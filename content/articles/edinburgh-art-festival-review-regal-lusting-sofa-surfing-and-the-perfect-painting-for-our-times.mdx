  Scotland’s queer king has a show of his own at Edinburgh and it’s as wild as
  any fringe event. Where else will you get explosions, witches and lacy ruffs
  all on the same bill? Step right up to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery
  for The World of James VI and I. James has become more box-office friendly
  lately, because of his passionate friendships with a series of male
  favourites, including the Duke of Buckingham, as seen on TV. You’ll find
  portraits of his favourite men here, the lushest by far being Rubens’ 1625
  painting of Buckingham, his cheeks flushed, moustache neatly upturned, eyes
  flashing. There’s an astrological watch, too, in an egg-shaped silver case
  that James presented to another favourite, the Earl of Somerset. This
  exhibition refuses, however, to pin down the exact nature of James’s
  sexuality, seeing it as just part of his times. When his voyage home from
  Elsinore Castle with his new bride was hit by storms, he blamed witches. His
  book Daemonologie incited Scottish witch-hunting and inspired Shakespeare to
  write Macbeth. The world he lived in was full of invisible magical forces. On
  view are relics of that universe, including a bezoar, to protect from poison,
  and the Charmstone of the Stewarts of Ardsheal. If James was superstitious and
  hungry for love, his violent childhood may explain it. A wonderfully weird
  painting shows him as a child praying by the monument of his father, Lord
  Darnley, murdered in 1567 by the unusual method of blowing up the house where
  he was staying in Edinburgh. A print portrays the beheading of his mother in
  1587. These are strange events from a time in history that is alien to us, yet
  the portraits here make us feel close to these people. James’s jester, Tom
  Derry, is utterly alive in a careworn, sensitive portrait by Marcus Gheeraerts
  the Younger. As for the king himself, he goes through many changes. The
  virtual twin of Mary, Queen of Scots in a 1583 double portrait, even more
  “feminine” in a ruff-heavy painting a few years later, increasingly louche yet
  roughed up in later portraits. This terrific exhibition brings history to life
  without battering it into a 21st-century plaything. An even more remote past
  is magically, jerkily performed by glass marionettes in Wael Shawky’s Cabaret
  Crusades III: The Secrets of Karbala. This ravishing film work at Talbot Rice
  Gallery is already an acknowledged classic of 21st-century art and comes to
  Edinburgh at a time when war again rages in the lands where, in the 11th and
  12th centuries AD, Christians and Muslims fought for Jerusalem. You won’t find
  glib contemporary parallels in Egyptian artist Shawky’s screen epic. He does
  everything possible to estrange the Crusades, acted by puppets as if this were
  a slow, contemplative Thunderbirds. Cabaret Crusades takes you not just to
  another time but another way of telling it, in its own words. He refutes the
  historical nonsense of jihadis treating the Crusades as a living grievance
  just as much as he recovers an Arab view of a story often told through western
  sources. This is, in short, a phenomenally serious and complex achievement
  that is also hypnotically beautiful. The Middle Eastern past appears again as
  enigmatic, poetic ruins in Mike Nelson’s photographs of a ruinous Turkish city
  at Fruitmarket Gallery. They are hung at the bottom of the gallery walls, with
  bare lightbulbs and low benches, to encourage intimacy with how the artist
  imagines this lost world. Roland Barthes wrote of his fixation on a
  19th-century photograph of the Alhambra: “I want to live there.” Nelson
  confesses something similar, then undercuts it with an installation in another
  part of the gallery representing a now-demolished housing estate: a
  reconstruction that becomes an impossible, ensnaring labyrinth. As you move
  through one dingy, derelict claustrophobic room and corridor after another,
  anxiety mounts. Where is this leading? The Edinburgh Dungeon next door has
  nothing on this. You can never go back to the past, says Nelson. If you did it
  would be a nightmare. In general, art that is ambivalent and poetic has more
  to say than art that is simplistic and didactic. Unfortunately, there is some
  of the latter in Edinburgh, too. Siân Davey’s exhibition The Garden at the
  Stills Gallery takes the opposite of Shawky’s thoughtful approach. Davey and
  her son created a wildflower garden and invited their friends and neighbours
  to share this healing space. Good for them. But Davey’s big, intensely
  coloured photos of her garden community, with some people going nude in
  nature, are pure bathos. To make me believe this flowery paradise is a shelter
  and hope for the marginalised and oppressed, I would need more than mawkish
  oversharing. This is flower-power nonsense, half a century too late.
  Recovering from that, I turn to Aubrey Levinthal’s nuanced, elusive paintings
  at the Ingleby. The gallery is well worth seeking out, tucked down a side
  street in the classical New Town, and in Levinthal it has discovered a major
  contemporary painter. She depicts her quiet, middle-class family life in
  Philadelphia, but it is the way she paints it that’s wondrous. Planes of
  almost abstract colour turn out to be sofas or laptops. A vase of Hockneyesque
  flowers seems to emerge from a boy resting on a sofa; the man in her life, in
  a nice reversal of art’s old hierarchies, is portrayed as a classical bearded
  beauty, sprawled in a chair, her idealised, brainless muse. In the most
  haunting painting here, she studies her son, in a triple image, as he
  contemplates a glowing iPad screen. It’s a painting for our times. Until 24
  August
