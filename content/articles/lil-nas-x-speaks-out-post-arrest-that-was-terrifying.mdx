  Lil Nas X has released his first statement since his arrest in the early hours
  of 21 August. The 26-year-old rapper and singer posted a story on his
  Instagram to comment on the incident. “Your girl is gonna be OK, y’all,” he
  said to the camera. He added: “That was fucking terrifying. That was
  terrifying. That was a terrifying last four days but your girl’s gonna be all
  right.” The Grammy-winning star, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, was
  found walking in his underwear on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles shortly
  before 6am. Authorities claim that after being confronted by police he charged
  at them, which led to his arrest. Due to suspicions of an overdose, he was
  taken to hospital and later held on $75,000 bail, conditional on attending
  drug treatment. On Monday, Hill was charged with three counts of battery with
  injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting an executive
  officer. He pleaded not guilty in a court appearance. “Attacking police
  officers is more than just a crime against those individuals but a direct
  threat to public safety,” LA county’s district attorney, Nathan J Hochman,
  said in a statement. “Assuming the allegations here are true, this is an
  absolute aberration in this person’s life,” Hill’s lawyer Christy O’Connor
  said in court, according to NBC. “Nothing like this has ever happened to him.”
  The star’s father, Robert Stafford, has also denied that drugs were involved,
  saying “absolutely not” when asked by reporters. “He’s in good spirits. He’s
  all right,” he said. “He’s very remorseful for what happened.” Lil Nas X
  gained fame after his track Old Town Road became a record-breaking No 1 hit,
  staying at the top of the charts for 19 weeks. He also had success with songs
  including Industry Baby and Montero (Call Me by Your Name).
