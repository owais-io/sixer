  I first saw Terence in The Collector (1965) when I was a kid. It stuck in my
  head as the ultimate horror film – it terrified the daylights out of me.
  Terence’s greatest beauties were his eyes – in some of the early films you
  don’t see it, but in person, when they were shining, he could hold a room.
  He’d sit there and say, “Watch this, I’m going to stop a restaurant.” And he
  could do it. I saw him do it! It was extraordinary. He once told me that he
  used to have real fun on Superman when he was bored, stuck on top of the ice
  castle. “I’d just stare down until everyone went quiet,” he said. We tried
  many actors when casting Bernadette in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of
  the Desert, but absolutely everybody turned the role down. Terence was easily
  on the top of our list, but we thought he’d never do it. The honest truth is,
  he turned it down at first. But out of nowhere, his agent said to him, “Well,
  you’re bored. You’ve just done superhero movies. Why don’t you do something
  else?” It was astonishing when his agent reached out and said, “No, he wants
  to talk.” We were falling over ourselves. If he wanted the role, it was his.
  We talked long and hard about why he’d initially said no. It was fear. And
  fair enough – you have got to remember we were coming out of the HIV/Aids
  mess. It was a taboo subject. I looked at the work that he’d done all the way
  through, like the Italian years when he worked with Fellini and Pasolini, and
  thought: this was a man who took chances. And I think he was at absolutely the
  right moment in his life where he was ready for another chance. Terence
  admitted he was absolutely terrified to play Bernadette – he was being voted
  one of the best-looking men on earth and suddenly in Priscilla he was, and
  this is a direct quote, “dressed up as an old dog”. But he put the pain of
  what he was going through into the performance, and that’s what made the film.
  In my head, I had a very clear idea of who Bernadette was. I remember looking
  at Terence when he came out presented as Bernadette for the first time. I
  said, “Well this isn’t what I pictured in my head, but it’s interesting. Let’s
  talk about it.” Meanwhile, Terence looked at the mirror and completely
  exploded. From that point in the film, no mirrors were allowed. It was the
  fear. But he worked it in – he knew what he was doing. Every day, they’d say,
  “You want to see rushes?” And he’d say, “No. If I’m committing, I’m going for
  it.” By the time we finished the shoot, he was way past being afraid and
  Priscilla was a real high point for him. Over the years, we became very close.
  He was a loner, but we became really good pals. Anytime I was anywhere near
  him, I would visit. Once you got through the layers, he was an East End boy, a
  working-class boy, and I think over the years, the thing I most loved was that
  he let me into that world. And sometimes it was very foul-mouthed! Terence
  would complain that he was only ever asked about two things: Priscilla or
  Superman. The amount of times he said to me, “Far From the Madding Crowd
  [1967] – I’ve never worked so hard at something so magnificent and it has been
  forgotten.” I said, “It’s called time, Terence.” He said, “But Priscilla is 30
  years old. Why doesn’t it go away? They only ask me about two films, and one
  of them’s fucking Priscilla.” And I’d get the giggles. That’s when we began
  talking about a Priscilla sequel. On that front, let’s just say – he agreed to
  do the sequel a few years ago and we’ve been particularly busy over the past
  year. By the end of his career, he was working to keep himself entertained. He
  was discerning – if he’d already seen something like it, he didn’t care. If
  something pressed his buttons and piqued his interest, he’d consider it. His
  Italian years were just breathtaking. Who the hell gets to work with all those
  people? He said to me, “I just drifted from one to the other – if somebody had
  something interesting, I’d do it. That’s the way it’s always been.” Terence
  kept to himself. He was an enigma. And then he’d show up, use the eyes and
  turn everybody to jelly. He was a wonderful man – and he’s not done yet.
