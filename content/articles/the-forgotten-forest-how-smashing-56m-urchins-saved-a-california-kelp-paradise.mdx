  On an overcast Tuesday in July, divers Mitch Johnson and Sean Taylor shimmy
  into their wetsuits on the back of the R/V Xenarcha, a 28ft boat floating off
  the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles. Behind them, the clear
  waters of the Pacific are dotted with a forest of army-green strands, waving
  like mermaid hair underwater. We are here to survey the giant Pacific kelp, a
  species that once thrived in these ice cold waters. But over the past two
  decades, a combination of warm ocean temperatures, pollution, overfishing and
  the proliferation of hungry sea urchins that devour the kelp has led to an 80%
  decline in the forest along the southern California coast. In recent years,
  scientists have staged a comeback – mounting one of the largest and most
  successful kelp restoration projects in the world. To do so, they’ve recruited
  an army of hammer-wielding divers to smash and clean up the voracious urchins.
  Today’s trip is a chance to see that success up close. Seen from the boat’s
  edge, the kelp fronds are so thick and sturdy at places that they form mats at
  the ocean’s surface, sturdy enough for egrets and herons to perch on while
  they poked at the fish beneath. These waters host a multitude of species, from
  bright orange garibaldi fish and white sharks that silently cruise the
  coastline to blue whales which sail through the deep channel a few miles to
  our east. Divers like Johnson and Taylor have a variety of tools at their
  disposal. Some days, they pick up rock hammers – like an underwater version of
  the seven dwarves – and dive to crack open the ravenous purple urchins that
  destroy the baby kelp. But today, they are armed only with a tape and a camera
  to survey the status of this gigantic concealed forest. Gear on, the divers
  give a thumbs-up to Tom Ford, chief executive officer of the Bay Foundation, a
  non-profit dedicated to restoring Santa Monica Bay and its coastal waters, who
  is piloting the boat. With a small splash, they disappear into the water. Ford
  and I wait, with the quiet slapping of waves on the side of the Xenarcha, to
  see what they find. Led by the Bay Foundation, divers in the Santa Monica Bay
  have spent 15,575 hours underwater over the past 13 years. To bring the kelp
  back, they focus on minimizing the impact of one voracious eater: the purple
  urchin. The effort has been successful, smashing 5.8 million purple urchins
  and clearing 80.7 acres (32.7 hectares, the size of 61 football fields), and
  allowing the kelp to return. But with the results contained far offshore and
  underwater, has anyone noticed? Ford wonders the same thing. “We call it the
  forgotten forest,” he says. Cathedrals in the sea The fast-growing kelp
  ecosystems are known as the “sequoias of the sea” for good reason: they store
  large amounts of carbon, create habitat for more than 800 marine species and
  blunt the powerful force of storm waves. Technically, they are a macro-algae,
  and can grow as much as 2ft each day, reaching 100ft from reef bed to surface.
  For those lucky enough to see the kelp from under the waves, it can feel like
  a fairytale – a forest, but instead of walking through it, you’re flying
  underwater. Ford still remembers the first time he dived into the forest as a
  scuba diver. The sunlight looked like tongues of flame rippling through the
  blades from underwater, and the shafts of light peeked through the small holes
  in the canopy. “It looked like a cathedral, with light shooting through the
  stained glass,” he says. “And sometimes you float down through this and
  there’s thousands of fish of all sorts of colors just flitting around
  everywhere. It’s like flying through an unimaginably dense forest of life.”
  But for a time, these glorious environments were at risk of disappearing. When
  the Bay Foundation started working in these waters in 2012, the sea bed looked
  like carpets of purple – blanketed in endemic golf ball-sized spiky urchins.
  It was a symptom of an ecosystem gone haywire, with multiple overlapping
  injuries: sea otters, which eat urchins as a staple of their diet, were almost
  wiped out by hunters in the 19th century. Then, from the 1940s to the 1970s, a
  large amount of DDT was discharged from a chemical plant into the sea off
  Palos Verdes. Sediment from landslides also buried the reefs in silt,
  preventing anything from growing. More recently, the local sea stars, which
  eat the urchins, were hit with a wasting disease, and turned to goo. All that
  was left was urchins, which eat kelp at an incredible rate, and scratched the
  reef bed so much that any kelp spores still circulating couldn’t grab a
  foothold. Ford and the Bay Foundation did multiple tests to determine the
  optimal amount of urchins per square meter: two. Meanwhile, some areas of the
  barrens had 70-80 urchins per meter. Since they didn’t have much to eat, they
  were basically empty zombie urchins – hungry, empty of their meat, just
  hanging on and preventing kelp from growing. There was a lot to do. The Bay
  Foundation applied for grants from the state and federal authorities and
  started hiring divers, gathering 75 volunteers, and even working with
  commercial fishers to help out. Ford points out that the team was not smashing
  the healthy urchins that people depend on for their livelihood. “We were
  paying the fishermen to put back the forest, and then they could then go back
  in and fish from there again,” he says. That’s the case with Terry Herzik, a
  longtime red sea urchin fisher, who started working with the foundation in
  2012, spending nine hours a day smashing urchins instead of collecting them
  for sale. “No one has more hours down there clearing urchins than Terry,” says
  Ford, gesturing to Herzik’s boat, the Sun Spot, which is anchored nearby. “We
  could not have achieved this without him.” Slowly, methodically, divers
  ventured down out and smashed urchins week after week, clearing the plots.
  Hitting an urchin with a foot-long rock hammer gives “a satisfying crunch”,
  Johnson says. He is quick to point out that this is manual labor, just
  underwater (and while wearing a cumbersome scuba suit). The divers talk about
  their job almost as if they are part of a construction crew – it’s repetitive
  work, but fulfilling, like filling potholes in the ocean. “You just tap, tap,
  and sometimes you have to reach into crevices to get the urchins out,” says
  Taylor. “Your forearms get super tired.” But the real benefit is seeing how
  quickly the kelp returns when the urchins are under control – in some cases
  within a matter of months. That’s because the microscopic single-celled kelp
  spores are wafting in the water column all the time – much like seeds of a
  plant carried by the wind – waiting for the right conditions to attach to the
  reef and start growing. Johnson remembers one spot along the coast that he
  worked on. “Within three months, the kelp came back,” he says. “I’ve never
  seen a kelp forest that dense – and it was insane to see how quickly it
  returned.” With a little kelp from my friends Taylor and Johnson, who both
  work for the Bay Foundation, resurface and haul themselves on to the back of
  the boat. Shaking the sea water out of their hair, they describe what they saw
  in the survey area: tons of fish, a small shark and a forest of green.
  “There’s still a lot of kelp,” Johnson tells Ford, but it’s not all good news.
  “There’s still a pocket where the urchins are expanding out.” It’s still a
  mystery why some areas stay restored with kelp, while others return to
  barrens. The boat moves on to another point on the coast, where the divers
  descend again. Here, the kelp forest is so thick that it forms a mat keeping
  the boat in place. “I don’t know if we need to anchor,” Ford says. “I’ll just
  let the algae hold me.” Ford and I lift up a kelp frond from the edge of the
  boat. It’s slippery, rubbery and slightly slimy. On the top, I can see a
  colony of bryozoans – tiny filter-feeding invertebrates that live on the
  surface of the kelp. Teensy shrimp and snails also gather on the fronds:
  evidence of its importance as a habitat for so many creatures. I run my
  fingers along the blades that are just starting to differentiate and grow the
  bulbs that keep the structure afloat. Even as a parent to fast-growing
  children, it’s hard to imagine the speed at which this algae moves – always
  upward, always out. “Everything flows from the kelp.” Ford says. The project
  could be a model for other parts of the world where kelp is struggling. In
  Tasmania and South Korea, efforts are under way to save kelp. California’s
  Santa Barbara channel is also a target for future restoration work. With blobs
  of warmer oceans in a climate-changed future, kelp may still be at risk – but
  there are hopeful signs. The sites that have been restored remain mostly
  intact. The foundation’s research shows that California spiny lobster have
  returned to the area, and fish such as kelp bass and sheepshead are more
  abundant now than before restoration work started. The kelp also improves
  water quality, absorbing excess nutrients, and keeps sediments in place in a
  similar way that trees hold the land from sliding after rains. And the
  improvements even benefited the valuable red sea urchins – in sites where the
  kelp has been restored, red sea urchin gonads (the prized parts, also known as
  uni) weigh 168% more. While the effect of the urchins has been devastating,
  Ford points out that kelp has always faced challenges: from powerful waves
  that rip out the strands from the seabed, to summertime temperatures that kill
  off the nutrients needed to grow. That has made the kelp super-resilient – and
  ready to pounce at any opportunity to regrow. “Part of the reason why we see
  such a rapid response to the restoration is because the system has evolved to
  respond rapidly to beneficial conditions,” he says. Perhaps the kelp will have
  a fairytale future after all – one that helps the planet, the people and the
  coastline into the next century.
