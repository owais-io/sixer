  An unlikely alliance of farmers, bikers, truckers, a detective and scientists
  from across the political spectrum are working to pressure the Trump
  administration and Republican leadership to rein in the use of toxic sewage
  sludge as fertilizer on the nation’s farmland. Sludge often teems with Pfas,
  or “forever chemicals”, which present a health risk to farmers and the public,
  and have destroyed farms and contaminated water across the country. The issue
  has touched the groups’ lives in different ways, highlighting its broad risks
  to health. “We can all sit down and agree that we and our children shouldn’t
  be fed literal poison,” said Dana Ames, a Johnson county, Texas, detective who
  is organizing the group. In Oklahoma, farmer Saundra Traywick lives in an area
  where she says toxic sewage sludge is spread as fertilizer. Her family and
  animals get sick, and the potent stench can be unbearable. Mike “Lucky”
  Pruitt, a biker who lives in a dairy- and oil-producing region in Texas,
  wonders whether Pfas from sludge contributed to the rare brain cancer that
  killed his six-year-old son; in Johnson county, Texas, Ames took the
  unprecedented step of opening a criminal investigation, which is ongoing, over
  sludge that polluted local farms and water. Billy Randal, a trucker, just
  learned about the sludge’s dangers, and fears that people hauling the
  substance are exposed to toxic waste. And in Massachusetts, Kyla Bennett, a
  former US Environmental Protection Agency scientist and cancer survivor, is
  part of a lawsuit that could lead to sludge being banned. Ames said the
  alliance has a real chance of success because it includes everyone from
  liberal scientists to people on the far right – they are willing to set aside
  political differences for the fight. “The American people are smart – once we
  figure out what’s occurring, we have a whole lot more in common than we don’t,
  and this is a basic human right,” said Ames, the Texas detective. “We all
  deserve safe and clean food and water.” Ames is organizing rallies that she
  hopes will draw thousands of people in Austin, Texas, and Washington DC in the
  coming months, aiming to get Trump’s attention and to pressure the Texas
  legislature to act. Bringing in the president’s base in deep red Texas is
  essential, Ames said. “I speak their language – they’re probably not going to
  listen to liberal scientists,” Ames said. Getting Trump’s attention Sludge is
  a mix of human and industrial waste, and a byproduct of the wastewater
  treatment process that regulators allow to be used as fertilizer because it’s
  rich in nutrients that help plants grow. It also virtually always teems with
  Pfas and other dangerous chemicals, which contaminate water, crops and
  livestock, while also sickening farmers and contaminating the nation’s food
  supply. Maine became the first state to ban sludge, also called biosolids,
  after it found Pfas had contaminated crops or water on at least 73 farms where
  the substance had been spread. The state established a $70m fund to bail out
  affected farmers. Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds that are dubbed
  “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down. The chemicals are
  linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, liver disease,
  kidney issues, high cholesterol, birth defects and decreased immunity. In the
  Biden administration’s final days, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment for
  Pfas in sludge that could effectively ban the substance, but Republicans in
  Congress slipped a rider into the current appropriations bill that would
  essentially kill the process by withdrawing key funding. The rider was
  inserted just a few weeks after the EPA met with a sludge industry trade group
  to hear its grievances about the assessment. Ames said the EPA “has gone
  rogue” and she suspects Trump is unaware of the situation. The president has
  publicly said he wants clean water and food, Ames said, and she suspects he
  will act if alerted. “As his voters and his base, we want his ear, and we want
  to make sure that the president knows what’s going on,” Ames said. In
  Massachusetts, Bennett, the scientist, who is now with the Public Employees
  for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) non-profit, has been frustrated with
  the Biden and Trump administrations’ policies on sludge, and has sued the EPA
  under the Clean Water Act to force the agency to regulate the substance. Peer
  is assisting with letters for Ames’s action, though it is not directly
  involved with organizing the rallies. It’s not often that Peer works with
  folks on the right, but the “strange bedfellows” are a hopeful development,
  Bennett said. “This is an issue that should transcend politics because it
  affects human health and people are humans before they’re Republicans and
  Democrats,” Bennett said. ‘We’ve got to make a change’ In 2021, doctors
  diagnosed six-year-old Rylan Pruitt with a rare and aggressive brain cancer.
  After 30 rounds of radiation treatment and several months of chemotherapy, he
  died, leaving behind distraught parents looking for answers. There was no
  family history of cancer, and his father, Mike “Lucky” Pruitt, began to hear
  about the risks of Pfas. He turned his attention to the massive dairy and oil
  operations – both known sources of Pfas and other chemical pollution – in the
  rural community in which he lives. Only about 50 other people have developed
  the type of cancer that killed Rylan – and one of them was a young girl who
  lived about 11 miles (17km) away, Pruitt said. He said he put together the
  pieces, like family history, how the cancer was “stupidly and exceedingly
  rare”, and the research that has connected sludge and Pfas to rare pediatric
  cancers. “For me it’s: ‘This is why this is happening, and we’ve got to make a
  change,’” Pruitt said. His 15,000-member motorcycle group, the Rylan Strong
  Network, pressures lawmakers on issues around pediatric cancer and health
  insurance. He contacted every Texas legislator asking them to support a bill
  that would require measuring Pfas in sludge. So far, very few have responded,
  and previous versions of the legislation were killed. “It’s all about who has
  the biggest checkbook,” Pruitt said. In Oklahoma, Traywick’s non-profit, Save
  Oklahoma Farms and Ranches, has had similar results in pressuring lawmakers.
  Her kids’ immune disorders, the flies that gnaw her donkeys’ legs raw and the
  unmeasured effects of suspected Pfas on land and water – none of it has so far
  convinced state legislators to act. But, she said, she is more optimistic as
  “a growing movement of people is waking up to the fact that this is not
  Democrats versus Republicans or left versus right – we all want our children
  to have a healthy future,” Traywick said. In New Jersey, Randal, founder of
  the national Truckers Movement for Justice, just learned about the sludge from
  Ames, and worries about what people hauling the waste are exposed to. The
  truckers, with thousands of members in the US and Mexico, recently worked with
  environmental groups to petition the US Department of Transportation to
  strengthen regulations around hauling fracking waste. The problem with sludge
  is similar, Randal said. Many drivers have to clean their trucks, there are
  few protections and they are not made aware of the Pfas and other risks in
  what they’re hauling. “We have truck drivers handling this shit and they don’t
  have a clue about what they’re working around,” Randal said. “Industry laughs
  all the way to the bank and it’s time for it to stop.” He plans to mobilize
  truckers to join the rallies. In Johnson county, Texas, Ames is focused on
  Goldman Sachs-owned Synagro, which sold local farmers the tainted sludge that
  polluted local waters and destroyed the land. She said the companies are
  motivated by “corporate greed”. The farms’ drinking water was found to be
  contaminated at levels more than 13,000 times higher than the federal health
  advisory for Pfos, one kind of Pfas compound, and affected meat was as much as
  250,000 times above safe levels, a federal lawsuit against Synagro alleges.
  Synagro denies that the Pfas came from its sludge. Last year, Ames opened the
  first-ever criminal investigation into the situation, and Johnson county
  joined Peer’s Clean Water Act lawsuit. “We’re coming together and we’re
  saying: ‘No, this isn’t a third-world country, and there’s no reason why in
  America our food should be poisoned like this,’” Ames said.
