  Emma Raducanu has avoided the top seeds in the first two rounds of the US Open
  but still faces a challenging path as she tries to convert her recent positive
  form into a first match win in New York since her shock triumph here four
  years ago. Britain’s Raducanu, who is unseeded, will open her tournament
  against a qualifier. However, she could face the in-form 24th seed Veronika
  Kudermetova, a recent semi-finalist at the Cincinnati Open, in round two. A
  potential third-round opponent is a resurgent Elena Rybakina, the 2022
  Wimbledon champion and another semi-finalist in Cincinnati last week. Last
  year marked a low point for Raducanu as she lost in the first round after
  missing most of the US hard-court swing. This time, she is as match-tough as
  she has been over the past few years, establishing a consistently high level
  over the past few months and pushing Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, to a
  final-set tie-break in their three-hour tussle in Cincinnati. Now ranked No
  35, Raducanu missed out on being seeded in New York by just one spot. In his
  return to singles competition, after missing the entire US hardcourt swing,
  Raducanu’s fellow British player Jack Draper will also face a qualifier or
  lucky loser in his opening-round match. Draper, seeded fifth, has not competed
  in singles since Wimbledon after being diagnosed with a left forearm injury.
  However, he looked healthy and well prepared during his semi-final run in the
  mixed doubles alongside Jessica Pegula this week. One year on from his
  breakthrough run to the US Open semi-final, Draper has been drawn in Jannik
  Sinner’s quarter, but a quarter-final rematch with his old friend is a long
  way away with quality opponents such as Gabriel Diallo, Lorenzo Musetti and
  Flavio Cobolli in his section. The women’s field is headed by Sabalenka, who
  will open her defence against the world No 109, Rebeka Masarova of
  Switzerland. Rybakina, who she could meet in the quarter-finals, is the most
  dangerous player in her section before the semi-finals and Pegula, the fourth
  seed, is the second-highest seed in the top half. Coco Gauff, the third seed,
  has been drawn in No 2-seeded Iga Swiatek’s half of the draw as she tries to
  find her way again after a difficult period since her French Open win in June.
  Swiatek is in fine form having won Wimbledon and the Cincinnati Open in recent
  weeks. The Pole will face Emiliana Arango of Colombia in the opening round.
  Venus Williams, meanwhile, has been drawn against the 11th seed Karolina
  Muchova in her 25th appearance at the US Open. Williams is the oldest entrant
  in the event in 44 years. Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the top two seeds, will
  attempt to consolidate their domination of men’s tennis with a third
  consecutive grand slam final meeting and fifth consecutive final overall.
  Sinner will begin his defence against Vit Kopriva of the Czech Republic and,
  along with a potential quarter-final against Draper, the third seed Alexander
  Zverev is his projected semi-final opponent. Alcaraz, however, has been handed
  a challenging first-round opponent in the big-serving Reilly Opelka, a former
  No 17 who stands at 6ft 11in. While the fourth seed Taylor Fritz – last year’s
  beaten finalist – is Alcaraz’s projected semi-final opponent by seeding, the
  seventh seed Novak Djokovic, who has been the best grand slam performer behind
  Sinner and Alcaraz this year with three consecutive semi-finals, looms in
  Fritz’s quarter. The 38-year-old has not competed since Wimbledon. Plenty of
  tough first-round ties await the rest of the British contingent. Katie Boulter
  will face the 27th seed Marta Kostyuk, and Sonay Kartal will line up against
  Beatriz Haddad Maia, the 18th seed. Cameron Norrie will play the American
  shotmaker Sebastian Korda, while Jacob Fearnley has been drawn against the
  Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut.
