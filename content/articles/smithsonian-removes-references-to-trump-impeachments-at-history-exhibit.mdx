  The Smithsonian Institution has scrubbed all mention of Donald Trump’s
  impeachments from a prominent display at the National Museum of American
  History, temporarily eliminating any acknowledgment of the president’s unique
  status as the only US leader the House impeached twice. The alterations to the
  presidential power exhibit, first reported by the Washington Post, occurred in
  July, with museum officials replacing contemporary signage with an older
  version that excludes Trump’s impeachment proceedings entirely. Visitors now
  see only a generic reference to three presidents facing potential removal from
  office. Museum representatives confirmed the changes followed an institutional
  review of exhibition content. “In reviewing our legacy content recently, it
  became clear that the ‘Limits of Presidential Power’ section in The American
  Presidency: A Glorious Burden exhibition needed to be addressed,” a
  Smithsonian spokesperson told the Guardian. “Because the other topics in this
  section had not been updated since 2008, the decision was made to restore the
  Impeachment case back to its 2008 appearance.” The spokesperson pledged that
  “a future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments,” though they
  provided no specific timeline for implementation. The move comes as Trump has
  waged a systematic campaign to reshape federal cultural agencies since
  returning to power, and issued directives aimed at purging what he categorizes
  as diversity initiatives and halting new federal appointments. Earlier this
  year, he signed an executive order directing the elimination of “anti-American
  ideology” across Smithsonian museums and promising to “restore the Smithsonian
  Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American
  greatness”. The order specifically targets several Smithsonian facilities for
  ideological review, including the National Museum of African American History
  and Culture. Trump faced impeachment charges twice during his first presidency
  – initially over allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate political
  rivals, then later for his role in the 6 January 2021 Capitol attack. The
  Senate cleared him on both occasions. That historic distinction has now
  vanished from the nation’s premier history museum, while displays covering
  Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon’s impeachment cases remain
  untouched. The spokesperson explained that temporary materials addressing
  Trump’s impeachments had been installed in September 2021 as “a short-term
  measure to address current events at the time, however, the label remained in
  place until July 2025”. The Smithsonian operates as a congressional trust with
  an annual budget exceeding $1bn and attracts millions of visitors annually to
  its network of museums, making it a key cultural touchstone for public
  education about American history.
