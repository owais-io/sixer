  An Irish aid worker and eight fellow captives have been released nearly a
  month after they were kidnapped in Haiti. Gena Heraty, a missionary who ran
  the Our Little Brothers and Sisters orphanage in the hills outside Haiti’s
  capital, Port-au-Prince, was abducted on 3 August along with seven Haitian
  colleagues and a three-year-old child. “We are relieved beyond words. We are
  so deeply grateful to everyone, in Haiti and internationally, who has worked
  tirelessly over these terrible weeks to help secure their safe return,” her
  family said in a statement. Simon Harris, Ireland’s tánaiste (deputy prime
  minister), celebrated the end of their “terrible ordeal” in a statement on
  social media. “We warmly welcome the news that Gena and all of the Haitian
  nationals taken captive on August 3, including a small child, have been
  released and are reported to be safe and well,” Harris said. “This has, of
  course, been an extraordinarily difficult and stressful situation for the
  Heraty family. I wish to pay tribute to their resilience and determination to
  support Gena and her fellow captives over these past difficult weeks,” Harris
  added, calling Heraty “a respected humanitarian and deeply courageous person
  who has dedicated her life to supporting the most vulnerable people in Haiti”.
  Heraty had reportedly been living in Haiti for 32 years and had been
  responsible for about 270 children at the orphanage in Kenscoff. Haiti has
  been thrust into a seemingly interminable spiral of violence since February
  last year when politically connected and heavily armed gangs launched a
  coordinated uprising against the government. Criminal groups now control
  virtually the entire capital and a UN-backed policing mission has failed to
  stop gang foot-soldiers rampaging across the Caribbean city. The situation has
  become so dire that authorities have resorted to using armed drones and
  recruiting foreign mercenaries in an attempt to win back control of the city.
  Ireland’s department of foreign affairs strongly advises its citizens not to
  visit the Caribbean country as a result of the “extremely volatile” security
  situation. “There are frequent clashes between gangs and security forces.
  Kidnappings, robberies, and violent crime are prevalent,” its website warns.
  According to the Irish Independent, Heraty’s group was abducted after armed
  attackers stormed the building at about 3.30am on a Sunday morning. “They
  broke through a wall to enter the property before heading to the building
  where the director was staying, leaving with nine hostages,” the local mayor
  said at the time. Some reports claimed the kidnappers were part of Viv Ansanm
  (Live Together), the criminal coalition which rose up last year, plunging
  Haiti’s capital into chaos.
