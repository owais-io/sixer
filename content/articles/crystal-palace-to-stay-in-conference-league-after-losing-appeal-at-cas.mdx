  Crystal Palace have lost their appeal against demotion from the Europa League
  and will take their place in the Conference League. The court of arbitration
  for sport confirmed on Monday that the FA Cup winners were unsuccessful in
  overturning the decision made by European football’s governing body to punish
  them for contravening its rules over multi-club ownership. Uefa demoted Palace
  to the Conference League after they were deemed to have breached regulations
  because John Textor held shares in Palace and Lyon, who also qualified for the
  Europa League. He has since sold his 44.9% stake to his fellow US businessman
  Woody Johnson. At the Cas hearing held on Friday in Lausanne, a Palace
  delegation led by the chair, Steve Parish, said Textor had never held a
  decisive influence in the boardroom and was no longer at the club. They are
  also understood to have argued they had been singled out by Uefa and that its
  rules had not been applied consistently. Palace are believed to have presented
  evidence that only members of the European Club Association (ECA) were
  informed that Uefa’s 1 March deadline for setting up a blind trust to comply
  with multi-club regulations could be extended until 31 May. That enabled the
  Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, to place the club into a blind
  trust at the end of April. Marinakis also owns Olympiakos. Cas said: “After
  considering the evidence, the panel found that John Textor, founder of Eagle
  Football Holdings, had shares in CPFC and OL and was a Board member with
  decisive influence over both clubs at the time of Uefa’s assessment date. The
  panel also dismissed the argument by CPFC that they received unfair treatment
  in comparison to Nottingham Forest and OL. The panel considered that the Uefa
  regulations are clear and do not provide flexibility to clubs that are
  non-compliant on the assessment date, as CPFC claimed.” Forest, who qualified
  for the Conference League after finishing seventh in the Premier League, are
  expected to be promoted to the Europa League. Palace are due to have a
  Conference League playoff against the losers of the Europa League qualifier
  between Norway’s Fredrikstad or Midtjylland of Denmark. The first leg is
  scheduled at Selhurst Park on 21 August, three days before Forest play there
  in the Premier League. Parish was asked about the appeal at Sunday’s Community
  Shield, when Palace beat Liverpool on penalties, and said: “I’m determined
  that we get the right outcome – if we don’t, we’ll have to look at if there’s
  any steps after that. But after Friday, I don’t understand how we can not be
  in the competition.” Palace have estimated that missing out on the Europa
  League could cost them up to £20m and it is understood they will consider
  making a claim against Uefa for compensation.
