  There are seven defining themes for the UK in the remaining months of 2025,
  and beyond, says Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja. They are:
  Are we due a growth slowdown? Raja thinks we are, partly due to Donald Trump’s
  trade war, and a slowdown in public sector spending. The 2025/26 QT decision –
  how will the Bank of England change its strategy of selling bonds bought under
  quantitative easing? The Autumn Budget. The labour market story (quantities) –
  are we on the up? Peak CPI: how high can we go? Deutsche expect inflation to
  peak at 3.9% later this year, with risks skewed to a 4% print. Private sector
  pay settlements. These will be influenced by the decision on the next increase
  to the National Living Wage. Will they, or won’t they? One more cut this year?
  Raja expects the Bank of England to cut Bank Rate once more this year. The
  jump in UK bond yields today shows that Keir Starmer’s reshuffle of his Number
  10 team has not reassured investors, says Mohit Kumar, chief economist at
  investment bank Jefferies International. That reshuffle tooks to be Starmer’s
  attempt to take control of economic policy from the Treasury, with Darren
  Jones put in charge of day-to-day delivery and Minouche Shafik, the former
  Bank of England deputy governor, appointed the prime minister’s chief economic
  adviser. Kumar told clients this morning: Fiscal concerns are being felt in
  the UK as well with 30Y Gilts yields close to the highest level since 1998.
  The recent economic reshuffle in the government did little to ease investor
  concerns and is seen as undermining Chacellor Reeves. Tax rises are
  inevitable, but we are reaching a stage where further tax rises could become
  counterproductive. So far the government has shied away from difficult
  decisions on spending cuts which would be required to bring the fiscal picture
  back in order. We remain negative on the UK long end and continue to favour
  steepeners along the curve. Other governments are also being hit by rising
  borrowing costs today. Germany’s 30-year yield has risen to a 14-year high,
  tracking a climb in U.S. Treasury yields, Reuters reports. But at 3.399%, it
  is still much cheaper for Berlin to borrow for the next three decades than the
  UK. Newsflash: British 30-year government bond yields have hit their highest
  since 1998, intensifying the pressure on the UK Treasury. The 30-year gilt
  yield has risen to 5.680% in early trading, over the previous 27-year high set
  in April. Yields measure the interest rate which an investor receives for
  holding a bond, and rise when the price of a bond falls. This rise in bond
  yields adds to Rachel Reeves’s headache as she tries to draw up this autumn’s
  budget. Higher borrowing costs could create a larger black hole to be filled
  through higher taxes or spending cuts. As covered in the introduction,
  long-term government borrowing costs have been pushed higher in recent weeks
  by worries over fiscal sustainability, and rising inflation. Jim Reid of
  Deutsche Bank told clients this morning: Even in orderly markets, we’re seeing
  a slow-moving vicious circle: rising debt concerns push yields higher,
  worsening debt dynamics, which in turn push yields higher again. This is
  turning into a turbulent week for chief executives. Last night, Nestlé
  dismissed its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation into an
  “undisclosed romantic relationship” with a subordinate, in breach of its code
  of business conduct. Now, Japanese drinks maker Suntory Holdings has announced
  that CEO and chairman Takeshi Niinami has resigned following a police
  investigation into his purchase of a potentially illegal supplement. Niinami
  told the company he purchased the supplement believing that it was legal,
  Suntory said in a statement. The Tokyo Shimbun newspaper had reported that
  police in Fukuoka prefecture have been conducting an investigation into
  whether supplements containing cannabis components had been sent to Niinami’s
  home in connection with a man who was arrested in July. Suntory, one of the
  world’s largest drinks companies, produces a range of spirits including
  bourbons such as Jim Beam, Japanese whisky brands including Hakushu, Roku gin,
  plus tequila, vodka and rum brands. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has
  warned that Donald Trump’s America is drifting into 1930s-style autocratic
  politics. In an interview with the Financial Times, Dalio warned that “gaps in
  wealth”, “gaps in values” and a collapse in trust were driving “more extreme”
  policies in the US. He cautioned: “I think that what is happening now
  politically and socially is analogous to what happened around the world in the
  1930-40 period.” It’s rare (and welcome!) to hear a big Wall Street name
  criticise Trump – other leading investors have taken a more submissive
  approach to the president. Dalio explained that other investors are too scared
  of the president to speak up, saying: “I am just describing the cause and
  effect relationships that are driving what is happening. And by the way,
  during such times most people are silent because they are afraid of
  retaliation if they criticise.” Dalio also criticised the US’s mounting
  national debt, warning that the country risks a “debt-induced heart attack in
  the relatively near future.” The bad news for finance ministers, such as
  Rachel Reeves, is that September has a track record as a bad month for
  long-dated bonds. Over the last decade, government bonds globally with
  maturities of over 10 years posted a median loss of 2% in September, according
  to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the worst monthly performance of the
  year. More here. Tokyo has fought off the bond vigilantes today, at a price!
  An auction of Japan’s 10-year government bonds today has seen the strongest
  demand since October 2023. Japan’s Ministry of Finance sold around 2.6
  trillion yen (£13bn) of 10-year notes. Investors were attracted by elevated
  yield levels, with total bids nearly four times higher than the amount of debt
  on offer. Bloomberg has more details; The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond
  fell 2.5 basis points to 1.595% after touching 1.625% Monday, close to the
  highest since 2008, and bond futures gained after the auction result. The
  bid-to-cover ratio jumped to 3.92 from 3.06 at last month’s sale, comfortably
  above the 12-month average. “The results were strong,” said Shuichi Ohsaki, a
  senior portfolio manager at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management’s fixed income
  management department. “Given the high yield level at around 1.6% and the
  large-scale buying, bonds with maturities of 10 years or less are being
  bought, especially since the market had been cautious,” he said. Traders have
  also been piling into silver, driving it over $40 per ounce for the first time
  since 2011. KCM Trade’s chief market analyst, Tim Waterer, says: “Silver is
  making a move higher in response to expectations of lower U.S. rates, while a
  tight supply market is helping to maintain an upward bias.” The gold has hit a
  new alltime high, as traders turn to precious metals as a safe-haven asset in
  inflationary times. While government bond prices are falling (driving up
  yields), the spot price of gold has climbed over the $3,500 mark to hit
  $3,508.50 an ounce early this morning, with investors flocking to this
  traditional safe-haven asset. The rally comes as the markets anticipate
  interest rate cuts in the US later this year, which has weakened the dollar.
  Traders have been piling into gold-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs), which
  lifts demand for the precious metals, while some central banks have been
  adding to their own holdings. Worries about inflation have also lifted demand
  for gold, as Tony Sycamore, IG analyst, explains: This week’s rally in gold
  and silver began mid-morning yesterday and coincided with a social media post
  by US President Trump who claimed that prices in the USA are “WAY DOWN” with
  virtually no inflation. However, this narrative contrasts with recent economic
  data showing persistent inflationary pressures remain and comes as President
  Trump continues his dovish reshaping of the Fed Board as he pushes for sooner
  and deeper Fed interest rate cuts, into an economy which is growing at ~3.5%
  in Q3 according to the latest Atlanta Fed GDP Now reading Good morning, and
  welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the
  world economy. The bond vigilantes are back, piling pressure on governments in
  London and Paris amid fears over fiscal sustainability. The UK’s long-term
  cost of borrowing is on the verge of hitting its highest level since 1998.
  Yesterday the yield, or interest rate, on Britain’s 30-year debt rose as high
  as 5.646%, just a whisker from the 27-year high of 5.649% set during trading
  on 9th April. That pushes up the cost of adding to Britain’s national debt,
  eating into the headroom available to chancellor Rachel Reeves as she draws up
  the autumn budget. Bond vigilantes punish governments for what they consider
  to be bad policy choices, by shunning debt auctions or by demanding higher and
  higher rates of return before buying government bonds. Fiscal concerns have
  been pushing up long-term borrowing costs globally in recent weeks; September
  is traditionally a tough month for the bond markets, so the next few weeks
  could be volatile. UK debt is in the firing line due to fears that the economy
  will slow later this year, and that Reeves faces a budget black hole that will
  need to be filled through either tax rises or spending cuts. As Deutsche
  Bank’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, told clients: At the risk of sounding
  a little dramatic, the Autumn Budget will be a defining moment for the UK. On
  our estimates, a fiscal hole worth GBP 20-25bn will need to be filled in
  November. Kathleen Brooks of XTB says August was “dreadful” for UK bonds,
  explaining: This summer’s drip feed of potential tax rises has not gone over
  well with voters, and Labour has been hemorrhaging support to Reform in recent
  weeks. Essentially voters don’t want tax rises, while Labour backbenchers
  don’t want spending cuts, but something will have to give. Political turmoil
  in Paris has pushed France’s bond yields higher in recent weeks too, widening
  the gap with Germany. The French government could fall next week, if it loses
  a confidence vote called over unpopular spending cuts. French 30-year bond
  yields hit a multi-year high of nearly 4.5% yesterday. ING fear French bonds
  could continue to be pummelled by political uncertainty, telling clients: The
  spread between French government bonds (OATs) and the German equivalent
  (Bunds) widened materially on the prospect of a confidence vote, and we still
  see the balance of risk tilted to further widening. The current 10Y spread is
  at a similar level to that seen in July 2024, when French President Emmanuel
  Macron called snap elections and OATs sold off significantly in response. The
