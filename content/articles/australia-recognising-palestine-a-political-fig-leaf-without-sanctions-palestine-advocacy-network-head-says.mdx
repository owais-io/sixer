  The Albanese government’s announcement it will recognise Palestinian statehood
  at the United Nations next month has been dubbed a “political fig leaf” by
  Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, which called on the government to cut
  ties with Israel. Labor’s move has also been met with criticism by the
  Coalition, which said it supports a two-state solution although it called
  recognition at the September meeting premature. Others, including Labor MPs
  and advocates, have welcomed the announcement. On Monday, Anthony Albanese
  said a two-state solution “is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of
  violence in the Middle East”. APAN in response accused the government of using
  recognition as a “political fig leaf” and said it would be completely
  meaningless while Australia continues to trade and have diplomatic relations
  with Israel. APAN president, Nasser Mashni, said the government should stop
  supplying arms to Israel and impose country-level sanctions. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email “Recognition is completely meaningless while Australia
  continues to trade, to supply arms, to have diplomatic relations and to
  diplomatically protect and encourage other states to normalise relations with
  the very state that is committing these atrocities,” he said. “Palestinian
  rights are not to be gifted by western states. They are not dependent on
  negotiation with or behaviour or approval of their colonial oppressors. “What
  I want today is for Palestinians not to be slaughtered … What I want as an
  Australian is our government not to be complicit in that slaughter ... What
  happens after that will be upon the Palestinian people when they have their
  agency to determine their self determination. “It’s not my job or Anthony
  Albanese’s to determine how Palestinians might seek this opportunity.” The
  opposition has criticised the move, which followed nations including France,
  the UK and Canada, claiming it “risks delivering Hamas one of its strategic
  objectives of the horrific terrorism of October 7.” In a statement the
  opposition leader, Sussan Ley, and shadow foreign minister, Michaelia Cash,
  said the decision puts Australia at odds with the US. “The Coalition has
  serious concerns about the Albanese Government’s decision to unilaterally
  recognise a Palestinian state outside of a proper peace and two-state
  process.” The Israeli embassy said the move would undermine Israel’s security
  and accused the government of abandoning the conditions it had set on Hamas
  and Palestine before recognising its statehood. Israel’s ambassador to
  Australia, Amir Maimon, said the move would not change the reality on the
  ground. “By recognising a Palestinian state while Hamas continues to kill,
  kidnap and reject peace, Australia undermines Israel’s security, derails
  hostage negotiations, and hands a victory to those who oppose coexistence,” he
  wrote. “Peace is built by ending terror, not rewarding it.” Labor MPs were
  quick to welcome the decision, including Ed Husic, who called it an important
  step. Husic had been publicly pushing for recognition and had implored
  Australia to join the growing international momentum. He argued on Monday that
  the move wasn’t merely symbolic, and would help provide a practical pathway to
  achieve peace. “Will this immediately end the starvation, what people are
  experiencing, innocent Palestinians, on the ground today? No, it will not and
  we have to be realistic about that,” Husic told ABC TV. “But for many of us in
  the Labor party who have pushed for this over many years, this is a fulfilment
  of what we wanted to see and what was provided for through a national
  platform.” Anne Aly, the first Muslim woman to sit in cabinet, told ABC TV the
  decision would be a circuit breaker. “Now is the time for that circuit
  breaker. The world … including Australia has just about pretty much had
  enough,” she said. “Recognition is not tokenistic, recognition is actually a
  pathway to a two-state solution.” The Greens welcomed the move to recognition,
  but the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said the
  government should ban all arms trade, including trading parts for the F-35
  fighter jet, and increase sanctions. “What Australia has done today is take a
  tiny step away from a shrinking and discredited minority of states, centred on
  the US and Israel, to join the overwhelming majority of nations that already
  recognise Palestine. “Genocide is not a communications problem, an escalating
  series of statements will not end it.” The deputy prime minister, Richard
  Marles, insisted on Sunday the government is not supplying weapons to Israel.
