  Days after Ghislaine Maxwell met with the deputy attorney general Todd
  Blanche, the convicted child sex trafficker and longtime Jeffrey Epstein
  girlfriend and procurer was moved from a women’s federal prison in
  Tallahassee, Florida, to a so-called “prison camp” in Texas, a dramatically
  more comfortable minimum-security environment with dormitory-style housing and
  fewer guards, sometimes called “Club Fed”. Maxwell’s new camp primarily houses
  nonviolent offenders, and the inmates there are reportedly livid, and probably
  not a little bit frightened, to be imprisoned with one of the world’s most
  notorious sex traffickers and alleged rapists. Maxwell, too, was not initially
  eligible for such a transfer, due to her sex offender status; connections at
  the Department of Justice had to waive a procedural requirement in order for
  the move to go through. The transfer appears to be a reward. As Donald Trump
  struggles to extract himself from the continuing fallout of the Epstein
  scandal, Maxwell finds herself, now, in the best position that she has been in
  since her one-time partner Epstein died in a jail cell in 2019. Suddenly, she
  has something that the president wants: the ability to say, truthfully or no,
  that Trump had nothing to do with Epstein’s sex trafficking. The president,
  too, has something that Maxwell wants: the ability to issue a pardon. Maxwell
  has always formed the dark center of the Epstein saga, a woman who appears to
  have been exceptionally dedicated to arranging Epstein’s life, facilitating
  his travel, luring new victims to his homes, and coordinating his sexual abuse
  over the course of decades. Alleged victims of Epstein recall being recruited
  by Maxwell in public places – including at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in
  Palm Beach – and through friends. They say that she inspected their bodies,
  brought them to Epstein’s homes, talked incessantly about sex, and instructed
  them in Epstein’s sexual preferences. They also say that Epstein and Maxwell
  sometimes made them available for sexual abuse by their friends. She is widely
  presumed to know more than she has yet been willing to tell about the extent
  to which Epstein’s large network of powerful businessmen, politicians, and
  financiers knew about or participated in his rapes and trafficking of
  children. What is less clear, at least at first, is what motivated her to
  facilitate the abuse, and what kept her so loyal to Epstein over so many
  years. Maybe this kind of life – one spent attending to men’s lesser desires –
  was always what Maxwell was destined for. The ninth and youngest child of a
  British media magnate, Maxwell was doted on by her father, the
  Czechoslovakia-born Robert Maxwell, and raised in Oxford in a family as
  obscenely wealthy as it was darkly tragic: one of her older brothers was in a
  hideous car accident just days after Ghislaine’s birth, and the boy lingered
  in a coma for years before dying before her 10th birthday. Her father financed
  her life as a high-class party girl – first in London, and then in New York –
  where she spent much of her time accompanying famous and wealthy men to the
  kind of rich people’s social functions that have a pretext of raising money
  for charity. She does not seem to have had aims beyond that: despite her ample
  resources and encouragement, Ghislaine never showed much sign of intellectual
  ambition, or political interest, or business acumen, or general curiosity. (A
  short-lived “ocean protection” charity that she founded accomplished little,
  and shut down after her arrest on sex trafficking charges.) It was not merely
  that Ghislaine was a product of an elite unburdened by principle, who often
  reduce their daughters to mere ornaments. It is that an ornament, it seems, is
  all that Ghislaine Maxwell ever aspired to be. It was not her charity, or her
  father’s publishing, that were Maxwell’s great passions. Her great passion
  appears to have been for the romantic attention of men – and specifically, her
  life’s greatest animating goal seems to have been to achieve, and keep, the
  attention of Jeffrey Epstein. From those accounts we have of their
  relationship – and admittedly, these are not always reliable, given how
  intense, widespread, and prurient the attention on their activities has been –
  it appears that Maxwell’s devotion to Epstein was intense. At her trial in
  2021, prosecutors entered into evidence a photo of a cleavage-bearing Maxwell
  with Epstein, massaging his foot. This seems to have been her posture toward
  Epstein for the entire time she knew him: slavish, nearly worshipful. The pair
  met sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Maxwell’s father, Robert, died
  in an apparent suicide in the ocean off the coast of the Canary Islands –
  aboard his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine – in late 1991. Soon thereafter, it was
  discovered that millions of dollars were missing from pension funds that he
  managed; two of Maxwell’s brothers were charged for their alleged role in the
  fraud. (They were later acquitted.) It was during this moment of rupture and
  imperiled status that Maxwell was romantically involved with Epstein. Her
  boyfriend would have served as a meal ticket as well as a source of
  validation: Maxwell is alleged to have received payments from Epstein totaling
  more than $30m; she told one of her victims that he bought her her New York
  City townhouse, just a few blocks from his own. By 1994, she was recruiting
  and grooming teenagers for his sexual abuse. Maybe Maxwell justified what she
  did for Epstein as kink – a kind of sexual libertinism that shrugged off the
  regressive, prurient mores of the lower classes. The 90s were the peak of a
  kind of reductive heterosexual sex-positivity: lots of women were telling
  themselves, and being told, that sexual submission was a mark of
  sophistication – that the more liberated they were, the more of men’s desires
  they would grant. But this is all speculation: trying to provide a
  rationalization for Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions evades the true terror of her,
  which is her seemingly profound and horrifying vacancy. To such a person,
  obedience does not require a justification. Unequal desire in love –
  particularly when the suffering lover is a woman – tends to elicit a kind of
  pity. Feminists, too, often depict women’s outsized desire for men as a form
  of gendered victimization. Generally, it is not seen as serious – women’s
  limerence, romantic obsession, and striving for men’s attention is broadly
  relegated to the realm of the adolescent and the vulgar, the embarrassing and
  the silly. But Maxwell’s case suggests such desire can breed not just
  frustrated vanity but also a kind of monstrousness. Untempered by principle or
  self-respect, it can contain in it the seed of the grotesque. In her efforts
  to please Epstein, and to make herself useful to him, Maxwell became something
  hideous and unforgivable. In her deficient, warped soul, it seems she lacked
  something that every woman must have: a morality that she valued more than
  male approval. • This story was amended on 7 August 2025. An earlier version
  reported that Robert Maxwell was born in Hungary, but he was born in
  Czechoslovakia. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist
