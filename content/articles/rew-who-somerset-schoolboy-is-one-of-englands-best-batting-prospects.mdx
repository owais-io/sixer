  As Thomas Rew reached the edge of the field he was greeted by elder brother
  James with the pair sharing the warmest of embraces, an open show of
  affection, Rew says, that are saved for “special occasions”. 8 August 2025
  more than ticked that box. Rew had bathed in the Somerset sunshine that Friday
  and the generous applause of a Taunton crowd treated to their first proper
  glimpse of a precocious talent. They had heard the whispers since his early
  teens: Rew was a first XI, if not international, banker and the 17-year-old’s
  unbeaten 84 from 81 balls had just steered his side to a white-ball victory
  over Durham. “It was a special feeling to walk off that pitch with the whole
  County Ground behind us,” Rew recalls. Rew’s runs that day that were
  impressive, but more eye-catching was his handling of a potentially tricky
  chase. He manipulated both field and ball, looking every inch a batter who had
  been there a thousand times before and barely failed. The latest of cuts
  fizzed past point, while checked drives looked effortless. If a gap was
  plugged, Rew unearthed another. A former England international among the
  opposition said afterwards that Rew was the best junior he had ever laid eyes
  on. For Rew’s parents it was an afternoon that was both proud and practical.
  Mum, Debbie, and Dad, Chris, have barely missed a run of either brother’s
  careers. While previously that has largely involved split travel, now both are
  Somerset first-team cricketers, that has changed. The younger Rew’s maiden
  first-team involvement came in May, just after he had signed a short-term
  Somerset contract. James was in England’s men’s Test squad, and Thomas
  provided wicketkeeping cover. Ultimately, James missed out on Ben Stokes’ XI
  so took his Somerset spot at Chester-le-Street. But after he was rapped on the
  finger batting, Thomas grabbed the gloves for Durham’s second innings. He wore
  James’s baggy white shirt. “I was pretty nervous walking out there with the
  boys,” Rew says a touch shyly. His words are doubtless true but, given his
  on-field composure, they are difficult to believe. “After I’d taken a couple
  of catches those nerves eased a little. Being sat there in the changing room
  in whites after a win and singing Blackbird was special. “It took me a few
  days to learn the words,” he responds through laughter when asked about the
  Wurzels classic that Somerset have adopted as a victory chant. “But I’ve sung
  it enough now – I’m pretty used to it.” Rew is referencing the seven
  renditions needed as Somerset reached the One-Day Cup semi-final against
  Worcestershire on Sunday. Alas, there was no number eight. Under James’s
  captaincy, Thomas was ever-present, making 308 runs at 44, and the tournament
  provided a rare extended spell of the pair sharing a field. A four-year age
  gap meant they played just a few times together at King’s College, while both
  being available for club cricket is as common as a dry English April. Their
  Taunton St Andrews teammates know them as the GOAT and Baby GOAT respectively.
  Thomas does, though, have happy memories of following James as a child. “We’d
  travel around watching him for Somerset under-10s and under-11s,” he says. “I
  loved going to those games and Dad would throw some balls at me in the nets.”
  Who was he in his mind’s eye? “I always enjoyed watching AB de Villiers. The
  way he bats is astonishing. I tried to copy him, and dad would try and get to
  get me to sweep like he used to. Jos Buttler is a huge one too as he came
  through Somerset’s academy and went to King’s.” Rew will return to school to
  sit A-levels in geography, economics and maths. “It is tough at times,” he
  admits. “Especially when people around you are going off to play golf and
  padel! But it’s just one more year of hard work and then I can focus on
  cricket.” Last winter he missed a chunk of schooling to tour South Africa with
  England’s under-19s and will do likewise early next year at a World Cup in
  Zimbabwe and Namibia. “I’ll keep in contact with the teachers,” he promises.
  At a World Cup? Of course you will. Rew chuckles. Having captained the squad
  against India this summer (in the ODI series only Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the
  14-year-old with an IPL century, outscored him), he will probably lead his
  country at that tournament. “I’ve enjoyed every single minute of it,” he says
  of captaincy. “It’s tough at times when keeping and having to run back and
  forth to the bowler. But there are enough people on the pitch to help you out
  if you’re ever struggling.” A query as to how he found surrendering both the
  gloves and leadership to James at Somerset earns another grin. “It’s felt
  weird being down at third and taking a back seat. But I’m always still
  thinking about how to impact the game.” Rew admits he offered James the odd
  post-match pointer, “but we try and leave the cricket chat to the pitch and
  just talk about other sports at home. We’re still massively competitive in
  everything we do.” The pair contest at padel, squash and golf. “There’s been a
  few strops on the golf course,” Rew says. “Good matches, but I’m definitely
  more liable [to throw a tantrum] … it’s happened on a few different courts. I
  think that’s just my competitive nature. I want to beat him at everything,
  which sometimes isn’t the case.” This summer Rew has made centuries for a
  counties select XI and for England Under-19s, debuted in both domestic
  white-ball competitions, and signed a Somerset contract that runs until 2027.
  A County Championship bow in September feels plausible and then, who knows.
