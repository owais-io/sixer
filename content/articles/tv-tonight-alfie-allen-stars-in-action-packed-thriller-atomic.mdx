  Atomic 10pm, Sky Atlantic Alfie Allen and Shazad Latif make a punchy pair in
  this action-packed crime series. Max (Allen) is a drug smuggler who meets
  enigmatic JJ (Latif) while on a job driving from north Africa to the Middle
  East, and they’re quickly swept up in all sorts of trouble. But what starts as
  a bid for survival – from violent extremist ambushes to the CIA and MI6
  closing in – soon becomes a tale of redemption. Hollie Richardson The Dog
  House 8pm, Channel 4 It’s the return of one of the most heart-tugging shows on
  telly. Spud the French bulldog (or Spuddy to his friends) is a big ball of
  energy; will he be too much for a young family? Elsewhere, cane corso cross
  Tinker has just been dropped off, but she refuses to move from the spot where
  her old owner left her. HR Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild 9pm, Channel 5 In
  an episode postponed from last week, we meet Rupert, who quit the UK to live a
  simpler existence as a rice farmer in the Japanese mountains. Ben Fogle visits
  his traditional house and delves into the reasons why Rupert left his old life
  behind in favour of one that sounds like rewarding, peaceful bliss. HR The
  Fortune Hotel 9pm, ITV1 “Welcome to Fort Matthew. Like me, it’s very old,
  crumbling in places, and was designed to repel the French.” In the penultimate
  challenge, Stephen Mangan locks one partner in a cell, while the other
  searches for matching symbols to find the key. But before that, the remaining
  teams must send daggers to their rivals – literally. Ali Catterall Dear Viv
  9pm, BBC Three The Vivienne was a firecracker queen on Drag Race and the
  winner of the first UK series. Fans and friends were shocked when they died
  earlier this year aged 32. Their life is shared and celebrated here by Baga
  Chipz, Cheryl and many more in Vivienne’s fabulous circle. HR First Dates
  10pm, Channel 4 What’s worse: a first date with no chat, or sitting across the
  table from someone so talkative you can’t get a word in? Both extremes are
  played out in Fred’s restaurant this week, as Wendy, 66, seeks romance from
  car salesman Gary, and Towie star Leah looks north for love with Steve, an
  ex-bouncer from Runcorn. Ellen E Jones Film choice The Thursday Murder Club
  (Chris Columbus, 2025), Netflix Richard Osman’s wildly popular series of
  mystery novels has, inevitably, reached our screens, with Chris Columbus
  taking on the first book. We’re very much in “cosy crime” country – no Glass
  Onion-style knowing winks here – with the action set in and around a
  well-heeled rural retirement home. Helen Mirren’s Elizabeth, who used to be in
  “international affairs”, is the prime mover of the titular cold case
  investigation group, which also includes former trade unionist Ron (Pierce
  Brosnan), psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley) and Celia Imrie’s nurse/cake
  obsessive Joyce. The murder of a co-owner of the home leads the quartet on a
  lightly comic, reliably twisty hunt for the killer. Simon Wardell
