  Good afternoon, readers. In an end to a protracted legal battle, Linda
  Reynolds has won her defamation case against her former staffer Brittany
  Higgins in the Western Australian supreme court. The state supreme court judge
  Paul Tottle ruled on Wednesday that the former defence minister’s reputation
  was damaged by social media posts published by Higgins in 2022 and July 2023.
  Higgins has been ordered to pay Reynolds $315,000 in damages with an
  additional $26,109.25 in interest. Tottle found Higgins had defamed Reynolds
  in an Instagram story on 4 July 2023, accusing her of mishandling her alleged
  rape and waging a campaign of harassment. However, Tottle found Higgins had
  successfully establish the defence of honest opinion, fair comment and
  qualified privilege against defamation allegations about another post accusing
  the former senator of “silencing” sexual assault victim-survivors. Porepunkah
