  Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to overturn a lower court decision
  that most of his sweeping trade tariffs were illegal. The US president filed a
  petition late on Wednesday to ask for a review of last week’s federal appeals
  court ruling in Washington DC, which centred on his “liberation day” border
  taxes introduced on 2 April, which imposed levies of between 10% and 50% on
  most US imports, sending shock waves through global trade and markets. The
  court found in a 7-4 ruling last Friday that Trump had overstepped his
  presidential powers when he invoked a 1977 law designed to address national
  emergencies to justify his “reciprocal” tariffs. The decision was the biggest
  blow yet to Trump’s tariff policies, but the levies were left in place until
  14 October – giving the administration time to ask the supreme court to review
  the decision. Trump has now appealed and the supreme court is expected to
  review the case, although the justices must still agree to do so. The
  administration asked for that decision to be made by 10 September. The appeal
  calls for an accelerated schedule with arguments being heard by 10 November,
  according to filings seen by Bloomberg. Justices could then rule by the end of
  the year. The ruling that the tariffs were unlawful upheld a previous decision
  by the US Court of International Trade. The federal appeals court said last
  Friday that US law “bestows significant authority on the president to
  undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency,
  but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs,
  duties, or the like, or the power to tax”. It said many of Trump’s steep
  tariffs were “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”, the ruling added, and
  “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the
  law his administration has leaned on. A defeat for Trump’s levies would at
  least halve the current average US effective tariff rate of 16.3%, and could
  force the country to pay back tens of billions of dollars, according to Chris
  Kennedy, an analyst at Bloomberg Economics. It could also derail the
  preliminary trade deals the president has struck with some countries,
  including the UK and the European Union. Tariffs typically need to be approved
  by Congress, but Trump claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading
  partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some
  circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit
  international transactions during a national emergency. Earlier this week, the
  US clothing brand Levi’s said that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence
  of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could drive British shoppers
  away from its denim. Other brands, such as Tesla, have also suffered in Europe
  and in Canada, while protests against US goods have led to a slump in sales of
  Jack Daniel’s whiskey.
