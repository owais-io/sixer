  The owner of Kingsmill has agreed to buy its rival Hovis in a deal worth an
  estimated £75m that could create the UK’s biggest bread brand if the
  competition regulator approves it, but also put jobs at risk. The deal comes
  after decades of decline in the popularity of the packaged sliced loaf, with
  Hovis, owned by the private equity company Endless, and its rival Kingsmill –
  part of Associated British Foods (ABF) – struggling to get out of the red for
  some years. ABF, which also owns the Primark clothing chain, said the tie-up
  would combine the production and distribution activities of the two
  businesses, which is expected to lead to roles being shed. It is understood
  that bringing together these facilities could save £55m. Sharon Graham, the
  general secretary of the Unite union, which represents hundreds of workers at
  both businesses, said: “While there is still a long way to go before any
  buyout happens, Hovis and Kingsmill must ensure that jobs are protected. Unite
  represents workers at both companies and we will not tolerate attacks on jobs,
  pay or conditions.” The potential merger between the UK’s second and third
  largest bread brands will attract scrutiny from the competition watchdog,
  which it is understood could take a year. The Competition and Markets
  Authority will have to decide if the brands face sufficient rivalry on price
  and quality from supermarket own labels and other options as well as the UK’s
  current market leader, Warburtons, which accounts for more than a quarter of
  packaged sliced bread sales. The Hovis directors said in accounts recently
  published at Companies House that they thought any deal was “unlikely to be
  concluded” before September next year and that scrutiny was likely to continue
  until at least then. Sales at Hovis, which employs 2,925 people, fell almost
  9% to £447m in the year to 28 September 2024 as pre-tax losses widened to
  £4.7m from a loss of £3.6m a year before after £530,000 in one-off costs, the
  majority of which related to restructuring. It said it had been battling
  “extreme price volatility across key raw materials” during the year.
  Meanwhile, ABF’s bakery division, Allied Bakeries – which includes Kingsmill,
  Allinson’s and Sunblest – incurs annual losses of about £30m despite sales of
  about £400m, according to analysts at Panmure Liberum. Both businesses are
  facing strong competition from the family-owned Warburtons, now the UK’s
  biggest bread brand, which has gained a bigger slice of the market through
  innovation – from giant crumpets to seeded flatbreads. It is understood to
  account for more than a quarter of packaged bread sold. Supermarkets’ own
  labels account for more than 40% of traditional wrapped sliced bread sales and
  Warburtons for just over a quarter at present, with the other two players
  together accounting for a similar amount. If other “morning goods” such as
  rolls, bagels and croissants, and different types of bread, are taken into
  account, the figures change again. The deal comes as the British ethanol
  industry, dominated by ABF, was plunged into a fresh crisis. The government
  confirmed it would not be proceeding with a rescue package despite ABF
  warnings that a deal agreed with Donald Trump in May posed an “existential
  threat”. Under the deal, the UK scrapped tariffs on a quota of 1.4bn litres of
  imports from the US, the exact size of the UK production. “We have worked
  closely with the companies since June to understand the financial challenges
  they have faced over the past decade, and have taken the difficult decision
  not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or
  solve the long-term problems the industry faces,” the Department for Business
  and Trade said on Friday. ABF said the decision was “deeply regrettable”,
  accusing the government of having “thrown away billions in potential growth in
  the Humber” and the opportunity to “lead the world” on clean fuels. “We have
  been fighting for months to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks
  with government in good faith. We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to
  profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the
  government’s own green industrial strategy.”
