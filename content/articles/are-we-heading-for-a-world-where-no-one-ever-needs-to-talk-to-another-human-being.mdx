  So we’re just playing dumb then, are we? Righto. An extremely confusing study
  of San Francisco’s transport services has found that not only are people
  completely on board with driverless taxis, they are also willing to pay 50%
  more and wait significantly longer for them. Whyever could this be, eh? Most
  of the mooted explanations have been largely practical – driverless taxis are
  proven to be safer (until the machines rise up as one and wipe out humanity).
  They can’t be over the limit, on their phone at the wheel or give in to road
  rage. And yes, these are technically valid reasons, but come on. The real
  answer, which no one is admitting, is that driverless taxis mean we don’t have
  to talk to anybody. It’s not surprising that many of us would happily put our
  lives in robot hands to dodge the horror of panic-asking a living, breathing
  cabbie if he has been busy tonight. We exist in a time when the majority of
  Britons would rather receive a text than a phone call. So many salons, all
  over the globe, now offer silent haircuts – where it’s pre-agreed there will
  be no chat – that they barely register as unusual any more. Self-service
  checkouts – the driverless taxi of the supermarket – are more labour
  intensive, more annoying, yet still exceptionally popular. Keeping stumm now
  seems to be our society’s raison d’etre. One of my friends painstakingly picks
  slivers of mushroom out of his favourite takeaway dish one by one because
  there is no option to remove them on the food delivery app. If he rang the
  restaurant to order it, he could ask them to exclude mushrooms, but he won’t
  consider it. A former colleague nearly had an embarrassing accident on a long
  flight because she didn’t want to ask the man in the next seat to let her out
  to use the loo, in case it opened a conversational channel between them. When
  she told this story in the office, everyone nodded sagely, accepting her
  decision as perfectly rational. It appears that some of us will go to just
  about any lengths to avoid talking to people. Several tactics can be used to
  deter your fellow man or woman from speaking to you. The classic is to pretend
  to be on the phone, but this can be perilous and requires you to know your
  angles. If the other party is afforded a glimpse of your screen, and has ever
  seen a phone before, they will immediately recognise your lock display and the
  jig will be up. The greater danger is that you get a phone call in the middle
  of your faux call, making it clear you were faking. A lower risk/lower reward
  strategy is wearing headphones, particularly if combined with an engrossed
  expression, but they can be removed quickly and easily so success can’t be
  guaranteed. Further methods include fast walking – you are in too much of a
  hurry to stop and chat – and looking sad/worried – you are in too much turmoil
  to stop and chat. However, there are times – glorious, effortless times – when
  there’s no need to plot and plan. The planets align and magic occurs –
  simultaneously, two people who do not want to talk act as if they haven’t seen
  each other. It doesn’t mean they don’t like one another, or that there isn’t
  respect or even admiration between them – they simply can’t be bothered right
  now because life is a lot. This mutual ghosting isn’t arranged, but unspoken,
  instinctive, written in the stars. In the best cases, it is almost
  choreographed, as the two move around, giving the widest berth possible
  without making it conspicuous, lost in thought, simply not noticing anything
  or anybody, honest guv. The bond between these souls is precious, sacred, but
  fragile. If it snaps, if one person messes up and accidentally catches the
  other’s eye, they will both have to endure an excruciating performance: “Oh,
  my goodness – I didn’t see you there! What a surprise! Hello!” Examples of
  this tense tango can be witnessed at bus stops and train platforms all over
  the country, especially during the morning or evening commute. You have to
  look out for them closely, though –but don’t do that, obviously, because then
  you might see someone you know and have to speak to them.
