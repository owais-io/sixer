  Lil Nas X has been arrested and briefly hospitalized after an altercation with
  police in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to authorities in Los
  Angeles. Officers found the 26-year-old rapper and singer walking on the
  normally busy Ventura Boulevard in the Studio City neighborhood shortly before
  6am, according to a police spokesperson, Charles Miller. TMZ obtained video
  footage of the incident that appears to show Lil Nas X wearing only underwear
  and cowboy boots and claiming he was going to a party. The two-time Grammy
  winner, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, was later booked on suspicion
  of misdemeanour battery after he was confronted by officers and charged at
  them, Miller said in a statement reported by the Associated Press. Officers
  took the rapper to a hospital first because they suspected a drug overdose,
  Miller said. There was no further word on his condition, but he was released
  from the hospital and taken to jail after just a few hours. He has since been
  booked on suspicion of misdemeanour for obstructing an officer and was being
  held at Valley jail in Van Nuys, near where the police found him. Lil Nas X
  gained fame after his track Old Town Road became a record-breaking No 1 hit,
  staying there for 19 weeks. He also had success with songs including Industry
  Baby and Montero (Call Me By Your Name). He is set to release his album
  Dreamboy later this year after releasing a number of singles this spring, and
  in the last week, returned to social media with a series of posts featuring
  snippets of new music. He also changed his Instagram name to Queen Madeleine
  and shared images of himself in a variety of costumes with the furniture in
  his apartment being rearranged. In April, he was hospitalised after
  experiencing sudden facial paralysis. In a video shared to Instagram, he said
  he “lost control” of half his face. The Guardian has reached out to his
  representatives for comment.
