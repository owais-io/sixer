  Good morning. Donald Trump has piled pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, before talks in Washington on Monday, saying the leader
  could end the war “almost immediately” if he wanted to. The president’s
  comments were posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday night, hours
  before he was due to meet Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, Finland,
  France, Germany, Italy, the EU and Nato at the Oval Office. After his meeting
  with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, on Friday, Trump also ruled out
  Ukraine joining Nato or recovering Russian-occupied Crimea. He posted on
  Sunday: “President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost
  immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. No getting back
  Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and no going
  into Nato by Ukraine. Some things never change!!!” Will it be one meeting or
  more? Two – Trump will first meet Zelenskyy at 1.15pm EDT in the Oval Office,
  before a summit with the European leaders at 3pm, the White House said. Tens
  of thousands of protesters gather in Tel Aviv to demand end to Gaza war Tens
  of thousands of demonstrators joined a protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday evening
  to demand an end to Israel’s war in Gaza and the release of hostages. It is
  one of the largest demonstrations in Israel since the war began in October
  2023, coming on a day of nationwide protests and a general strike to put
  pressure on the government to end the conflict. While police did not confirm
  the figure, the demonstration’s organizer, the Hostage and Missing Families
  Forum, claimed that about 500,000 people took part. What is the latest from
  Gaza? Fear is spreading among Palestinians after the Israeli military said it
  was preparing to forcibly displace 1 million people from Gaza City. Judge
  restrains Beto O’Rourke’s group from sending funds to Democrats outside Texas
  A Texas judge has barred former congressman Beto O’Rourke and his political
  organization from sending money out of the state after it fundraised for
  Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a session on
  congressional redistricting. Conservative Tarrant county judge Megan Fahey
  said that financial institutions and political fundraising platforms,
  including ActBlue, the main online platform for Democrats, are “immediately
  restrained from removing any property or funds that belong to, or are being
  held for,” O’Rourke or Powered by People “from the state of Texas.” Many Texas
  Democrats have been in Chicago since early August, each racking up fines of
  $500 a day for missing a session called by the Republican Texas governor, Greg
  Abbott, that would probably give Republicans five seats after next year’s
  midterm elections. O’Rourke said “more than 55,000 donations” had come in
  since their walk-out. How else are Democrats resisting the Texas plan?
  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, last week revealed a plan last week to
  redraw his state’s map to potentially add five safe Democratic seats in
  Congress – but will only go ahead if Texas does. In other news … An angler on
  the Mississippi River in Minnesota has helped solve a nearly 60-year-old
  missing person case after he spotted a submerged vehicle, according to the
  authorities and local news. Democrat-run cities are preparing their response
  in case the Trump administration decides to stage a takeover and send in the
  national guard as it has done in Washington DC. Two rightwing candidates will
  compete for the Bolivian presidency in a runoff race, after the leftist party
  was excluded following nearly two decades in power. Stat of the day: English
  councils have left a third of the budget to house Ukrainian refugees unspent
  Despite thousands of Ukrainian refugees facing homelessness in England, £327m
  (about $443m) of the funding given to councils to help them into housing has
  not been spent – about a third of the total budget. Three years after Russia’s
  full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian refugees were more than twice as
  likely as British people to experience homelessness. Don’t miss this: How Kate
  Price uncovered the horrifying truths of her childhood For as long as she can
  remember, Kate Price was sexually abused by her father. This only ended when
  he left the family, when she was 12, and as an adult, she discovered that he
  had also drugged her and sold her to other men. Five decades on, Price, who is
  now an academic who researches the commercial sexual exploitation of children,
  has published her memoir, This Happened To Me, which at times reads like a
  detective story as she pieces together what was done to her – and the process
  of healing. Climate check: How the sea is swallowing coastal villages in the
  Philippines Residents of Hagonoy, a municipality on Luzon, the Philippines’
  largest and most populous island, are seeing their homes and streets flooded
  more often as global heating causes sea levels to rise. Photographer Ezra
  Acayan depicts the impact on families’ daily lives in this powerful series.
  Last Thing: ‘Skibidi’ and ‘delulu’’ among words added to Cambridge Dictionary
  In a bizarre sign of their staying power, the latest terms from the TikTok
  lexicon to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary include “skibidi” and
  “delulu”. While the latter may be easier to parse, “skibidi” is less a
  definable word than a vibe. The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as “a word
  that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with
  no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: ‘What the skibidi are
  you doing?’” Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every
