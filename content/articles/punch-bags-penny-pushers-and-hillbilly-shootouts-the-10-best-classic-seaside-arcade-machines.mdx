  The seaside day trip remains an almost essential component of the school
  summer holidays, and although the big beachfront arcades have changed a lot
  over the last decade, they are still a magnet for small kids with handfuls of
  change, as well as adults hoping to spy an old Space Invaders cabinet in the
  back. As a child of the 1980s, coin-op video games were an obsession, but what
  really fascinated me were the older machines, the electro-mechanical oddities
  that hung on into the digital age. Here are 10 of the best – please add your
  own in the comments. Electro-mechanical driving games Long before the arrival
  of computer chips and CRT monitors, arcade driving games featured projected
  images of landscapes or even scrolling paintings to give the impression of
  hurtling along a road. The first examples arrived in the 1930s and a few later
  models, such as Chicago Coin’s Speedway and Sega’s Grand Prix stuck around in
  seaside arcades well into the 1980s. I remember playing a later example,
  Kasco’s astonishing 1979 arcade game The Driver, on the pier at Blackpool. It
  used 16mm footage of a real race to put you right in the action. Air hockey
  There was a time when the rapid-fire noise of plastic pucks rebounding around
  large snooker-like tables was a constant soundtrack in larger arcades. Air
  Hockey was invented by US company Brunswick Billiards in 1969 and it quickly
  caught on across the globe offering a fast-paced alternative to pool and table
  football. You can still find them in retro arcades, especially in traditional
  seaside towns such as Great Yarmouth, Blackpool and Southend. Derby games
  These large installations feature tin horses lining up on a race track – six
  to eight players each sit at a cabinet in front of the course and throw balls
  at a target in order to move their equine racer toward the finishing line: the
  most accurate player wins. It seems the original version of the game, Kentucky
  Derby, was brought to Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the 1920s by George
  Valentine Tonner, an Irish-American soldier, jockey and amusement park
  concessionaire who also patented an early version of dodgems. Later examples
  swap horses for donkeys or camels, while a smaller variant, The Derby by
  Whittaker Bros, invited multiple players to bet on the outcome of automated
  horse races for a modest payback. Egg vending machines Toy vending machines
  followed gumball machines into American stores, cafes and station platforms in
  the 1930s, but it was in 1965 that the first gachapon machine was installed in
  a shop in Tokyo by entrepreneur Ryuzo Shigeta. These dispensed their wares in
  cute little plastic capsules, and the idea caught on. More commonly known as
  egg machines in the UK, most 1980s seaside arcades would have a couple outside
  the entrance, the most famous examples being Glendale’s Oranges and Lemons and
  Lucky Eggs machines, the later of which would dispense your prize from a
  rotating, clucking hen – which made it that much more special. Basketball
  hoops You’d get rows of these large machines, often at the back of the arcade,
  giving players a number of chances to lob a basketball through a hoop, usually
  within a caged play area so you didn’t accidentally launch the ball across the
  room. Classics such as Hoop Shot, Triple Jam and Full Court Fever added
  features including moving hoops and connected play so you could compete
  against pals on nearby machines. This was always where the rowdy teens hung
  out. Fortune telling machines Originating in the late 19th century these
  arcade and boardwalk amusements usually feature animated automatons, often
  stereotypical representations of Gypsies, witches or ancient Middle Eastern
  royalty. Put in a coin and the mystic character gestures, breathes and speaks
  your fortune (or deposits a card with your fortune written on it), accompanied
  by special effects such as a glowing crystal ball. Notable examples include
  Madame Zita, the creepy 1977 innovation Morgana, whose face is a video
  projection on to a featureless foam head, and Zoltar, which inspired the 1988
  movie Big. Other automaton machines feature dancing puppets and absolutely
  terrifying laughing clowns. Punch ball Beloved of young men keen to prove
  their masculinity, these have been around since at least 190o when the
  Chicago-based Mills Novelty Co released its Punching Bag model, complete with
  ornate oak stand. Modern versions have digital displays featuring accurate
  strength read-outs, but you’re still just hitting a ball as hard as you can.
  Other strength testing machines include the Mr Muscle machine from Italian
  manufacturer Zamperla, which challenged you to arm wrestle with an
  intimidating plastic man. Crane grabber Also known as claw machines, these
  remain a staple arcade experience. You slot in a coin and use the joystick to
  direct an ineffectual grabber towards your desired toy. Usually, it makes a
  pathetic attempt before dropping the item millimetres away from the delivery
  chute (mostly because the claws can be set to only grip at full strength for a
  minority of attempts). The first commercial example is thought to be the Erie
  Digger manufactured in the US through the 1920s but since then well-known
  arcade manufacturers such as Sega and Bally have created their own examples,
  the former revolutionising the market in the 1980s with its UFO Catcher
  machines offering larger prizes and a brighter kawaii look. They remain
  irresistible. Light gun shooting galleries Light gun shooting galleries were
  in every arcade in the 70s and 80s, but my favourite examples were the large
  installations featuring lifesize scenes to shoot at, often with a wild west,
  pirate or gangster theme. The one I most remember playing – I think in
  Blackpool’s Coral Island arcade – was called Hillybilly Moonshine and it had
  several mannequins dressed in overalls as well as a big copper distiller and
  various barrels and critters. If you hit the hillbillies they fired water
  pistols at you. You can still find these dotted about in surviving coin-op
  houses and they’re really worth a go. Coin pusher Invented by Ramsgate-based
  manufacturing firm Cromptons in 1966 (though there were earlier variants),
  coin push games are the kings of the seaside arcade, dominating the floor
  space and enticing players with their piles of sparkling treasure surely ready
  to fall at any second. The original was called Penny Falls, but there are
  hundreds of variations now, including virtual coin pushers, which move the
  action on to a screen with lots of special effects. Oh, the hours I spent
  during summer holidays wandering the arcades of Blackpool and Morecambe, a
  plastic cup of 2p coins in my hand, scrutinising these seductive machines.
  “Penny pushers are absolutely pivotal to the success of the British amusement
  arcade,” says lecturer and historian Alan Meades, author of Arcade Britannia:
  A Social History of the British Amusement Arcade. “Alongside the fruit machine
  they are where the arcades made their money – penny pushers could last for
  decades – retooled with currency changes – and recouped their costs time and
  again.”
