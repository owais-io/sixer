  A FAMILIAR OPTIMISM When the white smoke billowed from the Ibrox chimney in
  June and Russell Martin was revealed as the new manager of Rangers, vast
  swathes of the club’s fans could scarcely have been more unenthusiastic.
  Indeed, short of announcing that Pope Leo XV had left his new role at the
  Vatican and would be taking over after Barry Ferguson’s lengthy spell in
  caretaker charge, it is difficult to imagine any other appointment prompting
  more fury. “We’re not oblivious to the noise at all,” harrumphed the Rangers
  CEO, Patrick Stewart, upon being quizzed about fan reaction to his
  announcement. “But I think we are confident because we’ve embarked on such a
  thorough process to take us to this point where we’ve appointed Russell that
  we’re confident supporters will get behind him.” Having paddled into Ibrox on
  such a tidal wave of antipathy, it seemed imperative that Martin got off to a
  good start and the man who masterminded just one win in Southampton’s opening
  16 Premier League games last season before being booted towards the Saints
  door marked ‘Do one!’ has done exactly that. In closing out their aggregate
  win in a Bigger Cup second qualifying round against Panathinaikos, Russell’s
  Rangers have successfully negotiated the first hurdle of the season and now
  face Czech side Viktoria Plzen as they aim to reach the Bigger Cup league
  phase. But at the very least, last night’s draw in Greece means a place in
  Euro Vase is now guaranteed. “I’ve just said to the players in the dressing
  room, I’m so proud of them,” said Martin, after new signing Djeidi Gassama
  struck back to restore parity after Panathinaikos had opened the scoring. “To
  be five weeks into the process, from where they were to where they are is
  incredible.” With European football now guaranteed until January and the
  possibility of Bigger Cup group stage participation still very much alive,
  Martin has presumably bought himself some time from his many vocal detractors
  among the Rangers fanbase but now is no time for complacency. With the fitba
  league season due to start this weekend and his players fresh from walking
  their hand luggage out from the back of their plane from Athens, they will
  have to prove they can do it on wet and windy nights (or as they are known in
  Scotland: ‘nights’ ) in places like Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Paisley if they
  are to mount any sort of meaningful title challenge against Celtic. It was at
  exactly such places that Rangers came a cropper last season, leading to the
  17-point chasm that separated the two Glasgow clubs at the end of the
  campaign. While Martin may have earned some grudging goodwill from the Ibrox
  faithful for his early efforts thus far, expect it to evaporate if his
  new-look side fail to win Saturday’s league opener at Motherwell and hand the
  advantage, if not the title to Celtic before Brendan Rodgers’ side have even
  played a game. QUOTE OF THE DAY “Since the first day of this investigation, I
  have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations. I
  can’t say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful
  I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on
  my face. To my wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham United, to the
  fans who always cheered me on, and to my family, friends and the legal team
  who have supported me – thank you for everything” – Lucas Paquetá has been
  cleared of spot-fixing. The West Ham midfielder was charged by the FA last
  year with four counts of deliberately getting himself booked to influence
  betting markets so that friends and family members might benefit and faced a
  lengthy ban if found guilty. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS I was going to be
  stereotypically Smoggie about Granit Xhaka moving to Sunderland (yesterday’s
  Football Daily letters), a city so urbane and sophisticated that the National
  Glass Centre closed down a year or two back, but considering the problems
  Newcastle seem to be having attracting players to the region, I feel I should
  thank Mr Xhaka for moving to the north east. The region is beautiful, with a
  ruggedly handsome coastline and pretty villages that would make those more
  famous ones down south look like the back end of Reading. I hope, off the back
  of this signing, we see more players moving to God’s Own Former Mining
  Country. Sancho and Grealish to Middlesbrough next, please” – (Not that)
  Andrew Tate. I was interested to read Jim Hearson, regarding the blind trust
  set up by Evangelos Marinakis (yesterday’s letters). Is that the same blind
  trust that Granit Xhaka is displaying by being convinced to sign for
  Sunderland?” – Paul Taverner. As an exiled Exile, living far from Newport (and
  the UK), it was nice to see a rare mention of County in yesterday’s Football
  Daily (full email edition). Even nicer to see the picture of the second kit.
  While not remotely amusing, there is a very interesting story about why this
  kit looks like Athletic Club’s kit, and indeed why it’s flying off the shelves
  in (parts of) the Basque Country” – Dave Lloyd. If you have any, please send
  letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’
  the day is … Dave Lloyd. Terms and conditions for our competitions, when we
  run them, are here.  This is an extract from our daily football email …
