  Loneliness has been a constant feature of Macyleen’s life since she was nine
  years old and her mother died in their home town in Zimbabwe. She was sent to
  live with her father, but he worked away from home a lot. His new wife
  resented his other children and was emotionally abusive. Macyleen lived with
  three half-siblings, but they were much older. “We were there to survive and
  just get to the next day. I knew I was alone,” she recalls. That feeling has
  never really left Macyleen, who is now 33, building a childminding business
  and bringing up four children on her own in Gqeberha (formerly Port
  Elizabeth), South Africa. There are many people in Africa experiencing
  loneliness, like Macyleen. According to a report in June by the World Health
  Organization, Africa is the loneliest continent on Earth. Almost a quarter
  (24%) of people there reported feeling lonely, and adolescents aged 13 to 17
  are the worst affected, the WHO says. The next highest rates of loneliness are
  in the eastern Mediterranean (21%), followed by south-east Asia (18%). Europe
  has the lowest rate, at about 10%. The report comes after the WHO declared
  loneliness a pressing “global public health concern” and launched an
  international commission on social connection to examine the problem. Africa
  is traditionally viewed as having a collectivist culture that prioritises the
  needs and goals of the group as a whole over individuals. But this is
  changing. Dr Cleopa Mailu, a member of the commission and a former Kenyan
  health minister, says: “My initial reaction [to the findings] was one of
  rejection. “I live in Africa and tend to think the society we are today is the
  one of the 1950s or 60s, and that there’s more loneliness in the western
  hemisphere. I came to realise that feeling I had was just an internalisation
  of our past.” Loneliness is not recognised as a problem in Africa, says Mailu,
  and people do not want to discuss it. Instead, social wellbeing has been
  neglected in health policies in favour of focusing on communicable and
  non-communicable diseases. Meanwhile, cities on the continent are rapidly
  expanding; over the next three decades, Africa’s urban population will double,
  increasing from 700 million to 1.4 billion by 2050. “We never came alive to
  the fact that we have been globalising ourselves – living in conditions which
  are not traditional to the African people,” adds Mailu. “In a way, we rejected
  the notion that there’s loneliness and isolation in the continent.” Mailu
  attributes higher levels of loneliness to a changing society, and growing
  urbanisation and globalisation, as well as new governance structures,
  migration, poverty and changing views of wealth and success. “In traditional
  settings, wealth was defined differently,” says Mailu. “You just needed to
  have a cow and a farm or somewhere to cultivate. Everybody was the same level.
  “Now there are different levels of poverty,” he says. “There is a lot of
  pressure and you find people are not together.” Macyleen can identify with
  this. She says the Africa she grew up in is very different from the one she
  lives in today. People are copying western culture, she says: “It’s all about
  me or my immediate people. Maybe that’s one of the reasons people are becoming
  more selfish.” Macyleen finds it hard to open up to people, fearing judgment
  over being a single mother to children with different fathers, all of whom
  abandoned her. She also has little opportunity to socialise, given that she is
  trying to build her own business and bring up four children with no financial
  help. “I struggle with stress and things are getting hard in South Africa.
  There’s a lot of xenophobia and I have this heavy feeling that I don’t belong
  here any more,” she says. “If something happens, I have to be the mother and
  the father [to my children]. It gets really lonely, especially because I’m
  scared of dating. Who can I find to trust? “The world is changing so fast,”
  she adds. “And there’s too much pressure to do well, but we are in an
  environment that is not helping us.” Lateefat Odunuga, a psychologist and
  global adviser for the African Network of Youth Policy Experts, agrees that
  Africa is changing from a continent with many people in close-knit communities
  to one where that traditional way of life is being erased by urbanisation. She
  says loneliness is a pressing issue for young people across the continent.
  “Young people are frustrated,” she says. “There’s a lot of unemployment, drug
  abuse, mental health issues. We’re seeing a lot of young people dying [by]
  suicide.” The increased cost of living, she adds, means people would rather
  stay at home than spend money on cultural events, for example. She blames
  technology for contributing to the problem. More people are using apps such as
  TikTok for entertainment and, through her practice in Nigeria, she has heard
  of individuals turning to ChatGPT to check if they are depressed, instead of
  talking to a family member, for example. While loneliness might not be
  recognised on a widespread basis in Africa, there are organisations dedicated
  to tackling it, she says. She cites Friendship Bench, an approach first
  developed in Zimbabwe that trains community health workers to provide basic
  cognitive behavioural therapy with an emphasis on activity scheduling and
  group support. The model has been replicated in countries throughout the
  world. The WHO report highlighted the AgeWell peer-to-peer support programme
  in Cape Town. Older volunteers were trained to provide friendship and company
  to less able older residents in their community through regular home visits.
  South African participants reported less loneliness, and there was a
  significant increase in social participation. “Depending on how committed we
  are to this work,” says Odunuga, “there might be a future for us to tackle
  social isolation and loneliness. “But if we don’t bring people together,” she
  warns, “we are doomed. We’re going to have a lot of problems beyond mental
  health. It will be a disaster and a total shame to humanity.” In the UK and
  Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing
  jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide
  Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support
  service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at
