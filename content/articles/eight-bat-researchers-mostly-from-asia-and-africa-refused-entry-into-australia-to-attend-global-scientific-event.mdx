  Organisers of an international research conference have criticised a
  last-minute Australian government decision to deny visas to eight invited
  researchers, mostly from Asia and Africa. Prof Justin Welbergen, chair of the
  20th International Bat Research Conference in Cairns, said the decision to
  deny the researchers entry without option to appeal had disrupted the event,
  which is a key forum for global collaboration on bat research and
  conservation. He said the eight researchers from Kenya, Uganda, India,
  Pakistan and Georgia were “recognised contributors to the global field of bat
  research and conservation”. Among them is a well-renowned bat researcher who
  did his PhD in Australia. The refusals came amid reports in the AFR that the
  immigration minister, Tony Burke, had denied dozens of visas on the basis of
  social cohesion. When asked why the delegates’ visas were denied, a
  spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said it could not comment on
  individual cases for privacy reasons. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “All
  non-citizens applying for visas to enter Australia are considered on an
  individual basis and against legal requirements set out in Australia’s
  migration legislation,” the spokesperson said. “This includes requirements
  that all applicants undertake and meet (where relevant) health, character and
  security checks.” The International Bat Research Conference dates back to 1968
  and is held once every three years. The last time Australia hosted the event
  was Sydney in 1989. About 500 delegates from research institutions,
  governments, industry and conservation organisations from 59 countries were
  attending the week-long conference, held on 3–8 August in Queensland. On
  Thursday, a letter to Burke from the organising committee was gathering
  support and signatures from almost 150 delegates. The letter expressed the
  committee’s “deep concern and disappointment” about the decisions to deny the
  visas, which it said risked damaging Australia’s reputation as a hub for
  international exchange in science. “Scientific progress depends on the open
  exchange of knowledge across borders, including in areas such as zoonotic
  disease surveillance, biodiversity conservation and ecological sustainability
  – all topics with direct relevance to Australia’s own interests,” the letter
  said. “We stand in solidarity with our valued colleagues who were denied
  entry, and we request the government takes immediate steps to rectify these
  actions in future proceedings.”
