  A manhunt is under way for Dezi Freeman, a 56-year-old so-called “sovereign
  citizen” accused of killing two police officers and injuring another in the
  Victorian town of Porepunkah, which is home to about 1,000 people. Here’s what
  we know so far About 10.30am on Tuesday, 10 police were attending a rural
  property in Porepunkah to execute a search warrant, relating to a matter that
  had been investigated by Victoria police’s sexual offences and child abuse
  investigation teams, when they were fired upon. Two officers were killed and
  another was wounded. The officers killed were detective leading senior
  constable Neal Thompson, 59, and senior constable Vadim De Waart, 35.
  Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined Victoria police in 1987
  and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood police station before
  working as a detective at the major fraud squad and the state crime squad. De
  Waart had only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the shooting occurred. He
  started his policing career at the Victoria police academy in late 2018 and
  worked for three years at St Kilda police station before joining the public
  order response team as a senior constable in April 2023. The police officer
  who was wounded has had surgery. On Thursday morning he remained in a stable
  condition at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, a hospital spokesperson
  confirmed. According to the chief commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush,
  the officers were “met by the offender, and they were murdered in cold blood”.
  On Wednesday, Bush named the suspect as 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, or Desmond
  Filby, whom he described as “heavily armed” and said he “understands bushcraft
  well”. He said Freeman had been able to run into the bush near the property
  alone immediately after the shooting. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Bush
  said it was believed Freeman was armed with multiple firearms, including long
  arms. He said police were still examining the scene to understand whether he
  took any additional weapons from police. The area around the town, about 300km
  north-east of Melbourne, is steep and mountainous. On Wednesday afternoon
  police released a new image of Freeman and a description of him as Caucasian,
  183cm tall, with medium build, short dark hair and brown eyes. Police said he
  was last seen wearing “dark green (khaki) tracksuit pants, dark green rain
  jacket, brown Blundstone boots and reading glasses”. Freeman has a history of
  association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. Bush would not
  confirm this but said he was known to police before the shooting. A former
  neighbour said Freeman used to spy on her family with drones. Police arrested
  a 42-year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy after detectives and special
  operations police raided a property in Porepunkah about 8.40pm Thursday night.
  The pair were taken into custody, interviewed and released, police said on
  Friday, confirming that their arrests formed part of the ongoing investigation
  into the deaths of the police officers. At a press conference later Friday,
  Bush confirmed the woman arrested was the suspect’s wife, who was interviewed
  and released pending further inquiries. “People were interviewed totally and
  specifically in relation to the homicide investigation. Those searches have
  been completed. The interviews have been conducted. Those people have been
  released. There may or may not be charges that follow,” Bush said. How has the
  search for Dezi Freeman unfolded? Police have deployed hundreds of specialist
  resources, including air and ground, to find him. On Tuesday Bush described
  the suspect’s address as a semi-rural property with a bus on site, which
  housed the alleged offender, his partner and children. Bush described the
  search area as “very wide”, with Freeman likely to “know that area better than
  us”. He said there had been no sightings of him since he fled into the bush on
  Tuesday. The Police Association Victoria chief executive, Wayne Gatt, said
  “hundreds of our members” were continuing to “put themselves in danger right
  as we speak” in an attempt to apprehend the suspect. The Victorian premier,
  Jacinta Allan, said Wednesday evening there were “huge resources” being put on
  the ground in North East Victoria. New South Wales police have also offered
  support. On Thursday afternoon, the Australian federal police confirmed it was
  providing assistance to the Porepunkah operation at the request of Victoria
  police. Guardian Australia understands that officers from the tactical
  response team have been deployed. The state’s police minister, Anthony
  Carbines, on Thursday said Bush had not requested additional financial
  support, while interstate police had provided technical and specialised
  assistance. He said the force was throwing “everything” at the search and the
  government had pledged “anything” it needs. Deputy commissioner regional
  operations, Russell Barrett, on Thursday said “every available asset” was
  being put into the manhunt. “We will not rest until we apprehend the
  offender,” he said. Barrett described the search as “protracted” owing to the
  “difficult terrain” police were navigating. Victoria police on Thursday said
  “severe weather” had complicated travel in the region. The Bureau of
  Meteorology forecast that a cold weather system could dump large amounts of
  snow – up to half a metre – over the Alpine mountains near the Victoria-NSW
  border. Bush said the team who went to Freeman’s property was made up of local
  officers and members of the sexual offences and child abuse team: “It’s a
  large area, so it required a large number of staff to search the area and also
  search for technology.” It was not a “hostage situation”, Bush said, as
  Freeman’s partner and children had attended a police station on Tuesday
  evening. He said police had spoken with Freeman’s partner. On Thursday,
  superintendent Brett Kahan addressed Freeman directly during a press
  conference, saying: “If Dezi Freeman is watching this, ring triple zero, and
  we will support a surrender plan.” The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on
  Friday morning said federal authorities would offer Victoria “every support
  that is required” to assist in the search for Freeman and confirmed the
  Australian federal police’s elite tactical unit had joined the operation. How
  has the Porepunkah community been affected? Kahan said on Thursday the
  Porepunkah community did not need to stay indoors but should remain vigilant.
  Police searches have been carried out on local properties, police said on
  Thursday. Barrett warned that anyone harbouring Freeman was committing a
  criminal offence. The local council closed all facilities “effective
  immediately”, and Porepunkah primary school was in lockdown for a period on
  Tuesday. The school reopened on Thursday morning. On Thursday, police advised
  members of the public, particularly those heading to nearby ski resorts, to
  avoid Porepunkah. What has the wider reaction been? Allan said the thoughts of
  “all Victorians” were with the police, saying the response showed first
  responders’ “extraordinary bravery and courage”. Albanese, said his thoughts
  were with the “police for the work they do, each and every day”. He said “the
  men and women who wear the uniform of the police take risks” for everyone. On
  Friday the PM added that “we want [Freeman] caught and we want people who are
  traumatised in that north-east community of Victoria to feel safe again”. In
  parliament on Thursday, the PM was joined by the leader of the opposition,
  Sussan Ley, and the member for Indi, Helen Haines, in paying tribute to the
  victims before a moment’s silence in their honour. The mayor of Alpine shire,
  Sarah Nicholas, said in a video message that Tuesday had been a day of “deep
  sorrow and shock” for the community: “We extend our heartfelt condolences to
  the families, friends and colleagues of the two police officers tragically
  killed in Porepunkah. Our thoughts, love and unwavering support are with you
  during this incredibly painful time.” The Victorian government has offered
  support to the local council and the Porepunkah primary school, including
  trauma counselling for any students, staff and affected families. • In
