  Nearly nine out of 10 Israeli military investigations into allegations of war
  crimes or abuses by its soldiers since the start of the war in Gaza have been
  closed without finding fault or left without resolution, according to a
  conflict monitor. Unresolved investigations include the killing of at least
  112 Palestinians queueing for flour in Gaza City in February 2024, Action on
  Armed Violence (AOAV) said, and an airstrike that killed 45 in an inferno at a
  tented camp in Rafah in May 2024. Also unresolved is an inquiry into the
  killing of 31 Palestinians going to pick up food at a distribution point in
  Rafah on 1 June. They were killed after Israeli forces opened fire, witnesses
  said. Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reports were
  “false” but the IDF told the Guardian that the incident was “still under
  review”. Iain Overton and Lucas Tsantzouris, the team at AOAV, said the
  statistics suggested Israel was seeking to create a “pattern of impunity” by
  failing to conclude or find no fault in the vast majority of cases involving
  “the most severe or public accusations of wrongdoing by their forces”. The IDF
  said it “conducts examination and investigation processes regarding
  exceptional incidents that occurred during operational activity, in which
  there is a suspicion of a violation of the law” in accordance with its
  obligations under Israeli and international law. It operates internal systems
  to conduct examinations and allegations of war crimes, including criminal
  investigations by the military advocate general’s police department and
  fact-finding assessments (FFA) by a separate team in the general staff. The
  relatively short passage of time, in investigatory and legal terms, means
  other unresolved cases may also result in prosecutions, though the two
  researchers said IDF inquiries had become “more opaque and slow-moving” as the
  number of civilian casualties in Gaza has mounted. AOAV said it had found
  reports of 52 cases in English-language media where the Israeli military said
  it had conducted or would conduct an investigation after allegations of
  civilian harm or wrongdoing by its forces in Gaza or the West Bank between
  October 2023 and the end of June 2025. They involve the deaths of 1,303
  Palestinians and the wounding of 1,880. One case resulted in a prison sentence
  for an Israeli soldier. An IDF reservist received a seven-month jail term in
  February after he was convicted by a military court of the aggravated abuse of
  Palestinian security detainees. He had repeatedly attacked bound and
  blindfolded prisoners with his fists, a baton and his assault rifle at the Sde
  Teiman detention centre. Five other cases ended with violations found. In one,
  an IDF colonel and a major were sacked in April 2024 and three other
  commanders reprimanded a few days after seven aid workers from the World
  Central Kitchen were killed in an airstrike. The IDF said it was a “grave
  mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification”,
  though the charity said the rapid investigation lacked credibility. The
  remaining 46 cases, representing 88% of the total, seven were closed without
  any finding of fault, AOAV said. A further 39 remain under review or with no
  outcome reported, including four deadly incidents over the course of last
  month when Palestinians were killed near or at various food distribution
  points on the Gaza Strip. According to the IDF: “Any report … complaint or
  allegation that suggests misconduct by IDF forces undergoes an initial
  examination process, irrespective of its source.” In some instances the
  evidence is such that a criminal investigation by military police is ordered,
  while in others an initial investigation takes place. These are referred to
  the IDF general staff’s FFA mechanism to determine “whether there is a
  reasonable suspicion of criminal misconduct”. Critics of the system, such as
  the Yesh Din human rights group, say FFA investigations can take years and
  have led to one known prosecution after 664 inquiries relating to previous IDF
  military operations in Gaza, in 2014, 2018-19 and 2021. In August 2024, the
  IDF said the FFA had collected information on “hundreds of incidents” relating
  to the war in Gaza alone, while the military advocate general’s office had
  launched 74 criminal investigations. Of these, 52 related to the deaths and
  mistreatment of detainees and 13 to the stealing of enemy ammunition, while a
  minority related to allegations of war crimes in combat situations. Three
  related to the “destruction of civilian property without military necessity”
  and six concerning “alleged illegal use of force”. The IDF statistics differ
  from the investigations tracked by AOAV because the research group used a
  different methodology. AOAV reviewed episodes where there were reports of an
  investigation being or having been conducted and also took in incidents on the
  West Bank as well as Gaza. The IDF said that “dozens of military police
  investigations have been opened” and that “most of these investigations are
  still ongoing”. The FFA mechanism, meanwhile, had “completed its review in
  dozens of cases” and these had transferred to the military advocate general
  for possible criminal investigation. • The headline of this article was
  amended on 4 August 2025 to clarify that 88% of cases of alleged war crimes or
  abuse have either been closed without charges or left unresolved.
