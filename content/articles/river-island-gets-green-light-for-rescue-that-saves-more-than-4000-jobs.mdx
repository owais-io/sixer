  River Island has got the green light for a rescue restructure that saves more
  than 4,000 jobs but will shut 33 of the clothing chain’s 230 stores as people
  shift to buying online. The plan to reduce costs, which still puts more than
  1,000 jobs and a further 70 sites at risk, won approval from a high court
  judge on Friday after a majority of creditors gave their backing earlier in
  the week. There had been fears the family-owned company could collapse after
  it told creditors in June that if a restructure was not approved it could run
  short of cash by the end of August and would be “unable to pay its debts as
  they fall due”. Ben Lewis, the retailer’s chief executive, said the approved
  plan, which involves a sharp reduction in rent payments, would enable the
  company to “align our store estate to our customers’ needs. He said: “We are
  pleased that River Island’s restructuring plan has been approved by the high
  court. “We have a clear transformation strategy to ensure the long-term
  viability of the business, and this decision gives us a strong platform to
  deliver this. Recent improvements in our fashion offer and shopping experience
  are starting to show results, and the restructuring plan will enable us to
  align our store estate to our customers’ needs.” There had been a question
  mark over whether the court would approve the deal as fewer than 75% of
  landlords, one class of creditors, did not back the plan in the online vote
  this week. The decision protects the future of a high street fashion stalwart
  that has outlived rivals from Topshop to Oasis, Ted Baker and Warehouse, all
  of which trade solely online in the UK. Fashion retailers are facing heavy
  competition from cheap, fast-growing online players including Shein and Temu,
  which benefit from a tax break on imported goods sent straight to shoppers.
  River Island, formerly known as Chelsea Girl, began selling clothing under the
  name Lewis’s in the 1940s. In a plan first announced in June, the retailer
  said it needed £10m in funds by the second week of September. It warned that
  that figure could rise to £50m by the end of the year. River Island said it
  would not be able to continue trading as a going concern and would be subject
  to administration or other insolvency proceedings if it could not agree a deal
  to slash rents and close some stores. The fashion retailer blamed its woes on
  “a sharp rise in the cost of doing business over the last few years” and the
  shift to online shopping, which, it added, had left it with a large portfolio
  of stores that was no longer aligned to its customers’ needs. River Island
  swung to a £33.2m loss in 2023, according to its latest accounts filed at
  Companies House, after sales fell by more than 19% to £578.1m. In 2022 it made
  profits of £2m. The company said it had lined up £40m in new funding from the
  investment vehicle of the Lewis family, who founded and still control the
  business. The successful progress of the deal is likely to be closely watched
  by other retailers and their advisers as Poundland, Claire’s and Hobbycraft
  also consider how to reduce the size of their high street chains.
