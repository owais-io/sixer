  Donald Trump said on Saturday he was nominating Tammy Bruce, the state
  department spokesperson, as the next US deputy representative to the United
  Nations, which would make the former Fox News commentator an ambassador. The
  president made the announcement on Truth Social, where he praised Bruce as a
  “Great Patriot, Television Personality, and Bestselling Author”. She has been
  serving as the chief spokesperson for the state department since Trump took
  office this year. Trump said Bruce, who had no prior foreign policy experience
  before being named state department spokesperson in January, “will represent
  our Country brilliantly at the United Nations”. Bruce is a former radio host
  who was a commentator on Fox News for more than 20 years, where she also
  served as an occasional guest host of Trump favorite Sean Hannity’s show. She
  served as the president of the National Organization for Women’s Los Angeles
  chapter from 1990 to 1996. Before her political conversion to conservatism,
  she hosted a radio show where her outspoken views were broadcast widely on Los
  Angeles station KFI, and she was one of the few radio commentators
  representing the progressive movement at that time. Bruce was fired from her
  radio job after she vocally protested OJ Simpson’s 1995 acquittal and later
  became a critic of progressive feminism. She rose to national prominence
  thanks to her conservative TV appearances and writing. In 2002, Bruce
  published her book The New Thought Police, in which she claimed to “expose the
  dangerous rise of Left-wing McCarthyism”. She was also briefly a contributor
  to the Guardian’s opinion pages. Bruce, a lesbian who was given an award by
  the Log Cabin Republicans at a Mar-a-Lago gala in 2022, has been outspoken in
  her opposition to transgender rights. She has shared articles that spread
  misinformation about the trans community, including pieces featuring
  anti-trans “detransitioner” activist Chloe Cole. As a spokesperson, she has
  defended the Trump administration’s foreign policy decisions, ranging from its
  mass deportation policies to its handling of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and
  Gaza, which Trump had promised on the campaign trail he would quickly end. If
  Bruce is confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, she could be in post
  before the man nominated to be her boss, Mike Waltz. The former national
  security adviser’s Senate confirmation for US ambassador to the UN has
  reportedly been stalled by Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who clashed with
  Waltz over his prior support for keeping US troops in Afghanistan.
