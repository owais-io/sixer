  More than 60 countries around the world are scrambling to respond to the
  latest wave of US tariffs announced by Donald Trump, which came into force on
  Thursday. Industry representatives in rich and poor countries warned of job
  losses as the tariffs upended a decades-old world trading system with rates
  ranging from 10% to 39%, 40% and 41% for Switzerland, Brazil and Syria. All
  over the globe, leaders were attempting to put contingencies in place after
  Trump’s tariff threats turned to reality at a minute past midnight Washington
  time. The Brazilian government said it was planning a state aid plan for
  companies affected. The president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the duties
  were “unacceptable blackmail”. Switzerland said it was seeking new talks with
  the US after a last-gasp mission to Washington by its president, Karin
  Keller-Sutter, failed to stop a 39% tariff blow that industry group Swissmem
  described as a “horror scenario”. In a statement after an emergency meeting
  with Keller-Sutter, the Swiss cabinet said the tariffs would “place a
  substantial strain on Switzerland’s export-oriented economy”. “For the
  affected sectors, companies and their employees, this is an extraordinarily
  difficult situation,” Keller-Sutter told reporters. Taiwan is also continuing
  talks with the US. Its president, Lai Ching-te, said the 20% rate imposed on
  the key Washington ally was “temporary”. Ireland, which is locked into an
  EU-US deal setting the tariff ceiling at 15%, said it would publish a new plan
  for diversifying an economy that relies heavily on US multinationals including
  Intel, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, all in Trump’s crosshairs. Despite a
  last minute reprieve from Trump for Lesotho with tariffs dropping from 50% to
  15%, the impoverished African nation said it was already hurting. Textile
  industry players in the country – which produces jeans and other garments for
  US companies including Levi and Walmart – said the uncertainty around tariffs
  over the past few months had already devastated the sector, with orders
  cancelled and jobs cut. Laos, which, like Brazil and Myanmar, was hit with a
  40% rate, was among those handed a steep increase in import duties because of
  a trade imbalance with the US. “A 40% tariff is just a nail in the coffin for
  any industry trying to ship to the United States,” Johannes Somers, the
  executive chair of the garment manufacturing firm Diep Vu, told Agence France
  Presse. “We estimate about 20,000 workers or more could be impacted,” added
  Xaybandith Rasphone, the head of the Association of the Lao Garment Industry.
  The sweeping “reciprocal” rates were announced by the White House a week ago,
  just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse. Just before the
  tariffs came into effect at midnight, Trump claimed on social media that
  billions of dollars would start flowing into the US as a result. However,
  while the customs duties make countries’ exports more expensive and less
  competitive, they are payable on import and usually passed on to the customer.
  “The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left
  court that wants to see our country fail,” the president wrote in capital
  letters, referencing an ongoing case in the US court of appeals, which is
  considering whether he exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs. Some
  trading partners had already secured reductions through negotiations or by
  striking deals, including the UK, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the
  Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and the EU. The EU is the only
  trading partner where its baseline rate of 15% will include previous tariffs.
  It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit with import duties of
  14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%. However, the deal has only been
  implemented in part with tariffs of 27.5% still being imposed on EU car
  imports while the details of the US-EU deal are being finalised. Hildegard
  Müller, the president of the German car industry federation, said the EU-US
  deal had “brought no clarity or improvement” to the industry. “The sectoral
  tariffs on cars and automotive parts of 27.5%, which have been in effect since
  April and May respectively, remain in place and place a significant burden on
  German automakers and automotive suppliers, as well as on transatlantic trade.
  “It is important that the promised agreement is reached now and the relief
  measures are implemented promptly,” she said. India’s 25% tariff rate could
  rise to a total of 50% after Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday
  imposing an additional levy in retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil
  from Russia. Delhi has 21 days to respond. Trump has threatened to use the
  same tactic on other countries that supply Russia.
