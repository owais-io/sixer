  An Oklahoma man is facing charges of child sexual molestation after an
  11-year-old girl in his orbit gave birth in her home, and her mother is
  accused of enabling abuse in a case that a local assistant district attorney
  called possibly “the most serious … I have ever prosecuted”. The charges that
  the Muskogee county district attorney’s office filed against Dustin Walker,
  34, on Monday came after a DNA test confirmed he was the father of the newborn
  at the center of the case, the Oklahoma news outlet KWTV reported, citing
  officials. The woman charged alongside Walker – the parent of the newborn’s
  underage mother – is 33. As is the outlet’s policy, the Guardian is not
  identifying her or describing her relationship to Walker to protect the
  identity of the abuse victim in the case. Walker and the woman had initially
  been arrested on one count each of felony child neglect after the 11-year-old
  gave birth to a full-term baby at her home on 16 August, according to records
  filed in court and reported on by NBC News. The two adults allegedly claimed
  that they did not know the girl was pregnant despite the fact that the minor
  was “rather petite” and her newborn was of a normal size, local assistant
  district attorney Jennifer Hutson told KWTV. Hutson also said to the station
  that the abuse victim had not been to the doctor in more than a year,
  preventing physicians or nurses who may have encountered her from detecting
  her pregnancy and being required to report it. According to Hutson’s remarks
  to KWTV, the 11-year-old either was not in school or may have been
  homeschooled, further ensuring the pregnancy went unnoticed. After a DNA test
  established he was the newborn’s father, Walker on Monday was met with an
  additional count accusing him of sexually abusing the 11-year-old girl
  beginning in January, resulting in her giving birth, as the court records
  reported on by NBC noted. Authorities, meanwhile, tacked on an enabling child
  sexual abuse count against the 11-year-old’s mother. “This child is
  traumatized,” Hutson said to KWTV of the abuse victim. “She’s been through a
  horrific ordeal. Not only has somebody gotten her pregnant, but she gave birth
  at home without medical assistance, and this will be her life for the rest of
  her life.” Walker and the 33-year-old woman are also accused of neglecting
  five other children in their care since at least January, NBC also reported,
  attributing the information to court records. The network said those other
  children are between the ages of 2 and 9. The 11-year-old’s mother and Walker
  have been in jail in lieu of $100,000 bail, KWTV reported. Hutson reportedly
  said that Walker and the 11-year-old’s mother – who are tentatively due in
  court in September – could receive up to life imprisonment if convicted as
  accused. In a statement reported by NBC, Hutson said: “This is one of the most
  if not the most serious child sexual abuse and neglect cases I have ever
  prosecuted.” • In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on
