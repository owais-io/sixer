  Energy costs will rise by more than expected for millions of British
  households this autumn after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill
  increased by 2% to £1,755. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, will
  raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of
  just over £35 a year for the average home as colder weather sets in. The
  increase is in part because of an expansion of the government’s warm home
  discount scheme, which is expected to add about £15 to a typical bill while
  providing an extra 2.7 million households with a £150 reduction in their
  bills, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight, an energy consultancy. About
  9 million households who buy their energy through variable tariffs will see an
  immediate impact on their bills when the cap takes effect in October.
  Households could face even higher bills if they use more than the typical
  amount of energy. This is because the cap, which is recalculated every three
  months, limits the rate energy suppliers can charge customers for each unit of
  gas and electricity – not the total bill. The price of electricity will rise
  from 25.73p per kilowatt-hour over the summer to 26.35p a kWh from October
  under the price cap, while the price of gas will fall to 6.29p a kWh, from
  6.33p a kWh over the summer, to reflect the modest falls in wholesale market
  prices. Standing charges will rise, too, to help cover the costs of
  maintaining and upgrading Great Britain’s energy networks. The electricity
  standing charge will rise from 51.37p a day to a rate of 53.68p, while the
  standing charge for gas will rise from 29.82p per kWh to 34.03. Responding to
  the price cap announcement, the Labour party blamed high bills on the previous
  government’s policies towards renewable energy and attacked the Reform leader
  Nigel Farage’s plans to turn away from greener energy sources. “Energy bills
  soared under the Conservatives because they tied our country to the fossil
  fuel rollercoaster and working people are still paying the price,” a
  spokesperson said. “From banning onshore wind to failing to deliver new
  nuclear, their reckless decisions left Britain exposed to wholesale gas prices
  that are still 75% higher than before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “That’s why
  Nigel Farage’s unpatriotic war on clean energy would be a total disaster for
  families, businesses and our economy. His destructive plans would push bills
  higher, kill nearly a million jobs and scrap billions of pounds of vital
  investment across the country that will strengthen our energy security. “This
  Labour government’s plan for change is protecting consumers, with 3 million
  more families getting £150 off their bills through the warm home discount, a
  total of 6 million in all, as we continue to invest in clean homegrown power
  to bring energy bills down for good.” The higher-than-expected increase in the
  average dual-fuel price cap follows a brief reprieve from rising energy bills
  over the summer, when the energy price cap fell by 7% to £1,720 from July
  because of lower market prices. The return to rising energy bills means the
  typical household will pay about £600 a year more on its annual bill than
  before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused gas market prices to soar.
  The rising price cap is likely to reignite the debate over the affordability
  of the UK’s energy as households look ahead to winter. Official figures show
  that household energy debts reached a record high of £4.15bn at the end of
  last winter. The total debt and arrears figure has accelerated in the past two
  years even as energy bills have stabilised relative to the record increase in
  2022. Cornwall Insight has predicted that the price cap will fall slightly in
  January, depending on weather patterns, on whether geopolitics affects market
  prices and on whether new policy costs, such as those to support investment in
  new nuclear generating capacity, are added to bills.
