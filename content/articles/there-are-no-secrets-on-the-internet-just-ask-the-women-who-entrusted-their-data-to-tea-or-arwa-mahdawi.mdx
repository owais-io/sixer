  Help me out with a question I’ve been pondering, will you? I’m trying to
  figure out if there is a single adult on Earth whose personal information
  isn’t for sale somewhere on the darker corners of the internet. Data breaches
  are a regular occurrence now. We give companies our information; they promise
  to keep it safe and then they sell it to dodgy third parties or lose it in
  hacking attacks. There is a website called haveibeenpwned.com where you can
  check if your email addresses have been part of a data breach. My personal
  email is in 15 of them. The latest data breach to hit the headlines is
  particularly nasty. A popular women-only dating-safety app called Tea lets
  users compare notes about men to see if they are dating the same person or if
  anyone has red flags to share. It’s a bit like an app version of the popular
  “Are we dating the same guy?” Facebook groups. Last Friday, the company behind
  Tea confirmed it had been breached. Women have to submit a selfie (to “prove”
  their gender) in order to use the app; an estimated 72,000 images, including
  13,000 verification photos and photos of government IDs, have been leaked
  online. More than 1m private messages have also been leaked. This isn’t just a
  run-of-the-mill data breach – it’s revenge. It seems users of 4chan, a message
  board popular with rightwing and misogynistic trolls, were upset by the app
  and called for a “hack and leak” campaign. 404 Media reported that the
  database of stolen images has now been posted on 4chan and X. Someone has
  reportedly even created a site where men can rate women’s selfies exposed in
  the leaked data. There are obviously numerous ethical issues with apps such as
  Tea, or the Facebook groups that allow people to share unverified and
  potentially defamatory information about men. But there is a reason these
  digital whisper networks exist: social media companies and dating sites do
  very little to protect women. According to one survey, 31% of women reported
  being sexually assaulted or raped by someone they had met through an online
  dating site. Tea was supposed to be a rare safe space – but now I suspect a
  lawsuit is brewing. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Do you have an
