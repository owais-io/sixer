  Writing about Hooper in his autobiography, director Hal Needham claims the
  film pioneered the concept of outtakes. Subsequent films would feature flubbed
  line readings, misbehaving props, actions gone wrong and various other
  bloopers in their credits sequences. But Hooper – a film about, as its tagline
  proclaims, “the greatest stuntman alive!” – uses its final minutes to showcase
  extra stunts that didn’t make the final cut. Instead of leaving them on the
  cutting room floor, these outtakes instead make the stunt performer’s
  (typically effaced) labour not only visible, but a point of celebration. An
  original ditty, Nothin’ Like the Life (Of A Hollywood Stuntman), was even
  commissioned as the soundtrack. In film production, the success of the stunt
  performer is paradoxically predicated on their invisibility. They do the work
  of constructing the star’s image while maintaining the illusion that they were
  never there at all. In return, stars do interviews and claim – almost always
  falsely – that they “do their own stunts”. It’s this idea that Hooper –
  starring megastar Burt Reynolds, hot off the success of his and Needham’s
  previous collaboration, Smokey and the Bandit – lays out, turning the
  spotlight on the unsung profession and foregrounding the stunt performer as
  not a faceless entity but the film’s star. Needham, a former stuntman and
  perhaps the first in Hollywood to move from rigging wires to sitting in the
  director’s chair, shoots the film with a palpable reverence for the
  profession, informed by his experience on more than 300 films and 3,000
  episodes of television. (In Reynolds’ own autobiography, he claims that
  Needham was so good at vehicle stunts that he earned the nickname “the master
  of suspension”.) Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Hooper seems to live
  a relatively glamorous life as a stuntman. Clocking off from his role as stunt
  performer and coordinator on the fictional Bond riff The Spy Who Laughed at
  Danger, he returns to his ranch to be met by his girlfriend, Gwen (Sally
  Field), a fistful of beers and a horse to drink them with. All the brewskis
  are part of the problem; Hooper’s an addict and an alcoholic, whose tendency
  to mask the pain of his many falls with pills and booze keeps him at arm’s
  length with his sweetheart. He embodies an archetype Gwen’s all too familiar
  with: her own father, Jocko (Brian Keith), is an ageing stuntman himself,
  equally in the wars. “You should drink more,” Jocko tells Hooper. “Nothing
  hurts when you’re numb.” As his doctor informs him, Hooper’s next accident
  could be his last – a danger accentuated by his director’s desire to flout
  safety precautions. Making matters worse, Hooper has to contend with new blood
  personified in the hotshot Ski (Jan-Michael Vincent). Ski’s affection for
  aerial antics and coiffed hair brings to mind none other than Tom Cruise,
  whose own turn towards stunting stardom – via high-profile, high-pressure
  capers – remains a high point of the latter-day Mission: Impossible films.
  Contrastingly, much of Hooper’s pleasures come from its lax and loose
  structure. The spectacle of the stunt almost becomes secondary to the
  amusement of hanging out with Hooper and his buddies: a post-bar brawl party
  at Hooper’s house isn’t a rambunctious rave, but a sleepy screening of his
  stunt reel, the room silent but for the flicker of the projector. A scratchy
  print showcases a bi-plane gag of Hooper’s own. The film-within-a-film’s
  director is a thinly veiled dig at New Hollywood auteur Peter Bogdanovich,
  whom Needham worked under, found pompous, and wrote skewering dialogue for. He
  takes glee in making the character bluster. “Films are tiny pieces of time,
  and we captured it!” goes one stuffy comment – but I like to think there’s
  some truth in there. Every stunt recorded is a small miracle – and Hooper
  captures the magic. Hooper is available to stream on HBO Max in Australia and
  available to rent in the US. For more recommendations of what to stream in
