  It has been one of the great conundrums of this window, leaving people
  pontificating over what Harvey Elliott should do next. The midfielder was,
  arguably, the leading light in England’s European Under-21 Championship
  triumph, but it still feels like minutes will be hard to come by at Liverpool.
  Many have suggested he would suit the Bundesliga and RB Leipzig seem to think
  the same and have got in touch with Liverpool to see if something can be
  worked out. Supposedly Newcastle have a plan B if they do not land Benjamin
  Sesko from Leipzig, although considering they have missed out on so many
  players this summer it is more like a plan T. The latest contingency walks,
  talks and gets booked just like Nicolas Jackson, mainly because it is the
  Chelsea striker. There is a parallel universe where Sesko hot foots it to St
  James’ Park, leaving Manchester United light of a No 9, which would then lead
  them to bid for Jackson to fill the void. But it does not end there, because
  Ollie Watkins could once again be back on the Ruben Amorim dartboard and Aston
  Villa are fortifying themselves for a bid. One person that will certainly be
  at Manchester United this season is Harry Maguire, despite the centre-back
  being the focal point of a whopping five offers, which seems a lot. Premier
  League and Serie A clubs have purportedly made bids, while Galatasaray and
  Besiktas are interested, as well as Monaco and Marseille who could make a move
  when Maguire’s contract is up at the end of the season. Newcastle are facing a
  hectic final few weeks of the window, having struggled to do much business.
  While everyone is distracted by Alexander Isak and the subsequent fallout,
  people are forgetting they really need a centre-back, too. Milan’s Malick
  Thiaw is one potential target for Eddie Howe, who is searching for the Italian
  dialling code and a number for San Siro so he can make an enquiry. Considering
  every man and his dog has needed to sign a new striker this season, it comes
  somewhat of a surprise that Dominic Calvert-Lewin is still unemployed. The
  former Everton frontman is available for free and the latest club to bat their
  eyelids in his direction are promoted Sunderland. Jacob Ramsey has brought a
  bit of tittle and plenty of tattle in recent weeks. First, Nottingham Forest
  were credited with wanting to sign the Aston Villa midfielder and now West Ham
  are being linked with a £40m move for the 24-year-old. As he has risen through
  the ranks at Villa Park, any income made from his sale would be pure profit in
  the back pocket, which cheers up the money men. Speaking of Forest and central
  midfielders. Depending on who you believe, they are in talks to sign Douglas
  Luiz from Juventus or are desperate to secure the services of Mads Bidstrup
  from RB Salzburg. Down in the Championship, the former Manchester United
  defender Brandon Williams is set to return to football after a year away. He
  has recently been on trial at Hull, who are keen to sign him, but plenty of
  other second-tier teams hold a candle for him.
