  The former immunizations director of the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention has warned of the future of American health under the leadership of
  Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. In an interview on
  Sunday with ABC, Demetre Daskalakis – who resigned this week in protest over
  the White House’s firing of CDC director Susan Monarez – said: “From my
  vantage point as a doctor who’s taken the Hippocratic Oath, I only see harm
  coming.” He went on to add: “I may be wrong, but based on what I’m seeing,
  based on what I’ve heard with the new members of the Advisory Committee for
  Immunization Practices, or ACIP, they’re really moving in an ideological
  direction where they want to see the undoing of vaccination.” Daskalakis’s
  interview comes amid growing chaos across US health agencies and rare
  bipartisan pushback towards the White House’s firing of Monarez, which came
  amid steep budget cuts to the CDC’s work as well as growing concerns of
  political interference. There have also been growing public calls for Kennedy
  to resign, particularly as he has continued to make questionable medical and
  health claims – and be lambasted in response by experts and lawmakers alike.
  Explaining his resignation, Daskalakis said: “I didn’t think that we were
  going to be able to present science in a way free of ideology, that the
  firewall between science and ideology has completely broken down. And not
  having a scientific leader at CDC meant that we wouldn’t be able to have the
  necessary diplomacy and connection with HHS to be able to really execute on
  good public health.” Daskalakis also criticized Kennedy’s recent changes to
  the childhood Covid-19 vaccine schedule, noting that the vaccine is currently
  approved only for people aged 65 and older, as well as for children and adults
  with underlying health conditions. “That’s not what the data shows. Six months
  old to two years old, their underlying condition is youth. 53% of those
  children hospitalized last season had no underlying conditions. The data say
  that in that age range, you should be vaccinating your child. I understand
  that not everybody does it, but they have limited access by narrowing that
  recommendation. Insurance may not cover it,” Daskalakis said. He also cast
  doubt on Jim O’Neill, the new CDC chief who was a top aide to Kennedy and has
  no training in medicine or infectious disease science. In response to whether
  or not he trusts O’Neill saying that he is in favor of vaccines, Daskalakis
  said: “Honestly, I really want to trust it … But based on the very first post
  that I’ve seen from him on X where he says that CDC scientists manipulated
  data to be able to follow an ideology or an agenda in the childhood schedule,
  makes me think that I know what leader he serves, and that leader is one that
  does not believe in vaccination.” In a Saturday op-ed for the New York Times,
  Vermont senator Bernie Sanders accused Kennedy of “endangering the health of
  the American people now and into the future”, adding: “He must resign.” Since
  he assumed leadership over the health department, Kennedy – a longtime
  anti-vaccine advocate – has fired health agency workers and entertained
  conspiracy theories. Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at
  US health agencies signed a letter in which they criticized Kennedy as an
  “existential threat to public health”. The health agency workers went on to
  accuse the health secretary of being “complicit in dismantling America’s
  public health infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly
  spreading inaccurate health information”. The letter comes after a deadly
  shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, when a
  30-year-old gunman fired more than 180 rounds into the buildings, killing a
  police officer before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter
  had been struggling with mental health issues and was influenced by
  misinformation that led him to believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him
  sick, according to the gunman’s father.
