  Last month, I wrote an article about being adopted by a British couple during
  the era of China’s one-child policy. Three days after the story ran in a
  national newspaper, my phone buzzed with a flurry of messages from a friend
  who had sent me a TikTok post by an influencer telling her life story to
  camera. Twenty seconds into her video, my jaw plummeted. She had recited
  entire sections of my article, word for word, to her 20,000 followers. She
  didn’t even have the courtesy to give me a credit. When I wrote that piece,
  the idea of exposing personal details of my life to scrutiny or criticism was
  terrifying. Even so, it felt right to share this story in the hope that others
  might find comfort if they too had had similar experiences. What I wasn’t
  expecting was for someone to take my words and claim them as their own. The
  influencer spoke of her adoption but she took sections of the article in which
  I discussed my intimate thoughts and feelings, and passed these off as her
  own. She recited how “in my early twenties, I measured my self-worth in how
  many matches I got on Tinder or how many boys I was texting”, and having
  “imagined a childhood in China and being raised by my biological parents”.
  Taking the exact phrases I had written, she reposted them to her followers,
  and then thanked users in the comments when they complimented her. I
  understand that imitation is the highest form of flattery but this was blatant
  stealing. I commented on the video: “Have you heard of plagiarism?” Soon
  afterwards, her husband appeared in my DMs on Instagram. He told me I wasn’t
  “the only Asian in the world adopted in that time frame”, dismissed me as “not
  that special” and even claimed I had copied his wife’s original videos. I
  called them both crazy and immediately blocked him. After this, I felt I had
  to set the record straight. So the next morning I made a video arguing that
  the influencer was plagiarising my work and included clips of her video
  alongside my article as proof. In response to my TikTok, she and her husband
  posted a video, insisting: “Her story and experience is also my story and
  experience … I did not steal her story.” Hours later she posted another video,
  apologising for using my words and saying she was sorry for any hurt feelings,
  and that her intent was not “malicious”. She also messaged me privately to
  apologise. Plagiarism – passing off someone else’s words or ideas as your own
  without sourcing or credit – is a career-ending offence in most industries. At
  university, it was drilled into me that you could be expelled if your essay
  included too much text that borrowed from existing work without giving it
  credit. The message was explicit: you do not plagiarise. Yet on social media
  the message is far more ambiguous. While TikTok explains that copyright
  protects “original works of authorship” and bans users from posting content
  that infringes anyone else’s intellectual property, it also states that
  copyright does not extend to underlying ideas: “For example, a person may own
  the copyright to a film, but not the underlying plot or themes that are
  expressed in the film.” With Instagram, the platform encourages creators to
  post original content, but in practice plagiarism and infringement often go
  unnoticed unless a creator spots and reports it themselves. YouTube, at least,
  has built-in systems that can scan videos and let rights holders set the
  rules, but there is little to protect smaller creators whose ideas are stolen,
  or when work is lifted from across the internet. Platforms thrive on mimicry.
  Originality is rare. So much so that when someone creates something new, it’s
  often copied by thousands of others in a matter of hours, with little or no
  credit given to the original creator. The media critic and gaming YouTuber
  Harry Brewis, also known as Hbomberguy, made a video on plagiarism in 2023
  which became a surprise hit (it has clocked up some 38m views to date). He
  gave 17 examples where YouTube creators had stolen words, content and ideas
  from smaller creators or online forums, observing that “plagiarists seem to
  have this belief that they are better than their targets…: ‘Your ideas are
  wasted on you. They’d be much better served in my videos.’” Aspiring creators
  need content to help them gain followers, and established creators reliant on
  advertising revenue need to churn out content at pace. Any work, be it a piece
  of writing or a video, requires time and effort, but the incentive is to make
  a lot of work, quickly. In theory, audiences prize originality and fresh,
  exciting content – but for creators who post every day, publishing new content
  so often is unrealistic, leading some to copy and imitate others. The line
  between inspiration and theft can easily become blurred. An original idea
  trends when people are able to take a concept and make it their own, allowing
  memes and in-jokes to develop. Once enough people replicate an idea, it
  transforms into a trend and the source often disappears entirely. Take, for
  example, the Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday trend, which has inspired some 2.9m
  videos. Creators have taken the sound from the Jet2holidays advert and
  overlaid it on clips of things going spectacularly wrong – a tent catching
  fire, someone flying off a boat – turning the original ad into something
  entirely new. The flip side of this is that once an idea exists online, it’s
  regarded as fair game to copy without credit. My video went viral, with
  thousands of users in the comments supporting me and debating online
  plagiarism. My story then gained another life. Other creators posted “drama”
  and explainer videos of the situation I had already outlined in my video. I
  was delighted to see the situation sparking a wider debate, but I couldn’t
  help but be sceptical of their motivations. Were the people now weighing in on
  the story doing so to shed light on plagiarism or to chase views? At its best
  the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas, and where
  creativity inspires more creativity. Giving credit is non negotiable. It
  creates a positive cycle where new ideas build on old ones, and where the time
  and effort someone has put into their work is recognised. In giving credit
  where it’s due, creators may feel incentivised to create rather than race to
  produce quick shareable content in the fear that their work might be stolen.
  Originality deserves celebration – and not to be reduced to simply content
  mined for virality. Esme Hewitt is a freelance journalist
