  Standup about infertility, jokes about a Georgian gourmand, and an
  experimental clowning fever dream: the shortlist has been announced for the
  45th Edinburgh comedy award, and it’s as eclectic as ever. Featuring just the
  one previous nominee in the best show category (the Yorkshireman Ian Smith),
  the list highlights eight shows from more than 500 eligible, and includes
  previous best newcomer nominee Dan Tiernan, one half of the former double-act
  Norris and Parker, Katie Norris, and a man whose first two fringe shows almost
  killed him, the teacher turned standup John Tothill. Also included among the
  nominations, for an award recognised as the live comedy “Oscars” and with a
  star-making pedigree, are Ed Night, son of the comedian Kevin Day, with his
  show Your Old Mucker, and the only American act on the list, sometime SNL
  writer Sam Jay, with We the People – not the only show suggesting pushback
  against political correctness from unexpected quarters. From Canada, the
  “little bit niche and mostly gross” duo Creepy Boys are shortlisted for Slugs,
  in which they star as gastropods trying not to explore the state of the world.
  Arguably the favourite, meanwhile – probably the buzziest of the shows
  selected for the list – is Sam Nicoresti’s Baby Doomer, a high joke-count,
  leap-into-the-mainstream set about the comic’s gender transition. Also
  announced today, the nominees for best newcomer award, a prize secured in the
  past by acts including Sarah Millican, Tim Minchin and Tom (Ballad of Wallis
  Island) Basden. On that list are one or two acts who might rightly feel
  aggrieved to be denied a best show nod, most notably Elouise Eftos with her
  fantastically sly set Australia’s First Attractive Comedian. Excellent
  offerings by Ayoade Bamgboye and Toussaint Douglass otherwise lead a field
  that includes Salford’s Molly McGuinness, Ireland’s Roger O’Sullivan, New
  York-based clown-comic Kate Owens and the double act (also partners in real
  life) of Ada and Bron with their sketch show about misbegotten romances, The
  Origin of Love. No Edinburgh comedy award shortlist is complete without a
  grievance about acts unfairly overlooked – and this year’s standout omission
  is Cat Cohen, a former Edinburgh best newcomer whose musical comedy show about
  her recent stroke and ongoing self-absorption, Broad Strokes, is clearly one
  of the exceptional comedy sets on this year’s fringe. No matter: hers is a
  prodigious talent that will flourish with or without the awards’ further
  endorsement. I’d expected to see last year’s best newcomer Joe Kent-Walters
  nominated for his follow-up in character as ghoulish nightclub MC Frankie
  Monroe (but fair enough – it’s not a big step forward from last year), and
  reckon deadpan Aussie Dan Rath and mind-bending US sketch outfit Simple Town
  are unlucky to miss out. It would have been good to see sketch represented on
  the main shortlist – but perhaps the quartet’s short run disqualified them.
  The winners of this year’s awards, who bag £10,000 (for the main prize) and
  £5,000 (for best newcomer) will be announced at a ceremony this Saturday. Last
  year’s winner Amy Gledhill will present the trophy; other illustrious recent
  winners include Starstruck creator and star Rose Matafeo and those twin
  Netflix phenomena Hannah (Nanette) Gadsby and Richard (Baby Reindeer) Gadd.
  Alongside Nicoresti’s show, it’s worth keeping an eye this year on Tothill’s
  This Must Be Heaven, a frothily entertaining and erudite seminar about 1800s
  oyster-guzzler Edward Dando, and about Tothill’s brush with death from an
  exploded appendix on last year’s fringe. And after his nomination in 2023 for
  Crushing, don’t rule out Goole’s Ian Smith, as good a back-to-basics standup
  as any on the fringe, returning with more fretful humour on the topic of his
  low fertility. The judging panel for this year’s awards – now sponsored by DLT
  Entertainment and the Taffner Family Charitable Trust – comprises critics,
  members of the industry and comedy fans, and includes Sam Bryant of podcast
  service Audible, Josh Buckingham at the TV producer Hat Trick and Guardian
  comedy reviewer Rachael Healy.
