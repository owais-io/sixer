  The Walking Dead: Dead City 11pm, Sky Max Season two of the uneven but popular
  zombie spin-off set in a ruined New York reaches its double-bill finale. The
  search for her useless son has led to Maggie (Lauren Cohan) being captured.
  Things aren’t looking much better for her frenemy Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)
  who suspects – rightly! – that smarmy rival Bruegel (Kim Coates) is up to no
  good. The story concludes for now with Maggie having to make a painful choice.
  Graeme Virtue Saving Lives at Sea 8pm, BBC Two More tense and tearjerking
  real-life rescues in the company of RNLI lifeboat crews. In Newhaven, East
  Sussex, a yachtsman is in serious danger amid gale-force winds. In south
  Devon, a kayaker is found in agony after a family outing takes a turn for the
  worse. Hannah J Davies Supercruising: Life at Sea 8pm, Channel 4 The last bon
  voyage in this series about the not-so-thrilling life on a cruise. We’re
  onboard the MS Nieuw Statendam this time, which is headed for north Africa and
  Europe. Excurions include gondola rides in Porto and fishing in Tenerife. Back
  on deck, florist Noven is working his magic on designs for guests to enjoy. HR
  Inside the Ambulance 8pm, U&amp;W Another busy day for paramedics in
  Portsmouth and Oxford caught on their bodycams. They respond to a cycling
  accident due to a suspected stroke, a woman who has had a bad fall and a baby
  who is suffering multiple seizures. HR Tom Kerridge Cooks Spain 8.30pm, ITV1
  Tom’s Spanish food journey takes him to Extremadura, where he joins local
  fishers at Lake Orellana to catch crayfish, bound for a classic salad. Next,
  he’s off to the melon fields of Murcia. “But not just any melon. It’s a piel
  de sapo melon. What does that mean? ‘Toad skin.’” It tastes amazing, though.
  Ali Catterall Talking Pictures: The Silence of the Lambs 9.35pm, BBC Four
  Celia Imrie digs deep into the BBC archives to revisit one of cinema’s most
  sinister stories. There are interviews with Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and
  the late director Jonathan Demme, along with a look at how one of film’s most
  terrifying characters jumped from book to big screen. The movie follows. HR
