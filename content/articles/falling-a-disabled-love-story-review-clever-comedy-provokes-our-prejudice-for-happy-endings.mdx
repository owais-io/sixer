  Falling: A Disabled Love Story review – clever comedy provokes our prejudice
  for happy endings
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  Stories will be everywhere in the coming weeks of the Edinburgh fringe. Some
  we will want to hear, others to dismiss. Perhaps we will yearn for the kind of
  uplifting tale given to us initially by Aaron Pang – about a tragic accident
  and his overcoming of adversity to find true love. Or perhaps we will demand
  something grittier. In his sweet and clever one-man show, Pang offers to give
  us both. First, he leads us into a happy-ending trap; a story that is not what
  it seems. Then, he questions our need to see him, a disabled man who walks
  with leg supports and a cane, as the conquering hero of his own story. Would
  we think less of him if the dice had not rolled in his favour? To demonstrate
  how programmed we are, he shows us a diagram of a classic story arc, mirroring
  the tale he has just told. Even then, with our eyes wide open, we still want a
  narrative in which everything works out. He gives us the option of two
  endings, Choose Your Own Adventure style, and smiles wryly when we vote for
  the most comforting. Connie Chen’s simple, chatty production sits somewhere
  between standup and spoken word, framing the actor as charming, cheery and
  self-aware as he describes with humour and not a little poignancy the mismatch
  between his erotic desire and physical capability. What starts as a standard
  coming-of-age tale about a boys’ school chorister making fumbling approaches
  to the girl he fancies turns into something sharper and deeper. Pang is brave
  in his willingness to talk about a sex life that deviates from the social norm
  and gently provocative in his needling of the audience: what prejudice lies
  behind our impulse for the perfect story in an imperfect world? • At the
  Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival
