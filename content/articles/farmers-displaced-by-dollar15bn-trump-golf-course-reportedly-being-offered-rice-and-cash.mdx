  Villagers whose farms in Vietnam will be bulldozed to make way for a $1.5bn
  golf resort backed by the Trump family have reportedly been offered rice
  provisions and cash compensation of as little as $12 for a square metre of
  land by state authorities. Thousands of villagers will be offered compensation
  based on land size and location, according to a report by Reuters. The agency
  spoke to elderly farmers who said they feared they would struggle to find a
  stable livelihood. The sprawling golf resort, the first project by the Trump
  Organization in Vietnam, broke ground as the country scrambled to reach a
  crucial trade deal with the US. Vietnam, which is heavily dependent on
  exports, was facing the threat of a 46% tariff in April, which has since been
  reduced to 20% for many goods. Vietnam’s prime minister said the project
  played an important role in deepening the country’s relationship with the US
  and that villagers would be reimbursed. Pham Minh Chinh added that he hoped
  the development would create jobs and improve livelihoods. The project will
  include a 54-hole VIP golf course, luxury resorts, high-end villas and a
  modern urban complex, according to state media. Reactions among local people
  have been mixed, with many farmers suggesting the compensation rates are too
  low. The New York Times reported in May that the development had been approved
  unusually fast and was allowed to break ground even though at least half a
  dozen legally required steps, including environmental reviews, had not been
  conducted. The White House has denied suggestions of a conflict of interest,
  saying the business deals of the Trump Organization are entirely separate from
  trade negotiations and that Donald Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by
  his children. However, disclosures in June showed income from those sources
  ultimately accrues to the president. The golf course development in Hung Yen
  province, south of Hanoi, is a joint venture between the Trump Organization
  and the Vietnamese real estate company Kinh Bac City. Trump’s family business
  is not involved in granting compensation to farmers, according to Reuters.
  Five farmers facing a loss of land told Reuters they had been informed
  reimbursements would be offered of between $12 and $30 for every square metre
  of farmland, with additional payments for uprooted plants and rice supplies
  offered for several months. A local official told the news agency that rates
  for farmland in the area had usually not exceeded $14 a square metre. All land
  is managed by the state in Vietnam, a communist country, with farmers given
  small plots for long-term use, which can be taken back by the authorities.
