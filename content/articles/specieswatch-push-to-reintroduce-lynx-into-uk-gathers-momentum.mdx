  The UK and Ireland are among the few countries in northern Europe without the
  apex predator the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Like most of Britain’s larger
  native animals, wolves and beavers, it was hunted to extinction, in this case
  about 1,300 years ago, helping to push the UK towards the distinction of being
  the most nature-depleted country in Europe. The campaign to reintroduce lynx
  into Kielder Forest in Northumberland is gathering momentum and expects a
  sympathetic hearing from the Labour government, although sheep farmers among
  others, may hold different views. The lynx, which has been successfully
  reintroduced to four European countries while remnant populations survive
  elsewhere, is basically a big cat weighing a maximum of 25kg, about the size
  of a springer spaniel. They hunt at night, and would principally eat some of
  the overpopulation of roe deer in the Kielder Forest, but would also hunt and
  eat foxes, hares and rabbits. They are generally regarded as excellent for
  keeping a healthy ecosystem in balance. The irony of such introductions is
  that lynx increase tourism dramatically with visitors hoping to see the wild
  cat. However, with the animals so elusive that they have to be fitted with
  trackers before release to find out where they have gone, this would be
  unlikely.
