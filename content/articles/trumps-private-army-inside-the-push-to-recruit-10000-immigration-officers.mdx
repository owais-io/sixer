  The last time the US dramatically expanded its force of immigration officers,
  major problems arose. Some border agents recruited in the 2000s turned out to
  be cartel members. One kidnapped and raped three women in his custody. Two
  others were convicted of off-duty murders. Now, as Donald Trump vows to build
  “the largest deportation operation” in history and kicks off a huge
  recruitment spree, human rights advocates and former Department of Homeland
  Security (DHS) officials are warning that misconduct and violence by officers
  could increase as a result. Bolstered by an unprecedented $170bn in funding
  for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the DHS is seeking to hire 10,000 new
  Ice officers and 3,000 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents by the end
  of the year. In its desperate race to staff up and meet the aggressive goal of
  3,000 immigration-related arrests a day set by Trump’s deputy chief of staff,
  Stephen Miller, the DHS is now advertising substantial incentives for Ice
  recruits. That includes a signing bonus of up to $50,000 and as much as
  $60,000 in student loan repayment. It has expanded the officer recruitment
  age, which was generally 21-40, to all people 18 and over, and has shortened
  training periods to get agents in the field faster. It has launched a prolific
  social media campaign, featuring memes and imagery that critics say echo white
  supremacist ideologies. In the past, US officials have repeatedly dismissed
  misconduct, or even crimes, by immigration officers as anomalies. Watchdogs,
  however, argue corruption and abuse within Ice and CBP is rampant – and that
  the White House’s hiring tactics threaten to supercharge problems. “Abusive
  practices, misconduct and a sense of impunity have long existed within these
  agencies,” said Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service
  Committee’s US/Mexico border program, which tracks officer misconduct. “There
  are systemic problems with accountability … and a culture of violence.” Daily
  misconduct When the border patrol nearly doubled its workforce between 2005
  and 2011, expanding from 11,300 to 21,400 agents, hiring guidelines were
  changed and training requirements were loosened, according to the Associated
  Press. Agents were rushed through the academy before background checks were
  done. Ralph Basham, George W Bush’s CBP commissioner, told Politico Magazine
  in 2014: “We made some mistakes. We found out later that we did, in fact, hire
  cartel members.” Reports of misconduct by immigration officers increased.
  Nearly one CBP officer was arrested for misconduct every day from 2005 to
  2012, Politico found. CBP shootings and use-of-force complaints surged from
  2007 to 2012. In 2018, a border patrol agent was arrested for killing four
  women, the same year another agent was arrested for killing his girlfriend and
  their baby and three other CBP officers were accused of sexually assaulting a
  colleague on office furniture they deemed the “rape table”. In 2019, dozens of
  border patrol agents were caught in a racist Facebook group. In recent years,
  former agents were convicted of kidnapping, sexual assault and accepting
  cartel bribes, and there were continued reports of sexual assault behind bars.
  “The problems of overreach, abuse and weak accountability at DHS stretch
  across presidential administrations,” said Spencer Reynolds, senior counsel
  for the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center, a
  non-profit. “These issues are baked into a department that has very broad
  mandates and operates with significant discretion.” The hiring spree could
  exacerbate those problems. In addition to expanding the age eligibility, the
  DHS was speeding up onboarding for new hires by condensing training from 13
  weeks to eight, officials recently told NBC News, and reducing Spanish
  classes, firearms courses and classroom instruction. The existing training,
  advocates say, was already failing to prevent misconduct. Michelle Brané, the
  former immigration detention ombudsman under Joe Biden, said that she was
  concerned that it appears that some Ice and CBP officers have “a very poor
  understanding of the law – when you’re allowed to arrest somebody, when you
  need a warrant, what is a valid warrant, or even basics about how people are
  supposed to enter the country” – and that was before training periods were
  shortened. Some agents wrongly believed people could apply for asylum from
  Mexico or cross the border at ports of entry that CBP had, in fact, blocked
  off – ignorance that could fuel agents’ anger at immigrants, she said: “It
  creates resentment among staff, and that’s when people start to get
  dehumanized and you get really horrific treatment.” ‘They want to be Trump’s
  private army’ The DHS’s hiring incentives and expanding eligibility suggest it
  could be struggling to meet the White House’s recruitment goals, though Ice
  said last month it had received more than 100,000 applications in two weeks.
  Lilian Serrano, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, an
  advocacy group, said the DHS had long recruited in low-income communities
  where there are minimal prospects for good jobs: “Some see border patrol as a
  way of getting a well-paid job that will lift them and their families out of
  poverty, even though that job means targeting their own communities.” Serrano
  was particularly concerned that Trump’s recruitment was targeting youth, with
  events at schools in border communities. Serrano’s coalition has tracked
  border patrol misconduct and killings for years – and has seen agents’
  behavior worsen this year, she said: “The shift has been immediate, with
  agents being more emboldened to openly violate their own policies even when
  they know they’re being recorded.” Rapid recruitment would worsen those
  problems, she said. Scott Shuchart, a former senior Ice official under Biden,
  said he was concerned about white supremacists and violent extremists getting
  hired as the DHS lowers its standards and speeds up enrollment: “The scary
  ones are the people who want to be Trump’s private army, the insurrectionists,
  the Proud Boys, the Klansmen and others who might be coming out of the
  woodwork.” Historically, efforts to prevent the hiring of officers prone to
  crimes were more focused on cartel ties, though the January 6 insurrection,
  which saw off-duty officers from across the country joining rioters, made
  officials more aware of the threats of far-right infiltration in recruitment,
  Shuchart said. While background checks might still block the hiring of white
  supremacists with criminal records, he said he doubted there were any efforts
  targeted at weeding out these ideologies in recruitment. Those fears have been
  exacerbated by the message in the DHS’s online recruitment efforts, and as the
  DHS has celebrated its harsh treatment of immigrants, whether with the
  department’s secretary, Kristi Noem, filming herself at an El Salvador prison
  with men jam-packed into a cell, or the DHS posting a meme of alligators as
  Ice agents in Florida. Recent DHS recruitment advertisements have used
  language like “Defend your culture!”, “Secure the Golden Age” and “Want to
  deport illegals with your absolute boys?” One X.com recruitment post featured
  an Uncle Sam image and said, “Which way, American man?”, which observers
  quickly pointed out was similar to the title of a 1978 white nationalist book
  that defended Hitler. The DHS said it was conveying that Uncle Sam was “at a
  crossroads, pondering which way America should go”. “The message is: ‘We are
  intentionally causing harm in order to encourage people to leave
  voluntarily,’” said Brané. “Cruelty is the point, and they seem proud of it. I
  worry you now have [recruits] coming in with the idea that they are there to
  harm immigrations and be as cruel as possible … It is clearly going to lead to
  more violations of human rights. There will be more abuse and mistreatment,
  whether physical or verbal, and less concern for people’s wellbeing and due
  process.” Spokespeople for the DHS, Ice and CBP did not respond to interview
  requests and detailed inquiries about its recruitment strategies and officer
  misconduct. ‘Recipe for disaster’ Experts see the developments as reflective
  of larger systemic shifts. “Cutting back on training goes along with the
  complete collapse of the rule of law in this country,” Shuchart said, noting
  that Trump’s immigration crackdown had relied on unconstitutional practices
  and illegal actions, including racial profiling in Los Angeles and unlawful
  deportations. “You don’t have to spend weeks teaching someone immigration law
  if you’ve decided the law just means the president gets to deport anyone he
  wants. Direct monarchical rule without law doesn’t require a lot of training
  by the king’s foot soldiers.” That lack of accountability is exacerbated by
  the erosion of oversight. Noem has shut down DHS oversight offices meant to
  uncover and prevent misconduct, efforts that advocates said were already
  inadequate. “They are rushing the hiring of these sensitive positions while
  gutting the institutions responsible for ensuring oversight and spewing
  incredibly dehumanizing rhetoric about the people who are subject to these
  policies,” said Noah Schramm, policy strategist for the ACLU of Arizona. “It’s
  a recipe for disaster.” Advocates are particularly worried about reductions in
  accountability as Trump deploys border patrol agents to cities, including Los
  Angeles and Washington DC. “Border patrol is not trained in crowd control. And
  some agents see themselves as a military force,” said Reynolds. In LA, border
  patrol agents were caught making false statements about protesters they
  arrested in June. A judge earlier this year also criticized the border patrol
  for conducting warrantless immigration stops, saying: “You just can’t walk up
  to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers.’” Reports of racial
  profiling by CBP and Ice in California have continued. “There will be an
  increased level of civil rights violations, and the public has no recourse to
  address them,” Rios said. Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch
  Network, an immigrants’ rights coalition, said the vast expansion of Ice and
  CBP will have far-reaching consequences. “No amount of training or slowing
  down hiring will address Ice’s culture of secrecy and impunity,” Suh said.
  “What we’re really concerned about is how difficult it is to shrink the system
  once it is expanded. This hiring spree will have a devastating impact on our
  communities for years to come. It means more people will be targeted and
  detained, more people will be coerced in detention to accept deportation, and
  violence inside prisons will get worse.”
