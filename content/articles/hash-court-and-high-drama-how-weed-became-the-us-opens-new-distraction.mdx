  The US Open has always been the unruliest of tennis’s four grand slam
  tournaments, a place where the soundtrack is as much screeching trains, the
  roar of air traffic overhead and well-lubricated crowds as it is the thwack of
  racket on ball. Frances Tiafoe likes to call it “organized chaos”, the sort of
  life-affirming atmosphere that he says teases out his best performances. For
  some, it’s no stage at all but a blur of bass-heavy changeovers,
  revolving-door celebrity cameos and the ceaseless rattle of the nearby No 7
  subway. In recent years, though, one distraction has cut through even the
  normalized bedlam that gives the tournament its character. Alongside the honey
  deuce cocktails and free-flowing Heineken, a different vice has threaded
  itself into the fortnight: the pungent and unmistakable odor of marijuana. It
  drifts across the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center with enough
  frequency that players have begun treating it as not a bug but a feature of
  the event itself. Casper Ruud, the 2022 US Open runner-up from Norway, was the
  latest to complain during last week’s mixed doubles tournament while paired
  with Iga Świątek. “For me, this is the worst thing about New York,” he said.
  “The smell of cannabis. It’s everywhere, even here where the tournament is
  being played. But we have to accept it. I think it’s annoying to be on the
  court while someone smokes a joint. It’s no fun for us players to be tired and
  have to inhale the smell of hashish at the same time. We can’t do anything
  about it unless the law changes, but I doubt that will happen.” The complaints
  have been loud enough that Danish media have even dubbed Court 17 hash-banen –
  the “hash court” – cheeky shorthand for the bullring-like show court where the
  aroma of weed has become nearly as much a part of the atmosphere as the noise
  of the crowd. The USTA has maintained a strict no-smoking policy since at
  least 2011, when New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg’s smoking ban was expanded
  to public parks, beaches and pedestrian plazas. Yet since New York legalized
  recreational cannabis in 2021, Flushing Meadows has become a microcosm of the
  state’s shifting culture. Within the grounds, security enforces the rules (if
  not aggressively). But take a few steps just outside into Corona Park, which
  abuts the south end of the grounds, and anyone over 21 can legally toke up:
  under the 2021 law, adults may possess up to 85 grams of cannabis and smoke it
  anywhere tobacco use is permitted. On Sunday afternoon as the first day of the
  tournament unfolded, smokers fired up prerolls within clear view of the
  gaggles of police outside the South Gate. The shift has been embraced by city
  leaders. Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, even encouraged New Yorkers
  to “enjoy yourself, light up, but most importantly – spend some money.” That
  permissive stance, coupled with a patchy licensing rollout that has allowed
  hundreds of unregulated storefronts to flourish, has made cannabis feel
  inescapable across the five boroughs – and this particular expanse of Queens
  is no exception. The smell of weed at the US Open, however, predates
  legalization. In 2014, Martina Hingis remarked on it during a doubles match on
  the old Grandstand court. Since then, a parade of players – Nick Kyrgios,
  Maria Sakkari, Alexander Zverev – have all voiced frustration. Sakkari’s 2023
  first-round loss to Rebeka Masarova became one of the more notorious episodes.
  Midway through the match she pleaded with the chair umpire about the
  distraction, later telling reporters: “Sometimes it smells food, sometimes it
  smells cigarettes, sometimes it smells weed. It’s something that we cannot
  control because we’re in an open space. There’s a park behind. People can do
  whatever they want.” Kyrgios, combustible at the best of times, was incensed
  during his second-round win over Benjamin Bonzi in 2022. He urged the umpire
  to remind spectators not to smoke, complaining the odor was particularly harsh
  on his breathing as an asthmatic. “It was fucking marijuana. Obviously, I’m
  not going to complain about food smells,” he’d later say. “But probably not
  something I want to be breathing in between points.” Afterward he admitted the
  distractions of New York – heckling fans, roaring trains, and now marijuana
  smoke – made it harder to stay locked in point to point. Zverev was blunter.
  After a match on Court 17 two years ago, the German likened the atmosphere to
  “Snoop Dogg’s living room”. The intimate, 2,800-seat stadium with no reserved
  seating, which has become a fan favorite since the demise of the old
  Grandstand, has also earned a reputation as the epicenter of the smell.
  Zverev’s assessment has since taken on a life of its own. A story this week
  previewing Thursday’s court assignments quipped that Holger Rune had been sent
  to hash-banen for his second-round match, creating an aura that has proven
  stickier than your highest-grade kine bud. Tournament officials have resisted
  the suggestion that Flushing Meadows has become a stoner’s playground. “While
  we can’t control what takes place off the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean King
  National Tennis Center, we continue to be vigilant as we maintain this
  facility as a smoke free environment,” a USTA spokesperson told the Guardian
  this week. “This includes enforcement by our security and guest services teams
  when they are made aware of any individual that may be smoking, making them
  aware that although it may be legal in [New York], that smoking is not
  permitted on parks property including the tennis center. We constantly work
  with the NYPD and Parks Department, and we believe this has helped to decrease
  any smoking near our fenceline.” After Sakkari’s comments in 2023 made
  headlines, the USTA reviewed video footage and interviewed staff. “No
  evidence” was found of fans lighting up inside Court 17, a tournament
  spokesperson said. Instead, officials suggested, the smoke likely drifted from
  Corona Park. Players themselves have acknowledged as much. Marketa
  Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, said after her match that same year:
  “I smelled it actually today also. You smell it a lot. I think it’s just Court
  17. That court is so far away, it’s almost in the park. I think it’s coming
  from the park.” From the organizers’ perspective, nothing has changed. It’s
  not like the posters of past tournaments which line the bowels of Arthur Ashe
  Stadium have been swapped out for Bob Marley photomosaics and the Pink Floyd
  Back Catalogue. The USTA still sells itself as the buzziest of the four slams,
  but emphatically not that kind of buzz. But it’s not only spectators who are
  leaning in to the relaxed attitudes toward cannabis. One camera operator, who
  requested anonymity to protect his job, said he now relies on edibles to get
  through marathon shifts that sometimes stretch past 16 hours. Security
  staffers stationed by the outer courts have noted the same. “We can’t police
  what happens outside in the park,” one said. “You catch a whiff on every
  corner. Around here, it’s just normal.” For all the gripes, the rules are
  clear: within the gates, smoking of any kind, including weed pens, is banned.
  Beyond them, the USTA has no jurisdiction. Fans, too, seem largely unfazed.
  Steven Lewis, waiting in line for a Court 17 match on Monday afternoon, waved
  off the complaints. “You can smell it walking down the street in Midtown,
  sometimes at eight in the morning on a weekday, and it was the same even
  before it was legalized,” he said. “It’s just a part of New York. I don’t see
  why the Open would be any different.” Indeed, part of the intrigue here is
  cultural. The Open has always leaned into its identity as tennis’s loudest,
  least buttoned-up major. For players more accustomed to the hushed lawns of
  Wimbledon or at Roland Garros – where there is a total ban on alcohol in the
  stands to ensure a respectful atmosphere during play – it can feel like
  sensory overload. For locals, it’s just the city in microcosm. Legal marijuana
  is now embedded in New York life. That reality sits uneasily against the prim
  image tennis still projects, but the contradictions are unavoidable at a
  tournament staged in the heart of Queens. As Ruud lamented, even before
  Wednesday’s second-round loss on the hash court, there may be little recourse
  beyond plugging one’s nose and focusing on the next point. Some players thrive
  in it and others recoil. Either way, the Open keeps rolling.
