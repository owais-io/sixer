  When Hulk Hogan died and a rush of people searched his name on Google to read
  various obituaries, I’m sure at least some of them were shocked to find that
  one of the most popular search terms related to the WWE Hall of Famer is “Hulk
  Hogan lies”. There are countless videos, Reddit threads, social media posts
  and articles detailing all the things the Hulkster apparently said that were
  either exaggerations, distortions or outright fabrications. One time, Hogan
  said he was asked to play in Metallica. The band denied the story straight
  away. Hulk said in his autobiography that he partied with John Belushi after
  WrestleMania 2 in 1986, even though Belushi had died in 1982. There’s also the
  time where Hulk thought the Jackass star Bam Margera was dead when he very
  much was not. If you aren’t a wrestling fan (you’re reading the Guardian.
  You’re probably not a wrestling fan) you might wonder why someone who was
  famous for four decades would feel the need to lie about whether he could have
  been in Metallica. These are the sorts of lies the quarterback of your high
  school tells at the reunion. “Andre the Giant was 700lb when I bodyslammed him
  in from of 200,000 people at the Roman Colosseum” is definitely an anecdote
  that could get you a free shot at the no-host bar at the Elks Lodge, but if
  you’re Hulk Hogan, you could just be honest and say Andre was more like 400lb
  and the crowd was between 80,000 and 93,000, depending on whom you ask. Also,
  it was in Pontiac, Michigan, not Rome. Hulk Hogan did not need to lie, but he
  did. Often. Lying, fabrication and multiple layers of reality are fundamental
  tenets of professional wrestling at every level of the industry. In 2019, I
  worked at WWE as a writer for their TV show SmackDown just long enough to get
  fired. I wasn’t there for enough time to actually get good at the art of
  crafting a compelling wrestling story, but I was there long enough to realize
  that the most crucial element of wrestling is some form of dishonesty. The
  performer’s job is to approximate reality, to portray their character not just
  on TV, but on social media, in the press, and sometimes even at the airport.
  Wrestling is performance art on an entirely different level. Terry Bollea had
  to live his life as Hulk Hogan – the bandanna, the tank tops, the white
  moustache. In his now-infamous reality show, Hogan Knows Best, despite the
  conceit of seeing inside Hulk’s real home, he was still that character. Terry
  Bollea was so committed to being Hulk Hogan that he had a formal bandanna for
  black tie events. No one would be mad if he wore, say, a Kangol hat or maybe …
  no hat at all? When Hogan testified in the Gawker trial, it was shocking to
  hear him refer to “Terry Bollea” and “Hulk Hogan” as two different people. In
  the pro wrestling parlance, this veil of fiction is called “kayfabe” – a word
  with its origin in the old-timey carnival culture that wrestling evolved from.
  Kayfabe is both a noun to describe the glorious unreality of wrestling and a
  verb to describe when someone is subtly lying to you (or hiding something
  incredibly important). In WWE, there are layers of kayfabe, with fewer and
  fewer people smartened up to what’s happening the deeper you go. The outcomes
  of the matches are kayfabed. Who is wrestling in the main event of
  WrestleMania 42 next spring is super kayfabed. This doesn’t seem that terribly
  different from protecting the ending of a summer blockbuster film, but when
  you’re inside the business, you realize that everything can be kayfabed. How
  can you trust anything anyone says? WWE just launched a reality show on
  Netflix called Unreal, which claims to lift the veil on the behind-the-scenes
  creation of their storylines. I immediately said to myself: “This is just
  another layer of kayfabe.” The sacred work of wrestling is to make people
  believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosity.
  This is the world Hulk Hogan lived in. I still love wrestling, and despite the
  horrible things he said and did, I still see Hulk Hogan the character as one
  of the most influential heroes in American history. He managed to make the
  most mundane, thunderingly obvious credo (“say your prayers and eat your
  vitamins, kids!”) sound revolutionary. He knew how to captivate an audience
  with nothing more than a gesture. He understood the art of platonic seduction
  – the way to get someone to not just love you, but to think that their
  struggle is also yours. Wrestling fans – both children and adults – could live
  vicariously through Hulk Hogan. His appeals in his speeches were to his
  “Hulkamaniacs”, the fans that gave him the strength to do the impossible. At
  WrestleMania 3, if Andre the Giant wanted to beat Hulk Hogan for the WWE
  Championship, he’d also have to contend with the millions of Hulkamaniacs
  cheering for him. In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member,
  are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel for you to travel in.
  If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. One of Hulk Hogan’s last
  televised appearances was at the Republican national convention in 2024. He
  tore a Trump T-shirt off his body instead of a Hulkamania shirt and pledged
  his full fealty to our future president. In some twisted way, it was a passing
  of the torch. For years, Hulk Hogan had been the apex of wrestling’s art of
  unreality. His talent for leading the masses peaked around 1988, and as the
  world got more savvy about WWE’s particular magic trick, the connection
  severed. He left for a rival company, became a bad guy, and reinvented the art
  form again. But it could never be quite what it was in the mid-80s. Wrestlers
  such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock and John Cena could captivate a
  crowd, but it was nothing like Hulkamania. No one would or could ever truly
  believe like that again. This is why WWE has to open up (or at least pretend
  to), like the Soviet Union at the end of the cold war. After years of sitting
  under the learning tree of WWE’s former owner, Vince McMahon, Donald Trump
  took the tools of platonic seduction that Hulk Hogan perfected and applied
  them to politics. The use of the word “we”, the commonality of struggle, the
  dastardly enemies to defeat in righteous combat. Even the empty slogans. Is
  “make America great again” that far removed from “say your prayers and eat
  your vitamins”? When Hulk Hogan exaggerated a story or outright lied, he’d
  very rarely retract his statement. When he was allowed back in the WWE locker
  room after tape of his racist tirade circulated publicly, he spent most of his
  apology warning fellow wrestlers to be careful about “getting caught”. Hulk
  Hogan was a man who made his own truth. He didn’t need to do anything other
  than live in the world he made for himself. The more he made up about himself,
  the grander he became. He was truly the greatest American hero, because he
  personified the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be you.
  And the more he fashioned himself a superhero, the more we wanted to be him –
  to fully merge with him into one entity. This power was both awe-inspiring and
  perhaps the most terrifying weapon any human being could wield in this life.
