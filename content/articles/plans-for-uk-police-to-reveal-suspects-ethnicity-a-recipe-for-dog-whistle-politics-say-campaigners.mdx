  politics’, say campaigners

  Plans to disclose the ethnicity and immigration status of criminal suspects in
  the UK have been condemned by race campaigners for setting a dangerous
  precedent for “dog-whistle politics”, which will make “Black and brown
  communities more vulnerable”. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has welcomed
  new police guidelines released on Wednesday which encourage forces to release
  the race and nationality of those charged in high-profile cases. It is meant
  to combat misinformation on social media, which spread last summer after the
  murder of three schoolgirls in Southport. False information about the killer’s
  nationality, religion and asylum status fuelled widespread unrest throughout
  the country. But race campaigners believe the move may encourage focus on the
  racial background of suspects, and will lead to further rightwing conspiracy
  theories when information is not released to the public. Enny Choudhury, the
  co-head of legal at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said:
  “Releasing the ethnicity of everyone suspected of serious crimes will … simply
  fuel mistrust, deepen divisions, and make Black and brown communities more
  vulnerable to prejudice and harm. “Some point to cases like Southport, where
  rumours were quashed by releasing specific information. But building a blanket
  policy around this is dangerous. It turns race into a variable in policing and
  public debate – when we know the vast majority of serious crimes, including
  sexual offences, are committed by white men. “The role of the justice system
  should be to unite communities in pursuit of justice, not to single people out
  because of their ethnicity.” Peter Herbert, from the Society of Black Lawyers,
  questioned the role of the police around issues of ethnicity and nationality
  when forces still face allegations of institutional racism. He said: “The
  disclosure of ethnicity in particular is especially sensitive. People have
  never committed crimes on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality, and
  therefore the whole premise about releasing this information in certain cases
  sets a dangerous precedent. “One only has to remember the misinformation the
  surrounded the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes to understand the police
  themselves are often guilty of putting out misinformation which exacerbates
  public concern and fear. “Conspiracy theorists are rarely satisfied by
  official announcements and therefore tagging ethnicity and nationality, even
  in a limited amount of cases, opens a dangerous door to widespread xenophobia
  and racism, enabling the criminal justice system to be used for dog-whistle
  politics.” The guidance, which comes into immediate effect, was developed by
  the National Police Chiefs’ Council in recognition of “public concerns”, and
  to ensure police processes were “fit for purpose in an age of rapid
  information spread”. This month Reform UK accused authorities of hiding the
  identities and immigration status of two men, reported to be Afghan asylum
  seekers, charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire.
  In May, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s winning of
  the Premier League title, Merseyside police disclosed in the public interest
  that the man arrested was white and British, in order to quash rumours of a
  terrorist attack. Decisions on releasing such information will remain with
  police forces, with wider legal and ethical considerations also taken into
  account, the NPCC said. Verifying a suspect’s immigration status will be up to
  the Home Office, not the police. Diana Johnson, the policing minister, said
  the government will want police to release these details in “most cases”. She
  told the BBC that disinformation was a “bigger problem for society” and said
  that the government was working with social media providers to tackle the
  issue. The former Metropolitan police chief superintendent Dal Babu has warned
  of the “unintended consequences” of the new guidance, which he said could lead
  to more online speculation in cases where these details are not released. “The
  danger is there will be an expectation for police to release information on
  every single occasion,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Home Office
  will not be encouraging the release of ethnicity and immigration status in all
  cases, and there are notable occasions when it has not. One such incident is
  the case of Rhiannon Whyte, from Walsall, West Midlands, who died three days
  after being stabbed last October. The ethnicity of the arrested man was not
  disclosed at the time by the police or the Home Office despite demands on
  social media. Deng Chol Majek, 19, an asylum seeker from South Sudan, has
  pleaded not guilty to her murder. Officials plan to consult police and other
  agencies whenever a request for information about a suspect’s ethnicity or
  immigration status is received. Ministers are said to be well aware of their
  responsibilities to the wider community and have already had to deal with a
  steady flow of requests for information about suspects.
