  For those of us in the northern hemisphere, September is an excellent time to
  search for the faint constellation of Capricornus, the sea goat, one of the
  oldest recognised constellations. It appears on Ptolemy’s second-century list
  of 48, and even before that on Babylonian clay tablets that date from a few
  thousand years BC. Capricornus is depicted to be a chimera, a mythical
  creature containing the body and head of a goat and the tail of a fish. In
  Greek mythology it is often associated with Amalthea, who hid the young Zeus
  from his child-devouring father, Cronos, or Pan the shepherd god. The
  constellation straddles the ecliptic, the annual path of the sun through the
  sky, which means it is one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac. The chart
  shows the view looking south from London at midnight as 1 September becomes 2
  September. The brightest star in the constellation is Deneb Algedi. Locate
  this and then work your way around the constellation. Pause when you get to
  the star Algedi and see if you can make out its fainter companion, situated in
  close attendance. From the southern hemisphere, Capricornus appears much
  higher in the north-western sky.
