  The Fox Network’s rotating lineup of animated sitcoms increasingly dominate
  the list of the longest-running scripted prime time shows ever made. Whether
  they’re the actual record-holder (The Simpsons), a once-canceled cult show
  turned institution (Family Guy, or the cable-channel-hopping Futurama), or a
  “newer” show that’s actually entering its 16th season (Bob’s Burgers), these
  shows leverage their age-defying format to serve as both a constant in their
  viewers’ lives and a living document of contemporary American life over their
  many years on the air. So it’s not unusual that King of the Hill, a Fox
  cartoon that aired in the late 90s and throughout the 2000s, would rejoin its
  corporate cousins for a 14th season on Hulu. But just as during the show’s
  original run, it’s an odd fit with those other, brasher animated sitcoms –
  sometimes blessedly so. It would be easy enough to characterize King of the
  Hill as a red-state Simpsons. Instead of bumbling everyman/id Homer Simpson,
  created by anti-establishment cartoonist Matt Groening, it focuses on the
  genially repressed Hank Hill (Mike Judge), created by satirical cartoonist
  Mike Judge. Hank is a buttoned-up propane salesman who values courtesy,
  patriotism, tradition and decency; in a switch-up from typical sitcom dynamics
  of its era, the show portrays Hank’s wife Peggy (Kathy Najimy) as the more
  hubris-prone buffoon of the two (especially as the seasons progress).
  Throughout the series, Hank struggles to connect with his preteen son Bobby,
  who doesn’t share his predisposition toward stoicism. And as with the
  Springfield of The Simpsons, the rest of the show is populated by residents of
  Arlen, Texas, a fictional but realistically rendered suburb of Dallas. Judge
  has always made it clear that he doesn’t consider King of the Hill principally
  political. Hank’s obvious conservatism has as much to do with his manner as
  his beliefs, which the show takes care to not root in bigotry or ideological
  stubbornness. Hank pre-visions sitcom characters like Ron Swanson, the
  anti-government government worker who became a favorite on Parks and
  Recreation. Unlike Ron, who was genuinely more effective with a touch of
  cartoonishness in earlier seasons before the show’s writers became addicted to
  portraying him as a genuinely great guy, Hank is always presented as
  even-keeled and sensible, with the show’s humor often coming from his
  squareness. The writers also do an admirable job of keeping its politics
  local, exploring how social changes (like “going green” in a later-period
  episode) affect Arlen in particular. The words “common sense” get thrown
  around a lot, in discussing the show and within the show itself. The sense of
  cartoon mischief that informs its other contemporaries (including Judge’s more
  satirical Beavis and Butt-Head) is minimal. For example, when The Simpsons did
  an episode about the Bush family, it playfully (if somewhat good-naturedly)
  caricatured ex-president George HW Bush as a Mr Wilson figure to Bart’s Dennis
  the Menace, a clever riff given that Bush had earlier targeted The Simpsons in
  a speech as less aspirational than family shows of yore. (Later presidential
  jabs were not so obtuse.) Beavis and Butt-Head once met Bill Clinton, and the
  show characterized him as having a little more in common with the boys than
  some would expect. Meanwhile, in the fifth-season premiere of King of the Hill
  set around the 2000 presidential election, George W Bush appears at a rally
  attended by an enthusiastic Hank, who loses faith in his preferred candidate
  when he gets a sample of a surprisingly limp handshake. Mostly, though, the
  episode is about taking pride in voting, no matter what compromises or
  surprises await in that process. The show didn’t change drastically, if at
  all, with W actually in office – or, for that matter, with the rise of Obama,
  though the show’s final episodes, aired during Obama’s first term, were likely
  produced before he was sworn in. That’s also an area where the show’s animated
  approach came in handy: It was able to run for well over a decade and only
  nebulously age its characters a few years. The approach was more akin to a
  newspaper comic strip than a weekly TV series, even a Simpsons-style cartoon
  (where the characters’ age stasis becomes part of its self-referential lore).
  Yes, the Hills could encounter George W Bush during the 2000 election, but a
  decade later, Bobby Hill could remain on the verge of adolescence, the show’s
  pace intentionally slowed; real-world details were introduced or elided at the
  show’s convenience. The lead characters’ consistency could remain a beacon of
  small-c conservatism, in the way that sitcoms can be inherently conservative
  with their episode-ending resets. The new season makes a major, bold move in
  that respect: It actually jumps forward in time. Bobby is now college-aged,
  though he’s running a restaurant in Dallas rather than matriculating anywhere
  in particular. Hank and Peggy have just returned from a multi-year stint
  living abroad in Saudia Arabia for Hank’s propane work, from which he has now
  retired back to Arlen. The viewers’ time away from the characters is at least
  in part granted to the characters themselves, something that The Simpsons has
  consigned to the realm of what-if episodes about the future (or episodes about
  an ever-revised, time-shifted past). It’s a poignant touch that, strictly
  speaking, may not have been necessary – at least not if the idea is for Hank
  to react to various modern-day devices, figurative and literal, with a little
  extra culture shock. Hank doesn’t actually need to dip out from the country to
  break out his trademark quiet consternation; he was plenty flummoxed by the
  natural course of history in the show’s original run. Though the time jump
  does generate fresh material for Bobby, and for Hank and Peggy’s newfound idle
  retirement, sometimes it also feels like a workaround for the topic of Trump
  and the degree to which conservatism has lost that small “c” as it shifts
  further and further to the right. Yet despite that avoidance, the newest
  season also feels like a specific product of the Biden era, which of course
  would have been when it was largely developed and written. Without mentioning
  any elections directly, the characters seem like they’re shaking off the worst
  cultural clashes of the first Trump term and the pandemic that capped it off.
  To that end, the gags that have to do with Hank and Peggy’s gap years from
  Arlen – like the ongoing retrospective saga of paranoiac Dale’s unlikely
  winning of Arlen’s Covid-era mayoral election, or their friend Bill becoming a
  shut-in – are lightly cathartic and very funny. When the first episode ends
  with Hank and Peggy comforted and heartened by the friendliness they receive
  from a diverse Arlen population, it’s appropriately heartwarming. It’s also
  sweetly funny to see Hank repulsed by the antics of a men’s-rights group that
  blames all their problems on “females”. On the whole, the new season is as
  solid as ever. Yet there’s something slightly off about the show treating this
  stuff as just another assortment of generational foibles. It’s an
  understandable instinct. King of the Hill sure isn’t trying to be a firebrand
  bellwether of good liberal outrage. It’s trying (usually quite successfully)
  to be funny, and the Trump joke sure isn’t funny anymore, if it ever was.
  Bringing Arlen into the Trump era without Trump is a way of modernizing the
  characters without turning their world into the kind of political lightning
  rod that would make Hank recoil. But it also seems designed to burnish Hank’s
  image; his particular conservatism can still look sensible if it doesn’t have
  to be associated with any unseemly actual conservatives. (The men’s rights
  guys, for example, are presented as misguided dopes misled by a bad apple.)
  The thing is, Hank doesn’t need the coddling. Plenty of good King of the Hill
  episodes do revel in his discomfort, even as they sympathize with him. The new
  season, good as it is, aims to give Hank a new dose of those temporary
  feelings in a relatively safe space. It’s not really the show’s fault, but
  there’s an increasingly blurry line between gently understanding humanism and
  letting everyone off the hook.
