  Good morning. Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing tariffs
  ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from dozens of trade partners, in his
  latest attempt to reshape the global economy. However, in a minor reprieve
  that opens the door to further negotiations, the White House said these
  measures would take effect in a week, not Friday, the deadline previously set
  by Trump. The new rates, which Trump sees as benefiting US exporters, unleash
  a fresh round of uncertainty for dozens of countries, including longtime US
  allies. It has also raised fears of inflation in the US. Which countries have
  higher rates? Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for
  Taiwan and 30% for South Africa. Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The deadline
  for a tariff deal with Mexico was extended by another 90 days. The mathematics
  of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in Gaza The mathematics of famine
  are simple in Gaza. Palestinians cannot leave, war has ended farming and
  Israel has banned fishing, so practically every calorie its population eats
  must be brought in from outside. Israel knows how much food is needed. It has
  been calibrating hunger in Gaza for decades, initially calculating shipments
  to exert pressure while avoiding starvation. “The idea is to put the
  Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” a senior adviser
  to the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said in 2006. An Israeli court
  ordered the release of documents showing the details of those macabre sums two
  years later. What has Israel said? As Gaza has slid into famine this summer,
  Israeli officials have variously denied the existence of mass starvation,
  claimed without evidence that Hamas steals and hoards aid, or blamed hunger on
  UN distribution failures, sharing pictures of aid pallets awaiting collection
  inside the border. Virginia Giuffre wanted Epstein documents made public,
  siblings say The siblings of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most
  prominent accusers, who died this year, said their sister had wanted the
  so-called Epstein files to be released, and urged Trump not to pardon
  Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. In an interview with NBC News
  on Thursday, Giuffre’s family said she would have wanted the documents – a
  trove of materials related to the investigation into the late sex offender –
  made public. “She had a little bit of hope in her because it was said that the
  files were going to be released,” Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s sister-in-law,
  told the network in an interview, saying Giuffre would have wanted
  “transparency and justice” for his victims. What did they say about Trump’s
  comments this week that Epstein ‘stole’ Giuffre and others from Mar-a-Lago?
  “She’s not an object, she’s a person,” Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, said
  through tears. “She’s a mom. She’s a sister. And she was recruited by Maxwell.
  She wasn’t stolen.” In other news … Joe Biden has said the US is facing an
  “existential” fight and marginalized groups are “dramatically under attack”.
  The former president said some politicians watched deportations of legal
  immigrants with “glee”, in a speech to the National Bar Association gala.
  Justin Timberlake has said he is suffering from Lyme disease, a serious
  illness usually contracted after being bitten by a tick. There has been a
  surge in prevalence of the disease across a swathe of the US in recent years.
  The historian Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern
  Arab studies at Columbia University, has cancelled plans to teach this fall,
  in response to the school’s recent agreement with the Trump administration.
  Stat of the day: Trump to build ‘beautiful’ $200m ballroom at White House The
  White House will soon begin construction of a new $200m ballroom to be ready
  before Donald Trump’s term ends in early 2029. The press secretary, Karoline
  Leavitt, said the building would be 90,000 sq ft (8,300 sq metres) and would
  hold up to 650 seats. It will be the latest change introduced to what’s known
  as “the People’s House” since the Republican president returned to office in
  January. Don’t miss this: The enduring brilliance of Peter Sellers – ‘There’s
  never been a better comic actor’ The actor was born 100 years ago – and his
  performances still induce hysteria today. Fans and collaborators such as
  Michael Palin, Woody Allen and Lesley-Anne Down explain why. “Spike was the
  imaginative genius who wrote The Goon Show but it was Sellers who brought me
  to tears with his gallery of unforgettable characters: Major Bloodnok,
  Bluebottle, Henry Crun, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne,” Palin says. Climate check:
  Monarch butterflies’ mass die-off in 2024 caused by pesticide exposure, says
  study A 2024 mass monarch butterfly die-off in southern California was
  probably caused by pesticide exposure, peer-reviewed research has found.
  Researchers discovered hundreds of butterflies that had died or were dying in
  January 2024. Testing of 10 of the insects revealed an average of seven
  pesticides in each, and at levels that researchers suspect were lethal. Last
  Thing: Labubu for life – how did a viral doll became a ‘social currency’? Just
  ask these diehard fans Since hitting the market in 2019, Labubus have become a
  global phenomenon. Their popularity has been fueled by social media posts of
  live unboxings that showcase rare collections. Launches of new editions sell
  out on Pop Mart within minutes, sending the company’s profits soaring over the
  past year. Avid collectors say that acquiring the dolls has become almost like
  a “social currency”, according to one meet-up attender. Sign up First Thing is
