  Palestinians were gripped by fear and anxiety on Sunday after the Israeli
  military said it was preparing for the forcible displacement of 1 million
  people from Gaza City. The announcement came days after Israel said it
  intended to launch a new offensive to seize control of the territory’s largest
  urban centre, in a plan that raised international alarm, and ahead of the
  IDF’s latest attacks in the Palestinian territory which Gaza’s health
  officials said had killed at least 40 people on Saturday including a baby in a
  tent and people seeking aid. “Based on the directives of the political
  leadership, and as part of the Israel Defense Forces’ preparations to transfer
  civilians from combat zones to the southern Gaza Strip for their safety,
  starting tomorrow [Sunday], the provision of tents and shelter equipment for
  Gaza residents will resume,” read a statement by the Israeli Coordination of
  Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT). “The equipment
  will be transferred through the Kerem Shalom crossing by the United Nations
  and international relief organisations, after undergoing thorough inspection
  by the Land Crossings Authority of the Ministry of Defense,” it added.
  Meanwhile, new recordings broadcast by an Israeli TV station showed the
  Israeli general who headed military intelligence on 7 October 2023 saying that
  50 Palestinians “must die” for every person killed that day, and “it does not
  matter now if they are children”. The channel said the undated conversations
  were recorded “in recent months”. And in the US the state department announced
  that it would stop issuing visas to children from Gaza in desperate need of
  medical care after an online pressure campaign from Laura Loomer, a far-right
  influencer close to Donald Trump who has described herself as “a proud
  Islamophobe”. After Israel’s announcement, Palestinians in Gaza – displaced
  repeatedly, forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their homes,
  stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies – are bracing for another
  humanitarian disaster as a new offensive would force them toward the south of
  the territory and an uncertain future. “We are already destroyed and
  exhausted, physically and psychologically, from repeated displacement, from
  the lack of food and water,” Akram Shlabia, 85, told the Guardian from the
  Shuja’iyya neighbourhood of Gaza City. “And now they want us to go to the
  south. Into nothingness, into the unknown, into a place without shelter or the
  basic means of life, even safety.” “We will face many problems in
  displacement,” said Mazen Hasaneh, 40, from al-Tuffah neighbourhood, who has
  been displaced six times during the war. “First, securing a way to transport
  the necessary items like a tent and other basics, and of course many drivers
  will exploit people’s desperation and raise prices, while people have no money
  to pay. “The second problem is finding a place to set up the tent and settle,
  along with the difficulty of finding and providing water and food. Everything
  about displacement is suffering, especially in our current conditions.” Some
  families have already begun moving south to secure shelter in anticipation of
  possible evacuation, while others are contacting relatives to ask about
  available space should the relocation plan proceed. Yet many say they will
  remain in Gaza City, declaring they would rather stay than face the hardships
  of displacement. “If the plan is carried out, I will look for a safe place for
  myself and my children within Gaza, and I will not consider moving to the
  south of the Strip,” said Asma Al-Barawi, 34, from al-Tuffah, the mother of
  seven children. “I didn’t leave the first time, and I won’t leave this time.
  The experiences and suffering I heard from the displaced who went south were
  harsh and unbearable.” “I lost everything because of this war,” she added. “I
  lost two of my brothers, two of my maternal aunts with their families, my
  cousin, and my father-in-law. And, I lost my new home, which I only left with
  some clothes.” In recent days, heavy explosions have echoed from areas east of
  Gaza, where Israeli forces have intensified operations, including artillery
  barrages and the start of an incursion on the outskirts of the Sabra
  neighbourhood. On Saturday a baby girl and her parents were killed when an
  Israeli airstrike hit a tent in al-Muwasi, previously designated a
  humanitarian zone by Israel, in southern Gaza, Nasser hospital officials and
  witnesses said. “Two and a half months old, what has she done?” a neighbour,
  Fathi Shubeir, asked. “They are civilians in an area designated safe.”
  Israel’s military said it could not comment on the strike without more
  details. Al-Muwasi is now one of the most heavily populated areas in Gaza
  after Israel pushed people into the desolate area. But the prime minister,
  Benjamin Netanyahu, said last week that Israel planned to widen its coming
  military offensive to include the area, along with Gaza City and “central
  camps” – an apparent reference to the built-up Nuseirat and Bureij refugee
  camps in central Gaza. According to the civil defence agency, at least 13 of
  the Palestinians killed on Saturday were shot by troops as they were waiting
  to collect food aid near distribution sites in the north and the south. There
  were also another 11 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza over the past 24
  hours, the health ministry said on Saturday, including at least one child.
  That brought malnutrition-related deaths due to the Israeli blockade on aid to
  251. Meanwhile in Israel police blasted crowds with water cannons and made
  dozens of arrests on Sunday as thousands of protesters in Jerusalem demanded a
  deal to free hostages in Gaza. The demonstrators aimed to shut down the
  country with a one-day strike that blocked roads and closed businesses. Groups
  representing families of hostages organised the demonstrations as frustration
  grows in Israel over plans for the new military offensive, which many fear
  could further endanger the remaining hostages, about 20 of whom are believed
  to still be alive. “We don’t win a war over the bodies of hostages,”
  protesters chanted in one of the largest and fiercest protests in 22 months of
  war. Protesters gathered at dozens of places including outside politicians’
  homes, military headquarters and on major highways. They blocked lanes and lit
  bonfires. Police said they arrested 38 people. Israel’s military offensive has
  killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, most
  of them civilians. The figure does not include the thousands believed to be
  buried under rubble or the thousands killed indirectly as a consequence of the
  war.
