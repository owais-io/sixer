  Donald Trump is threatening to strip Washington DC of its local governance and
  place the US capital under direct federal control, citing what he described as
  rampant youth crime following an alleged assault on a federal employee who
  worked for the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). In a
  post on his Truth Social platform, the president said he would “federalize”
  the city if local authorities failed to address crime, specifically calling
  for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. “Crime in Washington,
  D.C., is totally out of control,” Trump wrote. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act
  together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of
  the City, and run this City how it should be run.” The threat received backing
  from Elon Musk, after the billionaire described an incident in which a member
  of the Doge team was allegedly “severely beaten to the point of concussion”
  while defending a woman from assault in the capital. “A few days ago, a gang
  of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in
  DC,” Musk posted on X. “A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to
  defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved
  her. It is time to federalize DC.” The victim was identified by friends and
  the police as Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old known as “Big Balls”, one of
  Doge’s most recognizable staffers who joined Doge in January. He reportedly
  left in June, and is currently employed at the Social Security Administration.
  According to a police report obtained by Politico, Coristine was assaulted at
  approximately 3am on Sunday by about 10 juveniles near Dupont Circle. Police
  arrested two 15-year-olds from Maryland, a boy and a girl, as they attempted
  to flee the scene, and charged them with attempted carjacking. A black iPhone
  16 valued at $1,000 was reported stolen during the incident. Trump’s post,
  which included images of a bloodied and shirtless Coristine, concluded: “If
  this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE
  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Washington DC currently operates under “home rule”,
  established in 1973, which grants the city an elected mayor and council while
  maintaining ultimate congressional oversight. No president has attempted to
  revoke this arrangement since its creation. Trump’s threat could theoretically
  take several forms. The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the
  federal district, though completely suspending local governance would probably
  require congressional legislation. Trump could also deploy federal law
  enforcement officers or national guard troops under executive authority, as he
  did during 2020 protests when federal forces cleared Lafayette Square outside
  the White House over local officials’ objections. But fully stripping the
  city’s home rule would probably face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress.
  Any such move would require congressional legislation that Democrats could
  block or attempt to challenge in federal courts. The president targeted DC’s
  juvenile justice system specifically. “The Law in D.C. must be changed to
  prosecute these ‘minors’ as adults, and lock them up for a long time, starting
  at age 14,” he wrote, referring to alleged attackers he described as “local
  thugs” and putting the word “youths” in quotation marks. Washington DC, with a
  population of about 700,000, has seen violent crime decline in the first half
  of 2025 compared with the previous year, and 2024 marked a 30-year low,
  according to a pre-Trump January report by the Department of Justice. The
  Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal
  interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full
  self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers
  have opposed. The office of the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined a request
  for comment.
