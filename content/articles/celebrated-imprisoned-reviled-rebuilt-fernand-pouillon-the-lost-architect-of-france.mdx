  Variously described as an “architect, painter, novelist, communist and
  convicted fraudster”, Fernand Pouillon’s life was punctuated by abrupt
  reversals of fortune that might have sprung from the pages of Dickens or
  Dumas. Throughout an eventful career, he ricocheted from intoxicating success,
  to financial scandal, prison, exile and eventual rehabilitation. In 1985, when
  Pouillon was in his early 70s, he was awarded the Légion d’Honneur by
  President François Mitterrand. Yet just over 20 years earlier, Pouillon found
  himself in custody awaiting trial on charges of corruption. As a prolific
  architect-developer who had designed gargantuan housing schemes in France and
  Algeria, he was accused of funding irregularities and violating laws contrived
  to keep the processes of design and construction separate. Staging a hunger
  strike, he was moved to a prison infirmary, from which he escaped by shinning
  down a rope smuggled in by his brother. On the run for eight months, he was
  dubbed “France’s most wanted architect”, before, with exquisite sangfroid, he
  turned up by taxi to the Parisian courthouse on the day his trial was due to
  begin. Sentenced to four years in jail, he passed the time by writing Les
  Pierres Sauvages (The Wild Stones), a bestselling novel about the construction
  of the medieval Cistercian abbey at Le Thoronet in Provence. The protagonist
  is a master builder who overcomes exacting working conditions and sceptical
  peers by dint of sheer willpower. Known as “Pouillon le manifique”, Pouillon
  was an iconoclast who relished the trappings of success. At one point he
  reportedly owned a Bentley, an Alfa Romeo, two chateaux, townhouses in Algiers
  and Paris, and a yacht. Photographs of the time show a suave, sharply suited
  man, with a luxuriant quiff of jet black hair, like a Gallic Bryan Ferry. His
  rise and fall is the subject of Fernand Pouillon: France’s Most Wanted
  Architect, a 2023 film by French documentary film-maker Jean-Marie
  Montangerand. “His personality and his antics overshadowed his work,” says
  Montangerand. “But his system was to build better, cheaper and faster than
  others so that everyone could live decently. He thought that beauty should not
  just be the privilege of the most well-off.” Showing for the first time in the
  UK, it examines Pouillon’s life and exploits, with current and historic
  footage of his housing in Paris, Marseille and Algiers. Pouillon remains a
  divisive figure. But in spite of his entanglements, his architecture has
  endured, its qualities becoming more appreciated over time by users and
  critics. Attuned to the historic form and dynamics of cities, his buildings
  have come to be seen as a more nuanced alternative to the “brave new world”
  ethos of modernism. His quartet of 1950s housing developments in Paris imitate
  the historic grain and texture of the city, with courtyards, loggias, gardens
  and promenades. And in the postwar heyday of concrete, he unfashionably
  favoured stone as a building material. “I hated the ugliness of render, the
  colour of concrete,” he declared in his 1968 autobiography. “For me, the
  century of reinforced concrete posed problems of appearance, of surface, of
  the skin of the building.” He favoured the creamy limestone of Provence, in
  its hefty, traditional, load-bearing form, as opposed to thin sheets clipped
  to a steel or concrete frame that constitute most of today’s “stone”
  buildings. “Pouillon was a modern architect but he was not a modernist,” argue
  Adam Caruso and Helen Thomas, who compiled one of the first English language
  monographs on Pouillon, nearly 30 years after his death in 1986. “He was
  modern in the sense that Édouard Manet was a supremely modern painter:
  attentive to the history of art and to the inevitable and necessary continuity
  of culture, while at the same time being fascinated and enmeshed in the
  appearances and social mores of contemporary life that played out around him.”
  What emerges from Montangerand’s film is a man driven by ambition, building at
  dizzying speed and volume in the often chaotic ferment of France’s postwar
  economic boom. As Pouillon himself put it, “200 housing units built in 200
  days for 200 million francs”. Yet he disdained the rabbit-hutch mentality of
  modernist mass housing – the grands ensembles that were springing up in and
  around French cities. “Imagine the sadness of all the people who, after
  working all day, leave their offices to sit in their rooms as if they’re being
  punished,” he wrote. Unlike Le Corbusier, the imperator of modernism, and a
  contemporary (though the two never met), Pouillon recoiled from theory and
  abstraction. For him, architecture was about building well and building
  efficiently, like the speculative developers of the Georgian and Victorian
  eras, optimising managerial processes and construction techniques to address
  specific economic and social needs. He understood the city as a network of
  public spaces, each with a different character to be experienced on the
  ground. “I build for the pedestrian, not the airplane captain,” he asserted.
  His career first took off when commissioned to rebuild large tracts of
  Marseille, razed by wartime bombing and Nazi destruction. In January 1943
  about 30,000 people were forcibly evicted from the historic Panier (“basket”)
  quarter housing immigrants and refugees, with 2,000 dwellings demolished by
  explosives. Pouillon’s reconstruction respects and reinstates the area’s scale
  and street pattern. New housing blocks feature workshops at ground level and
  humanising details, such as balconies enclosed by timber lattices. Down by the
  Old Port, a series of long, stone volumes resembling 19th-century dockside
  warehouses extend along the Marseille waterfront, now the haunt of tourists
  and flâneurs who might never notice the small plaque placed on one of the
  walls denoting Pouillon as the architect. Pouillon’s design skill and his
  ability to navigate between the competing interests of politicians, planners
  and bureaucrats caught the eye of the mayor of Algiers, Jacques Chevallier,
  who enlisted him to provide dwellings for the city’s expanding population, as
  opposition to France’s colonial rule intensified. Between 1953 and 1959,
  Pouillon oversaw the construction of three major residential projects, among
  them Climat de France, the largest housing project in north Africa at the
  time, with 3,500 dwellings designed to accommodate over 30,000 inhabitants
  structured around an expansive central square or maidan. While Pouillon
  publicly disavowed colonialism, his buildings were nonetheless part of an
  impetus to subjugate the Algerian Muslim population. Ultimately, however, they
  were co-opted by the very people they were meant to control. Ringed by 200
  three-storey high limestone columns, the monumental maidan at the heart of
  Climat de France became a familiar backdrop to political protest, from the
  Algerian war of independence to more recent confrontations during the Arab
  spring. “People have gradually taken ownership of these spaces, transforming
  and repurposing them,” says Montangerand. “The children of Climat de France
  now proudly declare themselves to live in ‘the Pouillon city’. Architecture
  should be judged by the amount of life it allows to develop, which is why
  Pouillon’s work still resonates.” Eventually released from prison in 1965, but
  shunned by the French establishment, Pouillon returned to Algeria, where he
  found a more receptive milieu in the country’s post-independence era,
  designing housing, universities, hotels and tourist infrastructure. In 1971 he
  received an official government pardon, a tacit acknowledgment that his
  downfall may have been politically as well as professionally motivated. Aided
  by Algerian craftsmen, Pouillon’s final years were spent painstakingly
  restoring an ninth-century chateau in Belcastel in the south of France, not
  unlike his master builder protagonist in Les Pierres Sauvages. When Le
  Corbusier died, his coffin was reverentially paraded through the courtyard of
  the Louvre accompanied by torch-bearers in military uniform. Conversely,
  Pouillon was not one for posthumous pomp. Today, he lies buried in Belcastel
  cemetery, in an unmarked grave. His many monuments are elsewhere. • Fernand
