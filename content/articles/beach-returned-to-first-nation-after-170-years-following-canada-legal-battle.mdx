  A stretch of beach will be returned to a First Nation in Canada 170 years
  after it was mistakenly omitted from its reserve. The sandy sliver of land
  measures less than two miles long, but has nonetheless sparked an outsized
  battle, with a nearby resort town claiming the case sets a foreboding
  precedent for property rights in the country. Canada’s supreme court said on
  Thursday that it would not hear a challenge from the town of South Bruce
  Peninsula, which is contesting a lower court’s ruling that the Saugeen First
  Nation’s reserve was erroneously smaller than promised. In its application to
  the country’s highest court, the town warned that a victory for the First
  Nation would “risk sowing uncertainty and unpredictability at the core of
  Canada’s system of private landholding”. Lawyers for the First Nation instead
  said the case was simply about the correct interpretation of a treaty – and
  the boundaries of the First Nations reserve under that agreement. Central to
  the fight is a stretch of beach popular in the summer months with tourists,
  who trek 140 miles from Toronto to enjoy the clear blue waters of Lake Huron.
  The Saugeen First Nation has claimed for decades that the official map of
  their reserve wrongly omitted a 1.5 mile stretch of beach promised to them
  under an 1854 treaty with the crown. In 2014, a truce looked likely after the
  First Nation and the municipality agreed that Saugeen would hold title over
  the land and the beach would be co-managed by Saugeen and the town council.
  The federal and provincial governments also pledged to make a one-time payment
  of C$5m (US$3.6m) to the municipality to offset their portion of the beach
  costs. But during municipal elections that year, mayoral candidates pledged to
  quash the agreement, pushing the land claims fight to the courts – and
  subsequently costing the community millions in legal fees. Two years ago, the
  First Nation emerged victorious and their win was upheld at the Ontario court
  of appeal. Earlier this year, the large sign welcoming visitors to Sauble
  Beach was changed to Saugeen Beach – a move seen as an “important and
  long-overdue act of reclamation” by the First Nation. Lawyers for the
  municipality and the private landowners have framed the previous court
  victories for Saugeen as precedent-setting, suggesting they are the first in
  Canada to be dispossessed of real estate to settle a treaty case. “The
  importance of these questions cannot be understated,” the town’s submission
  reads. “They strike at the very heart of Canada’s constitutional order, and
  will be increasingly brought into focus as Indigenous land claims over private
  property work their way through the courts over the next decade.” Nuri Frame,
  a lawyer representing the First Nation, said the case was much narrower in
  scope. “We’re talking about a very specific, very precise parcel of reserve
  land that was set aside for the Saugeen. The crown had failed to properly
  survey and demarcate that in the 19th century. It is very much a case that is
  about its facts, the language of this particular treaty, the scope of this
  particular reserve and the relationship between this particular First Nation
  and the crown,” he said, adding that at trial, the federal government admitted
  their error and had sided with the First Nation. “There is a large,
  longstanding body of case law in this country that recognizes an Indigenous
  people’s interest in its reserve land and that the crown has a fiduciary role
  in protecting and preserving those specific lands. It’s constitutional law
  101. Reserve land … is special, and First Nations are not to be dispossessed
  of their reserve land in all but the rarest of possible circumstances.” The
  case comes amid hand-wringing over private property rights in Canada after
  another court decision in western Canada, dubbed the longest running trial in
  the country’s history. In early August the British Columbia supreme court said
  the Cowichan Tribes, from Vancouver Island, had established Aboriginal title
  to roughly 800 acres of land south of Vancouver, where they once had a village
  to fish during summer. While the court did not rule against private
  landowners, it did determine the land titles held by the city and the federal
  government in the area were “defective and invalid”. Although there was no
  loss of property to landowners, the ruling nonetheless kicked off a wave of
  concerns. What makes the case unique and somewhat clearcut, Frame said, is
  that the First Nation reserve and treaty are historical outliers. “Nearly all
  of the historic treaties that were entered into between confederation and
  1921, they just promised that a reserve will be created and they prescribed a
  formula to be used to establish a reserve, for example how many acres per
  person or family and then a surveyor goes out and draws a map,” he said.
  “There are very, very few treaties in Canada that do what Saugeen’s does,
  which says the reserve is going to go from here to here to here to here.”
