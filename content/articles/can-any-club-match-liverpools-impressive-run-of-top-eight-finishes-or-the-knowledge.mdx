  “A mate mentioned the impressive statistic that Liverpool have not finished
  lower than eighth in the league since being promoted to the old First Division
  in 1962. Taking the 1962-63 season as the starting point, what is the lowest
  position that all current Premier League teams have finished between 1963 and
  the present?” ask the lads at the Star and Dragon Pub, Carbondale, Illinois.
  “And what is the lowest any team has fallen that has played at least one
  season in the top division since 1962-63?” How the mighty haven’t fallen.
  Liverpool have shown remarkable consistency since they were promoted to the
  top flight 63 years ago. They’ve finished eighth on four occasions (1962-63,
  1993-94, 2011-12 and 2015-16) and are the only English team in that period
  never to end a season outside the top half of the top flight. Thanks to Pete
  Salmon and Mike Slattery in particular for doing the work on this answer.
  Let’s start with the lowest positions in the league ladder achieved by the
  current Premier League teams. Liverpool 8th (1962-63, 1993-94, 2011-12,
  2015-16) Arsenal 17th (1975-76) Everton 19th (1979-80)* Manchester United 23rd
  (first in second tier, 1974-75) Tottenham Hotspur 25th (1977-78) West Ham
  United 29th (1979-80) Chelsea 40th (1982-83) Newcastle United 42nd (1991-92)
  Manchester City 47th (third in third tier, 1998-99) Aston Villa 48th (1970-71)
  Leeds United 49th (2007-08) Nottingham Forest 51st (2005-06) Sunderland 52nd
  (2019-20) Crystal Palace 55th (1962-63) Wolves 72nd (fourth in fourth tier,
  1986-87) Fulham 85th (1995-96) Brentford 87th (1973-74) Bournemouth 89th
  (2008-09) Burnley 90th (1986-87) Brighton 91st (1996-97, 1997-98) * Everton
  were not relegated as there were 22 teams in the English top flight.
  Fifty-eight teams have played in the top flight since Liverpool’s promotion in
  the summer of 1962. Six have dropped out of the Football League at some stage:
  Carlisle, Leyton Orient, Luton, Notts County, Oldham and Oxford. The lowest
  finishers of the six were Leyton Orient, who came 13th in the National League
  (105th overall) in 2017-18. While we’re here, we looked at the lowest
  positions achieved by various European giants in the same period. Before
  anyone starts foaming at the exclusion of Beloved Superstars FC, we restricted
  it to teams who have won the European Cup/Champions League more than once.
  Here’s how the European Super League (Legacy Edition) looks; the big numbers
  are the lowest league position for each team. 6th Barcelona 1962-63, 1964-65,
  1987-88, 2002-03 Benfica 2000-01 8th Liverpool 1962-63, 1993-94, 2011-12,
  2015-16 9th Porto 1969-70 Real Madrid 1976-77 12th Bayern Munich 1977-78 13th
  Ajax 1964-65 Internazionale 1993-94 17th Milan 1980-81, 1982-83 (first in
  Serie B) 21st Juventus 2006-07 (first in Serie B) 23rd Manchester United
  1974-75 40th Chelsea 1982-83 51st Nottingham Forest 2005-06 Eagles’ Wembley
  compilation “I’ve now seen Crystal Palace lift four different trophies at
  Wembley (Zenith Data Systems Cup, Championship playoff trophy, FA Cup,
  Community Shield),” writes Toby Kinder. “Manchester United and Liverpool never
  managed the ZDS, but have both won the European Cup there, as well as all the
  domestic trophies, so are probably on four too. Can any other club beat that?”
  Selhurst Park, Sunday, 2pm is all we have to say on this subject. “I feel bad
  for doing this, given the manufactured beef stirred up between our clubs this
  summer, but Nottingham Forest can go (at least) one better than Palace when it
  comes to winning different trophies at Wembley,” says Jim Hearson. “Forest can
  see the Eagles’ FA Cup (1959), Charity/Community Shield (1978), Championship
  playoff trophy (2022) and Full Members’ Cup – both Simod and ZDS varieties
  (1989, 1992) – and raise them a handful of League Cups (1979, 1989, 1990). Jim
  adds: “Forest were also victorious at the Wembley-held Football League
  Centenary Tournament in 1988 but, as they weren’t full-length matches, some
  uncharitable types may not wish to count it.” Chelsea have also won five
  trophies at Wembley: FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield, Full Members’ Cup …
  and the League South Cup in 1945. “Chelsea beat Millwall 2-0 in front of a
  crowd of 90,000,” writes Julian Croker. “Eight of the team were actually guest
  players registered to other clubs.” Tom Solano nominates West Ham, whose five
  trophies were the Football League War Cup, FA Cup, Charity Shield, Cup
  Winners’ Cup and Championship playoff. Sadly, we can’t count the 1966 World
  Cup, won by a Hammers-heavy England at Wembley. More musical company for
  Vincent In the Knowledge last week we looked at footballers whose names were
  song titles, a question inspired by CMAT’s Vincent Kompany. Thanks to the
  dozens of you – we had no idea there were so many readers – who sent in some
  of the songs we’d missed. We’ve included links for the most
  popular/interesting ones, with the rest rounded up at the bottom. Thiago Silva
  – Dave ft AJ Tracey George Best – The Wedding Present This is an album rather
  than a song The Scent of Roy Keane – SHLUG Hamish (the Goalie) – Michael Marra
  A tribute to Dundee United’s Hamish McAlpine, covered here by – yep – Leo
  Sayer Bob Wilson, Anchorman – Half Man, Half Biscuit Roger Milla – Pepe Kalle
  “It’s been my ringtone for years,” writes Billy. “Nothing better.” Ich, Roque
  – Sportfreunde Stiller “Roque Santa Cruz even stars in the video,” writes
  Jonas Jessen. The Ballad of Paul Tierney – Lonely Tourist “Includes the
  glorious lines: ‘The gaffer wants a word with you / We’re sending you on loan
  to Crewe’,” says Declan Kehoe. God’s Footballer – Billy Bragg (about Peter
  Knowles) Strachan – The Hitchers Zola – Wonder Villains “The man himself
  appears in the video!” writes Meabh in Belfast. We’ve rounded up the rest
  below, splitting them by position to avoid one never-ending list of songs
  we’ll possibly never hear anyway. Goalkeepers Kasey Keller – Barcelona | Edwin
  van der Sar – Dackelblut Defenders Titus Bramble – Kruz Leone and Duppy |
  Julian Dicks, the Terminator – Flat Back Four | Bobby Moore Was Innocent –
  Serious Drinking | Joey Jones – The Declan Swans | Sliding In (Like McGrain) –
  Big Wednesday | Nice One Cyril – Cockerel Chorus Midfielders Declan Rice –
  ODUMODUBLVCK | Paul Scholes – Yukari Fresh | (Jamie) Jamie Pollock –
  International Strike Force | Dele – Taco Hemingway | Bakayoko – Taco Hemingway
  | Roy Keane – Brame and Hamo | Gary Speed – Lars Vaular Forwards Romário –
  Depth Charge | #RiyadMahrez – RK ft Sofiane &amp; Hornet La Frappe | Ashley
  Barnes – Bacchus | Charlie George on Super 8 – Flyscreen | Mario Balotelli –
  Ruff Sqwad | Wayne Rooney – Johnny Flynn &amp; The Sussex Wit | Johnny Rep –
  Mickey 3D | Drogba (Joanna) – Afro B | Hitti-litti Litmanen – Martti Servo |
  Messi – Neo Pistea | Kubala – Joan Manuel Serrat | Robin Friday – Mirror
  Pictures | When Robin Friday went to Cardiff – The Deckchairs | My Friend
  Cubilas (sic) – Badly Drawn Boy | Riquelme – Lukid | Eric Cantona Stomp –
  Superpunk | Johnny G (The Guidetti Song) – Badpojken ft Frida Green | Bergkamp
  – Midfield General Manager Jurgen – Scorcher ft D Double E Finally, Brendan
  Herron comes bearing information about an entire album of songs about
  footballers. “A couple of years back, a Belgian DJ (and amateur footballer) in
  Berlin by the name of Gratts asked each of his fellow DJ mates to contribute a
  track to a compilation album. There’s more background on this Bandcamp page.
  And here is the track list in full: Paco Buyo Tony Yeboah Tony Vairelles The
  Flying Dutchman Ik West Het, Philippe Albert O Fenomeno Discorentin Martins
  Romário’s Pants Gheorghe Boy George Best Clayton Blackmore We’ll be honest, we
  did not expect to be finishing a section on songs named after the footballers
  with the words “Clayton” and “Blackmore”. Knowledge archive “On Sunday Scott
  Brown, Celtic midfielder and Scotland captain, scored against Scott Brown,
  Aberdeen goalkeeper,” wrote Paul Reilly in 2015. “Are there any other
  instances of a player scoring past his namesake?” As Scott Walden emailed to
  point out, in 2012-13 Gloucester City had the pleasing combination at the back
  of goalkeeper Mike Green and central defender Mike Green. Confusion was always
  likely to be a risk and it came to a calamitous head in September in an FA Cup
  second qualifying round fixture against Thatcham Town. Four minutes before the
  break, the Tigers were 1-0 and cruising. Then disaster struck. The Gloucester
  Citizen picks up the tale: “[Jack] Coventry worked some space on the left but
  his cross looked to be nothing more than a speculative effort. However,
  left-back Green and Matt Coupe got their wires crossed in trying to clear and
  the former poked out a foot and sent the ball past his goalkeeper and into the
  net.” A bad day for Mike Green and Mike Green ended well however, with
  Gloucester running out 2-1 winners. Can you help? “Seven of the nine matches
  in Ligue 1 last weekend finished 1-0,” notes Liam Togher. “That’s 78% of the
  games. Has there ever been a more common instance of one specific scoreline in
  a single gameweek?” “Shelbourne and Linfield meet in the Conference League
  tomorrow, just over a month after they played each other in Champions League
  qualifying. Has this happened before? If so, who were the first teams to play
  each other in two different European competitions in the same season?” asks
  Mad Mac. “Every member of Tottenham’s starting XI in the Uefa Super Cup
  represented a different nationality: Italy, Austria, Argentina, the
  Netherlands, Spain, Uruguay, Portugal, England, Senegal, Ghana and Brazil. Add
  Lucas Bergvall for Sweden, Mathys Tel (and several PSG players) for France,
  players representing Morocco, Ecuador, Georgia and South Korea turning out for
  PSG, and unused subs from Russia, Czechia, Wales and Croatia. I make that 17
  nationalities on the pitch and 21 in total. Is this the most nationally
  diverse football match of all time?” wonders Jack Hayward. “While the league
  table on gameweek one is pretty meaningless, I do like the anomaly of a team
  who hasn’t played yet being comfortably mid-table with zero points. The
  question is, how long into a season has it ever been where the bottom three
  failed to score any points, so hypothetically a team who hadn’t played any
  games at all would still be outside the relegation zone?” wonders James
  Rowland. Mail us with your questions and answers
