  Tommy: The Good. The Bad. The Fury 9pm, BBC Three Tommy Fury – half-brother of
  Tyson – has had “the worst year of my life”. Last August, Molly-Mae Hague
  publicly announced their breakup five years after meeting on Love Island and
  having baby Bambi together. It forced him to reassess his relationship with
  alcohol; the couple are now reunited. Good for him! But this fly-on-the-wall
  series is pretty uneventful until things finally spice up with a hilariously
  pathetic verbal spat between men at a pre-match press conference. Hollie
  Richardson The Big Pound Shop Swap 8pm, Channel 4 More from Denise Van Outen’s
  series in which she examines the pointless conundrum: could you swap the
  luxury supermarket for a weekly shop at the discount store? The Osbornes put
  it to the test this week, and they’ve got a big kids’ party to buy supplies
  for. Uh oh. HR The Great British Sewing Bee 9pm, BBC One “How hard can it be?
  Just make things smaller …” The remaining sewers are optimistic for children’s
  week as they start by making dungarees. For the final task, they need to
  create an outfit inspired by what the young models want to be when they grow
  up – including a beekeeper, a politician and a circus ringmaster. HR In Flight
  9pm, Channel 4 The hairbuns are ginormous, the lipstick undefeatable and the
  anxiety never-ending as this hammy flight attendant thriller continues. Jo
  (Katherine Kelly) is busy juggling blackmailers’ demands and efforts to get
  her son out of prison when she finds out she is due to become a grandmother.
  Hannah J Davies Pompeii: Life in the City With Dan Snow 9pm, Channel 5 The
  final episode of a series that has proved that life in the Roman city was
  anything but idyllic. Dan Snow and Kate Lister explore law and order, Pompeii
  style. Muggings and street fights were surprisingly common, despite horrific
  punishments that included crucifixion and being placed in a sack full of wild
  animals. Phil Harrison Resident Alien 10pm, Sky Max After his lunar jailbreak,
  Harry (Alan Tudyk) is back on Earth but stuck in doughy human form with zero
  access to his alien superpowers – hardly ideal when there is a killer Mantid
  on the loose. But while season four of this offbeat sci-fi has ramped up the
  peril, there is thankfully still room for slapstick and general silliness.
  Graeme Virtue Film choice And Then We Danced (Levan Akin, 2019), 1.50am,
  Channel 4 “There is no sex in Georgian dance!” The strictures of tradition –
  choreographically and sexually – come down heavily on Merab (an affecting
  Levan Gelbakhiani), a student dancer at the Georgian National Ensemble, where
  a “masculine” performance style is the rule. His attraction to new boy/rival
  Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), which may be mutual, further complicates his
  feelings about his art and life. Levan Akin’s 2019 film – do check out his
  more recent trans drama Crossing – is a tender, troubling coming-of-age tale
  set in a world where difference is only tolerated at the margins of society.
  Simon Wardell Hi, Mom! (Brian De Palma, 1970), 3.10am, Talking Pictures TV
  This early Brian De Palma effort from 1970 shows the New York-based director
  playing around with some of his influences (Godard, Hitchcock) in a lively if
  slightly scattergun satire. Robert De Niro – himself not fully formed as an
  actor – plays a voyeuristic film-maker trying to make a movie by spying on his
  neighbours in the apartment block opposite. This devolves into a bizarre
  mockumentary about a radical theatre group staging an experience called Be
  Black, Baby, which features paint and an education in racial inequality. SW
  Live sport The Hundred Cricket: Trent Rockets Women v Manchester Originals
  Women 2.45pm, BBC Two. The men’s match follows at 6pm. Tennis: US Open
  10.15pm, Sky Sports Main Event Day one of the mixed doubles competition.
