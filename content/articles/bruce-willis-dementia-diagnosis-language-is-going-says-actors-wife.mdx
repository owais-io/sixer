  Bruce Willis’s brain is “failing him” and his “language is going”, his wife,
  Emma Heming Willis, has revealed, more than two years since the actor was
  diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. “Bruce is still very mobile. Bruce is
  in really great health overall, you know,” Heming Willis told Diane Sawyer in
  an ABC special on Tuesday. “It’s just his brain that is failing him. The
  language is going. We’ve learned to adapt and we have a way of communicating
  with him, which is just a different way.” In 2022, Willis’s family announced
  that the Die Hard and Sixth Sense movie star would be retiring from acting
  after being diagnosed with aphasia – a brain disorder that leads to difficulty
  with language or speech. “For someone who was very talkative and very engaged,
  he was just a little more quiet and, when the family would get together, he
  would just melt a little bit,” Heming Willis told ABC of her husband’s early
  symptoms. “He felt a little removed, a little cold, not like Bruce who was
  very warm and very affectionate. To go the complete opposite of that was
  alarming and scary.” A year after his aphasia diagnosis, Willis received
  another diagnosis for frontotemporal dementia. “While this is painful, it is a
  relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” Willis’s family said at the time in
  a joint statement including his daughters, his wife, and his ex-wife, Demi
  Moore. When Heming Willis first learned the diagnosis, “I was so panicked and
  I just remembering hearing it and not hearing anything else,” she said. “It
  was like I was freefalling.” Heming Willis said there are still times where
  her husband – now 70 – reveals a “spark” of his buoyant personality. “We still
  get those days,” she told Sawyer. “Not days, but moments. It’s his laugh. He
  has such a hearty laugh. And sometimes you’ll get that twinkle in his eye or
  that spark. And I just get transported. It’s just hard to see because as
  quickly as those moments appear, then it goes.” Heming Willis and Willis
  married in 2009 and have two daughters together. Her book about caring for
  Willis – titled Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope and Yourself on the
  Caregiving Path – will be published on 9 September.
