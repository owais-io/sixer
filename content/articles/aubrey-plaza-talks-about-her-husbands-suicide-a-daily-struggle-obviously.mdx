  The actor Aubrey Plaza has opened up about the suicide of her husband,
  director Jeff Baena, who died in January. The White Lotus and Parks and
  Recreation star was speaking to Amy Poehler for her podcast Good Hang when she
  was asked how she was doing during “a terrible, terrible, tragic year”. “Right
  in this very, very present moment, I feel happy to be with you,” Plaza said.
  “Overall, I’m here and I’m functioning. I feel really grateful to be moving
  through the world. I think I’m OK, but it’s like a daily struggle, obviously.”
  Baena, who directed Plaza in the comedies Life After Beth and The Little
  Hours, killed himself at the age of 47 at his Los Angeles home. At the time, a
  joint statement from Plaza and his family called it “an unimaginable tragedy”.
  In her interview with Poehler, Plaza used the Apple sci-fi horror The Gorge as
  a “really dumb analogy” to describe the aftermath. “It’s like an alien movie
  with Miles Teller,” she said. “In the movie, there’s a cliff on one side and a
  cliff on the other side and there’s a gorge in between and it’s filled with
  all these monster people that are trying to get them. I swear when I watched
  it, I was like, ‘That what this feels like, what my grief is like – or what
  grief could be like.’ At all times there’s like a giant ocean of awfulness
  that’s like right there, and I can see it. And sometimes, I just want to dive
  into it and be in it. And then sometimes, I just look at it. And then
  sometimes, I’m just trying to get away from it. But it’s always there. It’s
  just always there. And the monster people are trying to get me like Miles
  Teller.” The pair met in 2011 and married in 2021. In an obituary for the
  Guardian, Ryan Gilbey praised Baena’s “enjoyably twisted” movies. Baena also
  co-wrote I Heart Huckabees with David O Russell, and his final film was the
  dark comedy Spin Me Round, starring Plaza and Alison Brie. Plaza’s film roles
  also include Ingrid Goes West and Emily the Criminal, and she can next be seen
  in Ethan Coen’s comedy Honey Don’t. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be
