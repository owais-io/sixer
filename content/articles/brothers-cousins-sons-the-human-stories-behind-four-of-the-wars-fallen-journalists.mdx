  Mohammed al-Khaldi, 36 Journalist “My brother was a very distinguished
  journalist. Thank God he didn’t have children, as losing a father is very
  difficult. He was single and never married due to the difficult living
  conditions in Gaza,” says Anas al-Khaldi. Khaldi was killed four days before
  his 37th birthday. “My brother studied Arabic language and media at al-Azhar
  University and had worked in journalism since 2010. He loved his profession.
  “From the beginning of his journalistic career, and during previous wars,
  Mohammed always absolutely refused to film body parts or people screaming. He
  would tell me that his heart could not bear such pain. “My brother was very
  intelligent, brilliant and pure-hearted. This inspired him to leave the field
  of preparing humanitarian stories and move into investigative journalism. He
  began as a reporter with the Palestinian newspaper Dunya Al-Watan. He
  developed his skills and started filming humanitarian stories. “In 2019, he
  received an award from the Coalition for Accountability and Integrity (Aman)
  for an investigation on unemployment in Gaza. “Despite the financial burden of
  investigative reporting, which he could barely afford, he was determined to
  create content on social media. Sometimes, he had to borrow money to complete
  his work, repaying the debt after he was paid for his investigations. “He was
  passionate about exposing fake news and clarifying the facts, so he joined the
  Misbar platform to verify news, investigate facts and expose lies in the
  public sphere. “He often told me he wanted to travel abroad and develop his
  content. He shifted his work from political to scientific, gaining recognition
  on YouTube and Instagram. He always sought to improve his skills. “My family,
  including Mohammed, were displaced from Jabalia in northern Gaza to Rafah in
  the south by order of the Israeli occupation. Mohammed wanted to continue his
  journalism and had received generous offers from international news agencies,
  but we feared for his safety. Since the beginning of the war, the occupation
  had been targeting journalists and their families. “After some time, driven by
  his sense of responsibility towards Gaza and its people – and with Israel
  preventing international journalists from entering – Mohammed decided to
  convey our voice to the world in a way that could also be described as
  creative and engaging. “For example, he would compare life in Gaza – marked by
  tragedy, displacement and starvation – with life outside Gaza, producing
  videos that shared Gaza’s story in his own unique style. “Like all journalists
  in Gaza, Mohammed suffered from hunger, displacement and separation from his
  family. He lost a significant amount of weight. He was forced to flee several
  times – first from Jabalia to Rafah, then, after the Rafah invasion, to Deir
  al-Balah, and later to the eastern Gaza Strip. “Eventually, he took shelter in
  the tent near al-Shifa hospital with fellow journalists. This was one of the
  few areas with internet access and he spent much of his time there. “I would
  ask him if he needed anything, but he would always reply, ‘Don’t worry,
  brother.’ “Once his colleague asked him what he wanted to do when the war
  ended. He answered, ‘I want to eat shawarma with extra tahini.’ “Mohammed felt
  deep compassion for children. When he filmed starving children waiting in line
  for food, he would try to help them. He often posted the contact information
  of victims in need of financial or food assistance on his Instagram account,
  in case individuals or organisations could help. “The last time I spoke to my
  brother was about two days before Israel killed him. I offered to buy him a
  tent for privacy but he refused, saying he wanted to remain with his
  colleagues. We spoke about his dreams and ambitions, and he told me he wanted
  to travel after the war ended and continue his content creation. “I am proud
  of my brother – of his martyrdom, his good reputation as a journalist, and his
  kind heart. He was a skilled journalist, but he was a wonderful human being.”
  *** Anas al-Sharif, 28 Journalist “On the few occasions when Anas was able to
  visit us while covering the Israeli massacres, he would rush into my mother’s
  arms. He was her youngest son, the one she pampered the most,” says Mahmoud
  al-Sharif, Anas’s brother. “My brother fulfilled his mission and his duty,
  despite the constant threats he faced from the Israeli army. “Anas never
  longed for death. On the contrary, he dreamed of an end to the genocide and of
  living in safety with his wife, two children and mother. He dreamed of
  travelling – to Egypt, to Qatar to meet his colleagues at Al Jazeera
  headquarters. “He had never left Gaza – not even once in his life. He often
  spoke of what he wanted to do when the genocide ended: to respond to
  invitations from around the world to share his testimony, to speak for Gaza’s
  bereaved before global audiences. He also dreamed of visiting Saudi Arabia to
  perform umrah and hajj [pilgrimages]. “Anas yearned for calm, for an end to
  war, and for the chance to finally travel. “What people saw on social media –
  that he was preparing to die – was the result of repeated threats from Israel
  and calls from Avichay Adraee, the head of the Israel Defense Forces’ Arab
  media unit. “Like all Palestinians, he could not afford to show weakness. He
  was known for his courage and steadfastness, even during the darkest days.
  “Anas appealed to the world to stop the massacres. Since the first days of the
  war, he carried the voice of Gaza to the global stage, yet no one listened.
  “He was cheerful, kind-hearted and gentle. Everyone who knew him loved him. He
  treated his colleagues with dignity and respect. Our loss is immeasurable, and
  no one can fully comprehend his absence. “He had slept at the Baptist
  [al-Ahli] hospital until assassination threats grew more serious, then he
  pitched a tent away from the crowds near al-Shifa hospital. He feared being
  targeted but even more, he feared others would be killed alongside him. “Forty
  days before his death, he managed to see his wife and children for only a
  single day. One report that enraged the Israeli army was his coverage of
  killings of Palestinian civilians waiting for aid at American [US and
  Israeli-backed] distribution points. Anas went to the Zikim area to
  investigate, taking the risk on his own initiative, without being asked by Al
  Jazeera, and the network was astonished by his courage. “As famine deepened in
  Gaza, he appeared on Al Jazeera in tears. He wept for the starving children
  and elderly people. People sought refuge in his tent, asking for his help.
  “Under siege and starvation, he often felt powerless. His tears flowed from
  his grief for the reality his people endured. “Anas held a bachelor’s degree
  in journalism from al-Azhar University and had aspired to pursue a master’s
  degree. Before the war, he worked as a photographer and began submitting
  photos and videos to news agencies, including Al Jazeera. After Israel
  intensified the siege and cut communications in December 2023, Anas managed to
  obtain a sim card and connect with the channel by phone. Shortly afterwards,
  Al Jazeera recruited him as a correspondent. “One of the most painful events
  that shaped him was the killing of our father on 11 December 2023. After
  threats to bomb our home, we evacuated. My father, however, said he would
  finish his prayer and then join us. Israel struck before he could leave. That
  tragedy became a driving force for Anas to raise Gaza’s voice. “He lost many
  friends, colleagues and family. He carried the coffin of his fellow Al Jazeera
  correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and was devastated by his killing. He was
  equally broken when the cameraman Fadi al-Wahidi was left paralysed by Israeli
  fire. “In anguish, he told me: ‘I was with him. I couldn’t protect him.’ For
  nearly three months, he worked relentlessly to secure Fadi’s transfer to Qatar
  and only once Fadi left for treatment did Anas’s mental health begin to
  recover. “With the killing of Anas and his colleagues, Gaza lost four
  prominent voices who had documented suffering with courage and truth. “Israel
  claimed my brother was a Hamas member. He was not affiliated with any
  political party. Then they accused him of being a Hamas fighter. Anyone could
  see that he was not a soldier. Israel killed him for one reason: to silence
  Gaza’s voice. That is why he was targeted. “My last conversation with Anas was
  just hours before his death. We spoke about family and about Israel’s plan to
  invade Gaza and force people south. Anas vowed he would never leave; he would
  rather be martyred than uprooted. International organisations had offered to
  help him evacuate but he could not abandon the people of Gaza, who felt
  strength in his voice. He told me he would travel after the war ended, not
  before. “Anas left his will with a trusted friend outside Gaza, fearing none
  of us would survive to share it. In it, he entrusted the cause of Palestine to
  the world and urged humanity to continue carrying the message. He entrusted
  his family, his wife, his children and his mother to the world’s conscience.”
  *** Mohammed Noufal, 29 Journalist Ibrahim Noufal, a photographer, is the
  brother of Mohammed, who was an Al Jazeera cameraman “The last words Mohammed
  said to me were: ‘Go sleep at home. Don’t sleep in our tent. I don’t want our
  father to die grieving over losing both of us.’ Hours later, Israel killed
  him, along with my friends Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and Ibrahim Zaher,
  in a tent near al-Shifa hospital – where I had just been. “Israel killed my
  brother on 10 August 2025. It killed my mother, Munira, 57, on 22 June 2025,
  and my brother Omar, 33, on 7 October 2024. I am exhausted by loss and grief.
  “Mohammed, known as ‘Abu Yahya,’ was gentle and kind, and he was my mother’s
  most beloved child. He loved cooking and before the war, he always invited
  friends to our house and prepared delicious food for us. He spent most of his
  time with family and friends. “He was devout in his faith and consistent in
  his prayers. He grew figs, grapes, peaches, cared for lemon and olive trees,
  and even planted sugar cane on our land. He loved life. He was planning to get
  married. “Mohammed was only one year older than me but I always turned to him.
  He was my refuge, my support in this world. “Like everyone in Gaza, Mohammed
  suffered greatly, displaced many times and enduring bombing, hunger and
  deprivation. On 30 October 2023, Israel bombed the place where we were
  sheltering in Jabalia. “I was pulled alive from the rubble. Mohammed was
  thrown on to a neighbour’s rooftop, breaking his pelvis. We lost 11 members of
  our extended family that day. “During his treatment, I stayed with Mohammed in
  the Indonesian hospital until 22 November 2023, when Israeli forces stormed
  the hospital and bombs rained down. Anas [al-Sharif] and I rushed to a tent in
  the courtyard to save our filming equipment, but I could not return to my
  brother inside due to the heavy shelling and gunfire. Anas and I were forced
  to evacuate toward Jabalia. I felt guilty leaving Mohammed behind. “Later, my
  father urged me to move south because the situation in the north was
  unbearable. I took my sister and her children and left for Deir al-Balah. The
  journey was terrifying. But all I could think about was Mohammed, my soulmate.
  “Despite his severe injuries, Mohammed somehow managed to leave the hospital.
  He found a crutch and walked until he reached Jabalia. Mohammed remained by
  Anas’s side. He was his assistant, his companion. Despite the threats against
  Anas, Mohammed refused to leave him. “The genocide has claimed all of
  Mohammed’s friends – his childhood companions, his schoolmates and his
  neighbours. I have photographed countless martyrs; the hardest moments were
  when I held my mother’s body – the first I embraced – and my brother
  Mohammed’s. “Displacement separated us for months, but when the truce allowed
  families to return north, I went back immediately. Hugging Mohammed again was
  one of the happiest moments of my life. Yet he was thin, frail and starving –
  like everyone in northern Gaza. “On the day of his assassination, I was with
  him and the others nearly all day. I had bought some overpriced vegetables
  from the market and Mohammed made a salad. We sat joking about the threats
  Avichay Adraee had made against Anas. We laughed a lot that day, trying to
  believe those threats were not real. “Anas and the others weren’t my brothers
  by blood [but] they were my brothers in every other way. We grew up together.
  “That night, I wanted to sleep in their tent, but Mohammed refused. I went to
  collect my clothes from the laundry, planning to come back and have dinner
  with them. On the way back, I met some friends who insisted I sit for tea. I
  stayed about half an hour. Then I heard a rocket strike. “With no internet, I
  could not confirm where it landed, but my heart told me it had struck
  Mohammed’s tent. Soon, the calls began. People said Anas was killed, but
  Mohammed’s fate was unknown. On my way to the hospital, I got another call:
  Mohammed was gone. “My father called … I couldn’t tell him the truth. I said I
  didn’t know and that I was on my way to al-Shifa. When I arrived, I found my
  brother’s body. His head was torn apart, his arms severed. “It was the deepest
  pain I’ve ever felt. In that instant, I lost not only my brother but also my
  friends, all at once. “I put my brother in the morgue fridge and told my
  father and sisters not to come, because the bombing was insane after the
  killing of Anas, Mohammed and our friends, and there was no one left to cover
  the news. “I slept in the morgue while my brother was in the fridge. The next
  day, I buried him. I asked that the shroud not be opened and that no one see
  him … I wanted people to remember him by his beautiful face and smile.” ***
  Mohammed Qreiqeh, 33 Journalist Fayez Qreiqeh is the cousin of the Al Jazeera
  journalist Mohammed Qreiqeh “Mohammed was an only child, he lived his entire
  life with his mother, as his father passed away shortly after his birth. He
  studied journalism and media, graduating with a bachelor’s degree from the
  Islamic University of Gaza. “From a young age, Mohammed was eloquent, well
  spoken. During the 2008 war, he was always around journalists, observing their
  work and learning from them. “He worked as a freelancer for several news
  channels before the war. Mohammed was cheerful, well mannered and had a
  wonderful sense of humour. Whenever I felt distressed, I would sit with him,
  and he would always manage to lift my spirits. “He was a devoted son to his
  mother. He always said that his mother, wife and two children were his whole
  life. He lived for them. “Mohammed was born and raised in Shuja’iyya in Gaza
  City, to which he was deeply attached. Like all Palestinians in Gaza he
  suffered displacement, loss and starvation. When al-Shifa hospital was
  invaded, Mohammed and his elderly, ailing mother had been sheltering there.
  The Israeli forces separated men from women, ordering the men to head south.
  “Mohammed refused to leave without his mother, desperately trying to stay
  close to her but as the siege dragged on, he could not find her. After 14
  agonising days, the occupation forces withdrew and he found her body
  decomposing in a stairwell. “Losing his mother devastated him, especially as
  his wife and son and daughter had already been displaced to southern Gaza. “So
  Mohammed was left alone, his mental health shattered. Yet he continued working
  as an independent journalist until he officially joined Al Jazeera, after the
  assassination of [the journalist] Ismail al-Ghoul. “He was tormented by his
  inability to provide food for his children due to the starvation. Mohammed was
  not used to sleeping in the journalists’ tent. But on that night of his
  assassination, he was standing at the tent’s entrance preparing to leave when
  the Israeli missile struck, killing him instantly. “When I heard of Anas
  al-Sharif’s assassination, I never imagined that I would also have just lost
  Mohammed – my cousin, my friend. I knew he rarely stayed in that tent. “His
  loss is unbearable, not only for our family but for all of Gaza. He was
  beloved, kind and ready to help anyone in need.”
