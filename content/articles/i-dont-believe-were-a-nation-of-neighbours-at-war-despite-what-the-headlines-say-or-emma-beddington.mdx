  I don’t believe we’re a nation of neighbours at war – despite what the

  A glance at recent headlines suggests neighbourliness isn’t exactly in
  fashion: five-year “war” over “untrimmed” hedge; wellness guru accused of
  blocking neighbours’ access; shared hedge court “battle”; “fine for noisy
  rooster leaves neighbours cock-a-hoop”. In March, the Times reported a surge
  in litigation over boundary disputes; in June, the housing ombudsman told the
  BBC that antisocial behaviour complaints had doubled in the past five years.
  But I don’t believe we’re all living in a simmering neighbour grievance stew,
  threatening to boil over any second. Almost all of us live in intimate
  proximity on this small island and vanishingly few cohabitations end in
  complaints and court. We ranked fourth of 24 countries in trusting our
  neighbours in the World Values Survey and while the sense of belonging to our
  neighbourhoods has declined slightly since Covid-19, it is steady at about
  60%. Most people try to be decent, tolerating barbecue smoke, straggly privet
  or escaped tortoises laying waste to their gardens. My neighbours go much
  further than that: this summer they have given us mountains of cherries,
  tomatoes and plants, lent us a trailer and done some chicken sitting. I don’t
  offer much in comparison, but I have fed a cat, taken out bins, offered
  lettuces and witnessed signatures – the basics of neighbourliness. Or should
  that be “neighbouring”? Writing in the Financial Times, the author Tiffany
  Watt Smith suggests the word is a better fit for how we live in this unchosen,
  happenstance proximity: “A more neutral verb (much like ‘parenting’) that
  emphasises what we do, rather than who we are.” The idea of “neighbouring” as
  an action, not an identity, resonates, and how you neighbour is a product of
  circumstance (plus, of course, personalities). My neighbouring history is
  mixed: there was a family of uptight brass players so annoyed by my
  laissez-faire lawn maintenance that they sent one of their chinos-wearing sons
  round to mow; in another street, a nocturnal saxophonist improvised
  experimental accompaniments to Johnny Hallyday tracks after midnight, but also
  threatened to bury my husband in the garden when he got the lawnmower out. In
  a Paris apartment with a newborn, a toddler and terrible acoustics, we were
  the meat in a multi-generational complaint sandwich: five minutes of crying
  (the baby’s, mine was equally heartfelt but quieter) roused both the
  twentysomething below, who threatened to report us to the “authorities”, and
  the irascible retiree above, thumping with his cane. But other neighbours
  threaded connection and kindness through the long or short times we shared
  space. Especially Maria, our neighbour in our first flat. How else would I
  ever have met Maria? I’m so glad I did. Italian, widowed, mid-70s, Maria lived
  downstairs with her pampered cat, Bambi, a fur ball fed solely on organic
  chicken mini fillets and “special” Harrods milk. Absurdly energetic, she still
  worked in Soho’s trattorias, stumping home at midnight with the takings zipped
  inside her boot. Her speech patterns and anecdotes were richly strange,
  featuring murder (decapitation recurred alarmingly), cameos from the likes of
  George Best and L Ron Hubbard and decades-long grudges. Her expressions –
  “pieces and pieces” for “this and that” and “Fatty Bongo” (her nickname for
  Bambi, and others) – instantly entered my personal lexicon. Maria
  “neighboured” hard: she fed us, gave us gifts (unwanted, but that was
  immaterial) and took us out, usually to Italian restaurants where she was
  feared and respected equally. Once, memorably, she took us to a louche Mayfair
  casino where we discovered she was a regular. Later, she marched me down
  Edgware Road, pregnant, to buy frilly OTT baby clothes for our firstborn. I
  could only offer “pieces and pieces” in return: sourcing Bambi’s expensive
  rider, errands, an appreciative ear for her stories. Eight years later we
  left, with a final parting gift of a gigantic crystal basket. I’m sad that we
  didn’t stay in touch (my stepmother did for a while, so I know Maria adored
  the chaps who replaced us – they even shared a dog). That’s “neighbouring”, I
  suppose: we enter each other’s lives then leave, hopefully a little richer,
  not in crystal and infant sailor suits but in perspective; openness to
  connection, curiosity. Of course, your next neighbour could be a pass-agg note
  leaver, a pyromaniac or 3am dubstep aficionado. But what if they aren’t? •
