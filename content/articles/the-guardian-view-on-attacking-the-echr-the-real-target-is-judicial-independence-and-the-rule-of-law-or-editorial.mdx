  Most British citizens have little contact with human rights law, which is as
  it should be in a mature democracy. Widespread anxiety about basic freedoms is
  a feature of more repressive regimes. Many people will only have heard of the
  European convention on human rights (ECHR) in the context of the last
  Conservative government’s failed attempts to dispatch asylum seekers to
  Rwanda, or in a handful of incidents where convicted criminals or terrorist
  suspects have avoided deportation to jurisdictions where they might face
  inhumane treatment. Such cases are amplified by politicians who are hostile to
  the whole apparatus of human rights law. The Strasbourg court that adjudicates
  on breaches of the ECHR is denounced as an enemy of British sovereignty. Those
  attacks will continue for as long as asylum, and small-boats traffic on the
  Channel in particular, are salient political issues – for the foreseeable
  future, in other words. Labour’s new “one-in, one-out” scheme for returning
  seaborne refugees is more robust in legal and humanitarian terms than the
  failed Tory method. France is a safe country. That won’t stop critics accusing
  the government of failing to control the border and citing international human
  rights conventions as the main impediment to the restoration of law and order.
  Nigel Farage has said he would “get rid of the ECHR” as a day-one priority
  should Reform UK ever form a government. Kemi Badenoch is drifting to the same
  position, albeit with circumspection. The Conservative leader acknowledges
  that peremptory rupture is not straightforward, especially for Northern
  Ireland since European convention rights are woven into the Good Friday
  agreement. Mrs Badenoch has commissioned a report to consider how an ECHR exit
  might be achieved but expressed her personal view that Britain “will likely
  need to leave” because human rights are wielded as a “sword … to attack
  democratic decisions and common sense.” The core argument, for both Mrs
  Badenoch and Mr Farage, is that voters want politicians to expel undesirable
  elements from society but the popular will is being thwarted by unelected
  judges. Human rights, in this conception, are a loophole through which
  criminals and foreign interlopers evade justice. Ideas codified after the
  second world war as foundational principles of a new democratic settlement for
  Europe are recast as attacks on the law-abiding majority. This rhetorical
  subterfuge gets a purchase on public discourse through channels previously
  opened by Brexit. The ECHR is not an EU institution, but the fact of it being
  European in name stirs suspicion that it is an alien imposition. Dispensing
  with human rights obligations would be a necessary step for any government
  seeking to emulate Donald Trump’s programme of detaining and deporting
  migrants without regard for due process. It is not far-fetched to envisage a
  Reform government recreating that model, given Mr Farage’s record of
  admiration for Mr Trump. ECHR rulings are not infallible. A 71-year-old
  institution can reasonably be scrutinised with a view to reform. But that is
  not what its noisiest UK antagonists have in mind. They target the convention
  not because it is a big part of public life, but because it is a minor one and
  poorly understood. It is a soft target in a longer campaign to undermine
  judicial independence, discredit liberal principle and, ultimately, degrade
  the rule of law to the benefit of unaccountable executive power.
