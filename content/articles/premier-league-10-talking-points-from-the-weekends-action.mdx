  Amorim struggling to see off also-rans Ruben Amorim has been a highly
  successful Manchester United manager against continental opposition and
  promoted Premier League clubs. He’s been respectable against the top teams in
  England, with a win at the Etihad, a draw at Anfield and a win on penalties
  against Arsenal. But he’s been hopeless when faced with opponents from
  mid-table. Last season, after taking over in November, Amorim supervised 14
  league games against clubs that ended up between seventh and 17th. United won
  two, drew two and lost 10, scraping eight points out of a possible 42. One of
  those two wins was at Craven Cottage, a streaky 1-0. Here, again, they needed
  luck to take the lead as Leny Yoro got away with a two-hands push on Calvin
  Bassey; this time they blew it, and they couldn’t complain. United had been
  the better team for 20 minutes, Fulham for about 75. Tim de Lisle Match
  report: Fulham 1-1 Manchester United Grealish puts his best foot forward David
  Moyes’ instruction to Jack Grealish was fairly simple but will have come as a
  blessed relief to the on-loan Everton winger after two seasons of torment at
  Manchester City. “I just want Jack to take people on and be positive, he has
  great ability to take the ball forward,” said the Everton manager, who hopes
  to improve his options on the opposite flank this week with the signing of
  Tyler Dibling from Southampton. “The boy who we saw playing for Manchester
  City in the year they won the treble is a really exciting player. I hope we
  can get him back. He didn’t want to come off after 60 minutes. No chance. He
  wanted it. He probably feels he has something to prove.” Grealish proved he
  can still shape Premier League games with a sparkling home debut for Everton.
  The 29-year-old last produced an assist for City in September 2024 but
  delivered two to mark Hill Dickinson Stadium’s grand Premier League opening.
  Questions about his appetite are starting to disappear. Andy Hunter Match
  report: Everton 2-0 Brighton Glasner’s tactics continue to bear fruit Amid all
  the talk about Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 shape and its pluses and minuses, it’s
  often forgotten that there is another devotee of the formation in the Premier
  League, one whose side seem rather more comfortable in the formation. At
  Crystal Palace, as at Eintracht Frankfurt, Oliver Glasner has constructed a
  side who seem more than the sum of their parts, more comfortable playing on
  the break perhaps, but a reliable and consistent Premier League presence.
  Although they ran out of steam late on against Forest, Palace’s goal showed
  how the system can work and how reliant it is on the wing-backs. Tyrick
  Mitchell, the left wing-back, got forward, crossed and, although the ball was
  cleared, it was worked to the right. Daniel Muñoz was in an advanced position
  and, with Forest’s rearguard having been dragged the other way, found himself
  unmarked. His cross was then turned in by Ismaïla Sarr for the opener.
  Jonathan Wilson Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 Nottingham Forest Richarlison
  proving worth for Frank After his two-goal showing against Burnley,
  Richarlison was a huge factor again in Tottenham’s fine triumph at Manchester
  City. Having been reportedly touted as a makeweight in the Eberechi Eze deal
  that never was, the Brazilian was in spiky form afterwards when referencing a
  chat with Thomas Frank, the new Spurs manager. “It was very important,” the
  Brazilian striker said. “Since I got here, every time the transfer window
  opens, my name is circled as one who could leave – going back to Brazil or
  wherever. But I’ve always been focused on Tottenham and I’ve never had a
  conversation about leaving. I’m in a good moment. I hope to continue working
  hard and getting the opportunity to give my best. Now I want to be able to
  continue like this and play like this.” Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester
  City 0-2 Tottenham Zubimendi shows Gunners’ new approach Arsenal have a new
  weapon in their armoury this season. Against Leeds, they caused problems with
  an aggressive counterpress. The hosts should have taken the lead when Martín
  Zubimendi, who is supposed to be the deepest midfielder, read an attempt from
  Leeds to play out from the back. Viktor Gyökeres failed to take advantage but
  the ploy soon worked. Zubimendi’s midfield partner Declan Rice was involved,
  stepping in to win possession. Rice’s tackle fed the ball to Zubimendi, who
  was in close attendance. Zubimendi collected and passed to Jurriën Timber, who
  sent Bukayo Saka through to score. It was an encouraging sign for Mikel
  Arteta, and Leeds could not cope with the smothering tactics. Arsenal sat on
  too many 1-0 leads last season. There were too many home draws and dropped
  points from winning positions. Arteta has the toughest defence in the Premier
  League, but his team have to become more assertive if they are to win the
  title. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Arsenal 5-0 Leeds Silva strikes again
  with his changes There are good draws and bad draws. After two games, Fulham
  have two satisfying ones: a pair of 1-1s, away at Brighton and home to
  Manchester United. Drawing with Ruben Amorim’s misfiring team may not sound
  like much, but on United’s previous eight visits to Craven Cottage, Fulham had
  lost every time. This time they went 1-0 down and, just like on the south
  coast, Marco Silva saved the day with a substitution. Rodrigo Muniz got the
  equaliser against Brighton, about as late as he could have. Emile Smith Rowe
  got the equaliser here, about as early as he could have: 90 seconds after
  coming on, he met Alex Iwobi’s cross with a deft finish. It was very Fulham. A
  third of their league goals since the start of last season have come from subs
  – 19 out of 56. Silva is either a genius at in-game management, or not so hot
  when picking his starters. TdL Amorim tells United to ‘grow up’, Fernandes
  says referee triggered penalty miss Emery needs width as Villa lose their edge
  Three statistics from Aston Villa’s defeat at Brentford summed up the
  visitors’ story: 76% possession, 17 shots – their most without scoring in a
  Premier League match since October 2022 – but just two on target. Villa have
  problems in attack and nowhere is that more evident than on either flank. As
  he was for their goalless opener against Newcastle, John McGinn was deployed
  on the right wing, with Morgan Rogers on the other. Both tended to drift
  inside, offering precious little width. Evann Guessand looked lively when he
  came on for his debut, but 15 minutes was insufficient time to work with. The
  Ivorian international cannot be far off a start, based on Villa’s recent
  troubles. Unai Emery is seeking reinforcements over the next week; he needs to
  procure a winger or two, otherwise they will be all too easy to nullify this
  season. Ben Bloom Match report: Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa Iraola keeps cool
  amid turbulent summer Bournemouth have been mined for £200m-plus of talent
  this summer, but to Andoni Iraola’s credit, it is hard to spot the difference
  between last season’s team and this iteration. Bournemouth built on a
  promising performance in defeat at Liverpool with victory at home to Wolves.
  Five new players featured, including the debutant Amine Adli, a £25m purchase
  from Bayer Leverkusen, while Eli Junior Kroupi made another appearance off the
  bench. The hosts were organised if not outstanding, the early signs
  encouraging. Iraola suggested the defender Bafodé Diakité, another of those
  new additions, finished the game stronger than he started. “We’ve had a lot of
  changes,” Iraola said. “Amine and Junior Kroupi were doing the right things
  but not always synchronised. They need to know their teammates and we need to
  know them better. I think the more time we play together, the better we will
  be.” Ben Fisher Match report: Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves Mejbri leads the way for
  grafting Clarets It seems unlikely Burnley’s inevitable relegation battle will
  be based on outplaying other teams. Discipline and graft will be the key
  components of Scott Parker’s plan. Against Sunderland, they enjoyed a healthy
  share of possession but chances were limited. In the knowledge of what his
  team is about, Hannibal Mejbri embodied the work ethic demanded by the home
  fans and his manager. The Tunisian midfielder was relentless in putting
  pressure on opponents, chasing lost causes and generally irritating anyone in
  a black shirt. Often players who come through the Manchester United academy
  are gifted with natural ability, but fall down when it comes to backing it up
  with the effort required to reach the top. Mejbri had to drop down to the
  Championship to kickstart his career after having his path blocked at Old
  Trafford. He looks determined to show he can cope with Premier League
  football, and will be hoping his team can do the same. Will Unwin Match
  report: Burnley 2-0 Sunderland Potter must make Hammers horrible Graham Potter
  wants to move West Ham to a style based on dominant possession, but does not
  have the players to make it work. It is time to go back to basics. West Ham
  were humbled by Sunderland on the opening day and confirmed that they are
  relegation candidates during their pathetic defeat to Chelsea on Friday night.
  The hosts did not run, press or fight. They did not compete. They let crosses
  come into the box and did not defend them. They gave up three soft goals from
  set pieces. They are using a back five but are still easy to break down.
  Potter’s system means their ponderous midfield is outnumbered by three to two.
  The manager needs an urgent rethink after a slow, confused transfer window. He
  somehow has to make West Ham horrible. Forget about trying to play
  entertaining football because this is already a fight for survival. JS Match
  report: West Ham 1-5 Chelsea
