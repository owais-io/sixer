  The Co-op is to challenge takeaway outlets such as Greggs, Pret a Manger and
  Subway with plans for hundreds of small food shops selling hot pizza, fried
  chicken and sandwiches. The first Co-op On The Go store opens in Solihull,
  near Birmingham, on Thursday and 14 more are planned this year, including five
  in London. They will sell ready meals, such as pizzas and lasagne to heat up
  at home, alcoholic and soft drinks, and essentials such as toothpaste and loo
  roll alongside staffed hot food counters and food in heated cabinets. At
  between 600 sq ft and 1,000 sq ft, the stores will be about a quarter of the
  size of a typical Co-op but unlike many convenience stores they will not sell
  cigarettes or vapes. However, the company has developed 35 new products for
  the new format, such as all day-breakfast meal pots and smoked salmon, egg and
  spinach pots. “This isn’t a really small version of a [traditional] Co-op,
  it’s very different in layout and what we are servicing the customer with,”
  said Matt Hood, the boss of the Co-op’s grocery chain, which already has more
  than 2,000 stores. The bitesize outlets will open from 7am to 7pm, closing
  three or four hours earlier than its traditional outlets. Many will then
  operate as “dark stores”, sending out home deliveries of food and groceries
  into the evening. The Co-op already delivers groceries to homes via Deliveroo
  and Uber Eats as well as its own “quick commerce” delivery service and it aims
  to add hot food to that fast-growing business. Hood said the format, inspired
  by similar setups in Japan and China, would help the Co-op grab a bigger slice
  of the breakfast and dinner market alongside its existing strength in lunch
  products such as sandwiches. “This feels ripe for us to step into,” he said.
  Hood said the Co-op already had a 15% share of the UK’s “food to go” market
  and the new format was about taking a bigger share in busy urban locations.
  The first stores are likely to be on high streets but the group is also
  looking at transport hubs, such as train stations, and could inject aspects of
  the new format, such as hot food counters, into some of its existing stores.
  Some small existing stores in busy locations may also be converted into “on
  the go’” stores while others are already operating as “dark stores”. Fewer
  than 100 stores will continue to operate with just one worker at certain times
  of day, despite protests from some workers who say the practice leaves them
  vulnerable to crime, as Hood said this was part of efforts to “continue
  looking at every way I can to keep all shops open and servicing communities”.
  The new format is launching amid fears for the strength of the takeaway food
  market after Greggs, the UK’s biggest bakery, reported a fall in profits this
  week as it said shoppers ate less during the recent heatwaves. Hood said Co-op
  was still seeing “huge growth in our food to go business”, which was driven by
  sandwiches and coffee. He said retailers such as Greggs were “always going to
  be tight on margins and footfall” as they were focused on hot baked products
  and the Co-op was offering something different. The Co-op is attempting to
  bounce back from a serious cyber-attack which affected the availability or
  products in its stores for several weeks and led to the theft of data, such as
  names and addresses, for all 6.5 million of the mutual’s members. Hood said
  that the Co-op was now “fully recovered” in terms of the service available in
  stores but that “a lot of stuff is still happening in the background to make
  sure [the IT] set up is even stronger”. He added: “It has not been something I
  would wish on anybody. It’s been a massive learning curve and we will come
  back out stronger and better than before.”
