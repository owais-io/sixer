  ‘You’re at the start of what might be the best weekend of your life,”
  Manchester’s dance-grooved “pop poet” Antony Szmierek tells a cheering
  audience, capturing the buzz which brings tens of thousands of teenagers (and
  older) to Leeds festival (and its Reading counterpart). The former rock
  festival is a post-GCSE rite of passage, a place for many to don a daft hat,
  wear as little as possible, toast results or drown sorrows. Two years ago,
  Szmeriek – imagine the Streets’ Mike Skinner with a ’tache and trackies – was
  a special needs teacher before becoming a dazzling wordsmith, so draws on his
  backstory (and gets another cheer) when he tells the kid in the front row who
  failed all his exams: “It doesn’t matter. You will be someone.” Other hits
  include Skye Newman’s raw soul, dance producer Sammy Virji and besuited,
  sunglasses-wearing New York one-man electronic band Harrison Smith AKA the
  Dare, whose brilliantly jerky set is like watching Jarvis Cocker fronting LCD
  Soundsystem. Kids waiting for rap at the main stage look bewildered by Amy
  Taylor’s raucous, shouty Aussie punks Amyl and the Sniffers. Trippie Redd’s
  affecting blend of the plaintive and unsettling is beautifully illustrated
  when a father plays football with his toddlers as the American raps about
  putting someone in their casket. Otherwise, with fewer stages and big names
  than previous years, the first day feels somewhat undersold and underpowered.
  US rap superstar Travis Scott’s headlining set builds in intensity as pyro and
  fireworks erupt around him, but ends abruptly 35 minutes early, without
  explanation, to a smattering of boos. Saturday is visibly busier and while
  co-headliner Chappell Roan is second on the bill here (she topped it in
  Reading on Sunday, alternating with Hozier) she pulls by far the biggest crowd
  all weekend, a sea of pink cowboy hats. Continuing her rapid ascent since
  2023’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, the American singer-songwriter
  is sensational. With a fantasy castle stage set, outfit like an Andy Warhol
  take on Elizabethan England and female musicians reminiscent of Prince’s band,
  subjects from LGBTQ+ issues to feminism to meltdowns are channelled into
  joyous, stylish, era-defining anthems. Few artists have owned the field so
  effectively in years. Irish singer-songwriter Hozier has to follow that, but
  the crowd stay put and his cosier vibe explodes into fire when he speaks up
  for Kneecap, Palestine and equality, and closes with a blazing Take Me to
  Church. Sunday is rock day, and Sheffield pop-metal kings Bring Me the Horizon
  deliver a postmodern eye- and ear-melter of a headline set where the band are
  stars in their own gigantic video game. Singer Oli Sykes is the demonic
  commander and the arm-swaying crowd and circle pits become part of the
  spectacle. Overall, though, it bodes well to see so many triumphs from newer
  artists, particularly Wunderhorse, who have gone off like a rocket since
  playing the BBC Introducing stage here last year and pack the hi-tech, usually
  dance-focused Chevron stage. For all the obvious echoes of Nirvana and REM,
  the Cornwall-based band’s undefinable edge – not least in wiry frontman Jacob
  Slater – makes them utterly compelling, and they enrapture an audience of all
  ages.
