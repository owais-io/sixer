  Zack Polanski, the insurgent candidate for Green party leader whose
  “eco-populism” and social media savvy have upended the race, is starting to
  pull away from his more-established rivals, senior figures believe. There is a
  growing expectation that the election will be won by the 42-year-old former
  Liberal Democrat, who appears to have seized the initiative from his
  opponents. One likened it to a “hostile takeover”. The comment relates to an
  apparent influx of new left-leaning members in local areas, attracted by his
  modern communications method and more pugnacious style. It has left his
  nearest opponents, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, struggling to gain traction
  despite their head start in terms of profile within the party. Voting by
  members continues throughout August, and without any interim polling any views
  are necessarily anecdotal. But a series of Green politicians, speaking
  anonymously, say Polanski is making waves with the grassroots. Ramsay and
  Chowns are largely seen as the choice of the party establishment, including
  the former leader Caroline Lucas, but Polanksi has also picked up
  endorsements. One of his backers is Caroline Russell, the Green leader on the
  London assembly, where he also sits. Russell said in a statement that while
  she was a big admirer of the other pair, Polanksi had “shown how well he
  connects with people and with the media, gaining serious air time for the
  Greens”. “I’m off the fence,” she said. Allies of Ramsay, who is currently
  co-leader with another of the party’s MPs, Carla Denyer, say the race is much
  closer, and that many longer-standing members who are not active on social
  media could turn out to push it the other way. One thing does, however, seem
  certain. The race to lead the Greens in England and Wales has been unusually –
  if only occasionally – rancorous, particularly given it is a position with
  little power and that for complex procedural reasons the term will only last
  for a year. Allies of Ramsay and Chowns, both among the party’s record haul of
  four MPs elected last year, say the pair have faced a “concerted and sometimes
  horrible” online response from Polanski supporters, something his allies
  dispute. For Polanski’s part, he was visibly upset after Ramsay refused to say
  whether he liked his opponent during a recent joint radio interview. The
  tension is in part a factor of the higher-than-usual stakes, given the Greens’
  possibly pivotal role at the next election. But it is also a reflection of the
  very differing approaches the candidates offer. Ramsay and Chowns promise a
  continued focus on gradually winning more council and parliamentary seats,
  while Polanski says he also wants to make the Greens a mass-membership
  “eco-populism” movement that creates headlines as effectively as Nigel Farage
  and Reform. One senior party member said some opponents were upset by the way
  that Polanski, who joined the Greens only in 2017, took the party hierarchy by
  surprise in launching his leadership bid in May through a Guardian interview.
  “It feels a bit like a hostile takeover of the party,” they said. “No one knew
  he was planning this, and suddenly there are all these new members who tend to
  feel very much from the left.” This is by no means a consensus view. One Green
  councillor said they had been cheered by the seeming injection of energy and
  new activists inspired by Polanski in their local branch. “He’s clearly a
  fantastic communicator and knows how to pitch his vision,” they said. “I think
  Zack is doing really well.” Some Polanski supporters express frustration with
  what they see as the overly cautious approach of the current leadership,
  arguing that the party must seize an unprecedented opportunity in British
  politics. But Ramsay and Chowns have openly expressed scepticism at what they
  see as Polanski’s polarising and simplistic approach, arguing that his more
  overtly left-leaning stance – he has said he could be open to working with the
  new party co-led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana – are likely to put off
  more moderate voters. Polanski lives in north-east London and is expected to
  try to stand for a seat there, while Ramsay and Chowns won largely rural,
  Conservative-facing seats last July, in East Anglia and Herefordshire
  respectively. They say Polanski would be unlikely to appeal in such areas.
  Ramsay, who was first elected as a Green councillor 22 years ago at the age of
  21, said he and Chowns were “really excited by the conversations we’re having
  with party members around the country”, and that a lot of them had expressed
  pride at what had been achieved in building up the number of councillors and
  MPs. “Particularly, I think, people can see that the broad appeal we have
  developed in recent years. We have pulled ourselves out of the wilderness,” he
  said. “We’ve got to keep our appeal broad.” He predicted the election result
  would hinge on the turnout. “I would urge party members to vote, because the
  higher the turnout, the more we can be confident the result reflects what
  party members want,” he said. “And that’s what matters in an election.”
  Polanski said he was “confident but not complacent” about the contest so far.
  “I’ve been overwhelmed by the positive response my campaign has been getting
  from the public online, along with countless longstanding members at hustings
  and regional visits up and down the country,” he said. “But none of this
  enthusiasm and support counts for anything if people don’t turn out to vote.”
