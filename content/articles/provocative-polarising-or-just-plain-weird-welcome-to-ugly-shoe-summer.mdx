  When it comes to summer style muses, Jane Birkin in a pair of woven sandals or
  plimsoll sneakers strolling around Provence was once the perennial reference.
  But change is afoot. This summer’s biggest footwear muses include kayakers and
  barefoot running enthusiasts. The most surprising yet desired shoes in fashion
  right now include rubber flip-flops, neoprene slip-on water shoes and Vibram’s
  FiveFingers, a glove-like fitness shoe that punctuates each individual toe.
  Last week, Lyst released a list of the most popular items being searched for
  and bought online in the second quarter of 2025. Six out of the 10 top items
  were shoes, including The Row’s £670 flip-flops (as worn by the Jurassic World
  actor Jonathan Bailey on the red carpet), faded suede boat shoes from Miu Miu,
  mesh-style jelly slippers and those aforementioned toe-pocketed shoes from
  Vibram, whose fans include the rapper Doechii and Blackpink’s Jennie. Welcome
  to ugly shoe summer. Dal Chodha, a lecturer at London’s Central Saint Martins
  fashion school who as a teenager wore Nike Air Rift trainers featuring a split
  toe, describes the trend as “polarising”. “There is so much numbness to how we
  consume each other’s style today,” he says. “I relish the jolt of somebody
  going ‘what’s that?’ or seeing someone balk.” Now, he favours Vivobarefoot’s
  Achilles sandals that splinter and frame the big toe from the foot’s other
  digits. “I like when a shoe makes me question if something is good or gets me
  out of my own taste bubble. Ugly shoes are provocative.” During Copenhagen
  fashion week, which wrapped up on Friday, weird shoes dominated the streets
  and catwalks. At OperaSport, models wore plastic flip-flops that had a rounded
  toe cap, the result of a new collaboration between the Brazilian brand
  Havaianas and the 3D printing company Zellerfeld. Rave Review added tufts of
  deadstock fabrics and ribbons to pairs of track-and-field running trainers
  from Puma, while Nicklas Skovgaard styled bouncy tulle dresses with black
  patent heeled clogs from the orthopaedic footwear brand Scholl. Outside the
  shows, there was everything from battered and buckled knee-high biker boots to
  trekking trainers from Merrell and Keen Uneeks – a fusion of a braided sandal
  and canvas trainer topped with a bungee cord toggle. Rubber wellingtons from
  Chanel, kitten heels with visible spongy insoles, embellished Crocs,
  ghillies-style dancing shoes and various cross-pollinated ballet flats
  including “sneakerinas” and “jellyrinas” were also in abundance. But it was
  the toe-spreading styles from Vibram, which start from £105, that were most
  favoured. Fia Hamelijnck, a Dutch-based creative director, originally bought
  hers for a hiking holiday. Now she wears them to the supermarket, gym and
  fashion shows. “I can see people’s eyes widening as they spot them,” she says.
  “They are ugly. But I like that. It is unexpected.” The catalyst of the
  divisive trend can be traced back to Maison Margiela’s split-toe tabi shoes,
  inspired by 15th-century Japanese thong footwear and first launched in 1988.
  After a viral TikTok in 2023 about a woman’s Tinder date stealing hers, the
  style entered mainstream conversation. Now it is as ubiquitous as a pair of
  Converse trainers. “Part of the original charm of a tabi-style shoe was to
  freak people out,” Chodha says. “Today they don’t really repulse any more. So
  people are looking to push that needle even further.” Twenty years after the
  Italian company Vibram first launched its barefoot styles, searches for
  secondhand pairs on Depop are up 296% since April. Balenciaga’s Zero shoe
  consists of a 3D-moulded sole with a logoed big toe enclosure. Khaite’s
  backless mules include a peep hole that exposes the wearer’s big toe, while
  Tory Burch sells sliders with an inbuilt metal big toe ring. On Thursday, the
  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami launched a range of colourful cutout sliders
  bearing his signature grinning flower motif at Selfridges. Ruby Redstone, a
  fashion historian and owner of the fashion store Mess in New York City, says
  “weird” shoes have always been in fashion, pointing to medieval flats with
  exaggerated pointed toes and elaborate French Rococo-style embellished heels
  as examples. Of course, like beauty, ugliness is subjective but Redstone says
  there has been a noticeable change in how people classify “what a flattering
  or functional shoe is” with “a craving for something even weirder and in the
  know”. “Ugly is such a contentious word,” adds Chodha. “These type of shoes
  are usually used by those who don’t want to conform to trends or even gender
  norms. The irony is, they have now become a trend in themselves.”
