  Every country town has its explosive Facebook page, and Castlemaine – 90
  minutes north-west of Melbourne – is no exception. “Castlemania” regularly
  flares up with heated debates: about supermarket monopolies, speed limits and
  whether or not people should have bought a house near a gun range if they’re
  not keen on loud bangs. On Saturday night at the annual costumed dance battle
  Hot Moves No Pressure, the arguments take human form. Inspired by the Facebook
  keyboard warriors, members of the Castlemaniacs dance troupe whip open their
  suit jackets to reveal the logos of the warring local supermarkets. At the end
  of their routine, they reveal “CARSTLEMAINE” spelled across their backs: a nod
  to the popular local rebuke that “There’s no ‘R’ in Castlemaine.” (Real locals
  pronounce it “Cassle”.) This is the fourth iteration of Hot Moves No Pressure,
  and its host venue, Boomtown Winery, is heaving. Yet there are no tickets for
  the public. This year there are 150 dancers across 18 groups – so after each
  performer gets their plus one, the venue is at capacity. Sign up for the fun
  stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend,
  every Saturday morning Some dancers formed groups specifically so they could
  get a ticket. “In 2023 I waited in line for two hours to get into this
  absolute candy land,” says Amy Carmichael of All Fours, a group named after
  Miranda July’s ode to perimenopausal lust, who hump out their womanly
  frustrations while wearing bankers shirts over nude shapewear. “There was a
  big crowd left outside, watching through the window.” After the date is
  announced, dancers have 12 weeks to sort a backing track, costumes and
  choreography, with the knowledge that anything half-arsed will not be
  tolerated. Groups go head-to-head in battle rounds, with the audience deciding
  the winners in a cheer-off. There’s no ultimate finale – by the time
  proceedings are three hours deep, delirium overpowers decision-making.
  Personal highlights include The Mainesplainers, who are zipped in blue flight
  jumpsuits to throw shapes to Charlie xcx’s I Love It, then assembling into a
  human rocket to take off to Enya’s Sail Away; the Fisters, who are dressed up
  demurely for a Regency-era ball, but wind up going gangsta to Doja Cat’s Boss
  Bitch; Super Duper Troupers – a cute-as-hell marching band drilling new life
  into the Proclaimers’ I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles); the Menowhores, who channel
  Stevie Nicks’ white winged doves through their creepy feathery fingers; and
  crowd favourites Fab Five, who skittle onstage as spooked-looking medical
  subjects, freshly escaped from a lab. Each troupe is wholly original, but
  there are some common features: intense facial expressions, lascivious
  thrusting and multiple costume reveals. That it’s hosted each year in such a
  small town is precisely what makes it special. “What I love about Hot Moves is
  you think, ‘Oh my god, that’s my doctor getting sexy to Prince.’ You get to
  see a totally different side to people,” says Shera Blaise, one of the
  organisers of the event, wearing a “DANCE MOM” sash. Blaise was originally a
  member of Lady Fun Times, a performance collective founded in 2016 by Rosie
  Annear (now the town’s mayor) that swelled to 25 members. When the interest
  overwhelmed them, it was decided a local event would be more practical. Hot
  Moves No Pressure is also a close cousin of Castlemaine Idyll, an annual
  Voice-style sing-off held at arts precinct Lot 19 that attracts big numbers
  and bigger costumes. Both are reflective of the town’s tendency to go above
  and beyond in the name of art: like that time 100 locals spent three years
  making a frame-for-frame recreation of Jurassic Park. Castlemaine’s community
  centre often gets involved. This year, Community House connected “orphans” new
  to town so they could form a troupe together. That group became the
  Castlemaniacs. “One of the key reasons I moved from Melbourne was to feel more
  connected to a community,” says team member Sarah Sorsby. “Being an introvert,
  I was readying myself to say ‘yes’ to things I ordinarily wouldn’t. It’s
  difficult to articulate just how important this experience has been. The world
  can feel very heavy at times and we all need more silliness and kindness in
  our lives.” Tim Watson, of Panic Attack at the Disco, has taken part every
  year. “I still remember the feeling that first year,” he says. “I was on a
  natural high for the next week. It was like a primary school fantasy come
  true. Your town and friends are there cheering you on like crazy, making you
  feel like that kid in you is the biggest glam rock star in the world.”
  Sometimes, people get carried away: last year someone opened a vat of wine at
  the rear of the stage and sprayed the audience with it. Tonight, during a
  performance from the Nudibranch Crew, the power is fritzed; maybe from one
  sequin too many being adhered by the hot glue gun backstage. In the dark, the
  crowd turns the song that was cut short – Nelly’s Hot in Herre – into a
  frenzied a capella, and by the light of someone’s phone, the Rural Hot
  Bitches, dressed in cowhide, lead a hoedown to Dolly Parton’s 9-5. It’s a
  testament to the goodwill of everyone involved that by the time power is
  restored, not one iota of enthusiasm has been lost. “It’s the most fun you can
  have while wearing pants,” as Emma Shannon of the Crotch Capacitators puts it.
  “But pants are optional.”
