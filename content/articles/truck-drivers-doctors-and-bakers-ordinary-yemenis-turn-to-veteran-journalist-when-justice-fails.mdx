  When dozens of gas tankers near Yemen’s southern city of Aden were held up at
  a checkpoint by soldiers demanding heavy bribes, the frustrated drivers and
  traders turned to a man they trusted: Fatehi Bin Lazreq, a prominent Yemeni
  journalist. Known for using his media outlets and social media platforms to
  demand accountability, Bin Lazreq posted about the drivers’ ordeal on
  Facebook. It quickly went viral, generating thousands of likes and comments.
  Within hours, the post prompted a phone call from the prime minister and
  another senior official, both pledging to resolve the issue. Soon, the tankers
  were able to move on. A few days later, a doctor in Aden contacted Bin Lazreq
  after her clinic was shut down by a health official, allegedly in retaliation
  for organising a medical conference without his involvement, despite prior
  approval from the health ministry. Bin Lazreq posted a video of the doctor’s
  account of what happened, which triggered a wave of public support. The clinic
  was reopened. “One of the most visible outcomes of the war [in Yemen] is the
  fragmentation of the country into small enclaves, each controlling a section
  of the road,” Bin Lazreq tells the Guardian from his home in Aden. “To
  survive, these groups impose levies on passing vehicles and people – fees that
  have crushed traders,” he says, referring to the tankers being held up. The
  journalist knew that privately contacting key figures in the military and
  security services, a method he typically uses before going public, would not
  work in this case. The officials and other armed groups denied any connection
  to the soldiers blocking the tankers. “We had to expose those soldiers through
  the media because we knew they wouldn’t relinquish the 30m Yemeni rials [about
  $19,000] they were demanding from the 50 tankers.” Bin Lazreq has been on the
  frontlines of reporting since the war began more than a decade ago. Based in
  Aden, he covered the Iran-backed Houthis’ brief occupation of the city in
  early 2015 and their eventual defeat by Saudi-led Yemeni forces. When
  anti-Houthi factions later turned their weapons on each other, Bin Lazreq
  stayed behind, continuing to report on the fighting and document human rights
  abuses through his Aden Al-Ghad Media Foundation, which includes a news
  website, a radio, a print newspaper, and a human rights foundation. Using his
  media outlet and a Facebook page with 600,000 followers, the Yemeni journalist
  has spent nearly a decade exposing corruption, reporting on human rights
  abuses in Aden and other cities, helping to secure the release of prisoners,
  and raising funds for impoverished individuals and struggling institutions. He
  says he realised the power of his reporting in the aftermath of Aden’s
  “liberation” in 2015, when he began shedding light on the injustices occurring
  in the city. “When I first began reporting on the situation, my voice was
  quiet and drew little attention,” he says. “I soon realised that people tend
  to rally behind louder, more assertive voices.” The main reason people turn to
  him is the collapse of state institutions during the war, a breakdown that
  persists as the conflict drags on. “The weakness of state institutions has
  pushed people to seek out journalists – those who can speak up, draw
  attention, and help bring action or solutions to their problems,” he says. He
  urges the world not to let Yemen’s decade-long war be overshadowed by the
  coverage of Gaza, Syria and Ukraine. “Thirty to 40 million Yemenis are
  suffering in the absence of a functioning state and its institutions. The
  international community must push for and support efforts to end the war,” he
  says. While acknowledging the power of social media as a tool for
  accountability, Bin Lazreq also emphasises the important role of traditional
  media. “Social media is powerful, but traditional media remains strong as
  well,” he says. “Radio, newspapers and online news platforms have all played a
  vital role in exposing injustices and defending victims across Yemen.” His
  work has not been without repercussions. He was arrested in 2017 after
  reporting on levels of corruption and claims he was tortured. His office was
  also attacked by unknown individuals. Even so, and despite the fighting, he
  refuses to take extra security precautions in Aden: “I drive a regular car and
  am not accompanied by bodyguards. “I’m convinced that if someone decides to
  eliminate you, they will – regardless of how well-protected you are. In fact,
  excessive security can sometimes attract the very danger it’s meant to
  prevent.” To ensure the authenticity of the complaints he addresses, Bin
  Lazreq has a strict policy of not investigating anonymous cases. “I don’t
  accept any complaint unless the person submits it in person and provides all
  necessary evidence, documentation and witnesses to support their case,” he
  says. “I do my best to appear unaffiliated with any political party. I believe
  that all parties have had both setbacks and successes, and that they were all
  born out of the war – and will probably fade when the war ends.” He says he
  receives a phone call every five minutes – some from people seeking justice,
  others from hungry families asking for financial help to feed their children,
  and still others from parties wanting to respond to accusations made in his
  posts. The constant stream of calls and complaints creates an overwhelming
  emotional burden – one he tries to ease through daily exercise and brief trips
  to Egypt, he says. “I work in Aden for no more than four months, then book a
  flight to Egypt, where I spend 10 days doing almost nothing but sleeping. I
  only wake up to shower, eat, reply to a few messages, and then go back to
  sleep. “That’s my routine for those 10 days – my way of recovering. When
  travel isn’t possible, I switch off my phone and retreat to my house in
  Abyan,” he says, referring to his home province. As for the future, Bin Lazreq
  has no plans to stop. “Freeing prisoners, stopping violations and restoring
  rights are what motivate any journalist to keep going,” he says. “The moment a
  journalist feels their voice no longer makes a difference, they begin to lose
  momentum. I haven’t stopped, because my presence is strong and my impact on
  society is clear.”
