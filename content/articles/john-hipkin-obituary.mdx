  My father, John Hipkin, who has died aged 90, was a teacher, councillor and
  former mayor of Cambridge. He brought intelligence, compassion and moral
  clarity to his four decades serving in local government, first as a Labour
  county councillor for Romsey ward in 1977; later, as a founding member of the
  SDP, he became a Lib Dem city councillor for Castle ward in 1992. He then
  served as an independent until his retirement from local politics in 2021. He
  was chair of the planning committee for a period and was mayor in 2005-06.
  Choosing “peace” as the focus of his year, he was touched to be invited to the
  cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan to mark the 60th anniversary of the
  atomic bombings of those cities. John was also a co-founder of the Western
  Buddhist Order in 1967, and a founder, in 1960, and director for the Advisory
  Centre for Education, a service that gives advice to parents, carers,
  governors, local authorities and others on education law. He also did research
  at King’s College Cambridge for the Public Schools Commission (1965-68),
  looking at the possibilities of integrating public schools into the maintained
  system of education. Born in Derby, John experienced adversity in his early
  life. His mother, Bunty (Elsie) Holloway, was forced to place John into the
  care of Dr Barnardo’s when he was five; his two younger siblings, Anthony and
  Naomi, were adopted separately. His father, Jack Hipkin, a mounted police
  officer, was married, and during the second world war the relationship ended.
  After being placed with foster carers, education offered John a way forward.
  He passed the 11-plus, attended two grammar schools, first in Diss, Norfolk,
  and then in Surbiton, near Kingston upon Thames. He went to the London School
  of Economics, graduating with a first-class degree in history and economics.
  John became an English teacher and was determined to give back to the system
  that changed the direction of his life. In his first post at Senacre school in
  Maidstone, Kent, he developed his own English curriculum and wrote and
  produced a play, The Massacre of Peterloo (1968), which enlisted everyone in a
  collaborative production, with each student committed to a role. He later
  became head of English at Meridian school in Royston, Hertfordshire, and
  retired in 1995. He was reunited with his mother and his sister, who had
  changed her name from Naomi to Margaret, and his brother, Anthony, who died in
  2014. Bunty had three other children, Hugh, David and Pamela. Rediscovering
  his siblings and their families was a healing experience. He is survived by
  his second wife, Marie-Louise (nee Holland), whom he married in 2004, and by
  his children Charlotte, Thomas, Joseph, Daniel and David, from his first
  marriage, to Bronwyn Dewey, which ended in divorce; me, from his relationship
  with Sylvie Chastagnol; and Imogen, from his marriage to Marie-Louise.
