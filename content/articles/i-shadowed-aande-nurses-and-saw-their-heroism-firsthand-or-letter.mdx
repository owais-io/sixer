  Re your article about Late Shift, the healthcare “disaster movie” about an
  overworked nurse pushed to her limits (The shocking hit film about overworked
  nurses that’s causing alarm across Europe, 29 July), many years ago, I was
  researching for my role as a nurse in the BBC series Casualty and was given
  the opportunity to shadow two shifts at Bristol Royal Infirmary A&amp;E
  department in order to watch the nurses at work. In every single case I
  witnessed, the patient was assessed and diagnosed, and the correct treatment
  decided upon by the nurses, who then had to wait for a doctor to agree their
  findings before any treatment could be given. I watched young doctors straight
  out of university being steered away from wrong decisions and pointed in the
  right direction by these nurses again and again. It is appalling that these
  frontline workers, who bear the brunt of so much of the trauma, both physical
  and mental, that the NHS deals with 24/7, should be paid such a pittance and
  be shown so little respect by the system they serve. Maureen Beattie London •
