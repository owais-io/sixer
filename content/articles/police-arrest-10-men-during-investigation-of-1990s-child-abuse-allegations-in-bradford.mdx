  Ten men have been arrested by police investigating allegations of child sexual
  abuse in Bradford in the 1990s. West Yorkshire police said the men were aged
  between 49 and 71, and had been arrested from addresses in the city. The
  allegations involve offences that are reported to have happened between 1994
  and 1997 and relate to six victims who were aged 13 to 15 at the time. All of
  the men had been interviewed and bailed pending further inquiries, a police
  spokesperson said. DI Vicky Greenbank of West Yorkshire police said:
  “Safeguarding and protecting children remains the top priority for West
  Yorkshire police. This investigation demonstrates the force’s ongoing
  commitment to the investigation of both current and non-recent sexual offences
  against children. “Child sexual abuse and exploitation is an abhorrent and
  heinous crime and one which affects some of the most vulnerable people in our
  society. “Tackling child abuse is not something that any one agency can do in
  isolation. We work closely with our partners and charities to support victims,
  bring perpetrators to justice and to make our communities safer. “I would urge
  anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse, whether recent or non-recent, to
  report it to the police. Please be assured that you will be listened to, taken
  seriously and supported by professionals with experience of dealing with these
  kinds of offences.” The force said anyone concerned about child exploitation
  could learn more and report to police directly on its website. For those
  affected who have not yet made a report, police said they can find out more
  about support at whenyouareready.co.uk. In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to
  children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.
  The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support
  for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331. In the US, call or text the Childhelp
  abuse hotline on 800-422-4453. In Australia, children, young adults, parents
  and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on
  1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657
