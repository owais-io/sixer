  Boavista fans would have thought things could not possibly get worse. In early
  July, a month away from celebrating their 123rd anniversary, the former
  champions of Portugal, faced with liquidation, announced that the “special
  revitalisation plan” they had put together last November had been rejected by
  the Portuguese football federation: they had failed to provide the necessary
  tax and social security certificates and guarantees in time. Riddled with debt
  (they owed €7m (£6.1m) to the construction company entrusted with the
  development of their stadium), they were so short of money that electricity
  had been cut off at their Estádio de Bessa in April after they failed to pay
  their bill. Players waited months to receive their salary. One of them, the US
  defender Reggie Cannon, whose pay was late in 28 of the 29 months he spent at
  Boavista, terminated his contract in the summer of 2023 and joined Queens Park
  Rangers. After an appeal at the court of arbitration for sport, it was
  announced last month that Boavista will have to compensate him to the tune of
  €400,000. Even when Porto’s second club finished bottom of the Primeira Liga
  last season, supporters clung to the hope that the club would be allowed to
  regroup in the second division, but Boavista did not even try to appeal
  against the federation’s decision. They knew their race was run. They lost
  their professional status, were demoted to the fifth tier and are due to play
  in the regional Porto football association’s first division next season. But
  Boavista hadn’t quite reached the bottom yet. Five days later, on 15 July,
  police officers used a battering ram to break into the club’s headquarters to
  seize documents, hard drives and computers. The suspicion was that at least
  six of the club’s executives, none of whom has been named, had engaged in tax
  fraud, credit fraud and money laundering. Boavista’s majority owner, the
  Spanish-Luxembourgian businessman Gérard López, is not one of the six
  defendants singled out by Portuguese police and no criminal charges have been
  pressed against him. Lawyers for López said he and the other current board
  members were the “alleged injured party”. The executives singled out by police
  were thought to have embezzled an estimated €10m with the complicity of
  accountants, lawyers and auditors. The former club of Nuno Gomes, Jimmy Floyd
  Hasselbaink and Raúl Meireles may not only face relegation and bankruptcy but
  extinction. There is a sense of deja vu about the catastrophe. It is not the
  first time that López, an early investor in Skype and the former owner of the
  Formula One team Lotus (whom he sold for a symbolic euro to Renault in 2015
  after they faced bankruptcy), finds his name associated with a club’s demise,
  but the third. His first foray into football ownership, in 2017, was with
  Lille, who finished second and fourth in Ligue 1 before ownership was
  transferred to the investment fund Elliott in the autumn of 2020. López had
  borrowed €225m from Elliott through a company based in the British Virgin
  Islands. Elliott, a US company, basically took control of Lille when López
  found himself incapable of repaying the loan. This did not put an end to
  López’s ambitions in football. He set out to build his own multi-club football
  empire, targeting clubs who had fallen on very hard times. Lille’s partner
  club Royal Exclesior Mouscron were in Belgium’s top tier when López bought
  them in the summer of 2020, when it was known that his time at LOSC was coming
  to an end. It was a new beginning for Les Hurlus: in this case, the beginning
  of an end which came very quickly. Mouscron were relegated in López’s first
  season. By December 2021, the club’s situation had become so dire that the
  players – who had not received their salaries on time – went on strike. By
  March 2022, Mouscron had been declared bankrupt by their own board. By the
  start of the 2022-23 season, Mouscron were no more. There is no representative
  club left in the Walloon town where the Moody Blues wrote Nights in White
  Satin and whose local football scene is mentioned in a later song, Top Rank
  Suite. The next addition to López’s portfolio, in October 2020, were Boavista,
  who had been hit by a transfer ban because of their financial difficulties.
  More bans followed under the new ownership. Eight months later, it was
  Girondins de Bordeaux, one of France’s historically most successful clubs,
  where Zinédine Zidane made his name in the early 1990s, whom López acquired
  from the investment management firm King Street Capital for an undisclosed sum
  in July 2021. The Girondins were relegated to Ligue 2 the following season. By
  2024 Bordeaux, despite the sale of key players and of their women’s team,
  faced legal action from 400 unpaid creditors and were looking at their
  demotion to the third tier by the French football regulator, the DNCG. It
  turned out to be worse than that. López unsuccessfully tried to bring in new
  investors, including Liverpool’s majority owner, Fenway Sports Group. The club
  were put on sale, but no buyer declared any interest. At is stands, López
  remains the owner of Girondins, who will play in National 2, France’s amateur
  fourth tier, in the 2025-26 season. Talking to L’Équipe, the DNCG president,
  Jean-Marc Mickeler, was scathing in his appraisal of what had happened in
  Bordeaux. He said the problems could have been avoided if the club had not had
  “too much debt, not enough equity, [and] over-optimistic projections based on
  qualification for the Champions League and regular player sales. We had warned
  about this from the beginning.” Every time, be it in Belgium, Portugal or
  France, López had presented himself as the saviour who would turn round the
  fortunes of the clubs he acquired; every time, he failed and now he finds
  himself the ruler of an empire of dust.
