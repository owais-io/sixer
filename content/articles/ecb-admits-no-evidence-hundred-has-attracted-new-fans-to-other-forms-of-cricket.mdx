  ECB admits no evidence Hundred has attracted new fans to other forms of
  cricket

  Richard Gould, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s chief executive, has
  admitted his organisation has no evidence that new fans attracted by the
  Hundred have gone on to attend other forms of the game. The ECB has long
  boasted that the tournament has attracted a different audience to existing
  formats. “The Hundred is all about throwing cricket’s doors open – and it’s
  already delivering,” the ECB’s then chief executive, Tom Harrison, said after
  the first tournament in 2021. “We need to grow cricket, reach more people, and
  that’s exactly what the Hundred does.” A report published last October found
  that 31% of tickets for the Hundred have been bought by women, 23% were bought
  for juniors and 41% of buyers attended in family groups. But on the day
  counties received their first down payment on the windfall generated by
  external investment into the eight Hundred franchises Gould said no work had
  been done into finding out if any of those new fans remain involved in the
  sport when the tournament is out of action. “That’s probably a bit of work we
  need to do,” he said. “Just to check that when people do come in, where do
  they go? Because you might get some coming in to Test cricket [who] then go to
  the Hundred and Hundred into Test cricket. We haven’t done that work in any
  great detail.” That lack of work is surprising given cross-pollination between
  formats is one of the ECB’s primary goals. “Fandom is really important for us,
  whether it’s England, Leicestershire or London Spirit,” Gould said. “That’s
  the key. We’ve got a really dedicated core audience, which is relatively small
  compared to other sports. Then we’ve got lots of people that are very
  interested in cricket, but perhaps don’t come to it as often as we want. “We
  know the interest is there, we just need to get people to come more often for
  all formats, rather than just that ‘I’ve been to the Test once a year’ type of
  thing.” This year’s Hundred, which starts at Lord’s on Tuesday, is likely to
  be the last before new owners start to push through significant changes, from
  team names and kits to the length of the format itself. “That’s the kind of
  conversation we’re starting to get into now,” said Vikram Banerjee, the
  tournament’s managing director. “It would be slightly odd to bring all these
  great people in and then just leave it as it is.” Deals for the sale of part
  or full stakes in six of the eight Hundred franchises were finalised this
  week, with the final two expected imminently. The total investment has been
  put at £520m, of which an initial sum of “just north of £400,000” has been
  released to every county. Host counties can expect to receive a minimum of
  £18m and non-hosts around £25m. The possibility of adding a ninth team has
  already been discussed, but non-hosts have been warned against spending their
  windfalls on unnecessary stadium upgrades. “When giving guidance as to what a
  future expansion team needs to look like in terms of facilities, we’re not
  going to be setting huge capacities,” Gould said. “What we don’t want is a
  load of empty plastic seats around the place. We’re not looking to see
  investment going into creating white elephants.”
