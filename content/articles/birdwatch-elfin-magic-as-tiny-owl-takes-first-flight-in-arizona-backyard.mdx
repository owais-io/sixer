  Elf owl (Micrathene whitneyi) For back yard birding at its best, it’s hard to
  beat Arizona’s Sierra Vista, home to the Southwest Wings Birding and Nature
  festival. As many as a dozen different kinds of hummingbird spar like wartime
  flying aces around the feeders, while Mexican jays utter shrill warning calls
  at a diamondback rattlesnake lurking below. But for a really special back yard
  bird, I must wait until dusk. Local birder Tony welcomes me and my old friend
  Chris, and as darkness falls we sit and wait, hoping it will make an
  appearance. Our eyes are fixed on a nest-hole a few metres above our heads,
  home to the world’s smallest raptor: the aptly named elf owl. Barely the size
  of a sparrow, this bird is just 13-14cm long, and weighs a mere 40g. Moments
  later, right on cue, a quizzical face appears at the entrance. This is the
  single survivor of two chicks, waiting impatiently for its parent to bring
  back food. But the adult has a very different agenda: it knows the youngster
  is now ready to leave the nest. So it calls loudly from a distance, trying to
  tempt its recalcitrant offspring to take the plunge. That night the young owl
  stayed put, but the following evening Tony saw it fly for the very first time.
  Tiny it may be, but this pint-sized predator is now busily wreaking terror on
  even smaller creatures of the night.
