  Liverpool’s financial position has been strengthened before a potential bid
  for Alexander Isak after Luis Díaz completed his €75m (£65.5m) move to Bayern
  Munich. Díaz has signed a four-year contract with the option of an extra year
  with the Bundesliga champions after Liverpool received an improved offer they
  felt represented fair market value for the 28-year-old Colombia international
  on Sunday. Díaz, who left Liverpool’s pre-season training camp in Tokyo on
  Monday to seal the transfer, turns 29 in January and had made it clear he
  wished to leave the Premier League champions. The winger had wanted to leave
  last summer but Liverpool stood firm before Arne Slot’s debut season as head
  coach. The club subsequently attempted to renew his contract, which was due to
  expire in 2027, but with no prospect of an agreement and Bayern improving
  their bid with achievable add-ons, Liverpool reluctantly agreed to his sale.
  Díaz played a key role in the club’s 20th league title triumph last season and
  scored 17 goals in all competitions. Díaz is the third most expensive transfer
  in Bayern’s history, behind Harry Kane and Lucas Hernández. He is also the
  third biggest sale in Liverpool’s history behind Philippe Coutinho and Luis
  Suárez, both of whom joined Barcelona. “Three years and a half that I’ll
  treasure forever. I arrived with all the dreams in the world, and I am leaving
  proud of everything we achieved together,” Díaz posted on Instagram. “I have
  met incredible people, fabulous colleagues, coaches who helped me a lot, and
  extraordinary fans. Liverpool is, indeed, a special team, and I will keep
  everyone in my heart … “It would have been the perfect goodbye if we hadn’t
  lost one of ours in such a tragic way,” Díaz added, referring to former
  teammate Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car accident earlier this month. “As
  I said, and I repeat, I carry everyone with me in my heart, but one of them in
  particular: Diogo. I will never forget him. We will never forget him. Thank
  you for everything. YNWA.” Liverpool paid an initial €45m to sign Díaz from
  Porto in January 2022 with €15m payable in potential add-ons. Only €4m of
  those add-ons have been triggered and, with Porto holding no sell-on clause,
  Liverpool will make a profit of €26m on the deal. The completion of Díaz’s
  move to Germany means Liverpool have raised more than £190m in player sales
  since Richard Hughes became sporting director in June 2024. The champions have
  spent almost £300m this summer, including add-ons, but remain interested in
  signing Isak should Newcastle show an inclination to sell their prized asset.
  Liverpool accept it would take a British record transfer fee to bring the
  Sweden international to Anfield, a move the striker is understood to want, and
  are likely to have the finances to make it happen with Darwin Núñez, Harvey
  Elliott, Tyler Morton and Ben Doak all potentially leaving this summer.
