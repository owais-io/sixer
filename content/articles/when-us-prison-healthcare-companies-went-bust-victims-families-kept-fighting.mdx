  When Jennifer Casey Norred attempted suicide at Leon county jail in
  Tallahassee, Florida, medical staff didn’t take her to the emergency room or
  provide mental health support. Instead, they strapped her to a chair for 24
  hours, according to jail records. The jail’s own policy requires that
  restraint chairs only be used as a last resort, and not for more than two
  hours. It was the kind of policy violation that has become more common
  nationwide since two private equity-backed prison health companies, Corizon
  and Wellpath, have come to dominate the industry, experts say. Within three
  days, Norred – who went by Casey to her friends and family – would attempt
  suicide again, and succeed. An investigation by the Guardian published on
  Monday revealed how Wellpath and Corizon (now renamed YesCare) have remained
  leaders in the business of providing healthcare to incarcerated people even
  though multiple government bodies, including the Department of Justice, have
  documented cases where these companies’ failure to provide adequate care
  violated prisoners’ constitutional rights and in some cases was even linked to
  preventable deaths. A wrongful death complaint filed on Norred’s behalf
  alleged that to save money Corizon refused to provide “actual mental health
  treatment and therapy”. Corizon denied these allegations in a legal filing.
  But laws that restrict prisoners’ ability to sue and that protect the private
  equity firms who own the healthcare companies facing lawsuits make it
  difficult to seek justice. And when the healthcare companies file for
  bankruptcy, the situation gets even more complicated. “Healthcare in
  correctional facilities is often a black box,” said Dan Mistak, acting
  president of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, a non-profit
  that aims to improve healthcare quality for incarcerated people. “With almost
  no transparency, and the ability to dodge accountability through bankruptcy
  and corporate restructuring, these companies can deliver substandard or even
  deadly care and still turn a profit,” Mistak explained. Neither Wellpath nor
  Corizon (YesCare) responded to requests for comment. The Guardian has examined
  how several cases like Norred’s have played out in the bankruptcy court,
  rather than the traditional civil justice system. When a company files for
  bankruptcy, all legal claims against it are automatically paused, adding an
  extra layer of difficulty for plaintiffs. Wellpath and Corizon both filed for
  bankruptcy in part because of mounting lawsuits alleging negligent care. One
  of these was a wrongful death claim filed by Beth Frederick, Norred’s mother,
  in 2019. The bankruptcy courts ultimately became the unlikely venue that
  allowed victims to have their voices amplified – and possibly change the way
  these companies will operate in the future. On 24 July 2017, three days after
  Norred’s first suicide attempt, plainclothes officers appeared at her parents’
  door and informed her mother that Norred had been found dead in her cell. It
  would be months before she learned the full, gruesome circumstances that led
  to their daughter’s death. Corizon was contracted to provide medical care at
  Leon county jail, and Corizon staff’s jail logs show that while Norred was
  strapped down, she was “crying head hanging down” in multiple entries; then
  “screaming and yelling blowing off some steam”; then “quiet now probably tired
  from all that screaming”. For part of that time, she was sitting in her own
  urine. “It was the exact wrong response. Let’s punish you,” Norred’s mother
  said. In 2023, Scott Allen filed a lawsuit similar to Frederick’s. Allen’s
  son, Brady, 41, had died within a day of being arrested in Kennesaw, Georgia,
  on suspicion he had trespassed and gone swimming in a stranger’s outdoor pool.
  Brady was placed in a jail where Wellpath, another company backed by private
  equity, had been contracted to provide medical services. Brady suffered from
  depression and had recently survived a drug overdose. According to Cobb county
  sheriff’s office policy, given his mental state, he should have received a
  full medical evaluation upon entering the jail. Instead the Wellpath staff put
  Brady in an isolation cell. According to video footage and his father’s legal
  complaint against Wellpath, Brady spent the night pulling out most of his hair
  and pushing an emergency button over 100 times. Nobody came to Brady’s cell
  until he tried to pull the fire alarm from the wall the next morning.
  Eventually a sergeant approached the cell door and told him to turn around and
  put his hands against the wall. As Brady tried to push past the sergeant and
  escape his cell, the sergeant and three deputies attacked him with pepper ball
  guns, Tasers and blows as Brady continued to resist, according to the internal
  investigation. Finally the sergeant “felt inmate Brady Allen suddenly relax”.
  He had died. Wellpath did not respond to a request for comment. Both wrongful
  death cases seemed doomed when the companies involved – Corizon and Wellpath –
  each filed for bankruptcy. Frederick’s lawsuit on behalf of her daughter Casey
  Norred was dragging on, as the defendants requested multiple extensions and
  sought to dismiss the case. In February 2023, as Corizon faced mounting
  lawsuits, as well as Covid-related financial distress, the company attempted a
  bankruptcy maneuver known as the “Texas two-step” and split into two new
  companies, YesCare and Tehum. Corizon’s private equity owners moved all the
  company’s assets into YesCare, and all its liabilities, including lawsuits
  like Frederick’s, into Tehum. Then Tehum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, in
  effect pausing all lawsuits against it. Even in a run-of-the-mill bankruptcy
  case, all lawsuits, including wrongful death claims against the company
  filing, are automatically paused. Frederick cried when she heard her
  years-long fight was at a stalemate. “It blew me away,” Frederick said. “In
  what world are you permitted to put your assets in one pot and your
  liabilities in the other and declare bankruptcy?” The move caught the
  attention of lawmakers. Senators led by Elizabeth Warren wrote an open letter
  in 2024 to the trustee in the bankruptcy case, expressing concern that Corizon
  “knowingly has used the ‘Texas Two-Step’ maneuver to attempt to evade the
  countless wrongful death, medical malpractice, and other tort claims against
  it, principally to the detriment of incarcerated people who claimed they had
  been harmed by Corizon”. The company’s initial Chapter 11 bankruptcy proposal
  would have probably left claimants like Frederick, if they had prevailed, with
  nothing after all the legal fees and other expenses were paid, according to
  lawyers representing Frederick and other claimants. In November 2024, a year
  and a half after Corizon filed for bankruptcy, Wellpath, the market leader in
  prison healthcare also filed for bankruptcy. Their proposed Chapter 11 plan
  would similarly have left those claimants – like Brady Allen’s family – who
  had suffered under the company’s allegedly negligent care in effect with
  nothing if they had prevailed, according to creditors’ lawyers. Brendan
  Ballou, a former federal prosecutor and author of Plunder on private equity,
  said the families faced an especially steep uphill battle. “The legal system
  in general is awfully complicated, but bankruptcy might be the most
  complicated,” Ballou explained – especially for people who are incarcerated,
  and especially for people seeking justice from private equity-backed
  companies. “The chances are good that the private equity owners are going to
  be able to essentially walk into the sunset without consequence,” Ballou said.
  But a series of unlikely events meant that stories like Norred’s and Allen’s
  had an unusual amount of sway in the bankruptcy courts. *** The bankruptcy
  code was designed to help ensure that the debtor’s available assets are
  distributed as fairly as possible among creditors. But as private equity
  investors continue to drive their acquisitions into bankruptcy, they are also
  looking for ways to use the code to squirrel assets away from the people they
  have hurt, according to Ballou. In Corizon’s bankruptcy case, however,
  unexpected circumstances gave claimants like Frederick a fighting chance. A
  judge who had been acting as a mediator in the case, who had seemed to favor
  YesCare, resigned over unethical behavior, inviting scrutiny from lawmakers.
  Nine senators, led by Senator Warren, wrote an open letter accusing Corizon
  and its investors of using the bankruptcy system to get out of paying alleged
  victims. A month later, Frederick got a call. The trustee overseeing the
  bankruptcy case invited her to join the so-called tort claimants committee
  (TCC), a group of six members which would have a role in determining the final
  bankruptcy plan. All the committee members had claims against Corizon. Five
  had wrongful death claims while one, Nathan Alvarez, had served time in an
  Arizona prison that contracted with Corizon. In 2019, Alvarez fell from his
  cell bunk. His bone snapped audibly as it broke in two places. When he looked
  down, his leg was shaped like a “yield sign”, he said. Alvarez’s cellmates had
  to beat against the walls to get the guards’ attention. Alvarez assumed he was
  going to the emergency room, but prison staff told him that policy dictated he
  would need to get an X-ray first, unless there was bone visibly sticking out
  of his leg. By the time Alvarez saw a doctor, his leg was swollen and
  inoperable. Alvarez was told to return once the swelling improved, but as he
  waited out his sentence, he never received treatment. His leg eventually
  healed – with his foot pointed the wrong way. It would cost $200,000 to
  rebreak and reset Alvarez’s bones. His lawyers had nearly reached a deal with
  Corizon, when the bankruptcy put his lawsuit on hold. “After years of
  fighting, it felt like, oh, that’s it. We’re screwed,” Alvarez said. Joining
  the TCC gave him a chance to fight back. Corizon did not respond to the
  Guardian’s request for comment. Frederick didn’t expect much from the process,
  but she would get to say her piece. “I wanted to embarrass them,” she said.
  Throughout the rest of the case, the TCC would submit documents to the court
  detailing their stories and opinions on what should happen. The TCC wanted the
  bankruptcy dismissed, so that everyone with claims against Corizon, including
  those who were still incarcerated, could have their day in civil court. For
  two years, the TCC had weekly zoom meetings with their attorneys at Brown
  Rudnick. They weren’t able to get the case dismissed, but they did get renewed
  leverage in April 2024, when the new bankruptcy judge rejected YesCare’s
  proposed reorganization plan, which would have essentially forced Alvarez and
  Frederick and all the other tort claimants to take a $5,000 settlement. Eric
  Goodman, one of the attorneys representing the TCC, ultimately engaged in an
  intense back and forth with YesCare to reach a deal that would satisfy most of
  the victims as well as the debtors. In March, they agreed to a plan and the
  judge confirmed it – the first ever successful reorganization in a Texas
  two-step case. At least $25m would go to wrongful death and personal injury
  claims, manyfold higher than the initial offer. Victims with claims could
  choose to opt out and pursue a jury trial with no cap on potential
  settlements. Alvarez is happy to have had a role in some kind of victory,
  although he doubts the settlement, which will be paid in installments over 30
  months, will even cover the surgery he needs for his leg. He misses
  construction work. “I’d love to be able to dig a hole,” he said. In Wellpath’s
  case, too, the US trustee overseeing the bankruptcy case wanted to make sure
  that wrongful death claimants would have a say in the final Chapter 11
  bankruptcy plan. During a hearing last December, the trustee said it was
  important that the bankruptcy provided a fair recovery not just for Wellpath’s
  lenders, who would typically be prioritized in a bankruptcy case, but for
  personal injury and wrongful death claimants as well. According to Ballou,
  it’s not typical for claimants like Scott Allen to have much sway in the
  bankruptcy court. But that might be starting to change. “They played an
  enormous role in this case,” said Daniel Desatnik, one of the lawyers
  representing claimants including Allen in the Wellpath bankruptcy. “The story
  in this case should be that it is a model for a successful chapter 11
  reorganization, where the voices of those who alleged harm were heard and the
  judge was responsive to it.” Claimholders in Wellpath’s bankruptcy case
  objected to the initial Chapter 11 plan, arguing that the amount of money on
  offer would not even cover administrative costs of their claims. The final
  Chapter 11 plan gave them 33% of the reorganized company in addition to $25m
  in cash and secured debt. Desatnik said he could not go into detail about what
  kind of role victims of Wellpath’s wrongdoing will have in making company
  decisions, but that, “They have a say commensurate with what you would expect
  an owner of that level of equity would have.” Ensuring that the company
  behaves more ethically was a major consideration as they were negotiating the
  plan. It’s an unusual victory, giving victims equity in the company that hurt
  them. Not every victim will get a share of the bankruptcy settlements, either
  – those who filed their lawsuits too late in the bankruptcy process will not
  be able to pursue their claims. And while the prison healthcare companies
  themselves had to restructure and pay settlements, it was unclear how much
  their private equity owners lost in the bankruptcy deals. According to Ballou,
  even if on paper it looks like they lost their investment, they could have
  gotten quite a bit back in fees they leveraged from their investments, but
  most of those details remain hidden. Samir Parikh, a law professor and
  bankruptcy expert at Wake Forest University, said that bankruptcy courts were
  “not the ideal check on bad behavior, because the harm has already been
  realized”. Just a few months ago, Frederick received a paper bag from the Leon
  county jail with her daughter’s belongings. She could not bring herself to
  look inside, but she also could not throw it away. “I’m sure this is clothing
  I’ve seen her wear before, and it would make me sad,” Frederick said during a
  phone interview, adding, “Maybe I’ll look at it when we hang up.” Frederick
  plans to donate some of the settlement money to an animal rescue, which is
  what Norred would have wanted. One day in middle school, Norred came home and
  announced she was a vegetarian. Frederick thought it was a phase, but it
  stuck. When Norred was alive and mentally OK, she was known to be kind,
  vivacious and an “exquisite dancer” at the blues club where she worked, her
  mother recalled. Her funeral was so crowded it was standing room only.
