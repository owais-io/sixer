  “Alarmingly high” levels of toxic forever chemicals have been detected at
  English airports – in some cases thousands of times higher than proposed EU
  safe levels – with experts raising concerns over the potential impact on
  drinking water sources. Seventeen airports recorded elevated levels of Pfas in
  the ground and surface water sample on their sites, according to unpublished
  Environment Agency documents, obtained exclusively by the Ends Report and the
  Guardian via an environmental information request. Pfas, short for per- and
  polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a family of about 10,000 chemicals which
  persist in the environment and have been linked to a range of serious
  illnesses. They are used in many consumer products, from frying pans to
  waterproof coats, but one of their most common uses is in firefighting foams.
  The largest Pfas total recorded was at London Luton airport, with total Pfas
  in one groundwater sample, taken at a location described as “fire training
  lagoon two”, of 36,084 nanograms per litre. There is no regulatory limit for
  Pfas in ground or surface water in the UK, but in the EU a proposed threshold
  is being considered of 4.4ng/l. While Luton tested for twice the number of
  Pfas than that included in the EU threshold, the airport’s highest total Pfas
  level was 8,000 times higher than the draft limit. Among the specific Pfas
  detected at these 17 airports were PFOS and PFOA – two banned and toxic
  chemicals which, respectively, are suspected and known carcinogens. One sample
  taken from “borehole four” at London Luton contained 2,555ng/l of Pfas, with
  24ng/l of PFOS and 39ng/l of PFOA. This total Pfas level is more than 500
  times higher than the EU’s proposed threshold. A London Luton airport
  spokesperson said: “Like many airports and other industries in the UK and
  around the world, we are investing in and working closely with relevant
  agencies to assess and monitor Pfas.” They added that the data obtained by
  this investigation was from preliminary screening and should not be considered
  statistically representative, as a long-term monitoring programme was still
  under way. Of the airports sampled, Ends Report’s analysis has revealed that
  four of the 17 are located within protected drinking water safeguard zones.
  These are designated areas set up around public water supplies where
  additional pollution control measures are needed. One sample taken at
  Farnborough airport, Hampshire, located in a drinking water safeguard zone,
  contained 180ng/l of PFOS. The Drinking Water Inspectorate has set a guideline
  safe level of 100ng/l for the total levels of 48 named Pfas. If test results
  in drinking water come close to this threshold, then the inspectorate states
  that precautions should be taken. The presence of elevated Pfas in the sample
  does not necessarily mean that drinking water is being contaminated by the
  airport’s Pfas pollution. Experts say that for this to happen, pathways would
  need to exist to enable Pfas to enter drinking water sources. Dr Patrick
  Byrne, a reader in hydrology and environmental pollution at Liverpool John
  Moores University, said: “The risk, if any, to downstream receptors like
  drinking water sources and ecosystems is unclear. To understand the risk, we
  need to establish if there is a transport pathway between the source and the
  receptor. If there is no transport pathway, there is a very low risk.”
  However, for Dr Shubhi Sharma, from the charity Chem Trust, the high levels of
  Pfas detected at airports are “extremely worrying as some of these Pfas have
  been established as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization”. Dr Rob
  Collins, director of policy and science at the Rivers Trust, described the
  Pfas concentrations at UK airports as “alarmingly high”. While uncertainty
  remains over the potential risk these may pose, Pfas contamination of drinking
  water from airports has previously been confirmed close to home. In Jersey,
  residents have been recommended bloodletting to reduce high concentrations of
  Pfas in their blood after private drinking water supplies were polluted by the
  use of Pfas in firefighting foams at the island’s airport. In France, one
  region had to take whole drinking water supplies out of use due to Pfas
  contamination from an airport. A spokesperson for the trade association
  AirportsUK said: “This year UK airports are spending around £5m in
  investigating the sources and nature of Pfas issues on their sites – it is
  this industry work that this data comes from. “This work is being done with a
  view to identifying specific source locations so that appropriate actions can
  be assessed. Airports are working closely with the Environment Agency and
  local communities to ensure that they do not make their way into watercourses
  and food chains.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and
  Rural Affairs said: “We are reshaping the UK Reach [chemicals regulation] work
  programme to deliver stronger protections and are currently considering the
  best approach to chemicals regulation in the UK, including the development of
  a restriction dossier on Pfas in firefighting foams”.
