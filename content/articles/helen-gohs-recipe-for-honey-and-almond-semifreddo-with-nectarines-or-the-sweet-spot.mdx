  Softer and lighter than ice-cream, semifreddo, which is Italian for
  “half-cold” or “half-frozen”, is also easier to make because it doesn’t need
  churning. Customise this one by swapping the almonds for pistachios, and
  serving it with cherries or other seasonal fruit. Do seek out the anise seeds,
  though, because they add such a lovely pop of flavour. The praline can be made
  up to a week ahead and stored in an airtight container in the freezer, while
  the semifreddo itself will keep happily in the freezer for about a week. Honey
  and almond semifreddo with nectarines Prep 5 min Cook 1 hr 15 min Freeze
  Overnight Serves 8 For the praline 90g sugar 70g whole roasted almonds Pinch
  of sea salt For the semifreddo 5 egg yolks 20g runny honey 80g caster sugar 2
  egg whites 300ml double cream 1 tsp anise seeds, lightly toasted and crushed
  in a mortar For the nectarines 2 tsp caster sugar 2 tsp lemon juice 2 tsp
  runny honey A pinch of salt 4 ripe nectarines 1 sprig fresh basil or mint,
  leaves roughly torn Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and set aside.
  To make the praline, put the sugar and 30ml water in a small saucepan and set
  it over a low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then turn up the heat to
  medium-high and cook, without stirring but swirling the pan occasionally,
  until the mix turns a deep golden colour. Stir in the almonds, then pour on to
  the lined tray, sprinkle with sea salt and leave to cool and harden. Once
  hardened, break up the praline, then pulse in a food processor (or bash with a
  rolling pin) to break down into small, irregular pieces no larger than 1cm.
  Store in an airtight container in the freezer until needed. Line the base and
  sides of a 10cm x 20cm loaf tin with greaseproof paper, leaving a generous
  overhang to help you lift the semifreddo out later. Fill a medium saucepan a
  third of the way up with water and bring to a simmer. In a medium heatproof
  bowl, whisk the egg yolks, honey and 40g sugar, then set the bowl over the
  pan, ensuring the base isn’t touching the water. Whisk for six to eight
  minutes, until thick and pale, then take off the heat and whisk (ideally over
  a bowl of ice) until cooled. Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric
  mixer and whisk until white and foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 40g
  sugar, whisking until it dissolves and the mix comes to firm peaks. Scrape the
  meringue into the egg yolk bowl, but don’t mix it in just yet. In the same
  bowl and with the same whisk attachment (no need to wash them), whip the cream
  to soft peaks. Scrape this into the yolk bowl, too, then add the anise seeds
  and praline, and fold until just combined. Scrape the mixture into the lined
  tin, smooth the top and freeze overnight (or for up to a week). About 30
  minutes before serving, prepare the nectarines. In a medium bowl, whisk the
  sugar, lemon juice, honey and salt. Halve and stone the nectarines, then cut
  them into 1cm wedges. Toss with the syrup and herbs, then leave to macerate.
  To serve, lift the semifreddo out of its tin using the overhang, then cut into
  roughly 2½cm-thick slices. Arrange on plates, spoon the nectarines on top and
  serve at once.
