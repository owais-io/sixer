  How often do you eat rice? Even if it’s not a daily staple in your house, it’s
  safe to say most Britons cook and eat rice at least a few times a week. And
  while it may seem a simple thing to cook, it can be surprisingly difficult to
  get it right. From long-grain to quick-cook, brown basmati to jasmine,
  different rice grains have different cook times, different rates of absorption
  and varying starch levels, which can all affect the result. Instead of fluffy,
  individual grains, you may find your rice burnt, stuck to the pan or with a
  claggy, chalky or overly glutinous texture. Dinner ruined. That’s where a
  specialist rice cooker comes in. They’re a common kitchen appliance in Asia,
  and the best rice cookers guarantee perfect rice every time. Many machines
  intuitively set up the cooking time and guide you to add the correct ratio of
  rice to water depending on the variety. Many have a delay function, or can
  safely keep the rice warm for up to 24 hours – so you’ll always have dinner
  ready and waiting. Today’s technology has also seen some rice cookers become
  multifunctional, with the ability to slow cook, sear and stir, too. At the
  other end of the spectrum are basic microwave rice cookers – we tested this
  variety too. *** At a glance Best rice cooker overall: Yum Asia Bamboo rice

  £94.90 at Yum Asia *** Why you should trust me I’ve been testing kitchen
  goods, recipes, food and drink for newspapers and websites for a decade, so I
  have a good grasp of what’s really useful to have in your cupboard, and
  whether something is good value for money. I enjoy cooking but am far from an
  expert, so I approach these appliances just like any other home cook would. I
  cook for my family every night and understand how much of a tricky balance it
  can be to make tasty, nutritious food without spending hours in the kitchen.
  Ultimately, I’m looking for gadgets that are easy to use, give good results
  and can make your life easier. How I tested I tested 10 rice cookers, each of
  which was either personally recommended, well-reviewed or from a well-known
  kitchen appliance brand. Most were new to me, although a few I had tested
  years previously, and one appliance was still in play from my slow cooker
  testing. To test each machine, I cooked a cup of basmati rice, following the
  manufacturer’s instructions where provided or using the ratio suggested on the
  rice packet if not. Next, I cooked a cup of sushi rice using the same method;
  few appliances gave guidelines for cooking sushi rice, so I used the on-pack
  instructions. If the appliance performed well during both these tests, I then
  experimented with brown rice and jasmine rice. Some appliances had further
  functionality that needed testing – where there were risotto programs, for
  example, I made risotto following recipes provided by the manufacturer. In the
  interests of safety, I also used an external sensor to record the temperature
  of the appliance at the end of the rice cooking program; none of the machines
  posed a hazard and were all fairly cool to touch. Some of the rice I cooked
  wasn’t edible and had to be thrown away, but most of it was good quality – so
  I ate rice every which way over the month-long testing period. Luckily, if
  food safety guidelines are followed carefully, it’s perfectly fine to freeze
  cooked rice, so I had a useful supply of fluffy basmati, fragrant jasmine,
  sticky sushi rice and creamy risottos on hand. My family and I reached peak
  rice consumption levels, thanks to the weekly poke bowls, Indian banquets, egg
  fried rice and everything in between. The rice cookers sourced for this
  article are either being sent back to the manufacturers or donated to a
  community hub in Barnet, where they will find useful new homes or be used in a
  community kitchen. *** The best rice cookers in 2025 in the UK *** Best rice
  cooker overall: Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker £189.90 at Yum Asia £199.90 at
  Amazon The Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker uses 3D induction heating technology –
  whereby the rice is surrounded by heat to cook evenly – and its “AI Smart
  Brain” microprocessor to analyse the weight of the rice, water volume and
  other factors to cook rice using a wide range of settings. Choose from
  white/long grain, short, brown, crust, quick cook, “yumami” and gaba
  (germinated), add the specified amount of water to well-rinsed rice, and away
  you go for enough rice for up to eight people. Other settings are accessed on
  the easy-to-use LED display panel: steam, porridge, slow cook and cake, all
  cooked within the same ceramic-coated inner bowl or using the steam basket
  supplied. Why we love it Yum Asia is a master of rice cooking, with an
  unparalleled understanding of how to cook different types of rice to
  perfection. I’ve never made sushi rice as perfect as in this machine, and it
  churned out variety after variety of the same quality. One cup takes about 35
  minutes to cook, although the gaba setting – which claims to germinate brown
  rice to increase its nutritional value – takes a bit longer. I’m someone who
  has never particularly enjoyed brown rice, but I do now. The machine
  automatically keeps warm once the rice is cooked and has a delay function, as
  you’d expect. It’s large enough to be useful, but not too large for easy
  storage, and it operates with just a low whirring noise and no excessive
  steam. I also like the cool handles to lift out the pot; others should take
  heed. A standout machine. It’s a shame that … I have no criticism to make of
  the Yum Asia Bamboo: it’s perfect – if you can afford it. Claimed number of
  portions: eight Time to cook one cup of basmati rice: 35mins Dimensions: 27 x
  37 x 24cm (WDH) Capacity: 1.5l External temperature at end of cook: 21C ***
  Best budget rice cooker: Russell Hobbs large rice cooker £39.99 at Robert Dyas
  £28.99 at Amazon A large-capacity, budget-friendly, no-frills rice cooker from
  Russell Hobbs that performs better than you’d expect. The instructions are
  light on the ground, as is its functionality – there are no different programs
  or guidelines for different types of rice, nor any timer function. Why we love
  it To my surprise, the Russell Hobbs rice cooker handled every type of rice
  well. Basmati, sushi, brown and jasmine rice all cooked quickly and evenly
  without any fuss, sticking or mess. It was also the only machine that didn’t
  stipulate rice should be washed first, so I didn’t. The rice was still great
  and took between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the variety, and the machine
  switched to keep-warm mode automatically after cooking. This large-capacity
  cooker would be ideal for any family. It’s a shame that … there’s no estimated
  time for how long your rice will take to cook. You’ll learn this over time,
  but the first few times you’ll need to stand over the cooker until it’s done.
  Especially as I wouldn’t recommend leaving this one on the keep-warm mode for
  too long: the rice dries out fast. Claimed number of portions: 12 Time to cook
  one cup of basmati rice: 20mins Dimensions: 32.2 x 24.5 x 22.6cm (WDH)
  Capacity: 2.8l External temperature at end of cook: 45C *** Best multi-cooker
  rice cooker: Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker £112 at John Lewis £119.99 at
  Ninja The Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker doesn’t bill itself as a rice
  cooker, but it’s hard to define it as any one thing with this much
  functionality. I held on to this one after our test of the best slow cookers
  so that I could put it through its paces against designated rice-cooking
  appliances. Why we love it I wasn’t surprised to find it did well – Ninja
  appliances can rarely be faulted in my experience. I used the steam function
  to cook the rice, but you’ll get all the other functions too: slow cook, sear,
  braise, simmer, bake, prove and keep warm. With one of these, there’s no need
  for a separate rice cooker. Ninja suggests a recipe for risotto, which turned
  out beautifully. You’ll need to scour the internet to find guidelines for
  other types of rice, but I made a guess at a ratio and cook time (one cup of
  basmati rice to two cups of water, 10 minutes on steam function and a
  five-minute rest) and it was successful – no sticking, scorching or excess
  starch. I cooked sushi rice equally successfully using the same method, and I
  increased the water by half a cup and cooking time by five minutes when
  dealing with brown rice, which worked well. It’s a shame that … it’s very
  large. But with this many settings, it can replace so many other appliances in
  one. Claimed number of portions: eight large portions Time to cook one cup of
  basmati rice: 15mins Dimensions: 28 x 29 x 42cm (WDH) Capacity: 8l External
  temperature at end of cook: 45C *** Best microwave rice cooker: Sistema rice
  steamer £7.99 at Currys £7.99 at Amazon A microwave rice steaming bowl is
  nothing new, but it’s probably not something most of us own. And why not? It’s
  inexpensive with a simple, failsafe design, offering quick, mess-free
  convenience. This Sistema version has a large 2.6-litre capacity, suitable for
  feeding a family, and uses a pressure-chamber tray to draw away overflow
  liquid for perfect steamed rice and couscous. It’s also dishwasher- and
  freezer-safe. Why we love it I wasn’t anticipating this to compare favourably
  with the expensive electric rice cookers I tested, but it actually does. Using
  its suggested ratios and timings, my basmati emerged after 15 minutes with
  individual fragrant grains, with no starchiness or chalky middle. Other rice
  varieties weren’t mentioned in the instructions, but sushi rice worked well
  using the same method. For brown rice, I added another five minutes and was
  successful. If you’re nervous about cooking rice in a pan, then I highly
  recommend trying one of these. It guarantees results without having to put
  your hand too far into your pocket. For anyone concerned about Pfas – the
  “forever chemicals” in some plastics – this cooker is made from safe
  polypropylene. It’s a shame that … it gets so hot. It’s been in the microwave
  for 10 to 15 minutes, so there’s no getting around this. Much is made of the
  “easy lift handles”, but you’ll still need oven gloves to handle the container
  until it cools. Claimed number of portions: three to four Time to cook one cup
  of basmati rice: 15mins Dimensions: 21.6 x 21.6 x 16.4 (WDH) Capacity: 2.6l
  External temperature at end of cook: 85C *** Best mini rice cooker: Yum Asia
  Panda mini rice cooker £94.90 at Yum Asia £99.90 at Amazon Yum Asia’s cute
  mini rice cooker isn’t just a pretty face. Despite its diminutive size, it can
  cook rice for up to three people and has four rice-cooking functions, plus
  another four settings: porridge, slow cooking, cake and steaming. It can also
  be set in advance and has an automatic keep warm setting. Yum Asia says the
  machine cooks rice using “advanced fuzzy logic” technology, which means it
  gauges the weight, content and water volume of your cook to adjust the
  temperature, steam level and rest time accordingly. Why we love it Yum Asia
  has done it again with this rice cooker. You can’t fail to turn out the best
  rice you’ve ever made with one of these on your worktop. Basmati, sushi, brown
  rice and jasmine were all fantastic, cooking silently and mess-free with
  minimal steam escaping. It’s brilliant. It’s a shame that … it takes quite a
  long time. One cup of basmati takes about 40 minutes, which is longer than
  most of the other rice cookers on test. Claimed number of portions: three Time
  to cook one cup of basmati rice: 40mins Dimensions: 22.5 x 30 x 21cm (WDH)
  Capacity: 0.6l External temperature at end of cook: 36C *** The best of the
  rest *** Cuckoo electric rice cooker CR-0351F £140.73 at Amazon Best for:
  sticky rice Cuckoo is a premium Korean brand that has been making rice cookers
  for more than 40 years. This model uses an intuitive four-step process of
  soaking, heating, steaming and resting rice based on the type selected. You
  can choose from eight settings, including various types of rice, congee and
  slow-cooked stews, with enough capacity for up to three people. It didn’t make
  the final cut because … I found it cooked sushi rice well, but some
  longer-grain varieties were slightly overcooked, with a lot of rice sticking
  to the pan. The instructions also seem to have been badly translated, and as a
  result, they’re confusing. It looks very cool on your worktop, though. Claimed
  number of portions: three; time to cook one cup of basmati rice: 40mins;
  dimensions: 20 x 29 x 22cm (WDH); capacity: 0.5l; external temperature at end
  of cook: 27C *** Lakeland mini electric rice cooker £34.99 at Lakeland £34.99
  at Amazon Best for: using on the go Lightweight and compact, this 500ml
  affordable rice cooker is ideal for taking to work for lunchtime-ready rice or
  walking in to creamy porridge ready for you in the office. It’s easy to use,
  cooks in 30 minutes and switches to keep-warm mode automatically. It’s not as
  sturdy or well-made as many of the other cookers on this list, but it does the
  job. It’s a good machine for a first foray into rice cooking. It didn’t make
  the final cut because … starch kept bubbling out of the steam vent, and it
  gave off a burning smell even though the rice was fine. Claimed number of
  portions: two; time to cook one cup of basmati rice: 30mins; dimensions: 16.5
  x 14.5 x 19cm (WDH); capacity: 0.5l; external temperature at end of cook: 41C
  *** Gastroback Rice Cooker Pro 62518 £79 at B&amp;Q £79 at Debenhams Best for:
  quick cooking This imposing German-made rice cooker is great for quickly
  preparing large amounts of rice. With a minimum two-cup capacity, this machine
  is best for catering for several people at a time or batch cooking. It cooked
  my basmati rice in 15 minutes and gave good results, despite not having
  guidelines for any particular rice varieties. It also works as a steamer and
  cooks porridge, although you’ll need to stir throughout and stick to only
  water to cook it. It didn’t make the final cut because … at this size and
  price, I’d like more functionality. Claimed number of portions: six; time to
  cook one cup of basmati rice: 15mins; dimensions: 31 x 29 x 29cm (WDH);
  capacity: 5l; external temperature at end of cook: 27C *** GreenPan Omni
  Cooker £159.95 at Harts Of Stur Best for: feeding a crowd GreenPan makes an
  outstanding slow cooker, so I was excited to try its Omni Cooker. It has lots
  of settings – sear/saute, stir-fry, sauce, simmer, steam, white rice, brown
  rice, grains, soup and keep warm – and a sizeable 5.6-litre capacity, perfect
  for family dinnertime. The rice programs take 50 minutes or more and are best
  for cooking large quantities. The basmati rice towards the bottom tended to
  crust and some was unevenly cooked, but the top layers fared better. This
  machine would be best used as a one-pot-meal maker – I’d suggest cooking
  plenty of rice layered with veg and a protein on top. It didn’t make the final
  cut because … the rice cook was uneven and took a long time. Claimed number of
  portions: six; time to cook one cup of basmati rice: 50mins; dimensions: 22.5
  x 34.8 x 21.5cm (WDH); capacity: 5.6l; external temperature at end of cook:
  43C *** What you need to know *** If you can’t get to grips with cooking rice
  in a pan, are keen to master different types of rice, or simply eat a lot of
  the stuff, then a rice cooker is a sensible investment. And while
  multi-cookers are extremely tempting, not all of them have nailed the rice
  cooking aspect in the way that dedicated appliances have done – proceed with
  caution. If you haven’t got cash to splash, then a machine for about £30 will
  do the trick perfectly well – or consider a microwave rice cooker to see how
  much you actually use it. Otherwise, I’d point you to one of the Yum Asia
  machines – real rice cooking mastery awaits. How long does rice take to cook
  in a rice cooker? Cooking rice in a saucepan typically takes about 15 minutes,
  and most rice cookers will take twice as long. You should also factor in that
  the quantity of rice to be cooked will affect the cooking time, increasing
  proportionally with larger batches. The type of rice should also be
  considered; white basmati is the quickest cook, while brown rice and sticky
  styles will take longer – up to about 50 minutes. Good rice cookers will
  carefully detail cook times for specific types of rice, and most have a
  keep-warm function so you shouldn’t be left with any dinnertime disasters as
  long as you plan in advance. *** Joanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle

And while multi-cookers are extremely tempting, not all of them have nailed the rice cooking aspect in the way that dedicated appliances have done – proceed with caution. If you haven’t got cash to splash, then a machine for about £30 will do the trick perfectly well – or consider a microwave rice cooker to see how much you actually use it. Otherwise, I’d point you to one of the Yum Asia machines – real rice cooking mastery awaits. How long does rice take to cook in a rice cooker? Cooking rice in a saucepan typically takes about 15 minutes, and most rice cookers will take twice as long. You should also factor in that the quantity of rice to be cooked will affect the cooking time, increasing proportionally with larger batches. The type of rice should also be considered; white basmati is the quickest cook, while brown rice and sticky styles will take longer – up to about 50 minutes. Good rice cookers will carefully detail cook times for specific types of rice, and most have a keep-warm function so you shouldn’t be left with any dinnertime disasters as long as you plan in advance. *** Joanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.
