  to extinction

  The residents of Tecolutilla, Mexico, knew the heatwave was bad when they
  heard the thuds. One by one, the town’s howler monkeys, overcome with
  dehydration and exhaustion, were falling from the trees like apples, their
  limp bodies smacking the ground as temperatures sizzled past 43C (110F) in
  spring last year. Those that survived were given ice and intravenous drips by
  rescuers. At least 83 of the primates were found dead in the state of Tabasco,
  though local veterinarians estimated hundreds throughout the region probably
  perished. Episodes such as this are unfolding across the world as the climate
  crisis delivers harsher and more frequent heatwaves. Flying foxes have tumbled
  from trees in Australia; billions of barnacles have baked in tide pools in
  Canada; male beetles have been virtually sterilised by soaring temperatures.
  Beyond these local die-offs, ecologists are only just beginning to grasp the
  full threat that extreme heat poses to the world’s wildlife populations, and
  how quickly it can drive species towards extinction. Maximilian Kotz, a
  climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, says:
  “As human emissions shift the temperature distribution upwards, this manifests
  as a strong increase in the number of very hot days – not just an increase in
  average temperatures.” While the steady drumbeat of climbing average
  temperatures has long been expected to push species out of their preferred
  habitats and make food scarce, these episodes of blistering heat constitute a
  unique threat to wildlife, scientists say. Heatwaves are reaping such
  long-term population crashes in some regions that experts say the climate
  emergency has become a driver of biodiversity loss on a par with – or worse
  than – deforestation and habitat loss. Recently, Kotz and his colleagues dug
  through decades of global monitoring data on more than 3,000 bird populations
  and daily weather records to tease out whether heatwaves had contributed to
  observed declines in some parts of the world. After controlling for other
  factors, they found bird populations in temperate, boreal and tundra zones did
  not seem to suffer much from scorching heat. But for those in the tropics, the
  findings were sobering: extreme heat had slashed tropical bird populations by
  25% to 38% over the past 70 years. Tropical songbirds, they found, were hit
  hardest. The losses in the tropics have been so profound, in part, because
  species there are already living near their limit of heat tolerance, Kotz
  says. At the same time, birds in tropical regions are experiencing dangerously
  hot days about 10 times more often than they did in the past. “Heatwave
  frequency has just increased that much more quickly in the tropics,” Kotz
  says. Exactly how heatwaves drive population declines is not clear from their
  study, published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution. But Kotz says it is likely
  to be a combination of birds dying during heatwaves, heat stress in nests and
  eggs, and effects on the birds’ food, such as insects, which similarly
  struggle to survive soaring temperatures. Their research suggests that across
  the tropics changes to the climate have played a greater role in driving bird
  numbers down than direct human activities, such as logging, mining or farming.
  “For many of these species that are in protected areas in pristine habitats,
  there can still be really substantial effects from intensifying heat extremes
  through our greenhouse gas emissions,” Kotz says. When a heat dome descended
  on the Pacific north-west in the summer of 2021, unleashing air temperatures
  above 46C (116F), scientists walking the beaches along the strait of Georgia,
  off Vancouver Island, were horrified to find tide pools containing thousands
  of lifeless molluscs and barnacles. Attached to rocks, the creatures were
  unable to escape to cooler waters. Billions of animals dead At the time, Prof
  Christopher Harley, a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia,
  estimated the heatwave had killed 1 billion animals along the coast. “I was
  nervous making that estimate publicly because it was a bit back of the
  envelope,” he says, but now adds that they underestimated the toll. “We now
  have better numbers for that: we estimate 10 billion barnacles and 3 billion
  mussels [died] just in the strait of Georgia.” Harley says that while deaths
  in the billions may sound like an extinction-level event, abundant and
  fast-reproducing tidal species have proved surprisingly resilient. “The
  barnacles came back really fast. It took a few more years for the mussels to
  start creeping back in,” he says. “But if you went out to the shore of
  Vancouver right now, you wouldn’t immediately think, ‘There was a disaster
  here four years ago’.” Those animals that managed to survive the heatwave may
  also be slightly better adapted to extreme temperatures, meaning their
  offspring could carry that same tolerance. Other coastal species that thrive
  at the ebb and flow of the ocean, such as starfish, may have crawled into
  cooler waters when the heatwave took hold, Harley says. But among those that
  perished, it could take decades to recover the more slow-reproducing species.
  Harley’s preliminary data also examines the outcomes for insect populations.
  Honeybees appeared to have fared well, he says, but “aphids had a really tough
  go”. It fits with global research that finds temperature extremes can cause a
  mix of reactions among insect species, from outbreaks to breakdowns. In a 2020
  research review paper in Global Change Biology, scientists noted that many of
  the world’s insects were unable to regulate their body temperature during
  heatwaves because they mimicked ambient temperatures. Extreme heat can
  therefore push species beyond their limits. Yet heatwaves can also trigger a
  temporary outbreak: a dramatic increase in a population that quickly burns
  through local food sources and ultimately causes a crash. This, the authors
  noted, could lead to local insect extinctions. How heat changes animal bodies
  Epidemiologists have clearly established how heatwaves affect humans, but
  there has been scant research exploring the physiological consequences for
  non-human mammals. PJ Jacobs, an evolutionary biologist at the University of
  Pretoria in South Africa, is trying to close that gap. His recent research has
  focused on small mammals, which are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because
  of their larger surface area to volume ratio, which means they heat up more
  easily. In a study published last December, Jacobs examined the effects of
  heatwaves on small African rodents – the mesic four-striped field mouse and
  Namaqua rock mouse. He simulated a heatwave in a lab to test how the fertility
  of the male mice would be affected. Both experienced a serious drop in
  testosterone levels and other fertility measures. This, Jacobs says, suggests
  that intensifying heatwaves could jeopardise the ability of small animals to
  reproduce, potentially shrinking populations if they cannot access cooler
  refuges, such as shady spots or grassy shelters. That could have a serious
  effect further up the food chain. Heatwaves also affect animals at a
  behavioural level that poses limits to survival. “If there’s a massive
  heatwave happening, animals are not just going to go out and be active when
  temperatures are so extreme,” Jacobs says. “They have to rest in the shade
  which means they can’t go and do other things related to their fitness –
  reproduction and feeding.” At the same time, he adds, “If you hit those severe
  temperature extremes, you’re going to get those effects at the physiological
  and molecular level. That’s going to cause disorientation and dehydration. And
  you just collapse – you faint.” Even when the lab mice sought water to cool
  down, “the brain was the one tissue that was still affected”, says Jacobs.
  “The brain is obviously the control box of the body. If the brain doesn’t
  function properly, you’re going to have monkeys falling out of trees.” Find
