  As I head over the top of the pass from Corris, the great mass of Cadair Idris
  emerges against a leaden sky. The steep crags that stand above the thickly
  wooded slopes are coloured a deep purple by the flowering heather, but the
  usual vibrancy is subdued by the flat, almost sullen, light. Getting off the
  bus at Minffordd, I wander up the avenue of chestnut trees that form such an
  impressive welcome to the mountain. A drift of dry, discoloured leaves stands
  at the edge of the path, something I wouldn’t expect to see for another month
  or so, suggesting that the trees are suffering water-stress after the dry
  summer. I pause at the foot of the gorge, listening to the gentle – too gentle
  – sound of water burbling over the rocks. This stream drains from Llyn Cau, a
  corrie lake, far above and my target for the day’s walk. The steep Minffordd
  Path stays near the water for much of the route, sidling across the densely
  wooded hillside and incorporating roots, rock steps and outcrops at every
  turn. In the heavy heat, even the woodland birds remain quiet as I climb. The
  steepness of the trail reflects the glacial origins of the valley, scoured
  into a U-shaped trough by the repeated invasions of deep, westward-moving ice.
  In the dank woodland, sounds are softened by the surrounding vegetation and
  leaf litter. Fallen trees lie matted with moss, a supportive matrix now home
  to finger-high oak trees growing upwards towards holes in the canopy. Patches
  of fern display mature fans of leaves, the undersides dotted with spores that
  break free as you brush past. Glancing at my watch, I realise that the climb
  is taking much longer than it used to and I’m increasingly aware of the weight
  of my pack. I mentally map out the distance remaining to the lake, wondering
  if I’ve been overoptimistic. Maybe the stile at the top of the gorge, with the
  long view down the valley, would be a better target? Sighing inwardly, I wait
  for a cheerful group of young folk to canter uphill past me, then apply myself
  again to the climb. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s
