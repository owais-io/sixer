  Russian hackers took control of a Norwegian dam this year, opening a floodgate
  and allowing water to flow unnoticed for four hours, Norway’s intelligence
  service has said. The admission, by the Norwegian Police Security Service
  (PST), marks the first time that Oslo has formally attributed the cyber-attack
  in April on Bremanger, western Norway, to Moscow. The attack on the dam, which
  which is used for farming fish, released 500 litres (132 gallons) of water a
  second for four hours until the incident was detected and stopped. The head of
  PST, Beate Gangås, said on Wednesday: “Over the past year, we have seen a
  change in activity from pro-Russian cyber actors.” The Bremanger incident was
  an example of such an attack, she added. “The aim of this type of operation is
  to influence and to cause fear and chaos among the general population. Our
  Russian neighbour has become more dangerous.” The incident did not cause any
  injuries or damage because the water level of the river and the dam, which is
  close to the town of Svelgen, was a long way below flood capacity. The alleged
  perpetrators reportedly published a three-minute video, watermarked with the
  name of a pro-Russian cybercriminal group, on Telegram on the day of the
  attack. Kripos, Norway’s organised crime police unit, told the Aftenposten
  newspaper it was “aware this group brought together several actors who commit
  crime in the cyber domain” and had been linked to several cyber-attacks
  against businesses in the west in recent years. Gangås said: “Russian
  intelligence services spend significant resources identifying, cultivating and
  recruiting contacts in Norway. Norwegian citizens could be good sources of
  information for them.” Intelligence services in Norway, which produces the
  majority of its electricity using hydropower dams, had previously warned of
  the potential risk of such attacks on energy infrastructure. Norway and Russia
  share a 123-mile (198km) border, with a crossing at Storskog, Europe’s only
  open Schengen border with Russia. The Russian embassy in Oslo said Gangås’s
  statements were “unfounded and politically motivated”. It told Reuters news
  agency: “It is obvious that the PST is unsuccessfully trying to substantiate
  the mythical threat of Russian sabotage against Norwegian infrastructure this
  year, which it itself invented in its February (annual) report.” Last year,
  Richard Moore, the head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, accused
  Russia of a “staggeringly reckless campaign” of sabotage in Europe, in part to
  frighten countries from helping Ukraine. Moscow denies the allegation. The PST
  has been contacted for comment. • This article was amended on 15 August 2025.
  An earlier version said that the cyber-attack was on an electricity-producing
  hydropower dam. In fact, this dam is used for fish farming.
