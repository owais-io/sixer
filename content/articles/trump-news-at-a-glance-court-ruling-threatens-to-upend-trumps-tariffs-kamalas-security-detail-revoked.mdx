  A US federal appeals court has ruled that most of president Donald Trump’s
  tariffs are illegal, describing the levies as “unbounded in scope, amount and
  duration”. The ruling, which will take effect on 14 October, is the biggest
  blow yet to Trump’s tariff policy and will likely mean the supreme court will
  have to rule on whether Trump has the legal right as president to upend US
  trade policy. Reacting to the decision on social media, the president said:
  “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” If allowed to stand, the ruling would
  “literally destroy the United States of America”, he added. The president on
  Friday also revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president
  and 2024 election rival Kamala Harris after it was extended by Joe Biden
  before he left office. The move has been slammed by some as “another act of
  revenge”. Here are the key stories: Most of Trump’s tariffs are illegal,
  federal court rules Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most
  of his globe-rattling tariff policies, a federal appeals court in Washington
  DC ruled on Friday. US law “bestows significant authority on the president to
  undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency,
  but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs,
  duties, or the like, or the power to tax”, the court said. Many of Trump’s
  steep tariffs “are unbounded in scope, amount and duration”, the ruling added,
  and “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of
  the law his administration has leaned on. Read the full story Trump revokes
  Kamala Harris’s Secret Service detail extended by Biden Donald Trump has
  revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024
  Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. The letter, dated on Thursday
  and titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security”, instructs the
  Secret Service to “discontinue any security-related procedures beyond those
  required by law” effective 1 September 2025. Read the full story US denies
  visas to Palestinian Authority leaders for UN general assembly The US has
  begun denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation
  Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) ahead of the United
  Nations general assembly meeting in September, the state department said on
  Friday. “The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national
  security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with
  their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,” it said in a
  statement. Read the full story Trump bypasses Congress to cancel $4.9bn in
  foreign aid Donald Trump has told the House speaker, Mike Johnson, that he
  won’t be spending $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, in effect
  cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch. Read the full
  story RFK Jr peddles dubious health claims amid CDC crisis In a week of chaos
  at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Donald Trump’s health
  secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has continued to make questionable medical and
  health claims – and has been slammed for them by experts and lawmakers alike.
  After the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis this week where two
  children were killed and 17 others injured, Kennedy suggested that psychiatric
  drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun violence across the country. This
  week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify “mitochondrial challenges”
  in children at airports just by looking at them. Read the full story Trump
  looks to tighten visa durations for foreign students and journalists The Trump
  administration aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural
  exchange visitors and members of the media, according to a proposed government
  regulation issued on Wednesday, part of a broader crackdown on legal
  immigration. Read the full story Mother of boy, 15, held at gunpoint by US
  immigration agents files $1m claim The mother of a 15-year-old boy who was
  detained at gunpoint by federal immigration agents is seeking $1m in damages
  and accusing the Trump administration of false imprisonment and
  “unconstitutional racial profiling”. The teenager, a US citizen with
  disabilities, was in a vehicle with his mother outside Arleta high school in
  Los Angeles on 11 August when masked immigration agents surrounded them and
  pulled them from the vehicle. They said the boy was a suspect in a crime and
  handcuffed him for several minutes until they realized they had the wrong
  person, the Los Angeles Times reported. Read the full story What else happened
  today: Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs would be barred from
  performing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, under new rules
  proposed by the Trump administration. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has
  signed a new redistricting bill that will redraw the state’s congressional map
  to heavily favor Republicans. On Friday, Abbott signed the highly
  controversial bill, which prompted state Democrats to stage a weeks-long
  walkout earlier this month. Neil Young has released a new song lambasting
  Donald Trump, entitled Big Crime. The Canadian-American rocker has long been a
  critic of the US president, suing him (but later dropping the lawsuit) over
  the use of his songs at campaign rallies and calling him “the worst president
  in the history of our great country”. Catching up? Here’s what happened 28
  August 2025.
