  Belgian theatre collective FC Bergman’s take on “the crisis of modernity” in
  this show, which travels from the ancient world to mechanisation, is nothing
  if not wild. The boards of the stage are dug up with a plough at the start – a
  sign of things to come. A chicken is bashed in a sack as part of a pagan
  sacrifice (the real chicken remains unharmed), a naked man emerges from within
  an animal’s carcass and there is an apocalyptic landscape of erupting
  pineapples. It’s wacky, but stays just on the right side of reckless. Directed
  by Stef Aerts, Joé Agemans, Thomas Verstraeten and Marie Vinck, and part of
  the Edinburgh international festival, this is a wordless piece, based on
  muscular movement and stunning live music composed by Joachim Badenhorst and
  Sean Carpio. The arresting scenes mark the arc of human progress, from the
  taking up of tools onwards. When the industrial age dawns, a steam engine is
  shown with human limbs wrapped around it, as if they are extensions of the
  machine. The title refers to a poem by Hesiod on agrarian culture, for what
  that’s worth, but the narrative stays oblique. Yet you feel the changing mood.
  There are revels and fertility rites when actors’ trousers are unbuttoned,
  skirts raised. One couple literally roll in a sack. Spiritual ceremonies are
  enacted, too, and spinning around fire. There is a construction phase, with
  nature tamed and a chorus of hammers on wood, a storm of sawdust. A house-like
  structure is erected from this industriousness. Civilisation arrives as
  animals are gutted, with fluttering red scarves standing in for blood and
  viscera. Performers, including Aerts, Agemans, Verstraeten and Vinck, plus
  Susan De Ceuster, Geert Goossens, Fumiyo Ikeda and Maryam Sserwamukoko, are as
  physical as dancers. There is an almost constant shaking, pounding, swirling
  on stage, and beauty, too, in some of the scenes, but it is invariably
  interrupted by savagery – a large animal, maybe an elephant, is eviscerated
  and strung up – or a violent sound. The sonic effects are enthralling, with
  instruments used in original ways: two flutes taped together, a table harp and
  saxophone that sounds like a didgeridoo, six Tibetan singing bowls fused as
  one and played with a bow and mallet … The music is inspired by Vivaldi’s Four
  Seasons, but seems so much stranger. The lighting, by Aerts, Agemans and Ken
  Hioco, is magnificent, too, with swarms of blackness and columns of light. Is
  this theatre, installation or dance? Who knows. As indefinable as it may be,
  it arrests. AI raises its head in the final moments. It is funny but
  unnerving. The endpoint of progress, it seems, is arriving. • At the Lyceum,
  Edinburgh, until 10 August. Edinburgh international festival runs until 24
  August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
