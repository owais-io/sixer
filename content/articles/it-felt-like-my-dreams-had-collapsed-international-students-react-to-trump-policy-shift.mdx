  As the new academic year is about to begin at most universities across the
  United States, many international students are navigating a mix of anxiety and
  uncertainty as the Trump administration’s crackdown on higher education and
  immigration continues. The Guardian asked international students studying in
  the US to share how they are feeling as they prepare to return to campus. Some
  described how policy shifts have derailed their academic plans, while others
  said that they were now reconsidering whether the US is a place where they
  want to pursue their academic futures. “Leaving the US after I receive my
  degree is increasingly a top priority,” said Andre Fa’aoso, a 20-year-old
  student from Auckland, New Zealand, who is entering his third year at Yale
  University. “I have not been thinking too far into the future because I know
  policy settings are subject to change overnight, and I might wake up to find
  Yale at the center of a feud with the administration, with my right to study
  and remain in the US used as a pawn to leverage concessions from
  universities.” While Fa’aoso is looking forward to resuming his studies, he
  said that his return to the US “is shadowed by a genuine nervousness about
  what it may be like to go through the US border in just over two weeks”. “I am
  remaining optimistic that I will go through without a hitch,” he said, adding:
  “But a part of me has been preparing for what might happen if I get pulled
  into secondary screening or detained for some arbitrary reason, and I’m not
  alone in that thought process.” One student from Singapore, who attends
  college in Columbus, Ohio, said they spent the summer at home and felt “scared
  and nervous” to return to the US this fall despite having “a visa and no legal
  problems”. “I am a law-abiding person and make sure I avoid being near
  protests,” the student, who asked to remain anonymous out of safety concerns,
  said. “I will be more careful and keep my documents with me but I still am
  scared about being taken due to what I see on the news.” Another student, who
  said they were from eastern Europe and were about to begin graduate studies at
  the Harvard School of Public Health this fall, echoed similar concerns. The
  student, who asked to remain anonymous, wrote that despite living in the US
  for a decade and holding a valid visa, they were “worried” about passing
  through US customs as they head to the US after returning home for the summer.
  Since retaking office, Donald Trump and his administration have made efforts
  to reshape higher education, targeting some of the country’s top universities
  and implementing a series of policy changes that have greatly affected
  international students. The administration has halted and delayed student visa
  processing, revoked and later reinstated the legal status of hundreds of
  international students, expanded social media screenings for visa applicants,
  imposed new travel bans, slashed university research funding, arrested and
  detained several international students involved in pro-Palestinian campus
  activism and announced plans to start “aggressively” revoking the visas of
  some Chinese students. The administration also attempted to block Harvard from
  enrolling international students, triggering a legal battle in which the
  university has accused the White House of unconstitutional retaliation for
  defying its political demands. As of last academic year, more than 1.1 million
  international students were enrolled in US colleges and universities, making
  up roughly 6% of the student population. But a May 2025 survey found that
  interest in studying in the US among international students has fallen to its
  lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic. A recent analysis by Nafsa, a
  non-profit association of international educators, projected that US
  universities could see a 30% to 40% decline in new international enrollment
  this upcoming academic year, which would lead to a 15% drop in overall
  enrollment this fall. Nafsa attributed the decline to the travel ban,
  disruptions in visa interviews and processing, limited visa appointment
  availability and the new vetting procedures. Notably, a decline in
  international student enrollment could pose a financial threat to many
  universities. International students often pay as much as two to three times
  the tuition of domestic students and according to Nafsa, contribute roughly
  $43bn annually to the US economy. Many of the respondents to the Guardian’s
  callout were Iranian scholars, who detailed how their academic dreams were
  upended by the travel ban introduced in June. That ban restricts nationals
  from 12 countries, including Iran, from coming to the US. Romina Ayoubi, a
  23-year-old Iranian scholar, said that she was accepted into a PhD program at
  Columbia University set to start this fall and “had so many difficulties”
  obtaining a US visa. She said she was forced to go to a nearby country for the
  interview as Iran doesn’t have a US embassy. Now, she can’t even attend. “It
  is very disappointing to see that all my peers are excited to start their
  academic journey in NYC and Columbia, and I am the only one who can’t be with
  them just because I’m Iranian,” Ayoubi said, adding: “I’m very determined
  about doing research in the best university of New York, and I hope that this
  situation will be better as soon as possible.” Mahya, a 27-year-old
  veterinarian from Iran, said that she secured a fully funded graduate position
  at Ohio State University. Her visa was issued in April so she booked her
  flight and rented a home in Columbus. Then, in early summer, she received an
  email from the embassy “informing me about the additional processing and that
  my visa is no longer valid”. “I had to cancel my lease, my flight, and wait
  for the embassy’s response,” she said. Not long after, “the travel ban came up
  and it was like all my dreams were worth nothing.” Mahya said that she was
  “trying to stay calm and optimistic” and hoped that she would be able to “make
  it for the next semester to start achieving my academic goals at the Ohio
  State University”. Several other Iranian students said that they’ had deferred
  their enrollment, hoping for future policy changes. Donya Movahedi Noghani, a
  36-year-old Iranian citizen, said she was accepted to a PhD program at Purdue
  University but was also unable to secure a visa due to the restrictions. “It
  felt like my dreams had collapsed,” she said. Now, Movahedi Noghani said she
  had received an offer from a university in Canada, and intends to pursue her
  education there instead. Other Iranian students described feeling “hopeless”.
  “All we ask for is the opportunity to pursue our goals, and to be judged by
  our potential, not our nationality,” one Iranian student who asked to remain
  anonymous, wrote. Another added, “every day, it feels like my dreams of
  studying in the US slip further away”. “What’s happening now isn’t just about
  border control or national security,” they added. “It’s about lives, potential
  and global cooperation, we chose the US because of its academic excellence and
  its promise of opportunity, but as other countries become more welcoming, the
  US risks losing not only talent, but goodwill.”
