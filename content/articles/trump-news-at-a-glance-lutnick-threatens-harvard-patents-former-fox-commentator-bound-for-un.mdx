  The Trump administrations has threatened Harvard’s lucrative portfolio of
  patents amid its long-running dispute with the university, accusing it of
  breaching legal and contractual requirements tied to federally funded
  research. In a letter, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick demanded that Harvard
  provide within four weeks a list of all patents stemming from federally funded
  research grants, including how the patents are used and whether any licensing
  requires “substantial US manufacturing”. Harvard did not immediately respond
  to requests for comment. Many civil rights experts, faculty and White House
  critics believe the Trump administration’s targeting of schools for supposedly
  failing to address antisemitism on campus is a pretext to assert federal
  control and threaten academic freedom and free speech. Trump administration
  threatens Harvard federal funding and patents In his letter to Harvard,
  Lutnick also said the commerce department had begun a “march-in” process under
  the federal Bayh-Dole Act that could let the government take ownership of the
  patents or grant licenses. As of 1 July 2024, Harvard held more than 5,800
  patents, and had more than 900 technology licenses with over 650 industry
  partners, according to the Harvard Office of Technology Development. Read the

  said on Saturday he was nominating former Fox News commentator Tammy Bruce as
  the next US deputy representative to the United Nations. Bruce has been
  serving as the chief spokesperson for the state department since Trump took
  office this year. Trump said Bruce, who had no prior foreign policy experience
  before becoming spokesperson in January, “will represent our country
  brilliantly at the United Nations”. Read the full story IRS commissioner
  reportedly removed over immigration policy dispute The removal of the Internal
  Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner Billy Long after just two months came after
  the federal tax collection agency said it could not release some information
  on taxpayers suspected of being in the US illegally, it was reported on
  Saturday. The Washington Post reported the Department of Homeland Security had
  sent the IRS a list of 40,000 names that it suspected of being in the country
  illegally. DHS asked the tax service to crosscheck confidential taxpayer data
  to verify their addresses. The IRS reportedly responded that it was able to
  verify fewer than 3% of the names on the DHS list, but declined requests for
  further information, citing taxpayer privacy rights. Read the full story ‘We
  are at war – bring it on’: Democrats ready to fight dirty to stop Trump Ken
  Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, speaking in Chicago this
  week, said: “This is a new Democratic party. We’re bringing a knife to a knife
  fight, and we are going to fight fire with fire.” It was a brutally honest
  acknowledgement of what a decade of Donald Trump’s politics has wrought. Out
  go the courtly and courteous playing-by-the-rules Democrats convinced that
  Maga is a passing phase, a fever that will break. In come a new generation of
  pugnacious Democrats prepared to take off the gloves and fight dirty. The
  trigger for this scorched-earth approach is Trump’s push to find more
  Republican seats in the House of Representatives ahead of next year’s crucial
  midterm elections through gerrymandering, a process of manipulating electoral
  maps to benefit one party over another. Read the full story How did we get all
  this gerrymandering? A brief history Extreme GOP gerrymanders have remade
  American politics over the last 15 years. They have locked Republicans into
  office in state legislatures nationwide, even in purple states when Democratic
  candidates win more votes. They have delivered a reliable and enduring edge to
  the GOP in the race for Congress. How did we get here? How did gerrymandered
  lines, rather than voters, gain the power to determine winners and losers?

  allowed to vote The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, recently shared a
  video in which several pastors say women should no longer be allowed to vote,
  prompting one progressive evangelical organization to express concern. Hegseth
  reposted a nearly seven-minute report CNN segment on X on Thursday that
  focuses on pastor Doug Wilson, a Christian nationalist. In the segment, he
  raises the idea of women not voting. Doug Pagitt, a pastor and the executive
  director of the progressive evangelical organization Vote Common Good, said
  the ideas in the video were views that “small fringes of Christians keep” and
  said it was “very disturbing” that Hegseth would amplify them. Read the full

  returning to his role overseeing vaccine, gene therapy and blood product
  regulation at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a little more than a
  week after he left the agency. Two days before Prasad stepped down last month,
  Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist, had released
  misleadingly edited audio to suggest Prasad had admitted sticking pins in a
  Trump voodoo doll, when the full audio made it clear that he was talking about
  the kind of thing an imagined liberal Trump-hater would do. Prasad is an
  oncologist who was a fierce critic of US Covid-19 vaccines and mask mandates.

  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta on Friday,
  killing a police officer, had blamed a Covid-19 vaccine for making him
  depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official said. Documents filed
  recently in the New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese’s five-year bankruptcy
  case provide more clarity on how claims will be doled out to survivors of
  clergy abuse if a proposed settlement is approved. Catching up? Here’s what
  happened on 8 August 2025.
