  Shares in the US footwear company Crocs have slumped by almost 30% after it
  warned of falling sales because of tariffs, “super cautious” US consumers and
  signs the “ugly shoe” trend could be on the wane. The foam clog and sandal
  maker’s shares fell by 29.2% on Thursday, after it predicted revenues could
  drop by between 9% and 11% in the current quarter, disappointing analysts who
  were expecting slight growth. It also warned of a hit to profitability from
  Donald Trump’s tariffs – the latest wave of which came into force earlier that
  day – citing “continued uncertainty from evolving global trade policy and
  related pressures around the consumer”. The share price plunge was its biggest
  one-day drop since 2011, taking its valuation to its lowest level for almost
  three years. Andrew Rees, the chief executive, said there was “ample evidence”
  that some consumers in North America were “super cautious; they’re not
  purchasing, they’re not even going to the stores, and we see traffic down”. He
  explained that “already choiceful” Americans were worried about current and
  future price increases. Rees described the environment in the second half of
  the year as “concerning” and said that was clearly reflected in orders from
  the company’s retail partners. A cooling labour market, along with higher
  interest rates, rising inflation and uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies
  and his tax bill have led to Americans reining in their spending. Once
  considered a fashion faux pas, sales of Crocs soared during the coronavirus
  pandemic when people sought out more comfortable footwear, and a gold pair of
  Crocs appeared on the Oscars red carpet in 2021. Earlier this week, Microsoft
  launched special anniversary edition Windows XP-themed Crocs. Crocs are made
  from a lightweight and odour-resistant special foam resin, and were initially
  marketed to sailors and water sport enthusiasts before they became more
  popular in the mid-00s. However, while Crocs have a broad appeal and are worn
  by celebrities including Drew Barrymore, Rees acknowledged customer tastes
  were changing with a trend “back towards athletic” footwear in favour of
  sports brands, before the men’s football World Cup next year and the Los
  Angeles Olympics in 2028. Susan Healy, the chief financial officer, said
  tariffs would result in a $40m (£29.8m) hit in the second half of 2025 and
  $90m on an annual basis based on the company’s current sourcing mix. Rees
  flagged a disproportionate impact of tariffs on its casual footwear HEYDUDE
  brand, acquired in late 2021. He said the company was taking measures such as
  keeping a close eye on expenses and reducing inventory “to protect brand
  health and profitability”, and had pulled back on promotions since May. The
  Colorado-based company fell into the red in the second quarter with a pre-tax
  loss of $448.6m, compared with a profit of $296.4m the year before. Revenues
  rose by 3.4% to $1.1bn. McDonald’s said this week that US customers on lower
  incomes were cutting back on fast food to save money. On Thursday, the fashion
  company Ralph Lauren said that while it had raised its full-year revenue
  outlook, it was “maintaining continued caution” on the global environment as
  it wanted to see “how consumers respond to the start of the fall holiday
  season and what will be an uncertain, potentially inflationary environment”.
