  Netflix Black Rabbit TV, US, 2025 – out 18 September “Everything’s falling
  apart,” says Jude Law’s restaurateur Jake Friedkin in Netflix’s new thriller
  series – which is bad for him, but good for the audience. Who doesn’t like to
  watch somebody else’s life go off the rails? Jake’s woes stem from Vince, his
  bad egg of a brother – played by Jason Bateman, who also directed the first
  two episodes. Vince returns to the family business; the restaurant is going
  gangbusters. But family have a way of creating chaos – particularly those,
  like Vince, who’ve racked up big debts and upset the wrong people. Not exactly
  new terrain for a crime series; let’s hope the staging feels fresh. AKA
  Charlie Sheen TV, US, 2025 – out 10 September Remember Charlie Sheen’s “tiger
  blood” era? Those words entered the pop culture lexicon in a legendary TV
  interview he gave in 2011, the same year he got fired from Two and a Half Men.
  This particularly tumultuous part of Sheen’s bumpy career must surely get
  special attention in Netflix’s two-part documentary, which promises to dip
  into the dirty and debaucherous – tracking the star’s “dazzling Hollywood
  rise, tabloid-topping fall and road to recovery”. Sheen is featured
  prominently, of course; he doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who wants to
  recede into the shadows. Honourable mentions: Wednesday season 2 part 2 (TV, 3
  September), Force of Nature: The Dry 2 (film, 11 September), The Wrong Paris
  (film, 12 September), Maledictions (TV, 12 September), Insidious: The Red Door
  (film, 15 September), Wayward (TV, 25 September), The Lost City of Melbourne
  (film, 30 September). Stan Revealed – Death Cap Murders TV, Australia, 2025 –
  out 14 September It’d be an exaggeration to say that Erin Patterson’s
  world-famous beef wellingtons were still warm when the scramble began to make
  productions about the murders she committed in 2023, but it certainly felt
  that way. ABC for instance began commissioning a drama series before her trial
  had even concluded. The documentary world enables much faster turnaround times
  – and so, here comes Stan’s three-part doco series, which promises to offer
  “exclusive access into the investigation and trial”. How exclusive, and how
  interesting, remains to be seen, but I’ll be watching. Life of Pi Film,
  US/UK/Taiwan, 2012 – out 20 September In any other film, a line like “your
  mother is the orangutan” would sound like an insult. But not in Ang Lee’s
  visually sumptuous adaptation of Yann Martel’s novel, which builds a
  spiritual, unashamedly religious-minded space, philosophically connecting
  humans and animals. Literally connecting them too, in the sense that a large
  swathe of the story takes place on a lifeboat shared between Pi (Suraj Sharma)
  and a Bengal tiger. I’m not a big fan of the framing device – an older Pi
  recounting his story to a writer – but Lee builds a lovely, ponderous sort of
  spectacle. Honourable mentions: 28 Days Later (film, 1 September), 28 Weeks
  Later (film, 1 September), Mao’s Last Dancer (film, 2 September), Pig (film, 5
  September), 10 Things I Hate About You (film, 13 September), Crocodile Dundee:
  The Encore Cut (film, 15 September), Oppenheimer (film, 22 September), A Most
  Violent Year (film, 23 September), The Social Network (film, 24 September),
  Walk the Line (film, 27 September), The Hack (date TBC). SBS on Demand The
  People vs Robodebt TV, Australia, 2025 – out 24 September SBS’ three-part
  series unpacking the Robodebt scandal deploys a high energy approach,
  combining interviews with victims, Centrelink employees, and various others
  (including Guardian Australia’s own Christopher Knaus) with extensive dramatic
  recreations directed by Ben Lawrence (Ithaka, Hearts and Bones). Initially I
  found these recreations a strange fit tonally, but warmed to them with time;
  they help the series explore emotional as well as factual details. The Man Who
  Wasn’t There Film, US – out 15 September With its sublime monochrome veneer
  and a gripping, The Outsider-esque story about a barber who shows no regret
  after committing murder, this cracking thriller from the Coen brothers seems
  unfairly overlooked in their admittedly very large and impressive oeuvre.
  Billy Bob Thornton is magnificent as Ed Crane, the barber who triggers a
  classic in-over-their-head narrative when he blackmails his bookkeeper wife’s
  boss. Crane’s extensive voiceover narration contrasts the much quieter and
  more reserved person we see on screen, throwing us into the mind of an
  introvert. Honourable mentions: The Old Way (film, 1 September), Sympathy for
  the Devil (film, 1 September), Barton Fink (film, 1 September), Shakespeare in
  Love (film, 1 September), Call My Agent (TV, 4 September), Dreaming Big (TV, 5
  September), The Red Shoes (film, 5 September), Black Narcissus (film, 5
  September), The Wedding Planner (film, 5 September), Code of Silence (TV, 10
  September), Gosford Park (film, 12 September), A Matter of Life and Death
  (film, 12 September), The Big Lebowski (film, 15 September), A Serious Man
  (film, 15 September), The Patient (TV, 24 September), Reservation Dogs seasons
  1-3 (TV, 25 September). ABC iView Mystery Road: Origin season two TV,
  Australia, 2025 – out 21 September Mark Coles Smith had very big cowboy shoes
  to fill when he took on the role of Jay Swan, the outback detective
  brilliantly played by Aaron Pedersen in two Mystery Road movies and two TV
  spin-offs. He more than delivered the goods in another small screen spin-off,
  Mystery Road: Origin, playing a much younger version of the iconic
  Akubra-wearing sleuth in a show that felt more like a six-hour film than an
  episodic series. The second season focuses on another case involving the shady
  history of a small town. Joining the cast is Robyn Malcolm, who gave a
  wall-rattling performance in last year’s shockingly good New Zealand drama
  After the Party. Honourable mentions: Britain’s Great Cathedrals (TV, 14
  September), PNG The Road to Independence (TV, 16 September), Mother and Son
  season 2 (TV, 24 September). Amazon Prime Video Top End Bub TV, Australia,
  2025 – out 12 September I enjoyed, but didn’t love, the 2019 Australian romcom
  Top End Wedding, starring the ever-likable Miranda Tapsell as Lauren, a
  bride-to-be scrambling to track down her missing mother before tying the knot
  with her fiance, Ned, (Gwilym Lee). In this spin-off TV series, Lauren and
  Ned, who are happily married, unexpectedly become guardian parents to Lauren’s
  niece Taya (Gladys-May Kelly) after her sister dies in a car crash. Expect
  laughter, tears, and Important Life Lessons. Jerry Maguire Film, US, 1996 –
  out 16 September “SHOW ME THE MOOONNEEEYYY!” Tom Cruise plays the titular
  sports agent, who’s fired after taking a stand against dishonest practices in
  his industry. He’s supported by a colleague, Dorothy (Renée Zellweger), who
  jumps ship with him, though they retain only one client, Rod (Cuba Gooding
  Jr.), who plays for the NFL. Maybe, just maybe, Rod will defy the odds and
  become a lucratively paid mega star. Honourable mentions: (TV, 1 September),
  Ice Road: Vengeance (film, 3 September), Gone Girl (film, 5 September), Poor
  Things (film, 7 September), The Dry (film, 9 September), The Girlfriend (TV,
  10 September), Joker (film, 16 September), Hotel Costiera (TV, 24 September),
  The Bodyguard (film, 30 September), The Meg (film, 30 September), Crazy,
  Stupid, Love (film, 30 September), Kong: Skull Island (film, 30 September), 28
  Day Later (film, 30 September). Binge The Paper TV, US, 2025 – out 4 September
  All roads lead back to Scranton! This spin-off of The Office is based in the
  same universe as the long-running US version of the show, but focuses on a
  different company, set in the headquarters of a struggling newspaper. I’ve
  watched the first episode, which feels pretty meh, with no big belly-ups and
  jokes that feel quite obvious. When one journalist, Esmeralda (Sabrina
  Impacciatore), talks about an article she’s very proud of, the camera zooms in
  to reveal the headline: “You Won’t Believe How Much Ben Affleck Tipped His
  Limo Driver.” Ho ho ho. Maybe it finds a better rhythm. Honourable mentions:
  The Office Superfan Episodes, seasons 1-8 (TV, 1 September), Married … With
  Children season 1-11 (TV, 1 September), 28 Days Later (film, 1 September),
  Love Hurts (film, 14 September), Brilliant Jones: Mad About the Boy (film, 21
  September). HBO Max Task TV, US, 2025 – out 8 September The new series from
  Mare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby is set in working-class Philadelphia
  and stars Mark Ruffalo as Tom Brandis, a former priest and avid birdwatcher.
  Oh! And he’s also an FBI agent, leading a taskforce investigating a group who
  violently rob drug dealers, escalating tensions between rival gangs. Will his
  bird watching skills help save the day? The show’s been generating good buzz.
  Variety critic Alison Herman drew attention to its “nail-biting set pieces”
  and Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall called it “transportative“. Honourable
  mentions: Brian and Maggie (TV, 1 September) Ruby &amp; Jodi: A Cult of Sin
  and Influence (TV, 2 September), Most Wanted: Teen Hacker (TV, 5 September),
  Rocky (film, 1976), Rocky II (film, 1979), Rocky III (film, 1982), Rocky IV
  (film, 1985), Rocky V (film, 1990), Rocky Balboa (film, 2006), Tomb Raider
  (film, 2018), RoboCop (film, 2014), 21 Jump Street (film, 2012), 22 Jump
  Street (film, 2014). Disney+ Only Murders in the Building season 5 TV, US,
  2025 – out 9 September Another season, another murder, another round of
  banter-filled sleuthing from our favourite amateur investigators and
  podcasters – played by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. The
  chemistry between Martin and Short was established decades ago, and the
  addition of Gomez gives this frothy cosy murder series inter-generational
  appeal. The plot of the fifth season involves the trio investigating the death
  of their building’s doorman. All is not what it seems, of course; there are
  various sinister forces at play, yadda yadda. The fourth season brought the
  goods, though at this point the proverbial cow has been well milked. Will the
  show keep going until it jumps the shark? Let’s hope not. Honourable mentions:
  Lilo &amp; Stitch (film, 3 September), Futurama season 13 (TV, 16 September),
  High Potential season 2 (TV, 17 September), Swiped (film, 19 September), FX’s
  The Lowdown (TV, 24 September), Chad Powers (TV, 30 September). Apple TV+ The
  Savant TV, US, 2025 – out 26 September “The Savant” isn’t exactly a modest
  moniker for an investigator; it sets the bar rather high. Jessica Chastain
  plays the titular character, who spends her evenings hunched in front of a
  computer, infiltrating online hate groups in an attempt to prevent them from
  committing terrible crimes. The juiced-up trailer declares that “between 1994
  and 2020, 893 extremist attacks took place in America” and “today, unseen
  heroes protect us from countless more”. So she’s kind of like a
  keyboard-powered superhero? I guess I’m in. Honourable mentions: Highest 2
  Lowest (film, 5 September), Morning Wars season 4 (TV, 17 September), Slow
  Horses season 5 (TV, 24 September), All of You (film, 26 September).
