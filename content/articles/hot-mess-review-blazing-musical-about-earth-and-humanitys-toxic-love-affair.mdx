webTitle: Hot Mess review – blazing musical about Earth and humanity’s toxic love affair

  Does a musical romance with a climate message sound a tad worthy – and one in
  which the couple represent “Earth” and “Humanity”? In fact, Earth (Danielle
  Steers) is a Bridget Jones style singleton who is 750m years into looking for
  love. She is not convinced when Humanity (Tobias Turley) comes along, all
  earnestness and cute lines (“You are the centre of my universe”) but is slowly
  won over. Somehow, Jack Godfrey and Ellie Coote’s climate romcom manages not
  to make a hot mess out of a very bizarre idea. Quite the opposite. It is so
  well executed that you see the tragedy of Earth’s love affair with Humanity as
  a toxic relationship in which the latter betrays, manipulates and gaslights,
  even as you are dazzled by the music, tickled by the humour and taken in by
  the romance. It is a two-hander in which both performers blaze. Steers is
  armed with an out-of-this-world voice and a welter of well-timed one-liners
  (“I can literally pull anyone, it’s called gravity” and “I’m not picky, I’m
  naturally selective”). Turley is a formidable singer, too, and manages his
  character’s trajectory from wet-eared eagerness to workaholism, insecurity,
  unfaithfulness and denial. It serves as a metaphor for our abuse of the
  planet’s resources while making promises to do better, and be greener –
  tomorrow. But it is delivered without flat-footedness or strain, never
  breaking out of the storyline of its central romance. You know where it is all
  heading but it still manages to surprise and delight. Coote’s book whops out
  one brilliant line after another. Godfrey’s lyrics keep up while the music is
  super catchy, whether synth pop, rock, funk or moments of rap. The duo’s show
  42 Balloons was a runaway hit at the Lowry last year. This cements their
  extraordinary musical chemistry. Coote, who directs as well, keeps it pacy.
  Having played a run at the Birmingham Hippodrome earlier this year, the
  production is slick without being glib. A fringe highlight which, like the
  planet, deserves a longer, fuller life. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh,
  until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews • This article was
  amended on 8 August 2025. The musical 42 Balloons was performed at the Lowry
  in Salford, not at the Edinburgh fringe as an earlier version said.
