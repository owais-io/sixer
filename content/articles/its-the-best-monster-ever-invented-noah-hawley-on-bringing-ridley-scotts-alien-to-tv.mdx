  Alien to TV

  When it was first announced in 2013, the thought of Fargo being reimagined as
  a TV miniseries felt practically sacrilegious. The 1996 neo-noir starring
  Frances McDormand as a kindly Minnesota police chief was a singular film that
  had won two Oscars. Surely its distinctive Coen brothers vibe would get
  shredded in the woodchipper of TV adaptation? Back then, Noah Hawley, the
  screenwriter who took on the job, would have agreed. “It seemed like such a
  terrible idea,” he says via video call from a Long Island holiday bolthole.
  “Which is sort of why I liked it. The risk/reward was really high.” If his
  take on Fargo had sullied the original, Hawley jokes, he would have been
  “burned at the stake”. But his approach was more mindful reimagining than
  direct adaptation, with Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman leading a new
  small-town tale of malevolence and haplessness that perfectly captured the
  Coens’ essence. Fargo won three Emmys in 2014 – including outstanding limited
  series – and has continued as a star-studded anthology for another four
  seasons, with showrunner Hawley finding an intriguing new angle each time. If
  taking on Fargo was a big swing, Hawley’s latest franchise remix is a literal
  beast. Alien: Earth is a prequel series to the durable sci-fi franchise that
  began with Ridley Scott’s clammy 1979 horror. Despite numerous Alien movie
  sequels, crossovers and spin-offs, this is the first time the hissing,
  nightmarish xenomorph – “Maybe the best monster ever invented, cinematically,”
  Hawley suggests – has attempted to colonise TV. The approach had to be
  different from last year’s successful offshoot Alien: Romulus, a
  back-to-basics slasher picking up plot threads from Scott’s original. “An
  Alien movie is a two-hour survival story, so the monsters can just be
  monsters,” says Hawley. “But in a 10-hour, 30-hour, 50-hour show the monsters
  have to exist for a reason. You’re also not killing everybody off, so there
  has to be a continuing serialised story in which the monsters fit.” With the
  critical acclaim that greeted Fargo and his 2017 series Legion – a subversive
  take on the X-Men comic-book mythos that ran for three trippy seasons – Hawley
  has helped elevate expectations for small-screen offshoots of existing
  intellectual property. “The question is always: why are we doing this?” he
  says. “And if you can’t answer the ‘why?’ question with something other than
  ‘money’ then probably you should stop.” What used to be cash-grab brand
  extensions now increasingly strive to be prestige projects, as evidenced by
  recent blue-chip TV efforts such as HBO’s The Penguin and politically charged
  Star Wars hit Andor. Hawley is technically on holiday when we speak: he, his
  artist wife Kyle and their two teenage kids have swapped the summer heat of
  their Austin, Texas base for New York state. The 58-year-old looks beach-ready
  in a casual short-sleeve shirt, but is happy to dig into the guts of his own
  summer blockbuster. It has been gestating since 2018 when, after the success
  of Legion, the FX channel asked how he might approach an Alien show. “If you
  ask me if I have an idea, I’m gonna have an idea,” he says. From the lofty
  prequel Prometheus to a shlocky crossover in Alien vs Predator, the franchise
  timeline has become cluttered over the past 45 years. Hawley’s pitch zeroed in
  on unexplored territory: what was happening on Earth in the years just before
  the events of Alien. The result is a mashup of Peter Pan dreaminess and heavy
  metal doom, with a sprawling ensemble cast including Babou Ceesay as a
  poker-faced security officer and Timothy Olyphant as a blond android “synth”.
  It is set in 2120 – a couple of years before Sigourney Weaver and her
  blue-collar crew of space truckers will have their fateful close encounter –
  and the Earth has, rather plausibly, been carved up by a cabal of all-powerful
  tech corporations. Weyland-Yutani, the franchise’s longstanding corporate
  baddy, is obviously in the mix. But a pushy rival called Prodigy has secretly
  cracked transhumanism, decanting consciousness into powerful synth bodies. The
  catch is that only young minds are flexible enough for the process, so
  terminally ill kids are being reborn as herculean but emotionally immature
  “hybrids”. “If you’re telling a story about humanity there’s nobody more human
  than a child,” says Hawley. “They don’t know they’re bad liars, they can’t
  pretend they’re not scared and they learn to be cynical. So that was
  interesting to me.” When a hulking research vessel carrying unpleasant cosmic
  beasties crash-lands on a hi-tech city in Thailand, the hybrids are deployed
  on a search-and-rescue mission. “We’re fast, we’re strong and we don’t break,”
  points out lead hybrid Wendy, played with suitably childlike glee by Sydney
  Chandler (Pistol, Sugar). The stage is set for a corporate turf war amid a
  citywide state of emergency. Coming up with new aliens that could exist
  alongside the familiar xenomorph was “daunting” for Hawley. The aim was to
  evoke the feeling of watching Alien for the first time. “They don’t have to
  carry the day,” he says. “They just have to offer that feeling of
  unpredictability. By introducing these other creatures, I am able to give you
  a sense of: well, now I don’t know what’s going to happen.” After the fraught
  terrain of Fargo and Legion, where an emotional gut punch never felt far away,
  Alien: Earth feels like Hawley in a brasher, more swaggering mode. Classic
  Black Sabbath was a touchstone. “I wanted this show to be completely
  entertaining from start to finish,” he says. “It’s complex and layered but
  it’s also a cliffhanger show and you get those big feelings from hard rock and
  driving guitars. I want you to come out of each episode going: yeah, come on!”
  Hawley was born and grew up in New York City (he has a twin brother, Alexi,
  who has carved out his own career as a TV writer and producer). It was a
  creative household: his mother, Louise Armstrong, was a writer, painter and
  activist; his father trained as an actor. “We grew up in the West Village in
  the 70s and 80s when the only people down there were artists,” he says. “It
  was not the billionaire row that it is today.” After studying political
  science, Hawley worked as a paralegal while also playing in rock bands and
  dabbling in creative writing. At 27, he had moved to San Francisco and
  published his first novel. Despite getting a two-book deal he was struggling
  with the follow-up. “My editor had left, and the publisher wasn’t really
  interested in the book that I wrote,” he says, “so I was in kind of a
  desperate moment.” Helping a friend refine a screenplay led to him pitching
  and selling his own projects: “Within six months I went from someone who
  basically didn’t know how I was going to keep the lights on until the end of
  the year to this whole other career.” He has continued to write novels in
  parallel with his showrunner career – his sixth, Anthem, was published in 2022
  – and made his feature directorial debut in 2019 with the astronaut
  psychodrama Lucy in the Sky, starring Natalie Portman. If this magpie approach
  suggests a certain creative restlessness – he also provided vocals for
  Legion’s spacey soundtrack of retro covers – it has also been a conscious
  attempt at diversifying. “It’s given me a lot of options, which as an artist
  translates into a modicum of control over your own destiny,” he says. One
  unexpected early influence is British comedy. After studying theatre in
  London, his father returned with Goon Show LPs that Hawley and his brother
  could soon recite by heart. “I just wore those records out,” he remembers. He
  also devoured NPR repeats of the BBC’s 1978 radio sitcom The Hitchhiker’s
  Guide to the Galaxy, and enthuses about seeing The Young Ones at an
  impressionable age. That meant the casting of Adrian Edmondson as a sinister
  aide-de-camp in Alien: Earth was a real full-circle moment. “I told Adrian
  that there was a moment on The Young Ones [in the episode Flood] that informs
  everything you need to know about me as a storyteller,” he says. “It was when
  his character, Vyvyan, walked into the closet and ended up in Narnia. I must
  have been in my teens when I saw it and it was such a mind-blowing thing, that
  you could have magical realism in a comedy about roommates.” What was it like
  meeting his childhood hero? “I’ve found with a lot of comedic actors that
  their downtime persona is very different. Adrian is very measured, you know.”
  Hawley laughs. “He’s much more like his character in our show than Vyvyan.” •
  Alien: Earth launches 13 August on Disney+ in the UK. • This article was
  amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version said the BBC radio sitcom The
  Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was an adaptation of the novels; however, the
  radio show preceded the books.
