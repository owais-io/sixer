  Hamas officials say they have accepted a proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal
  that would include the release of half of the remaining 20 living hostages as
  part of a phased resolution to the war, as Gaza health officials said 62,000
  Palestinians had now died in the 22 months of war. The UK government is
  working “at pace” to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to Britain for
  urgent medical treatment, Downing Street has said. Prime minister Keir
  Starmer’s official spokesperson said a cross-government task force is “up and
  running”, but warned that it is a “sensitive and complex process”. Benjamin
  Netanyahu has criticised massive street protests against his handling of the
  Gaza war, and failure to secure the release of remaining Israeli hostages,
  suggesting demonstrators were giving comfort to Hamas’s position in
  negotiations. The Israeli prime minister made his comments against the
  backdrop of the largest protests in almost two years of war, with estimates
  that upwards of 400,000 joined marches across Israel on Sunday. The latest
  Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Palestinian group Hamas includes a
  suspension of military operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to
  reach a comprehensive deal to end nearly two-year-long Gaza war, an Egyptian
  official source told Reuters on Monday. The period of suspension would see the
  exchange of Palestinian prisoners in return for release of half of the Israeli
  hostages held in Gaza, the source said. Egypt said on Monday it was willing to
  join a potential international force deployed to war-torn Gaza, but only if
  backed by a UN security council resolution and accompanied by a “political
  horizon”, as ceasefire efforts pressed on in Cairo, AFP reports. The Hostages
  and Missing Families Forum has called for another nationwide strike on Sunday,
  urging the Israeli government to end the war in exchange for the release of
  hostages, following a similar protest held yesterday. The Times of Israel
  reported that the forum said yesterday’s protests “prove in a clear manner and
  a strong voice what most of the country wants: the nation of Israel supports
  the return of hostages and the end of the war!” Amnesty International on
  Monday accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza,
  citing testimonies of displaced Palestinians and medical staff treating
  malnourished children in the territory. Israel, while heavily restricting aid
  allowed into the Gaza Strip, has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate
  starvation in the 22-month-old war. Contacted by AFP, the military and foreign
  ministry did not immediately comment on Amnesty’s findings, AFP reports. The
  Palestinian Health Ministry reports that more than 62,000 Palestinians have
  been killed in the 22-month Gaza war, including 1,965 people killed while
  seeking aid or near aid distribution sites, the Associated Press reports.
  Ahmed Mheisen, a Palestinian shelter manager in Beit Lahiya, a war-devastated
  suburb abutting eastern Gaza City, said 995 families had departed the area in
  recent days for the south, Reuters reports. With the Israeli offensive
  looming, Mheisen put the number of tents needed for emergency shelter at 1.5
  million, saying Israel had allowed only 120,000 tents into the territory
  during a January-March ceasefire. UK prime minister Keir Starmer has been
  urged to recall Parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a
  joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On
  an official trip to Egypt, Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa has
  been visiting the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza,
  alongside Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty. The pair visited aid
  warehouses in Al-Arish and a field hospital. Israel on Monday announced it
  will provide emergency humanitarian aid to South Sudan, one of the world’s
  poorest countries in the midst of renewed violent political instability, AFP
  reports. The announcement by foreign minister Gideon Saar comes after media
  reports that Israel held talks with the African state to resettle Palestinians
  from Gaza – a claim South Sudan has firmly rejected. Norway’s sovereign wealth
  fund, the world’s largest, said on Monday it had decided to exclude six
  companies with connections to the West Bank and Gaza from its portfolio,
  following a review of its Israeli investments. The $2tn wealth fund did not
  name the companies it had decided to exclude, but said these would be made
  public once the divestment was completed, Reuters reports. US envoy Tom
  Barrack called on Israel to honour its commitments under a ceasefire that
  ended its war with Hezbollah, after the Lebanese government launched a process
  to disarm the militant group. Under the truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon
  were to be restricted to the state and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops
  from the country, although it has kept forces in five border points it deems
  strategic. “I think the Lebanese government has done their part. They’ve taken
  the first step. Now what we need is Israel to comply with that equal
  handshake,” Barrack said following a meeting in Beirut with Lebanese President
  Joseph Aoun. Egypt and Qatar have submitted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal to
  Israel, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service said Monday, and said
  that “the ball is now in its court”, according to AFP. Speaking to Egyptian
  state-linked media Al-Qahera News, which is close to Egypt’s intelligence
  services, Diaa Rashwan said mediators Egypt and Qatar had prepared the new
  proposal based on a recent US plan. Israel’s national security minister Itamar
  Ben Gvir has said on X that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu “has no mandate
  for a partial deal.” Ben Gvir previously left the government the last time a
  ceasefire agreement was reached and has warned he may do so again if another
  deal with Hamas is signed. Smoke billows following an Israeli strike on a
  house in Khan Yunis, earlier today. The latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed
  by Palestinian group Hamas includes a suspension of military operations for 60
  days and could be seen as a path to reach a comprehensive deal to end nearly
  two-year-long Gaza war, an Egyptian official source told Reuters on Monday.

  return for release of half of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the source
  said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for another

  yesterday. The Times of Israel reported that the forum said yesterday’s
  protests “prove in a clear manner and a strong voice what most of the country
  wants: the nation of Israel supports the return of hostages and the end of the
  war!” Hamas has informed mediators that it approves the latest Gaza ceasefire
  proposal, a group official told Reuters on Monday. The official did not
  provide further details. Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised massive street
  protests against his handling of the Gaza war, and failure to secure the
  release of remaining Israeli hostages, suggesting demonstrators were giving
  comfort to Hamas’s position in negotiations. The Israeli prime minister made
  his comments against the backdrop of the largest protests in almost two years
  of war, with estimates that upwards of 400,000 joined marches across Israel on
  Sunday. “The people who are calling today for the war’s end without Hamas’s
  defeat are not only toughening Hamas’s stance and distancing our hostages’
  release, they are also ensuring that the atrocities of October 7 will recur
  time and again, and that our sons and daughters will have to fight time and
  again in an endless war. “Therefore, in order to advance our hostages’ release
  and to ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel, we have to finish
  the job and defeat Hamas,” said Netanyahu in a statement. The Palestinian
  health ministry said on Monday that more than 62,000 Palestinians had been
  killed in the 22-month war in Gaza. At least 60 people were killed in the past
  24 hours, bringing the death toll from the Israel-Hamas war that started on 7
  October 2023 to 62,004. Another 156,230 had been wounded, the ministry said.
  While the day of protest was called by supporters of Israeli hostage families,
  the scale of the demonstrations suggests increasingly sharp divisions in
  Israeli society over a conflict that has yet to deliver the return of hostages
  at a mounting economic, diplomatic and social cost for the country. The UK
  government is working “at pace” to bring sick and injured children from Gaza
  to Britain for urgent medical treatment, Downing Street has said. Prime
  minister Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said a cross-government task
  force is “up and running”, but warned that it is a “sensitive and complex
  process”. His comments come after the BBC reported that the first group of
  critically ill and injured Gazan children, said to be between 30 and 50
  patients, will be arriving “in the coming weeks”. It is understood that the
  children will come from hospital with family members via a third country,
  where biometric data will be collected, and that some may enter the asylum
  system after completing treatment, PA reported. The Number 10 spokesperson
  said: “We’re not going to get into a running commentary on numbers or the
  exact process. “Exact numbers are going to depend on clinical need and various
  factors.” He added: “We continue to take all those plans to evacuate more
  children from Gaza, who require urgent medical care in the UK and specialist
  treatment. “Obviously, it’s sensitive and it’s a complex process, and the
  wellbeing of patients and their families is our top priority. “There’s a
  cross-government task force working together to deliver this new scheme and
  we’ll obviously provide an update as and when we’ve got them.” More than
  50,000 children are estimated to have been killed or injured in Gaza since
  October 2023, according to Unicef. A small number of children have so far been
  brought to the UK for specialist medical care via an initiative by Project
  Pure Hope, and they are being treated privately. Hamas negotiators in Cairo
  have received a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling for a 60-day
  truce and hostage release in two batches, a Palestinian official said on
  Monday. “The proposal is a framework agreement to launch negotiations on a
  permanent ceasefire,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding
  that “Hamas will hold internal consultations among its leadership” and with
  leaders of other Palestinian factions to review the proposal. Egypt said on
  Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to
  war-torn Gaza, but only if backed by a UN security council resolution and
  accompanied by a “political horizon”, as ceasefire efforts pressed on in
  Cairo, AFP reports. Amnesty International on Monday accused Israel of enacting
  a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza, citing testimonies of displaced

  are some images coming to us over the wires. Israel on Monday announced it
  will provide emergency humanitarian aid to South Sudan, in the midst of
  renewed violent political instability, AFP reports. The announcement by
  foreign minister Gideon Saar comes after media reports that Israel held talks
  with the African state to resettle Palestinians from Gaza – a claim South
  Sudan has firmly rejected. The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, now in
  its 23rd month, has created a dire humanitarian crisis for the Palestinian
  territory’s population of more than two million people. “In light of the
  severe humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, (Israel) will deliver urgent
  humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in the country,” a statement
  from Saar’s office said. “South Sudan is currently struggling with a cholera
  outbreak and facing a severe shortage of resources,” the statement added. “The
  aid will include essential medical supplies for treating patients, water
  purification equipment, gloves and face masks, as well as special hygiene kits
  to prevent cholera, and food packages,” the statement added. Israel’s deputy
  foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, paid an official visit to the country’s
  capital, Juba, last week. Meanwhile, UN-backed experts have warned of
  widespread famine unfolding in Gaza, where Israel has drastically curtailed
  the amount of humanitarian aid it allows in, and convoys have been repeatedly
  looted. The Palestinian Health Ministry reports that more than 62,000
  Palestinians have been killed in the 22-month Gaza war, including 1,965 people
  killed while seeking aid or near aid distribution sites, the Associated Press
  reports. On Monday, they stated that at least 60 people died in the past 24
  hours, bringing the death toll from the Israel-Hamas conflict, which began on
  7 October 2023, to 62,004. Another 156,230 have been wounded. Over the past 24
  hours, Gaza Strip hospitals recorded five deaths, including two children, due
  to famine and malnutrition, bringing the total number of deaths to 263,
  including 112 children, the ministry said. The United Nations and other
  experts consider the ministry’s figures reliable, though Israel disputes them
  and hasn’t provided its own casualty count. Ahmed Mheisen, a Palestinian
  shelter manager in Beit Lahiya, a war-devastated suburb abutting eastern Gaza
  City, said 995 families had departed the area in recent days for the south,
  Reuters reports. With the Israeli offensive looming, Mheisen put the number of
  tents needed for emergency shelter at 1.5 million, saying Israel had allowed
  only 120,000 tents into the territory during a January-March ceasefire. The UN
  humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in
  need of emergency shelter items in Gaza. Here are some images coming to us
  over the wires. Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential
  international force deployed to war-torn Gaza, but only if backed by a UN
  security council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”, as
  ceasefire efforts pressed on in Cairo, AFP reports. “We are standing ready of
  course to help, to contribute to any international force to be deployed in
  Gaza in some specific parameters,” Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty
  told a joint press conference with Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa
  at the Rafah border crossing on Monday. “First of all, to have a security
  council resolution, to have a clear-cut mandate, and of course to come within
  a political horizon,” Abdelatty said. “Without a political horizon, it will be
  nonsense to deploy any forces there.” Abdelatty said a political framework
  would enable international troops to operate more effectively and support
  Palestinians “to realise their own independent Palestinian state in their
  homeland”. The Palestinian premier, Mustafa, said a temporary committee would
  manage the territory after the war ended, with full authority resting with the
  Palestinian government. “We’re not creating a new political entity in Gaza.
  Rather, we are reactivating the institutions in the State of Palestine and its
  government in Gaza,” he said. Israel’s foreign minister has revoked the visas
  of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, citing Australia’s
  “unjustified refusal” to grant visas to Israeli figures and its intention to
  recognise Palestinian statehood. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar
  said the decision was made following the Albanese government’s cancellation of
  Simcha Rothman’s visa on Monday ahead of his speaking tour this month. “While
  antisemitism is raging in Australia, including manifestations of violence
  against Jews and Jewish institutions, the Australian government is choosing to
  fuel it by false accusations, as if the visit of Israeli figures will disrupt
  public order and harm Australia’s Muslim population,” Sa’r said. “It is
  shameful and unacceptable!” Reports that some Palestinians are leaving eastern
  areas of Gaza City come amid warnings that the move by the Israeli military to
  prepare for the forcible displacement of 1 million people from the area will
  lead to a deepening of the humanitarian disaster in the region. Malak A
  Tantesh in Gaza and Lorenzo Tondo in Jerusalem spoke to some of those
  affected. We are already destroyed and exhausted, physically and
  psychologically, from repeated displacement, from the lack of food and water,”
  Akram Shlabia, 85, told the Guardian from the Shuja’iyya neighbourhood of Gaza
  City. “And now they want us to go to the south. Into nothingness, into the
  unknown, into a place without shelter or the basic means of life, even
  safety.” “We will face many problems in displacement,” said Mazen Hasaneh, 40,
  from al-Tuffah neighbourhood, who has been displaced six times during the war.
  “First, securing a way to transport the necessary items like a tent and other
  basics, and of course many drivers will exploit people’s desperation and raise
  prices, while people have no money to pay. “The second problem is finding a
  place to set up the tent and settle, along with the difficulty of finding and
  providing water and food. Everything about displacement is suffering,
  especially in our current conditions.” “If the plan is carried out, I will
  look for a safe place for myself and my children within Gaza, and I will not
  consider moving to the south of the Strip,” said Asma Al-Barawi, 34, from
  al-Tuffah, the mother of seven children. “I didn’t leave the first time, and I
  won’t leave this time. The experiences and suffering I heard from the
  displaced who went south were harsh and unbearable.” “I lost everything
  because of this war,” she added. “I lost two of my brothers, two of my
  maternal aunts with their families, my cousin, and my father-in-law. And, I
  lost my new home, which I only left with some clothes.” Some Palestinians,
  fearing an Israeli onslaught could come soon, are leaving eastern areas of
  Gaza City for points to the west, while others are exploring evacuating
  further south, Reuters reports. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
  described Gaza City as Hamas’ last bastion. But, with Israel already holding
  75% of Gaza, the military has warned that expanding the offensive could
  endanger hostages still alive and draw troops into protracted and deadly
  guerrilla warfare. In Gaza City, many Palestinians have also been calling for
  protests soon to demand an end to a war that has demolished much of the
  territory and wrought a humanitarian disaster, and for Hamas to intensify
  talks to avert the Israeli ground offensive. An Israeli armoured incursion
  into Gaza City could see the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people,
  many of whom have been uprooted multiple times earlier in the war. “The people
  of Gaza City are like someone who received a death sentence and is awaiting
  execution,” said Tamer Burai, a Gaza City businessman. “I am moving my parents
  and my family to the south today or tomorrow. I can’t risk losing any of them
  should there be a surprising invasion,” he told Reuters via a chat app. Gaza’s
  civil defence agency said Israeli strikes and gunfire across the territory
  killed at least 11 people on Monday, AFP reports The Israeli military has been
  contacted for comment. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest,
  said on Monday it had decided to exclude six companies with connections to the
  West Bank and Gaza from its portfolio, following a review of its Israeli
  investments. The $2tn wealth fund did not name the companies it had decided to
  exclude, but said these would be made public once the divestment was
  completed, Reuters reports. The announcement follows an urgent review launched
  this month after reports that the fund had built a stake in an Israeli jet
  engine group that provides services to Israel’s armed forces, including the
  maintenance of fighter jets. The fund’s ethics council watchdog said it would
  continue to assess Israeli companies every quarter. Egyptian foreign minister
  Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said
  that “as we speak now, there are Palestinian and Qatari delegations present on
  Egyptian soil working to intensify efforts to put an end to the systematic
  killing and starvation”, AFP reports. Last week, Abdelatty said that Cairo was
  working with Qatar and the United States to broker a 60-day truce “with the
  release of some hostages and some Palestinian detainees and the flow of
  humanitarian and medical assistance to Gaza without restrictions”. More than
  two weeks of negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha ended last month with no
  breakthrough. UK prime minister Keir Starmer has been urged to recall
  parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed
  by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, PA Media reports. The
  letter urges the prime minister to “act now” to exert pressure on Israel to
  end the war in Gaza. It has been signed by Northern Ireland’s first minister
  Michelle O’Neill, Alliance party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Claire Hanna,
  the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and the convener of the party’s
  Holyrood group Stuart McMillan. Other co-signatories include co-leader Lorna
  Slater of Scottish Greens, Alistair Carmichael from the Scottish Liberal
  Democrats, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth and Plaid Cymru’s Westminster
  group leader Liz Saville Roberts. The letter says: “The humanitarian
  catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is both man-made and avoidable. “It is
  characterised not only by relentless bombardment and destruction, but by the
  deliberate creation of conditions that are starving a civilian population.
  “The blocking of food, water, and medical supplies has precipitated what UN
  agencies and humanitarian experts describe as a man-made famine; one that is
  rapidly claiming lives and inflicting irreparable harm on an already
  traumatised population.” It calls upon Starmer to recall Parliament, impose
  sanctions on Israel and “support a ceasefire and meaningful diplomatic
  intervention to protect civilians and secure a just, lasting peace”. It also
  calls for an immediate end to all arms sales to Israel, support for an
  “independent, international investigations into alleged war crimes, crimes
  against humanity, and acts of genocide in Gaza”. The letter also says the UK
  should use its “diplomatic influence to press for the unimpeded delivery of
  food, water, medicine, and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza”. It adds:
  “The UK’s moral standing and commitment to human rights will be measured by
  its response to this crisis. “We urge you to act decisively by standing
  against the man-made famine, the mass killing of children, and the broader
  assault on civilian life. “History will remember whether we chose to remain
  silent or to stand on the side of humanity.” Hamas negotiators in Cairo have
  received a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling for a 60-day truce
  and hostage release in two batches, a Palestinian official said on Monday.
  “The proposal is a framework agreement to launch negotiations on a permanent
  ceasefire,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that
  “Hamas will hold internal consultations among its leadership” and with leaders
  of other Palestinian factions to review the proposal. Hamas delegation in
  Egypt receives new Gaza truce plan, AFP reports. More to follow … The first
  time I met Al Jazeera’s Gaza team lead, Tamer Almisshal, was in July last
  year. His team had already buried two journalists, Hamza al-Dahdouh and Samer
  Abu Daqqa. The rest, he told me, were hungry. They were also dealing with
  trying to get hold of protective gear, threats from the Israel Defense Forces
  (IDF) and the killing of family members. Ismail al-Ghoul hadn’t seen his wife
  and child in months and was missing them intensely. Hossam Shabat, Mohammed
  Qraiqea and Anas al-Sharif were asking for time to secure food in the morning
  before they could start reporting. Today, they are all dead. I spoke with
  various members of the Gaza team while writing a profile of Gaza’s veteran
  reporter Wael al-Dahdouh, who lost his wife, three of his children and
  grandson. All spoke of their work as a duty that needed to be carried out
  despite the risks. Three members of that team have since been killed in a
  chain of assassinations. Each time I sent condolences, the response was always
  that the coverage would not cease. “We are continuing,” the Gaza editor told
  me last week, after he lost his entire Gaza City team in the targeted strike
  that claimed the lives of Sharif, Mohammed Nofal, Ibrahim Thaher and Qraiqea.

  Israel’s war on Gaza. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on
  Sunday evening to demand an end to the war in Gaza and the release of hostages
  – one of the largest demonstrations in Israel since the start of the fighting
  in October 2023. The evening rally was the culmination of a day of protest and
  a general strike to pressure the government to halt the military campaign.
  “Bring them all home! Stop the war!” shouted the vast crowd, which had
  converged on the so-called Hostage Square in Tel Aviv plaza – a focal point
  for protesters throughout the war. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, the
  initiator of the day of protest, estimated that about 500,000 people joined
  the demonstration in Tel Aviv – a figure not confirmed by the police. “We
  demand a comprehensive and achievable agreement and an end to the war,” said
  Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan and a leading figure of the protest
  movement. In other developments: Amnesty International on Monday accused
  Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza, citing
  testimonies of displaced Palestinians and medical staff treating malnourished
  children in the territory. Israel, while heavily restricting aid allowed into
  the Gaza Strip, has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate starvation in the
  22-month-old war. Contacted by AFP, the military and foreign ministry did not
  immediately comment on Amnesty’s findings. The Australian government cancelled
  the visa of a far-right Israeli politician on Monday ahead of a speaking tour,
  a move event organisers tagged “viciously antisemitic”. Simcha Rothman, whose

  coalition, had been scheduled to speak at events organised by the Australian
  Jewish Association.

Hamas officials say they have accepted a proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal that would include the release of half of the remaining 20 living hostages as part of a phased resolution to the war, as Gaza health officials said 62,000 Palestinians had now died in the 22 months of war. The UK government is working “at pace” to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to Britain for urgent medical treatment, Downing Street has said. Prime minister Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said a cross-government task force is “up and running”, but warned that it is a “sensitive and complex process”. Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised massive street protests against his handling of the Gaza war, and failure to secure the release of remaining Israeli hostages, suggesting demonstrators were giving comfort to Hamas’s position in negotiations. The Israeli prime minister made his comments against the backdrop of the largest protests in almost two years of war, with estimates that upwards of 400,000 joined marches across Israel on Sunday. The latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Palestinian group Hamas includes a suspension of military operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to reach a comprehensive deal to end nearly two-year-long Gaza war, an Egyptian official source told Reuters on Monday. The period of suspension would see the exchange of Palestinian prisoners in return for release of half of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the source said. Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to war-torn Gaza, but only if backed by a UN security council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”, as ceasefire efforts pressed on in Cairo, AFP reports. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for another nationwide strike on Sunday, urging the Israeli government to end the war in exchange for the release of hostages, following a similar protest held yesterday. The Times of Israel reported that the forum said yesterday’s protests “prove in a clear manner and a strong voice what most of the country wants: the nation of Israel supports the return of hostages and the end of the war!” Amnesty International on Monday accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza, citing testimonies of displaced Palestinians and medical staff treating malnourished children in the territory.

The Palestinian Health Ministry reports that more than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in the 22-month Gaza war, including 1,965 people killed while seeking aid or near aid distribution sites, the Associated Press reports. Ahmed Mheisen, a Palestinian shelter manager in Beit Lahiya, a war-devastated suburb abutting eastern Gaza City, said 995 families had departed the area in recent days for the south, Reuters reports. With the Israeli offensive looming, Mheisen put the number of tents needed for emergency shelter at 1.5 million, saying Israel had allowed only 120,000 tents into the territory during a January-March ceasefire. UK prime minister Keir Starmer has been urged to recall Parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On an official trip to Egypt, Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa has been visiting the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza, alongside Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty. The pair visited aid warehouses in Al-Arish and a field hospital. Israel on Monday announced it will provide emergency humanitarian aid to South Sudan, one of the world’s poorest countries in the midst of renewed violent political instability, AFP reports. The announcement by foreign minister Gideon Saar comes after media reports that Israel held talks with the African state to resettle Palestinians from Gaza – a claim South Sudan has firmly rejected. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, said on Monday it had decided to exclude six companies with connections to the West Bank and Gaza from its portfolio, following a review of its Israeli investments. The $2tn wealth fund did not name the companies it had decided to exclude, but said these would be made public once the divestment was completed, Reuters reports. US envoy Tom Barrack called on Israel to honour its commitments under a ceasefire that ended its war with Hezbollah, after the Lebanese government launched a process to disarm the militant group. Under the truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon were to be restricted to the state and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops from the country, although it has kept forces in five border points it deems strategic. “I think the Lebanese government has done their part. They’ve taken the first step. Now what we need is Israel to comply with that equal handshake,” Barrack said following a meeting in Beirut with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun. Egypt and Qatar have submitted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal to Israel, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service said Monday, and said that “the ball is now in its court”, according to AFP. Speaking to Egyptian state-linked media Al-Qahera News, which is close to Egypt’s intelligence services, Diaa Rashwan said mediators Egypt and Qatar had prepared the new proposal based on a recent US plan. Israel’s national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has said on X that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu “has no mandate for a partial deal.” Ben Gvir previously left the government the last time a ceasefire agreement was reached and has warned he may do so again if another deal with Hamas is signed. Smoke billows following an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Yunis, earlier today. The latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Palestinian group Hamas includes a suspension of military operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to reach a comprehensive deal to end nearly two-year-long Gaza war, an Egyptian official source told Reuters on Monday. The period of suspension would see the exchange of Palestinian prisoners in return for release of half of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the source said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for another nationwide strike on Sunday, urging the Israeli government to end the war in exchange for the release of hostages, following a similar protest held yesterday. The Times of Israel reported that the forum said yesterday’s protests “prove in a clear manner and a strong voice what most of the country wants: the nation of Israel supports the return of hostages and the end of the war!” Hamas has informed mediators that it approves the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal, a group official told Reuters on Monday. The official did not provide further details. Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised massive street protests against his handling of the Gaza war, and failure to secure the release of remaining Israeli hostages, suggesting demonstrators were giving comfort to Hamas’s position in negotiations. The Israeli prime minister made his comments against the backdrop of the largest protests in almost two years of war, with estimates that upwards of 400,000 joined marches across Israel on Sunday. “The people who are calling today for the war’s end without Hamas’s defeat are not only toughening Hamas’s stance and distancing our hostages’ release, they are also ensuring that the atrocities of October 7 will recur time and again, and that our sons and daughters will have to fight time and again in an endless war. “Therefore, in order to advance our hostages’ release and to ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel, we have to finish the job and defeat Hamas,” said Netanyahu in a statement. The Palestinian health ministry said on Monday that more than 62,000 Palestinians had been killed in the 22-month war in Gaza. At least 60 people were killed in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from the Israel-Hamas war that started on 7 October 2023 to 62,004. Another 156,230 had been wounded, the ministry said. While the day of protest was called by supporters of Israeli hostage families, the scale of the demonstrations suggests increasingly sharp divisions in Israeli society over a conflict that has yet to deliver the return of hostages at a mounting economic, diplomatic and social cost for the country. The UK government is working “at pace” to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to Britain for urgent medical treatment, Downing Street has said. Prime minister Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said a cross-government task force is “up and running”, but warned that it is a “sensitive and complex process”. His comments come after the BBC reported that the first group of critically ill and injured Gazan children, said to be between 30 and 50 patients, will be arriving “in the coming weeks”. It is understood that the children will come from hospital with family members via a third country, where biometric data will be collected, and that some may enter the asylum system after completing treatment, PA reported. The Number 10 spokesperson said: “We’re not going to get into a running commentary on numbers or the exact process. “Exact numbers are going to depend on clinical need and various factors.” He added: “We continue to take all those plans to evacuate more children from Gaza, who require urgent medical care in the UK and specialist treatment. “Obviously, it’s sensitive and it’s a complex process, and the wellbeing of patients and their families is our top priority. “There’s a cross-government task force working together to deliver this new scheme and we’ll obviously provide an update as and when we’ve got them.” More than 50,000 children are estimated to have been killed or injured in Gaza since October 2023, according to Unicef. A small number of children have so far been brought to the UK for specialist medical care via an initiative by Project Pure Hope, and they are being treated privately. Hamas negotiators in Cairo have received a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling for a 60-day truce and hostage release in two batches, a Palestinian official said on Monday. “The proposal is a framework agreement to launch negotiations on a permanent ceasefire,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that “Hamas will hold internal consultations among its leadership” and with leaders of other Palestinian factions to review the proposal. Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to war-torn Gaza, but only if backed by a UN security council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”, as ceasefire efforts pressed on in Cairo, AFP reports. Amnesty International on Monday accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza, citing testimonies of displaced Palestinians and medical staff treating malnourished children in the territory. Israel, while heavily restricting aid allowed into the Gaza Strip, has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate starvation in the 22-month-old war. Contacted by AFP, the military and foreign ministry did not immediately comment on Amnesty’s findings, AFP reports.

Israel on Monday announced it will provide emergency humanitarian aid to South Sudan, in the midst of renewed violent political instability, AFP reports. The announcement by foreign minister Gideon Saar comes after media reports that Israel held talks with the African state to resettle Palestinians from Gaza – a claim South Sudan has firmly rejected. The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, now in its 23rd month, has created a dire humanitarian crisis for the Palestinian territory’s population of more than two million people. “In light of the severe humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, (Israel) will deliver urgent humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in the country,” a statement from Saar’s office said. “South Sudan is currently struggling with a cholera outbreak and facing a severe shortage of resources,” the statement added. “The aid will include essential medical supplies for treating patients, water purification equipment, gloves and face masks, as well as special hygiene kits to prevent cholera, and food packages,” the statement added. Israel’s deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, paid an official visit to the country’s capital, Juba, last week. Meanwhile, UN-backed experts have warned of widespread famine unfolding in Gaza, where Israel has drastically curtailed the amount of humanitarian aid it allows in, and convoys have been repeatedly looted. The Palestinian Health Ministry reports that more than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in the 22-month Gaza war, including 1,965 people killed while seeking aid or near aid distribution sites, the Associated Press reports. On Monday, they stated that at least 60 people died in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from the Israel-Hamas conflict, which began on 7 October 2023, to 62,004. Another 156,230 have been wounded. Over the past 24 hours, Gaza Strip hospitals recorded five deaths, including two children, due to famine and malnutrition, bringing the total number of deaths to 263, including 112 children, the ministry said. The United Nations and other experts consider the ministry’s figures reliable, though Israel disputes them and hasn’t provided its own casualty count. Ahmed Mheisen, a Palestinian shelter manager in Beit Lahiya, a war-devastated suburb abutting eastern Gaza City, said 995 families had departed the area in recent days for the south, Reuters reports. With the Israeli offensive looming, Mheisen put the number of tents needed for emergency shelter at 1.5 million, saying Israel had allowed only 120,000 tents into the territory during a January-March ceasefire. The UN humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in need of emergency shelter items in Gaza. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to war-torn Gaza, but only if backed by a UN security council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”, as ceasefire efforts pressed on in Cairo, AFP reports. “We are standing ready of course to help, to contribute to any international force to be deployed in Gaza in some specific parameters,” Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty told a joint press conference with Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa at the Rafah border crossing on Monday. “First of all, to have a security council resolution, to have a clear-cut mandate, and of course to come within a political horizon,” Abdelatty said. “Without a political horizon, it will be nonsense to deploy any forces there.” Abdelatty said a political framework would enable international troops to operate more effectively and support Palestinians “to realise their own independent Palestinian state in their homeland”. The Palestinian premier, Mustafa, said a temporary committee would manage the territory after the war ended, with full authority resting with the Palestinian government. “We’re not creating a new political entity in Gaza. Rather, we are reactivating the institutions in the State of Palestine and its government in Gaza,” he said. Israel’s foreign minister has revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, citing Australia’s “unjustified refusal” to grant visas to Israeli figures and its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar said the decision was made following the Albanese government’s cancellation of Simcha Rothman’s visa on Monday ahead of his speaking tour this month. “While antisemitism is raging in Australia, including manifestations of violence against Jews and Jewish institutions, the Australian government is choosing to fuel it by false accusations, as if the visit of Israeli figures will disrupt public order and harm Australia’s Muslim population,” Sa’r said. “It is shameful and unacceptable!” Reports that some Palestinians are leaving eastern areas of Gaza City come amid warnings that the move by the Israeli military to prepare for the forcible displacement of 1 million people from the area will lead to a deepening of the humanitarian disaster in the region. Malak A Tantesh in Gaza and Lorenzo Tondo in Jerusalem spoke to some of those affected. We are already destroyed and exhausted, physically and psychologically, from repeated displacement, from the lack of food and water,” Akram Shlabia, 85, told the Guardian from the Shuja’iyya neighbourhood of Gaza City. “And now they want us to go to the south. Into nothingness, into the unknown, into a place without shelter or the basic means of life, even safety.” “We will face many problems in displacement,” said Mazen Hasaneh, 40, from al-Tuffah neighbourhood, who has been displaced six times during the war. “First, securing a way to transport the necessary items like a tent and other basics, and of course many drivers will exploit people’s desperation and raise prices, while people have no money to pay. “The second problem is finding a place to set up the tent and settle, along with the difficulty of finding and providing water and food. Everything about displacement is suffering, especially in our current conditions.” “If the plan is carried out, I will look for a safe place for myself and my children within Gaza, and I will not consider moving to the south of the Strip,” said Asma Al-Barawi, 34, from al-Tuffah, the mother of seven children. “I didn’t leave the first time, and I won’t leave this time. The experiences and suffering I heard from the displaced who went south were harsh and unbearable.” “I lost everything because of this war,” she added. “I lost two of my brothers, two of my maternal aunts with their families, my cousin, and my father-in-law. And, I lost my new home, which I only left with some clothes.” Some Palestinians, fearing an Israeli onslaught could come soon, are leaving eastern areas of Gaza City for points to the west, while others are exploring evacuating further south, Reuters reports. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described Gaza City as Hamas’ last bastion. But, with Israel already holding 75% of Gaza, the military has warned that expanding the offensive could endanger hostages still alive and draw troops into protracted and deadly guerrilla warfare. In Gaza City, many Palestinians have also been calling for protests soon to demand an end to a war that has demolished much of the territory and wrought a humanitarian disaster, and for Hamas to intensify talks to avert the Israeli ground offensive. An Israeli armoured incursion into Gaza City could see the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times earlier in the war. “The people of Gaza City are like someone who received a death sentence and is awaiting execution,” said Tamer Burai, a Gaza City businessman. “I am moving my parents and my family to the south today or tomorrow. I can’t risk losing any of them should there be a surprising invasion,” he told Reuters via a chat app. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes and gunfire across the territory killed at least 11 people on Monday, AFP reports The Israeli military has been contacted for comment. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, said on Monday it had decided to exclude six companies with connections to the West Bank and Gaza from its portfolio, following a review of its Israeli investments. The $2tn wealth fund did not name the companies it had decided to exclude, but said these would be made public once the divestment was completed, Reuters reports. The announcement follows an urgent review launched this month after reports that the fund had built a stake in an Israeli jet engine group that provides services to Israel’s armed forces, including the maintenance of fighter jets. The fund’s ethics council watchdog said it would continue to assess Israeli companies every quarter. Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said that “as we speak now, there are Palestinian and Qatari delegations present on Egyptian soil working to intensify efforts to put an end to the systematic killing and starvation”, AFP reports. Last week, Abdelatty said that Cairo was working with Qatar and the United States to broker a 60-day truce “with the release of some hostages and some Palestinian detainees and the flow of humanitarian and medical assistance to Gaza without restrictions”. More than two weeks of negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha ended last month with no breakthrough. UK prime minister Keir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, PA Media reports. The letter urges the prime minister to “act now” to exert pressure on Israel to end the war in Gaza. It has been signed by Northern Ireland’s first minister Michelle O’Neill, Alliance party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Claire Hanna, the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and the convener of the party’s Holyrood group Stuart McMillan. Other co-signatories include co-leader Lorna Slater of Scottish Greens, Alistair Carmichael from the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth and Plaid Cymru’s Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts. The letter says: “The humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is both man-made and avoidable. “It is characterised not only by relentless bombardment and destruction, but by the deliberate creation of conditions that are starving a civilian population. “The blocking of food, water, and medical supplies has precipitated what UN agencies and humanitarian experts describe as a man-made famine; one that is rapidly claiming lives and inflicting irreparable harm on an already traumatised population.” It calls upon Starmer to recall Parliament, impose sanctions on Israel and “support a ceasefire and meaningful diplomatic intervention to protect civilians and secure a just, lasting peace”. It also calls for an immediate end to all arms sales to Israel, support for an “independent, international investigations into alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, and acts of genocide in Gaza”. The letter also says the UK should use its “diplomatic influence to press for the unimpeded delivery of food, water, medicine, and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza”. It adds: “The UK’s moral standing and commitment to human rights will be measured by its response to this crisis. “We urge you to act decisively by standing against the man-made famine, the mass killing of children, and the broader assault on civilian life. “History will remember whether we chose to remain silent or to stand on the side of humanity.” Hamas negotiators in Cairo have received a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling for a 60-day truce and hostage release in two batches, a Palestinian official said on Monday. “The proposal is a framework agreement to launch negotiations on a permanent ceasefire,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that “Hamas will hold internal consultations among its leadership” and with leaders of other Palestinian factions to review the proposal. Hamas delegation in Egypt receives new Gaza truce plan, AFP reports. More to follow … The first time I met Al Jazeera’s Gaza team lead, Tamer Almisshal, was in July last year. His team had already buried two journalists, Hamza al-Dahdouh and Samer Abu Daqqa. The rest, he told me, were hungry. They were also dealing with trying to get hold of protective gear, threats from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the killing of family members. Ismail al-Ghoul hadn’t seen his wife and child in months and was missing them intensely. Hossam Shabat, Mohammed Qraiqea and Anas al-Sharif were asking for time to secure food in the morning before they could start reporting. Today, they are all dead. I spoke with various members of the Gaza team while writing a profile of Gaza’s veteran reporter Wael al-Dahdouh, who lost his wife, three of his children and grandson. All spoke of their work as a duty that needed to be carried out despite the risks. Three members of that team have since been killed in a chain of assassinations. Each time I sent condolences, the response was always that the coverage would not cease. “We are continuing,” the Gaza editor told me last week, after he lost his entire Gaza City team in the targeted strike that claimed the lives of Sharif, Mohammed Nofal, Ibrahim Thaher and Qraiqea. “We will not betray their message, or their last wishes.” Read the full piece here: Iran will continue talks with the IAEA - the UN nuclear watchdog - and the two sides will probably have another round of negotiations in the coming days, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, according to Reuters.

US envoy Tom Barrack called on Israel to honour its commitments under a ceasefire that ended its war with Hezbollah, after the Lebanese government launched a process to disarm the militant group. Under the truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon were to be restricted to the state, and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops from the country, although it has kept forces in five border points it deems strategic. “I think the Lebanese government has done their part.

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Sunday evening to demand an end to the war in Gaza and the release of hostages – one of the largest demonstrations in Israel since the start of the fighting in October 2023. The evening rally was the culmination of a day of protest and a general strike to pressure the government to halt the military campaign. “Bring them all home! Stop the war!” shouted the vast crowd, which had converged on the so-called Hostage Square in Tel Aviv plaza – a focal point for protesters throughout the war. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, the initiator of the day of protest, estimated that about 500,000 people joined the demonstration in Tel Aviv – a figure not confirmed by the police. “We demand a comprehensive and achievable agreement and an end to the war,” said Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan and a leading figure of the protest movement. In other developments: Amnesty International on Monday accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza, citing testimonies of displaced Palestinians and medical staff treating malnourished children in the territory. Israel, while heavily restricting aid allowed into the Gaza Strip, has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate starvation in the 22-month-old war. Contacted by AFP, the military and foreign ministry did not immediately comment on Amnesty’s findings. The Australian government cancelled the visa of a far-right Israeli politician on Monday ahead of a speaking tour, a move event organisers tagged “viciously antisemitic”. Simcha Rothman, whose party is part of Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition, had been scheduled to speak at events organised by the Australian Jewish Association.
