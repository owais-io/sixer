  John Textor has registered his interest in Sheffield Wednesday with the owner,
  Dejphon Chansiri, and is poised for talks over a potential takeover of the
  troubled Championship club, the Guardian understands. The American businessman
  is understood to have sounded out Chansiri’s representatives in recent days
  and wants to schedule a meeting with him for next week after flying to the UK.
  The asking price for Wednesday is thought to be about £100m, although it
  remains to be seen whether Textor would be prepared to offer that much.
  Chansiri has held talks with several potential buyers this summer and said in
  June he had rejected £40m from an unknown American consortium, which is not
  connected to Textor. Textor sold his 44.9% stake in Crystal Palace to Woody
  Johnson last month and is keen to reinvest in an English club as quickly as
  possible. He is said to view Wednesday, who failed to pay wages to players and
  staff on time in March, May and June, as an opportunity to revive a historic
  club similar to the challenge he took on at Botafogo in 2022. Botafogo were
  languishing in the second tier but were crowned South American champions last
  year after winning the Brazilian title in 2024. It is understood Textor
  consulted the football financier Keith Harris regarding Wednesday but has
  decided not to involve the former investment banker, who has brokered
  takeovers at West Ham, Manchester City and Aston Villa. Many Wednesday
  supporters boycotted Tuesday night’s home game against Leeds in the Carabao
  Cup in protest against Chansiri, who took over in 2015 from Milan Mandaric.
  The EFL said this month it was deeply concerned about the club’s financial
  situation. The manager Danny Röhl and several key players departed this summer
  and Wednesday began the season with only 15 first-team players after having a
  transfer embargo lifted, although signings still have to be approved by the
  league. There are also issues with Hillsborough, with the local council having
  deemed the North Stand not safe for spectators in July before that prohibition
  notice was lifted days before the first home game of the campaign against
  Stoke. It is understood that Textor – who has also been working with the Swiss
  bank UBS on an initial public offering (IPO) for his football investment firm,
  Eagle Football Holdings – would focus initially on investing in the squad if
  he succeeded Chansiri.
