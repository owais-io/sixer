  Here is the first instalment of the stimulating Oslo movie trilogy about
  modern relationships from Norwegian novelist and film-maker Dag Johan
  Haugerud: this one is Sex, followed by Love and Dreams. It is marginally my
  least favourite of the three, being slightly more didactic and less humorous
  than its companions – but still very lively and full of ideas. Two guys work
  for a chimney sweeping business, and unlike Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins,
  there’s no smudge-faced larking about with brushes. But the job still appears
  to involve a certain amount of perching on rooftops; perhaps Haugerud has
  chosen this so that he can get plenty of reflective high-up views of the city,
  rooted in dramatic reality, and which aren’t just hackneyed drone shots. They
  are close friends, and in an idle moment of chat, one of them (Jan Gunnar
  Røise) confesses to the other (Thorbjørn Harr) that recently, out of sheer
  curiosity, he had sex with another man. He does not consider himself gay but
  the experience was pleasurable. His fellow sweep, a committed Christian and
  heterosexual family man, has also had a self-questioning experience: a
  recurring dream in which a beautiful being, like David Bowie, responds to the
  female side of him. The problem now for Røise’s character is that, because he
  is so convinced that his adventure means nothing to his marriage, he recounts
  it at once to his wife; in his view, it isn’t even a confession, though his
  wife (Siri Forberg) is deeply upset. (Oddly, it is his male friend, and not
  his wife, who asks if they used a condom.) As for Harr’s character, he tells
  his wife about his dream and her take is that this gender-questioning
  experience is spiritual, because God and love go beyond gender. Finally, this
  man is to take part in a drama-dance theatre show about Christianity wearing a
  slightly ridiculous red outfit that his son has run up for him on a sewing
  machine, which shows that he is not neglecting the non-traditional side of
  masculinity. There is an interesting final conversation between the two men in
  which Røise insists that sex with a man does not make him gay; Harr smiles
  indulgently but is clearly sceptical. But then Røise says how moving it is
  that he can tell Harr about his sex-with-a-man experience, just as Harr can
  confide to him about being a Christian. Another type of movie would have
  reached for a comic effect here, with Harr perhaps nettled that his Christian
  beliefs are being considered equivalent to gay sex. This is, however, not what
  Haugerud intends: Sex is earnest, but cerebral and challenging. • Oslo Stories
  Trilogy: Sex is in UK cinemas from 22 August.
