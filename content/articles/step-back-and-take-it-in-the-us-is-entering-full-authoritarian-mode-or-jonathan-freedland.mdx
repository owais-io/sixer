  If this were happening somewhere else – in Latin America, say – how might it
  be reported? Having secured his grip on the capital, the president is now set
  to send troops to several rebel-held cities, claiming he is wanted there to
  restore order. The move follows raids on the homes of leading dissidents and
  comes as armed men seen as loyal to the president, many of them masked,
  continue to pluck people off the streets … Except this is happening in the
  United States of America and so we don’t quite talk about it that way. That’s
  not the only reason. It’s also because Donald Trump’s march towards
  authoritarianism is so steady, taking another step or two every day, that it’s
  easy to become inured to it: you can’t be in a state of shock permanently.
  And, besides, sober-minded people are wary of sounding hyperbolic or
  hysterical: their instinct is to play down rather than scream at the top of
  their voice. There’s something else, too. Trump’s dictator-like behaviour is
  so brazen, so blatant, that paradoxically, we discount it. It’s like being
  woken in the night by a burglar wearing a striped shirt and carrying a bag
  marked “Swag”: we would assume it was a joke or a stunt or otherwise unreal,
  rather than a genuine danger. So it is with Trump. We cannot quite believe
  what we are seeing. But here is what we are seeing. Trump has deployed the
  national guard on the streets of Washington DC, so that there are now 2,000
  troops, heavily armed, patrolling the capital. The pretext is fighting crime,
  but violent crime in DC was at a 30-year low when he made his move. The
  president has warned that Chicago will be next, perhaps Baltimore too. In June
  he sent the national guard and the marines into Los Angeles to put down
  protests against his immigration policies, protests which the administration
  said amounted to an “insurrection”. Demonstrators were complaining about the
  masked men of Ice, the immigration agency that, thanks to Trump, now has a
  budget to match that of the world’s largest armies, snatching people from
  street corners or hauling them from their cars. Those cities are all run by
  Democrats and, not coincidentally, have large Black populations. They are
  potential centres of opposition to Trump’s rule and he wants them under his
  control. The constitution’s insistence that states have powers of their own
  and that the reach of the federal government should be limited – a principle
  that until recently was sacred to Republicans – can go hang. Control is the
  goal, amassing power in the hands of the president and removing or neutering
  any institution or person that could stand in his way. That is the guiding
  logic that explains Trump’s every action, large and small, including his wars
  on the media, the courts, the universities and the civil servants of the
  federal government. It helps explain why FBI agents last week mounted a 7am
  raid on the home and office of John Bolton, once Trump’s national security
  adviser and now one of his most vocal critics. And why the president hinted
  darkly that the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie is in his sights.
  It’s why he has broken all convention, and possibly US law, by attempting to
  remove Lisa Cook as a member of the board of the Federal Reserve on unproven
  charges of mortgage fraud. Those charges are based on information helpfully
  supplied by the Trump loyalist installed as federal housing director and who,
  according to the New York Times, has repeatedly leveraged “the powers of his
  office … to investigate or attack Mr Trump’s most recognisable political
  enemies”. The pattern is clear: Trump is using the institutions of government
  to hound his foes in a manner that recalls the worst of Richard Nixon – though
  where Nixon skulked in the shadows, Trump’s abuses are in plain sight. And all
  in the pursuit of ever more power. Take the firing of Cook. With falling poll
  numbers, especially on his handling of the economy, he craves the sugar rush
  of an interest rate cut. The independent central bank won’t give it to him, so
  he wants to push the Fed out of the way and grab the power to set interest
  rates himself. Note the justification offered by JD Vance this week, that
  Trump is “much better able to make those determinations” than “unelected
  bureaucrats” because he embodies the will of the people. The reasoning is pure
  authoritarianism, arguing that a core principle of the US constitution, the
  separation of powers, should be swept aside, because all legitimate authority
  resides in one man alone. Of course, the greatest check on Trump would come
  from the opposition winning power in a democratic election, specifically
  Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives in November 2026.
  Trump is working hard to make that impossible: witness this month’s unabashed
  gerrymander in Texas, where at Trump’s command, Republicans redrew
  congressional boundaries to give themselves five more safe seats in the House.
  Trump wants more states to follow Texas’s lead, because a
  Democratic-controlled House would have powers of scrutiny that he rightly
  fears. Meanwhile, apparently prompted by his meeting with Vladimir Putin, he
  is once again at war against postal voting, baselessly decrying it as
  fraudulent, while also demanding a new census that would exclude undocumented
  migrants – moves that will either help Republicans win in 2026 or else enable
  him to argue that a Democratic victory was illegitimate and should be
  overturned. In that same spirit, the Trump White House now argues that, in
  effect, only one party should be allowed to exercise power in the US. How else
  to read the words of key Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who this week told Fox
  News that “The Democrat party is not a political party; it is a domestic
  extremist organisation.” It’s the same picture on every front, whether it’s
  plans for a new military parade in Trump’s honour or the firing of health
  officials who insist on putting science ahead of political loyalty. He is bent
  on amassing power to himself and being seen to amass power to himself, even if
  that means departing from economic conservative orthodoxy to have the federal
  government take a stake in hitherto private companies. He wants to rule over
  every aspect of US life. As Trump himself said this week, “A lot of people are
  saying, ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” The former Obama adviser David Axelrod
  is not alone when he says, “We have gone from zero to Hungary faster than I
  ever imagined.” The trouble is, people still don’t talk about it the way they
  talk about Hungary, not inside the US and not outside it. That’s partly the It
  Can’t Happen Here mindset, partly a reluctance to accept a reality that would
  require, of foreign governments especially, a rethink of almost everything. If
  the US is on its way to autocracy, in a condition scholars might call
  “unconsolidated authoritarianism”, then that changes Britain’s entire
  strategic position, its place in the world, which for 80 years has been
  predicated on the notion of a west led by a stable, democratic US. The same
  goes for the EU. Far easier to carry on, either pretending that the
  transformation of the US is not, in fact, as severe as it is, or that normal
  service will resume shortly. But the world’s leaders, like US citizens, cannot
  ignore the evidence indefinitely. To adapt the title of that long-ago novel,
  it can happen here – and it is. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist
