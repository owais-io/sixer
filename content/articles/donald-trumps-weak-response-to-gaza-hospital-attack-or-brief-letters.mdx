  Had the nationality of the at least 193 journalists reporting on Gaza and
  killed since 7 October 2023 been American rather than Palestinian, would
  Donald Trump’s reaction have been any stronger than “I’m not happy about it”
  (Israel bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health
  officials, 25 August)? Anne Plunkett Shelf, West Yorkshire • Your article on
  “performative males” (22 August) put me in mind of Jenny Eclair’s comedy
  routine about the need a boy has for a “northern mother”; she suggested
  Michael Jackson needed one to tell him to “go and fetch your other glove,
  Michael”. The equivalent today would presumably be “and take that Labubu off
  your belt”. Deb Groves Ribchester, Lancashire • August has hitherto been known
  in political circles as the “silly season”? Now that Nigel Farage has taken
  (back) control of the agenda, I’m with the late Edna O’Brien: “August is a
  wicked month”. Les Bright Exeter, Devon • I have a few vintage one-inch
  micrometers that fit snugly in a spectacle case (Letters, 22 August), keeping
  a precision instrument safe. Chris Arrowsmith Cam, Gloucestershire • A surplus
  spectacle case lends itself to becoming a travelling humidor. Open and hold it
  over a steaming kettle for two seconds, pop in your cigar, and snap shut.
  Richard Barnard Wivenhoe, Essex • I find them particularly useful for storing
  35mm film canisters. Andrew Eccles Gourock, Inverclyde • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
