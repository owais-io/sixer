  The richest rivalries are the lifeblood of an AFL season. They are born
  naturally, set hearts racing and get blood boiling. A shared history of fiery
  clashes, tight and contentious finishes, or simply close proximity, give a
  game soul even when there is little at stake beyond pride and bragging rights.
  They tend to be at their best when a deep and long-running feud comes together
  in a finals series. Adelaide and Collingwood have had a fresh rivalry brewing
  for years. A pair of large and fervent fanbases used to turning their home
  stadiums into a one-eyed cauldron of noise already have their fair share of
  historical and heated opponents. But as the temperature has soared in recent
  contests between the two teams, another arch-rival is ready to be added to
  each of their lists of nemeses. Close encounters have made this one of the
  must-watch matchups in recent seasons. Even as the Crows took time to edge
  their way back into the top eight, and the Magpies mostly remained on their
  perch higher up, the past six games have been decided by only a combined 25
  points. The Pies held sway for the first five of those tense tussles, as they
  opened up an 11-match unbeaten run against the Crows. Ahead of finals sign up
  for our free weekly AFL newsletter Dubious decisions in the dying stages of
  thrillers have added fuel to the fire. The AFL conceding that the umpires got
  a critical non-call wrong at the MCG was next to no consolation when it came
  in the days after Collingwood overran Adelaide in a pulsating contest in 2023.
  Jordan Dawson should have been paid a free kick, the AFL acknowledged, when
  Magpies forward Jamie Elliott not only caught the Crows captain high but left
  him with a bleeding lip. But nothing could change that Dawson was denied what
  would have been a shot at goal after the siren as the Pies grimly held on by
  two points. Controversy was back at the MCG just a year later when the Crows
  were again on the wrong side of a debatable decision. Izak Rankine had already
  booted a stunning goal early in the last term to give his side a sniff, before
  he burst away from a stoppage on the wing with less than 30 seconds remaining
  and the Crows trailing by four points. The livewire took a bounce and then
  kept charging forward to launch one last attack with a long bomb inside 50.
  But when the umpire’s whistle was belatedly blown for Rankine running too far,
  the Pies had piled more misery on the Crows. The tables were finally turned in
  their most recent clash, with the Crows this time leading in the dying stages.
  Nick Daicos slotted a long-range shot to give the Magpies hope and leave the
  Crows searching for ways to slow the game down. Adelaide forward Riley
  Thilthorpe was fortunate not to give away a free kick when booting the ball
  out of sight after it had trickled over the boundary line with under a minute
  left on the clock. The Crows held on by three points to snap their horror
  streak against the Pies and seal a top-two spot. But a new nightmare was to
  come their way in the aftermath. Rankine was back in the spotlight, this time
  for all the wrong reasons, as it was revealed the following day that he had
  directed a homophobic slur at a Collingwood player during the match at
  Adelaide Oval. The 25-year-old was banned for four matches, and still has
  three to serve. Meanwhile the Crows return to the finals for the first time
  since 2017 without their star player available to face the Pies. In a bitter
  irony, only a Collingwood victory in the qualifying final this week can open
  up a pathway for Rankine to play if Adelaide go on to reach this year’s
  decider. The crucial ingredients of recent years and the extra spice over the
  past few weeks have been thrown in the same pot to leave the Crows and Magpies
  rivalry bubbling away. It will be no surprise if it spills over when they meet
  again on Thursday night. A clash of styles that somehow brings the sides
  closer together is also on the cards. The Crows must seek to open up their
  opponents and move the ball quickly to their formidable forward line that has
  made them the second-highest scoring team among the finalists. The Pies are
  filled with elder statesmen and comfortable with a more measured and cautious
  contest, which is partly why they have the most miserly defence in the league
  but failed to make the most of having 71 inside-50s the last time these teams
  met. Whichever way they do it, both sides are among the top three for the
  modern-day metric of points scored from turnover differential – the
  increasingly important ability to punish opponents for their mistakes. That
  won’t be enough for a shootout at Adelaide Oval but could mean one side
  inflicts more wounds on the other than we have seen in the past six meetings
  between these two evenly-matched teams.
