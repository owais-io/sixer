  Rosie O’Donnell: Common Knowledge review – sentimental sermon with a
  self-mocking edge
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  A month ago, Donald Trump branded comedian Rosie O’Donnell a “threat to
  humanity” and threatened to revoke her US citizenship. Judging by this fringe
  hour, he’d be welcome to it. Common Knowledge is a hymn of praise to
  O’Donnell’s new home, Ireland, where she and her child Clay moved at the time
  of Trump’s inauguration. Clay, who is non-binary, is the other focus of the
  show, and of their mum’s rapturous affections, in a set that’s more a love
  letter to these two presences in the 63-year-old’s life than it is let-it-rip
  comedy. The show is bookended by reflections on O’Donnell’s mother, whose
  death when our host was 10 years old is recounted in a solemn opening. Now a
  parent to five adopted children, motherhood is clearly a major concern of the
  comedian, and here we get the whole story, with a slide show, of how Clay
  arrived in her life. Autistic, prodigiously intelligent, fearlessly
  truth-telling, this is a child who dismays and instructs their mother in equal
  measure. That cycle supplies the show’s rhythm: we get the funny story about
  Clay’s behaviour, then the earnest lesson O’Donnell has derived from it. That,
  combined with a sonorous and sentimental quality to the storytelling, can make
  Common Knowledge more sermon than standup. At points, it’s a rallying call for
  autism awareness. Elsewhere, it plays like a heartfelt thank you to Ireland
  (which she keeps referring to as “here”) for saving the New Yorker from
  depression and the disintegrating US, with O’Donnell starry-eyed at how safe,
  cheap and progressive her perfect new homeland seems to be. But the
  earnestness is regularly punctured with self-mocking comedy, as with the tale
  of Rosie and her then teenage son’s joint visit to her therapist; or the story
  of her mistaking the friendliness of her new Irish pharmacist for flirtation,
  with humiliating consequences. There’s no standup cut and thrust to this:
  O’Donnell cleaves tightly to her script and stately delivery. But the tale
  she’s telling means a lot to her and she tells it authoritatively, and with
  enough irony, self-reflection and (Trump, take note) humanity – to make it
  engaging for the rest of us. At Orchard at the Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh,
