  The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can no longer be considered a
  low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making deep cuts to fossil fuel
  emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic impact. The Atlantic
  meridional overturning circulation (Amoc) is a major part of the global
  climate system. It brings sun-warmed tropical water to Europe and the Arctic,
  where it cools and sinks to form a deep return current. The Amoc was already
  known to be at its weakest in 1,600 years as a result of the climate crisis.
  Climate models recently indicated that a collapse before 2100 was unlikely but
  the new analysis examined models that were run for longer, to 2300 and 2500.
  These show the tipping point that makes an Amoc shutdown inevitable is likely
  to be passed within a few decades, but that the collapse itself may not happen
  until 50 to 100 years later. The research found that if carbon emissions
  continued to rise, 70% of the model runs led to collapse, while an
  intermediate level of emissions resulted in collapse in 37% of the models.
  Even in the case of low future emissions, an Amoc shutdown happened in 25% of
  the models. Scientists have warned previously that Amoc collapse must be
  avoided “at all costs”. It would shift the tropical rainfall belt on which
  many millions of people rely to grow their food, plunge western Europe into
  extreme cold winters and summer droughts, and add 50cm to already rising sea
  levels. The new results are “quite shocking, because I used to say that the
  chance of Amoc collapsing as a result of global warming was less than 10%”,
  said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact
  Research in Germany, who was part of the study team. “Now even in a
  low-emission scenario, sticking to the Paris agreement, it looks like it may
  be more like 25%. “These numbers are not very certain, but we are talking
  about a matter of risk assessment where even a 10% chance of an Amoc collapse
  would be far too high. We found that the tipping point where the shutdown
  becomes inevitable is probably in the next 10 to 20 years or so. That is quite
  a shocking finding as well and why we have to act really fast in cutting down
  emissions.” Scientists spotted warning signs of a tipping point in 2021 and
  know that the Amoc has collapsed in the Earth’s past. “Observations in the
  deep [far North Atlantic] already show a downward trend over the past five to
  10 years, consistent with the models’ projections,” said Prof Sybren
  Drijfhout, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, who was also
  part of the team. “Even in some intermediate and low-emission scenarios, the
  Amoc slows drastically by 2100 and completely shuts off thereafter. That shows
  the shutdown risk is more serious than many people realise.” The study,
  published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, analysed the standard
  models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The
  scientists were particularly concerned to find that in many models the tipping
  point is reached in the next decade or two, after which the shutdown of the
  Amoc becomes inevitable owing to a self-amplifying feedback. Air temperatures
  are rising rapidly in the Arctic becauseof the climate crisis, meaning the
  ocean cools more slowly there. Warmer water is less dense and therefore sinks
  into the depths more slowly. This slowing allows more rainfall to accumulate
  in the salty surface waters, also making it less dense, and further slowing
  the sinking, forming the feedback loop. Another new study, using a different
  approach, also found the tipping point is probably going to be reached around
  the middle of this century. Only some of the IPCC models have been run beyond
  2100, so the researchers also looked to see which of those running to the end
  of this century showed Amoc was already in terminal decline. This produced the
  70%, 37% and 25% figures. The scientists concluded: “Such numbers no longer
  comply with the low-likelihood-high-impact event that is used to discuss an
  abrupt Amoc collapse in [the IPCC’s last report].” Rahmstorf said the true
  figures could be even worse, because the models did not include the torrent of
  meltwater from the Greenland ice cap that is also freshening the ocean waters.
  Dr Aixue Hu at the Global Climate Dynamics Laboratory in Colorado, US, who was
  not part of the study team, said the results were important. “But it is still
  very uncertain when Amoc collapse will happen or when the Amoc tipping point
  is going to crossed because of the lack of direct observations [of the ocean]
  and the varying results from the models.” The study that found that a total
  collapse of the Amoc was unlikely this century was led by Dr Jonathan Baker at
  the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. “This new study highlights that the
  risk rises after 2100,” he said. “[But] these percentages should be treated
  with caution – the sample size is small, so more simulations [beyond 2100] are
  needed to better quantify the risk.” Nonetheless, Baker said, “the ocean is
  already changing, and projected shifts in North Atlantic convection are a real
  concern. Even if a collapse is unlikely, a major weakening is expected, and
  that alone could have serious impacts on Europe’s climate in the decades to
  come. But the future of the Atlantic circulation is still in our hands.”
