  Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has visited Gaza and been shown one of the
  controversial food distribution sites around which hundreds of Palestinians
  have been killed by Israeli forces. Witkoff, the US president’s special envoy
  for the Middle East, had earlier met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
  Netanyahu, amid mounting international horror over conditions of starvation in
  Gaza occurring after months of Israeli-imposed aid restrictions. Witkoff – a
  former real estate lawyer with no background in foreign policy or humanitarian
  aid – wrote on X that he had spent more than five hours inside Gaza in order
  to gain “a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a
  plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza”. Chapin Fay, a
  spokesperson for the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF),
  said the visit reflected Trump’s understanding of the crisis and that “feeding
  civilians, not Hamas, must be the priority”. The apparent absence of senior
  international aid officials during a visit accompanied by senior Israeli
  figures raises questions over the credibility of Israeli and US plans to
  increase aid flows amid the continuing debacle around the GHF operations.
  Trump echoed his intention to increase aid reaching Gaza in a phone call with
  the US news site Axios, saying: “We want to help people. We want to help them
  live. We want to get people fed. It is something that should have happened
  long time ago.” It remains unclear whether Trump intends to double down on an
  expansion of the GHF operations or envisages a new way of doing things. Hours
  after Witkoff’s visit to the site in Rafah, Palestinian medics said they
  received the bodies of 13 people shot dead by Israeli forces while trying to
  get aid, including near the site that US officials visited. GHF denied anyone
  was killed at their sites on Friday. Witkoff visited as Human Rights Watch
  described the sites run by the GHF as “death traps” which had become the scene
  of regular “bloodbaths”. The UN has said that Israeli forces have killed
  almost 900 Palestinians who were attempting to reach the sites. Belkis Wille,
  the associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch, said on
  Friday: “US-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a
  flawed, militarised aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions
  into regular bloodbaths.” She added: “Israeli forces are not only deliberately
  starving Palestinian civilians, but they are now gunning them down almost
  every day as they desperately seek food for their families.” The UN said on
  Friday that Israeli forces had killed 1,353 Palestinians who were waiting for
  food – 859 around GHF sites and another 514 along the route of UN aid convoys.
  The health ministry in Gaza said that 83 people had been killed and 554
  wounded by IDF fire in the territory in the past 24 hours. According to the
  announcement, 53 were killed and more than 400 were wounded while seeking
  humanitarian aid. A UN spokesperson said Israeli policies had led to the
  widespread desperation in Gaza that meant arriving UN trucks were overwhelmed
  and stripped before they could reach warehouses. The UN says longstanding
  Israeli restrictions on the entry of aid has created an unpredictable
  environment, and that means, while a pause in fighting might allow more aid
  in, Palestinians are not confident aid will reach them. Olga Cherevko, a
  spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
  (Ocha), said: “This has resulted in many of our convoys offloaded directly by
  starving, desperate people as they continue to face deep levels of hunger and
  are struggling to feed their families. The only way to reach a level of
  confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time.” While
  a number of countries have resumed airdrops of aid into Gaza in recent days,
  aid experts have warned that the amount of food that can be dropped by air is
  insufficient to counter starvation inside the Palestinian territory. On
  Friday, Hamas released a brief video of an emaciated and bearded Israeli
  hostage held in a narrow concrete tunnel in Gaza. Israeli media identified as
  Evyatar David, who was seized at the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023. Of
  the 251 hostages taken during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in
  Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead. Israeli officials have
  said that if there is no progress in the coming days on a deal with Hamas to
  release the hostages, Israel will expand its operations in Gaza. International
  humanitarian agencies and experts say that famine has gripped Gaza after
  Israel blocked food from entering the territory for two and a half months
  starting in March. Since it eased the blockade in late May, Israel has only
  allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the UN, about 70 a day on average,
  according to Israel’s own figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day
  that UN agencies say are needed – the amount that entered during a six-week
  ceasefire earlier this year. While Netanyahu and other officials have claimed
  that there is “no hunger in Gaza” or that it is the fault of Hamas looting or
  the UN’s failings, incontrovertible evidence has been offered by the UN’s food
  security monitor of the spread of famine amid Israel’s choking of the entry of
  aid, a policy critics say amounts to the crime of using starvation as a
  weapon.
