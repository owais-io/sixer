  Zoe Williams is sadly not alone in being unable to identify 30 plants a week
  to eat (We should all be eating 30 different plants a week. I can’t even name
  that many, 19 August). Nowadays 50% of the world’s daily calorie intake comes
  from just three species: wheat, corn and rice. In 2020, I decided to live off
  “foraging for nettles” – as Zoe puts it – for a year in Scotland, eating only
  free, wild food. During that period I ate 300 plant species, 21 seaweed
  species and 87 types of mushroom. This is not untypical of hunter-gatherer
  intake, and most Indigenous six-year-olds can identify the same number of
  plants as an adult. While commercially produced and processed foods provide
  calories, it is plants that produce the incredible variety of micronutrients,
  antioxidants, flavonoids etc that our bodies need to stay healthy and free of
  the inflammation that causes pain and so many “modern diseases”. The Wildbiome
  Project measured the health metrics of 120 people who ate only wild foods for
  periods of one or three months in 2023 and 2025. The results are fascinating,
  with many unexpected improvements across a range of health issues. These will
  soon be published in an open-source, peer-reviewed journal. The inability to
  name fruit and vegetable species is a reflection of a wider general decline in
  familiarity with the natural world. It goes along with the growing inability
  to identify trees, birds, butterflies and insects. The loss of names
  translates to a loss of awareness, which blinds us to species decline and
  extinction. Sadly, we don’t miss unnamed, vanished species until it’s too late
  – whether in the outside world or inside our guts. Mo Wilde Principal
  researcher, The Wildbiome Project • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in
