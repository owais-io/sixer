  The government is looking at a “range of appropriate accommodation” in which
  to house asylum seekers in England, the Home Office minister Dan Jarvis told
  BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. He refused to specify what kind of
  accommodation was under consideration, although he acknowledged that “nobody
  really thinks that hotels are a suitable location” after this week’s high
  court ruling. But the options are limited. What is the issue? The Home Office
  is responsible for ensuring compliance with the UK’s legal commitments
  regarding asylum seekers. That includes supporting destitute people seeking
  asylum while it makes a decision on their claim, by providing financial
  support and accommodation. Asylum seekers are initially housed in
  “contingency” accommodation, such as hotels, hostels or special secure
  facilities. Later they may be moved to “dispersal” accommodation, including
  shared houses or self-contained flats or houses. The number of people seeking
  asylum who were accommodated by the government has increased from about 47,000
  in December 2019 to about 110,000 in December 2024. Hotels About 200 hotels
  were housing more than 30,000 asylum seekers in England and Wales at the end
  of March 2025. Since 2020, there has been greater reliance on hotels to house
  asylum seekers, but Labour has promised to end the use of hotels by 2029 by
  cutting small boat crossings and building new government-owned accommodation.
  According to the Migration Observatory, in 2024-25 the average daily cost of
  housing an asylum seeker in a hotel was estimated at £170 per person, compared
  with £27 for other types of accommodation – more than six times more
  expensive. In recent months there have been protests outside some asylum
  hotels, with some people claiming they pose a threat to the safety of the
  neighbourhood. The protests have often been orchestrated by the far right.
  This week the high court granted an interim injunction to Epping Forest
  district council to stop asylum seekers from being placed at the Bell hotel,
  after protests nearby. The government is braced for dozens of legal challenges
  from other council leaders after the ruling. Home Office lawyers told the
  court that the decision could “substantially impact” the government’s ability
  to house asylum seekers in hotels across the UK. Flats and houses A possible
  alternative is for the government to house asylum seekers in flats or houses
  rented from private landlords or social housing providers. In December 2023,
  about 56,500 people were in dispersal accommodation, meaning flats or houses
  occupied by single families or multiple single people, according to the
  National Audit Office. However, if the government opted to increase the
  proportion of asylum seekers in flats and houses, it would increase pressure
  on the rental sector at a time when finding accommodation is extremely
  competitive and rents have gone up significantly. It may also increase the
  vulnerability of asylum seekers to protesters. Plans to accommodate 35
  families in flats above shops in Waterlooville, Hampshire, were dropped
  earlier this month after more than 1,000 people protested in the town. Last
  October, a Home Office lease on flats at Pinehurst Hill Side in Farnborough,
  Hampshire, was not renewed after protests. Alex Baker, the local MP, said
  “many residents were aspiring to live in” the newly built town-centre
  accommodation. Large sites or camps In 2022, the Conservative government said
  it would use “large sites”, such as former military facilities, barges,
  ferries, and cruise ships, to reduce reliance on hotels for asylum
  accommodation. The Home Office planned to house 1,875 people in large sites by
  January 2024, but only 900 were accommodated by that date. “On 31 December
  2024, this number had dropped to 500 following the closure of the Bibby
  Stockholm barge,” said the Migration Observatory. The Bibby Stockholm, a
  converted barge moored in Portland, Dorset, was decommissioned by the Labour
  government in November 2024 amid safety concerns, protests and condemnation
  from campaign groups. The barge, which provided accommodation for about 400
  single male asylum seekers a night at maximum occupancy, had cost the taxpayer
  at least £34.8m, according to the National Audit Office. Labour said it would
  end the use of all large secure sites to accommodate asylum seekers but may
  now be forced to reconsider. For example, Wethersfield, a former Ministry of
  Defence site in Braintree, Essex, may increase its capacity to house single
  adult male asylum seekers between the ages of 18 and 65. According to Graham
  Butland, the Conservative leader of Braintree district council, the current
  number of about 800 men could increase to 1,220. A report from the National
  Audit Office in 2024 found that the costs of large sites were significantly
  higher than expected. This was largely because of the Home Office
  overestimating occupancy rates and underestimating the expenses associated
  with the setup and refurbishment of these sites. What do other counties do? In
  Germany, many asylum seekers are housed in initial reception centres – large
  facilities with dormitory-style accommodation. People can stay in these
  centres for 18 months or longer before being transferred to collective
  accommodation centres or decentralised housing. The type of housing varies by
  region and may include former army barracks, housing containers, or
  self-contained flats. In France, reception centres (Centre d’Accueil pour
  Demandeurs d’Asile – CADA) serve as the main form of accommodation for asylum
  seekers. These can be either collective or private accommodation within the
  same building or separate flats, usually managed by NGOs. Likewise in Spain,
  reception centres (Centro de Acogida a Refugiados – CAR) are the primary
  accommodation facilities. In France and Spain, there is a shortage of
  accommodation, leaving many asylum seekers in informal camps or settlements.
  In Sweden, asylum seekers are primarily housed in shared flats through a
  dispersal accommodation system, although municipalities face difficulties in
  securing suitable housing.
