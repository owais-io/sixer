  Dozens of countries face higher levies on their exports to the US now that
  Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs has come into force.
  The sweeping “reciprocal” rates announced by the White House a week ago – just
  before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in place as of a
  minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Just before midnight, Trump
  claimed on social media that billions of dollars would start flowing into the
  US as a result of the tariffs. However, while the customs duties make
  countries’ exports more expensive and less competitive, they are payable on
  import and usually passed on to the customer. “The only thing that can stop
  America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our
  country fail,” the president wrote in capital letters, referencing an ongoing
  case in the US court of appeals which is considering whether he exceeded his
  authority in imposing the “reciprocal” tariffs. The rates range from 41% on
  war-torn Syria to 10% for the UK and will be applied on top of the usual
  tariffs applying to products imported to the US. This means that while
  Brazil’s “reciprocal” level is 10%, its total rate is 50% after an executive
  order imposed a 40% additional levy from Wednesday linked to the prosecution
  of the country’s former president Jair Bolsonaro. The EU is the only trading
  partner where its baseline rate – set at 15% after a framework deal – will
  include previous tariffs. It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit
  with import duties of 14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%. Since the
  announcement late on Thursday last week, governments around the world have
  been racing to try to reach deals to avert border taxes they fear could deter
  investors and result in job losses. The Swiss president, Karin Keller-Sutter,
  was in Washington on Tuesday for two days of meetings with senior Trump
  administration officials to try to reverse a 39% levy that blindsided the
  government when it was unveiled. The Swiss government were set to hold an
  “extraordinary meeting” on Thursday, following the return of officials from
  Washington Meanwhile, India’s 25% tariff rate could rise to a total of 50%
  after Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday imposing an additional levy
  in retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia. Delhi has 21
  days to respond. Trump has threatened to use the same tactic on other
  countries that supply Russia. Trump first unveiled the raft of
  country-specific rates on 2 April, a date he called “liberation day”, claiming
  the rest of the world had looted the US for decades. After a 90-day pause
  brought in a week later and another four-week truce announced on 7 July, he
  confirmed the new set of rates last Friday. Some trading partners secured
  reductions via negotiations or by striking deals, including the UK, Thailand,
  Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan
  and the EU. Other countries are negotiating tariffs not covered by last week’s
  announcement. Canada has been hit with a total rate of 35% that came in last
  Friday, while Mexico avoided an increase from its 25% rate on the same date
  after it was granted a 90-day extension. China faces a 30% rate while
  negotiations continue before its separate 12 August deadline for higher rates.
  On Wednesday, Trump also warned that the US would impose a tariff of about
  100% on semiconductor chips imported from countries not producing in America
  or planning to do so. • The headline and text of this article were amended on
  7 August 2025 to add clarity on who pays for tariffs.
