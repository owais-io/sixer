  to piracy

  With a trip to Florence booked, all I want is to rewatch Medici. The 2016
  historical drama series tells of the rise of the powerful Florentine banking
  dynasty, and with it, the story of the Renaissance. Until recently, I could
  simply have gone to Netflix and found it there, alongside a wide array of
  award-winning and obscure titles. But when I Google the show in 2025, the
  Netflix link only takes me to a blank page. I don’t see it on HBO Max,
  Disney+, Apple TV+, or any of the smaller streaming platforms. On Amazon Prime
  I am required to buy each of the three seasons or 24 episodes separately,
  whereupon they would be stored in a library subject to overnight deletion.
  Raised in the land of The Pirate Bay, the Swedish torrent index, I feel, for
  the first time in a decade, a nostalgia for the high seas of digital piracy.
  And I am not alone. For my teenage self in the 00s, torrenting was the norm.
  Need the new Coldplay album on your iPod? The Pirate Bay. The 1968 adaptation
  of Romeo and Juliet? The Pirate Bay. Whatever you needed was accessible with
  just a couple of clicks. But as smartphones proliferated, so did Spotify, the
  music streaming platform that is also headquartered in Sweden. The same
  Scandinavian country had become a hub of illegal torrenting and simultaneously
  conjured forth its solution. “Spotify would never have seen the light of day
  without The Pirate Bay,” Per Sundin, the then managing director of Universal
  Music Sweden, reflected in 2011. But music torrenting died out as we all
  either listened with ads or paid for the subscription. And when Netflix
  launched in Sweden in late 2012, open talk of torrenting moving images also
  stopped. Most of the big shows and a great collection of award-winning films
  could all be found for just 79 SEK (£6) a month. Meanwhile, the three founders
  of The Pirate Bay were arrested and eventually jailed. Pirating faded into the
  history books as far as I was concerned. A decade and a half on from the
  Pirate Bay trial, the winds have begun to shift. On an unusually warm summer’s
  day, I sit with fellow film critics by the old city harbour, once a haven for
  merchants and, rumour has it, smugglers. Cold bigstrongs in hand (that’s what
  they call pints up here), they start venting about the “enshittification” of
  streaming – enshittification being the process by which platforms degrade
  their services and ultimately die in the pursuit of profit. Netflix now costs
  upwards of 199 SEK (£15), and you need more and more subscriptions to watch
  the same shows you used to find in one place. Most platforms now offer plans
  that, despite the fee, force advertisements on subscribers. Regional
  restrictions often compel users to use VPNs to access the full selection of
  available content. The average European household now spends close to €700
  (£600) a year on three or more VOD subscriptions. People pay more and get
  less. A fellow film critic confides anonymously: “I never stopped pirating,
  and my partner also does it if he doesn’t find the precise edition he is
  looking for on DVD.” While some people never abandoned piracy, others admit
  they have recently returned – this time turning to unofficial streaming
  platforms. One commonly used app is legal but can, through community add-ons,
  channel illicit streams. “Downloading is too difficult. I don’t know where to
  start,” says one film viewer. “The shady streams might bombard me with ads,
  but at least I don’t have to worry about getting hacked or caught.” According
  to London‑based piracy monitoring and content‑protection firm MUSO, unlicensed
  streaming is the predominant source of TV and film piracy, accounting for 96%
  in 2023. Piracy reached a low in 2020, with 130bn website visits. But by 2024
  that number had risen to 216bn. In Sweden, 25% of people surveyed reported
  pirating in 2024, a trend mostly driven by those aged 15 to 24. Piracy is
  back, just sailing under a different flag. “Piracy is not a pricing issue,”
  Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve, the company behind the world’s largest
  PC gaming platform, Steam, observed in 2011. “It’s a service issue.” Today,
  the crisis in streaming makes this clearer than ever. With titles scattered,
  prices on the rise, and bitrates throttled depending on your browser, it is
  little wonder some viewers are raising the jolly roger again. Studios carve
  out fiefdoms, build walls and levy tolls for those who wish to visit. The
  result is artificial scarcity in a digital world that promised abundance.
  Whether piracy today is rebellion or resignation is almost irrelevant; the
  sails are hoisted either way. As the streaming landscape fractures into feudal
  territories, more viewers are turning to the high seas. The Medici understood
  the value linked to access. A client could travel from Rome to London and
  still draw on their credit, thanks to a network built on trust and
  interoperability. If today’s studios want to survive the storm, they may need
  to rediscover that truth.
