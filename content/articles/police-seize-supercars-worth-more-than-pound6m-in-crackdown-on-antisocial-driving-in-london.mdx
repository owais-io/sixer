  Police have seized dozens of supercars collectively worth more than £6m,
  including Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bentleys, during a crackdown on
  antisocial driving in London. Seventy-two luxury vehicles were taken off the
  streets in an operation targeting nuisance driving in the West End after
  complaints from residents, businesses and visitors about high-value cars
  causing disruption in and around Hyde Park, Kensington and Chelsea. The
  Metropolitan police said the cars, including twin purple Lamborghinis, were
  either unroadworthy or being driven illegally. Officers worked with the Motor
  Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) last weekend to issue tickets for a range of offences
  including driving with no insurance, no licence, disqualification, false
  documentation and fraudulent number plates. Several stolen vehicles were
  recovered, with 10 others found to have no valid MoT and 11 without road tax.
  Special chief officer James Deller, from the Met’s Special Constabulary, said:
  “The Met has already reduced neighbourhood crime by 19% over recent months and
  we’re addressing antisocial behaviour caused by uninsured drivers. “This has
  been a great opportunity to work with the Motor Insurers’ Bureau and for
  officers to speak with members of the public about the work we do, educate
  drivers and enforce the law.” Eight people were arrested for alleged offences
  including actual bodily harm (ABH), criminal damage, drug offences, theft and
  immigration breaches, the force added. Martin Saunders, the head of uninsured
  driving prevention at the MIB, said: “We urge all motorists to check their
  insurance policy is in place, is appropriate for their needs, and to reach out
  to their insurer if they are unsure on any part of their policy.”
