  Covid is on the rise again in the US, as children begin returning to school
  and as officials plan to restrict booster shots. While cases are increasing
  less quickly than at the start of other surges, it is too soon to tell how big
  the current late-summer wave could get – and with highly varied immune
  responses from prior infections and vaccinations, it is difficult to know how
  severe illness could be, experts said. The risks of a wave are compounded by
  new vaccine restrictions from the Trump administration. “If you’re vaccinated
  against Covid-19, you’re less likely to get infected,” said Andrew Pekosz, a
  virologist at Johns Hopkins University. “But we haven’t gotten a lot of people
  vaccinated for the past few years, and with the current recommendations
  changing, it’s even less likely.” Future waves could become more severe as
  vaccination lags and immunity drops, Pekosz said. Several key measurements –
  including wastewater data, test positivity and emergency room visits –
  indicate a new rise in infections. In the past, Covid has surged about twice a
  year, usually in the summer and the winter. But the pattern can change, as it
  does with other respiratory viruses – with late or early starts to the season
  and curveballs like double peaks. “Each year has been different, so in some
  ways, this is more of the same,” said Sam Scarpino, a professor of health
  sciences at Northeastern University. Cases are increasing or probably
  increasing in 26 US states, especially in the south and midwest, according to
  the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “In the snapshot that
  we’re seeing right now, increases are happening at a relatively low rate, and
  that would indicate that we probably aren’t going to peak at a very high
  level. But again, this is early in this summer surge, so we really have to
  keep monitoring the data and paying attention to what it’s telling us,” Pekosz
  said. The variants currently spreading around the globe have known
  immune-evasion properties, Scarpino said. “You can look at the rise that we’re
  seeing, the fact that we know it’s an immune-escape variant, and I think we
  can be pretty confident that there’s some kind of wave coming,” Scarpino said.
  “Whether it’s going to be large or small, I don’t think we could really say
  one way or the other.” But “the vaccines are still providing some protection,”
  he said. “It’s never too late to get the booster.” Yet officials softened the
  recommendation for children on Covid vaccines, and they removed the suggestion
  entirely for pregnant people, despite the clear benefits of the shot in
  reducing the risk of severe illness and death during pregnancy. A new, more
  effective Covid shot from Moderna and the Covid shot from Novavax were
  approved only for people over 65 or people over the age of 12 with health
  conditions. The independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration
  (FDA) recommended that vaccine manufacturers once again update booster shots
  this fall to a more recent variant. Covid boosters are usually recommended for
  all adults. But this fall, the boosters may be limited to older people and
  those with health conditions, FDA officials wrote in May. “So it’s a big
  question mark, going into the fall, is who it’s going to be approved for,”
  Scarpino said. “If it’s not approved, can you still pay out of pocket for it?
  How much is it going to cost? And then are there going to be supply chain
  issues?” Health officials have also called for placebo trials for the boosters
  to judge their benefit to people without pre-existing conditions – but such
  trials would be unethical and extremely difficult to conduct, experts say.
  “Clearly, the guidelines right now are focused on the populations that are
  more prone to have severe disease and severe outcomes. It’s always been good
  to vaccinate that population,” Pekosz said. But the Trump administration is
  moving away from the approach of immunizing broad swaths of the population –
  especially those most likely to get and pass the virus on, like children, he
  said. “If you vaccinate broadly, you can reduce the spread of Covid-19 in the
  population,” Pekosz said. “The benefit, to me, is very clearly on the side of
  getting vaccinated.” Some of the pre-existing conditions proposed by FDA
  officials include asthma, diabetes, depression and physical inactivity.
  According to that list, “basically everybody’s eligible for one of the
  vaccines,” Scarpino said. And doctors, including pediatricians, may also
  prescribe vaccines for off-label use. Yet the more restrictions are placed on
  vaccination, the harder it is to reach even the people who need it most,
  Pekosz noted. Antivirals like Paxlovid could also see wider use, the experts
  said. “We shouldn’t forget about the antivirals,” Pekosz said. “Those don’t
  seem to be the target of more restrictive use by the CDC or the FDA, so those
  will be available for people if they do get infected.” A program to make
  Paxlovid more affordable to those who need it is slated to end in December.
  “The benefits of antiviral treatment are very clear with respect to
  hospitalization and mortality decreases,” Pekosz said. Paxlovid is still
  highly effective against current variants, Scarpino said. “There’s a whole
  bunch of good reasons to get it.” Rates of hospitalizations and deaths in
  recent waves have dropped among adults compared with earlier Covid waves, but
  the virus remains deadly. An estimated 35,000 to 54,000 people in the US have
  died of Covid since October. Children continue to see hospitalizations rates
  from Covid similar to previous years. Covid cases can be less severe because
  of immunity – from prior infection or from vaccination. “It’s not so much that
  the virus has become less dangerous, it’s that we have immunity, so we fight
  off the virus more efficiently than we did early in the pandemic,” Pekosz
  said. That’s why vaccinations remain a key part of controlling Covid, he said.
  Without boosters, people become more susceptible to severe illness and death.
  About 23% of adults had received updated Covid boosters as of April. About
  5.6% of children aged six months to four years are vaccinated against Covid,
  and about 15% of children aged five to 17 are vaccinated, according to the
  CDC. “Children’s cases are always surging, because children don’t have much
  immunity to Covid,” Pekosz said. “Covid cases are really occurring in children
  at a very high level right now. It’s not nearly as dangerous in children as it
  is in adults, but it still causes a lot of hospitalizations in children.”
  Hospitalizations and deaths are not the only ways to measure the damage and
  disruption wrought by Covid. While the Trump administration has not released
  updated data on long Covid, an estimated 5.3% of all adults in the US said
  they were currently experiencing long-term Covid symptoms as of September.
  Even in times of lower transmission, Covid still circulates, with 149 deaths
  in the week ending 28 June, the last week for which the CDC shares full
  mortality data. “It’s still a little surprising that it’s around all year,”
  said Pekosz. During lull times, “we’re not seeing it disappear completely,
  like we do with other respiratory viruses.” When it comes to keeping rates of
  Covid low, “it’s all the same stuff we usually go over,” Pekosz said – getting
  vaccinated, taking precautions like masking and using air purifiers, and
  staying home if you’re sick. “But it’s just a very different environment these
  days. When the government doesn’t use the science to drive their decision
  making, you can see the confusion that it puts into the general public.”
