  Over the past two years, Kaique Vieira, AKA DJ K, has been crafting a new
  sound of São Paolo. Influenced by local favela street parties, the 24-year-old
  producer takes the distorted bass, Afro-Brazilian rhythms and vocal melodies
  of baile funk – a dance genre that originated in Brazil in the 80s – and adds
  a darker palette of reverb-laden vocal lines, rave sirens and buzzing synths
  to create a style he calls bruxaria (witchcraft). Vieira’s 2023 debut Pânico
  no Submundo was a 15-track introduction, harnessing the sound of blown-out
  speaker cones. Radio Libertadora! moves into even bolder and louder territory,
  developing his nascent genre into a source of dancefloor chaos. Opening with a
  sample of a 1969 radio speech by the revolutionary Carlos Marighella, which
  called on people to act against Brazil’s military dictatorship – and gives the
  album its title – Vieira sets the tone for the record as an energetic riposte
  to the current criminalisation of baile funk street parties. In his bruxaria
  universe, the beats are hard, vocals are screamed and bass is explosive,
  creating an overwhelming, apocalyptic sound. Mega Suicidio Auditivo features
  siren squeals, thunderous bass, radio jingle samples and shouted lyrics within
  the first 20 seconds, while Sua Filha Quer Os D layers rap verses and synth
  melody over the Islamic adhan call to prayer. Techno de Favelado veers
  seamlessly from harsh Berlin techno to trance and baile funk rhythm while
  featured Meduza tries to make herself heard. Vieira displays immense skill in
  balancing his arrangements and allowing each element, no matter how brash, to
  play clearly without collapsing into muddy loudness. Some listeners may find
  it too noisy, but succumb to Vieira’s relentless energy and there is freedom
  in the barrage of sounds – an invitation to lose yourself in the cacophony.
  Also out this month Australian ensemble Hand to Earth release their latest
  album Ŋurru Wäŋa (Room40). Ambient electronics and bass drones anchor First
  Nations singer Daniel Wilfred’s yearning vocalisations and Wáglilak language
  lyrics, producing six moving tracks that reflect on a search for home. Singer
  Ami Taf Ra’s debut The Prophet and the Madman (Brainfeeder) combines Arabic
  vocal melodies with spiritual jazz ensemble arrangements to create a sprawling
  and involved interpretation of the work of poet Kahlil Gibran; Kamasi
  Washington features on How I Became a Madman, a soaring, virtuosic highlight.
  Brazilian guitarist Atletas delivers a luscious and warmly intimate record in
  Reflexão Meteórica (Municipal K7). Shades of electronic percussion and synths
  blend with his finger-picked guitar melodies to produce wistful, shimmering
  soundscapes.
