  tequila?

  Ah, the pleasures of the time loop comedy! This wacky sub-genre could easily
  have been a novelty deployed once or twice then heard of no more, but the
  genius of Groundhog Day almost single-handedly entrenched it in the zeitgeist.
  Harold Ramis’ 1993 classic spawned an ever-expanding array of stories
  involving protagonists who find themselves doomed to repeat the same time
  period – be it day, night, wedding ceremony or alien invasion– again and
  again. Or could that be “blessed” to repeat it? While Bill Murray’s grouchy
  weatherman found himself trapped in a small town with crappy weather, Emily
  Browning’s protagonist Minnie in One More Shot can choose whether she wants to
  rewind time or keep moving forward. The narrative of Nick Clifford’s modestly
  enjoyable Australian film takes place at a New Year’s Eve party in 1999,
  attended by Minnie and several of her friends including Pia (Pallavi Sharda),
  who believes that pandemonium will erupt after midnight. She’s right, but for
  the wrong reasons. It’s not Y2K that ruptures reality but – wait for it – a
  bottle of tequila that enables Minnie to time travel. Every time she takes a
  shot, she’s transported back to the front door, to the start of the night,
  inevitably greeted by her friend Rodney (Ashley Zukerman) and old flame Joe
  (Sean Keenan). Initially Minnie believes she’s just experiencing “really
  intense deja vu”, before coming to terms with the bizarre nature of her
  ability to wind back the clock. The script (from Alice Foulcher and Gregory
  Erdstein, who helmed the sassy 2017 dramedy That’s Not Me) makes it clear that
  Minnie is no benevolent hero determined to right the world’s wrongs. She
  interprets the freak event as a justification to do a Julia Roberts from My
  Best Friend’s Wedding, setting out to destroy a romantic relationship between
  Joe and his new girlfriend (Aisha Dee, from Sissy and Safe Home). Joe was the
  reason Minnie attended the party, with the hope of restarting their
  relationship, or at least indulging in some carnal activity. A series of
  revelations provide various ethical reasons for Minnie to reconsider her
  plans, opening the door for a pat moral finale that, thankfully, never really
  eventuates. Clifford prefers a more playful, frisky tone, presenting a world
  in which doing the right thing is just one option in an infinite number of
  pathways. During its opening act, One More Shot feels like it’s treading
  water, fleshing out preliminary character development before the premise kicks
  in. It’s not badly staged but lacks zest and zeal; nothing pops. But things
  switch into higher gear when that bottle of booze becomes a sort of drinkable
  DeLorean, albeit with just one possible pitstop – back to the front door.
  Minnie always arrives there with a full bladder, sending her to the bathroom
  and into the space of a coke-snorting reveller (Hamish Michael). And just as
  Murray wakes every morning in Groundhog Day to Sonny &amp; Cher’s I Got You
  Babe, and Natasha Lyonne hears Harry Nilsson’s Gotta Get Up a zillion times in
  Russian Doll, Minnie is hit with James’s toe-tappin’ track Laid every time the
  door opens. Time loop movies often require substantial range from their lead
  actors; here Browning keeps it anchored with a strong and multifaceted
  performance, neither demanding our sympathies nor ignoring the possibility
  that Minnie may essentially be a decent person. After her initial shock, she
  decides to take her future (and her past) into her own hands, triggering a
  journey in which she’s by turn trapped and empowered, helpless and hopeful.
  Visually, One More Shot is pretty bland; the characters party like it’s 1999
  but the aesthetics of the film itself are pretty staid. A livelier party –
  like the one in Russian Doll – or a different location could have made it more
  exciting. There’s nothing tremendously exciting or distinctive about One More
  Shot – but on the other hand, how many films have you seen featuring
  time-travelling tequila? It’s pleasantly derivative. One More Shot is
  screening around Victoria as part of Melbourne international film festival –
  see here for dates. The film will later be available to stream on Stan.
