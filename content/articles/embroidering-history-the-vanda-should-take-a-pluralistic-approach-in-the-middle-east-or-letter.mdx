  Embroidering history: the V&A should take a pluralistic approach in the Middle
  East | Letter

  We were interested to see your gallery of pictures from the exhibition Thread
  Memory: Embroidery from Palestine at V&amp;A Dundee (‘A symbol of Palestinian
  presence and identity’: the personal and political world of ‘tatreez’ – in
  pictures, 18 August), having visited the partner exhibit at V&amp;A South
  Kensington. The tatreez embroidery tradition should indeed be celebrated, but
  as scholars we are concerned by the failure to use historically correct
  language, and to recognise the diversity of cultures that existed in the area
  presented here simply as “Palestine”. Formally speaking, there was no such
  place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when several of these objects
  were produced. The showcase is situated within a larger gallery devoted to the
  “Islamic Middle East”: a framework that erases the historic presence of
  Christians and Jews in the region. The V&amp;A possesses interesting Jewish
  textiles from Iraq, but alas there is no space for them in the section
  dedicated here to “Ottoman embroidery”. Context is everything in museums
  nowadays. A pluralistic approach is essential to reflect regional complexity
  and acknowledge alternative narratives. Abigail Green Professor of modern
  European history, University of Oxford Michal Friedlander Berlin
