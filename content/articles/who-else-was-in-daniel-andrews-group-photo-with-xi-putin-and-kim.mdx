  A number of world leaders gathered in Beijing at a second world war
  commemoration parade on Wednesday, in a display designed to show off China’s
  military strength and geopolitical might. The presence of leaders such as
  Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un at the event has led to some
  western political and economic analysts describing it as a meeting of the
  “axis of upheaval”. After the parade, Russian state agency Sputnik released a
  group photo, featuring some expected – and unexpected – faces. Here’s who’s
  who. From bottom left: 1: Prabowo Subianto, the president of Indonesia.
  Prabowo travelled to China amid fierce protests at home over perks for
  lawmakers. Critics say the former general is overseeing a quiet creep of the
  military into civilian affairs, echoing the country’s authoritarian past. 2:
  Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation. Putin has hailed
  Russia’s “unprecedentedly” high level of ties with China, with booming trade
  between the two countries an economic lifeline for Moscow since the start of
  the war in Ukraine. 3: Xi Jinping, the president of China. Before the parade,
  Xi hosted dozens of leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in
  Tianjin this week, in a push to elevate groups dominated by the global south
  over EU and US-led groups such as Nato. 4: Peng Liyuan, the first lady of
  China. 5: Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of North Korea. Kim’s attendance at
  the military parade is only his second reported trip abroad in six years, and
  the first time he has been seen with Xi and Putin at the same event. 6:
  Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the president of Kazakhstan. In 2022 Tokayev said he
  had personally ordered security forces and the army to “open fire with lethal
  force” against protesters demonstrating against corruption and inequality. 7:
  Zahra Pezeshkian, the Iranian president’s daughter. Pezeshkian formerly worked
  as a chemist in the petrochemical industry and often travels with her widower
  father. 8: Masoud Pezeshkian, the president of Iran. Elected on a
  comparatively moderate platform on issues including women and minority group
  rights, Pezeshkian has presided over the escalation of the Iran-Israel war and
  increasing tensions with the US. 9: Serdar Berdymukhamedov, the president of
  Turkmenistan. The son of former autocrat leader Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has
  pledged to maintain his father’s neutral status in international affairs. One
  of the world’s most tightly controlled countries, Turkmenistan is heavily
  reliant on resource exports to China and Russia. 10: Ilham Aliyev, the
  president of Azerbaijan. Last month Aliyev signed a deal with Armenia at the
  White House to end the two countries’ four-decade conflict, which included the
  creation of a transit corridor named the “Trump Route for International Peace
  and Prosperity”. 11: Mehriban Aliyeva, the vice-president and first lady of
  Azerbaijan. Western observers say the Aliyev regime has imprisoned
  journalists, committed human rights abuses and allowed looting of state assets
  by public officials. 12: Alparslan Bayraktar, the Turkish energy and natural
  resources minister. 13: Li Junhua, the UN undersecretary general for economic
  and social affairs. 14: Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign affairs minister. In
  a meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan earlier in the week, Xi
  said China and Turkey should strengthen cooperation in the area of
  counter-terrorism, according to Chinese state media. 15: Dana Nǎstase, the
  former first lady of Romania. Nǎstase and her husband were sentenced to prison
  in 2014 on charges relating to blackmailing Romanian officials to receive
  various goods from China. 16: Celso Amorim, the chief foreign policy adviser
  to the Brazilian president. As foreign affairs minister in Luiz Inácio Lula da
  Silva’s first administration, Amorim pushed for a peace deal between the US
  and Iran. 17: Adrian Nǎstase, the former prime minister of Romania. Despite
  his later imprisonment, Năstase’s tenure is regarded by some observers as
  paving the way for Romania’s entry into Nato and the EU. 18: Marcos Galvão.
  Brazil’s ambassador to China was previously foreign affairs minister and
  ambassador to the EU. 19: Viorica Dǎncilǎ, the former prime minister of
  Romania. Elected in 2018, she was the first woman to hold the position. 20:
  Haszaimi Bol Hassan, the commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. The small
  south-east Asian country sparked an outcry when it announced in 2019 sodomy,
  adultery and rape would be punished with death, including by stoning. 21:
  Daniel Andrews, the former premier of Victoria. Andrews made headlines when he
  signed the state up for China’s Belt and Road development initiative in 2018 –
  a move that was vetoed by the then Morrison government. Andrews now runs a
  consulting firm and is patron of Labor Friends of Israel. 22: Laureano Facundo
  Ortega Murillo. The son of Nicaragua’s authoritarian leader, Daniel Ortega,
  leads his country’s relations with China, Russia and Iran. Human Rights Watch
  has described the Ortega regime’s brutal crackdown on opponents as turning
  Nicaragua into “the western hemisphere’s equivalent of North Korea”. The full
  shot of the group contains even more leaders – including the former New
  Zealand prime ministers John Key and Helen Clark, as well as the leaders of
  Malaysia, Belarus, Myanmar’s military junta, Cambodia, Cuba, Slovakia,
  Vietnam, Zimbabwe and several others.
