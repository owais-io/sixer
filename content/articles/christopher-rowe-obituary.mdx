  My father, Christopher Rowe, who has died aged 81, was a classical scholar
  specialising in the philosophy of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. He completed
  his final work, a translation into English of his edition in Greek of
  Aristotle’s Eudemian Ethics, after being diagnosed as terminally ill with a
  glioblastoma in September 2024. The edition appeared in 2023, and the
  translation of it will be published in September 2025. Christopher’s skills as
  a linguist, translator and philosopher enabled him to make celebrated
  contributions in this centuries-old field of study, which he believed had
  resonance in the modern age. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, in their different
  ways, argued that philosophical thinking is necessary if we are to live a
  successful, happy life. Capitalists, the privileged, or people of whatever
  sort will have nothing of what they really want until they ask the simple
  question: “What is it all for?” It was this thinking that guided Christopher
  in his studies, his politics and his personal relationships. Born in the town
  of March, Cambridgeshire, to Mary (nee Ashford), and Daniel, both teachers,
  Christopher was the second of six children, all of whom remained in close
  contact throughout his life. Christopher attended Christ’s Hospital school and
  then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1962. There he met Heather Knight,
  a fellow classicist from Girton College, whom he married in 1965. She was a
  critic, supporter, sounding board and cheerleader for Christopher throughout
  his life. In 1966 he joined Bristol University, where he was later appointed
  HO Wills professor of Greek. In the 1980s he was a founder member of the
  International Plato Society. In 1992, Christopher was invited to Madison,
  Wisconsin, where he began working with Terry Penner, whom he regarded as “the
  most important philosophical influence” on his life. In 1995, Christopher
  became professor of Greek at Durham University, where he had a Leverhulme
  research professorship. His colleagues speak widely of his steadfast support
  of younger academics, and he would travel to places as diverse as Georgia,
  Brazil, South Korea and Japan in order to do so. Christopher and Heather loved
  to travel, often with friends they had made from around the world, and, for
  the last 50 years, regularly visited Puglia, in Italy, where his brother
  lives. Moving to Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, in 2019 to be nearer to my
  sister, Sarah, and her family, they were regarded warmly by all, from
  neighbours to cafe owners and stall holders. Family was Christopher’s
  overwhelming priority. He felt his greatest achievements were his children and
  his grandchildren, and people speak as much about his humility, generosity and
  kindness as his scholarly achievements. Perhaps he succeeded in living the
  “good life” Aristotle wrote about. Christopher is survived by Heather, Sarah
  and me, his grandchildren, Sadie, Micky and Mia, and his siblings.
