  No one in their right mind thinks accommodating asylum seekers in hotels is a
  good idea. No one in their right mind thinks we should just live with
  undocumented, life-threatening migration routes into the UK. And no one in
  their right mind thinks the experiences endured by most migrants could be a
  rational choice for anyone. Forget for a moment the ludicrous, inflammatory
  posturing of many who should know better; we ought to be able to begin from
  these shared acknowledgments. Using hotels for housing vulnerable migrants is
  the equivalent of what prison reform campaigners have long called warehousing
  – make sure a problematic group is simply corralled somewhere more or less
  secure, and hope their issues will somehow sort themselves out. The chaos and
  under-resourcing of the legal processes involved and the shocking levels of
  delay mean that the conditions are created for maximal insecurity and
  rootlessness – at worst, resentment and criminality. And we have to face the
  fact that, so long as safe and legal routes for asylum seekers are inadequate,
  we are colluding in the flourishing industry of lethal and illegal systems
  whose effect is to create communities for whose safety and integration
  government is unable to plan, and who are trapped in a situation both
  dehumanising for them and challenging for localities where they are placed.
  Not a new issue: I have vivid memories of meetings more than 25 years ago in
  the post-industrial town in south Wales where I then worked, trying to broker
  discussion between local groups from socially deprived areas and various
  community and religious organisations, in the wake of what came across as a
  casual announcement from the government of a new initiative to settle
  significant numbers of asylum seekers in the town. Anger and bewilderment,
  yes, and an element of real hostility – but also a plaintive sense that yet
  again local voices had been completely ignored in a way that was all too
  familiar. But here’s the point of contact. We have become used to the
  insidious language of the “migrant crisis” as a matter of the interests of
  “ordinary people” over a consolidated mass of threatening, predatory,
  incomprehensible strangers – typically the young, foreign (and usually
  minority ethnic) male. The horrors of Southport last year, which had nothing
  to do with the immigration system, instantly produced a reinforcement of this
  perception that has grown stronger and stronger. But the truth is that the
  migrant, too, is an ordinary person. Anyone who has spent time with refugees –
  in Ukraine, in Syria, in Sudan, in Kent or Swansea – knows the conversations
  that are likely to happen. I never thought I could find myself here. I only
  want to make sure my children are safe. I miss my garden. I don’t know where
  my parents are. I don’t know how I can continue my education. To speak as
  though these people are anything other than ordinary is to reinforce the
  violence they have already experienced, the refusal to see them humanly.
  People in hotels, hostels, detention centres, are not there as a lifestyle
  choice – which is why it is not only unjust but absurd to punish them for
  being there. And to threaten such people as a way of pressurising the
  government to do something different is simple blackmail. Collective blame and
  indiscriminate violence are always the beginning of real moral corruption. A
  lot more work needs to be done to make audible the voices of actual
  individuals in the system, a lot more listening to the ordinariness of what
  they want and what they are afraid of. And at the moment, thanks to the
  rhetoric of both the nationalist right and some voices in or near government,
  what causes most fear among settled and newly arrived migrants is that they
  are assumed without argument to be criminal, morally alien, actively hostile
  to the communities around them. Can we stop talking about such people as not
  ordinary? Can we stop assuming that “ordinary people” are on one side of a
  zero-sum war? Much has been written about the failure of government and others
  to produce a counter-narrative around migration. But this needs to be not only
  a matter of generalisations about the benefits of diversity or whatever, but a
  story about the kind of vulnerabilities that people in the streets in the UK
  can identify with – something that amplifies the voice of the ordinary migrant
  and helps it to be recognisable. And this is most effective when grounded in
  local, face-to-face encounters, not only “official” exhortation. As with so
  many issues, facilitating proper deliberative and reflective opportunities
  within local communities is an urgent priority – perhaps the only thing that
  just might be able to challenge the standoff between the ordinary and the
  alien, and help each to recognise in the other some of the shared experience
  of being silenced and vulnerable. Still, the real counter-narrative issues
  goes deeper. The flags running up all around us are supposed to declare a
  pride in our identity and heritage. But what is it that we are proud of? What
  is it that we are defending? It is always moving when you hear, say, a student
  from a refugee background tearfully proclaiming their debt to Britain and
  their abiding loyalty to a country that has given them what they hardly dared
  hope for. We have good reason to be proud in the face of this. Internment
  camps, Ice-style snatch squads, payments to homicidal regimes for receiving
  returned migrants – none of this adds up to much in the way of “values”. It is
  natural and proper to be loyal to your neighbours and your history. But if
  this loyalty is no more than a sullen self-congratulation for just being where
  you are, it is not a project in which it is possible to take much pride. If we
  listen a bit harder to some of our migrant voices, we might be clearer about
  what others think we might have cause to be proud of. And we might start some
  proper cross-party conversation about what an immigration regime might look
  like that was committed to the safety and dignity of all the “ordinary” people
  involved in it. Rowan Williams is a former archbishop of Canterbury
