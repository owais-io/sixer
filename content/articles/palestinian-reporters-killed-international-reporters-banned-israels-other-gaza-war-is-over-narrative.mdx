  Gaza war is over narrative

  Israel is running two Gaza campaigns: one for military control of the strip;
  another for narrative control of how the world understands what happens there.
  In theory, Palestinian journalists and social media influencers documenting
  starvation, mass killing and other Israeli war crimes in Gaza are protected
  civilians under international law. But those paper protections have meant
  little on the ground in Gaza, by far the most dangerous place in the world to
  be a reporter, where more than 180 Palestinian journalists were killed in 22
  months of war, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Even though
  it is illegal to target journalists, the CPJ said that over the same period 26
  reporters were victims of targeted killings, which it described as murders.
  The most recent was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif,
  killed on Sunday in his makeshift newsroom outside a hospital, along with four
  colleagues. Press freedom groups and journalists say those killings are part
  of a campaign of intimidation to shut down vital reporting, which Israel has
  justified internationally with smears and false claims that the targets were
  undercover Hamas fighters. With international reporters barred from
  independent reporting in Gaza – a handful have been allowed in under Israeli
  military escort, but they are not allowed to move freely or speak to
  Palestinians – the work done by journalists in Gaza is critical. “I have no
  doubt that the prevention of international access, the killings of
  journalists, the targeting of media facilities, the punishment of [Israeli]
  outlets like Haaretz is part of a deliberate strategy on the part of Israel to
  conceal what is happening inside Gaza,” said the CPJ chief executive, Jodie
  Ginsberg. She pointed to a recent incident when a BBC crew reported from a
  Jordanian military plane dropping humanitarian aid into Gaza – but was barred
  by Israel from filming the devastation below. “We had the example of the
  international news crews being allowed to film the airdrops but not the
  devastation when the doors opened.” In July, Sharif, one of the most prominent
  journalists still working in Gaza, went viral on social media when he broke
  down on air covering starvation. Passersby urged him to keep going because he
  gave Gaza a voice. Soon after, an Israeli military spokesperson revived
  allegations – first aired in 2024 – that he was a militant, including accusing
  him of faking mass hunger in a “false Hamas campaign on starvation”. The CPJ
  issued a stark warning that those Israeli claims were a death threat. “These
  latest unfounded accusations represent an effort to manufacture consent to
  kill Sharif,” CPJ regional director Sara Qudah said at the time. “This is not
  the first time Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the
  danger to his life is now acute.” Sharif had also anticipated his own death
  and described it as retaliation for his reporting in a statement released on
  social media. “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in
  killing me and silencing my voice,” he wrote. Israel has published a dossier
  of documents it says were recovered from Gaza and link Sharif to Hamas. They
  end in 2021, two years before the war began, and do not even attempt to
  address his regular appearances live on camera. A role as one of the most
  prominent journalists in one of the most closely surveilled places on Earth
  would be strikingly difficult to combine with command of a Hamas unit during
  an all-out war. Documents Israel published after killing another Al Jazeera
  journalist last year claimed Ismail al-Ghoul was given a military rank when he
  was 10 years old. While they marshalled contradictory and unconvincing
  evidence, the existence of those files reflected Israeli concerns about
  pressure from western allies, and the need for at least the appearance of
  compliance with international law. Despite international pressure, Israel has
  not offered any explanation for the deaths of Sharif’s four colleagues,
  protected civilians killed in their workplace. Ginsberg said she feared that
  was a warning that already unimaginable risks had escalated further. “What’s
  astonishing to me is they’ve not even attempted to justify the other
  killings,” she said. “So they’re admitting to murdering those journalists,
  knowing they were journalists. “I think this is deliberately intended to have
  a chilling effect to show that Israel can do what it likes, and nobody will
  take any action. “If we are now at a stage where Israel can so brazenly target
  an entire news crew, what does that mean for the safety of any of the other
  journalists who are operating there. Who is next?” French historian
  Jean-Pierre Filiu, given rare permission to enter Gaza for academic research
  during the conflict, said a month researching there had also convinced him
  that Israel is trying to silence reporting from Gaza. “Now I understand why
  Israel is denying the international press access to such an appalling scene,”
  he said in an interview with Haaretz after the trip. “Even though I have been
  in a number of war zones in the past, from Ukraine to Afghanistan, via Syria,
  Iraq and Somalia, I have never, but never, experienced anything like this.”
