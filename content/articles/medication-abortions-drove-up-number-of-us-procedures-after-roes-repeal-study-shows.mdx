  study shows

  An abortion provider shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US
  residents between July 2023 and August 2024 – nearly 100,000 of whom lived in
  states that outlaw the procedure or have laws on the books that ban the
  mailing of abortion pills, according to a new study published in the
  prestigious medical journal Jama on Monday. To the shock of experts, the
  number of abortions performed in the US rose in the three years since the US
  supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for more than a dozen
  states to ban virtually all abortions. Much of that rise has been driven by
  the use of abortion pills, or medication abortion, and providers’ ability to
  supply the pills through telehealth. US abortion providers performed 1.14m
  abortions in 2024 – the highest number on record in recent years, according to
  data from #WeCount, a Society of Family Planning project. By the end of the
  year, #WeCount found, a full quarter of all abortions were being facilitated
  through telehealth. This study, which was led by a University of Texas at
  Austin professor and studied shipments from the telemedicine abortion service
  Aid Access, more fully fleshes out the portrait of US abortion access, as it
  is the first to examine abortion pill provision at the county level. The
  poorer a county was, the more likely its residents were to order abortion
  pills, researchers discovered. Counties where the poverty rates hovered
  between 10% and 20% had provision rates that were 1.63 times higher than
  counties where the poverty rate was lower than 5%. In counties where the
  poverty rate was above 20%, the provision rate was 1.93 times higher than in
  richer counties. Abortion pill provision rates were also more than three times
  higher in states that ban abortion compared with those that do not. In states
  that specifically ban telemedicine abortion, the provision rates were more
  than twice as high. Counties that were located farther from abortion clinics
  were also likely to see higher rates of abortion provision. Aid Access ships
  to all 50 US states through the use of “shield laws”, which have been adopted
  by a handful of blue states in the years since the repeal of Roe. These laws
  aim to guard abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions; if an abortion
  provider living in a state with a shield law ships pills across state lines,
  they are in theory protected from liability. But these laws have yet to be
  tested in court. Late last year, Texas sued a New York doctor over allegations
  that she had mailed abortion pills to a Texas woman. After the doctor,
  Margaret Carpenter, failed to show up for a court date, a judge ruled against
  her by default and ordered her pay a fine of more than $100,000. Citing New
  York’s shield law, a New York state clerk has repeatedly refused to enforce
  the fine. The Texas attorney general, Republican Ken Paxton, sued the clerk in
  July. Experts widely expect that the dispute, which tests the relationships
  between states that ban abortion and those that protect it, will eventually
  reach the US supreme court.
