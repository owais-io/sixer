  The Rugby Football League has been asked to produce an action plan detailing
  how it will comply with Sport England’s Code for Sports Governance, with
  critical funding for the sport due to be released next month remaining in the
  balance. Sport England has threatened to withhold the next instalment of a
  £16m funding package as a result of concerns over the RFL’s governance. During
  a turbulent few months for the RFL the chair, Simon Johnson, and several other
  directors have resigned from the board and that was followed by the
  controversial return of the former chief executive Nigel Wood, initially as
  interim chair and now as senior executive director. Sport England has concerns
  about whether the process which led to Wood’s return complied with the
  governance code and, during a meeting on Tuesday with the RFL, demanded
  assurances that the league will do so in future. The RFL has also been asked
  to produce a detailed timeline for the departures of Wood and the rest of a
  new interim board, who were put in place last month. An open recruitment
  process for new board members is planned for next March. In a statement, Sport
  England confirmed it had held talks with Wood and the RFL chief executive,
  Tony Sutton, and had outlined what steps must be taken next to remain
  compliant. It said: “Sport England hosted a constructive meeting with the RFL
  yesterday, at which the organisation’s leadership confirmed its commitment to
  good governance and compliance with the Code for Sports Governance. “As
  required by Sport England, the RFL is currently producing a Governance Action
  Plan which sets out steps the organisation will take to become compliant with
  the code, including a timeline for appointments to replace the interim board.
  “The RFL understands the importance of adhering to the code in exchange for
  public funding, and we look forward to reviewing its action plan in due
  course.” However, the Guardian understands that it remains possible Sport
  England could still choose against releasing the next six-figure payment due
  next month should the RFL’s action be deemed unsatisfactory. Wood returned to
  the board in March, initially as interim chair in a move the RFL stressed was
  temporary before clubs ratified his position as senior executive director last
  month. He has also been appointed as chair of Rugby League Commercial, the arm
  of the sport that looks after broadcasting and sponsorship deals.
