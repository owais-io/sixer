  Donald Trump said arrangements were under way for a face to face meeting
  between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral
  meeting between the two and the US president. Writing on his Truth Social site
  after meetings with Ukraine’s president and European leaders ended at the
  White House on Monday, Trump said: “I called President Putin, and began the
  arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President
  Putin and President Zelenskyy.” He added: “After that meeting takes place, we
  will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself. Again,
  this was a very good, early step for a War that has been going on for almost
  four years.” The US president also said after talks with leaders from the UK,
  Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the EU and Nato that Europe could provide
  security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a Russia peace deal, with
  Washington taking an oversight role. “During the meeting we discussed Security
  Guarantees for Ukraine, which Guarantees would be provided by the various
  European Countries, with a coordination with the United States of America,”
  Trump said on Truth Social. Here are the key Trump news of the day: Trump
  tells Zelenskyy ceasefire not needed for peace deal Donald Trump has ruled out
  a ceasefire in Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies visited
  the White House to push for US-backed security guarantees as part of any
  long-term peace deal. The US president, who only last week warned Russia of
  “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a halt the
  fighting, made clear on Monday he had reversed his position. Welcoming
  Zelenskyy to the hastily assembled meeting at the Oval Office, Trump referred
  to other conflicts which he claimed to have ended, telling reporters: “I don’t
  think you’d need a ceasefire. If you look at the six deals that I settled this
  year, they were all at war – I didn’t do any ceasefires.” Read the full story
  Trump says lawyers are drafting executive order to end mail-in voting Donald
  Trump on Monday announced that lawyers are drafting an executive order to
  eliminate mail-in voting, days after Vladimir Putin told him US elections were
  rigged because of postal ballots. In a White House meeting alongside Ukrainian
  president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said: “We’re going to start with an
  executive order that’s being written right now by the best lawyers in the
  country to end mail in ballots because they’re corrupt.” Read the full story
  Democrats return to Texas as California kicks off push to pass new electoral
  map Texas Democrats returned to their state on Monday as California lawmakers
  are set to convene in the state capitol to kick off a rapid push to get voters
  to approve a new congressional map that could add as many as five Democratic
  seats in the US House. The California effort is in response to Texas’s push to
  redraw the congressional map there to add five Republican seats. On Friday,
  Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, called a second special session
  after Democrats remained out of the state for two weeks, denying Republicans a
  quorum to conduct legislative business. Read the full story Newsmax to pay
  $67m to Dominion to settle US election defamation lawsuit The conservative
  outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67m to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a
  defamation lawsuit over lies about voting in the 2020 election. Read the full
  story What else happened today: The number of people eating at restaurants in
  Washington DC has plummeted since Donald Trump deployed federal troops to the
  city, according to data, as the president’s purported crackdown on crime
  continues. A federal judge in Miami was hearing arguments on Monday that
  detainees at the remote immigration jail in the Florida Everglades known as
  “Alligator Alcatraz” are routinely subjected to human rights abuses and denied
  due process before being deported. As part of his administration’s war on
  “woke”, Donald Trump has asked the American public to report anything
  “negative” about Americans in US national parks. But the public has largely
  refused to support a worldview without inconvenient historical facts, comments
  submitted from national parks and seen by the Guardian show. Catching up?
  Here’s what happened on 17 August 2025.
