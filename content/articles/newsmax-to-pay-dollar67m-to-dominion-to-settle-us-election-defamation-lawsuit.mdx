  The conservative outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67m to Dominion Voting
  Systems to settle a defamation lawsuit over lies about voting in the 2020
  election. The settlement came as the case was headed to trial. Earlier this
  year, Delaware superior court judge Eric Davis ruled that Newsmax had defamed
  the voting technology company by broadcasting false claims about its equipment
  after the 2020 election. A jury would have considered whether Newsmax was
  liable for damages. Dominion had sued the outlet for $1.6bn. After the 2020
  election, lies about the security of Dominion voting machines, which are
  widely used in the US, became central to Donald Trump’s false claim that the
  election was stolen from him. Allies and other rightwing personalities made
  baseless claims that votes had been flipped and that the equipment was not
  secure. “We are pleased to have settled this matter,” Dominion said in a
  statement to CNN. In a lengthy statement of its own, Newsmax was defiant,
  saying it chose to settle not because it was admitting wrongdoing, but because
  it believed Davis would not give the company a fair trial. “Newsmax believed
  it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the
  election disputes that arose in 2020,” the company said. “We stand by our
  coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of
  journalism.” Newsmax will be paying the settlement in three instalments until
  January 2027. Dominion obtained a $787.5m defamation settlement from Fox in
  2023 on the eve of a defamation trial in Delaware. Ahead of the settlement,
  Dominion lawyers obtained internal communications from Fox hosts and
  personalities that showed they knew many of the outlandish claims the outlets
  hosts and guests were broadcasting about the election were not true. Newsmax
  agreed to pay $40m to settle a defamation case against Smartmatic, another
  voting equipment company, last year. One America News, another far-right
  outlet, also settled a defamation case with Smartmatic last year. Fox is now
  defending itself in a pending defamation suit brought by Smartmatic.
