  Faustus in Africa! review – William Kentridge’s devilishly clever twist on
  damnation

  As told by Goethe and Marlowe, the story of Faust is of one man’s journey into
  temptation. Having explored the outer limits of human knowledge, this
  renaissance man can go no further. Unless, that is, he signs a pact with the
  devil. In exchange for his soul, Mephistopheles gives him all the earthly
  pleasure and intellectual satisfaction he desires. But sins have consequences
  and in this ambitious show by William Kentridge for South Africa’s Handspring
  Puppet Company, a reworking of a 1995 production, Faustus does not take this
  journey towards damnation alone: the world comes with him. Now, his list of
  job titles extends to missionary and enslaver, and his travels across the
  African continent lead to war, exploitation and environmental catastrophe. If
  there were an eighth deadly sin, it would be that of colonialism. It is a
  fertile idea, one that allows Kentridge to present a parable about western
  hubris. In a rhyming translation by the late Robert David Macdonald, he shows
  the damaging legacy of the quest for wealth, power and resources, its impact
  not just a historical blip but a lasting wound. In a clever twist, Faustus
  escapes damnation because a corrupted continent has become dependent on his
  venal ways and cannot afford to lose him. It is as if the whole of Africa is a
  victim of Stockholm syndrome. Set in an early-20th-century library where a
  manual telephone exchange connects calls from a disembodied devil, Faustus in
  Africa! tells much of its story through Kentridge’s scratchy black-and-white
  animations projected at the back of the stage. Maps chart Faustus’s progress
  across the land, where a bloodthirsty safari destroys not only elk, warthogs
  and buffalo, but also the statues of great thinkers, leaving “the wound of a
  slashed future”. Half-size human puppets by Adrian Kohler and Basil Jones rise
  up from behind the bookshelves, meeting skeletal animals, a shadow-puppet
  military parade and the occasional grisly fate. Only Mephistopheles takes
  human form (a suave Wessel Pretorius in “corrective shoes” to hide his devil’s
  hoof). Operated by two puppeteers, Faustus is square-jawed and gaunt, an
  unreflecting figure, indifferent to his impact. For all that it looks
  striking, static exchanges between inanimate puppets sap some of the energy
  from an enterprising production. • At the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 23
  August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
