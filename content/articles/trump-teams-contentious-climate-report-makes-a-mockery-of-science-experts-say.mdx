  A group of the US’s leading climate scientists have compiled a withering
  review of a controversial Trump administration report that downplays the risks
  of the climate crisis, finding that the document is biased, riddled with
  errors and fails basic scientific credibility. More than 85 climate experts
  have contributed to a comprehensive 434-page report that excoriates a US
  Department of Energy (DOE) document written by five hand-picked fringe
  researchers that argues that global heating and its resulting consequences
  have been overstated. The Trump administration report, released in July,
  contains “pervasive problems with misrepresentation and selective citation of
  the scientific literature, cherry-picking of data, and faulty or absent
  statistics”, states the new analysis, which is written in the style of the
  authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. “This
  report makes a mockery of science,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist
  at Texas A&amp;M University. “It relies on ideas that were rejected long ago,
  supported by misrepresentations of the body of scientific knowledge, omissions
  of important facts, arm waving, anecdotes and confirmation bias. This report
  makes it clear DOE has no interest in engaging with the scientific community.”
  Another reviewing academic, Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, an environmental
  scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he was “shocked and
  appalled” by the “total disgrace” of the Donald Trump report and was willing
  to join with other volunteer researchers from leading institutions to correct
  the record. The review will be submitted as part of a public comment period on
  the report, which closes on Tuesday. Chris Wright, the US energy secretary,
  has said the report pushes back against the “cancel culture Orwellian
  squelching of science” and that the five authors were not ordered what to
  write. However, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have condemned
  the “farce” of the exercise, pointing out it has been used to justify the
  administration’s rollback of climate regulations, rather than act as
  legitimate scientific inquiry. “Setting aside several weeks of time to join
  dozens of other scientists in an effort to correct the cherry-picked data in a
  US government report wasn’t on my bingo card this summer,” said Andra Garner,
  a climate scientist at Rowan University. “But it is clearly what the situation
  required.” Reached for comment, DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said: “Unlike
  previous administrations, the Trump administration is committed to engaging in
  a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and
  energy.” The four main critiques contained in the climate scientists’ review
  are: Authors The problems with the new DOE assessment began when the agency
  hand-picked five climate contrarians to author it, the analysis says. They
  include John Christy, an atmospheric scientist who has said the climate crisis
  could be positive; Judith Curry, a climatologist who rails against climate
  “alarmism”; Steven E Koonin, a physicist who has called climate science
  “unsettled”; Ross McKitrick, an economist who has said the climate crisis is
  not a “big issue”; and Roy Spencer, a meteorologist and climate scientist who
  has said top scientists overblow the impact society has on the climate. In the
  DOE report, Wright says the authors were chosen “for their rigor, honesty, and
  willingness to elevate the debate”. But each one is “well known for
  manufacturing uncertainty”, the new review states. By selecting these authors,
  the Trump administration appears to be violating a 1972 law requiring balanced
  perspectives within executive advisory committees, the new review says.
  “[T]his group appears to have been personally recruited by the Secretary of
  Energy to advance a particular viewpoint favored by DOE leadership,” the
  analysis says. Peer review and transparency Federal advisory committee members
  are subject to transparency laws aimed at promoting citizen input and
  accountability, the analysis notes, but the group’s convenings happened in
  secret, and their work was withheld from the public. Under Office of
  Management and Budget rules, such assessments are also meant to be subject to
  peer review. But no such review has yet occurred, the authors note. “When it
  became clear that DOE wasn’t going to organize such a review, the scientific
  community came together on its own, in less than a month, to provide it,” said
  Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who has said the DOE
  report misrepresented his research. The working group’s process also violated
  the stated aims of the Trump administration, they say. In a May executive
  order, the president said only peer-reviewed science that is conducted in a
  conflict-free and transparent manner should underpin policies. “We should be
  using scientifically vetted and properly reviewed assessments to make legal
  decisions – not unreviewed documents that present a distorted view of our
  scientific knowledge,” said Abigail Swann, a professor of atmospheric sciences
  and ecology at the University of Washington. Asked about these concerns,
  Dietderich said the DOE report was “reviewed internally by a group of DOE
  scientific researchers and policy experts from the Office of Science and
  National Labs” and is now “opened to wider peer review from the scientific
  community and general public via the public comment period”. Cherry-picked
  evidence The Trump administration report selectively reviews scientific
  literature and plucks small sections to support its arguments, rather than
  present a full picture of the evidence, the scientists’ review states. For
  example, the Trump-appointed researchers point to the extreme heat of the
  1930s Dust Bowl, while ignoring what was going on in the rest of the world and
  how this compares to global trends today. Other “cherry-picked” evidence is
  used to support claims about the role of the strength of the sun in raising
  Earth temperatures and the sensitivity of the climate to carbon emissions, the
  review finds. Another section, in which the report looks at climate-driven
  extreme events, is badly mischaracterized, according to Dessler. “I mean, they
  just don’t understand what they’re talking about,” he said. “Five people were
  hand-selected by the secretary of energy for their viewpoints, and they
  produced a shoddy mess of cherry-picked data and unsupported assertions,” said
  Pamela McElwee, associate professor of human ecology at Rutgers University.
  While the DOE report was written in four months, traditional federal and
  international climate reports – such as the US national climate assessments
  and IPCC reports – are each authored by hundreds of experts, the new analysis
  says, “with multiple rounds of internal and external review”. Because the DOE
  report “covers areas in which the authors are not experts”, their report is
  riddled with “errors in the report caused by a lack of familiarity with the
  science”, the assessment says. About 11% of the DOE report’s citations were
  written by its own five authors – a share nearly five times higher than the
  average rate at which authors’ own work was cited in a 2023 IPCC report that
  230 experts wrote. Predetermined outcome The Department of Energy report was
  released as part of a Trump administration push to repeal the “endangerment
  finding” – a landmark 2009 determination that greenhouse gases harm human
  health. The elimination of this finding by the Environmental Protection Agency
  would effectively kneecap all US policies designed to cut planet-heating
  pollution from cars, trucks and power plants. The DOE report is intended to
  provide cover for this political goal rather than act as a credible work of
  science, the review found. Dietderich said the president “values the role of
  science” and that the administration “have not pre-judged how this report will
  impact EPA’s proposed Endangerment Finding rulemaking or any policy or program
  at the Department of Energy”. Yet by sidelining credible climate scientists
  and actively promoting the report’s conclusions in draft form, the Trump
  administration has shown that this work is merely a tool in service of a
  political goal, the reviewing scientists added. “Work contrary to the
  conclusions of the DOE report is dismissed or simply ignored, making it clear
  that the report is intended to support a specific policy decision and is not
  an unbiased synthesis of climate science,” said Christopher Callahan, a
  climate scientist at Indiana University.
