  The boss of HSBC has joined a growing chorus of bankers cautioning Rachel
  Reeves against increasing taxes on banks in her autumn budget, warning it
  risked “eroding” investment and ultimately harming UK growth. Georges
  Elhedery, its chief executive, said banks in the UK were already subject to
  the highest level of taxes on profits compared with other sectors, and paid
  more than in most other countries. He said placing further financial pressures
  on lenders could spell trouble for the UK economy. “Additional taxation on
  banks does run the risk of eroding our continued investment capacity in the
  business and in supporting our customers, and ultimately in delivering growth
  for the UK,” he said on Wednesday, as the bank revealed a 29% drop in
  second-quarter profits. The intervention comes amid growing speculation that
  Reeves could use her autumn budget to announce a fresh round of tax rises, as
  forecasts for public finances worsen. While UK banks have so far dodged an
  increase in sector-specific levies, a leaked memo by the deputy prime
  minister, Angela Rayner, in May urged the chancellor to consider a series of
  wealth taxes, including increasing the corporation tax rate on banks. Banks
  currently face the 25% headline rate of corporate tax, as well as a 3% bank
  surcharge and a further bank levy, which is a charge on a portion of balance
  sheet assets. Estimates by the lobby group UK Finance and the accountancy firm
  PwC suggest that, when also accounting for employment taxes and VAT, banks in
  the UK are paying a total tax rate of about 45.8%. That compares with 38.6% in
  Frankfurt and 27.9% in New York. Elhedery’s comments come days after the chief
  executive of Lloyds Banking Group, Charlie Nunn, warned that higher taxes on
  the banking sector could damage Labour’s plan to see the City drive an
  economic recovery, and “wouldn’t be consistent” with the chancellor’s
  messaging to date, as the government pushes to reboot growth. Financial
  services were among the eight sectors that received government banking in the
  Labour government’s industrial strategy, with the chancellor subsequently
  announcing a number of changes to slash regulation and increase growth across
  the sector. However, Elhedery said HSBC was “positive about the outlook” for
  the UK, which had “demonstrated strong resilience over the last few years”. He
  said: “We continue to see strong resilience across credit outlook indicators
  and obviously across matters such as employment, the reduction of inflation,
  all of which give us significant room to be more optimistic about the
  outlook.” Elhedery also highlighted the “pace” at which the UK had struck a
  number of free trade agreements, including with the US, EU and India.
  “Frankly, UK-India is one of our most vibrant corridors, and we’re really
  looking forward to supporting our clients [to] realise the full benefits of
  this FTA.” However, his comments came as HSBC revealed a worse-than-expected
  drop in profits between April and June as its exposure to a struggling Chinese
  bank and Hong Kong’s troubled commercial real estate sector took its toll. The
  London-headquartered bank, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, said
  it took a $2.1bn (£1.6bn) paper loss related to its stake in China’s fifth
  largest lender, Bank of Communications (BoCom). The investment was diluted by
  a recapitalisation plan meant to offset the effects of a sluggish Chinese
  economy and struggling property sector. It is the second charge the bank has
  taken over BoCom, with the ripple effects of China’s property downturn
  resulting in a $3.1bn hit last year. HSBC also took a $400m charge related to
  “challenging market conditions” in Hong Kong’s commercial real estate sector,
  as the bank tried to cushion the blow of potential defaults across the
  industry, with “the oversupply of nonresidential properties putting continued
  downward pressure on rental and capital values”. Together, the impairment
  charges pushed down HSBC’s pre-tax profits 29% to $6.3bn in the three months
  to the end of June, compared with £8.9bn during the same quarter last year.
  However, the bank still announced further payouts to shareholders, as it
  focused on the strength of the bank outside the one-off hits that dragged down
  earnings. That includes a dividend of 10 cents a share and a share buyback of
  up to $3bn, which is expected to take place before the time it announces
  third-quarter results at the end of October.
