  Israel’s foreign minister has revoked the visas of Australian representatives
  to the Palestinian Authority, citing Australia’s “unjustified refusal” to
  grant visas to Israeli figures and its intention to recognise Palestinian
  statehood. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar said the decision was
  made following the Albanese government’s cancellation of Simcha Rothman’s visa
  on Monday ahead of his speaking tour this month. “While antisemitism is raging
  in Australia, including manifestations of violence against Jews and Jewish
  institutions, the Australian government is choosing to fuel it by false
  accusations, as if the visit of Israeli figures will disrupt public order and
  harm Australia’s Muslim population,” Sa’r said. “It is shameful and
  unacceptable!” The foreign minister said he had also instructed the Israeli
  embassy in Canberra to “carefully examine any official Australian visa
  application for entry to Israel”. His opposite number, Penny Wong, said on
  Tuesday morning the Israeli decision was “unjustified”. “At a time when
  dialogue and diplomacy are needed more than ever, the Netanyahu government is
  isolating Israel and undermining international efforts towards peace and a
  two-state solution,” Wong said in a statement. “This is an unjustified
  reaction, following Australia’s decision to recognise Palestine.” She said
  Australia will continue to work with partners to contribute to “international
  momentum to a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza and release of the
  hostages”. “Australia welcomes different races, religions and views, united by
  respect for each other’s humanity and for each other’s right to live in
  peace,” she said. The Australian government will always take decisive action
  against antisemitism, she said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The prime
  minister, Anthony Albanese, announced Australia would recognise a Palestinian
  state at the United Nations general assembly in September as part of a
  two-state solution, following new commitments by the Palestinian Authority.
  The move was criticised by Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as
  “disappointing” and “shameful”. Australia’s representatives to Palestine are
  based in Ramallah in the West Bank. Palestine’s foreign ministry condemned
  Israel’s decision to revoke the visas of Australian representatives in the
  “strongest terms”, describing the move as “illegal” and a display of “Israeli
  arrogance and a state of political imbalance”. Rothman, a member of the
  Religious Zionism party which is part of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, had
  been scheduled to appear at events in Sydney and Melbourne next weekend as
  part of a “solidarity tour” for Jewish Australians. The far-right politician,
  who is strongly opposed to a two-state solution, once described Palestinian
  children in Gaza as “enemies” and called for Israel’s full annexation of the
  West Bank. The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, confirmed on Monday that
  Rothman’s visa application had been cancelled after Guardian Australia first
  put questions to his office on Friday morning. “Our government takes a hard
  line on people who seek to come to our country and spread division,” Burke
  said in a statement. “If you are coming to Australia to spread a message of
  hate and division, we don’t want you here. Under our government, Australia
  will be a country where everyone can be safe, and feel safe.” Burke has
  previously barred the entry of other personalities and politicians with a
  history of controversial or offensive statements, including the rapper Kanye
  West, the US law professor Khaled Beydoun and the former Israeli minister
  Ayelet Shaked. Rothman accused the Albanese government of “clear and blatant
  antisemitism” in a post written in Hebrew on X shortly after the decision was
  made public. Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of Rothman’s party who was
  sanctioned by the Albanese government in June, praised Rothman, saying “in the
  face of all the antisemites in the world, the people of Israel stand behind
  you and support you”. Israel’s diaspora minister, Amichai Chikli, said
  Australia’s decision reflected a “broken moral compass, discrimination, and a
  grave assault on free speech”, while Israel’s former opposition leader, Benny
  Gantz, said it was “not only deeply misguided, but blatantly hypocritical”.
  “If only Australia fought the ravaging antisemitism targeting its Jewish
  communities with the same fervor it banned representatives from the one &amp;
  only democracy in the Middle East,” Gantz said in a post on X. Rothman is an
  outspoken critic of a two-state solution and has supported Donald Trump’s
  proposal to remove Palestinians entirely from Gaza, citing security concerns
  for Israel. In a May interview with the UK’s Channel 4, he claimed children
  within Gaza were “enemies” who should not be allowed to flee into Israel as
  “you don’t let them conquer your country with refugees”. “They are our enemies
  and according to international treaties about refugees in the time of war, you
  don’t let them conquer your country with refugees,” Rothman said. In July,
  Rothman was one of a handful of Knesset members who initiated a symbolic
  motion to “apply” Israel’s sovereignty to the occupied West Bank territory.
  The motion passed 71-13. The Israeli embassy in Australia has been contacted
  for comment.
