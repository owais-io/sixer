  “If you are reading this, I have just become a mother.” That was the first
  sentence I ever wrote for this column series, three-and-a-half years ago, the
  starting pistol on a clutch of copy filed in advance before my son arrived
  suddenly, explosively, five weeks early. I was supposed to have a break for a
  few weeks while those pieces ran, but I found I couldn’t: I was making notes
  before I left the hospital. Looking back, I can see that there are a few
  things I got wrong in those few years. I never pretended to be an expert, and
  tried to be upfront about the fact that I was very much learning on the job.
  So here is a potted list of things I regret: I was wrong to be so dismissive
  of baby-led weaning. I had anxiety from a difficult birth and my son being
  hospitalised, and I was neurotic about choking. My son was preterm and wasn’t
  ready to be handling big bits of food at six months, but I didn’t realise that
  at the time (still, I maintain that people are weird and culty about it).
  Also, I was wrong to make a joke about “tummy time” not mattering: tummy time
  matters, especially for kids with certain disabilities. And I was wrong,
  possibly, or at least inconsiderate, to write about how having a baby had made
  Christmas feel so special. A woman who had just had a miscarriage sent me a
  message saying it had made her cry, and I think, were I to write that column
  again, I would try to better acknowledge the pain of those with infertility
  and baby loss – the subject of my column the following Christmas. Still, there
  is a lot I stand by. I still think two weeks of statutory paternity leave is
  pathetic and embarrassing. I still don’t think dads can have it all, either. I
  still don’t think there is a quick fix to baby sleep. I still think
  breastfeeding promotion policy in this country is a disaster, which sidelines
  maternal mental health and doesn’t even work in the process. And I still
  passionately hate Bill Thompson, from Postman Pat – the snarky little sod with
  an attitude problem whose voice continues to grate on me even as my son
  giggles with delight at his antics (although his favourite character is
  Michael). If there’s one lesson I’ve learned in the last three years of being
  a mother – and of writing about it – it’s that all of my readers were right:
  those first days, weeks and months really do pass so quickly, and though they
  can be hard, a part of you will long for them. Had I not written it down, I am
  sure there is so much I would have forgotten. In that sense, it’s been a gift.
  I’ll never get to hold my son as a baby again, or to hear the little truffle
  pig grunts as he sought me out for milk, but the writing of an experience
  helps to hold it in time, can even transport you back. Readers, too: I have
  been so moved by how many of you said you were in the trenches with me, or
  those, older, who said my writing helped conjure that time for them. It’s a
  funny thing, being a columnist. I picture my readers all the time, mainly
  because I hear from so many of you (your messages, emails and comments below
  the line have been the best part of this job), but it didn’t occur to me that
  you might picture me. The reality three-and-a-half years ago wasn’t pretty: I
  was newly postpartum, reeling, sleep-deprived. Often I wrote while “the bairn”
  screamed in the other room, cared for by my husband, or my mother – both of
  them are the hidden labour behind this column. For some reason, I had been
  arrogant enough to think writing with a newborn would be easy. Of all the
  things I have got wrong as a writer, that was probably the main one. There was
  this look I used to get in the run-up, when I told friends and family who were
  already parents that I was planning to document it all, in real time, and
  report on others’ experiences, too. It was a kind of wordless, smiling nod,
  the sort you also often get when you say that you want a water birth with no
  pain relief, or that you and your partner are solid and that a baby won’t
  change that. It’s often followed by a hesitant sentence before the person
  trails off. Just you wait, the knackered goblin in their head is hissing, but
  they’re too nice to say anything, and so they don’t. So that was my first
  error. In a way, I’m glad I made it, because otherwise I would not have
  written, and despite the fact that any time a female writer produces anything
  at all about motherhood she’s accused of thinking she’s the first woman in the
  world to have ever had a baby, when you look at the history of humanity we are
  still very much in the early days of women writing about this. We forget that
  for many centuries we weren’t even taught to write. Our knowledge was passed
  between us, and passed down, through the words that we spoke to one another,
  and to our daughters. I started this column because very little of the writing
  that existed then – brilliant as it is – seemed to speak to parents of my
  generation and younger, who face unique challenges. Now, there is far more,
  and it feels as though with every year that passes our voices are being taken
  more seriously. Choosing columns from this series to stitch together into a
  book was an emotional process. The thread that runs through them all is the
  feeling that, when it comes to parenting, having a feeling of community and
  solidarity are paramount. So it’s my story, but you have all been a part of
  it, too, from the many, many readers who have sent encouragement and advice,
  to the grandfather who said that he dances with his baby granddaughter now
  because he won’t live to see her wedding. Even the dad who said you don’t need
  to do anything with your kids until their teens, whereupon you can simply take
  them white-water rafting, taught me something. So many of you have been a part
  of this journey. Thank you for coming on it with me. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is
