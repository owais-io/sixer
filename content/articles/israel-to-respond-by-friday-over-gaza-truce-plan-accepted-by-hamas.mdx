  Israel has said it will deliver its response to international mediators by
  Friday over a new Gaza ceasefire plan accepted by Hamas amid mounting pressure
  for a truce in a war that has claimed more than 62,000 Palestinian lives.
  After mass protests in Israel demanding a deal to secure the release of the
  remaining 20 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza, it appeared that Hamas had
  reduced its demands over a prisoners-for-hostages exchange as well as over the
  scope of an Israeli-demanded “security buffer zone”. Under reported details of
  the proposed plan, about half of the remaining living hostages, as well as
  bodies, would be released in a phased deal in exchange for about 150
  Palestinians held in Israeli jails, some serving life sentences, during an
  envisaged 60-day ceasefire. While Israel has said it is no longer interested
  in a partial deal, instead threatening an imminent new large-scale offensive
  to capture Gaza City, the details of the new ceasefire proposal bring it very
  close to the outline of a deal initially suggested by Donald Trump’s special
  envoy Steve Witkoff. The head of the Mossad, David Barnea, has recently
  visited Qatar amid speculation that talks are more active than officially
  acknowledged by Israel. Israeli officials have briefed that Benjamin Netanyahu
  will convene talks on the proposal in the next few days. A senior Israeli
  official told AFP the government’s stance had not changed and demanded the
  release of all hostages in any deal. Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson
  said on Tuesday that the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Hamas was
  “almost identical” to an earlier plan put forward by Witkoff. Hamas had given
  a “very positive response, and it truly was almost identical to what the
  Israeli side had previously agreed to”, the spokesperson said. Egypt said on
  Monday that it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel and “the ball is
  now in its court”. Reports emerged on Tuesday that Egyptian security officials
  were putting strong pressure on Hamas to agree to a compromise that would
  bridge the gap for Israel’s demands for Gaza’s demilitarisation in any future
  peace deal by placing Hamas’s weapons in Egyptian custody for an undisclosed
  period. With Hamas’s agreement, the focus will now be on Israel, which is
  under mounting international pressure to accept a ceasefire amid international
  horror over widespread conditions of starvation that have spread through the
  Palestinian territory after Israel earlier this year imposed a complete
  blockade on aid entering Gaza. While Israel is now letting some supplies into
  the Gaza Strip, it is not enough to avert widespread starvation, the UN human
  rights office said on Tuesday. Its spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan told a
  press briefing in Geneva: “In the past few weeks Israeli authorities have only
  allowed aid to enter in quantities that remain far below what would be
  required to avert widespread starvation.” He said the risk of starvation in
  Gaza was a “direct result of the Israeli government’s policy of blocking
  humanitarian aid”. Israel’s military agency that coordinates aid, Cogat, has
  said Israel invests “considerable efforts” in aid distribution to Gaza, a
  claim rejected by many in the international community. While any prospect of a
  ceasefire is rejected by Netanyahu’s far-right allies who have again suggested
  they could collapse his fragile governing coalition, the scale of mass
  protests in favour of a deal that would secure the return of Israeli hostages
  is creating its own dynamic, with more demonstrations being called for this
  weekend. On Tuesday, Israeli media analysts suggested that a vacillating
  Netanyahu, whose position has lurched abruptly between supporting a partial
  deal for a ceasefire and rejecting it, would be compelled to choose a course
  of action, not least if the White House backs the ceasefire terms. “Just two
  weeks ago he changed his tune and went from insisting on a partial deal to
  vehemently demanding a comprehensive deal,” wrote Amos Harel in Haaretz of
  Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations
  of war crimes in Gaza. “As usual, everything is fluid and flexible: Netanyahu
  will change his arguments and explanations, and may even covertly encourage
  internal opposition, as long as he can afford to avoid signing a deal. “If
  circumstances become impossible for him, due either to a demand from Trump or
  persistent and severe public outcry, the deal will be signed despite the risks
  it poses for him.” Facing a full resumption of his trial on corruption charges
  in the autumn, the most significant of those risks is that Netanyahu’s
  government falls and he is compelled to call new elections. Writing in the
  centre-right Yedioth Ahronoth, Ben-Dror Yemini was equally scathing about
  Netanyahu’s leadership and the consequences of rejection of the new proposal.
  “What now? If Israel says no, it will walk into the trap that Hamas prepared.
  Because if the talk – and it’s only talk – about conquering Gaza City has
  already begun to produce increasing calls for sanctions [against Israel], then
  a military incursion into Gaza will only precipitate an even stronger
  avalanche,” he wrote. “We have to bear in mind that things can always get
  worse. And if an Israeli incursion into Gaza City, along with all of the
  horrific images of destruction, devastation and fatalities, is going to
  precipitate this avalanche, then going into Gaza City after Hamas said yes to
  the Witkoff plan – and after Israel refused – will only worsen the avalanche.
  Once again, Hamas’s strategy will be proven as far more intelligent than
  Israel’s.”
