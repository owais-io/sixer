  ceding land in return for peace

  Good morning. On Friday, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Alaska to
  discuss the future of Ukraine, but there was no deal reached and no big
  questions answered. Trump appeared deferential to the Russian leader and now
  backs plans to hand over Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal. Today he
  will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. In discussions about
  what a peace settlement would look like, “land swaps” were represented as
  simple transactions. The fate of people appeared to be a casual afterthought.
  Trump and Putin are eager to embrace the idea that territory can be bought and
  sold like real estate, but Guardian reporting exposes the devastating part of
  this war: human loss. Last month casualties hit a three-year high, with more
  Ukrainian civilians killed than in any month since May 2022. Our writers have
  been documenting the escalating human cost of this war – whole communities
  eradicated, schools shut, cottages silent and people in towns near fighting
  exhausted by sleepless nights. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to our senior
  international correspondent Luke Harding, who has just returned from four
  weeks in Ukraine, about what morale is like in these once tranquil villages
  now on the frontlines – and whether the Alaska summit changes anything for
  Ukraine. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Gaza | Palestinians were
  gripped by fear and anxiety on Sunday after the Israeli military said it was
  preparing for the forcible displacement of a million people from Gaza City.
  Meanwhile tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in Tel Aviv to call for
  an end to the war in Gaza. Scotland | The UK’s first transgender judge has
  launched a case against the UK in the European court of human rights
  challenging the process that led to the supreme court’s ruling on biological
  sex. Business | The bosses of Britain’s largest listed companies took home
  record high pay packets for the third successive year, according to a report.
  Analysis found that the record set in the last financial year means the
  average FTSE 100 chief executive is now paid 122 times the salary of the
  average full-time UK worker. US news | Three people were killed and eight
  others wounded when multiple gunmen opened fire inside a crowded Brooklyn
  hookah lounge and restaurant early on Sunday morning, according to
  authorities. Weather | Hurricane Erin was downgraded to category 3 early on
  Sunday as its outer bands continued to lash the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
  with heavy rains and tropical storm force winds. In depth: ‘Entire communities
  are being eradicated’ Luke Harding has been reporting from the Dnipropetrovsk
  region, which the Russians have penetrated for the first time in the last few
  weeks. An evacuation charity has been rescuing elderly and sick people from
  frontline villages swallowed up by fighting – they are usually the last to
  leave. “It’s about people, it’s about homes, livelihoods, families, husbands,
  wives, children, grandparents, dogs, cats, chickens, vegetable gardens, and so
  on – this is what’s being lost,” says Luke. “Entire communities are being
  eradicated.” This monumental loss is encapsulated by the story of Valentyn
  Velykyi, a 70-year-old man who lived in the small agricultural village of
  Maliyivka in central-eastern Ukraine. He knew everyone in his village. Once
  Russian troops arrived, the village’s 300-odd residents fled, except Velykyi –
  until a missile destroyed his house and he no longer had a home to go to.
  People in villages all over Ukraine have similar stories. “There’s something
  biblical about it,” says Luke. “You go to these places and you see
  incongruously blooming vigorous gardens with flowers and marrows and apple
  trees where apples are falling and lying on the wayside, next to benches where
  people used to sit and gossip with their neighbours.” Primary schools are
  closed, shops are shut up, and people have fled. “It’s the extermination of a
  way of life – that’s what it is. It’s not real estate. It’s human estate.”
  Luke says Putin is indifferent to what happens in these areas – his priority
  is for them to be part of Russia. For many civilians in areas under occupation
  by Russia, ceding control in a peace deal would mean saying goodbye to their
  homes for ever. As a foreign correspondent, Luke would go to the frontline and
  then return to Kyiv to write his reports, but now Kyiv is being targeted by
  Russian drones almost every night. “It’s really hard to sleep, and when you go
  out for your coffee in the morning, everybody looks exhausted.” *** What do
  ordinary Ukrainians think about Russia? A poll from 2014 found that 26% of
  Ukrainians living in the east of the country thought Russia and Ukraine should
  unite as a single state. But Luke says that now – apart from a very few older
  people – everybody supports Ukraine and hates Russia. Since the war, Ukraine
  has also become more European (last month protests erupted against weakening
  the powers of anti-corruption agencies). “The great irony of this war is that
  Putin wants to de-Ukrainise Ukraine – he wants to make it disappear, roll it
  back into Russia.” But he’s done the opposite, says Luke, who has been
  travelling to Ukraine since 2007. “Ukraine has become more Ukrainian since
  I’ve been going there.” Shaun Walker, meanwhile, has been reporting from the
  city of Zaporizhzhia, an industrial hub in south-east Ukraine that has been
  under near-constant attack from missiles and drones. Plenty of people here and
  in other Ukrainian towns close to the frontline are ready for Kyiv to sign a
  peace deal – even an imperfect one – if it means the attacks will stop. But
  many others disagree, because they know first-hand what it means to give
  Russia control over Ukrainian territory: arrests, disappearances and the
  erasure of anything Ukrainian. *** What does the future hold for Ukrainians?
  Today European leaders will join Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in
  the White House for a meeting with Donald Trump in an effort to push back on a
  US-endorsed “peace plan”. Ukrainians understand Russia very well. They speak
  both languages, and they don’t trust Putin, who has “violated every previous
  agreement he’s signed”, says Luke. Giving over land, they believe, would
  simply make it easier for him to advance further. “People understand that a
  ceasefire would last five minutes, five days, maybe a maximum of five months,
  and then Putin would continue because his goal is unchanged – which is to
  destroy Ukraine entirely and turn it into Russia, which he considers it to
  be,” says Luke. “And practically the only person on the planet who doesn’t
  seem to understand this is Donald Trump.” The Russian strategy is to be
  deliberately chaotic – targeting different areas all across the country.
  Fighting has increased on all fronts, with waves of kamikaze drones and
  ballistic missiles. “It looks pretty bleak insofar as the Russians will
  continue to push forward. They have numerical advantages in terms of troops,
  machinery, fibre-optic drones,” he says. “I just don’t see that ending,
  because the Russians think they’re winning … There’s no incentive for the
  Russians to stop, and the Americans are not making the Russians stop. “Putin’s
  lobbying campaign on Trump behind the scenes has been extremely effective.
  Trump has basically shifted position in a way that Ukraine and Europe hoped he
  wouldn’t. This has happened in two important ways: one, he now says there
  needs to be a comprehensive peace deal and then a ceasefire [which is the
  Russian position]; and two, sources suggest he has embraced the Russian land
  swap plan, which is that Russia gets full control of Donetsk and Luhansk as a
  condition for ending the war. “What we’ll see over the next few weeks is
  pressure ratcheted up on Ukraine to go along with this ‘ceasefire plan’
  without very many meaningful guarantees from America,” says Luke. “It’s going
  to be a stormy and difficult time ahead. And what is abundantly clear – post
  Alaska – is that this war will continue.” *** What about the fate of
  Ukrainians elsewhere? There are nearly seven million Ukrainian refugees
  globally, with more than 200,000 in the UK. Generally, refugees have been
  treated well – support for Ukraine is not a party-political issue in the UK.
  But there have been issues with continued housing – for example, last weekend
  a Ukrainian mum with two children told Luke she was being kicked out of her
  council flat. “Many people opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees three and
  a half years ago, and now many have had to move on,” he says. Some have gone
  back to Ukraine. A billion-pound budget was awarded to councils across England
  to help Ukrainian refugees find accommodation. Yet £327m has remained unused,
  despite thousands of Ukrainian refugees being homeless. “It’s fine to say,
  ‘Oh, we’re saving it for a rainy day,’ but people are struggling now,” says
  reporter Diane Taylor, who worked on the investigation, published this
  morning. While organisations such as the Ukrainian Institute London have
  offered free language classes, learning English remains a barrier for many
  refugees seeking accommodation, especially when trying to access private
  rented housing. Diane stressed how “if you can speak the language, it makes
  life easier, even for something as unimportant as a holiday”. Experts,
  meanwhile, say council support “is often a postcode lottery”. Councils have a
  great deal of discretion over the funds, and while many have received
  assistance, more and more are struggling. The problem for Ukraine is that the
  longer the war goes on, the less likely people are to return. “Mostly we’re
  talking about women and kids,” says Luke. “The ones in the UK are in British
  schools, they’ve made friends – they’re integrating. The longer the war
  continues, the greater the likelihood they become British.” Ukrainians are
  weary but defiant. “They want the fighting to stop, they want the bombs to
  stop falling. But they don’t want to hand over their homes, communities, jobs,
  the places where they fell in love, to the Russian enemy.” Additional writing
