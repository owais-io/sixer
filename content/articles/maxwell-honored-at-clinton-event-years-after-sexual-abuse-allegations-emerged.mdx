  Ghislaine Maxwell was honored by the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) in 2013,
  four years after sexual abuse accusations against her emerged – and two years
  after the former president Bill Clinton’s staff recommended banning her from
  official events, CNN has reported. Maxwell – who in 2022 was sentenced to 20
  years in prison for sex trafficking and related crimes – attended the CGI
  conference as a guest of merit, where she was applauded for her work on ocean
  conservation alongside other “Commitment to Action” leaders, according to the
  network. Maxwell’s complimentary access to the conference indicated that her
  invitation was personally recommended by either Bill or Hillary Clinton, the
  former first lady, secretary of state and US senator, the outlet said. That is
  because a top Clinton aide, Doug Band, had instructed CGI staff to “remove
  Ghislaine, from all lists” for Clinton-related events, as CNN put it. The
  conference invite came four years after Jeffrey Epstein’s accuser Virginia
  Roberts Giuffre claimed in a 2009 lawsuit against Epstein that Maxwell had
  recruited and groomed her for – as well as participated in – her sexual abuse.
  And the claims had already surfaced in press reports. In that same year,
  Maxwell was hit with a subpoena to testify in that suit as she was leaving a
  CGI event – and a year later attended the 2010 wedding of Chelsea Clinton. A
  representative for Clinton said more than 600 complimentary tickets were
  approved for the CGI conference in 2013. “The decisions on those comps were
  made, as they have been historically, at the staff level, which included the
  office of President Clinton,” they said. A spokesperson for the former
  president said that Maxwell’s appearance at the event “is about someone
  working on ocean conservation attending a charitable conference 12 years ago,
  along with thousands of other people, and nothing more”. “As we have
  consistently said, the Clintons know nothing about Jeffrey Epstein’s terrible
  crimes,” the spokesperson added. But the report will add to questions about
  the Clinton family’s continued association with Maxwell even after she was
  accused of involvement in Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation. In an interview
  with the deputy attorney general posted online by the Trump justice department
  on Friday, Maxwell said Bill Clinton never went to Epstein’s island – and
  described his trips on Epstein’s plane as connected to humanitarian projects.
  Flight logs record that Clinton travelled on Epstein’s plane 26 times but
  Maxwell characterized it as “one journey” – and said he had never received a
  massage. “So they spent time on the plane together, and I don’t believe there
  was ever a massage on the plane,” she said. “So that would’ve been the only
  time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage.
  And he didn’t, because I was there.” Maxwell’s attendance at the 2013 event
  hints at stress over Maxwell’s continued presence in the Clintons’ orbit after
  the allegations against her surfaced. Band, the Clinton aide, told Vanity Fair
  that Chelsea Clinton remained friends with Maxwell because “Ghislaine had
  access to yachts and nice homes. Chelsea needed that.” A Clinton spokesperson
  told CNN: “If Doug Band instructed anyone to bar Maxwell, he didn’t
  communicate it broadly and didn’t say why.” Sunday’s report about Maxwell and
  the 2013 CGI conference came as Donald Trump’s administration has been
  struggling to contain a bipartisan uproar surrounding the White House’s
  unfulfilled promises to release all of the federal government’s records on
  Epstein, who was friends with Trump before a falling out before Epstein’s 2019
  death.
