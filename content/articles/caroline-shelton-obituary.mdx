  My friend and former colleague Caroline Shelton, who has died aged 67 of
  cancer, was a tutor in trade union studies and a trade union activist, with a
  special interest in health and safety. Having been a shop steward while
  working in the computing sector, in the early 1990s she became a lecturer in
  trade union studies at Lewisham College in London. She was elected as health
  and safety officer of her Unite union branch in 2018 and nominated to join me
  and other colleagues on the board of the London Hazards Centre, which helps
  Londoners to assert their right to live and work in a safe, healthy
  environment. She was also a Unite delegate to the Kent and Medway Trades Union
  Congress, a Labour councillor in Gravesend, Kent, for a number of years, and a
  Labour delegate to Gravesend constituency Labour party. Caroline was born in
  Gravesend, and was raised in a trade union-supporting family. Her bookbinder
  mother, Joy (nee Mitchell), was a mother of chapel in the Sogat printing
  union, and her lorry-driver father, Gordon Shelton, was an enthusiastic member
  of the Transport and General Workers’ Union. In 1967, when Caroline was 11,
  the family moved to Wellington in New Zealand, where she attended Wellington
  East girls’ college before returning to Gravesend in 1972, after which her
  education continued at Wombwell Hall school in nearby Northfleet. She also
  attended the Royal College of Music on Saturdays before going on to study
  music at Goldsmiths College (now Goldsmiths, University of London). After
  graduating from there in 1980, Caroline began working as a peripatetic music
  teacher for the Inner London Education Authority, travelling around various
  schools, before deciding that computing offered her better prospects. A year
  studying computing at Bristol Polytechnic (now University of the West of
  England) followed, after which she worked for Bowater-Scott and Wellcome
  Dartford (later subsumed into GlaxoSmithKline) in Gravesend. There she was
  elected as the shop-steward of her MSF/Amicus trade union branch, as well as a
  delegate to the MSF/Amicus London regional council and its annual conferences.
  In 1992 she changed tack to become a lecturer at Lewisham College, teaching
  trade union studies there while also freelancing for the Workers’ Education
  Association and Ruskin College Oxford, South Thames College and CONEL in
  Tottenham. In 2011 she was elected as a Labour councillor in Gravesend.
  Caroline attended pickets and protests with her branch banner for as long as
  she could, and saw active trade union branches as being essential to
  challenging all social injustices and mitigating all work-related hazards.
  When ill health forced her to resign from our board in March, she was elected
  honorary president “in grateful appreciation for her many years’ service as a
  determined fighter for a safer London”. She is survived by her younger
  brother, Craig.
