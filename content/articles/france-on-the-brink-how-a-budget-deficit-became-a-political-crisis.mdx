  France is stuck in economic limbo, without a budget and soon, possibly,
  without a government. The prime minister, François Bayrou, has called for
  parliament to hold a confidence vote on 8 September and, now that parties of
  the left and far right have pledged to bring down the government, on paper he
  doesn’t have the numbers to win. On Tuesday, the Socialist party (PS) added
  its voice to the dissenters, allying it with the Greens and the far-right
  National Rally. In an effort to head off a no vote, the finance minister, Eric
  Lombard, has stated publicly that asking the global lender of last resort, the
  International Monetary Fund, to intervene “is a risk that is in front of us”.
  Without the Socialists, Bayrou’s centre-right administration cannot survive.
  And there is widespread agreement among economists that Bayrou’s fall will
  trigger further speculation about the health of the economy and the public
  finances. At first glance, France’s situation would appear to be far from
  dire. It is a pillar of the euro monetary system. The government’s debts are
  lower in relation to the size of the economy than those of Italy, and the cost
  of financing its annual debt interest bill is well below the UK’s. Yet while
  France’s debt to GDP ratio is lower than Italy’s 135%, Rome has a grip on its
  annual expenditure. Italy might suffer from low growth, but no lower than
  France’s, and the EU commission forecast is for an improvement next year. And
  for inflation to stay low. At the same time, the debt to GDP ratio is on
  course to fall from 3.3% this year to 2.9% in 2026, below the 3% stipulated by
  the commission. France, by contrast, is rapidly closing the gap with its
  neighbour after projections showed a persistent annual spending shortfall
  pushing the French debt to GDP ratio from 113% last year to more than 120% by
  the end of the decade. For international investors, it is less the size of the
  debt that matters than its trajectory. So while French debt interest costs are
  low, at 3.5% on 10-year bonds when the UK is coping with 4.7%, they are not as
  low as Italy’s. Even Greece outperforms France. According to European Central
  Bank data, Greece has a debt to GDP ratio of 158%, but pays only 3.36% on its
  10-year bonds. The president, Emmanuel Macron, has tried to persuade the
  French people that the public finances need some major surgery but to no
  avail. He has warned against complacency, saying the “years of abundance are
  over”. Probably his most unpopular act so far is to push through a rise in the
  retirement age from 62, saying that higher pensions payments are a drag on the
  state’s finances and deny the economy skilled workers. Bayrou’s minority
  government aims to go further. It plans to save almost €44bn (£38bn), to bring
  down the budget deficit from last year’s 5.8% of GDP to 4.6% in 2026. One of
  its more contentious proposals is the scrapping of two French public holidays.
  The only rescue plan available appears to be re-formulating the budget to
  bring the Socialist party on side, though months of wrangling have made that
  seem a distant prospect. Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies, said that
  despite a fall in the value of French banks on the stock market today, there
  were few repercussions from higher debt costs of political instability for the
  French financial sector, at least in the short term. He said the political
  crisis was more a threat to economic growth than the solvency of the
  government. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected Bayrou to temper his
  demand for a reduction in the annual deficit as a way to save his
  administration. However, a higher deficit “would imply a further increase in
  the debt-to-GDP ratio and put potential credit rating adjustments back in
  focus”. This would bring with it a boost for the economy because “a smaller
  deficit reduction into next year would imply a smaller fiscal drag and be
  positive for growth, all else equal”, they said. “But the tightening in
  financial conditions and increase in policy uncertainty would likely be
  negative for growth. Taken together, we think that growth would likely
  continue to run at 0.6% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026,” they added. These figures
  will make grim reading for Macron, who pledged to develop a more vibrant,
  high-growth economy. With French polls showing there are few plans around
  which a majority of French people are willing to coalesce, a budget could be a
  long way off.
