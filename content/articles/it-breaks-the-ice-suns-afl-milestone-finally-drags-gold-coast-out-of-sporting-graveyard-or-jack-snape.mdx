  Twelve hours after the Gold Coast Suns secured their first AFL finals berth,
  an unusual sight played out on the grounds at Palm Beach Currumbin State High
  School, just down the M1 from People First Stadium. The student-footballers in
  a programme that has produced more than 20 men’s and women’s AFL draftees were
  preparing for their club grand finals this weekend, and the coming climax to
  the Queensland schools competition. But, given what had happened the previous
  night, there was something that took precedence. So one student began the
  physically-taxing “bear walk”, surrounded by the rest of the group – most
  members of the Suns academy – applauding the Bombers fan struggling on his
  hands and feet. “One of our boys had a bet with our coach,” says Neil Mackay,
  the school’s head of sport. “He backed Essendon, and the bet was if you lose,
  you’ve got to do a hundred-metre bear walk.” The veteran teacher has spent 35
  years at the school, which has produced the likes of Dayne Beams and Sam
  Gilbert, and more recently emerging Suns’ stars Jed Walter and Will Graham.
  Like many on the Gold Coast, Mackay has witnessed more than his fair share of
  sporting misery. “The student was going for Essendon, so we made sure he paid
  up,” he says. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter Make
  no mistake, these are strange days in Australia’s sixth-largest urban centre.
  After 326 AFL games and 15 years, the Suns are finally due to play their first
  final, against Fremantle next Saturday. “Sport’s really strong on the Gold
  Coast, we just haven’t quite got the success model right at that national
  level,” Mackay says. “It breaks the ice.” At Gold Coast’s very own Sporting
  Hall of Fame, there have been 49 athletes inducted since the first –
  motorcyclist Mick Doohan, in 1999. Eight are swimmers, six are surfers and
  three are triathletes. There is not one AFL player. The absence is no
  surprise, given the difficulties the urban corridor known more for surfing and
  schoolies has had within Australia’s elite professional competitions. Before
  the Suns, the Brisbane Bears briefly played games at Carrara for six years
  before they moved to the Gabba, but in that time never made finals. In
  basketball, the NBL’s Gold Coast Cougars became the Rollers after two seasons
  in the 1990s, and were extinct after another five. A decade later, the Blaze
  flamed out after five of their own. The A-League’s Gold Coast United lasted
  just three, ending in another Clive Palmer bin fire. In rugby league, the
  struggles of the Titans – likely wooden spooners in 2025 – are hard to ignore,
  even if the club were brief top four contenders 15 years ago and have been one
  of the NRLW’s better performers in recent years. Before that, few forget the
  tragicomedy of the Chargers in the 1990s, and before them the Seagulls
  featuring a fading Wally Lewis. “I remember seeing The King’s long wheelbase
  maroon Mercedes Benz – Wally Lewis’s car – parked in the carpark as you walked
  in to watch the games,” says the chair of the Hall of Fame and junior state
  cricketer Jeff Pfaff. “His number plate was QLD-06 or something like that.”
  The Gold Coast resident of 53 years agrees it has been “tough” for the
  region’s professional teams, but argues his hometown is the “centre of the
  universe” in some sports, such as surfing, surf lifesaving and swimming.
  One-off events have also been a success, Pfaff argues, citing the popular Gold
  Coast marathon which attracted more than 50,000 to the region this year. The
  region also hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2018, and eight local venues will
  be used in the 2032 Olympics. “I’m not sure it’s a graveyard, but they’ve had
  some things that haven’t worked as well as they would like in the past. But I
  think with the right product and always the right outcomes and stuff like
  that, the Coast will get behind it,” he says. Working with the region’s next
  generation every day, Mackay believes that now the fundamentals are in place
  for Gold Coast to make its sporting mark. “It’s hard at that level, and we
  just haven’t quite got the recipe right, but now history is going to be a bit
  more on our side,” he says. “You’ve now got the population base to get the
  crowds and get the financial aspect of those franchises right.” Attendances at
  Suns matches have averaged close to 17,000 this season, and there was another
  strong crowd on Wednesday night to see the historic thumping of the Bombers.
  Afterwards, Suns coach Damien Hardwick said he has noticed more fans get
  behind his team as a final became more likely, even if his players did get a
  bit “tight” in fumbling two opportunities to secure their place in the past
  two weeks. “We are young and emerging if that makes sense, but we’re also
  young and emerging as a footy club,” he said. “I noticed that, walking around
  Burleigh, all of a sudden there’s a lot of Suns colours that are jumping up.”
  Mackay says it’s significant the team has “created history” this week, but
  it’s just one step along the path towards winning a flag, and other things
  might be slower to change. “It’s 27C, blue sky up here today. You’ve got the
  beach, or you can go to the footy,” Mackay says. “Well, you might find more
  now pick the footy.”
