  The Spanish football federation (RFEF) has confirmed the contract of its
  women’s team manager, Montse Tomé, will not be renewed when it expires at the
  end of August. The under-23 manager, Sonia Bermúdez, has been appointed to
  replace Tomé, with the former Spain international to be assisted by Iraia
  Iturregi in a new joint model. Tomé was appointed in 2023, the assistant
  manager taking over from Jorge Vilda, who was sacked after Spain’s first World
  Cup win. Long-held frustrations boiled over after the federation’s then
  president Luis Rubiales’s inappropriate actions during the medal ceremony,
  including kissing Jenni Hermoso. Tomé left Hermoso out of her first squad,
  citing a need to protect her, a decision the player criticised. She guided the
  team to the 2023-24 Nations League title and to the final of Women’s Euro
  2025, where they lost against England last month. The federation’s board
  thanked Tomé for “her work, professionalism and dedication in various roles
  during her time as a member of the national teams at the RFEF, especially
  during her time as the national team coach”. Bermúdez scored 35 goals in 63
  games for Spain and played for Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona, Western New York
  Flash, Atlético Madrid and Levante, winning nine league titles and three Copa
  de la Reina trophies. She coached the under-19 and under-20 women’s national
  teams, winning two consecutive European titles, before taking charge of the
  under-23 side. Iturregi played 15 seasons in the Spanish top flight, winning
  four league titles with Athletic Club. David Aznar has been appointed coach of
  Spain’s under-19 and under-20 sides and Milagros Martínez will be the under-17
  coach.
