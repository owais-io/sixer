  An Israeli security cabinet meeting, which had been expected to discuss
  Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for the “full occupation” of Gaza, has been
  postponed amid mounting tensions over whether the plan is feasible. Amid a
  stalling of ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israeli officials had briefed
  local and international media that the prime minister was considering an
  expansive offensive, aimed at taking full control of the Palestinian territory
  after 22 months of war against the militant group Hamas. At least 61,020
  Palestinian people have been killed and 150,671 others injured in Israeli
  attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a
  statement on Tuesday. At least 87 Palestinian people, including 52 aid
  seekers, were killed and 644 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the
  ministry said. The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah warned Tuesday that if Israel
  intensifies its military operations against his group, the Iran-backed armed
  faction will resume firing missiles toward Israel. Naim Kassem’s comments came
  as Lebanon’s Cabinet was meeting to discuss Hezbollah’s disarmament. The
  British consulate in Jerusalem has called for accountability for settler
  violence and the release of the body of Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian
  activist and journalist who was killed last week during an attack by Israeli
  settlers in the south Hebron hills. “We’re deeply saddened by the killing of
  Palestinian human rights defender Odeh Hathaleen,” the consulate posted on X
  on Tuesday. Truck drivers trying to deliver aid inside Gaza say their work has
  become increasingly dangerous in recent months as people have grown
  desperately hungry and violent gangs have filled a power vacuum left by the
  territory’s Hamas rulers. Crowds of hungry people routinely rip aid off the
  backs of moving trucks, the local drivers said. Some trucks are hijacked by
  armed men working for gangs who sell the aid in Gaza’s markets for exorbitant
  prices. More than 100 critically ill and injured children in Gaza hope to come
  to the UK as soon as possible after the government announced a scheme to
  provide those in severe need with NHS care. The British government announced
  on Sunday that it would evacuate children from Gaza to the UK for treatment
  under a scheme to be announced within weeks. Gaza’s civil defence agency said
  26 people were killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes on Tuesday, including
  14 who were waiting near an aid distribution site. Civil defence spokesperson
  Mahmud Bassal was told by the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that 8
  people were killed by Israeli gunfire while waiting for aid near the southern
  city of Khan Younis. The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children,
  Unicef, has said that 28 children have been killed on average every day in
  Gaza. “Death by bombardments. Death by malnutrition and starvation. Death by
  lack of aid and vital services,” Unicef wrote in the social media post,
  referring to the relentless deadly Israeli bombardments Palestinians are
  subjected to and the severe restrictions on aid that has caused famine
  conditions across the Strip. Gaza’s government media office has posted to
  Telegram to say that only 95 aid trucks entered the territory on Monday. The
  media office said most of the aid trucks were looted due to the “security
  chaos sowed” by Israel with the ultimate aim of undermining the “cohesion of
  society”. More than a dozen Democratic members of Congress have signed on to a
  letter that urges the Trump administration to recognise Palestinian statehood,
  in a draft copy shared with the Guardian. Congressman Ro Khanna of California
  is leading the letter addressed to the president and secretary of state Marco
  Rubio, and is joined by several House progressives, including Greg Casar of
  Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Maxwell Frost of Florida. Footage
  taken by the Guardian’s international correspondent, Lorenzo Tondo, shows the
  extent of the destruction of Gaza. The Guardian traveled on a Jordanian plane
  delivering aid as starvation worsens in the territory… The leader of Lebanon’s
  Hezbollah warned Tuesday that if Israel intensifies its military operations
  against his group, the Iran-backed armed faction will resume firing missiles
  toward Israel. Naim Kassem’s comments came as Lebanon’s Cabinet was meeting to
  discuss Hezbollah’s disarmament. Beirut is under US pressure to disarm the
  group that recently fought a 14-month war with Israel and was left gravely
  weakened, with many of its political and military leaders dead. Since the war
  ended in November with a US-brokered ceasefire, Hezbollah officials have said
  the group will not discuss its disarmament until Israel withdraws from five
  hills it controls inside Lebanon and stops almost daily airstrikes that have
  killed or wounded hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah members. Israel
  has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its military capabilities. Israel’s
  military has said the five locations in Lebanon provide vantage points or are
  located across from communities in northern Israel, where about 60,000
  Israelis were displaced during the war. Since the ceasefire, Hezbollah has
  claimed responsibility for one attack on a disputed area along the border. In
  a televised speech Tuesday, Kassem said Hezbollah rejects any timetable to
  hand over its weapons. “Israel’s interest is not to widen the aggression
  because if they expand, the resistance will defend, the army will defend and
  the people will defend,” Kassem said. “This defense will lead to the fall of
  missiles inside Israel.” Truck drivers trying to deliver aid inside Gaza say
  their work has become increasingly dangerous in recent months as people have
  grown desperately hungry and violent gangs have filled a power vacuum left by
  the territory’s Hamas rulers. Crowds of hungry people routinely rip aid off
  the backs of moving trucks, the local drivers said. Some trucks are hijacked
  by armed men working for gangs who sell the aid in Gaza’s markets for
  exorbitant prices. Israeli troops often shoot into the chaos, they said.
  Drivers have been killed in the mayhem, AP reported. Since March, when Israel
  ended a ceasefire in its war with Hamas and halted all imports, the situation
  has grown increasingly dire in the territory of some two million Palestinians.
  International experts are now warning of a “worst-case scenario of famine” in
  Gaza. Under heavy international pressure, Israel last week announced measures
  to let more aid into Gaza. Though aid groups say it’s still not enough,
  getting even that amount from the border crossings to the people who need it
  is difficult and extremely dangerous, the drivers said. The British consulate
  in Jerusalem has called for accountability for settler violence and the
  release of the body of Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist
  who was killed last week during an attack by Israeli settlers in the south
  Hebron hills. “We’re deeply saddened by the killing of Palestinian human
  rights defender Odeh Hathaleen,” the consulate posted on X on Tuesday. “We
  call for the immediate and unconditional release of his body so his family can
  hold a respectful funeral in Um Al Khair. There must be accountability for
  settler violence. Impunity must end.” On Monday, a video appeared to show an
  Israeli settler, Yinon Levi - who was sanctioned by US president Joe Biden,
  then removed from the sanctions list by Donald Trump - firing his gun wildly
  at residents of the village of Umm al-Khair at the time of the killing. Levi
  was arrested by Israeli police for questioning and was later released on house
  arrest, the Guardian previously reported. Hathaleen helped to make the
  Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, which depicted Palestinian life in
  the territory under Israeli rule. The killing comes amid an increasing wave of
  settler and Israel military violence against Palestinians in the occupied West
  Bank. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000
  injured in the West Bank since October 2023. A Palestinian boy drags
  containers of water amid shortages, at a distribution point in Deir al-Balah
  in the central Gaza Strip earlier today. Geneva Abdul is a reporter and
  feature writer for the Guardian who focuses on foreign policy and diplomatic
  affairs More than 100 critically ill and injured children in Gaza hope to come
  to the UK as soon as possible after the government announced a scheme to
  provide those in severe need with NHS care. The British government announced
  on Sunday that it would evacuate children from Gaza to the UK for treatment
  under a scheme to be announced within weeks. While campaigners welcomed the
  announcement, they urged ministers to move quickly, saying children awaiting
  urgent medical care in the UK had died waiting, or were forced to be medically
  evacuated to other countries. “We have previously had children on the list but
  because approval takes so long, some of those children have ended up dying,”
  said Omar Din, a co-founder of Project Pure Hope (PPH) and a healthcare
  executive in NHS primary care. “The government needs to move at pace.” You can
  read the full story here: Gaza’s civil defence agency said 26 people were
  killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes on Tuesday, including 14 who were
  waiting near an aid distribution site. Civil defence spokesperson Mahmud
  Bassal was told by the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that 8 people
  were killed by Israeli gunfire while waiting for aid near the southern city of
  Khan Younis. Six more people were killed and 21 injured by Israeli fire in
  central Gaza while waiting for food near a distribution centre, according to
  Bassal. The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, has said
  that 28 children have been killed on average every day in Gaza. “Death by
  bombardments. Death by malnutrition and starvation. Death by lack of aid and
  vital services,” Unicef wrote in the social media post, referring to the
  relentless deadly Israeli bombardments Palestinians are subjected to and the
  severe restrictions on aid that has caused famine conditions across the Strip.
  “Gaza’s children need food, water, medicine and protection. More than
  anything, they need a ceasefire, Now.” it added. An Israeli security cabinet
  meeting, which had been expected to discuss Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for the
  “full occupation” of Gaza, has been postponed amid mounting tensions over
  whether the plan is feasible. Amid a stalling of ceasefire negotiations with
  Hamas, Israeli officials had briefed local and international media that the
  prime minister was considering an expansive offensive, aimed at taking full
  control of the Palestinian territory after 22 months of war against the
  militant group Hamas. However, senior Israeli military officers and former
  senior commanders warned the plan would endanger the lives of the remaining
  Israeli hostages held by Hamas, risk further international isolation of Israel
  and require Israeli soldiers to administer a population in which Hamas
  fighters were still present. Any move towards full occupation is likely to be
  strongly resisted by large parts of the international community, already
  horrified by the conduct of Israel’s military campaign. Israel’s
  scorched-earth campaign has already obliterated large parts of Gaza, killing
  more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, forcing nearly all of Gaza’s more
  than 2 million people from their homes and causing what a global hunger
  monitor last week called an unfolding famine. That has caused widespread
  international anger and prompted several European countries to say they would
  recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire, amid
  mounting calls for sanctions against Israel. The disquiet follows briefings to
  Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had decided the expanded
  offensive was a foregone conclusion. “The die has been cast. We’re going for
  the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating Hamas,” the unnamed
  sources said, quoting Netanyahu. Gaza’s government media office has posted to
  Telegram to say that only 95 aid trucks entered the territory on Monday. The
  media office said most of the aid trucks were looted due to the “security
  chaos sowed” by Israel with the ultimate aim of undermining the “cohesion of
  society”. We remind you that the Strip needs no less than 600 relief and fuel
  trucks daily to meet the minimum health, food and service requirements, amidst
  a comprehensive collapse of the infrastructure and the ongoing war of
  genocide. We condemn the continued crime of systematic starvation, the closure
  of crossings and the prevention of the entry of aid, and we hold the
  occupation and its allies fully responsible for the worsening humanitarian
  disaster that affects more than 2.4 million people. We call on the
  international community and the Arab world to take effective action to
  permanently open the crossings, ensure the flow of food and medical aid, and
  baby formula in sufficient and safe quantities, and hold the occupation
  accountable for its crimes against civilians. Israeli officials have variously
  denied the existence of mass starvation, claimed without evidence that Hamas
  steals and hoards aid and blamed hunger on UN distribution failures. UN-backed
  food security experts said at the end of last month that a “worst-case
  scenario” famine was now unfolding in Gaza and called for an urgent ceasefire
  to alleviate “widespread starvation”. At least 61,020 Palestinian people have
  been killed and 150,671 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7
  October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. At
  least 87 Palestinian people, including 52 aid seekers, were killed and 644
  others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. In a post on
  Telegram, the health ministry wrote: A number of victims are still under the
  rubble and on the streets, as ambulances and civil defense crews are unable to
  reach them until now. Over the past 24 hours, hospitals in the Gaza Strip
  recorded 8 new deaths due to famine and malnutrition, including a child, the
  ministry added in the Telegram post. This brings the total number of
  Palestinian people who have died from famine and malnutrition to 188,
  including 94 children. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the
  newswires from Gaza: Reuters is reporting that Israeli tanks pushed into
  central Gaza this morning but it was not clear if the move was part of a
  larger ground assault. Palestinian people living in the last fifth of the
  territory Israel has not taken military control of – or put under evacuation
  orders – said any new move to occupy the area would be catastrophic. “If the
  tanks pushed through, where would we go, into the sea? This will be like a
  death sentence to the entire population,” Abu Jehad, a Gaza wood merchant,
  told Reuters. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says one of its
  volunteers in Khan Younis, Abdel Majeed Adnan Salamah, was killed by Israeli
  forces as he searched for food in Gaza. In a post on X, the PRCS wrote: Since
  the start of the war, Abdel Majeed worked tirelessly with PRCS ambulance
  teams, risking his life to rescue the wounded and injured. Two days ago, he
  left in search of food in the so-called the “US-Israeli aid zone” west of
  Rafah. There, Israeli forces targeted him – along with other starving
  civilians. He never made it back. Abdel Majeed was killed while simply trying
  to survive. Like all Gazans, our teams and volunteers are enduring severe
  hunger. Yet despite the exhaustion, they continue their life-saving work,
  committed to easing the suffering of others. Shrai Popat is a politics blogger
  for Guardian US More than a dozen Democratic members of Congress have signed
  on to a letter that urges the Trump administration to recognise Palestinian
  statehood, in a draft copy shared with the Guardian. Congressman Ro Khanna of
  California is leading the letter addressed to the president and secretary of
  state Marco Rubio, and is joined by several House progressives, including Greg
  Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Maxwell Frost of Florida.
  “This tragic moment has highlighted for the world the long overdue need to
  recognize Palestinian self-determination,” the letter reads. “Just as the
  lives of Palestinians must be immediately protected, so too must their rights
  as a people and nation urgently be acknowledged and upheld.” The letter comes
  as human rights experts sound the alarm over the unfolding famine in Gaza, and
  as some of Israel’s key western allies, including France and Canada, have
  recently pledged to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly.
  You can read the full story here: At least 74 Palestinian people were killed
  in Israeli attacks across Gaza yesterday, including 36 people seeking aid
  supplies, according to Al Jazeera, which cited medical sources in its
  reporting. We have not been able to independently verify this information yet.
  At least 1,400 people have been killed while seeking aid since 27 May 2025,
  most of whom were killed near US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)
  sites, while other Palestinian people were killed along the routes of aid
  convoys, the UN said on Friday. GHF aid sites replaced the traditional UN
  distribution mechanism in May after Israel accused Hamas of looting UN aid, a
  charge Hamas denies. Aid officials say little humanitarian assistance went
  astray during the short-lived ceasefire that came into effect in January.
  Critics have argued that the GHF is a tool for the Israeli and US governments
  to politicise humanitarian aid and to distribute it in ways that will
  depopulate sectors of Gaza in apparent violation of international law. US
  state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the US secretary of state,
  Marco Rubio, discussed the “humanitarian situation in Gaza” and ceasefire
  negotiations in calls with the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and French
  foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot yesterday. The Israeli government is
  reportedly exploring the idea of intensifying its military assault as
  ceasefire negotiations have stalled – which it blames on Hamas. The US and
  Israel withdrew their negotiators from Doha, Qatar’s capital, 11 days ago and
  said they would explore “alternative options” to retrieve the hostages. Israel
  has been widely accused of using food as a political weapon and of flagrantly
  breaking international law by collectively punishing the civilian population
  of Gaza by its aid blockade. Aid organisations were bringing somewhere between
  500 and 600 trucks a day into Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year, but
  now Israeli restrictions mean only a trickle of aid is being allowed into the
  territory (only 36 aid trucks entered on Saturday, for example, according to
  Gaza’s government media office). The Guardian’s chief Middle East
  correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, has broken down in great detail how
  Israel has deliberately caused a famine in Gaza. Here is an extract from her
  piece: The mathematics of famine are simple in Gaza. Palestinians cannot
  leave, war has ended farming and Israel has banned fishing, so practically
  every calorie its population eats must be brought in from outside. Israel
  knows how much food is needed. It has been calibrating hunger in Gaza for
  decades, initially calculating shipments to exert pressure while avoiding
  starvation. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make
  them die of hunger,” a senior adviser to the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert,
  said in 2006… Data compiled and published by Israel’s own government makes
  clear that it has been starving Gaza. Between March and June, Israel allowed
  just 56,000 tonnes of food to enter the territory, Cogat records show, less
  than a quarter of Gaza’s minimum needs for that period. Even if every bag of
  UN flour had been collected and handed out, and the Gaza Humanitarian
  Foundation had developed safe systems for equitable distribution, starvation
  was inevitable. Palestinians did not have enough to eat. Israel will partially
  reopen private sector trade with Gaza to reduce its reliance on humanitarian
  aid, the defence ministry civil affairs agency for the Palestinian territories
  said on Tuesday. “As part of formulating the mechanism, a limited number of
  local merchants were approved by the defence establishment, subject to several
  criteria and strict security screening,” Cogat said. Israel imposed a total
  blockade on 2 March, partially lifted in May to allow a US-backed private
  agency to open food distribution centres but hundreds of Palestinians have
  since been killed around the sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation
  (GHF). As Agence France-Presse reports, aid convoys and airdrops by Arab and
  European militaries resumed last month, as UN-mandated expert reports warned
  famine was unfolding in the war-torn territory. The Cogat statement, posted on
  X, said private sector deliveries would be paid for by monitored bank
  transfers and be subject to inspections by the Israeli military before
  entering Gaza, “to prevent the involvement of the Hamas terrorist
  organisation”. Permitted goods under the new mechanism will include food
  staples, fruit, vegetables, baby formula and hygiene products, Cogat said. It
  is not clear how much trade will be involved. Palestinian and UN officials
  said Gaza needs about 600 aid trucks to enter per day to meet the humanitarian
  requirements – the number Israel used to allow into Gaza before the war. New
  images of two skeletal hostages have horrified Israelis and added pressure on
  Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire, even as his government considers
  another expansion of the war, which has already destroyed much of Gaza and
  pushed it toward famine. In the video released by the Islamic Jihad militant
  group, Rom Braslavski says injuries in his foot prevent him from being able to
  stand. In another video, released by Hamas, Evyatar David says he is digging
  his own grave and speaks of days without food. The footage has stirred
  condemnation. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres was “very shocked” by the
  videos, Associated Press reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross
  said it was “appalled by the harrowing videos” and called for access to the
  hostages. Hamas said it is ready to respond “positively” to Red Cross requests
  to deliver food to hostages, if humanitarian corridors for aid deliveries are
  opened in a “regular and permanent manner” in Gaza. It denied starving the
  hostages, saying they suffer from the same hunger as ordinary Palestinians.
  Ofir Braslavski said that in the video of his son, the captors appear to be
  well-fed. “This hunger is on purpose,” he said. Israel has requested an
  emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on the hostages, which will take
  place on Tuesday. Israel’s goreign minister, Gideon Saar, said he will travel
  to New York for the meeting. Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his security
  cabinet this week to decide on Israel’s next steps in Gaza following the
  collapse of indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas, with one senior Israeli
  source suggesting more force could be an option. On Saturday, during a visit
  to the country, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had said he was working
  with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the war in
  Gaza. But Israeli officials have also floated ideas that include expanding the
  military offensive in Gaza and annexing parts of the shattered enclave.
  Israel’s Channel 12 cited an official from his office as saying that Netanyahu
  was inclining towards expanding the offensive and seizing the entire
  Palestinian enclave. Elsewhere, a UN expert who first warned that Israel was
  orchestrating a campaign of deliberate mass starvation in Gaza more than 500
  days ago, has said that governments and corporations cannot claim to be
  surprised at the horror now unfolding. “Israel has built the most efficient
  starvation machine you can imagine. So while it’s always shocking to see
  people being starved, no one should act surprised. All the information has
  been out in the open since early 2024,” Michael Fakhri, the UN special
  rapporteur on the right to food, told the Guardian.

More than anything, they need a ceasefire, Now.” it added. An Israeli security cabinet meeting, which had been expected to discuss Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for the “full occupation” of Gaza, has been postponed amid mounting tensions over whether the plan is feasible. Amid a stalling of ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israeli officials had briefed local and international media that the prime minister was considering an expansive offensive, aimed at taking full control of the Palestinian territory after 22 months of war against the militant group Hamas. However, senior Israeli military officers and former senior commanders warned the plan would endanger the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, risk further international isolation of Israel and require Israeli soldiers to administer a population in which Hamas fighters were still present. Any move towards full occupation is likely to be strongly resisted by large parts of the international community, already horrified by the conduct of Israel’s military campaign. Israel’s scorched-earth campaign has already obliterated large parts of Gaza, killing more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, forcing nearly all of Gaza’s more than 2 million people from their homes and causing what a global hunger monitor last week called an unfolding famine. That has caused widespread international anger and prompted several European countries to say they would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire, amid mounting calls for sanctions against Israel. The disquiet follows briefings to Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had decided the expanded offensive was a foregone conclusion. “The die has been cast. We’re going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating Hamas,” the unnamed sources said, quoting Netanyahu. Gaza’s government media office has posted to Telegram to say that only 95 aid trucks entered the territory on Monday. The media office said most of the aid trucks were looted due to the “security chaos sowed” by Israel with the ultimate aim of undermining the “cohesion of society”. We remind you that the Strip needs no less than 600 relief and fuel trucks daily to meet the minimum health, food and service requirements, amidst a comprehensive collapse of the infrastructure and the ongoing war of genocide. We condemn the continued crime of systematic starvation, the closure of crossings and the prevention of the entry of aid, and we hold the occupation and its allies fully responsible for the worsening humanitarian disaster that affects more than 2.4 million people. We call on the international community and the Arab world to take effective action to permanently open the crossings, ensure the flow of food and medical aid, and baby formula in sufficient and safe quantities, and hold the occupation accountable for its crimes against civilians. Israeli officials have variously denied the existence of mass starvation, claimed without evidence that Hamas steals and hoards aid and blamed hunger on UN distribution failures. UN-backed food security experts said at the end of last month that a “worst-case scenario” famine was now unfolding in Gaza and called for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”. At least 61,020 Palestinian people have been killed and 150,671 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. At least 87 Palestinian people, including 52 aid seekers, were killed and 644 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. In a post on Telegram, the health ministry wrote: A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the streets, as ambulances and civil defense crews are unable to reach them until now. Over the past 24 hours, hospitals in the Gaza Strip recorded 8 new deaths due to famine and malnutrition, including a child, the ministry added in the Telegram post. This brings the total number of Palestinian people who have died from famine and malnutrition to 188, including 94 children. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Gaza: Reuters is reporting that Israeli tanks pushed into central Gaza this morning but it was not clear if the move was part of a larger ground assault. Palestinian people living in the last fifth of the territory Israel has not taken military control of – or put under evacuation orders – said any new move to occupy the area would be catastrophic. “If the tanks pushed through, where would we go, into the sea? This will be like a death sentence to the entire population,” Abu Jehad, a Gaza wood merchant, told Reuters. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says one of its volunteers in Khan Younis, Abdel Majeed Adnan Salamah, was killed by Israeli forces as he searched for food in Gaza. In a post on X, the PRCS wrote: Since the start of the war, Abdel Majeed worked tirelessly with PRCS ambulance teams, risking his life to rescue the wounded and injured. Two days ago, he left in search of food in the so-called the “US-Israeli aid zone” west of Rafah. There, Israeli forces targeted him – along with other starving civilians. He never made it back. Abdel Majeed was killed while simply trying to survive. Like all Gazans, our teams and volunteers are enduring severe hunger. Yet despite the exhaustion, they continue their life-saving work, committed to easing the suffering of others. Shrai Popat is a politics blogger for Guardian US More than a dozen Democratic members of Congress have signed on to a letter that urges the Trump administration to recognise Palestinian statehood, in a draft copy shared with the Guardian. Congressman Ro Khanna of California is leading the letter addressed to the president and secretary of state Marco Rubio, and is joined by several House progressives, including Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Maxwell Frost of Florida. “This tragic moment has highlighted for the world the long overdue need to recognize Palestinian self-determination,” the letter reads. “Just as the lives of Palestinians must be immediately protected, so too must their rights as a people and nation urgently be acknowledged and upheld.” The letter comes as human rights experts sound the alarm over the unfolding famine in Gaza, and as some of Israel’s key western allies, including France and Canada, have recently pledged to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly. You can read the full story here: At least 74 Palestinian people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza yesterday, including 36 people seeking aid supplies, according to Al Jazeera, which cited medical sources in its reporting. We have not been able to independently verify this information yet. At least 1,400 people have been killed while seeking aid since 27 May 2025, most of whom were killed near US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) sites, while other Palestinian people were killed along the routes of aid convoys, the UN said on Friday. GHF aid sites replaced the traditional UN distribution mechanism in May after Israel accused Hamas of looting UN aid, a charge Hamas denies. Aid officials say little humanitarian assistance went astray during the short-lived ceasefire that came into effect in January. Critics have argued that the GHF is a tool for the Israeli and US governments to politicise humanitarian aid and to distribute it in ways that will depopulate sectors of Gaza in apparent violation of international law. US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, discussed the “humanitarian situation in Gaza” and ceasefire negotiations in calls with the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot yesterday. The Israeli government is reportedly exploring the idea of intensifying its military assault as ceasefire negotiations have stalled – which it blames on Hamas. The US and Israel withdrew their negotiators from Doha, Qatar’s capital, 11 days ago and said they would explore “alternative options” to retrieve the hostages. Israel has been widely accused of using food as a political weapon and of flagrantly breaking international law by collectively punishing the civilian population of Gaza by its aid blockade. Aid organisations were bringing somewhere between 500 and 600 trucks a day into Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year, but now Israeli restrictions mean only a trickle of aid is being allowed into the territory (only 36 aid trucks entered on Saturday, for example, according to Gaza’s government media office). The Guardian’s chief Middle East correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, has broken down in great detail how Israel has deliberately caused a famine in Gaza. Here is an extract from her piece: The mathematics of famine are simple in Gaza. Palestinians cannot leave, war has ended farming and Israel has banned fishing, so practically every calorie its population eats must be brought in from outside. Israel knows how much food is needed. It has been calibrating hunger in Gaza for decades, initially calculating shipments to exert pressure while avoiding starvation. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” a senior adviser to the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said in 2006… Data compiled and published by Israel’s own government makes clear that it has been starving Gaza. Between March and June, Israel allowed just 56,000 tonnes of food to enter the territory, Cogat records show, less than a quarter of Gaza’s minimum needs for that period. Even if every bag of UN flour had been collected and handed out, and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had developed safe systems for equitable distribution, starvation was inevitable. Palestinians did not have enough to eat. Israel will partially reopen private sector trade with Gaza to reduce its reliance on humanitarian aid, the defence ministry civil affairs agency for the Palestinian territories said on Tuesday. “As part of formulating the mechanism, a limited number of local merchants were approved by the defence establishment, subject to several criteria and strict security screening,” Cogat said. Israel imposed a total blockade on 2 March, partially lifted in May to allow a US-backed private agency to open food distribution centres but hundreds of Palestinians have since been killed around the sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). As Agence France-Presse reports, aid convoys and airdrops by Arab and European militaries resumed last month, as UN-mandated expert reports warned famine was unfolding in the war-torn territory. The Cogat statement, posted on X, said private sector deliveries would be paid for by monitored bank transfers and be subject to inspections by the Israeli military before entering Gaza, “to prevent the involvement of the Hamas terrorist organisation”. Permitted goods under the new mechanism will include food staples, fruit, vegetables, baby formula and hygiene products, Cogat said. It is not clear how much trade will be involved. Palestinian and UN officials said Gaza needs about 600 aid trucks to enter per day to meet the humanitarian requirements – the number Israel used to allow into Gaza before the war. New images of two skeletal hostages have horrified Israelis and added pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire, even as his government considers another expansion of the war, which has already destroyed much of Gaza and pushed it toward famine. In the video released by the Islamic Jihad militant group, Rom Braslavski says injuries in his foot prevent him from being able to stand. In another video, released by Hamas, Evyatar David says he is digging his own grave and speaks of days without food. The footage has stirred condemnation. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres was “very shocked” by the videos, Associated Press reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was “appalled by the harrowing videos” and called for access to the hostages. Hamas said it is ready to respond “positively” to Red Cross requests to deliver food to hostages, if humanitarian corridors for aid deliveries are opened in a “regular and permanent manner” in Gaza. It denied starving the hostages, saying they suffer from the same hunger as ordinary Palestinians. Ofir Braslavski said that in the video of his son, the captors appear to be well-fed. “This hunger is on purpose,” he said. Israel has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on the hostages, which will take place on Tuesday. Israel’s goreign minister, Gideon Saar, said he will travel to New York for the meeting. Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his security cabinet this week to decide on Israel’s next steps in Gaza following the collapse of indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas, with one senior Israeli source suggesting more force could be an option. On Saturday, during a visit to the country, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had said he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the war in Gaza. But Israeli officials have also floated ideas that include expanding the military offensive in Gaza and annexing parts of the shattered enclave. Israel’s Channel 12 cited an official from his office as saying that Netanyahu was inclining towards expanding the offensive and seizing the entire Palestinian enclave. Elsewhere, a UN expert who first warned that Israel was orchestrating a campaign of deliberate mass starvation in Gaza more than 500 days ago, has said that governments and corporations cannot claim to be surprised at the horror now unfolding. “Israel has built the most efficient starvation machine you can imagine. So while it’s always shocking to see people being starved, no one should act surprised. All the information has been out in the open since early 2024,” Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, told the Guardian.
