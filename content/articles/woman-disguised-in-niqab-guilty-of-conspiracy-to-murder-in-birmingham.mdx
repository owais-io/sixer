  A would-be killer who tried to shoot a rival at point-blank range while
  disguised in a niqab has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder. Aimee
  Betro, 45, who is originally from the US, flew to the UK as part of a revenge
  plot orchestrated by father and son co-conspirators Mohammed Aslam, 59, and
  Mohammed Nabil Nazir, 31, to attack a family they had been feuding with.
  Jurors at Birmingham crown court deliberated for 21 hours before finding Betro
  guilty on the charges of conspiracy to murder, possessing a self-loading
  pistol with intent to cause fear of violence, and illegally importing
  ammunition. The jury, who had been given a majority direction by Judge Drew,
  found Betro guilty by 11-1 verdicts on the conspiracy to murder and firearm
  charges, and by a unanimous verdict on the ammunition charge. Betro, from
  Wisconsin, did not react and merely stared towards the jury bench as the
  verdicts were read out. She remained emotionless when escorted back to her
  cell. The court heard how she had tried to shoot Sikander Ali outside his home
  in Yardley, Birmingham, on the evening of 7 September 2019, but her handgun
  jammed. Betro told the court that she had met Nazir on a dating app and had
  travelled to the UK twice before the attempted killing to spend time with him,
  including between December 2018 and January 2019. She told jurors that the
  third trip was to celebrate her birthday and attend a boat party. CCTV footage
  presented to the court showed Betro standing outside Ali’s suburban home
  shortly before 8pm on 7 September. As Ali exited his car, Betro was shown to
  pull out a handgun but failed to fire any rounds, with Ali jumping back into
  his car and driving away. Jurors heard that Betro and her co-conspirators
  targeted the victim after Aslam and Nazir were injured during a physical
  altercation in a shop owned by Ali’s father, Aslat Mahumad, which led the pair
  to resolve to have him or a member of his family killed as retribution. After
  the failed murder attempt, the court heard that Betro texted Ali’s father
  messages such as “Where are you hiding?” and “Stop playing hide and seek, you
  are lucky it jammed.” The court was told that hours later, Betro returned to
  Ali’s home in a taxi and fired three rounds into his now empty house, before
  leaving again. The defence barrister, Paul Lewis KC, said he was not asking
  for pre-sentence reports as they would not assist the court. Drew told the
  court: “I suspect Miss Betro would like to know the outcome of this case and
  there is nothing worse than sitting waiting.” Betro, who fled to the US while
  Aslam and Nazir were tried in the same court, spent several years in Armenia
  after the attempted murder, before being arrested last summer and extradited
  to the UK in January this year. John Sheehan, the head of the Crown
  Prosecution Service’s extradition unit that returned Betro to the UK, called
  the operation a “complex investigation and extradition process”. He said he
  hoped the conviction would send a clear message that the CPS would “pursue
  criminals who attempt to evade justice, and make sure that they are brought to
  a courtroom to be held accountable for their actions”. Betro is due to be
  sentenced on Thursday 21 August.
