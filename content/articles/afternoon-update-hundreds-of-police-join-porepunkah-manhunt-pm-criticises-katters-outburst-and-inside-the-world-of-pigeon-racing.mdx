  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. On the fourth day of the manhunt for
  Dezi Freeman, Victoria police confirmed a woman taken into custody after a
  Thursday night raid on a property in Porepunkah was Freeman’s wife. The
  56-year-old Freeman, a so-called “sovereign citizen”, is accused of killing
  two police officers and injuring another in the Victorian town, which is home
  to about 1,000 people. Victoria police’s chief commissioner, Mike Bush, told a
  press conference this afternoon that the woman was arrested alongside a
  15-year-old male, who were both interviewed and released “pending further
  inquiries”. “There may or may not be charges that follow,” Bush said. He said
  more than 450 police officers are now involved in the search, which he
  described as a “very professional and coordinated operation” aided by
  “fantastic” assistance from locals. There have been no confirmed sightings of
  Freeman since he fled into the bush on Tuesday. Top news Labor greenlights
