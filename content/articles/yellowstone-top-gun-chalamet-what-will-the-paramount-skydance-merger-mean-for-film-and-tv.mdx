  The merger between Paramount and Skydance has finally been completed, with
  various roadblocks (including Stephen Colbert, apparently, as well as the
  related 60 Minutes settlement/bribery) cleared from the path of a new entity
  called Paramount, A Skydance Corporation. It’s an appropriately franchise-y
  moniker for a merger between a major Hollywood studio and a company that made
  its bones as a constant financer of some of its biggest movie series. This
  ends (for now) years of speculation over what might be done with Paramount, a
  global conglomerate that was nonetheless considered on less sure footing than
  its fellow remaining big five studios, Disney, Sony, Universal and Warner
  Bros. (Well, maybe not the recently embattled Warner Bros, though they seem to
  have gotten a major reprieve with their killer 2025 slate) Skydance honcho
  David Ellison is the new Paramount CEO. The new co-chairs of Paramount
  Pictures will be Skydance executive Dana Goldberg and former Sony executive
  Josh Greenstein. But with Ellison at the top boasting years of Skydance
  experience, he’ll ultimately be determining Paramount’s fortunes as a movie
  and TV company. The son of billionaire Larry Ellison, David for years seemed
  like he got into the movies primarily to work in closer proximity to
  airplanes. His first film as a producer was the 2005 flop Flyboys, a world war
  one fighter-pilot drama that was an early strike against the burgeoning movie
  career of star James Franco. Undeterred, the next year he founded Skydance
  Media, the kind of thing a 23-year-old budding pilot can do if they happen
  also to be a billionaire’s son. Over the years, the company co-financed a
  number of big Paramount productions. They didn’t all or even mostly involve
  fighter planes, but they did include big Paramount brands (Mission:
  Impossible, Star Trek), would-be franchise-starters and restarters (Jack
  Reacher, Jack Ryan, a couple of Terminators) and, in what Ellison must have
  considered his crowning achievement, Top Gun: Maverick, for which he received
  a best picture nomination as one of the film’s producers. So does this
  indicate that Paramount will move towards making Top Gun even more of a
  signature title, the platonic ideal of billion-dollar nostalgia franchise with
  ample access to expensive fighter planes? Maybe. In some ways, the Skydance
  merger isn’t as grim as other corporate acquisitions in this field. Ellison is
  just 42, which sets him apart from someone like Bob Iger (who recently
  unretired in his 70s and still hasn’t set a proper successor). The deal also
  doesn’t consolidate Paramount under another studio’s umbrella, the way that
  20th Century Fox went from storied, century-old cinema legacy to Disney
  shingle that mostly revives franchises from its catalog and produces
  lower-budget offerings directly for streaming. (This was a possibility for
  Paramount; Sony was apparently looking at acquiring them.) Nor does the merger
  put another movie studio under the control of a tech company. Though it’s not
  exactly known for an art-forward sensibility – like, say, Annapurna, the more
  prestigious movie company that David’s sister, Megan, founded in 2011 –
  Skydance is still mainly an entertainment firm. What, then, might be expected
  from Paramount in the Skydance era? The relative narrowness of previous
  Skydance operations suggests an ongoing ignorance about how to run other
  aspects of the business, such as the news division of CBS. Ellison has talked
  a bit about keeping CBS trustworthy and independent, but a leading 60 Minutes
  producer already quit, pre-merger, over pre-merger interference from
  Paramount. Ellison also made comments about most people identifying as
  “center-right” or “center-left”, a thinking that suggests he’s looking at
  journalism in terms of pleasing his audience, rather than doing reporting that
  might prompt baseless charges of bias. Less of an ethical challenge but
  central to the Paramount business is the ongoing dip in value of the company’s
  signature cable brands – they own MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and
  Showtime, among others – which other companies have dealt with by spinning off
  into separate entities. But these channels are arguably more tied into
  Paramount’s identity; Nickelodeon, for example, has provided a steady stream
  of movie hits in addition to TV franchises. They will probably stay put for
  now (though that won’t protect them from layoffs). Between those brands and
  the company’s seeming political triangulating, it seems likely that the
  importance of Taylor Sheridan, whose universe of centrist-appeal western shows
  does so well in traditional TV terms, will only increase. Despite that cable
  legacy, streaming and “non-linear” TV are said to be a priority for the
  company, with Ellison mentioning a dedication to premium streaming-only movies
  and shows in his day-one open letter. Though Skydance had some success working
  on big-picture theatrical franchises for Paramount, their branched-out efforts
  to provide content for various streaming services has been more typical of
  that arena – that is, often expensive but somehow still low-rent. Ghosted,
  Heart of Stone, 6 Underground … several of the interchangeable streaming
  caper/spy movies that feel more like mockbusters than events have Skydance’s
  name on them. They often feel, in fact, like knockoffs of the movies Paramount
  might have made for theaters in the 2000s and 2010s. Skydance also attempted
  to start their own animation studio by employing the disgraced former Pixar
  head John Lasseter, which so far has resulted in the twin embarrassments of
  Luck (on Apple TV+) and Spellbound (on Netflix). The company does have an
  animated project from the Incredibles creator Brad Bird in the works, as well
  as a cartoon called, uh, Pookoo. They’re also shooting a live-action project
  called Matchbox. This is not a code name. It is based on the toy cars. Those
  movies won’t be on the Paramount slate, but they could be indicative of where
  the corporate heads are at when it comes time to rebuild the movie studio.
  Ellison may not be a tech CEO, but his billionaire dad is; Larry Ellison
  co-founded Oracle. That mix of established money and a vaguely tech-forward
  outlook could turn out to be recent-big-business as usual. The real question
  mark regarding Skydance is how (or if) they might handle the stuff that
  doesn’t involve blatant imitating or trend-chasing that every big studio does.
  (Has any movie studio undergoing a shift in the past decade declared an
  intention not to leverage a bunch of supposedly valuable old IP?) Recent past
  periods of creativity flourishing at Paramount seemed almost accidental. In
  the mid-to-late 2010s, for example, the studio had a few years where they made
  or distributed Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival, Richard Linklater’s Everybody Wants
  Some!!, Alexander Payne’s Downsizing, Darren Aronofsky’s Mother!, Martin
  Scorsese’s Silence, and Denzel Washington’s Fences, among others, boldly
  supporting movies made by and for thinking adults. (They also made some pretty
  decent franchise movies with Skydance, such as Star Trek Beyond and several
  Mission: Impossible entries.) It doesn’t seem like Skydance’s first priority
  it would be replicating any of those grownup movies, even a hit like Arrival.
  Yet it is hopeful that the first announced Paramount Pictures deal brokered by
  Goldberg and Greenstein is a James Mangold-directed, Timothée
  Chalamet-starring original film called High Side – in other words, an
  old-fashioned, A-list-director-and-star combination. Maybe Ellison and his
  lieutenants are able to reach back to more Paramount-specific projects – their
  thrillers of the 70s, the star-driven comedies of the 80s and 90s, the
  surprise inventiveness of their affiliation with MTV films – and do a little
  more than play with Matchbox cars and fighter jets.
