  Mother Vera review – luminous portrait of a horse-wrangling ex-heroin addict
  nun

  The opening sequence is extraordinary: a nun drops to the floor in devotion,
  hidden under the swathes of black habit puddling across the stone floor. There
  is more of this to come in photographer Alys Tomlinson and film-maker Cécile
  Embleton’s beautiful black and white documentary. It is film of stillness,
  long, long takes and careful framing – and would look at home playing on the
  walls of an art gallery. But Mother Vera, with its intense, luminous portrait
  of a woman, is not an austere art film. Her name is Vera, a nun in a remote
  Orthodox monastery in Belarus; you could cast her as Joan of Arc, with her
  beautiful fierce face. The setting itself might be medieval, but then out
  steps Vera into a bitingly cold wintry day, wearing a floor-length Puffa. She
  runs the convent stables, and seems to be most herself with the horses. On the
  voiceover Vera explains that before becoming a nun she was married, and a
  heroin addict. She came to the convent for a year while her husband went to
  prison. “I didn’t want to be a nun.” To say any more would give too much away.
  The convent itself is fascinating, home to at least a hundred men who seem to
  all be ex-prisoners and addicts. At points it feels like you’re watching
  drama. There’s an uncomfortably tense scene when a meeting is called to
  discuss expelling a man for having “downcast” status – he’s an untouchable
  because he was raped in prison. The priest chairing the meeting (channelling a
  bit of Jesus-overturning-tables-in-the-temple rage) answers roughly that we
  are equal in God’s eyes. Mostly though, we are with Vera. For long stretches
  the film is wordless and requires a commitment of attention. But Vera herself
  is an intense, powerful character, speaking with ruthless honesty on the
  voiceover; rather than being passively observed by the film-makers, she
  invites us in to her inner world. It’s riveting. • Mother Vera is in UK and
  Irish cinemas from 29 August.
