  As a plus-size shopper, separates are a tricky game: finding denim that
  doesn’t sag at the knee and gape at the back is a constant plight, I have yet
  to experience tailoring that contours my curves in a well-fitting way, and I
  have never met a co-ord that doesn’t make me look like a human Flump. But
  dresses can be good to me. That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market
  in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and
  not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to
  launch a collaboration with dress brand Rixo – a 16-piece collection of
  size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one
  swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you
  are good. Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in
  my floral design for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what
  plus-size shoppers need from a dress. I know that dresses can be generous in
  silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my
  size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going
  into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses
  that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high
  street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a
  tie-dye tunic from Zara (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my
  surprise, walked away with. Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate
  unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their
  sizing tends to run. I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its
  sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its oversized shirt dress (€245, or about
  £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always
  as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that
  became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length
  Bernadette dress (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body.
  The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the
  UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate
  enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked
  the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in
  front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I
  belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees.
  That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and
  felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being
  in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of
  shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it
  nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the
  colour received more compliments that I could count. On a side note, if you’re
  looking to dip into the mellow butter-yellow trend, Never Fully Dressed has
  whipped up a dress (£129) that is size-inclusive and ideal for any and all
  summer soirees. Don’t get me wrong – I still stumbled and fumbled on the red
  carpet, and barely took a breath as I heard the shutters of cameras clicking
  (in shock that they were pointing at me), but in that dress I felt good. Good
  enough to take up space, good enough to walk through the world carefree, good
  enough to walk through previously unopened doors, and good enough to belong.
