  ‘An undercurrent of impenetrable sadness’: the tragic TV debut of Katie Price
  and Peter Andre’s daughter

  There is something slightly sweet about the new ITV2 show The Princess
  Diaries. It is a reality series about a girl nearing 18, trying to figure out
  what she wants her life to look like. Which is perfectly relatable. The girl
  is awkward and self-conscious, doing her best to navigate a world more
  complicated than she expected. Except the subject of The Princess Diaries is
  Princess Andre, AKA Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre, AKA the daughter of
  Peter Andre and Katie Price. This immediately makes things less relatable,
  because Princess has grown up under the spotlight, with the tabloid furore
  that her parents delight in whipping up on a daily basis. Would you be that
  well adjusted if newspapers flew drones over your bankrupt mother’s mansion to
  show the world how unkempt her garden was? Or if your dad found himself in the
  middle of a cultural appropriation storm after wearing a dreadlock wig for a
  film called Jafaican? Or if one of your middle names was Tiaamii? This is the
  bind The Princess Diaries finds itself in. On the one hand, Princess
  desperately wants to appear as a regular teenage girl. But on the other, there
  is a distinct possibility that the show was made to capitalise on all the
  rubberneckers who want to see what sort of trouble Price has got herself into
  now. If you are one of those hoping for news of Price’s exploits, you are
  going to come away disappointed. Because the main takeaway of The Princess
  Diaries is how relentlessly boring Princess’s life is. She is a 17-year-old
  girl whose job involves being an influencer. This means that her entire life
  is spent on her phone. She has “content days”, when she roams about,
  attempting to look carefree, in enough outfits to eke out a month’s worth of
  Instagram posts. She makes vague plans to launch her own beauty line, which at
  this stage means looking at pictures of other people’s beauty lines. She
  intermittently screws up her nose because a middle-aged man has DMd her a
  grotty message about her feet. It is excruciatingly monotonous. Princess lives
  with Peter Andre and his second wife. Andre and Price do not get along. So
  while we do get glimpses of Price, they are via video chats (of which we get
  only the audio, not least because Price is undressed in some of them) and
  descriptions (such as when Princess reveals that Price got the date of her
  birthday wrong). There is an undercurrent of impenetrable sadness. A little
  like the recent Alec Baldwin reality show, in which the scrappily chaotic
  idealism of his home life kept dropping away in segments where he addressed
  the accident when he shot and killed his cinematographer, there is a deep vein
  of melancholy to The Princess Diaries. For every film premiere and Ibiza
  fashion show, there is an introspective cutaway where Princess tells everyone
  how unhappy her childhood was, how she was picked on at school, and the
  feelings of self-hatred she experienced. But as soon as these bubble up, they
  are brushed away, because, look, a dog has just dribbled sausage grease on her
  new Louis Vuitton flip-flops! Everything’s fine again, promise! It was
  inevitable that Princess Andre would get her own show. After all, as she
  points out, reality TV is all she has known since she was born. She has been
  sucked along in the undercurrent of her parents’ careers – she has either
  appeared in or been adjacent to Katie &amp; Peter: The Baby Diaries, Katie
  &amp; Peter: Unleashed, Katie &amp; Peter: Down Under, Katie &amp; Peter:
  Stateside, Peter Andre: Going It Alone, Peter Andre: The Next Chapter, Katie
  Price’s Mucky Mansion, Peter Andre: My Life and Katie Price: My Crazy Life.
  However, on the basis of this series, it might have been worth waiting until
  Princess got her own gig. She is clearly smart and self-aware, and far better
  adjusted than you might expect. One day, when she has managed to clear the
  orbit of her ridiculous childhood, Princess Andre will be able to look back
  and put everything she has experienced into perspective. That day has yet to
  come. Instead, we have four hours of a 17-year-old girl looking at a phone.
  Surely that is too much reality for anyone. • All episodes are available to
  stream on ITVX now.
