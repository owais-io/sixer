  Bullying, sexual violence, love-starved relationships, murder and desperate,
  unending boredom. Never mind trigger warnings: these are the narrative pillars
  of Shostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, the opera decried by
  Stalin as “muddle instead of music”. Stalin’s sudden condemnation was
  thoroughly political, of course – but British music critics were similarly
  taken aback after the first UK performance in 1936. “Some of it is clever
  parody, but much of it is crude,” sniffed the Daily Mail. Almost 90 years
  later, the opera remains unequivocally grim. Like its UK premiere, this Proms
  outing was a concert performance in English translation. Without the trappings
  of a full staging or the linguistic buffer of the original Russian libretto,
  the nastiness of this tale of a rape that starts an affair that leads to two
  murders seemed even more inescapable than usual. Ruth Knight’s semi-staging
  involved minimal paraphernalia – an iron bed, a small table, a wooden witness
  box – but used lighting to melodramatic effect. Harsh spotlights isolated
  characters. The digital screens behind the performers switched several times
  to blinding white, transforming the Chorus of English National Opera Chorus
  into a mob in silhouette. The entire stage was bathed periodically in red. No
  wonder the audience giggled as Nicky Spence’s Sergey muttered “Now we’re
  really in the shit,” as the betrayed husband approached the lovers’ bedroom:
  light relief was in distinctly short supply. For all that Shostakovich called
  the piece a “tragic satire” and included numerous lively musical parodies – of
  ballroom dances and operetta, circus music and brass-band oompah – conductor
  John Storgårds kept the BBC Philharmonic deadly serious. There were rude
  bassoons (grittily flatulent in their lowest register) and even ruder,
  detumescent trombones, strings that waltzed and woodwind that fidgeted. But
  Storgårds allowed no levity. Long stretches of the score function as
  mid-century modern wallpaper, the orchestra ticking over in the background, as
  restless as the heroine. Occasionally, Storgårds coaxed quiet passages of
  stunning tenderness; but climaxes crashed relentlessly in vast waves of
  blaring brass and vicious timpani strokes. That the solo voices struggled at
  times to compete only added to the performance’s increasingly acute
  claustrophobia. Brindley Sherratt was on rich-voiced, characterful form as
  Boris, the piece’s appalling patriarch. As his son and the heroine’s husband,
  John Findon had both the vocal power and imposing stage presence to resist any
  suspicion that the character is purely a pushover. There were impressive
  contributions from Ava Dodd and Niamh O’Sullivan as alternative lust-objects.
  But nothing was more striking or disturbing than the interaction between
  Spence’s Sergey and Amanda Majeski’s Katerina: the former heroically clarion
  even while dramatically faithless, the latter a terrifyingly lyrical portrait
  of a woman “so bored I could hang myself” – or, as it turns out, commit
  murder. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue
  until 13 September.
