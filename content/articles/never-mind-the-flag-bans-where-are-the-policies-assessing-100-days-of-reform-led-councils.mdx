  Reform-led councils

  “This motion is bizarre to say the least,” said a bemused Doncaster Labour
  councillor as Reform proposed that the council fly no flags apart from the
  union flag from its buildings. It would not just mean no Pride flag on Pride
  Day, a debate heard. It would mean no white rose flag on Yorkshire Day, no
  Rovers flag celebrating the football team winning the league, no St George’s
  flag marking England’s Lionesses’ Euros triumph, and no green flags
  celebrating municipal park management achievements in the city’s green spaces.
  The motion was “a waste of time and a waste of resources”, one councillor
  said. Meanwhile, at Nottinghamshire county council, climate change was being
  discussed. Bert Bingham is the Reform councillor now responsible for the
  council’s environmental policies. He does not believe human-made climate
  change exists, saying it is a “hoax” and that declaring a climate emergency is
  “ridiculous and nonsensical”. The media had brainwashed the public about the
  whole subject, he said. In Kent, a Reform councillor boasted about ensuring
  the removal of “trans-ideological material and books” from the children’s
  section of the county’s libraries. It later emerged the books were not there
  in the first place. In Durham, the Reform deputy council leader, a gay man,
  pledged that Durham Pride “won’t get a single penny from this council next
  year”. It received less than £10,000 from the council this year. Welcome to
  the world of local government in England after the success of Nigel Farage’s
  Reform party on 1 May this year. The party recently celebrated 100 days in
  power in local councils with an extensive press release trumpeting its work,
  including “rolling back the net zero agenda” and “flying patriotic flags”. It
  boasted of Staffordshire county council’s attempt to stop all solar, wind or
  battery farms, and Kent council cancelling climate-friendly property
  modifications, as well as other decisions including not upgrading buses to
  electric vehicles and scrapping EV charging points. Farage has been front and
  centre on the summer front pages, which aides said was part of a desire to
  look more prime ministerial, holding a press conference every Monday of the
  parliamentary recess. Here, he has announced a slew of defections, not only of
  former Tory MPs but a number of key local politicians, including a Tory police
  and crime commissioner and a member of the Scottish parliament. Though much of
  the national party focus has been on small boats and asylum hotels –
  particularly the controversy over the Bell hotel in Essex – Farage has begun
  to turn the national spotlight on to houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) used
  to accommodate asylum seekers. Reform councils are also beginning to emphasise
  these, setting up another potential national flashpoint. Durham and West
  Northamptonshire councils have begun crackdowns on the use and conversion of
  HMOs. Reform is on a high but how effective is it in power? Has anything
  changed for residents? Why did people vote for the party and what do they
  expect? Reform won outright majorities in Kent, Durham, Derbyshire,
  Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, North
  Northamptonshire, West Northamptonshire and Doncaster. In the Hull and East
  Yorkshire combined authority, Luke Campbell, a former Olympic boxer, was
  elected as its first mayor. The party was mostly wresting control from the
  Conservatives but election night was also terrible for Labour. In Durham,
  Reform succeeded a coalition of Liberal Democrats, independents and
  Conservatives in what was once a solid Labour stronghold. This year, Labour
  won four seats compared with Reform’s 65. To put that into perspective, in
  2017 Labour had 94 of the council’s then 126 seats. It now has four of 98
  seats. ‘Telling us like it is’ On the streets of Consett, once a proud,
  thriving steel town in County Durham, it is easy to find people who voted
  Reform. It is easy to find people who voted Labour at the general election. It
  is hard to find anyone who says they would vote for Keir Starmer’s Labour
  today. Corey Barron, 27, who was recently made redundant, said he used to vote
  Labour like all of his family. “Up here, all of us were Labour but look what
  has been done to the country in the past year,” he said. “Reform are the only
  ones telling us like it is. Labour have told us about a load of policies but
  haven’t stuck to them. Reform are the only ones being honest. People can see
  we need someone different.” Yvonne Hillier, a McDonald’s worker, said she was
  “Lib Dem through and through” but understood why so many people were voting
  Reform. Her two children, in their 20s, still live with her. “They just can’t
  afford to get on the housing ladder,” she said. “There are so many problems,
  so I can see why people voted Reform … but I couldn’t vote for them. I liked
  Nigel Farage in the jungle. I don’t like him the way he is now.” It is market
  day in Consett and there are just two stalls, including that of John Gardiner
  selling fruit, veg and flowers. “I’ve been coming 20 years and seen this
  street full, but not now,” he said. The farmer had always voted Conservative
  until May, when he voted Reform. “I think they [the Tories] are in a bit of a
  muddle at the moment, they need to sort themselves out. You just want anyone
  who gets in to do a good job.” Julie Walker, a receptionist and former Labour
  voter, ticked Reform for the first time at the council elections. “I just
  think we need somebody fresh and new,” she said. “I’m not a fan of Starmer, I
  just don’t think he cares what the average person thinks … immigration is a
  massive issue.” Many people the Guardian approached either said they had no
  interest or thought every party was as bad as the other. Of course, not
  everyone had voted Reform. “Are you fucking kidding me,” said Peter Wood when
  asked. “I blame the BBC for bringing Farage into the limelight.” His partner,
  Sheila Johnson, said she could not believe so many Reform councillors had been
  elected in Durham. “None of them have any experience. They don’t know what
  they are doing. God knows what’s going to happen.” Neither liked Starmer and
  both were thinking of supporting Jeremy Corbyn’s new party. As was Peter
  Monroe, a retired secondhand book dealer. “I disagree with all [Reform’s]
  policies,” he said. “I’m disheartened. The fact that Reform got in is terrible
  and it saddens me that it would happen in this strong, working-class area.
  “One of the first things they did when they got in at County Durham was ban
  flying the flag in solidarity with Ukraine at county hall. It was just wrong.”
  If an alien were to land in England this summer they would assume the English
  had an obsession with flags. Opposition councillors say flag policies have
  taken up an inordinate amount of debating time, and as how life has changed
  for residents, the answer is “not much”, they say. Some Reform councillors
  also acknowledge that. It will take time, they say. At the most recent full
  meeting of Warwickshire council, the Lib Dem councillor Sarah Boad complained
  of “stagnation … no ideas, no plans, except for silly, silly things that get
  press coverage but don’t actually help the residents of Warwickshire”. A
  clearly exasperated Reform councillor, Michael Bannister, replied: “We’ve been
  here two months and they want policy, policy, policy, policy.” The leader of
  Warwickshire council, an authority with a £2bn budget, is George Finch, a
  19-year-old who still lives at home and cannot drive. Wits have invoked Pitt
  the Younger, or “young snotty” from Blackadder the Third, when writing about
  Finch, providing an excuse to repeat some of the character’s best lines: “My
  three main policy priorities are: one, war with France; two, tougher sentences
  for geography teachers; and three, a right royal kick of the prince’s
  backside!” Finch has called critics of his lack of experience “ageist”. He
  told the BBC: “All I see is age … I don’t care about my age. Would people be
  questioning if there was a 70-year-old at the helm? Probably not. Joe Biden,
  Donald Trump, presidents that are older – no one questions it. But they’re
  questioning someone who is 19.” At West Northamptonshire, the Conservatives
  laid out a formal motion addressing the lack of a corporate plan from Reform.
  There was “no vision, no manifesto, no plan” from Reform, said the
  Conservative councillor Daniel Lister. But the council’s Reform leader, Mark
  Arnull, told the BBC: “The danger when we write manifestos is that sometimes
  you have to keep to them.” ‘Doge’ units The “give us time” plea is one that
  has been expressed by a number of Reform councillors. Political observers say
  it is a message that comes from not having had firm plans in the first place.
  Colin Talbot, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of
  Manchester, said: “I went through Reform’s national policy statements and they
  had no policies whatsoever on local government. Nothing at all. They really
  haven’t thought about local government and what they want to do with it.” In
  speeches before the election, Farage spoke of fixing a broken Britain, which
  included “broken councils”. On 2 May, he warned that council staff working on
  diversity or climate change initiatives should be “seeking alternative
  careers”. The party has pledged to save money by sending in an Elon Musk-style
  “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit to examine all council
  spending in the areas it controls. It would use artificial intelligence,
  advanced data analysis tools and forensic auditing techniques to “identify
  wasteful spending and recommend actionable solutions”. Talbot said he believed
  there was little scope for any major savings because councils had already gone
  through more than a decade of austerity. “There is nothing left to cut,
  basically.” He said the 10 councils Reform had control of had already agreed
  to savings totalling £500m because of the extreme financial pressure on local
  government. And even if they find possible savings, Reform’s “Doge units”
  might find it tricky to force through cuts. “These units are not part of the
  council,” Talbot said. “They’ve not been authorised by the council. They are
  Reform entities and they’ve got no legal standing with the council. I suspect
  council officials will put up roadblocks to them getting access to data and so
  on, unless they’re instructed to by Reform councillors. “Even then, I suspect
  they’ll be open to legal challenge if it involves handing over things like
  people’s personal data about their council taxes and so on. So they’re pretty
  hemmed in.” If anything, Reform has been accused of costing taxpayers money
  because of several byelections being held since May after its councillors
  stepped down for various reasons. Each byelection is estimated to cost
  councils £25,000. In Nottinghamshire, a Reform councillor quit after six days
  because, a full council meeting heard, “he realised he wasn’t up for the job”.
  A Conservative won the byelection. In Durham, a Reform councillor resigned
  after a week for failing to declare he worked for the council. A Lib Dem
  councillor was elected in his place. That is not to say the Reform bandwagon
  has stopped. Its candidates have won other byelections caused by resignations
  and the party also gained its first council seat at the polls in London – Alan
  Cook won a Bromley byelection from a turnout of 28%. ‘Wrong side of the tide’
  Reform continues to perform strongly in opinion polls, and many on the left
  and centre are worried. Talbot, who has experience of many elections over the
  decades, said Reform’s May victories needed to be treated with caution. “They
  have established quite a strong beachhead in local government,” he said.
  “However, beachhead is probably the right word because they’re on the wrong
  side of the tide. More than half of the councils they’ve taken over are
  top-tier county councils, which are due to disappear under the local
  government reorganisation.” Talbot said Reform’s success came from protest
  votes. “They only do well when they are standing for impotent levels of
  government, so Ukip did well when they stood for the European parliament. But
  when it comes to central government, actual elections not polls, they tend to
  do not very well at all. “Also, there aren’t any local charismatic leaders
  coming out of any of this. Reform isn’t the sort of party which would
  encourage that anyway … it’s Farage’s party. You can’t imagine anyone
  challenging him, whereas you can in the Lib Dems, Tories or Labour.” More than
  100 days into their tenure, Reform councils have faced hundreds of protesters
  outside full meetings. In Durham, they were casually dismissed by the deputy
  leader, Darren Grimes, as “the jobless masses”. Inside council chambers,
  Reform councillors are going out of their way to present a united front. In
  Durham, they posed for an awkward group photo wearing “Make Durham Great
  Again” baseball caps. How long can they stay united? Will Reform councils go
  the way of the only Ukip-led council, Thanet, where in 2015 the party lost its
  majority after less than five months because of splits. “They are, by nature,
  a bunch of mavericks and protesters and dissidents,” Talbot said. “They very
  quickly fall out with each other usually … there is no cultural cohesion to
  them as a party. They tend to fall apart very quickly.”
