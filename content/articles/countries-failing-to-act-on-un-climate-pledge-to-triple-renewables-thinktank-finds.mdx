  Most global governments have failed to act on the 2023 UN pledge to triple the
  world’s renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade, according to
  climate analysts. The failure to act means that on current forecasts the world
  will fall far short of its clean energy goals, leading to a continued reliance
  on fossil fuels that is incompatible with the target of limiting global
  heating to below 1.5C. A report by the climate thinktank Ember found that only
  22 countries, most within the EU, have increased their renewable energy
  ambitions since more than 130 signed up to the renewables pact at the UN’s
  Cop28 climate talks in Dubai almost two years ago. This means that the global
  sum of national renewables targets is now just 2% higher than at Cop28. While
  this could be enough to double the world’s renewable energy capacity from
  2022, to reach 7.4 terawatts (TW) by 2030, governments would fall well below
  the 11TW needed to meet the UN goal of tripling renewables, according to the
  analysts. “Tripling global renewables capacity by 2030 is the single biggest
  action this decade to stay on track for the 1.5C climate pathway,” the report
  said. “Yet, despite the landmark Cop28 agreement to reach 11,000GW of
  renewables by 2030, national targets remain largely unchanged and fall short
  of what is needed.” The report found that beyond the EU only seven countries
  have updated their renewable energy goals since the pact was signed, including
  Mexico and Indonesia, which have watered down their targets. Countries that
  have failed to act include the US, China and Russia, which are some of the
  world’s largest energy users and together are responsible for almost half of
  the world’s annual carbon emissions. The fate of the world’s renewable energy
  deal may depend on the actions of Beijing, which is expected to finalise its
  15th five-year plan for energy later this year, covering the period 2026-30.
  Washington and Moscow do not have renewable energy targets for 2030, and
  according to Ember their political leaders are not expected to set any. In
  India, clean energy targets have also remained unchanged, but the country’s
  ambition to build 500GW of renewables by 2030 is already aligned with the
  global goal to triple renewable energy capacity, the thinktank added. The
  country that has showed the greatest renewables ambition since Cop28 is
  Vietnam, which this year pledged to increase its capacity by 86GW by the end
  of the decade. Australia and Brazil have promised to increase their homegrown
  renewables by 18GW and 15GW. The UK upgraded its renewable energy plans last
  year with a pledge to build an extra 7GW of renewable energy by 2030 to reach
  the Labour government’s target to create a virtually carbon-free electricity
  system. In Korea, renewables are expected to grow by 9GW by 2030.
