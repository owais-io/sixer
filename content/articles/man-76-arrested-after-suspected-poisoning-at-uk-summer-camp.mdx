  A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after
  eight children at a summer camp were taken to hospital. Police and ambulance
  crews were deployed to the rural camp in Stathern, Leicestershire, after a
  report that a number of children had said they were unwell. The initial call
  was made on Sunday by a “third party”, Leicestershire police said. But it was
  not until Monday that police and ambulance crews were deployed. A triage
  centre was set up at the nearby Plungar village hall to assess the children
  who were at the camp. Eight children were then taken to hospital as a
  precaution, with all of them subsequently discharged. The children were at a
  summer camp in a youth centre called Stathern Lodge, which is owned by the
  Braithwaite Gospel Trust and is about a mile from the village. A
  representative of the trust said the centre provided self-catering facilities
  and was hired out, so the trust had no direct involvement with the camp.
  Police said a man, 76, had been arrested at a nearby public house on Monday
  evening on suspicion of administering poison or a noxious thing with intent to
  injure, aggrieve or annoy. The man remains in custody. Neighbours described
  seeing stressed parents outside the village hall on Monday. A 28-year-old
  woman who lives nearby said: “We saw all the ambulances and police cars
  outside. All the kids were very guarded, they would not let anybody near it.
  Everybody was pretty stressed out. There were like four police cars, critical
  care teams, an ambulance, there was quite a lot. It was crazy. The parents
  were pretty stressed, they were here until probably 11pm.” A police
  spokesperson said the force had referred itself to the watchdog, the
  Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), “due to the circumstances of the
  initial police response”. Speaking at the scene, James Avery, an assistant
  chief constable of Leicestershire police, said it was a complex and sensitive
  investigation. He was unable give out further information on the age of
  children, where they were from or the nature of what their illness was. “Other
  than explaining that they came down with symptoms of feeling unwell I’m unable
  to elaborate any further at this stage.” He said “care, compassion and
  support” was being provided to the children. The investigation is being led by
  an East Midlands major incident team. DI Neil Holden, the senior investigating
  officer, said: “We understand the concern this incident will have caused to
  parents, guardians and the surrounding community. We are in contact with the
  parents and guardians of all children concerned. “Please be reassured that we
  have several dedicated resources deployed and are working with partner
  agencies, including children’s services, to ensure full safeguarding is
  provided to the children involved. “We also remain at the scene to carry out
  inquiries into the circumstances of what has happened and to continue to
  provide advice and support in the area. This is a complex and sensitive
  investigation and we will continue to provide updates to both parents and
  guardians and the public as and when we can.” The force said detectives and
  uniformed officers from the Melton and Rutland neighbourhood policing area
  were still in Stathern carrying out further inquiries and seeking to establish
  the circumstances of the incident. They were also “providing reassurance to
  families affected as well as the local community”. The IOPC said: “We received
  a conduct referral on Tuesday from Leicestershire police relating to their
  handling of concerns passed to them over the wellbeing of a group of children.
  “Our assessment team has examined all available evidence and concluded the
  matter should be independently investigated by the IOPC. The investigation
  will look at whether there were any breaches of professional behaviour –
  namely a failure to carry out duties and responsibilities – that resulted in a
  delay in Leicestershire police’s response to what was later declared a
  critical incident.” Edward Argar, the local MP, encouraged the police to
  provide as much information as possible about what happened. He said: “The
  reports of this incident are clearly shocking and deeply concerning. While,
  understandably, people will have a lot of questions about what has happened,
  it is important we remember this is a live police criminal investigation, so I
  would caution against people speculating while the police do that work. “I
  would, however, encourage the police to provide as much information publicly
  as they can, as soon as they can, but without prejudicing that vital
  investigation.” Anyone with any information in relation to the investigation
  is being asked by detectives to report it here.
