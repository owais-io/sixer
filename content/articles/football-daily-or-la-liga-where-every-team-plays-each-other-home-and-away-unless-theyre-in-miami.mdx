  MIAMI TWICE? Spanish football is famed for nothing if not its integrity.
  Whether it’s Franco using his influence to elevate Real Madrid, in general,
  but with particular regard to the Di Stéfano affair; the way the government
  facilitated the sale of Madrid’s training ground for a gazillion euros;
  Barcelona conjuring then pulling their beloved levers; the way it treats the
  women’s game, in general but with particular regard to the Luis Rubiales
  affair; racism more suited to a dissertation or police report than a
  tea-timely email; to say nothing of the Fuentes blood bags. But even La Liga
  has always stayed true to one essential necessity: every team plays every
  other team twice, once at home and once away … until now, with this season’s
  Villarreal v Barcelona match, the Yellow Submissives v Mes Que Un Cash Cow,
  scheduled for Miami. The various suits tried this one a few years ago only for
  US Soccer to block the move citing a Fifa statute forbidding games from being
  scheduled outside their home territory. But since then, Relevent Sports – a
  company that clearly loves the game and, by amazing but unrelated coincidence,
  recently signed a six-year deal to be Uefa’s global marketing and sales
  partner for men’s club competitions – and whose owner, by amazing but
  unrelated coincidence, also owns the Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium – sued both
  official bodies to make more money for themselves. If you’re still reading,
  the case eventually settled with the understanding that Fifa would revisit the
  legislation and, shonuff y’all, as of yesterday they’ve been invited to do so.
  This is because Spanish football has had, for many years, el humpo with the
  Premier League, deeming its financial dominance unfair. This is, of course,
  hilarious – Real Madrid and Barcelona, its two richest institutions, have won
  18 of the last 20 titles with its third-richest, Atlético, claiming the other
  two; Madrid have won five of the last 10 Bigger Cups; and Spanish clubs have
  paid eight of the 20 largest transfer fees of all time – but it is also a
  fact, mid-to-lower ranking Premier League clubs are able to outbid far more
  successful ones from across Europe. The problem, then, is not one of diagnosis
  but of treatment. To improve competitiveness and overall product, Spanish
  football might try to share TV revenue more evenly between clubs, helping make
  the chase for the title actually interesting; authorities could announce
  kick-off times more than 10 minutes before games, allowing more people to
  attend; take serious action against racism and sexism; stop clubs, the richest
  ones included, from living beyond their means; shrink the country so that away
  fans can travel and create atmosphere. Instead, though, Villarreal and
  Barcelona are being sent to the USA USA USA where, presumably, fans will show
  just how much they love and care for the game by putting its needs above their
  own and boycotting such an egregious and competitive disgrace. Football is
  capable of many wondrous things, but what it cannot do is change the history
  and geography of the planet and, though it is possible for people from
  elsewhere to understand the vibe, history and tradition of eastern Spain’s
  Castellón region – all power to them – clubs have names, names which represent
  a place. To take an example entirely at random, Villarreal are called
  Villarreal because they come from Villarreal, play in Villarreal and represent
  Villarreal; to significant extent, they are Villarreal. That’s how it effin’
  well works. So, though it’s brilliant to see this thing of ours traverse the
  world, mankind’s only creation able to cross every border, without that locus,
  no quantity of pounds, euros or dollars can make it worth anything, or mean
  anything. It is not just about what is integrity, but what is integral. QUOTE
  OF THE DAY To Manchester United I decided and said yes. I wanted to join
  Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson … [but Dortmund] could not sell me,
  because they knew if I stayed they could earn more money, and that I could
  wait maybe one or two more years” – Robert Lewandowski on how he almost became
  a Red Devil in 2012, two years after a volcanic ash cloud scuppered a planned
  move to Blackburn Rovers. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink now
  being reduced to doing Strictly Come Dancing is quite depressing but seeing a
  big picture of him smiling is even more unsettling (he should always be stood
  by the corner flag grimacing after smacking a goal into the top corner against
  Arsenal). However, the pièce de résistance, is the quote attributed to him:
  ‘I’m looking forward to tackling a fun challenge! Bring on a new type of
  footwork, with hopefully no own goals’, which was clearly written by a PR
  intern who has no idea who Jimmy is and appears to have never even seen an
  actual game of football” – Noble Francis. Perhaps it’s just as well that you
  didn’t make a pun comparing the Iliad to an intelligence challenging insult
  (yesterday’s Football Daily) as you’ve saved 1,057 readers pointing out that
  Greek poet Homer wrote the Iliad not the Roman poet Virgil” – Rob McPheely. If
  you have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner
  of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Noble Francis. Terms and conditions
  for our competitions, when we run them, can be viewed here.  RECOMMENDED
  LOOKING It’s David Squires on … the Premier League soap opera’s grand return.
  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry
  Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and
  Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry at Troxy in
  London. The pod will also be livestreamed globally. Book now. This is an
