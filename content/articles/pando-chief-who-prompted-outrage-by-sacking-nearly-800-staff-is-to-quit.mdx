  The chief executive described as “Britain’s most hated boss” after sacking
  almost 800 workers at P&amp;O Ferries is to leave the company. Peter
  Hebblethwaite prompted outrage in 2022 after P&amp;O Ferries dismissed 786
  staff and replaced them with low-paid agency workers, who received
  considerably less than the UK minimum wage. At the time the cross-Channel
  ferry company was accused of operating like “pirates of the high sea” and
  during questioning at a parliamentary hearing Darren Jones, then chair of the
  business committee, asked: “Are you in this mess because you don’t know what
  you’re doing, or are you just a shameless criminal?” Hebblethwaite always said
  his actions were the only way of saving the ferry group from going bust. No
  criminal charges were brought after the sackings. A spokesperson for P&amp;O
  Ferries, a subsidiary of the Dubai-based ports operator DP World, said: “Peter
  Hebblethwaite has communicated his intention to resign from his position as
  chief executive officer to dedicate more time to family matters. P&amp;O
  Ferries extends its gratitude to Peter Hebblethwaite for his contributions as
  CEO over the past four years. “During his tenure the company navigated the
  challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, initiated a path towards financial
  stability, and introduced the world’s first large double-ended hybrid ferries
  on the Dover-Calais route, thereby enhancing sustainability. We extend our
  best wishes to him for his future endeavours.” The change of management at
  P&amp;O Ferries, which was first reported by Sky News, follows the company
  wrestling with its governance after twice failing to publish its annual
  accounts on time, which is technically a criminal offence. The ferry
  operator’s 2022 accounts were almost 11 months late when they were belatedly
  published in November last year and showed that the company spent more than
  £47m on jettisoning its UK seafarers. Earlier this year, it emerged that
  P&amp;O had hired a tiny four-person auditing firm to replace KPMG, one of the
  “big four” accountancy firms, which resigned from approving its annual
  accounts in March. When P&amp;O Ferries’ 2023 accounts were finally published
  in July, they revealed that Hebblethwaite had been paid £683,000 in the
  financial year after making the controversial dismissals, a pay rise of at
  least 55% that included a £183,000 bonus. “I reflected on accepting that
  payment, but ultimately I did decide to accept it,” Hebblethwaite told MPs. “I
  do recognise it is not a decision that everybody would have made.” The
  increased remuneration contrasted sharply with the pay that had been received
  by seafarers onboard the company’s ferries. In 2022, the businessman told
  parliamentarians that the lowest-paid agency worker would receive £5.15 an
  hour, only for a Guardian and ITV News investigation in March 2024 to reveal
  how some seafarers were receiving an hourly rate as low as £4.87.
  Hebblethwaite was recalled to appear in front of another select committee
  hearing two months after the expose and conceded that “the lowest, fully
  consolidated hourly pay is about £4.87”. When the Guardian and ITV News had
  previously asked P&amp;O about the £4.87 an hour figure, a spokesperson had
  said: “We do not recognise the pay rates that you are referencing. No member
  of our crew on our Dover-Calais vessels earns less than $2,400 per month,
  equivalent to £5.20 per hour.” The company was able to pay rates considerably
  below the UK minimum wage because maritime workers, employed by an overseas
  agency who work on foreign-registered ships in international waters, were
  exempt from the relevant legislation. As P&amp;O used that specific model, the
  level of pay on board its vessels was legal. However, last year new
  legislation in the UK and France became active. Pay rates are understood to
  have risen onboard P&amp;O vessels since. In its latest accounts, the company
  lost £91.4m before tax in 2023, a considerable improvement on the £249.4m
  losses in 2022. The accounts show that it transported 4.6 million passengers
  in 2023, a 45% reduction on the 8.4 million carried in 2018.
