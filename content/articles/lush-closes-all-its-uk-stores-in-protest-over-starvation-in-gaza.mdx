  The cosmetics retailer Lush has closed its UK shops, factories and website in
  protest over starvation in Gaza. A statement appeared on its website and on
  posters on shop windows on Wednesday, which read: “Stop starving Gaza, we are
  closed in solidarity”, while its flagship spa on London’s Oxford Street was
  marked as “temporarily closed” on Google Maps. In an interview with LBC radio,
  the co-founder Mark Constantine said the company’s estimated losses as a
  result of the closure would be about £300,000. While offering his support for
  the decision, he added: “It would be nice to be able to pay for food to go
  into Gaza, rather than just sacrificing [profits].” The statement released on
  the Lush website asks for customers’ forgiveness for any inconvenience, but
  says that “many of our customers share the same anxiety about the situation in
  Gaza”. It calls on the government to bring an end to “death and destruction”
  as well as stop arms sales to Israel. “The UK government is losing a day of
  tax contributions from Lush,” the statement notes. In 2024, the UK-founded
  luxury cosmetics brand produced 102m products and had a turnover of £690m. It
  operates 869 stores globally, with the most stores in the UK. It says that its
  Palestine-focussed fundraising product, Watermelon Slice soap, has been the
  most successful single fundraising product in its history, with profits going
  towards mental health services for children in Gaza and the West Bank. The
  company has previously taken stands on other issues – it launched a “#Spycops”
  campaign in 2018 to highlight abuses by undercover police officers in the UK,
  and boycotted some social media apps in 2021, citing their negative effects on
  the body image for teenagers. Lush has also sent cheques to direct action
  climate campaigning groups, including RoadBlock and anti-aviation group Clear
  the Skies. However, it opposed the placement of a “Boycott Israel” poster on a
  Dublin store shopfront in October 2023, saying it did not represent the Lush
  ethos that “All Are Welcome. Always.” A spokesperson for Lush told the PA news
  that agency staff were being paid for the closure day. The prime minister last
  month said the UK would recognise a Palestinian state later in September
  unless Israel agrees to meet certain conditions, including addressing the
  humanitarian crisis, implementing a ceasefire and reviving the prospect of a
  two-state solution. In a statement on the Middle East to the House of Commons
  on Monday, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, told MPs Gaza was experiencing
  a “man-made famine” as Israel’s aid restrictions continue.
