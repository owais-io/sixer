  Personal stories are a strong focus in this year’s Baillie Gifford prize for
  nonfiction longlist, with Yiyun Li’s memoir about the loss of her two teenage
  sons by suicide and Barbara Demick’s account of her role reuniting a pair of
  twins separated in China among those recognised. Biographies and narrative
  histories which explore a recent period from a personal perspective also
  dominate the longlist of 12 titles – nine of which were written by
  journalists, including the Guardian writer Jason Burke and the BBC war
  correspondent Lyse Doucet. Eight of the authors are British. The
  Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Burke,
  which draws on his lifetime of reporting for the Guardian as a foreign
  correspondent, is up against The Finest Hotel in Kabul: A People’s History of
  Afghanistan by Doucet, which weaves together the experiences of Afghans who
  have kept the Hotel Intercontinental running since 1969. Judges commended
  Daughters of the Bamboo Grove by Demick, a previous winner of the prize, for
  “humanising” the effects of China’s one-child policy by exposing the families
  torn apart by its implementation. Another longlisted title, How to End a
  Story: Collected Diaries by the Australian writer Helen Garner, was praised
  for candidly chronicling the breakdown of a marriage. Things in Nature Merely
  Grow by Li, a novelist and finalist for the Pulitzer prize, was singled out as
  “unlike any other book on the list” with “beautiful” and “extraordinary”
  writing that led the judges into “the abyss of personal tragedy”. Three
  biographies – of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Muriel Spark and the Beatles – also
  feature on the longlist. The winner of the prize will receive £50,000, with
  the other shortlisted authors – who will be announced on 2 October – receiving
  £5,000 each. This year’s judging panel included the Times literary editor
  Robbie Millen, the historian and author Pratinav Anil, the journalist Inaya
  Folarin Iman, the writer and historian Lucy Hughes-Hallett, the Economist
  culture journalist Rachel Lloyd and the author and biographer Peter Parker.
  Millen, who was the judging chair, said “variety” was the common theme of the
  longlist. “All the judges were impressed, delighted and relieved by the
  mind-quickening variety of the books that we read in terms of style, character
  and subject matter … All of human life can be found in the pages of these 12
  remarkable books,” he said. Judges selected the longlist from more than 350
  nonfiction books published between 1 November 2024 and 31 October 2025. None
  of the writers longlisted this year were debut authors. Frances Wilson makes
  her third appearance on the prize’s longlist for Electric Spark: The Enigma of
  Muriel Spark, which the judges hailed as a “dazzling biography” of the
  novelist’s mind and character, alongside twice shortlisted Richard Holmes for
  The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief. This
  book, which focuses on the poet’s early years and his immersion in scientific
  thought, is a masterful look at “how poets respond to the faith-quaking
  challenge of science”, Millen said. The third biography on the list, John
  &amp; Paul: A Love Story in Songs by Ian Leslie, is an account of the love and
  jealousy between the Beatles which judges found “deeply entertaining and
  enjoyable”. Europe is a focus for three of the other longlisted authors.
  Between the Waves: The Hidden History of a Very British Revolution 1945-2016
  by New Statesman journalist Tom McTague is a “gripping exploration of
  Euroscepticism in Britain”, according to the judges. The Last Days of
  Budapest: Spies, Nazis, Rescuers and Resistance by Adam LeBor “skilfully”
  recreates life and death in Budapest during the second world war, while Adam
  Weymouth’s Lone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe – which documents an
  epic walk by a wolf from Slovenia through the Alps to Italy – was praised by
  the judges for its discussion of conservation and rewilding. The remaining
  book on the longlist is Captives and Companions, which judges described as a
  “thoroughly investigated” book on slavery in the Muslim world, by Justin
  Marozzi, winner of the Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje prize. The
  investment management firm Baillie Gifford has sponsored the prize since 2016.
  Last year’s winner, Richard Flanagan, delayed accepting the £50,000 prize
  money for his book Question 7. In his acceptance speech, he said that he would
  not accept the reward until the fund manager shares a plan to reduce its
  investment in fossil fuel extraction and increase investments in renewables.
  “As each of us is guilty,” the 63-year-old concluded, “each of us too bears a
  responsibility to act: a writer, a fund manager.” Last year, a campaign by
  Fossil Free Books (FFB) highlighted Baillie Gifford’s investments in
  businesses connected to fossil fuels and Israel, leading to its sponsorships
  of nine UK literary festivals coming to an end in June 2024. Baillie Gifford
  continues to sponsor the nonfiction prize, however. Previous winners of the
  prize have included Antony Beevor, Jonathan Coe, Serhii Plokhy, Hallie
  Rubenhold and Katherine Rundell. Browse all the novels on the Baillie Gifford
