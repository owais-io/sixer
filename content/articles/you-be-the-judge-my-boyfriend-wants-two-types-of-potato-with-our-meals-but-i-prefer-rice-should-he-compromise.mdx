  You be the judge: my boyfriend wants two types of potato with our meals, but I
  prefer rice. Should he compromise?

  The prosecution: Noor We split the cooking, so it’s a battle between us as to
  which carb is better. To me, rice is more versatile My boyfriend, Paul, and I
  moved in together five months ago. Since then, a rift has emerged – Paul wants
  potatoes with every meal. Actually, he often wants two types of potatoes with
  his meals – mash and chips, for example, or roasties and mash. I prefer rice.
  We split the cooking, so it’s a continual battle between us: which carb is
  better? Paul is part-Irish and part-Welsh, and says potatoes are part of his
  heritage. But I’m Indian, so the same is true for me about rice. I’ve always
  eaten rice as my carb, even when sharing meals with people from different
  backgrounds. To me, rice isn’t just a side dish, it’s a cornerstone of
  culture, identity, and countless comfort meals and festive feasts. Paul also
  says that potatoes are more versatile, but that’s laughable. Rice can be
  steamed, fried, boiled, fermented, rolled, wrapped, puffed, flaked, and
  transformed into countless dishes like biryani, sushi, sticky mango rice,
  kheer, onigiri and more. It doesn’t need to put on a show to be delicious,
  unlike the potato, which needs loads of salt, breadcrumbs or oil to make it
  great. Rice is the perfect blank canvas to soak up flavour. Paul also says
  rice spikes blood sugar. But I don’t think dauphinois smothered in cream and
  cheese (his favourite form of potato) is exactly a miracle health food.
  Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a
  steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roof. He says, “You can’t have rice with
  that.” But I can and I do. I am more flexible with his meals than he is with
  mine. When he cooks, I have potatoes with whatever we’re having. But I would
  like us to just have one type of potato with our meal, we don’t need two: it’s
  unnecessary and unhealthy. I love Paul, but living with someone who worships
  potatoes as though they’re the eighth wonder of the world is a lot at times.
  He needs to come around to my way of eating. The defence: Paul I made
  thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor pretended she didn’t like
  them I love potatoes, but Noor is obsessed with rice. I can’t stand rice as
  it’s very boring, but I’ve adapted since we started living together. I’m Irish
  and Welsh, so potatoes are in my blood, but Noor says the same about rice. You
  can’t argue with either of us from a cultural perspective. The issue is,
  seeing as I do more of the cooking, I often opt for other carbs before I do
  rice. For me, rice just doesn’t hit the same. Potatoes are the most versatile
  food. They’re both a carb and a vegetable. They are cheap and delicious, and
  there is so much that can be done with them – mash, fries, jacket potatoes,
  dauphinois, croquettes, crisps … the list goes on. Sometimes I like to put two
  types of potato with our dinner – mash and fries, or croquettes and mash – but
  I don’t do it every night. Noor says it’s unhealthy and that I should make
  space for other vegetables, but I disagree. I recently discovered how to cook
  thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor quite liked them, though
  she pretended she didn’t. I don’t mind cooking rice, but it’s a hassle with
  all the water-measuring, and I find it very plain. You have to dress it up to
  make it taste of anything. I have started eating a lot more rice when it’s
  appropriate – with curry, for example – but I don’t believe in having it as a
  standard accompaniment to all our dishes. I don’t think it’s versatile enough.
  Noor, on the other hand, wants rice with things like a roast dinner, or a
  piece of chicken. I think I can make the argument that potatoes are more
  nutritionally balanced in their natural form, and you can do more with them.
  Rice spikes your blood sugar. Potatoes with the skin on are a great source of
  fibre, and it’s not like I fry them all the time. Noor has taught me how to
  make rice since we now live together, so I will try to cook it more because I
  love her. I just want her to come around to my way of thinking and admit that
  potatoes are superior. The jury of Guardian readers Does Paul deserve a
  roasting? I can’t deny that Paul is right that there are so many delicious
  ways of cooking potatoes, and rice with a roast is simply wrong. But two types
  of potato with a meal is one too many for me. Sticking to one and having rice
  some nights seems the obvious answer. Rob, 54 There’s culinary lawbreaking on
  both sides here (double spuds, rice with roast dinner … dear me), so neither
  party can claim the moral high ground. But Paul claiming that “potatoes are
  superior” is ridiculous – Noor obviously doesn’t think so for starters, and
  his lack of awareness puts him in the wrong. Xiang, 37 Noor and Paul are both
  being stubborn. Surely it’s best to compromise and alternate carbs – that
  would keep both of them happy. It’s either that or preparing separate carbs
  for each meal, which would be time-consuming and probably lead to food waste.
  Emma, 26 It’s great that Noor and Paul are both being true to their culinary
  heritages, but Paul needs to compromise. He is wrong to ask Noor to concede
  that potatoes are superior, and should let her spice up traditional meals with
  rice. Alice, 44 As neither of them hates the other’s preferred carb, they
  should switch between rice and potatoes. Paul should accept this, and he
  definitely shouldn’t cook two types of potato – one green veg and one potato
  variety would be far healthier. Valerie, 40 Now you be the judge In our online
  poll, tell us if you think Paul’s argument is half-baked The poll closes on
  Wednesday 10 September at 9am BST Last week’s results We asked whether Billie
  should stop buying kitchen appliances. 32% of you said yes – Billie is guilty
  68% of you said no – Billie is not guilty
