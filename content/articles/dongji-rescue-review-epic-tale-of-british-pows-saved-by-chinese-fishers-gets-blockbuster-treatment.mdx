  blockbuster treatment

  The sinking of the Lisbon Maru, an extraordinary second world war story in
  which 384 British PoWs were saved from a bombed Japanese cargo liner by
  Chinese fishers, has recently been excavated in an exhaustive, emotional
  documentary. In Dongji Rescue, co-directed by Zhenxiang Fei and Guan Hu, this
  staggering tale gets a blockbuster makeover that involves Imax cameras and an
  $80m budget. The film opens with the stunning vista of the eponymous island,
  then under Japanese control. The seeds of discontent are there, as the local
  Chinese population are forbidden from fishing. Still, they endure the
  occupation with grim acceptance. Standing apart from the pack are a pair of
  brothers, Abi (Zhu Yilong) and Adang (Wu Lei), orphans said to descend from
  pirates. Their physical prowess acquires a near superhuman dimension as they
  are shot scaling mountainous terrain and navigating treacherous waters with
  dazzling speed and dexterity. When Adang comes upon a British PoW adrift at
  sea, his discovery and sheltering of the unfortunate man triggers an
  escalation of violence from the Japanese, which ultimately leads to the famed
  rescue mission. However, for a film that retells a stunning feat of humanity
  and compassion, Dongji Rescue feels oddly individualist. Zhu Yilong is
  charismatic as a reluctant saviour with an awakened conscience, yet the
  narrative insistence on a heroic figure dampens the collective potency of the
  actual historical event. The gory depiction of Japanese atrocities also pushes
  the story towards simplistic spectacle. Still, the technical finesse on
  display during the final section, where we see the fearless fishers coming to
  the aid of the PoWs, is stunning to behold. It’s a shame that such virtuosity
  is not reflected in the script, leaving this something of an unmoored epic in
  the sea of state-sponsored films released to commemorate the 80th anniversary
  of China’s war of resistance. • Dongji Rescue is in Australian cinemas now and
  UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August.
