  It might be that they’re cheap. It might be that they’re healthy. But, in all
  likelihood, it’s “because they are just delicious”, says seafood chef Mitch
  Tonks. Whatever the reason, mussels are having a moment. Where once moules
  meant marinière (the classic French dish with white wine and parsley), now you
  can find them skewered, popcorned, pickled, barbecued, and even breaded and
  served in a burger bun. Mussels are making waves not just along the coast of
  Britain but in restaurants and recipes across the land. And they are being
  greeted with growing excitement, too, because, unlike the majority of food
  that becomes a fad, creating spikes in demand that cannot help but damage a
  group of people or their environment, there are no downsides to going mad for
  mussels. They are “a no-brainer”, says Charles Banks, co-founder and director
  of The Food People, the global food trends agency. “It’s not often you get
  those foods that make economic and ecological sense and are delicious as well
  as healthy.” Ask Banks, Tonks or, indeed, anyone who knows anything about
  mussels why they are perfect, and the resulting eulogy is like a bivalve
  version of the sonnet “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways”. “They grow
  quickly, and on their own; they don’t need external feed or chemicals or
  anything. They just naturally feed from their environment,” says Anthony
  Pender, the founder of London seafood restaurant Faber, speaking from Wales
  where he’s visiting one of his mussel suppliers. Câr y Môr is Wales’s first
  regenerative seaweed and shellfish farm, whose goal is to support coastal
  communities and restore the health of the water – and mussels play a vital
  role in both. “They grow on ropes, which are strung up, down and along – the
  perfect example of vertical farming at sea – and they are low-intensity,
  because they require no inputs, create no waste and the generation of their
  shells sequesters carbon from the water. Meanwhile, inside, the bivalve is
  cleaning the water through filter-feeding,” Pender adds, “to the extent there
  is more wildlife in the water now at Câr y Môr than when they started [mussel
  farming] six years ago.” This way of feeding is partly what makes mussels so
  cheap – “They are a genuinely affordable shellfish, which sounds like an
  oxymoron!” laughs Banks – but it is also what makes them so beneficial for the
  coastal environment. In Lyme Bay, where Tonks’ mussels are sourced for his
  Rockfish restaurants in the south-west and for his canned seafood business,
  the bay’s biodiversity has been transformed by careful management and
  mussel-growing ropes, which in 2013 were slung into a seascape decimated by
  decades of destructive fishing. The filter-feeding process by which the
  mussels extract nutrients from the water counteracts the effects of
  eutrophication, caused by the excess run-off of agricultural chemicals.
  Meanwhile, the infrastructure of the ropes, hanging well below the surface of
  the waves and heavy with mussels, creates a reef-like haven, encouraging
  smaller fish to shelter and breed. “They are just a great species,” enthuses
  chef Jamie Savage, who adds to mussels’ list of qualities omega 3 fatty acids,
  vitamins A, B and D, and the fact that their shells can be repurposed in dog
  medicine, chicken food and homeware. So smitten is Savage with mussels, in
  fact, that he’s dedicated his entire restaurant, Savages Mussels, to them: “I
  fell in love with them when I was a kid going to Eurocamp in the school
  holidays. I thought it would be mint to have a restaurant using them in
  different ways.” Savage, the man behind the mussel burger, has even
  incorporated them into a chilli. “I think people associate them with being on
  holiday, so there’s a nostalgia about them, too, which is great – but I wanted
  to teach people about mussels at home. Since opening, I’ve had forty- and
  fiftysomethings coming in saying they’ve never had mussels in Macclesfield
  before!” For years, many British people were wary of mussels – not of moules
  marinière in a French bistro, but of preparing them at home, which feels
  fiddly and fraught with risk. There’s the faff of debearding, and the fear of
  a having a “dodgy” one, which hangs over mussels as it does all bivalves.
  “People are nervous about cooking something live,” Tonks accepts, “but the
  basic rule is, if they stay open when you tap them, discard them, and if they
  don’t open when you cook them, discard them.” The merits of mussels grown on
  ropes in the open water means there is far less likelihood of grit and sand in
  the shells, too, while mussel sourcing and processing has improved greatly in
  recent decades. Besides, debearding is easy. “I posted a video of my
  four-year-old daughter doing this recently,” laughs Ben King, founder of Pesky
  Fish, an online fish market that sources seafood from regenerative sources.
  Since launching Pesky in 2018, King has seen sales of mussels rise steadily,
  in part because customers are seeing them more in restaurants and feel more
  confident about cooking them, but mostly because the average price of more
  popular fish such as hake and sole has rocketed, making mussels an
  increasingly attractive choice. “They are our third-most popular line,” King
  says of his mussels, which are handpicked off beaches in Pembrokeshire and
  cleaned before being reaching homes 20 hours later. Nick Jefferson, founder of
  Wylde Market, another online retailer of regenerative produce, calls them
  “nature’s fast food”. “In the time you have even placed your Deliveroo order,
  let alone waited for it to arrive soggy and cold, you could have prepared and
  cooked mussels,” he points out. “Chillies, wild garlic, sherry – I do all
  sorts, depending on what’s in the cupboard.” Indeed, there have never been so
  many mussel recipes out there. Tonks uses them in place of clams in chowder;
  Nigel Slater pairs them with pasta and dill; Yotam Ottolenghi steams them alla
  vodka, or in a spicy, lapsang souchong broth. “They pair just as well with
  rich, creamy sauces as they do delicate herbs and citruses – and they are a
  perfect vehicle for deeply spiced and layered broths,” says Gurdeep Loyal,
  whose latest book, Flavour Heroes, suggests a “marinière” of yuzu koshō and
  smoky bacon. “The sky’s the limit,” says Matthew Ryle, executive chef of
  Maison François in London. His was one of the first restaurants to make
  mussels a signature dish, with a warm, parsley-buttered flatbread draped with
  mussels that is a homage to “that last, best mouthful of a moules marinière,
  when you dip in the bread to soak up the sauce”. Many other restaurants have
  follow suit, opening with hero mussel dishes such as the moules farcies snack
  at Wildflowers in central London, the asparagus and mussels at Cardinal in
  Edinburgh, or the cherry-glazed barbecued catfish with dried grated mussels at
  Ukrainian restaurant Sino in London. “The quality is better, plus it’s a time
  when chefs and customers are [particularly] conscious of prices, so they are
  more readily accepted than an oyster,” Ryle continues. Thanks to the number of
  sources around the coast, mussels also tend to transcend the seasons, so they
  can remain on the menu year-round. When the southern coast gets too warm for
  mussels to fatten properly, Shetland steps in. “The waters are incredibly
  cold, deep and full of nutrients,” says Scottish restaurateur Stephen Lironi.
  His seafood tapas bar in Soho, Maresco, was born of his wish to support small
  coastal communities in Scotland, for which mussels present a huge economic
  opportunity, and of his learning how much of Scotland’s seafood gets exported,
  particularly to Spain. “The Spanish can’t get enough of mussels,” he says.
  They are fried, then canned, in a variety of sauces, then dished up in tapas
  bars on potato crisps or toast. “They consider tinned mussels a premium
  product,” he continues. Yet in Britain, too, the popularity and availability
  of canned mussels is growing: “We went from a standing start to selling 12,000
  tins a year,” Tonks says of his own tinned mussels, which launched only two
  years ago. Sea Sisters, the only tinned seafood company with a cannery
  actually in Britain (Tonks’ is in Spain) have championed mussels since the
  start: “We chose to launch with them in 2021 because they are, in our eyes,
  the most sustainable protein in the world,” co-founder Charlotte Dawe says.
  “They have always been a top-selling product. We even have customers who are
  vegan say they eat mussels, because they are a sustainable and ethical source
  of protein.” This bivalve veganism, as it’s become known, is premised on the
  fact that oysters and mussels have no centralised, complex nervous system, or
  brain, so it follows that killing and consuming them causes them no (or
  little) suffering. With that knowledge, the only remaining objection to
  mussels seems to float away. They are ethical as well as sustainable, healthy,
  affordable and delicious. Concerns around preparing them, which are arguably
  overstated, are allayed by tins and those supermarket vacuum packs that are a
  good (if overpriced) option for those who want the taste of “fresh” mussels
  without the faff. “Having mussels at home feels like being in a restaurant,
  even though they are easy and cheap,” Ryle says. “We should definitely be
  cooking more of them.” Meanwhile, the pressure to cut costs and provide more
  sustainable, great-value options means that, in restaurants, the mussels trend
  is going nowhere. Banks is right; they are a no-brainer, in every sense of the
  phrase.
