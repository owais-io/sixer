  Motorhome Marilyn review – Michelle Collins’ Monroe lookalike adrift on river
  of no return

  Rarely has the cult of celebrity alighted on someone with the intensity it
  struck Marilyn Monroe. More than 60 years after her death, the blond mop, the
  wafting white dress and that wiggle of a walk continue to inspire imitators.
  EastEnders actor Michelle Collins, making her fringe debut, once came across
  such an acolyte in LA and was fascinated. The woman, in her 60s, pulled up in
  a motorhome and emerged looking just like the star of Some Like It Hot. What
  need for fame, what thirst for attention, what emotional hunger could drive
  such a person? The encounter stayed with her and, with playwright Ben
  Weatherill picking up where her late friend Stewart Permutt left off, she now
  plays Denise, a girl from Southend who has wound up in the US as a 61-year-old
  Monroe lookalike, hustling for loose change as a street entertainer by a
  convenient air vent. In front of an adoring audience, Collins plays Denise
  with a mixture of the hard-bitten and the gullible. Under the direction of
  Alexandra Spencer-Jones, she also does a suitably breathy and sweet-voiced
  rendition of River of No Return, suggesting that with the right breaks, this
  copycat performer could have done all right for herself. For no obvious
  reason, Denise has chosen to tell her life story to her pet snake. And what a
  dismal tale it is. The script is a litany of letdowns, exploitation, unwanted
  pregnancy, dead-end gigs, spiced up with one unlikely melodramatic twist. It
  aspires to be tragic but comes across as plain miserable. It would be one
  thing if these were the backstage anecdotes of a real actor, quite another for
  them to be fictional. Why spend time with such a lost and deluded person? My
  performance was interrupted moments before the fiery denouement by someone
  falling ill, but it would take more than a dramatic ending to elevate such a
  dreary play. • At the Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 25 August. • All our
  Edinburgh festival reviews
