  News Corp, part of the Murdoch family media empire, has announced it will
  bring a version of the brash rightwing New York City tabloid the New York Post
  to California in early 2026 with the launch of a daily Los Angeles-based
  newspaper called the California Post. According to New York Post Media Group –
  a News Corp subsidiary and home of New York’s biggest tabloid, as well as Page
  Six and Decider – the California Post will look and feel similar to its New
  York counterpart, delivering reporting, sports coverage and celebrity gossip
  from a California perspective. It will have a team of editors, reporters and
  photographers based in the state, and its content will live across a new set
  of dedicated digital channels and a daily print newspaper that will echo the
  New York Post’s signature cover style. News Corp veteran Nick Papps, a
  longtime editor at the corporation’s Australian operation, has been named
  editor-in-chief of the California Post, reporting to Keith Poole, the New York
  Post’s editor-in-chief. “California is the most populous state in the country,
  and is the epicenter of entertainment, the AI revolution and advanced
  manufacturing – not to mention a sports powerhouse,” Poole said in a
  statement. “Yet many stories are not being told, and many viewpoints are not
  being represented.” It comes at a trying time for news outlets in the Los
  Angeles area. The storied Los Angeles Times, the state’s biggest paper and
  once one of the most influential regional outlets in the US, lost more than
  20% of its newsroom last January, months after laying off 74 staffers amid
  advertising declines in 2023. On top of losing tens of millions of dollars a
  year, it also suffered controversy and subscription losses after its owner
  blocked an endorsement of Kamala Harris in last year’s election. One of Rupert
  Murdoch’s flagship papers, the New York Post, meanwhile, has remained
  profitable, and already has a large and established readership in California.
  The Los Angeles area is home to the second-largest concentration of Post
  readers, according to News Corp, and the vast majority (90%) of the Post’s
  digital readership lives outside of New York. It comes at a critical time for
  a US state very much on the dual frontlines of the climate crisis, with
  extreme weather driving ever more common and increasingly devastating
  wildfires and a huge rebuilding effort needed after January’s fires in the Los
  Angeles area, and the Trump administration’s aggressive anti-immigrant agenda.
  The launch of the California Post has also been timed to coincide with a
  high-profile period for the Bay Area and LA with elections due to be held in
  2026, including for California governor, and the state set to host matches
  during next year’s Fifa World Cup, and LA to host the Summer Olympics in 2028.
  “Los Angeles and California surely need a daily dose of The Post as an
  antidote to the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated,” said
  Robert Thomson, News Corp CEO. “We are at a pivotal moment for the city and
  the state, and there is no doubt that The Post will play a crucial role in
  engaging and enlightening readers, who are starved of serious reporting and
  puckish wit.”
