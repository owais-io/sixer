  As someone who has always been against austerity, I find France, with a
  national debt at 114% of GDP and a budget deficit of 5.8% of GDP, a conundrum.
  Despite years of denunciation from his left and far-right opponents that
  Macron has engaged in “ultraneoliberalism”, there hasn’t been any. Not on a
  macro level, anyway, where both French government spending (57.3% of GDP) and
  tax receipts (51.4% of GDP) are among the highest in the world, including
  social spending, which outpaces any of its European neighbours. At the same
  time, it’s impossible to have spent the past decade in France without
  encountering the widely shared perception and accusation that public services
  are in decline. Doctors and nurses denounce a labour shortage in public
  hospitals; people who live in rural areas denounce the closing of rural train
  lines; students and academics denounce a lack of resources for public
  universities, many of which are dealing with outdated infrastructure, and for
  research. Some of the responses to this aren’t strictly financial. Nearly
  every country in the world is dealing with a shortage of medical personnel,
  which in France has been exacerbated by caps on medical school admissions that
  were finally lifted in 2020. And over the past 25 years, France has seen an
  increase in urbanisation, from 76% to 82%. Maintaining the same level of
  transportation and other services to shrinking rural towns and villages would
  mean far higher spending per person than for those who live in cities,
  ultimately diverting resources from something (whatever, and wherever, that
  is) and raising a fundamental question of fairness. The French, for their
  part, see the downside to the concentration of policymaking in Paris and
  overwhelmingly want more decentralisation. Nevertheless, somehow in a country
  that spends a greater percentage of its budget than any other on all of these
  areas combined, there’s not enough money for anyone, and most are – unlike
  their Nordic peers – to some extent, dissatisfied. And the debt and deficit,
  of course, spiral into unsustainable levels. What, then, is going on? The far
  right blames immigration and promotes a spurious narrative that asylum seekers
  are to blame for the strain on social services and public resources. The
  centrist prime minister, François Bayrou, wants to nibble at the edges with
  cuts to everything, to find €44 billion a year in savings, culminating in the
  absurd proposal to do away with two public holidays (a self-destructive
  political act so outlandish that I originally, and wrongly, I guess, assumed
  it was only suggested to be sacrificed in figure negotiations). The left, for
  its part, somewhat more reasonably argues for taxing wealth, while in practice
  potentially extending the proposed tax increase even to people making over
  €20,584 a year and remaining unmoved by the legitimate complaint that
  self-employed workers, entrepreneurs, small business owners and startups are
  slammed by paperwork and the administrative costs of expanding. In the midst
  of the disagreement over what to do about France’s finances – a debate that
  threatens to bring down the current French government when Bayrou holds a
  confidence vote on 8 September – almost nobody is having an honest
  conversation about the single largest component of the French government’s
  discretionary spending: the €211bn spent every year subsidising businesses to
  create jobs in a country where letting go of workers is difficult and costly,
  and where businesses are, as a result, hesitant to hire. France has created an
  unnecessarily rigid labour market (notice periods can reach up to two to three
  months), has ended up with an unemployment rate persistently higher than the
  EU average and salaries that are not progressing fast enough to keep anyone
  content, and spends €211bn (that is, more than on education) trying to
  compensate. If France instead pursued Danish-style “flexicurity”, how much of
  that €211bn might otherwise be split between cutting the deficit and boosting
  health, education and green energy infrastructure? Let me get something on the
  record before I am inevitably misunderstood. Not every euro of this should be
  castigated: the French model of heavy state intervention in the economy is far
  from being misplaced. It’s one reason why, for all its problems, France
  maintains what may be Europe’s only “full spectrum” economy, from agriculture
  to AI. And if anything, it is proving to be more and more relevant as the
  order of the day; this has always been the way that China functioned, and it’s
  increasingly the way that the US is functioning. Capitalism needs direction.
  As just one example, in undirected capitalism, we end up with a confounding
  situation where different geographies race to the bottom to draw investment in
  datacentres that are inevitably powered by new gas turbines and drain local
  water resources, rather than seeing regulation and incentives direct all of
  them to Iceland, where they could be powered by its more-than-sufficient
  geothermal energy (and the gains distributed). In the deeply imperfect past,
  some of this “direction” was provided by internationally agreed rules and
  treaties, which allowed small states to be nimble and dynamic. This has given
  way to a new world where nations – or a club of nations – of sufficient size
  can be protectionist externally and thus allow for nimble dynamism and
  innovation within their own internal rules. France’s problem is thus one of
  scale. It, like every other European nation, is too small to provide such
  protective external walls – a task that must fall to the EU. At least, should
  European leaders finally accept that the old world they cling to is not coming
  back. The EU cannot succeed in its current form in a world of power rather
  than rules, and where the US and China view geopolitics and economics
  holistically and don’t hesitate to throw their weight in one area behind their
  interests in another. The EU can, on the other hand, succeed if it adapts a
  classically French approach. It’s not just that France needs a wealth tax,
  it’s that the EU needs one; it’s not just that the French space agency needs
  more funding, it’s that the European Space Agency does; it’s not just that
  France should invest more in green energy, it’s that the EU as a whole needs
  energy independence through renewables. The irony is that Europe won’t be
  pushed in this direction unless France has the heft to nudge it there. And to
  do that, France needs an economy that is performing and a political class
  capable of having an honest and long-term conversation, rather than
  scapegoating, gimmicks, or same old, same old. Alexander Hurst is a Guardian
