  The organisation behind the age assurance technology trial that will inform
  how to keep under-16s off social media has frozen out key stakeholders amid
  media leaks and resignations of two members. The trial’s Iain Corby has also
  downplayed reporting about inaccuracies with the facial estimation technology
  – one of the technologies tested in the trial – arguing that it can still be
  used even if it is out by seven years. The $6.5m age assurance technology
  trial, run by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), tested
  various types of technology that could be used by social media platforms and
  adult websites to keep out under-16s or under-18s, respectively, when
  Australia’s under-16s social media ban comes into force in December. The
  project provided its final report to the communications minister, Anika Wells,
  at the start of August. The final report is expected to run to 10 volumes and
  2,500 pages. However, the stakeholder advisory board for the trial – which
  comprises tech companies, child safety advocates, academics and privacy
  advocates – may not see the final report until Wells releases it in the coming
  weeks. Two sources close to the board told Guardian Australia the board was
  not expected to be provided with a copy before then due to leak concerns. When
  the trial was announced, the project plan noted that transparency was key to
  ensuring public trust in the project. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The
  programme needs to be completed with transparency and ensuring the credibility
  and confidence of participants, the commissioning department and the
  Australian public,” the plan stated. Initially, detailed minutes for the
  stakeholder meetings were published online outlining disagreements and
  concerns raised by those involved. But the last several meeting minutes have
  not been posted, and that is expected to continue for the final meeting as the
  report is released. The group behind the trial did not publicise that the
  report had been handed to government, apart from a blog post on the trial’s
  website. Two members of the advisory board have also quit. Guardian Australia
  confirmed that the Electronic Frontiers Australia chair, John Pane, resigned
  from the board last week, following another resignation reported earlier by
  Crikey. In a statement issued last week, Pane criticised the preliminary
  report findings from June – where the project team claimed that age assurance
  technology could be “private, robust and effective” – as “strong on hype and
  rhetoric, and difficult to reconcile with the evidence”. “These political
  talking points seem to be a case of ‘selling the sizzle and not the steak’– or
  perhaps even ‘privacy washing’,” Pane said. He argued that assessment of the
  privacy practices of some vendors amounted to checking if the vendor had a
  privacy policy, and was a “tick-box compliance” exercise. Pane also said the
  trial organisers had not confirmed whether the vendors who participated in the
  trial will permanently de-identify all personal data collected from test
  subjects. Tim Levy, the managing director of children’s safety technology
  company Qoria, resigned from the trial earlier this year. Levy said the
  voracity of the conclusions of the interim report were “not going to match
  community expectations and I believe my team of 600 dedicated cybersafety
  professionals would not like us to be associated with such an unsafe report”.
  ACCS’s chief executive, Tony Allen, said Pane’s contribution and the work of
  the board was welcomed but he said all of the points raised “have been
  addressed in the full report – and in some considerable depth”. “It is partly
  because of those points that it is taking some time to prepare the report (and
  perhaps more so, the supporting materials) for publication.” Allen said all
  data has been anonymised and the personally identifiable information deleted.
  He said the trial continues to engage with the board and is working for the
  next meeting. Allen said a gap in publication of meeting minutes was “no
  conspiracy” but a “factor of preparation for publication, which takes some
  time”. Corby, who is responsible for stakeholder engagement for the trial and
  is also the executive director of the Age Verification Providers Association,
  told a podcast published on the industry research and consultancy website
  Biometrics Update last month that people “need to be patient and get the full
  10 volumes [of the report] in the public domain, and then it will be a lot
  clearer what the trial has found”. He said the report will be a “bible of
  data” that will be “quoted around the world”. “[The report] is albeit done by
  Age Check Certification Scheme, who are known in the sector, but with very
  close scrutiny from an advisory board and ethics panel, the government
  themselves in Australia, [and] Prof Toby Walsh providing independent review of
  the evaluation approach,” Corby said. “So it’s been done with a lot of
  discipline around its independence and validity.” In June, the ABC reported
  that tests of facial age estimation technology had estimated a 16-year-old
  being as old as 37. Corby dismissed this report, stating that errors in age
  estimation don’t undermine the whole project of age assurance. “You’re always
  going to have what we call a buffer age, and that might be three years or it
  might need to be five. Or for one provider, it might be three, and for a
  provider with a poorer quality algorithm, it might be seven in order to
  achieve the same level of accuracy overall,” he said on the podcast. “But that
  doesn’t mean to say you have to give up on the social media minimum age bill
  in Australia because one particular category of technology doesn’t give you an
  exact answer.” Corby told Crikey this week the trial would not comment until
  the final report is released.
