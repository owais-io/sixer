  The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced on Wednesday the
  creation of a West Coast Health Alliance aimed at safeguarding access to
  vaccines, amid growing turmoil at the nation’s top public health agency under
  the leadership of Robert F Kennedy Jr. In a joint press release, Governors
  Gavin Newsom of California, Tina Kotek of Oregon, and Bob Ferguson of
  Washington said the CDC had become a “political tool that increasingly peddles
  ideology instead of science”. “President Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors
  and scientists – and his blatant politicization of the agency – is a direct
  assault on the health and safety of the American people,” the Democratic
  governors said in a joint statement, adding: “California, Oregon, and
  Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.” The
  move comes days after the White House forced out the newly confirmed director
  of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, who had
  clashed with Kennedy, Trump’s secretary of the US health and human services
  department (HHS), over his efforts to reshape federal vaccine policies in ways
  that contradict established scientific research. Her firing, just weeks after
  her confirmation, prompted several senior officials to resign in protest and
  has led to rising calls from lawmakers, scientists and former agency employees
  for Kennedy to step down. Monarez was replaced by a Trump loyalist with no
  medical or scientific background. He argued that the organization’s
  “dysfunction” was responsible for “irrational policy” during the Covid
  pandemic, leading to a disproportionately large number of deaths recorded in
  the US compared with the global average. In a statement, an HHS spokesperson
  Andrew Nixon, blamed Democrats’ response to the Covid-19 pandemic for
  undermining public trust in vaccine policy, and said federal immunization
  recommendations would continue to be “based on rigorous evidence and Gold
  Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic”. “Democrat-run
  states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and
  draconian vaccine passports during the Covid era completely eroded the
  American people’s trust in public health agencies,” he said. The newly formed
  West Coast Health Alliance will coordinate health guidance across the three
  states, including evidence-based immunization recommendations. Officials say
  the effort is intended to provide residents with access to consistent and
  credible information about vaccines in the absence of reliable federal
  leadership. According to the announcement, the alliance will release a set of
  shared principles in the coming weeks. While the states will share
  immunization recommendations, they will also pursue independent strategies
  based on their “unique laws, geographies, histories, and peoples” and with
  respect to Tribal sovereignty. The three states registered their concern over
  Kennedy’s leadership in June, when they jointly condemned his abrupt removal
  of all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices –
  a group long considered central to vaccine safety oversight. In announcing the
  new alliance, the governors said they were acting to protect the health of the
  tens of millions of residents across California, Oregon and Washington,
  pledging that public health guidance would be shaped by “science-driven
  decision-making”. Without consistent, evidence-based leadership from the
  federal government, they warned, the nation’s health security was increasingly
  at risk. Their action comes on the same day as more than 1,000 past and
  present HHS employees published a letter calling for Kennedy’s resignation. It
  comes two days after nine former CDC officials wrote in a New York Times guest
  essay that Kennedy’s leadership, and ousting of Monarez, months after he
  appointed her, was “unacceptable” and “unlike anything we have ever seen”. It
  also marks a stark departure from some Republican-led states that have moved
  to loosen – or eliminate entirely – certain vaccine mandates. On Wednesday,
  the Florida state surgeon general announced that children will no longer be
  required to receive vaccines against preventable diseases including measles,
  mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis. And earlier this summer, a new law
  took effect in Idaho removing the requirement for children to be vaccinated to
  attend schools in the state. Public health officials in California, Oregon and
  Washington warned of an erosion of trust in vaccines. “Our communities deserve
  clear and transparent communication about vaccines – communication grounded in
  science, not ideology,” Sejal Hathi, the director of the Oregon health
  authority, said in a statement. “Vaccines are among the most powerful tools in
  modern medicine; they have indisputably saved millions of lives. But when
  guidance about their use becomes inconsistent or politicized, it undermines
  public trust at precisely the moment we need it most.”
