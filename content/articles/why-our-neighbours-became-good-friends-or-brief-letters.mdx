  Emma Beddington’s observations on neighbours (I don’t believe we’re a nation
  of neighbours at war – despite what the headlines say, 31 August) are timely
  and sad. This week, we say goodbye to our lovely neighbours of 19 years. We
  became friends the day they arrived, in spite of an age difference of some 20
  years. Could the key to our friendship be that, in response to a tentative
  inquiry on that first day, we discovered that we were all Guardian readers?
  Good luck, Nick and Amy, please stay in touch. Alistair and Angela Taylor York
  • The examples of newspeak (Letters, 1 September) reminded me of a classic
  Monty Python example of stringing such verbiage together: “I think all
  right-thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being told that
  ordinary, decent people are fed up in this country with being sick and tired.
  I’m certainly not! And I’m sick and tired of being told that I am.” Phil
  Coughlin Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear • Re matching newspapers with
  growing crops (Letters, 31 August), the European must have been very good for
  french beans, brussels and even swedes. And Professional Boatbuilder might be
  good for leeks. Richard Barnard Wivenhoe, Essex • My fellow allotment holder
  always lines his potato trench with the Express newspaper. This not only helps
  water retention, it also provides a faster crop. Terry Mckeown Maryport,
  Cumbria • How long before there is a divorce citing a chatbot as the third
  party (Report, 30 August)? Hilary Bird Kilndown, Kent • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
