  Pick of the week The Room Next Door Pedro Almodóvar’s latest divided the
  critics at last year’s Venice film festival – though not the jury, who awarded
  it the Golden Lion. Some felt his first English-language feature awkwardly
  transplanted his Hispanic melodrama to a Manhattan setting, in which
  terminally ill war photographer Martha (Tilda Swinton) reaches out to her old
  friend, bestselling author Ingrid (Julianne Moore). Others reckoned it was
  just as lush and seductive as ever, a third entry after Pain and Glory and
  Parallel Mothers in a death-preoccupied run of work. What can’t be disputed is
  how it rages against the dying of the light, both on a personal and planetary
  level, led by a cadaverous Swinton orchestrating her own exit. Sunday 3
  August, 7.35am, 10.10pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** The Thicket Peter Dinklage
  heads up this impressively bleak neo-western, as a bounty hunter on the trail
  of a kidnapped girl. Ostensibly in the same redemptive vein as The Searchers,
  it’s closer in flinty spirit to something like The Revenant. His high body
  count decorating the snowy wilderness, Dinklage is as formidable as usual –
  but almost outmatched by Juliette Lewis as Cut Throat Bill, the misleadingly
  named varmint he’s pursuing. Director Elliott Lester goes in hard on seedy
  saloon atmospherics and a Darwinian survivalist vibe. Saturday 2 August,
  9.20am, 6.05pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** Cairo Conspiracy Where many films have
  dwelt on papal intrigue, this is a rare and gripping glimpse into the Islamic
  equivalent from Swedish-Egyptian director Tarik Saleh – the Muslim version of
  Conclave. A young fisherman and aspiring clergyman (played by Tawfeek Barhom)
  is caught up in the deadly power struggle during the election of a new grand
  imam at Cairo’s Al-Azhar University. The second in Saleh’s
  soon-to-be-completed trilogy of unstinting films about the exercise of power
  in Egypt, Cairo Conspiracy is a finely tuned thriller and cynical in the very
  best of ways. Saturday 2 August, 9.30pm, BBC Four *** Kensuke’s Kingdom A
  stirring, classy adaptation, scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce, of the Michael
  Morpurgo novel about a shipwrecked child who encounters a Japanese war veteran
  on a remote island. Recalcitrant lad Michael (voiced by Aaron McGregor) is
  bugging his parents on their sailing trip – but once washed ashore with his
  dog, learns his place in the scheme of nature courtesy of the enigmatic
  Kensuke (Ken Watanabe). With its rich hand-drawn animation, it hews close to
  the purist likes of The Red Turtle – without an anthropomorphised talking
  animal in sight. Sunday 3 August, 3.35pm, BBC One *** The Killers Dirty Harry
  director Don Siegel’s 1964 remake of the 1946 noir classic strips away the
  shadowy romanticism of the high noir era and streamlines it into a lean heist
  pic. It starts with headstone-faced hitman Charlie (Lee Marvin) set to
  assassinate former race-car champion Johnny North (John Cassavetes). Deemed
  too violent to be shown on TV as originally planned, its unvarnished mayhem
  and brisk direction looked ahead to the gritty urban crime epics of the coming
  decade. Sunday 3 August, 9pm, Legend Xtra *** September 5 More purposeful than
  Munich, Steven Spielberg’s 2005 film on the same subject, Tim Fehlbaum’s
  thriller is a journalist’s-eye perspective on the killing of 11 Israeli
  athletes by a Palestinian terror group at the 1972 Olympics. Peter Sarsgaard
  is the ABC sports president intent on milking the unfolding horror for higher
  ratings, Ben Chaplin his more circumspect head of operations focused on the
  human cost. Filmed in fluent Paul Greengrass-style docudramese, it leaves just
  one question to the viewer: the relevancy to current events in the Middle
  East. Thursday 7 August, 7.50am, 9.50pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** Radio Days
  Moral panics over technology aren’t anything new: radio is the
  youth-corrupting influence in Woody Allen’s chirpy 1987 comedy, filling the
  head of narrator Joe (voiced by the director and played by Seth Green) with
  revved-up superhero fantasies. But that’s only one aspect of its communal
  power here, connecting human lives in a string of vignettes uniting Joe’s
  Jewish and radio families (Dianne Wiest, as his lovelorn aunt Bea, and Mia
  Farrow as an aspiring announcer, are the respective standouts) in 30s and 40s
  Rockaway Beach. Thursday 7 August, 11.10pm, Talking Pictures TV • This article
  was amended on 1 August 2025. An earlier version misnamed the actor Julianne
  Moore as “Juliette”.
