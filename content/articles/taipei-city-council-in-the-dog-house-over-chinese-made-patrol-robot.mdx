  Taipei City council has come under fire after admitting that a robot dog it
  bought to help patrol city streets using surveillance cameras was made by a
  Chinese companylinked to the Chinese military. Hammer Lee, the deputy mayor of
  Taiwan’s capital, introduced a “new patrol partner” for the management and
  repair of pedestrian areas in a post on Facebook on Tuesday. “This robot,
  equipped with an optical panoramic survey system, can create 360-degree
  images, accurately locate facilities, and even automatically report missing
  items,” Lee said, noting its ability to “accumulate comprehensive data”. On
  Wednesday, an opposition councillor, Chien Shu-pei, said she had learned that
  the robot had been made by Unitree, a fast-growing robotics startup based in
  the Chinese city of Hangzhou. Unitree’s humanoid robots have appeared in the
  official lunar new year gala and at the recent humanoid robot games in
  Beijing, and its founder and CEO, Xingxing Wang, has met China’s leader, Xi
  Jinping. Earlier this year a US congressional committee said Unitree’s robots
  were “dual use” tech, marketed as civilian but also used in Chinese military
  drills and police operations. Chien said the council’s procurement of a
  Unitree robot dog had “crossed the red line of information and national
  security”. “[This] is no different from sending a Chinese Trojan horse into
  the daily lives of citizens in Taipei City,” Chien wrote on Facebook. In a
  statement, the council’s new works division said it had bought only one robot,
  via a subcontractor, as a trial for maintenance inspections, and that while it
  was made by Unitree in China, the camera system was developed by the Taiwanese
  contractor Supratech. The statement said the new works division would
  “prioritise clearing the security concerns before any further step is taken”.
  A Unitree robot mounted with Taiwan-built camera systems was displayed at a
  Taipei tech trade show last year. China’s ruling Communist party claims Taiwan
  as Chinese territory, and is preparing to annex it, by military force if
  necessary. In the meantime, it barrages Taiwan with near daily grey-zone
  harassment, espionage and cyber-attacks. Taiwan has enacted strict laws and
  regulations about the importation and use of Chinese technology and equipment.
  Comments under Chien’s social media post were fiercely critical of the city
  authorities. “I could instantly tell that the model is from Unitree. The
  Taipei City government has zero awareness on information security,” said one
  commenter. Another asked: “Are you collecting data and paving a way for the
  PLA to conduct urban warfare here?”. The Taiwanese military commentator Wang
  Cheng-ming urged the city government to be more cautious about using Chinese
  technology, noting there were domestic projects in development that could be
  used instead. “Crucial” mapping data gathered by the robot, which could not be
  obtained through satellite or photographs, would be highly sought after by
  China’s military, he added. Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, asked by local
  media about national security concerns over the robot, said the city and
  central governments would be discussing the “innovative experiment”.
