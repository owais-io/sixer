  This photograph is named Man in a Three-piece Suit Dancing Within the Circle
  at a Wedding, Rockville Centre, NY, March 1976. The bride was Elaine Sherman,
  mother of my friend Rhonda, who I’d known since seventh grade. Mrs Sherman was
  getting married for the second time and the dancing man was the husband’s
  son-in-law, though I don’t remember his name or what he was dancing to. As the
  title says, it’s a circle dance, where people get into the middle and do their
  thing. And this guy sure did – he was marvellous. I saw him and just grabbed
  my camera – boom! I was using a pretty wide-angle lens and a head-on flash: I
  like to have people all lit up, like stage lighting. All the way to the left
  of the picture is a woman with just part of her face showing – that’s my mom,
  Sunny, who was friendly with Elaine. I wonder now how I came to be looking
  down at the guy, because I’m only 5ft 1in. Was I standing on a stool or a
  chair? I doubt I’d have done that. I must have been holding the camera at some
  elevation. Usually I ask permission to take a picture, but people knew I was
  photographing. And Elaine was aware that I’d grown up taking pictures of my
  Jewish family and friends in Long Island, and was working on a series focusing
  on that community. I included this picture when I successfully applied for an
  artist grant to become a photographer documenting Jewish New York – which I
  did between 1978 and 1979. The year after I took this picture, I registered
  for a class taught by the Magnum photographer Bob Adelman. He told me about a
  Valentine’s Day party at New York’s Copacabana nightclub: the Coyote Hookers’
  Masquerade Ball. Coyote was an acronym for Cast Off Your Old Tired Ethics, and
  I went dressed as a girl scout and talked my way in with my camera. Since
  moving to New York in my early 20s in 1975, I’d spent a lot of time exploring
  and photographing the club scene, but that one really got me hooked – the
  costumes, the dance, the decor, the amazing sound system. Soon after I met an
  adventurous, fun-loving woman called JudiJupiter on a bus back from Mardi Gras
  and we started hitting the clubs together: Studio 54, Paradise Garage and so
  many others. I’d often take my camera. So this photograph is a cross between
  my suburban home pictures and the club ones – it captures the excitement of
  nightlife. I think I do nightlife with a street photographer’s eye, in that I
  like to capture unexpected action. I don’t usually go places to take
  photographs, I photograph where I’m going. I had to cut right back on clubbing
  when I started teaching in Brooklyn in 1981. The photographs I took there over
  the years were the basis for my first monograph, which I didn’t publish until
  2014. People commented on how full of life the people in those pictures
  appeared, even though the neighbourhood was so burnt out and destitute, but
  the people I’m always attracted to photographing are those who project
  confidence and joy. There’s so much misery and unfairness in the world and so
  many hard lives. Personally, I want to capture the reasons people want to go
  on – I’m drawn to the dandelion coming through the concrete. I do have a
  vintage print of this picture, which means at the time I found it interesting
  enough to print, which was quite unusual back then. It did eventually appear
  in my book Purgatory and Paradise: Sassy ’70s Suburbia and The City. It feels
  like a transitional photograph that combines my interests – family and
  friends, a celebration of life, dance and joy, unexpected talent. I can
  imagine this man standing around at the wedding, looking like a mild-mannered
  guy, and then, wow! What a dancer. • Meryl Meisler’s photography is included
  in She Sells Seashells at Alice Austen House, New York, from 6 September to 21
  February Meryl Meisler’s CV Born: South Bronx, New York City, 1951 Trained:
  “With Cavalliere Ketchum at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, then with
  Lisette Model in New York (and many workshops over the years).” Influences:
  “Diane Arbus, Jacques Henri Lartigue, my dad Jack and my grandfather Murray
  Meisler. Also Brassaï, Helen Levitt and Cartier-Bresson.” High point: “I’ve
  had many. Group and solo exhibits in the US and abroad, gallery
  representation, grants, fellowships, books and positive press are each a
  joyful new high to me. I take nothing for granted and am grateful for each
  opportunity. I believe that the best is yet to come for my career.” Low point:
  “I was one of three finalists for a central permanent installation at a subway
  station with the Metropolitan Transit Authority. During lunch while working as
  a teacher, I received the rejection email. Luckily no one was in my classroom
  at the time because I broke down in tears, sobbing on the floor.” Top tips: “I
  am not a commercial photographer – I am answering this from the viewpoint of a
  photographer who made the bulk of their living as an educator and now
  frequently exhibits in galleries, museums and sells limited edition prints. •
  First and foremost, never give up! The fact that you love taking and making
  photographs is enough reason to keep doing it. • Feeling stuck? Take a class
  or workshop. • Find role models and a supportive community of artists who
  encourage one another in a competitive, often cut-throat world. • You don’t
  want to be remembered as an ‘Unknown Artist’. Print, sign, date and store your
  best work using archival methods. Before you know it, you have vintage prints.
  • Health and wellbeing come first.”
