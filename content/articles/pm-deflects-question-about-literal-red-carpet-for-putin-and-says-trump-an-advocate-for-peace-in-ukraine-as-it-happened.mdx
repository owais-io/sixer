  With that, we’re wrapping up the blog. Before we go, here are the major
  stories from today: Four arrests have been made after clashes between people
  attending a Women Will Speak rally and those who took part in a counter
  demonstration supporting transgender rights in the Melbourne CBD on Saturday;
  An earthquake has struck the Indonesia island of Sulawesi; The Sydney fish
  market roof will light up future events with its roof lighting system being
  taken for a test drive; Discussions are under way about when a EV user road
  charge may be introduced by the federal government; Coalition’s Tim Wilson has
  reiterated his party’s support for Ukraine to be involved in any decision
  about its future; Prime minister Anthony Albanese says Russia cannot be
  rewarded for its war of aggression in Ukraine. We’ll pick things up again
  tomorrow. Housing auction market performing strongly Auction activity is
  warming up with 1,972 auctions to be held, this weekend. That’s more than the
  1,587 auctions held last week but less than the 2,065 held this time last
  year. Based on results collected so far, Cotality’s summary found that the
  preliminary clearance rate was 75% across the country, compared with a 71.7%
  preliminary rate recorded last week but above the 68.7% actual rate on final
  numbers and the 64.8% at the same time last year. Across the capital cities:
  Sydney: 548 of 720 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 75%
  Melbourne: 728 of 961 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 75.5%
  Brisbane: 92 0f 137 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 69.6%
  Adelaide: 50 of 90 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 78% Canberra:
  36 of 52 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 80.6% Tasmania: One
  auction to be held. Perth: Six of eleven auctions held. Productivity to
  dominate agenda as economic symposium begins After weeks of build up, one of
  the biggest events on Australia’s economic calendar is about to begin as the
  government seeks answers to the country’s weak productivity. On Tuesday,
  Treasurer Jim Chalmers will finally convene his economic reform roundtable.
  Heavyweights in the field, such as former Treasury secretary Ken Henry,
  consumer watchdog chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb, Australian Council of Trade Unions
  secretary Sally McManus and Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran
  Blackwill meet in Canberra for three days to discuss ways to lift Australia’s
  living standards. Productivity will be the primary focus but the forum will
  also discuss ways to build resilience and strengthen the budget. The federal
  government has been promoting the event for weeks as stakeholders submitted
  ideas to reinvigorate the economy. Ideas from property investor tax break cuts
  to AI and environmental law reform have been floated but Chalmers has reined
  in expectations of animmediate shake-up of the economy. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, says his government is “unashamedly open” to ideas, but
  major changes in some areas such as tax policy have already been ruled out. –
  AAP Salmon industry investigation ordered amid disease concerns The Tasmanian
  Liberal party has promised to pause salmon farm expansion and instigate an
  independent review of the industry as it attempts to win support from
  crossbench MPs and survive a no-confidence motion in the state parliament this
  week. In a concession to independent MPs critical of salmon farms operating in
  public waterways, the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, today said he supported the
  industry but said it was “on notice” after a mass mortality event last summer.
  He said it must “operate transparently and responsibly and meet its
  obligations to the community”. Rockliff said also the government would respond
  by introducing a marine environment act to strengthen regulation of the
  industry and order a study by an “off-island specialist organisation”. The
  industry can’t expand until that study is done, he said. We know how important
  transparency is to the industry so we expect them to fully participate in the
  study. Our government would want to see from this study practical reforms and
  smarter regulations that protect our environment, but also investment
  certainty for industry. For more on this story read the full report by
  Guardian Australia’s Adam Morton: Islamophobia on the rise in Australia, most
  incidents not reported, report says The Islamic Council of Victoria has
  reported an increase in Islamophobia, warning that the number of victims is
  likely far higher than reported. On Saturday, the council held its first
  conference on Islamophobia, with politicians, police, religious leaders and
  academics among attending the event in Melbourne. More than 85% of
  Islamophobia incidents are not reported, according to a report released to
  coincide with the conference. The council received 96 individual case reports
  from people affected by Islamophobia since 2021, but 26 of these had come in a
  six month period, from January to July this year, the council said. Most of
  the reports related to verbal abuse or mockery, followed by workplace
  discrimination. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian
  Australia’s Nino Bucci: Man, child seriously hurt after being hit by a car in
  Logan, Queensland A man and a child are in a life-threatening condition after
  being hit by a car in Logan, Queensland this morning. Police are investigating
  after the car struck two pedestrians just after 11am. Multiple paramedic crews
  attended the scene, with a man in his 30s and a primary school-age boy rushed
  to hospital. The Forensic Crash Unit is investigating. Queensland Police and
  the Queensland ambulance service could not provide any more information at
  this time. ‘Mini hearts’ to save cancer survivors from heart disease Lab-grown
  “mini hearts” are being used to test new drugs researchers hope will protect
  breast cancer patients from heart failure. A team of scientists at the Heart
  Research Institute are using lab-grown “mini hearts” – the size of a grain of
  sand created from patient blood samples – to test drugs that could one day be
  given with chemotherapy. “We currently have limited knowledge on why
  cardiotoxicity occurs and which women will be most impacted,” lead researcher
  Prof Julie McMullen said. This research has the opportunity to identify women
  at risk of cardiotoxicity before symptoms are present, so we can develop drugs
  to protect the heart during and after cancer treatment. While the research
  project is still in the pre-clinical stage, its potential is significant. The
  microscopic 3D “mini heart” models mimic aspects of how the human heart
  functions. The next step in the project will be to use breast cancer patient
  blood samples to generate personalised mini hearts. – AAP Anthony Albanese
  says Australia wants a ceasefire in Ukraine, and says Russia cannot be
  rewarded for its invasion, but says Donald Trump rolling out a literal red
  carpet for Vladimir Putin in Alaska is “a matter for the US administration”.
  The prime minister was speaking in Perth a short while ago. Most of the
  discussion was about this week’s economic reform summit, and the prime
  minister’s comments were very similar to those of the treasurer, Jim Chalmers,
  earlier. Asked about the meeting between presidents Trump and Putin, where
  Trump came away talking about a lasting peace agreement rather than the
  immediate ceasefire European leaders have been pleading for, Albanese said:
  “We want to see a ceasefire.” We want to see the sovereignty of Ukraine
  protected. It is a good thing that President Trump is an advocate for peace.
  What we want to see is that the sovereignty of Ukraine be protected and that
  the illegal and immoral invasion conducted by Mr Putin and Russia are not
  rewarded. Asked about the red carpet that Trump and Putin walked on when
  arriving at the meeting, Albanese declined to comment, saying it was “a matter
  for President Trump and the US administration”. Albanese continued: It’s a
  good thing that people have dialogue. What we want to see is a ceasefire. What
  we want to see is an end to the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, a
  sovereign state, because it’s important as well for the international rule of
  law. It’s also important because of the precedent that Russia’s invasion sets,
  of a powerful nation invading a much smaller nation and engaging in brutality,
  which we have seen at great cost to the Ukrainian people, but also at a great
  cost to Russian soldiers who’ve lost their lives as well. ‘Dump it, or we’ll
  dump you’: secretive consultancy group sends Liberal MPs barrage of emails
  over net zero policy Liberal MPs have been sent a barrage of emails demanding
  they drop net zero targets or “risk losing our support” by a group connected
  to conservative rightwing lobby group Advance. The mass emails, seen by
  Guardian Australia, have been sent to multiple Liberals by Whitestone
  Strategic, a secretive political consultancy group and come as the Coalition
  reviews its energy policy. Coalition MPs began receiving the emails – which
  one described as looking like they were sent by AI bots – on Monday night.
  Some MPs received more than 100 within 48 hours from the same address. One of
  the emails reads: A message to the Liberal Party and Nationals: Net Zero is
  causing irreversible damage to our nation. Our economic health is declining …
  immediate action is required. Dump Net Zero policies now, or we will stop
  supporting your agenda. Another reads: “Net Zero is a dangerous joke. It’s
  time to dump it, or we’ll dump you.” For more on this story, read the full
  report by Guardian Australia’s Krishani Dhanji and Josh Butler Support groups
  call for adequate housing instead of ‘punitive’ measures against rough
  sleepers Community groups say Queensland councils must end “punitive policies”
  about rough sleeping after a court made a temporary order stopping the
  eviction of 11 homeless people from a Moreton Bay park. Guardian Australia
  reported that the supreme court issued an injunction on Friday preventing the
  Moreton Bay city council from demolishing a homeless camp in Goodfellows Road,
  a park in the suburb of Kallangur. The council changed its local laws to ban
  homelessness in February. In April, it started evicting residents of several
  homeless shelters, using police, council rangers, a bulldozer and an excavator
  to enforce the law. The injunction will prevent the removal of anyone from
  Goodfellows Road as a court challenge against the council’s homelessness
  policies proceeds. Northwest Community Group and Nourish Street, both groups
  who provide support to homeless people, said they welcomed the decision and
  said it confirmed that punitive policies were “unlawful, unsafe and
  unsustainable”. “This ruling shows that people’s basic human rights come
  first,” said Northwest Community Group president Paul Slater. For too long,
  councils have been destroying homes and belongings instead of working with
  community to find real solutions. In the last two and a half years, I have
  personally put up more than 1,000 tents for people who had nowhere else to go.
  We don’t want to see people living in temporary shelters either – but until
  there is adequate housing and support, we refuse to let people be forced into
  the gutter. Chalmers says economic roundtable already focusing minds on
  productivity Treasurer Jim Chalmers is already claiming success from the
  economic roundtable, which hasn’t even been held yet, saying all the
  discussion and debate in the lead-up to the three-day event was an outcome in
  itself. It comes as the government faces questions and criticism about what
  will actually come from the much-vaunted reform summit, and whether outcomes
  have already been pre-ordained. In a press conference today, Chalmers hit back
  at critics, claiming naysayers were “really arguing for us to involve people
  less, which is not how this government rolls”. From the prime minister down,
  this government is about working through issues in a considered and a
  consultative way, a methodical way, and that’s what the economic reform
  roundtable is all about. Chalmers said he was “confident” that progress would
  come from the meeting. I’m confident that the effort put into this … is
  already worth it. We’ve focused the country on the productivity challenge.
  We’ve gotten people accustomed to dealing with the economic and fiscal
  trade‑offs that governments deal with every day. We’ve made progress with the
  regulators already, hundreds of ideas from the regulators when it comes to
  better regulation, cutting red tape, getting our economy moving more
  efficiently and effectively, cutting approval times. And these will be key
  considerations in the coming week as well. Queensland premier’s fresh comments
  on chief health officer decision leave much unanswered Queensland Premier
  David Crisafulli has refused to discuss his decision to veto the appointment
  of a new chief health officer despite a merit-based process having settled on
  the candidate. Dr Krispin Hajkowicz had been chosen through a merit-based
  process run by an external recruitment agency to take over the role. The
  Brisbane Times reports Crisafulli spoke in Townsville on Saturday where he
  publicly commented on the decision but refused to answer a question about
  whether he had spoken to Hajkowicz personally. Dr Hajkowicz was previously
  nominated for the position in 2021 by the former Labor government but chose
  not to take the job days before the official start date for personal reasons.
  The Sydney fish market has shown off its new roof lighting system to be used
  to mark special major events. Weighing more than 2,500 tonnes, the lighting
  system features more than 400 individual light fixtures, more than 4
  kilometres of cabling, with each individual light capable of being
  individually programmed to create multi-coloured and moving displays. The 200m
  long floating roof canopy will be activated to mark major public events and is
  expected to be used during Vivid and upcoming World Cups. The NSW minister for
  lands and property, Steve Kamper, said the lighting system was a “taste of
  what’s to come” with the redevelopment. The roof, with its magnificent
  wave-like form and fish-scale design, is a sight to behold during the day, and
  even more spectacular at night when it is lit up. We are now well and truly on
  the home stretch and we look forward to the new Sydney Fish Market being
  completed by the end of the year. The Sydney fish market CEO, Daniel Jarosch,
  said the upgrade would make the market a “world-class destination”. We’re
  proud to bring this bold vision to life, celebrating the heart of NSW’s
  seafood industry and invigorating our tourism future. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, is in Perth today where he is expected to speak to reporters
  at 10am local time, which is noon on the east coast. We will bring you the
  latest as it happens. Nigel Farage social media adviser suggests UK better off
  if it had not fought in WW2 An adviser used by Nigel Farage and others in
  Reform UK to boost their social media popularity has suggested Britain would
  be better off had it stayed neutral in the second world war instead of
  fighting Nazi Germany. Jack Anderton, who ran Farage’s hugely successful
  TikTok account before helping Luke Campbell become the Reform mayor of Hull
  and East Yorkshire, said also that the UK should not support Ukraine in its
  fight against Russian aggression. In a post on his personal blog about
  Britain’s international standing, Anderton said that in a future world of
  “meritocracy”, the UK could “regain” former colonies such as Australia, Canada
  and South Africa. For more on this story, read the full report by the
  Guardian’s, Peter Walker: Women thought lost at Catherine Hill Bay, NSW, found
  safe and well Four women reported missing in New South Wales after being
  spotted stranded on rocks at Catherine Hill Bay have been found safe and well.
  A search for the women began on Saturday afternoon but was called off after no
  trace of them could be found. After public reports about the search and
  anappeal for information, one of the four women contacted police to say they
  were safe. Police have thanked the public and media for their help. Protesters
  angry about WA Maritime Museum event sponsored by gas driller Woodside People
  are expected to protest outside the WA Maritime Museum today about plans by
  Australian energy company Woodside to drill beneath the pristine Scott Reef as
  part of its gas expansion plans. The rally, organised by the Conservation
  Council of Western Australia (CCWA), will coincide with “Woodside Open Day”, a
  sponsored event held at the museum as part of an ongoing research partnership
  for children. For more on that story, read Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox’s
  story: Climate groups and the WA Greens have responded with fury about the
  partnership because of the damage to the state’s coral reef systems from
  climate change. CCWA executive director Matt Roberts says Woodside’s plans to
  sink 50 gas wells around the reef “would be a fatal blow”. How is it that one
  of the state’s biggest environmental vandals, with a terrible track record
  when it comes to the environment, can have the gall to invite children to come
  and learn about how special our oceans and marine life are, while
  simultaneously planning to drill 50 gas wells beneath one of the last
  remaining coral reefs yet to succumb to widespread bleaching? Our oceans are
  dying, coral reefs are bleaching at unprecedented rates, our beloved marine
  life are washing up dead before our very eyes due to climate change and
  Woodside has the audacity to run this propaganda campaign.” The oil and gas
  industry has long used strategic partnerships, particularly with educational
  institutions, to build goodwill among the public as part of a broader
  marketing strategy. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake has struck Sulawesi, Indonesia,
  today, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) says. The quake struck
  at a depth of 10kms. There have been no reports of damage or injury. We will
  bring you the latest as it develops. Alex Hawke: Opposition wants to know what
  is actually on Chalmers’ productivity agenda The opposition continues to
  downplay the government’s economic reform summit this week, with shadow
  industry minister Alex Hawke saying the Coalition “don’t have a lot of
  expectations”. “[Jim Chalmers] talks about his big productivity agenda. But
  what is it? He says the government’s already got a big productivity agenda.
  Name what the government’s done on productivity,” Hawke told Sky News. After
  four years in government, it’s basically saying, let’s have a roundtable, and
  I’ll hear all the best ideas. Shadow treasurer Ted O’Brien has accepted an
  invitation to attend the roundtable. Earlier on Sky, Chalmers said O’Brien
  would get a chance to contribute to the meeting, but claimed his counterpart
  had not submitted any ideas ahead of the meeting – one of the only people who
  hadn’t done so, Chalmers said. “He needs to take this seriously,” Chalmers
  said of O’Brien. Hawke, on Sky, said he thought the opposition “should
  participate”. “Ted’s got some good views, but he’s put down some markers,”
  Hawke said, noting O’Brien had urged no new taxes, a focus on addressing
  intergenerational equity, and a call for helpful productivity measures. Jim
  Chalmers: dismisses scepticism about the value of the economic roundtable
  Staying with Jim Chalmers on Sky News, the treasurer said he expected tax
  “will come up every day” of the economic roundtable, but “productivity, as I
  said a couple of times now, is the main game”. In the interview, Chalmers
  again dismissed any immediate changes to income tax, company tax or moves such
  as the GST. He said the government was open to ideas, but that “we want to
  maintain that focus on productivity”. We want to maintain that focus on budget
  sustainability and economic resilience, and we figure that’s the best way to
  make the conversation useful. Asked why the government was holding the
  roundtable at all, considering criticisms from some business groups and
  experts about what it will actually achieve, Chalmers said he and PM Anthony
  Albanese believed the best way to work out economic challenges “is to do that
  together”. The treasurer dismissed the skepticism of those who have criticised
  the summit. To involve people where we can, to build consensus, and to build
  momentum around some of these next steps, which build on the very substantial
  economic agenda that we’re already rolling out. We’ve got a big productivity
  agenda already, but the best way to work out the next steps is to do that
  together. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government is still working on how
  to implement a road user charge for electric vehicles, but indicated the
  change could come sooner rather than later. On the eve of the economic
  roundtable, which will run most of this week in Canberra, Chalmers has again
  downplayed the prospect of major tax changes, saying the focus will be on
  productivity. You can read more about the roundtable in Guardian Australia’s
  interview with Chalmers: There have been questions raised about what will
  actually be achieved or agreed at the roundtable, but Chalmers has hinted
  heavily at the idea of a road user charge, which could supplement or replace
  the fuel excise (with EV users not paying that charge). Asked on Sky News this
  morning whether a road user charge would replace the fuel excise, Chalmers
  said: “we haven’t settled on a model or on the timing of implementation … we
  don’t have a settled view on the best timing”. This is something I’ve been
  discussing with the state and territory treasurers. This is work that we’re
  doing together, working up options. But we don’t have a concluded view on the
  best model. Chalmers and prime minister Anthony Albanese have downplayed
  prospects of making major tax changes in this term of government that weren’t
  taken to the May election. But Chalmers noted that the government had been
  talking about road user charges before the election – indicating that, since
  they were flagged for some time, he believed these could be changes made in
  this term without a new election mandate. There’s a lot of complexity. There’s
  a lot of trade offs there. And so we’ll take the time to get it right. Search
  called off for four women seen on rocks at Catherine Hill Bay Authorities have
  called off a search for four women reportedly stranded on rocks south of
  Catherine Hill Bay beach in New South Wales on Saturday. A search began when
  police were called to the area just before 2pm after reports that a group of
  four women were on the rocks. Conditions in the area were calm but the rocks
  are known to be dangerous. Emergency services carried out the search but the
  women disappeared from view and they could not be found. The whereabouts and
  status of the women is unknown. Tim Wilson sidesteps question about whether
  Coalition will dump support for net zero Finally, Wilson was asked about
  internal pressure within the Coalition to abandon support for any policies
  that might help Australia achieve net zero and to address the climate crisis.
  We should make sure that we have net zero outages, net zero price increases,
  and net zero emissions, because you need to have things in a position of
  balance of policy to make sure that we can grow the future of the Australian
  economy, because that’s also the basis of social licence to cut emissions as
  well. If you don’t have net zero outages and net zero price increases, public
  support for net zero emissions reduction is also going to fray. Recent power
  outages in Australia, such as the 2016 South Australian blackout, have been
  caused by extreme weather events amplified by climate change, or failures in
  old fossil fuel infrastructure such as the 2021 Callide C power station
  explosion. At the previous election, Wilson narrowly beat a Teal-independent
  Zoe Daniel who had in-turn been elected because of concerns about Australia’s
  failure to address climate change under the previous Coalition government.
  Wilson vague about how the Coalition will improve the economy Talking to the
  ABC’s David Speers, this morning, Wilson was vague about how Coalition would
  improve the economy. I’m going to work with my colleagues to make sure we
  drive them forward as part of a policy package to take to the next election.
  I’m absolutely committed to making sure we have simplification, to make it
  easier to employ more Australians, and to raise standards of living, and
  improve the number of Australians [getting jobs] and well-paid jobs. We’ve got
  big challenges coming ahead around [things] like artificial intelligence and
  making sure we make workplaces more productive, but also building out the
  capacity for small businesses to be successful as part of a dynamic economy.
  But the most important thing is that, when we make decisions, our focus is
  going to be on how we improve and grow the economic pie for the country,
  David. It’s not going to be focused on … laws to rule things in or out, based
  on whether we’re paying off and clipping the ticket for our union mates –
  which has been the basis that this government has taken for its trade union
  mates. Simplification, artificial intelligence, well paid jobs – a lot of
  talking points, few policy details. Tim Wilson: Victoria’s work-from-home
  policy ‘ill thought out political stunt’ Wilson would not say if the Coalition
  supports a legally enshrined right to work from home. Wilson was asked
  repeatedly about his party’s position about this but said there are already
  rules in place to allow workers and bosses to negotiate. Well, we’ve made it
  clear that we believe working from home works best when you have employers and
  employees working together. Now, there’s already pre-existing arrangements
  under federal legislation to give workers a pathway to do so. Asked whether
  the Coalition opposes similar moves in Victoria, Wilson described the push by
  the Allan government as “an ill thought out political stunt, not one of
  substance” for its exclusion of “many different types of workers”. Wilson was
  asked five times whether he opposed the Victorian legislation. His response:
  It hasn’t been put forward in federal legislation, it’s something in state
  legislation. And … the federal legislation already provides provisions to make
  sure that Australians can work from home, because we support work-from-home as
  part of workplace flexibility arrangements. Wilson was then asked whether he
  opposed four-day working weeks: Well, if employers and employees want to come
  together and negotiate arrangements that suit them, that’s a very different
  thing from what Sally McManus is proposing, where they’re seeking to legislate
  these sorts of proposals, which they aren’t even adopting themselves. Wilson
  also refused to explain his stance on a proposal from some Young Liberals to
  limit negative gearing to one property. Tim Wilson: Australian government has
  written ‘blank cheque’ to Hamas Any resolution to Israel’s war on Gaza and the
  broader question about the future of a Palestinian state requires the
  involvement of the United States and Israel, Coalition MP Tim Wilson says.
  Wilson says the government had previously said Hamas could not participate in
  a future government but it has not made clear how this might be achieved with
  the decision to recognise a Palestinian state. What they’ve done is written a
  blank cheque, very clearly, to those who are sponsoring terror, and, in fact,
  what it’s actually doing is providing incentives where Hamas as an
  organisation uses civilians as part of its propaganda efforts, and it’s
  incentivising more of that conduct into the future. And it will be civilians
  that will pay the price for that. Hamas was democratically elected to govern
  Gaza in elections in 2005. Wilson: Albanese government has thrown bipartisan
  position on Palestinian state into ‘turmoil’ The Albanese government stopped
  engaging with the Coalition before it recognised a Palestinian state, upending
  what was a bipartisan agreement about the conflict with Israel, Tim Wilson
  says. Wilson says there had been an agreement about what was needed to resolve
  the conflict and there had been preconditions agreed upon. We’ve taken a
  long-term bipartisan position around a two-state solution based on a series of
  pre-conditions that we would expect to be met, like the lasting security in
  respect for the state of Israel. Like making sure Israeli hostages are
  returned. Like making sure there isn’t going to be Hamas running any
  government. We’ve set about pre-conditions and we’ve been very public about
  that. Up until last Monday, that was also the position of the government. Now,
  what the government has done is essentially thrown that into turmoil by making
  a commitment to recognise a Palestinian state. But not being able to then say
  if those preconditions are going to be met, that they’re going to back down.
  There wasn’t the engagement with the opposition up until this point. I would
  have thought that, actually having an engagement with the opposition for a
  lasting policy position from the Australian government would be a sensible way
  forward. They’ve chosen not to take that path. Any decision about the future
  of Ukraine must involve the Ukrainian government, says Coalition MP Tim
  Wilson. Speaking to ABC Insiders host David Speers this morning, Wilson
  reaffirmed his party’s view that “any sort of arrangement needs to be deeply
  involved in Kyiv”, after US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian
  President Vladimir Putin. Because the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia is
  not something that we’ve ever been prepared to tolerate, and anything going
  forward needs the Ukrainians on board as part of a lasting resolution towards
  peace. Labor and the Coalition have long maintained a bipartisan view that any
  discussion about the future of Ukraine must involve the Ukrainian government.
  Wilson, however, sought to criticise the government for handling its
  relationship with the US saying “it’s really important that we maintain an
  active engagement with the United States” saying Australia’s influence with
  the US had been “weakened this week” – reference to the decision by Australia
  to recognise a Palestinian state. Asked whether Australia should not criticise
  Trump, Wilson said: I’ve never said that at all. I mean, government is well
  within its rights to criticise another government if it disagrees. The most
  important thing is we are in a position to be able to influence it
  successfully. Sometimes publicly, sometimes privately. Wilson double sparks
  remarkable Australia comeback win to stun South Africa Australia rallied from
  22-0 down as Harry Wilson, their captain, scored two tries in a stunning 38-22
  bonus-point victory over South Africa in their Rugby Championship opener on
  Saturday, the Wallabies’ first victory at Ellis Park in Johannesburg since
  1963. South Africa raced into a seemingly commanding lead through tries by the
  wing Kurt-Lee Arendse, the centre André Esterhuizen and the No 8 Siya Kolisi,
  but their achilles heel has been the breakdown and it was there that Australia
  began to take control. The Springboks led 22-5 at half-time but Australia came
  alive in the second period and were excellent in soaking up pressure and
  hitting the world champions with fast breaks as they won on South African soil
  for the first time in 14 years. For more on this remarkable comeback, read the
  full report: Four people have been arrested after a clash between two groups
  of protesters in Melbourne on Saturday. A group of about 120 people attended a
  Women Will Speak rally in the CBD at noon yesterday which was met by a counter
  protest of 80 people gathering in support of transgender rights. Three
  officers were injured as they tried to separate the two protest groups. The
  rally organisers said they had gathered to demand the state government “stop
  conflating sex and gender identity in policy and law”. Conservative political
  party Family First encouraged its supporters to attend the Women Will Speak
  rally, saying the rights of women and girls were being “trampled” by
  “misguided laws” that protected the rights of transpeople. Social media
  accounts belonging to activist group Trans Queer Solidarity encouraged people
  to attend the counter rally saying the Women Will Speak protest sought to end
  the existence of trans people. It said the group acted to “pipeline people to
  the far-right”. Coalition senator Tim Wilson will speak to ABC Insiders host
  David Speers this morning. Earlier, Treasurer Jim Chalmers spoke to Sky News
  about the government’s economic roundtable. He was followed by Shadow Industry
  Minister Alex Hawke. And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog.

With that, we’re wrapping up the blog. Before we go, here are the major stories from today: Four arrests have been made after clashes between people attending a Women Will Speak rally and those who took part in a counter demonstration supporting transgender rights in the Melbourne CBD on Saturday; An earthquake has struck the Indonesia island of Sulawesi; The Sydney fish market roof will light up future events with its roof lighting system being taken for a test drive; Discussions are under way about when a EV user road charge may be introduced by the federal government; Coalition’s Tim Wilson has reiterated his party’s support for Ukraine to be involved in any decision about its future; Prime minister Anthony Albanese says Russia cannot be rewarded for its war of aggression in Ukraine. We’ll pick things up again tomorrow. Housing auction market performing strongly Auction activity is warming up with 1,972 auctions to be held, this weekend. That’s more than the 1,587 auctions held last week but less than the 2,065 held this time last year. Based on results collected so far, Cotality’s summary found that the preliminary clearance rate was 75% across the country, compared with a 71.7% preliminary rate recorded last week but above the 68.7% actual rate on final numbers and the 64.8% at the same time last year. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 548 of 720 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 75% Melbourne: 728 of 961 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 75.5% Brisbane: 92 0f 137 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 69.6% Adelaide: 50 of 90 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 78% Canberra: 36 of 52 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 80.6% Tasmania: One auction to be held. Perth: Six of eleven auctions held. Productivity to dominate agenda as economic symposium begins After weeks of build up, one of the biggest events on Australia’s economic calendar is about to begin as the government seeks answers to the country’s weak productivity. On Tuesday, Treasurer Jim Chalmers will finally convene his economic reform roundtable. Heavyweights in the field, such as former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, consumer watchdog chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb, Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus and Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Blackwill meet in Canberra for three days to discuss ways to lift Australia’s living standards. Productivity will be the primary focus but the forum will also discuss ways to build resilience and strengthen the budget. The federal government has been promoting the event for weeks as stakeholders submitted ideas to reinvigorate the economy. Ideas from property investor tax break cuts to AI and environmental law reform have been floated but Chalmers has reined in expectations of animmediate shake-up of the economy. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says his government is “unashamedly open” to ideas, but major changes in some areas such as tax policy have already been ruled out. – AAP Salmon industry investigation ordered amid disease concerns The Tasmanian Liberal party has promised to pause salmon farm expansion and instigate an independent review of the industry as it attempts to win support from crossbench MPs and survive a no-confidence motion in the state parliament this week. In a concession to independent MPs critical of salmon farms operating in public waterways, the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, today said he supported the industry but said it was “on notice” after a mass mortality event last summer. He said it must “operate transparently and responsibly and meet its obligations to the community”. Rockliff said also the government would respond by introducing a marine environment act to strengthen regulation of the industry and order a study by an “off-island specialist organisation”. The industry can’t expand until that study is done, he said. We know how important transparency is to the industry so we expect them to fully participate in the study. Our government would want to see from this study practical reforms and smarter regulations that protect our environment, but also investment certainty for industry.

On Saturday, the council held its first conference on Islamophobia, with politicians, police, religious leaders and academics among attending the event in Melbourne. More than 85% of Islamophobia incidents are not reported, according to a report released to coincide with the conference. The council received 96 individual case reports from people affected by Islamophobia since 2021, but 26 of these had come in a six month period, from January to July this year, the council said. Most of the reports related to verbal abuse or mockery, followed by workplace discrimination.

Police are investigating after the car struck two pedestrians just after 11am. Multiple paramedic crews attended the scene, with a man in his 30s and a primary school-age boy rushed to hospital. The Forensic Crash Unit is investigating. Queensland Police and the Queensland ambulance service could not provide any more information at this time. ‘Mini hearts’ to save cancer survivors from heart disease Lab-grown “mini hearts” are being used to test new drugs researchers hope will protect breast cancer patients from heart failure. A team of scientists at the Heart Research Institute are using lab-grown “mini hearts” – the size of a grain of sand created from patient blood samples – to test drugs that could one day be given with chemotherapy. “We currently have limited knowledge on why cardiotoxicity occurs and which women will be most impacted,” lead researcher Prof Julie McMullen said. This research has the opportunity to identify women at risk of cardiotoxicity before symptoms are present, so we can develop drugs to protect the heart during and after cancer treatment. While the research project is still in the pre-clinical stage, its potential is significant. The microscopic 3D “mini heart” models mimic aspects of how the human heart functions. The next step in the project will be to use breast cancer patient blood samples to generate personalised mini hearts. – AAP Anthony Albanese says Australia wants a ceasefire in Ukraine, and says Russia cannot be rewarded for its invasion, but says Donald Trump rolling out a literal red carpet for Vladimir Putin in Alaska is “a matter for the US administration”. The prime minister was speaking in Perth a short while ago. Most of the discussion was about this week’s economic reform summit, and the prime minister’s comments were very similar to those of the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, earlier. Asked about the meeting between presidents Trump and Putin, where Trump came away talking about a lasting peace agreement rather than the immediate ceasefire European leaders have been pleading for, Albanese said: “We want to see a ceasefire.” We want to see the sovereignty of Ukraine protected. It is a good thing that President Trump is an advocate for peace. What we want to see is that the sovereignty of Ukraine be protected and that the illegal and immoral invasion conducted by Mr Putin and Russia are not rewarded. Asked about the red carpet that Trump and Putin walked on when arriving at the meeting, Albanese declined to comment, saying it was “a matter for President Trump and the US administration”. Albanese continued: It’s a good thing that people have dialogue. What we want to see is a ceasefire. What we want to see is an end to the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign state, because it’s important as well for the international rule of law. It’s also important because of the precedent that Russia’s invasion sets, of a powerful nation invading a much smaller nation and engaging in brutality, which we have seen at great cost to the Ukrainian people, but also at a great cost to Russian soldiers who’ve lost their lives as well. ‘Dump it, or we’ll dump you’: secretive consultancy group sends Liberal MPs barrage of emails over net zero policy Liberal MPs have been sent a barrage of emails demanding they drop net zero targets or “risk losing our support” by a group connected to conservative rightwing lobby group Advance. The mass emails, seen by Guardian Australia, have been sent to multiple Liberals by Whitestone Strategic, a secretive political consultancy group and come as the Coalition reviews its energy policy. Coalition MPs began receiving the emails – which one described as looking like they were sent by AI bots – on Monday night. Some MPs received more than 100 within 48 hours from the same address. One of the emails reads: A message to the Liberal Party and Nationals: Net Zero is causing irreversible damage to our nation. Our economic health is declining … immediate action is required. Dump Net Zero policies now, or we will stop supporting your agenda. Another reads: “Net Zero is a dangerous joke. It’s time to dump it, or we’ll dump you.” For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia’s Krishani Dhanji and Josh Butler Support groups call for adequate housing instead of ‘punitive’ measures against rough sleepers Community groups say Queensland councils must end “punitive policies” about rough sleeping after a court made a temporary order stopping the eviction of 11 homeless people from a Moreton Bay park. Guardian Australia reported that the supreme court issued an injunction on Friday preventing the Moreton Bay city council from demolishing a homeless camp in Goodfellows Road, a park in the suburb of Kallangur. The council changed its local laws to ban homelessness in February. In April, it started evicting residents of several homeless shelters, using police, council rangers, a bulldozer and an excavator to enforce the law. The injunction will prevent the removal of anyone from Goodfellows Road as a court challenge against the council’s homelessness policies proceeds. Northwest Community Group and Nourish Street, both groups who provide support to homeless people, said they welcomed the decision and said it confirmed that punitive policies were “unlawful, unsafe and unsustainable”. “This ruling shows that people’s basic human rights come first,” said Northwest Community Group president Paul Slater. For too long, councils have been destroying homes and belongings instead of working with community to find real solutions. In the last two and a half years, I have personally put up more than 1,000 tents for people who had nowhere else to go. We don’t want to see people living in temporary shelters either – but until there is adequate housing and support, we refuse to let people be forced into the gutter. Chalmers says economic roundtable already focusing minds on productivity Treasurer Jim Chalmers is already claiming success from the economic roundtable, which hasn’t even been held yet, saying all the discussion and debate in the lead-up to the three-day event was an outcome in itself. It comes as the government faces questions and criticism about what will actually come from the much-vaunted reform summit, and whether outcomes have already been pre-ordained. In a press conference today, Chalmers hit back at critics, claiming naysayers were “really arguing for us to involve people less, which is not how this government rolls”. From the prime minister down, this government is about working through issues in a considered and a consultative way, a methodical way, and that’s what the economic reform roundtable is all about. Chalmers said he was “confident” that progress would come from the meeting. I’m confident that the effort put into this … is already worth it. We’ve focused the country on the productivity challenge. We’ve gotten people accustomed to dealing with the economic and fiscal trade‑offs that governments deal with every day. We’ve made progress with the regulators already, hundreds of ideas from the regulators when it comes to better regulation, cutting red tape, getting our economy moving more efficiently and effectively, cutting approval times. And these will be key considerations in the coming week as well. Queensland premier’s fresh comments on chief health officer decision leave much unanswered Queensland Premier David Crisafulli has refused to discuss his decision to veto the appointment of a new chief health officer despite a merit-based process having settled on the candidate. Dr Krispin Hajkowicz had been chosen through a merit-based process run by an external recruitment agency to take over the role. The Brisbane Times reports Crisafulli spoke in Townsville on Saturday where he publicly commented on the decision but refused to answer a question about whether he had spoken to Hajkowicz personally. Dr Hajkowicz was previously nominated for the position in 2021 by the former Labor government but chose not to take the job days before the official start date for personal reasons. The Sydney fish market has shown off its new roof lighting system to be used to mark special major events. Weighing more than 2,500 tonnes, the lighting system features more than 400 individual light fixtures, more than 4 kilometres of cabling, with each individual light capable of being individually programmed to create multi-coloured and moving displays. The 200m long floating roof canopy will be activated to mark major public events and is expected to be used during Vivid and upcoming World Cups. The NSW minister for lands and property, Steve Kamper, said the lighting system was a “taste of what’s to come” with the redevelopment. The roof, with its magnificent wave-like form and fish-scale design, is a sight to behold during the day, and even more spectacular at night when it is lit up. We are now well and truly on the home stretch and we look forward to the new Sydney Fish Market being completed by the end of the year. The Sydney fish market CEO, Daniel Jarosch, said the upgrade would make the market a “world-class destination”. We’re proud to bring this bold vision to life, celebrating the heart of NSW’s seafood industry and invigorating our tourism future. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is in Perth today where he is expected to speak to reporters at 10am local time, which is noon on the east coast. We will bring you the latest as it happens. Nigel Farage social media adviser suggests UK better off if it had not fought in WW2 An adviser used by Nigel Farage and others in Reform UK to boost their social media popularity has suggested Britain would be better off had it stayed neutral in the second world war instead of fighting Nazi Germany. Jack Anderton, who ran Farage’s hugely successful TikTok account before helping Luke Campbell become the Reform mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire, said also that the UK should not support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. In a post on his personal blog about Britain’s international standing, Anderton said that in a future world of “meritocracy”, the UK could “regain” former colonies such as Australia, Canada and South Africa. For more on this story, read the full report by the Guardian’s, Peter Walker: Women thought lost at Catherine Hill Bay, NSW, found safe and well Four women reported missing in New South Wales after being spotted stranded on rocks at Catherine Hill Bay have been found safe and well. A search for the women began on Saturday afternoon but was called off after no trace of them could be found. After public reports about the search and anappeal for information, one of the four women contacted police to say they were safe. Police have thanked the public and media for their help. Protesters angry about WA Maritime Museum event sponsored by gas driller Woodside People are expected to protest outside the WA Maritime Museum today about plans by Australian energy company Woodside to drill beneath the pristine Scott Reef as part of its gas expansion plans. The rally, organised by the Conservation Council of Western Australia (CCWA), will coincide with “Woodside Open Day”, a sponsored event held at the museum as part of an ongoing research partnership for children. For more on that story, read Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox’s story: Climate groups and the WA Greens have responded with fury about the partnership because of the damage to the state’s coral reef systems from climate change. CCWA executive director Matt Roberts says Woodside’s plans to sink 50 gas wells around the reef “would be a fatal blow”. How is it that one of the state’s biggest environmental vandals, with a terrible track record when it comes to the environment, can have the gall to invite children to come and learn about how special our oceans and marine life are, while simultaneously planning to drill 50 gas wells beneath one of the last remaining coral reefs yet to succumb to widespread bleaching? Our oceans are dying, coral reefs are bleaching at unprecedented rates, our beloved marine life are washing up dead before our very eyes due to climate change and Woodside has the audacity to run this propaganda campaign.” The oil and gas industry has long used strategic partnerships, particularly with educational institutions, to build goodwill among the public as part of a broader marketing strategy. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake has struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, today, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) says. The quake struck at a depth of 10kms. There have been no reports of damage or injury. We will bring you the latest as it develops. Alex Hawke: Opposition wants to know what is actually on Chalmers’ productivity agenda The opposition continues to downplay the government’s economic reform summit this week, with shadow industry minister Alex Hawke saying the Coalition “don’t have a lot of expectations”. “[Jim Chalmers] talks about his big productivity agenda. But what is it? He says the government’s already got a big productivity agenda. Name what the government’s done on productivity,” Hawke told Sky News. After four years in government, it’s basically saying, let’s have a roundtable, and I’ll hear all the best ideas. Shadow treasurer Ted O’Brien has accepted an invitation to attend the roundtable. Earlier on Sky, Chalmers said O’Brien would get a chance to contribute to the meeting, but claimed his counterpart had not submitted any ideas ahead of the meeting – one of the only people who hadn’t done so, Chalmers said. “He needs to take this seriously,” Chalmers said of O’Brien. Hawke, on Sky, said he thought the opposition “should participate”. “Ted’s got some good views, but he’s put down some markers,” Hawke said, noting O’Brien had urged no new taxes, a focus on addressing intergenerational equity, and a call for helpful productivity measures. Jim Chalmers: dismisses scepticism about the value of the economic roundtable Staying with Jim Chalmers on Sky News, the treasurer said he expected tax “will come up every day” of the economic roundtable, but “productivity, as I said a couple of times now, is the main game”. In the interview, Chalmers again dismissed any immediate changes to income tax, company tax or moves such as the GST. He said the government was open to ideas, but that “we want to maintain that focus on productivity”. We want to maintain that focus on budget sustainability and economic resilience, and we figure that’s the best way to make the conversation useful. Asked why the government was holding the roundtable at all, considering criticisms from some business groups and experts about what it will actually achieve, Chalmers said he and PM Anthony Albanese believed the best way to work out economic challenges “is to do that together”. The treasurer dismissed the skepticism of those who have criticised the summit. To involve people where we can, to build consensus, and to build momentum around some of these next steps, which build on the very substantial economic agenda that we’re already rolling out. We’ve got a big productivity agenda already, but the best way to work out the next steps is to do that together. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government is still working on how to implement a road user charge for electric vehicles, but indicated the change could come sooner rather than later. On the eve of the economic roundtable, which will run most of this week in Canberra, Chalmers has again downplayed the prospect of major tax changes, saying the focus will be on productivity. You can read more about the roundtable in Guardian Australia’s interview with Chalmers: There have been questions raised about what will actually be achieved or agreed at the roundtable, but Chalmers has hinted heavily at the idea of a road user charge, which could supplement or replace the fuel excise (with EV users not paying that charge). Asked on Sky News this morning whether a road user charge would replace the fuel excise, Chalmers said: “we haven’t settled on a model or on the timing of implementation … we don’t have a settled view on the best timing”. This is something I’ve been discussing with the state and territory treasurers. This is work that we’re doing together, working up options. But we don’t have a concluded view on the best model. Chalmers and prime minister Anthony Albanese have downplayed prospects of making major tax changes in this term of government that weren’t taken to the May election. But Chalmers noted that the government had been talking about road user charges before the election – indicating that, since they were flagged for some time, he believed these could be changes made in this term without a new election mandate. There’s a lot of complexity. There’s a lot of trade offs there. And so we’ll take the time to get it right. Search called off for four women seen on rocks at Catherine Hill Bay Authorities have called off a search for four women reportedly stranded on rocks south of Catherine Hill Bay beach in New South Wales on Saturday. A search began when police were called to the area just before 2pm after reports that a group of four women were on the rocks. Conditions in the area were calm but the rocks are known to be dangerous. Emergency services carried out the search but the women disappeared from view and they could not be found. The whereabouts and status of the women is unknown. Tim Wilson sidesteps question about whether Coalition will dump support for net zero Finally, Wilson was asked about internal pressure within the Coalition to abandon support for any policies that might help Australia achieve net zero and to address the climate crisis. We should make sure that we have net zero outages, net zero price increases, and net zero emissions, because you need to have things in a position of balance of policy to make sure that we can grow the future of the Australian economy, because that’s also the basis of social licence to cut emissions as well. If you don’t have net zero outages and net zero price increases, public support for net zero emissions reduction is also going to fray. Recent power outages in Australia, such as the 2016 South Australian blackout, have been caused by extreme weather events amplified by climate change, or failures in old fossil fuel infrastructure such as the 2021 Callide C power station explosion. At the previous election, Wilson narrowly beat a Teal-independent Zoe Daniel who had in-turn been elected because of concerns about Australia’s failure to address climate change under the previous Coalition government. Wilson vague about how the Coalition will improve the economy Talking to the ABC’s David Speers, this morning, Wilson was vague about how Coalition would improve the economy. I’m going to work with my colleagues to make sure we drive them forward as part of a policy package to take to the next election. I’m absolutely committed to making sure we have simplification, to make it easier to employ more Australians, and to raise standards of living, and improve the number of Australians [getting jobs] and well-paid jobs. We’ve got big challenges coming ahead around [things] like artificial intelligence and making sure we make workplaces more productive, but also building out the capacity for small businesses to be successful as part of a dynamic economy. But the most important thing is that, when we make decisions, our focus is going to be on how we improve and grow the economic pie for the country, David. It’s not going to be focused on … laws to rule things in or out, based on whether we’re paying off and clipping the ticket for our union mates – which has been the basis that this government has taken for its trade union mates. Simplification, artificial intelligence, well paid jobs – a lot of talking points, few policy details. Tim Wilson: Victoria’s work-from-home policy ‘ill thought out political stunt’ Wilson would not say if the Coalition supports a legally enshrined right to work from home. Wilson was asked repeatedly about his party’s position about this but said there are already rules in place to allow workers and bosses to negotiate. Well, we’ve made it clear that we believe working from home works best when you have employers and employees working together. Now, there’s already pre-existing arrangements under federal legislation to give workers a pathway to do so. Asked whether the Coalition opposes similar moves in Victoria, Wilson described the push by the Allan government as “an ill thought out political stunt, not one of substance” for its exclusion of “many different types of workers”. Wilson was asked five times whether he opposed the Victorian legislation. His response: It hasn’t been put forward in federal legislation, it’s something in state legislation. And … the federal legislation already provides provisions to make sure that Australians can work from home, because we support work-from-home as part of workplace flexibility arrangements. Wilson was then asked whether he opposed four-day working weeks: Well, if employers and employees want to come together and negotiate arrangements that suit them, that’s a very different thing from what Sally McManus is proposing, where they’re seeking to legislate these sorts of proposals, which they aren’t even adopting themselves. Wilson also refused to explain his stance on a proposal from some Young Liberals to limit negative gearing to one property. Tim Wilson: Australian government has written ‘blank cheque’ to Hamas Any resolution to Israel’s war on Gaza and the broader question about the future of a Palestinian state requires the involvement of the United States and Israel, Coalition MP Tim Wilson says. Wilson says the government had previously said Hamas could not participate in a future government but it has not made clear how this might be achieved with the decision to recognise a Palestinian state. What they’ve done is written a blank cheque, very clearly, to those who are sponsoring terror, and, in fact, what it’s actually doing is providing incentives where Hamas as an organisation uses civilians as part of its propaganda efforts, and it’s incentivising more of that conduct into the future. And it will be civilians that will pay the price for that. Hamas was democratically elected to govern Gaza in elections in 2005. Wilson: Albanese government has thrown bipartisan position on Palestinian state into ‘turmoil’ The Albanese government stopped engaging with the Coalition before it recognised a Palestinian state, upending what was a bipartisan agreement about the conflict with Israel, Tim Wilson says. Wilson says there had been an agreement about what was needed to resolve the conflict and there had been preconditions agreed upon. We’ve taken a long-term bipartisan position around a two-state solution based on a series of pre-conditions that we would expect to be met, like the lasting security in respect for the state of Israel. Like making sure Israeli hostages are returned. Like making sure there isn’t going to be Hamas running any government. We’ve set about pre-conditions and we’ve been very public about that. Up until last Monday, that was also the position of the government. Now, what the government has done is essentially thrown that into turmoil by making a commitment to recognise a Palestinian state. But not being able to then say if those preconditions are going to be met, that they’re going to back down. There wasn’t the engagement with the opposition up until this point. I would have thought that, actually having an engagement with the opposition for a lasting policy position from the Australian government would be a sensible way forward. They’ve chosen not to take that path. Any decision about the future of Ukraine must involve the Ukrainian government, says Coalition MP Tim Wilson. Speaking to ABC Insiders host David Speers this morning, Wilson reaffirmed his party’s view that “any sort of arrangement needs to be deeply involved in Kyiv”, after US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Because the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia is not something that we’ve ever been prepared to tolerate, and anything going forward needs the Ukrainians on board as part of a lasting resolution towards peace. Labor and the Coalition have long maintained a bipartisan view that any discussion about the future of Ukraine must involve the Ukrainian government. Wilson, however, sought to criticise the government for handling its relationship with the US saying “it’s really important that we maintain an active engagement with the United States” saying Australia’s influence with the US had been “weakened this week” – reference to the decision by Australia to recognise a Palestinian state. Asked whether Australia should not criticise Trump, Wilson said: I’ve never said that at all. I mean, government is well within its rights to criticise another government if it disagrees. The most important thing is we are in a position to be able to influence it successfully. Sometimes publicly, sometimes privately. Wilson double sparks remarkable Australia comeback win to stun South Africa Australia rallied from 22-0 down as Harry Wilson, their captain, scored two tries in a stunning 38-22 bonus-point victory over South Africa in their Rugby Championship opener on Saturday, the Wallabies’ first victory at Ellis Park in Johannesburg since 1963. South Africa raced into a seemingly commanding lead through tries by the wing Kurt-Lee Arendse, the centre André Esterhuizen and the No 8 Siya Kolisi, but their achilles heel has been the breakdown and it was there that Australia began to take control. The Springboks led 22-5 at half-time but Australia came alive in the second period and were excellent in soaking up pressure and hitting the world champions with fast breaks as they won on South African soil for the first time in 14 years. For more on this remarkable comeback, read the full report: Four people have been arrested after a clash between two groups of protesters in Melbourne on Saturday. A group of about 120 people attended a Women Will Speak rally in the CBD at noon yesterday which was met by a counter protest of 80 people gathering in support of transgender rights. Three officers were injured as they tried to separate the two protest groups. The rally organisers said they had gathered to demand the state government “stop conflating sex and gender identity in policy and law”. Conservative political party Family First encouraged its supporters to attend the Women Will Speak rally, saying the rights of women and girls were being “trampled” by “misguided laws” that protected the rights of transpeople. Social media accounts belonging to activist group Trans Queer Solidarity encouraged people to attend the counter rally saying the Women Will Speak protest sought to end the existence of trans people. It said the group acted to “pipeline people to the far-right”. Coalition senator Tim Wilson will speak to ABC Insiders host David Speers this morning. Earlier, Treasurer Jim Chalmers spoke to Sky News about the government’s economic roundtable. He was followed by Shadow Industry Minister Alex Hawke. And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. Four people have been arrested after a clash between two groups of protesters in Melbourne on Saturday. A group of about 120 people attended a Women Will Speak rally at noon yesterday which was met by a counter protest of 80 people gathering in support of transgender rights. A search for four women reported stranded on rocks south of Catherine Hill Bay Beach, Lake Macquarie has been called off after emergency services failed to find anyone. People were called to the area on Saturday afternoon but despite their best efforts the status of the women remains unknown. I’m Royce Kurmelovs and I’ll be taking the blog through the day.
