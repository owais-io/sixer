  James Delbourgo, a professor of history at Rutgers University, New Jersey,
  says that his latest work is less a book about collecting than it is about the
  “cultural idea” of collecting. Does this need illuminating? Hasn’t collecting
  long been seen as one of the more refined arts? A way for the educated and
  wealthy to show off their learning, taste, urbanity? Collectors escape the
  shackles of the present, throw lifelines to a disappearing past, replenish the
  future. Sure, says Delbourgo. But he is also interested in telling the story
  of how – through the ages and across continents, in the popular and sometimes
  political imagination – collectors have been seen as introverts and perverts,
  as thieves and predators, as enemies of the humanity and humanism they
  espouse. The major religions have always been suspicious about collecting,
  which they associate not with piety so much as idolatry. Why, their leaders
  thundered, would true believers worship objects rather than God? Artefacts –
  whether early coins featuring the image of Muhammad or golden and
  gemstone-encrusted statues of the Buddha – were inherently flawed for, as
  theologian John Calvin declared, “the finite cannot contain the infinite”. Yet
  images had the power to reach parts of illiterate societies that words alone
  never could. Churches invested in relics not only to attract donations and
  pilgrim-tourists, but to succour and solace parishioners in times of war or
  pestilence. Within living memory, idolatry was one of the accusations levelled
  at collectors during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. They were targeted as
  decadents, bourgeois, in thrall to a discredited past. Their homes were
  raided, their antiquities destroyed. Such scorn for history would have
  appalled the Chinese thinkers and poets who, in the 17th century, developed
  the concept of pi, whose shifting meanings include hobby, craving,
  eccentricity, fetishism. But if it was an illness, it was one to be
  celebrated. A true gentleman, wrote Yuan Hongdao, “worries only about having
  no obsessions”. Collectors, it was believed, were brave, deep, devotional.
  Collecting is often assumed to be the preserve of men or man-boys. Notable
  exceptions include Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut and, in the 19th and 20th
  century, Isabella Stewart Gardner and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Women
  collectors, in the very act of acquiring things, are sometimes said to be
  betraying their gentle, nurturing, “female” essence. Women collectors, in the
  very act of acquiring things, are sometimes said to be betraying their gentle,
  nurturing, “female” essence. In the 17th century, Queen Christina of Sweden
  sought to make Stockholm the “Athens of the north”, asked Descartes to set up
  a scientific academy in the city and was open to alchemy and mysticism. None
  of this counted for much – she wore, they all sniggered, men’s clothes. She
  even refused to marry. Whether it’s Catherine the Great or Marie Antoinette,
  women’s appetite for objects has been portrayed as unbecoming, carnal,
  obscene. Delbourgo is at his liveliest when writing about collecting and
  empire. Those who sailed out into what they believed to be brave new worlds
  earned plaudits for advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge. Long
  before the advent of postcolonial studies, they were also seen as looters and
  frackers. By removing the Parthenon marbles, lamented Byron, Lord Elgin had
  riven “what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared”. For the explorer and
  biologist Alfred Wallace, “The wealth and knowledge and culture of the few do
  not constitute civilization”. Every chapter of A Noble Madness is its own
  cabinet of curiosities. Collecting has itself been collected – by novelists
  such as Oscar Wilde, John Fowles, Orhan Pamuk; film-makers Orson Welles and
  Alfred Hitchcock in Psycho; Sigmund Freud who thought collectors were
  displaced shaggers. Hokum? Delbourgo prefers such myths and storytelling to
  modern neuroscientists whose clinical explanations remind him of a lament by
  Charles Darwin: years of “grinding general laws out of large collections of
  facts”, wrote the naturalist, had led to “the atrophy of that part of his
  brain on which the higher tastes depend”. • A Noble Madness: The Dark Side of
  Collecting from Antiquity to Now by James Delbourg is published by Riverrun
  (£25). To support the Guardian order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
