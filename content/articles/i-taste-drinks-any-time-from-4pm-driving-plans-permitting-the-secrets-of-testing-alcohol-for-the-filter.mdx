  ‘I’ve got another parcel for 86. It’s booze again,” No 6 posts on the
  neighbourhood WhatsApp group. My neighbours believing I have an insatiable
  appetite for alcohol is an occupational hazard of testing gin, spritzes and
  cans for the Filter. On any given weekday during the recent heatwaves, I could
  be spotted knee deep in bottles at my patio table, which probably raised a few
  eyebrows too. I’ve been writing about drinks for a decade, so of course, I
  have to drink them. This can be tricky during normal working hours with a
  10-mile school run to negotiate, so I do a lot of background research first. I
  make notes on the nose, any interesting ingredients or production methods,
  look into recommended serves and read tasting notes before getting into the
  sampling. I’ll taste drinks any time from about 4pm (driving plans permitting)
  and make extensive notes so that I have everything I need when it comes to
  writing without having to drink again. Depending on what I’m testing, I’ll mix
  up the full drink and just take a sip; if it’s something like wine – or
  something I don’t like, such as an overly harsh spirit – I will spit it out.
  It usually takes me a few weeks to get through everything, as I won’t test
  every day (I do try not to drink every day), and then I will test the
  shortlists a few times. To try to whittle a long list down to a shorter one, I
  sip everything neat, earmarking my favourites. For the gin test, I tried them
  in different serves – with different tonics, over ice for sipping, in any
  suggested cocktails or with different recommended botanical garnishes – and
  against similar gins to make sure they really were the best. I fell in love
  with the Hernö gins that I tried (Old Tom, Six Rivers and Juniper Cask). When
  testing things that aren’t easy to compare like for like – such as spritzes –
  I try to compile a wide range of unexpected styles to hopefully float as many
  people’s boats as possible. Italicus was a standout example in my spritz
  testing, as was Bellamie; high-quality ingredients, light and summery and
  extremely drinkable. My drinks collection is hefty, as I often return to
  drinks when compiling my lists, and while I prefer to receive miniatures of
  samples from a practical point of view, there are inevitably products that I
  need to rehome. The bottle tombola at my kids’ school is a frequent recipient
  of weird and wonderful (unopened!) things, and the lucky residents of my part
  of north London will often find barely used bottles of booze on the
  waste-busting donation site Olio. What do I drink when I’m not testing them?
  Usually whatever white wine is my current flavour of the month, but I’ve got
  very into cremant, vodka martinis, scotch and old fashioneds. One of the
  things about testing is that it always galvanises my love of the category; I
  was a bit over gin before my recent test, but move over chicken wine, I’m now
  all about G&amp;Ts this summer. *** This week’s picks Tempur Pro Plus
  SmartCool mattress review: a dream for your joints or too soft for comfort?
  Travelling this summer? Here are 22 beauty and skincare hacks to survive the
  journey The best whisky: 13 tried-and-tested tipples, from scotch and single
  malt to blended and bourbon ‘A nostalgic 1980s-style chip’: the best
  supermarket oven chips, tasted and rated *** Editor’s pick As the UK has been
  battered by heatwave after heatwave, our reviewers have taken the opportunity
  to put all kinds of cooling devices to the test. This week, Alan Martin tested
  the best handheld and neck fans to keep you cool on the go (my top tip as
  someone severely heat-averse: pack a small spray bottle of water and spritz
  yourself before using the fan). And after trialling the best fans in the last
  heatwave, Caramel Quin tested air coolers, a type of fan that uses water to
  actively cool the air around you while remaining energy-efficient. (Don’t
  forget to pack one of the best water bottles, either.) Monica Horridge Deputy
  editor, the Filter *** In case you missed it … Short shorts are nothing new –
  just see John Travolta in 1985’s Perfect for proof – but they’re certainly
  having a moment, whether it’s Alexander Skarsgård on Lorraine or Paul Mescal
  at, well, anywhere. Stylist and menswear expert Peter Bevan explores the best
  short shorts you can buy and how to wear them (they’re much more versatile
  than you think). *** Get involved What gift have you given or received that’s
  lasted? In this age of poor-quality goods and built-in obsolescence, what have
  you bought that’s beautiful, well made and hasn’t fallen apart? What have you
  been given that you still love, and is still going strong, years later? Let us
