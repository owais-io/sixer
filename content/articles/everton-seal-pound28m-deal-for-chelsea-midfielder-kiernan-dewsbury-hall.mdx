  Everton have completed the signing of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea for a
  fee that could rise to £28m. The midfielder followed manager Enzo Maresca from
  Leicester to Chelsea last summer for £30m but was unable to secure regular
  Premier League football at Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old started 14 of
  Chelsea’s 15 games in their triumphant Europa Conference League campaign,
  scoring four goals and providing three assists. He also made five appearances
  at the Club World Cup won by Chelsea. Dewsbury-Hall has signed a five-year
  contract with Everton, who will pay a guaranteed £25m plus £3m in add-ons.
  “For me to leave my old club, it would have had to have been for something
  special, a project I really believed in,” Dewsbury-Hall said. “After speaking
  to the manager and seeing the ambitions with the new stadium and everything,
  it felt like the right club, it felt like the right fit for me for the next
  step. “[David Moyes] said he’s been admiring me for a while; he loves the way
  I play and just explained to me what he sees me doing in my role in this team.
  That’s what you want to hear as a player. “I have enormous respect for him,
  he’s a legend of the game, so it’ll be a pleasure to work under him.”
  Dewsbury-Hall is Everton’s fifth signing of the summer but attempts to add
  Tyler Dibling to the squad look likely to be frustrated. Everton have made
  three offers for the 19-year-old, the latest worth about £40m, but talks are
  at an impasse with Southampton holding out for more. Everton also have an
  interest in Jack Grealish, but have not opened talks with Manchester City over
  the England international. A season’s loan fee for Grealish could cost £12m
  and Moyes has other priorities, including a right-winger.
