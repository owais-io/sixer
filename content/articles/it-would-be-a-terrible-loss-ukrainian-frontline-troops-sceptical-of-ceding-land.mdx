  Over dinner on Monday, a simple barbecue of meat and roasted vegetables, the
  soldiers of Ukraine’s 150th reconnaissance and strike battalion have other
  things on their mind. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the White House and Donald
  Trump has just promised to give Ukraine “very good protection”. When this
  development is passed on to the group around, one of the soldiers pipes up
  “From who?” and laughs, such is the uncertainty about who the US really
  supports. But in reality the troops are not following the news closely. After
  three and half years, the war has its own momentum, technology and schedule.
  Soon after, a squad of soldiers drive out with a bomber drone into the night.
  It is assembled on the edge of a field where the sunflowers are nearly at
  their fullest extent. Two 3.5kg explosives are inserted, then wings and nose
  are attached, before it is launched from a catapult. Then, immediately, it is
  time to pack up and leave. “The most dangerous time is after launch,” a crew
  member says, wary of Russian surveillance quickly spotting the drone after
  takeoff. On the horizon, whatever the politicians discuss, there is no sign of
  the fighting easing. The frontline Ukrainian village of Dobropillia, now
  targeted by Russian bombing, is about 6 miles away. At one point there is a
  sequence of orange light flashes in the distance. Later, tracer bullets are
  visible against the clear sky – judging by the location, probably from
  Ukrainians trying to shoot down a Russian drone. On Tuesday morning, Donetsk
  officials said one person was killed and three injured in Dobropillia; three
  more were killed and four injured in Kostiantynivka, a town 30 miles to the
  east at risk of being surrounded. Russian soldiers had mounted 67 attacks in
  the area near Dobropillia in the previous 24 hours. The 150th tries to prevent
  Russian buildups and destroy its logistics before an expected autumn
  offensive. Denys Bryzhatyi, the battalion commander, a 32-year-old former law
  student who has risen rapidly up the ranks, says he is “without politics” when
  asked if there is a price worth paying by Ukraine to secure peace. But when
  pressed he says handing over the rest of Donetsk province, a demand of
  Vladimir Putin, could be a long-term disaster for Ukraine. “The loss of
  Donetsk region, the area that is heavily fortified against Russia, will just
  open up new directions for further advances – Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk,
  Zaporizhzhia, which are not well fortified. It would be a huge and terrible
  loss of positions,” the commander warns. Driving around the region new
  defensive trenches are visible, a second line against a slow Russian advance,
  filled with concrete dragon’s teeth and barbed wire. They are part of what
  would be given away. The bomber used by the night squad, an Airplast that
  could be mistaken for a large model aircraft, is a type used to attack
  buildings as far as 25 miles away. The drone’s flight is pre-programmed and
  each night the bomber drone crew may fly half a dozen missions, with targets
  having been selected earlier in the day by another unit from the 150th, based
  on separate reconnaissance drone missions carried out by troops in the same
  battalion. In the late afternoon, the day crew heads out with a German-made
  Vector drone. They set off as briskly as the rough roads allow, and arrive at
  a carefully made concrete dugout that is hard to see until you are close up.
  Getting going requires more than half an hour of setup: first the internet
  connection has to be established via Starlink, then a base station for the
  drone is wired up, before finally the Vector makes a vertical takeoff. After a
  few seconds it can no longer be heard. One of the crew has the job of
  monitoring signals from Russian first-person-view (FPV) drones, feared because
  their pilots are adept at flying their exploding craft into people and
  vehicles at speed. A small display periodically descends into static, meaning
  a drone is near. If a picture emerges it means an enemy drone is close,
  because each side can see the other’s FPV feeds. At one point it is thought we
  have been spotted. There is a hasty rush into the bunker, though the threat
  goes away. Below, a couple of crew members analyse the footage from the
  Vector. The footage is of extraordinary quality. “The lens cost $30,000,” the
  team leader, Kyrylo, explains. The pilot uses an unbranded Xbox controller.
  Once a target of interest is spotted, it can be clicked and locked on to.
  “Warfare is changing dramatically; we need to be more vigilant and adapt even
  quicker,” says Kyrylo, who has been fighting the Russians since 2014, when
  Ukraine’s army was in a chaotic mess. Bomb casings and other key components
  are made with a score or more of 3D printers by members of the 150th in the
  rear. The munitions they use, including in the Airplast bomber, are largely
  assembled at a second location where plastic explosive is inserted with
  shrapnel into the 3D-printed tubes at a rate, if necessary, of 100 in a hour –
  a military-industrial activity that is if anything accelerating. It is hardly
  surprising that Ukraine’s military does not consider itself close to defeat.
  Puma (Ukraine’s military only allows call signs or first names to be used), a
  soldier from Luhansk, which is now occupied by Russian forces, survived being
  shot twice in the chest on a reconnaissance operation in 2016, his life saved
  by his body armour. He remains involved in the most dangerous form of
  reconnaissance against the Russian invaders: on the ground. A week or so
  earlier, Puma was involved in an initial effort to find Russian infiltrators
  who had broken through the lines near Dobropillia. Several villages were
  cleared, he says, but a colleague was killed when a grenade thrown by a
  Russian bounced off a tree – a reminder that for all the innovation by drone,
  the war remains hard fought. Puma says he finds the diplomatic discussions a
  distraction. Another colleague, Optimus, is more forthright. “What’s the point
  of giving up Donetsk [region] to Russia?” he says. “After all the sacrifices
  we have made, the people we have lost? If we were going to do that, we could
  have done it right at the beginning of the war.”
