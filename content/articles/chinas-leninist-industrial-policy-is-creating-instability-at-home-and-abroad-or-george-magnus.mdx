  China’s astounding technological success in mass-producing quality electric
  vehicles (EVs) sits alongside a serious flaw in its industrial model:
  overcapacity. It has the capacity to produce about three times as many units
  as it can sell at home. The consequences so far have included widespread price
  cutting, large losses, misallocation of capital, and surging low-cost EV
  exports leading to trade conflict. The bigger problem, though, is that EVs are
  just a part of a broader overcapacity problem involving a myriad of sectors
  and products. At home, Chinese overcapacity lies at the heart of the
  destruction of profits, debt management problems, and persistent deflation.
  The broadest measure of inflation, the GDP deflator, has been falling for nine
  quarters as of June 2025, and the fall in factory gate prices for consumer
  durables is the biggest since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Abroad, the surge
  in exports, the other side of the coin of excess domestic capacity,
  colloquially now referred as the “second China shock”, is being met by trade
  defence measures including tariffs by both developed economies and an array of
  middle-income and emerging nations, such as Brazil and India. The threat posed
  by low-price Chinese products to local jobs and communities, deskilling, and
  premature deindustrialisation is ubiquitous. Overcapacity is not a uniquely
  Chinese problem, but China is nevertheless in a league of its own. It is
  generic, rather than specific to one or two industries. Most firms operate
  under a system of soft budget constraints, where weak and loss-making firms
  can survive, losses do not have to be distributed and bankruptcy laws are weak
  or barely followed. These conditions derive from the party’s strong emphasis
  on industrial policy and self-reliance that dates back to the 2000s and which
  is nowadays being prosecuted vigorously in an adversarial geopolitical
  struggle for technological and manufacturing dominance. Beyond EVs, consider
  high-speed rail (HSR). Investment in the sector began in earnest a bit more
  than a decade ago, with more than 11,000 miles in track in 2012 growing to
  nearly 29,000 miles this year. High-speed rail links between megacities, such
  as Beijing and Shanghai, and within the Pearl and Yangtze River deltas are
  very popular, and make money. Yet, as Dr Lu Dadao of the Chinese Academy of
  Sciences pointed out recently, China is overbuilding high-speed rail, along
  with roads and airports. With relentless high-speed rail expansion, China is
  getting less, even zero, new GDP growth. Roughly 80-85% of high-speed rail
  lines operate at a loss, and China Railway, the state operator, is getting
  ever deeper into debt, with liabilities of more than 6tn yuan (£640bn) in
  2024. Dr Lu has identified irrational and even illegal ventures, bribery and
  graft, inadequate passenger demand, stations constructed far away from cities
  they are intended to serve in areas of low population density, and
  extravagance for no purpose. Overcapacity has also dogged housing and
  infrastructure after almost two decades of nurtured boom, expansion and rising
  indebtedness. The housing sector faces years of shrinkage because of chronic
  oversupply – estimates vary between four and six years of sales of unsold
  housing inventory at a minimum – and much lower household formation. It is
  estimated that demand for housing in the coming decade will be about a half of
  what it was between 2012 and 2021. The overbuild of infrastructure –
  considering, for example, sewage pipe length, road construction, airports and
  commercial skyscrapers, especially in several hundred smaller and
  low-population cities away from the “wow” cities visited by tourists – is
  acute. In the markets for goods, especially those traded internationally,
  there is a long history of overcapacity in steel, aluminium, plastics and
  non-metal minerals, all of which have links to real estate and infrastructure.
  It is also evident in more modern sectors like clean technology, such as wind
  turbines and solar cell manufacturing – where capacity utilisation rates may
  be 50% or lower – lithium-ion batteries, machinery, textiles, chemicals,
  pharmaceuticals and microcomputers. Last month, Xi Jinping told the Central
  Urban Work Conference that local governments should not indulge overinvestment
  in AI and EVs. While recognising a serious structural flaw is at least a
  start, overcapacity is a systemic problem, not a random occurrence. China’s
  strong commitment to a weighty arsenal of industrial policy tools in the
  pursuit of geopolitical goals has significant drawbacks. To improve economic
  performance and flexibility at home, and defuse tensions in the world economy,
  China needs to cross a political Rubicon and switch to a more consumer- and
  services-based model, import more, and give markets more leeway, but this is
  the antithesis of the preferred Leninist industrial policy model that favours
  production and supply. Xi’s government seems set in its mercantilist ways, but
  at the cost of rising instability at home and abroad. George Magnus is a
  research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and at Soas University
  of London. He is the author of Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy
