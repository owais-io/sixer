  The Occupant review – air crash survival thriller gets Rob Delaney’s voice for
  company
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-26T06:00:20Z'
bodyText: >-
  Here is a survival sci-fi thriller in which Abby (Ella Balinska) is trying to
  save the life of her sister, who is stricken with apparently terminal cancer.
  Abby’s tenacious sense that the possibility of a cure exists is the major
  guiding force behind a narrative that goes to some strange and unexpected
  places. For most of the run time, Abby is trying to return home from the site
  of a helicopter crash in the remote wilds of of Georgia, where the odds of
  survival are minimal and her only companion is the disembodied voice of
  comedian Rob Delaney, who plays a pilot – or is he? – who has also crashlanded
  somewhere in the wilderness. Delaney, best known for his work in comedies such
  as the excellent Catastrophe, gives an excellent voice-only performance, but
  it’s Balinska’s show, and she delivers the kind of turn that made Sigourney
  Weaver a legend in Alien: brave but vulnerable, strong yet struggling. Casting
  directors should sign her up asap. But it’s a shame that both performers are
  stuck in a film that’s not as sharply sketched as they are. It’s a case of
  plentiful ideas and a plethora of rug pulls, but if you pull the rug out too
  many times, the audience ends up focused entirely on the rug, and losing
  attention on the character’s journey. With so many excellent elements in
  place, it’s frustrating that it doesn’t work better overall. • The Occupant is
  on digital platforms from 1 September.
