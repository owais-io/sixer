  Dominik Szoboszlai sent Liverpool top of the Premier League with a stunning
  free-kick against Arsenal and admitted he would not have taken the set piece
  had Trent Alexander-Arnold stayed at Anfield. The Liverpool midfielder
  maintained the champions’ 100% start to their title defence with the late
  “moment of magic” that Arne Slot said a boring game desperately needed.
  Szoboszlai has displayed his free‑kick prowess on the international stage with
  Hungary but was behind Alexander-Arnold on Liverpool’s list of takers before
  the defender’s departure to Real Madrid. He seized his opportunity from 30
  yards against the Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya, who claimed the new Puma ball
  being used in the Premier League this season had deceived him. Szoboszlai
  said: “I was confident in myself, I tried it. I should mention Trent because
  he was taking the free-kicks in the past. Finally I could have my chance and I
  did it. I had to take a risk and shoot a little bit harder because I knew Raya
  likes to jump behind the ball. He’s an unbelievable goalkeeper. If it goes a
  bit more inside he saves it.” Raya credited the Hungary captain with “a hell
  of a strike” but also cited the new match ball as a factor in Arsenal dropping
  points for the first time this season. “I remember the ball moving a lot and
  moving away from me,” the keeper said. “It’s different to the Nike ball so we
  have to adapt to it. The grip is different, the kick is different. We just
  have to adapt after playing with the Nike ball for many years. It’s the same
  for everybody.” Mikel Arteta defended his approach and argued Arsenal were the
  dominant side, despite creating few chances. The manager started Mikel Merino
  in place of Martin Ødegaard, who had not trained all week because of a
  shoulder problem, and left the new £67.5m signing Eberechi Eze on the bench
  until the 70th minute. “We didn’t do our game plan to frustrate them, we did
  it to win the game,” Arteta insisted. “I think we elevated the game and the
  dominance to a point that they had to raise their game. They did. Then you
  could see that there were no margins in the game and when that happens the
  game is going to be decided in two ways. One, with an individual error or two,
  with a magic moment. They created a moment that was incredible. That has won
  the game and that was the difference, nothing else.” William Saliba had to be
  substituted after only five minutes as he joined Arsenal’s lengthy injury
  list. Arteta said: “He twisted his ankle during the warm-up. He said he
  believed that he could carry on and play but he suffered in the first two
  actions. I could see that he couldn’t cope and we had to get him out,
  unfortunately. But thank God we have [Cristhian] Mosquera, who we put in for
  the first time in the Premier League, his debut, not expecting it at Anfield,
  and he was really, really good.” Slot praised his Liverpool team’s mentality
  and defensive display as the champions kept their first clean sheet of the
  campaign. Ibrahima Konaté and Florian Wirtz hobbled off late on but the head
  coach hopes both were experiencing cramp. “It wasn’t an injury, it was a
  welcome to the Premier League,” Slot said of £100m summer signing Wirtz.
  “After 85 minutes I don’t think he knew he could have cramp in so many
  different places and that’s what happened. That is welcome to the Premier
  League, welcome to playing in this intensity against an Arsenal team that can
  play really intense as well. That is normal if you bring in very good players,
  so talented, but from different leagues and young … 22 for him, 23 for Hugo
  [Ekitiké]. “It’s normal if you are not 27 then maybe you need to make a step
  towards the Premier League and that’s what these two are doing. In the
  meantime, we have nine points in games where we picked up five points last
  season. That is a positive but we can do better. The positive is some people
  thought we were too open against Bournemouth but you can’t say we were too
  open today.”
