  In 1954, just a few years after the widespread introduction of antibiotics,
  doctors were already aware of the problem of resistance. Natural selection
  meant that using these new medicines gave an advantage to the microbes that
  could survive the assault – and a treatment that worked today could become
  ineffective tomorrow. A British doctor put the challenge in military terms:
  “We may run clean out of effective ammunition. Then how the bacteria and
  moulds will lord it.” More than 70 years later, that concern looks prescient.
  The UN has called antibiotic resistance “one of the most urgent global health
  threats”. Researchers estimate that resistance already kills more than a
  million people a year, with that number forecast to grow. And new antibiotics
  are not being discovered fast enough; many that are essential today were
  discovered more than 60 years ago. The thing to remember is that antibiotics
  are quite unlike other medicines. Most drugs work by manipulating human
  biology: paracetamol relieves your headache by dampening the chemical signals
  of pain; caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and as a result prevents
  drowsiness taking hold. Antibiotics, meanwhile, target bacteria. And, because
  bacteria spread between people, the challenge of resistance is social: it’s as
  if every time you took a painkiller for your headache, you increased the
  chance that somebody else might have to undergo an operation without
  anaesthetic. That makes resistance more than simply a technological problem.
  But like that British doctor in 1954, we still often talk as if it is: we need
  to invent new “weapons” to better defend ourselves. What this framing
  overlooks is that the extraordinary power of antibiotics is not due to human
  ingenuity. In fact, the majority of them derive from substances originally
  made by bacteria and fungi, evolved millions of years ago in a process of
  microbial competition. This is where I can’t help thinking about another
  natural resource that helped create the modern world but has also been
  dangerously overused: fossil fuels. Just as Earth’s geological forces turned
  dead plants from the Carboniferous era into layers of coal and oil that we
  could burn for energy, so evolution created molecules that scientists in the
  20th century were able to recruit to keep us alive. Both have offered an
  illusory promise of cheap, miraculous and never-ending power over nature – a
  promise that is now coming to an end. If we thought of antibiotics as the
  “fossil fuels” of modern medicine, might that change how we use them? And
  could it help us think of ways to make the fight against life-threatening
  infections more sustainable? The antibiotic era is less than a century old.
  Alexander Fleming first noticed the activity of a strange mould against
  bacteria in 1928, but it wasn’t until the late 1930s that the active
  ingredient – penicillin – was isolated. A daily dose was just 60mg, about the
  same as a pinch of salt. For several years it was so scarce it was worth more
  than gold. But after production was scaled up during the second world war, it
  ended up costing less than the bottle it came in. This abundance did more than
  tackle infectious diseases. Just as the energy from fossil fuels transformed
  society, antibiotics allowed the entire edifice of modern medicine to be
  built. Consider surgery: cutting people open and breaking the protective
  barrier of the skin gives bacteria the chance to swarm into the body’s
  internal tissues. Before antibiotics, even the simplest procedures frequently
  resulted in fatal blood poisoning. After them, so much more became possible:
  heart surgery, intestinal surgery, transplantation. Then there’s cancer:
  chemotherapy suppresses the immune system, making bacterial infections one of
  the most widespread complications of treatment. The effects of antibiotics
  have rippled out even further: they made factory farming possible, both by
  reducing disease among animals kept in close quarters, and by increasing their
  weight through complex effects on metabolism. They’re one of the reasons for
  the huge increase in meat consumption since the 1950s, with all its
  concomitant welfare and environmental effects. Despite the crisis of
  resistance, antibiotics remain cheap compared with other medicines. Partly –
  as with fossil fuels – this is because the negative consequences of their use
  (so-called externalities) are not priced in. And like coal, oil and gas,
  antibiotics lead to pollution. One recent study estimated that 31% of the 40
  most used antibiotics worldwide enter rivers. Once they’re out there, they
  increase levels of resistance in environmental bacteria: one study of soil
  from the Netherlands showed that the incidence of some antibiotic-resistant
  genes had increased by more than 15 times since the 1970s. Another source of
  pollution is manufacturing, particularly in countries such as India. In
  Hyderabad, where factories produce huge amounts of antibiotics for the global
  market, scientists have found that the wastewater contains levels of some
  antibiotics that are a million times higher than elsewhere. Like the climate
  crisis, antibiotic resistance has laid global inequalities bare. Some
  high-income countries have taken steps to decrease antibiotic use, but only
  after benefiting from their abundance in the past. That makes it hard for them
  to take a moral stand against their use in other places, a dilemma that
  mirrors the situation faced by post-industrial nations urging developing
  nations to forgo the economic benefits of cheap energy. This may be where the
  similarities end. While we look forward to the day when fossil fuels are
  phased out completely, that’s clearly not the case with antibiotics, which are
  always going to be part of medicine’s “energy mix”. After all, most deaths
  from bacterial disease worldwide are due to lack of access to antibiotics, not
  resistance. What we are going to need to do is make our approach to
  development and use much more sustainable. Currently, many pharmaceutical
  companies have abandoned the search for new antibiotics: it’s hard to imagine
  a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes
  every time you use it. That means we need alternative models. One proposal is
  for governments to fund an international institute that develops publicly
  owned antibiotics, rather than relying on the private sector; another is to
  incentivise development with generously funded prizes for antibiotic
  discovery. And to address the issue of overuse, economists have suggested that
  health authorities could run “subscription” models that remove the incentive
  to sell lots of antibiotics. In one pilot scheme in England, two companies are
  being paid a set amount per year by the NHS, regardless of how much of their
  product is actually used. Finally, we have to remember that antibiotics aren’t
  the only game in town. Supporting other, “renewable” approaches means we get
  to use the ones we do have for longer. Vaccines are vital to disease
  prevention – with every meningitis, diphtheria or whooping cough vaccine
  meaning a potential course of antibiotics forgone. And the 20th century’s
  largest reductions in infectious disease occurred not because of antibiotics,
  but thanks to better sanitation and public health. (Even in the 2000s, the
  threat of MRSA was addressed with tried-and-tested methods such as handwashing
  and cleaning protocols – not new antibiotics.) Given that antibiotics
  themselves emerged unexpectedly, we should also be investing more in
  blue-skies research. Just as we no longer burn coal without a thought for the
  consequences, the era of carefree antibiotic use is now firmly in the past. In
  both cases, the idea that there wouldn’t be a reckoning was always an
  illusion. But as with our slow waking up to the reality of the climate crisis,
  coming to appreciate the limits of our love affair with antibiotics may
  ultimately be no bad thing. • Liam Shaw is a biologist at the University of
