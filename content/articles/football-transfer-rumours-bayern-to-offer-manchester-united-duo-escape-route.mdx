  After Manchester United so kindly signed Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair
  Mazraoui last summer, Bayern Munich may return the favour this time around.
  With Rasmus Højlund and Jadon Sancho coming to the end of their Old Trafford
  careers, the German side might offer the duo a chance to start a new life on
  the continent. Sancho has previously impressed in the Bundesliga at Borussia
  Dortmund and could welcome a return to the league. Getting a lesson from
  Tottenham was enough to make some people at Manchester City a bit twitchy.
  Efforts are supposedly being made in the market to add some quality in
  defensive areas. Paris Saint-Germain’s Gianluigi Donnarumma is said to have
  agreed terms over a move to the Etihad Stadium, while City are stepping up
  interest in Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi. City could sell two centre-backs
  before the window slams shut, with Nathan Aké and Manuel Akanji available.
  Another potential City departure is Savinho, who is wanted by Tottenham. The
  Londoners are willing to pay more than £60m for the winger. Thomas Frank could
  also make a £43m move for Como’s Nico Paz but the Italians want a fee closer
  to £60m. Leeds will bolster their defensive ranks with the signing of James
  Justin after a £10m deal was agreed with Leicester. Everyone is so eager to
  get it all done, that the right-back has already completed a medical and is
  readying himself to sit in an empty stand and hold a scarf aloft. With that
  pesky bookings investigation out of the way and the realisation of how bad
  West Ham are, Lucas Paquetá might be ready to wander to pastures new. One
  potential destination is Tottenham, who could even be tempted to pay £65m for
  the Brazilian. Aston Villa might also give Paquetá the chance to move up the
  table. Life in the Chelsea bomb squad is becoming quite tedious for those left
  on the outside of Enzo Maresca’s plans. Lesley Ugochukwu has left for Burnley
  and Carney Chukwuemeka looks to be on his way out with a £24m Borussia
  Dortmund return on the cards, but Axel Disasi is still there, twiddling his
  thumbs. Newcastle might be the ones willing to sign the defender, who spent
  time at Aston Villa on loan last season. Not happy with the signing of
  Eberechi Eze, Arsenal are still in the market for a record transfer. On this
  occasion, the fee is rather more modest, coming in at about £1.73m. It will be
  the highest fee paid for a League of Ireland player in history when
  16-year-old Victor Ozhianvuna joins from Shamrock Rovers. In League Two, the
  race for Alassana Jatta is hotting up and the striker is eager to leave Notts
  County. After Plymouth’s £900,000 bid was knocked back, others are waiting in
  the wings. Huddersfield and Bolton have shown an interest, while QPR have
  previously made an offer. They could face competition from Swansea or even
  Kayserispor.
