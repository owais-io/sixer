  The BBC must be given complete political independence in case Nigel Farage
  enters government, its former director of news has said. James Harding, now
  the editor-in-chief of the Observer, pointed to Donald Trump’s attempts to
  defund publicly backed US media and said it would be “recklessly complacent”
  to believe something similar could not happen in Britain. He said the BBC’s
  survival was at stake and noted that Reform’s last manifesto had claimed the
  “out-of-touch wasteful BBC is institutionally biased. The TV licence is
  taxation without representation. We will scrap it.” Harding said: “In other
  words, the one-time reality TV star who leads Reform has some bracing reality
  in store for TV. It’s recklessly complacent to ignore it. What’s happened in
  the US is, as likely as not, going to happen here. We have to address this
  now.” His comments come with Reform consistently leading in the polls and
  fears within Labour and the Conservatives about its rise. Harding called for a
  complete overhaul of the BBC’s political and financial independence, including
  the end of a regime under which the corporation enters negotiations over the
  renewal of its charter every 10 years. “It’s extraordinary, when you think
  about it, that if parliament chooses not to renew the royal charter in 2027,
  the BBC will cease to exist,” he said. “The BBC, which politicians can’t help
  but keep on a leash, is, in effect, on a 10-year rolling contract. “Political
  interference – and the perception of a political presence looming over the BBC
  – is a problem, one that we’ve got too accustomed to. And it looks likely to
  get worse. We need to get on with putting the country’s most important
  editorial and creative organisation beyond the reach of politicians now.”
  Harding issued his plea as he delivered the annual MacTaggart lecture at the
  Edinburgh television festival. He said the prime minister should be stripped
  of the power to pick the corporation’s chair and board. Instead, he said, it
  should operate like other corporations, in which the board selects the chair,
  with the approval of the communications watchdog, Ofcom. He also called for
  the BBC’s charter to be open-ended, like that of the Bank of England, with the
  licence fee or any future funding arrangement not decided “behind closed
  doors” by the culture secretary and the chancellor, but by an independent
  commission that advises the government and is scrutinised by parliament. “BBC
  independence means giving it the resources it needs, not freezing its funding
  yet again, but doubling down,” he said. “Over five years, nearly 2.5 million
  households have dropped out of paying the licence fee, so this needs fixing.
  It’s expensive and unfair on those who pay. If we believe in the universality
  of the BBC, we need to return to the principle in some form or other that
  every household pays.” The former Times editor also said the BBC should “lead
  the way in striking deals with generative AI companies on meaningful pricing
  of its reliable, ceaselessly renewed library of content”. Harding, who is
  Jewish, said he did not believe the BBC was “institutionally antisemitic”, as
  some have claimed after a series of rows over its handling of Gaza coverage.
  He criticised the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, for her repeated attacks on
  the BBC director general, Tim Davie, after the BBC’s admission that a Gaza
  documentary breached accuracy guidelines and its livestreaming of Bob Vylan’s
  Glastonbury set, which included chants of “death to the IDF”, referring to the
  Israel Defense Forces. “Whatever your view of the hate speech v freedom of
  speech issues, an overbearing government minister doesn’t help anyone,”
  Harding said. “The hiring and firing of the editor-in-chief of the country’s
  leading newsroom and cultural organisation should not be the job of a
  politician. It’s chilling.”
