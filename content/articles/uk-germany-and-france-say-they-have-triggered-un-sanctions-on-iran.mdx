  The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have
  triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran
  30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites or face deeper
  worldwide economic isolation. UK officials said the decision had not been
  taken lightly and there had been intensive diplomacy to try to avert this
  step. The officials emphasised there was still room for last-ditch diplomacy
  before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force in 30 days’ time. The annual
  high-level UN general assembly in September is likely to involve more
  intensive diplomacy over the situation with Iran. They added that Iran had
  been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal
  since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity to become compliant
  but had either been unwilling or unable to act. The International Atomic
  Energy Agency (IAEA) left Iran after Israel bombed its key nuclear sites, and
  has been unable to renegotiate a return to assess the state of those sites.
  Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the Bushehr site, where
  refuelling is due to occur. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told the
  Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the decision by the three
  European countries in a call on Thursday morning. Lammy said: “Despite
  repeated warnings, Iran has made no substantive effort to meet the conditions
  of our extension offer and has consistently failed to provide credible
  assurances on the nature of its nuclear programme. “Whilst we have been left
  with no choice but to take this action, the ball remains in Iran’s court and I
  would welcome their return to the table with a serious offer.” Araghchi called
  the European move “illegal, and unjustified”, adding the decision needed to be
  reversed in the coming days. He did not immediately spell out Iran’s response.
  In a sign of the hostility to the plans to cooperate with the IAEA, an Iranian
  MP, Amir-Hossein Sabeti, said he had read the draft text of the agreement with
  the agency word for word, and described it is as a “disaster” adding: “If it
  is a lie, deny it and we will be happy, but if it is true, then woe betide
  you.” Restoring sanctions would convert many existing – largely US and
  European – measures into UN-wide sanctions requiring observance by Russia and
  China, who finalised a draft UN security council resolution on Thursday to
  extend the nuclear deal for six months and urge all parties to immediately
  resume negotiations. Some sanctions on the Iranian arms industry that are not
  currently in force will be restored. In addition, the US, as a permanent
  member of the UN securitycouncil, will in future have a veto over the lifting
  of the UN sanctions, a power it currently does not have. The three European
  powers had to act now before the nuclear deal expired on 15 October and their
  power to reinstate sanctions ended. Justifying the decision, UK officials said
  the 2015 nuclear deal allowed Iran to store only 300kg of uranium enriched up
  to 3.67%. Instead, the stockpile was 45 times larger than this limit, with
  much of the uranium over the purity levels set by the 2015 agreement. Iran
  also had a 400kg stockpile of unaccounted highly enriched uranium. The
  officials said: “We have bent over backwards to reach an agreement but there
  simply has not been enough of a response on the Iranian side, including eight
  rounds of talks this year. “The most basic legal requirement, for the UN
  nuclear inspectorate to be able to access Iran’s nuclear sites, has not been
  met. Bluntly, we have run out of time. We cannot allow the Iran nuclear file
  to fall off the agenda or for sanctions to be permanently lifted while Iran’s
  nuclear programme escalates and IAEA access is denied in clear breach of its
  obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.” They said the
  snapback step was legal and proportionate, and the UK remained committed to a
  diplomatic solution. They added the UK had in June suggested a six-month delay
  in enforcing the sanctions on the condition that Iran allowed the IAEA back
  in. The officials said Iran had stopped implementing the additional protocol
  allowing enhanced inspections of its nuclear sites. Some experts fear Iran may
  respond by withdrawing altogether from the non-proliferation treaty at the
  most extreme, or hardening its opposition to the return of the IAEA. Although
  the Iran nuclear file is not at the top of the White House agenda, Iranians
  fear it is likely soon to attract the attention of Donald Trump and Israel,
  raising the possibility of further attacks. Iran is divided between those who
  want to accept US demands in return for the lifting of sanctions and those
  unafraid of further confrontation. The Iranian leadership, caught by surprise
  by the June attacks, has been reorganising its defence and security
  leadership, and it is possible it has not had time to reach an internal
  consensus. The Iranian parliament, dominated by conservatives, has set strict
  conditions for the return of the IAEA, but these can be overridden by Iran’s
  national security council.
