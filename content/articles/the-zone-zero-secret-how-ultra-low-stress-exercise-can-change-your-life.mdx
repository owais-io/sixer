  In our modern, time-squeezed lives, it’s tempting to do everything as fast as
  possible: listen to podcasts on double speed, work in email-free sprints, or
  train at lung-bursting intensity in the gaps between your morning meditation
  and the school run. But evidence is piling up that the last one might not be
  as beneficial as it seems – and that, in fact, just introducing a lot more
  ultra-low-intensity movement into your schedule can improve your fitness as
  well as your quality of life, whether you’re a top-tier athlete or experienced
  couch-crasher. Welcome to zone zero. In case you’re unfamiliar with the
  concept, or just need a quick refresher, zone training is a way of structuring
  workouts based on how high your heart rate gets as a percentage of the fastest
  it can possibly thump. Lower means slower – and most of us will never hit
  maximum intensity in our day-to-day lives. Over the decades, the
  most-recommended zones have shifted as training techniques evolve and
  knowledge of our biology improves – but zone zero, the state just slightly
  above total inactivity, where your heart never gets above 50% of its maximum
  rate, is enjoying a resurgence. One reason? It’s easy. Most zone training
  requires you to know your maximum heart rate – the British Heart Foundation
  recommends deducting your age from 220, though more accurate, less pleasant
  methods exist – and then making sure it doesn’t go too high or low, usually by
  training with a heart rate monitor. Zone zero, though, doesn’t require any of
  this. It’s essentially where you spend most of your semi-active life: walking
  slowly, doing light tidying, or even working at a standing desk. It shouldn’t
  really feel like exercise at all – but it might help you live longer, run
  faster, or feel better. “Zone zero is an accessible way to increase daily
  movement without the need for formal workouts or special equipment,” says
  Brian Passenti, founder of Altitude Endurance Coaching. “Getting more time in
  it can be as simple as parking further from the shops to get more steps in,
  taking a walk break while on a work call, or standing and stretching regularly
  at your desk. Of course, as you get more used to it, you can walk further or
  more frequently throughout your day, until you’re spending hours in zone zero
  rather than on the couch.” To understand why this is beneficial, it helps to
  know a bit about how your body fuels itself. After a meal or snack,
  carbohydrates are broken down and released into the bloodstream as glucose (a
  form of sugar), with any excess stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen.
  When you stand up or walk around, your muscles start contracting, which uses
  some of this glucose for fuel. This can have dramatic effects over time – a
  2022 review of studies found that even a little bit of light-intensity walking
  was enough to “significantly attenuate” post-food glucose levels compared with
  continued sitting, which almost certainly reduces your risk of insulin
  resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although there’s some criticism of the idea
  that people living in “blue zones” (those regions of the world where
  life-and-health span might be slightly longer than elsewhere) really differ
  from other populations, one thing that’s fairly consistent among them is a
  significant amount of low-level activity, especially after meals – something
  that the evidence suggests is a pretty good idea. Glucose is also released
  when you’re stressed, as part of the body’s fight-or-flight response – and
  managing that process might be one of the reasons that walking seems to be
  related to reduced stress, improved mood and general happiness. And there’s
  another key element to the fuelling process – low-intensity exercise uses a
  higher percentage of fat for fuel than high-intensity exercise, which tends to
  rely on the quick energy hit provided by glucose. This means that walking for
  a long time, or walking in a fasted state (like taking the dog out before you
  have breakfast) tends to pull energy from your body’s fat stores. Total
  calories burned matter, and so if fat loss is your main goal, adding more
  high-intensity exercise might get you there faster – but if that’s unpleasant,
  injurious, or makes you ravenous, it may do more harm than good. “For many of
  my clients – especially women in midlife or those just beginning their
  movement journey – zone zero is the bridge between sedentary and sustainable,”
  says Terry Tateossian, a personal trainer and nutritionist. “It reduces
  stress, supports mental clarity, can help with improved circulation and better
  digestion, and it’s a more enjoyable, flexible way to stick with training over
  time.” It’s also important to note that, in longevity terms, a bit (or a lot)
  more daily movement can play a huge role. A 2022 review of studies in the
  Lancet, for instance, found that taking more daily steps – fast or slow – was
  associated with a progressively lower risk of all-cause mortality, to an upper
  limit that varied by age. Another study led by the American Cancer Society
  found that any amount of walking, even at a moderate pace and at levels below
  the recommended guidelines, was associated with lower mortality risk.
  Consistency counts. But what about more athletic endeavours? Well, even people
  who schedule workouts five or six days a week will still probably benefit from
  adding some extra low-intensity movement to their routine. A few more daily
  steps can bring all of the benefits mentioned above. But can going (very)
  slowly actually help you run faster? This, it turns out, is a contentious
  area. Marathon data, for instance, shows that faster runners tend to spend a
  huge amount of time in the low-intensity zone compared with their slower peers
  – something that has prompted a recent examination in the European Journal of
  Applied Physiology. One theory is that faster athletes train a lot more in
  general – they’re spending more hours on the roads and trails, and so some of
  those have to be slow so they don’t burnout. This is the first of seven
  different hypotheses in the new piece, which notes that “complete cardiac
  recovery from [high intensity] exercises might take over two days, limiting
  athletes to two to three weekly well-rested HI sessions” – leaving four or
  five days a week that can be filled with low intensity work. There are also
  other explanations. Very low-intensity training may trigger training
  adaptations in a slightly different way to higher-intensity at the molecular
  level, or through different pathways. It might gradually remodel the structure
  and function of the heart (particularly the left ventricle), or shift the
  composition of an athlete’s muscle fibres to the more endurance-focused (and
  economical) slow-twitch kind. It might also reinforce the effect of more
  serious training, as suggested by a 2021 study that found decreasing daily
  background steps actually blunted the effects of a high-intensity training
  programme. “There have been studies comparing people doing training and
  getting 2,000 steps per day versus people doing the same training and doing
  5,000 to 7,000 steps per day, and those getting more steps get better training
  adaptations,” says Brady Holmer, an exercise scientist and the author of VO2
  Max Essentials. “We often think it’s best to do your training session and sit
  on the couch all day, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. You need the
  high-intensity training to get a faster race time, but zone zero training
  plays a supportive role.” It has been well established for some time now that
  “active recovery” – even if you’re barely doing anything – works to mitigate
  the effects of workouts that would otherwise leave you sore for days, by
  getting oxygen and nutrients to damaged muscle tissue through better blood
  flow. “An easy walk around the block is the best way to combat sore muscles,”
  says Passenti. “My wife is not as active as I am, but an easy after-dinner
  walk on a summer evening can offer benefits for both of us, and our dog too.
  While it may not directly improve sprint speed, it supports recovery and
  endurance development. Every bit of movement counts.” But also, staying in
  zone zero is just … easy. High-intensity training is horrible almost by
  design: you might come to “enjoy” it on some level, but it tends to have a
  negative effect on mood even in well-trained people. Going for a walk or a
  gentle yoga session, though, decreases mental fatigue and improves your mood,
  leaving you psychologically more prepared for the hard stuff. “Zone zero
  addresses the biggest challenge I see across all levels of athletes: the
  inability to slow down,” says endurance coach Stephanie Holbrook. “Over 16
  years of coaching, I’ve found that most endurance athletes start out too hard
  and are simply not willing to embrace truly gentle movement. Zone zero – that
  sweet spot where you’re just slightly active but not actually feeling like
  you’re exerting yourself – can be revolutionary. For beginners who have never
  exercised, it removes the intimidation factor and shows that movement doesn’t
  require suffering. For experienced 5k and marathon runners, it’s often the
  missing piece that unlocks breakthrough performances because it facilitates
  genuine recovery without contributing to the body’s stress response.” So where
  to start? Anywhere you like. The point of zone zero is to stop thinking of
  your day as a split between workouts (horrible) and inactivity (non-ideal),
  and try to maximise the amount of very gentle movement you’re doing without
  ever really worrying about it. In a typical day, that might mean going out for
  a quick walk before breakfast or getting off the bus to work a couple of stops
  early, getting up regularly for a stretch while you’re at your desk, and going
  for a 20-minute wander at lunchtime. It could mean a short amble after dinner
  or a bit of very gentle yoga while you’re watching Netflix (if you don’t know
  any, just sit on the floor instead of the sofa, and you’ll find yourself
  moving naturally). “Start with 10 to 15 intentional minutes of zone zero a
  day,” says Tateossian. “Add mobility while your coffee brews. Park further
  away on purpose. These micro-movements add up, and for people who feel
  intimidated by ‘exercise’, this is the entry point.” It sounds like a hassle,
  compared with what many of us are used to – but if it pays off with improved
  mental energy now and a better quality of life later, it will be worth the
  effort. And, if you’ve never quite cracked the code to enjoying exercise, it
  could be just what you need. “There can be a psychological breakthrough that
  comes from learning that sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is
  almost nothing at all,” says Holbrook. Besides, any form of exercise where you
  don’t have to wash your gym kit has to be worth a try. Get in the zone! Your
  on-the-go guide to exercise intensity Zone 0: casual stroll Heart rate: below
  50% of max Super-easy. Slow walking, gentle cleaning, or possibly just working
  at a standing desk. Spend as much time here as possible: it’s where our
  hunter-gatherer ancestors would have spent most of their days. Zone 1: getting
  going Heart rate: 50% to 60% of max Still barely challenging. This is where
  you’d be during an easy warm-up, walking the dog, or having a kickabout with a
  toddler. Useful for building work capacity for more challenging stuff. Zone 2:
  this is fine Heart rate: 60% to 70% of max Easyish. You’re breathing a bit
  harder, but you could still explain the plot of Severance if you really had
  to. Modern runners spend hours here to build a base without burning out. Can
  be boring, but very effective. Zone 3: this isn’t fine Heart rate: 70% to 80%
  of max This is where tempo runs – a pace that’s right at the edge of your
  ability for sustained efforts – happen. You could talk, but you’d rather not.
  A zone that’s fallen a bit out of fashion recently, as many coaches recommend
  a mix of long, slow training and higher-intensity efforts. Can still be
  useful, though. Zone 4: can’t talk, lungs hurting Heart rate: 80% to 90% of
  max Hard. This is what happens when you do intervals or threshold runs, or
  ill-advisedly sprint up an escalator as fast as you can. In theory, this is
  what nudges up your lactate threshold – or your body’s ability to deal with
  lactate buildup in the blood. You can’t sustain it for long, and you probably
  shouldn’t try. Zone 5: almost unbearable Heart rate: 90% to 100% of max
  Maximum effort: this is where you’re redlining it because someone’s yelling at
  you. Honestly, you probably don’t need to be here much.
