  Since Ghislaine Maxwell met with federal prosecutors last week, the imprisoned
  British socialite’s legal team has portrayed her as a beacon of truth willing
  to discuss all matters related to her child sex-trafficking co-conspirator
  Jeffrey Epstein’s many crimes. “Ghislaine answered every single question asked
  of her over the last day and a half. She answered those questions honestly,
  truthfully, to the best of her ability,” attorney David Oscar Markus told
  reporters. “She never invoked a privilege. She never refused to answer a
  question.” Maxwell’s highly unusual two-day sit-down with the deputy attorney
  general, Todd Blanche – who served as Donald Trump’s criminal defense attorney
  before working for his justice department – came as the US president tiptoes
  through a political minefield related to Epstein and his own social links to
  the disgraced former financier. But Blanche’s meeting – held amid rumors and
  denials of a pardon for Maxwell shortly before her sudden move on Friday to a
  Texas prison – did not just show Trump’s flagging efforts at damage control
  over the Epstein scandal. Maxwell is simultaneously pursuing several other
  strategies to be freed from her 20-year federal prison sentence. And, some
  experts believe, Maxwell’s ultimate aim is probably not really revealing the
  whole truth and everything she knows about Epstein, Trump and other powerful
  figures. Instead, it is all about earning her freedom. Maxwell’s team is
  pushing the US supreme court to consider her appeal, which contends that she
  was shielded from prosecution in Epstein’s controversial 2007 plea agreement –
  an argument that has been opposed by the same justice department that has now
  met with her. Maxwell is also trying to make the most of a congressional
  subpoena, threatening to invoke her fifth amendment right against
  self-incrimination unless she is given immunity. Her legal team has also
  suggested clemency – which Trump could grant immediately. This broad-spectrum
  approach, which several longtime defense attorneys said represented sound
  legal strategy, has prompted skepticism about whether any discussions reflect
  an actual desire to reveal truth. More, Maxwell’s track record of alleged
  lying undermines whatever truths Trump officials claim they want to reveal in
  highly publicized meetings. “If I were representing her, I would be doing
  exactly the same thing. The supreme court petition has virtually no chance of
  success. The issues raised are not novel or of general relevance to other
  cases,” said Ron Kuby, a longtime defense attorney whose practice focuses on
  civil rights. Kuby told the Guardian that the supreme court agrees to take on
  “only the smallest fraction” of petitions. “Filing a supreme court petition is
  akin to playing the lotto, you can’t win unless you play, but your likelihood
  of winning is slim, so it’s a last-ditch effort that defendants use when they
  have enough money for full due process.” The parallel strategy of actively
  pursuing clemency with the Trump administration is sound because Trump could
  commute her sentence or issue a pardon, Kuby said. “Because these are all
  federal convictions, he can let her out of jail tomorrow,” he added. As for
  why Maxwell would seem willing to shed light on Epstein despite a low
  likelihood of a positive outcome, “she has nothing to lose. “The question
  isn’t ‘why would she meet with them’? She’ll do anything for people who can
  help with this,” Kuby said. Eric Faddis, a trial attorney and founding partner
  of the Colorado firm Varner Faddis Elite Legal, voiced similar sentiments
  about Maxwell’s strategy. “For anyone who’s been sentenced to 20 years in
  prison, it would behoove them to explore all potential avenues to try and
  better their legal position, and it looks like that’s what Maxwell is doing
  here,” Faddis said. Other legal experts agree. “Maxwell’s attorneys are doing
  everything they can to keep her out of prison,” said John Day, a former
  prosecutor in New Mexico who founded the John Day Law Office. The Epstein
  controversy swirling around Trump may prove an excellent opportunity that few
  could have foreseen. “This is a moment in time that wasn’t there before, where
  she suddenly has an opening to try to get a change in her situation,” Day
  said. “Up until the Epstein case resurfaced and the Epstein-Trump issues came
  to the forefront of people’s attention, Maxwell was just doing her time.
  “Suddenly, she is trying to make the case that she has information, and she
  has information that’s worth trading for, and she’s hoping, her lawyers are
  hoping, that somehow someone is going to decide that it’s worth giving her a
  break.” Should Maxwell receive any favorable outcome, it might do little to
  promote truth and much to foment uncertainty. “If there is some kind of a deal
  that came out of the nine hours that Todd Blanche met with her, then any
  information that comes out of that is always going to be seen in the context
  of ‘what was the deal?’” Day said. Indeed, Trump’s handling of the Epstein
  files has done little but sow doubt. The Trump justice department released a
  memo insisting there was no Epstein client list, and decided not to release
  extensive case files, despite his campaign promise to do so. This backtracking
  on releasing documents helped fan the flames of controversy that came after
  the publication of a Wall Street Journal article claiming that Trump
  contributed a “bawdy” letter to a birthday present for Epstein – compiled by
  Maxwell. Shortly after the story ran, Trump announced that he had directed his
  justice department to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts in
  Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. This purported push for transparency,
  vis-a-vis Bondi’s request for unsealing, does not appear to have quelled
  backlash against Trump. The Wall Street Journal on 23 July reported that Bondi
  told Trump his name appeared in the Epstein files on multiple occasions.
  Epstein, whom prosecutors stated abused girls as young as 14, had long enjoyed
  the company of numerous high-profile men in his circle – among them Trump and
  Britain’s Prince Andrew. Epstein killed himself in jail awaiting trial six
  years ago. Trump’s camp has insisted that a pardon is not in the works, with a
  senior administration official saying: “No leniency is being given or
  discussed. That’s just false. The president himself has said that clemency for
  Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time.” But at other
  times, Trump’s comments on the issue have raised eyebrows, with him saying:
  “I’m allowed to do it, but it’s something I have not thought about.” He has
  also remarked: “Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody’s
  approached me with it. Nobody’s asked me about it” and that “Right now, it
  would be inappropriate to talk about it.” Top congressional Republicans are
  toeing the line when it comes to the idea of potential presidential relief,
  including the House speaker, Mike Johnson. “Well, I mean, obviously that’s a
  decision of the president,” Johnson said on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “I
  won’t get in front of him. That’s not my lane.” The political benefit for
  Trump from a pardon – however unlikely – remains nearly nil, as it would do
  little to support his prior claims about wanting the truth revealed. “The
  giant problem here – although what we have seen is that people are capable of
  believing all kinds of things if Trump says they are true – I don’t think
  there’s anything that Ghislaine Maxwell can say that will put any of this to
  rest,” Kuby said. “Certainly, the optics of giving an actual convicted child
  [abuser] clemency does not easily align with the right wing’s purported
  concern about child abuse.”
