  Mike Johnson became the highest ranked US official to visit the occupied West
  Bank on Monday, the Republican House speaker drawing measures of praise and
  condemnation for his trip in support of Israeli settlements amid a worsening
  starvation crisis in Gaza. The excursion followed Johnson’s arrival in Israel
  on Sunday on an unannounced visit with other Republican lawmakers, and his
  meeting with Israeli defense minister Israel Katz and foreign minister Gideon
  Saar. Johnson’s visit to the West Bank is the highest profile by a senior US
  political figure since then secretary of state Mike Pompeo went to Psogat in
  November 2020 during the final months of Donald Trump’s first presidency. It
  is a private trip hosted by a pro-Israel advocacy group, an Axios report said,
  and not an official congressional delegation. The outlet said Johnson traveled
  with fellow Republican representatives Michael McCaul, Nathaniel Moran and
  Michael Cloud of Texas, and Claudia Tenney of New York. Johnson told Israeli
  settlers on Monday that Israel was the “rightful owner” of the contested
  Palestinian territory, according to a report published on the pro-Palestinian
  website Common Dreams, and separately, Marc Zell, the chair of Republicans
  Overseas Israel. Common Dreams quoted Johnson as saying that “the mountains of
  Judea and Samaria are the rightful property of the Jewish people” and that the
  territory was at “the front line of the state of Israel, and must remain an
  integral part of it”. “Even if the world thinks otherwise, we stand with you,”
  he reportedly added, an apparent reference to recent proclamations by France
  and the UK that they would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel did not
  commit to a ceasefire in Gaza. His visit was immediately condemned by the
  Palestinian foreign ministry, which issued a statement calling Israel’s
  annexation of the West Bank a “blatant violation of international law”.
  Johnson’s stance in support of the settlers, it said, “undermines Arab and
  American efforts to stop the war and [the] cycle of violence, while flagrantly
  contradicting the declared US position on settlements and settler violence”.
  According to a post on X by Zell, Johnson also said the US should use the
  250th anniversary of its independence next year “to remind the American people
  of its Judeo-Christian foundations that were formed here in the land of
  Israel”. Johnson’s trip comes as pressure builds on Israeli prime minister
  Benjamin Netanyahu over the growing hunger crisis in Gaza, which some critics
  have called a genocide orchestrated by Israel. It also comes shortly after a
  Palestinian American from Florida was killed in the West Bank by Israeli
  settlers while visiting family. The Trump-appointed ambassador to Israel, Mike
  Huckabee, called the killing a “terrorist attack”. Johnson is expected to meet
  Netanyahu before returning to the US on Sunday.
