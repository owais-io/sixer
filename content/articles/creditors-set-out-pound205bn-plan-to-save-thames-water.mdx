  Thames Water customers are set to get less bang for their buck if a consortium
  of creditors wins approval for its rescue plan. The development was revealed
  in the outline of a business plan – without some key spending details –
  published on Wednesday by the investors who hold much of the company’s debts.
  The consortium is called London &amp; Valley Water. It wants to use about
  £20.5bn of consumers’ cash to prioritise key activities but deliver fewer
  projects than under a deal set out by water regulator Ofwat. People familiar
  with the London &amp; Valley Water proposal said last year’s final
  determination – the highly detailed plan of how much suppliers can charge
  consumers – was not deliverable and the new plan offered value for money. They
  said the new plan would make Thames viable and avoid putting the UK’s largest
  water company, which serves 16 million consumers, into a form of temporary
  nationalisation. The four-page summary of the plan describes “significant
  writeoffs by investors across the capital structure” but does not yet detail
  how significant these will be. Instead, it will “fix the foundations of Thames
  Water and set a clear pathway to addressing current compliance gaps”. The
  financial setup for Thames proposed by the creditors, including how much of a
  haircut investors will take on the debt, is being discussed with Ofwat this
  week. The proposal will then be submitted to credit ratings agencies to see if
  it would bring the water company back into investment grade territory, a
  requirement of its operating licence. Ofwat had agreed to defer a referral by
  Thames to the Competition and Markets Authority of the bill increases it had
  allowed in December last year. This deferral lasts until October, leaving a
  bargaining window in which to try to agree an alternative option. Some
  insiders at Ofwat said the plan amounted to a partial rewrite of the final
  determination but that this was all but inevitable in the pursuit of a
  market-based solution for the beleaguered water company. It has not been
  revealed how much money, alongside the £20.5bn from consumers, will be
  provided by the consortium. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “We continue to engage
  with the creditor group and will review their plan carefully to assess whether
  it delivers a turnaround in Thames’s operational performance, and strengthens
  its financial resilience to the benefit of customers and the environment. We
  expect to receive the full plan towards the end of next week.” Mike McTighe,
  the chair designate of London and Valley Water, said: “Our core focus will be
  on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of
  drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges
  Thames Water faces. “This turnaround has the opportunity to transform
  essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and
  rebuild public trust.” A Thames Water spokesperson said: “Today’s announcement
  underscores the London and Valley Water consortium’s commitment to fixing
  TWUL’s underlying challenges without relying on taxpayer funding. We look
  forward to working with stakeholders to deliver a market-led solution that
  benefits customers and the environment.”
