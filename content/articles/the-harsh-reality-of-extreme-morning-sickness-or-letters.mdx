  Abi Stephenson’s article about hyperemesis gravidarum – “extreme morning
  sickness” – carried me through memories, confirmation, horror and, at last,
  hope (Don’t call it morning sickness: ‘At times in my pregnancy I wondered if
  this was death coming for me’, 31 July). When I hear of a new pregnancy, I ask
  after the mother, recalling my two pregnancies in the early 1990s. Both ended
  with successful delivery, and I can’t imagine life without my two children.
  But I wonder whether my daughter will have inherited my predisposition to
  sickness throughout pregnancy, just as I did from my own mother. It is
  wonderful news to think there might be some safe medical option for her and
  many other women. I had many miserable days and nights with sick bowl to hand,
  eating one Rice Krispie every 30 minutes and always, always, throwing it back
  up. I theorised that a morsel of sugary goodness would get through, somehow.
  For my second pregnancy, under pressure to return to work after six weeks’
  sick leave, I spent a morning in the staff toilet before being allowed home
  again for another month. The nausea and vomiting started before a positive
  pregnancy test and ended within hours of giving birth. It took a lot of
  persuasion for me to embark on a second pregnancy and I’ve never regretted it,
  but memories soon fade. Since then I’ve had chemotherapy, which made me so
  sick that I required all the anti‑nausea drugs on offer. But being pregnant
  was worse, maybe because I hadn’t anticipated fighting to stay alive as part
  of the deal. Thanks, Abi, for giving voice to an issue that affects many of
  us, and causes women to die while pregnant – yet is ignored. Dr Wendy Bryant
