  Are You Really the Doctor?, Matthew Hutchinson’s memoir of being a black
  doctor in the NHS, opens in A&amp;E with a patient suffering from a
  thunderclap headache and taking time out from his excruciating pain to
  complain that Hutchinson is “very scruffy”. “I’m wearing scrubs, the
  pyjama-like, hospital-issue uniform – something pretty difficult to put your
  own personal flair on,” Hutchinson writes, concluding wearily that the guy
  must have been reacting to something else: “Skin, hair, or general … vibe.”
  You couldn’t call it a microaggression, the patient’s assumption that, being
  black, Hutchinson was unlikely to be an expert. But this anecdote barely
  registers on the Geiger counter of bigotry in healthcare that Hutchinson
  writes about trenchantly and acerbically, from the prejudices doctors face
  from patients and the gender and race blindspots in medical textbooks, to the
  racism that could endanger a patient’s life (black women are four times more
  likely to die during childbirth). Meeting Hutchinson in the Guardian’s offices
  in London, he emanates forethought and competence. Even in shorts and a
  T-shirt, he seems like the kind of guy who couldn’t look scruffy if he tried.
  He says the book he’s written about race had to be done, but “I’ve spoken to
  people who are non-white and female, and without even prompting, they’ve said:
  ‘Actually, the thing that is held more against me is being a woman.’”
  Hutchinson’s wife, Louise, is a GP. “The lack of respect that can be shown to
  female doctors is outrageous, sometimes by certain other healthcare
  professionals, not even patients. In the same way, we haven’t really had a
  book, as far as I’m aware, about being disabled as a doctor and the lack of
  access to medical school for someone with a disability. I’ve met only one
  doctor with a hearing impairment in the entire time I’ve been working.” It’s a
  curse, being this fair-minded, stepping back from each point to look at every
  perspective, but it also gives an immediate sense of the kind of doctor he is.
  It speaks also to the speciality he’s chosen, rheumatology, which perhaps out
  of any field is the one that can cope with the most mystery: pain without a
  source. At 38, he is about to become a consultant. Hutchinson also does
  standup comedy, and his act and the writing ambitions that led to the book are
  the product of his years working as what used to be called a senior house
  officer in the NHS – the period before specialising – in the mid-2010s. It’s a
  time when “you’re becoming senior enough that people expect you to know what
  you’re doing, yet you’re still getting all the rubbish work. I was just a bit
  disaffected with medicine, wondering what other things I could do. Eventually,
  I did some standup, and just really got into it.” His routines started off as
  a softcore, leftie side-eye at the ridiculousness of politics, parenting, life
  and everything (Suella Braverman, “the Michael Jordan of multiculturalism”,
  railing against multiculturalism; Formula One being so white it’s amazing that
  Lewis Hamilton doesn’t get pulled over on the race track). The skills, he
  says, aren’t completely dissimilar to medicine: “Trying to get a room full of
  people on side to believe that you know what you’re doing.” The book is often
  a sharp-intake-of-breath funny (one medic on a dementia ward called it
  “veterinary medicine”), but doesn’t play it for laughs. He describes a
  situation like the grinding suffering of a lupus patient with such a close eye
  for detail that you feel as if you’re walking alongside him. Hutchinson’s
  parents were both biochemists, now retired, and his younger brother is an
  anaesthetist. His dad arrived in Birmingham from Jamaica aged 19; his mother
  is Scottish. He grew up in south-east London, where he still lives, in an area
  that has gone from rough-with-leafy-pockets to
  only-just-affordable-on-two-doctors’-salaries. Not far from Eltham, where
  Stephen Lawrence was murdered, racism was hardly unheard of, but it wasn’t
  until Hutchinson went on a camping trip to Cornwall as a teenager that he
  discovered the unabashed bigotry of rural, monocultural Britain. Some local
  teenagers tried to pick a fight with him, uttering the bizarrely sinister
  line: “What are you doing here, dark horse?” The experience stayed with him
  when he decided to become a doctor, because in your first year of working, the
  NHS can send you anywhere. “That is one of your key preoccupations, almost
  from day one at medical school: how do I not get sent away? Even if it’s not
  being sent very far across the country, even just having to spend a year out
  of London in a place where suddenly Reform are on the rise, and there are St
  George crosses appearing everywhere and migrant hotels being burned down,
  that’s going to be a consideration.” There’s no easy solution – medics used to
  be placed according to a complex points system; now it’s done by lottery. Both
  methods have their critics, and “everywhere needs doctors,” Hutchinson says.
  He’s not trying to land an easy fix, merely noting that in the current
  environment, where politicians generate racial tension with their euphemistic
  “concerns about immigration” and endless discussions about whose anger is
  legitimate, you don’t often hear from the black healthcare professionals who
  have to go and live in that anger. In the event, he spent his first year in
  2012 “at the bottom of that pyramid” (foundation year 1), in Essex. “I don’t
  think I could do now, as an experienced doctor, what I was asked to do in my
  first placement,” he says. As the general dogsbody of doctors, FY1s are often
  the only doctor doing out-of-hours ward cover. “Overnight, you’re the only
  port of call for about 400 medical beds which, given how sick these people
  are, is absurd. As a sort of crude estimate, 40 patients might need urgent
  care. And it’s you, the most junior person, turning up. It’s improved in some
  places, so you’ll have two registrars on overnight. I would still say the
  night shift is just doing as little as possible to the people who are already
  in hospital, to survive until the morning.” Things have changed since more
  than two decades ago, when junior doctors were famous for the inhuman length
  of the shifts they had to work; but every solution seems to create a new
  problem. Shorter shifts with longer rest breaks were phased into the 2016
  junior doctors contract in England to accommodate the fact that even medics
  cannot survive on no sleep. Hutchinson found successive night shifts “very
  mentally destabilising, I get terrified of the notion of death. I’ve had that
  since I was 17 or 18, but I don’t think about it unless I’m sleep-deprived.”
  But despite junior doctors working shorter shifts, no extra staff were
  magicked up to fill the gap, so the result has been pervasive understaffing.
  Only during the pandemic, “when everyone got dragged out of elective care and
  out of clinic” did they suddenly have enough healthcare professionals in
  urgent care. “It’s probably some of the most well-staffed work I’ve ever done
  in my entire career,” he says. But there was a flipside, as there always seems
  to be. “What we’re seeing now is that it was a complete disaster for secondary
  care. It was then as if no other disease existed. So you found all these
  people 18 months later in a heap because their rheumatoid arthritis hadn’t
  been assessed and managed properly.” Hutchinson has some pretty salty views
  about the other medical specialities, particularly cardiology, which attracts
  “people who can be quite blunt, aggressive, and have a high opinion of
  themselves”. His early years, first in Essex, later back in London, are
  peppered with incidents with cardiologists. Is it a class thing, I ask,
  considering the conveyor belt he describes: “If you pick your 18-year-old who
  wants to go to Imperial or Cambridge, most of them want to be brain surgeons,
  or want to be cardiac surgeons.” But no, “even now that there’s more diversity
  in the demographic, it’s still quite an aggressive speciality. Behaviour in
  the past was far worse, but those people haven’t gone away, they’ve just
  moderated their language. Having said that, I don’t want to give
  rheumatologists too much of an easy ride – there are plenty of abrupt
  rheumatologists.” In between surviving till dawn in Essex in his first year,
  to arriving back in London for his second foundation year – at a hospital he
  describes as “the kind of well-resourced centre of excellence where pampered
  professors carve out fiefdoms”, he met his wife at a party of his brother’s.
  They now have two children, one about to start pre-school, the other four
  months old. He has enormous respect for the work of GPs like his wife. “It’s
  such a difficult job, the idea that you can be expected to work out what’s a
  cold versus what’s the first signs of lung cancer in 10 minutes. The diversity
  of the work and the brevity of the appointments and the level of risk they’re
  expected to take on is ridiculous.” Rheumatology has totally different
  challenges, in particular, getting patients to describe the exact kind of pain
  they are in. In the book, his own descriptions of pain – from kidney stones to
  rheumatoid arthritis – are often so heartfelt and precise that it sounds more
  like poetry than work. “The nature of pain is often hugely diagnostically
  important,” he says, “so you do spend quite a lot of time ruminating on the
  specific nature of it. A thunderclap headache is literally like being hit in
  the head with the back of a hammer… cardiac chest pain is more like pressure
  or crushing. Sharp, stabbing pain may be more associated with a blood clot in
  the lungs. And words are obviously modulated by culture, language and
  background.” Within medicine, rheumatologists are the people you call in when
  every other test has come up blank. “It’s quite closely coupled to immunology,
  a kind of highfalutin, investigative field of weird and wonderful diseases,”
  he says. But it’s also frustrating. “There are two ways you can do it. So you
  can say: my job is to make a binary decision. I either think you do have an
  immune-mediated inflammatory disease, in which case you’re my problem, or you
  just have chronic pain and some other non-immune-mediated thing, in which case
  you’re not my problem. Goodbye. I think that’s certainly what the managers
  probably want you to do, because it gets you through lots of patients.” The
  other way is to accept that your patient “may not have a disease that fits
  neatly into your of set of immune-mediated diseases. If you have the time to
  have a chat with them, maybe run 20 minutes late as a result, and say: ‘I
  understand you’re in pain, we can’t quite get to the bottom of it and I don’t
  want to give you a drug that’s gonna make you worse, but I still want to
  engage with the problem.’” From a patient’s perspective, just to feel as if
  someone has heard the pain is real is better than feeling written-off because
  they can’t find the cause. Yet to take that holistic view of a patient is to
  be constantly confronted by all the things you cannot solve. “You can give
  people the best kind of medical intervention they could hope for, but you’re
  still probably not going to be able to do everything else that’s going to be
  required for them to actually feel fulfilled and happy. You’re not going to
  fix the lift in their block, so they don’t have to walk up 20 flights of
  stairs with rheumatoid arthritis. That’s the other frustration.” Medicine has
  to operate in the conditions of the world around it, often with very little
  influence on that world. Take a cancer diagnosis – which, on the surface,
  might seem like a leveller. But if you take “someone who’s a
  multi-millionaire, and someone who’s living on a council estate – fine, they
  both have cancer, but the environments in which they’re having cancer are
  vastly different. The worries that they have for their children, their ability
  to attend appointments, these little things can change how you engage with
  your treatment.” Nowadays, Hutchinson spends three days a week in his clinic,
  and two days researching rheumatology and internal medicine at the Crick
  Institute in King’s Cross. If he has any nerves about the book coming out,
  it’s mainly whether or not cardiologists can take a joke. Being involved in
  the worlds of comedy and publishing “made me see that, actually, there are
  some really good things about medicine. When I see what other people are
  having to go through with their jobs, the certainty and the progression of the
  NHS looks great.” On the cusp of becoming a consultant, presumably braced for
  a new round of “are you really the consultant?”, he’s determined not to change
  his bedside or overall manner for the job. “A lot of people, when they become
  consultants, completely change the way they dress, come in suddenly wearing a
  brand new suit. I would imagine that’s mainly cardiologists.” • Are You Really
