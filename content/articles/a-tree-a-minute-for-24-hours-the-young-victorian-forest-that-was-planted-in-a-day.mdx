  On a patch of paddock in West Gippsland stands a small forest, which wasn’t
  there before. Flowering gums and she-oaks reach up nine metres tall, birds
  nest in their branches, while a giant tiger snake slides through the grass
  below. All it took was one day of “bloody hard” work. About four years ago the
  Australian film-maker and outdoorsman Beau Miles set out to plant 1,440 trees
  and shrubs in 24 hours – enough to turn a blanket of rolling Victorian hills
  back into bush. Miles decided he was done with the kind of modern-day
  adventures that burned through money and carbon, delivering little in the way
  of tangible outcomes except for photos and a great story. Instead, he says, he
  began looking for physical challenges that offer more “bang-for-buck”. The
  project was inspired by a joy flight Miles was given for his 40th birthday. “I
  flew directly over my house, where I’ve grown up,” he says. “It was remarkable
  how green it was but it was a green rolling blanket, rather than a green
  rolling forest … when you see it from the air it’s so blank.” Noticing how
  bare it was, he set himself the goal of planting a tree a minute for 24 hours
  to turn it into bushland again. Sign up to get climate and environment editor
  Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter The little forest is on a
  nearby plot of land owned by his friend, otherwise used for farming. Working
  at that rate was “bloody hard”, Miles says. “I thought it would be hard but I
  didn’t think it would be that hard. “I got to about a thousand trees and then
  had a few hours’ sleep – I thought I was stuffed.” A second wind in the last
  hour allowed him to finish the job. He says the result four years on is
  “totally worth it”. In a video posted last week Miles returns to the land
  where he planted four years ago. There are trees big enough to climb, a
  resident wombat, a cockatoo feather. “It’s a good-looking little bit of
  forest,” he says in the video. “I planted it. So maybe I’m a bit biased.” The
  most rewarding moment, Miles says, was boiling a billy in the forest’s grassy
  understorey and enjoying a cup of tea. “I felt it was a really lovely, almost
  profound moment – like I’d just had another kid – in that I’d made an impact
  of some kind.” Prof David Karoly, an expert in climate change science and
  councillor with the Climate Council, says while the fossil fuels industry
  remains the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, every
  tonne of carbon dioxide avoided or removed from the atmosphere matters. That
  means individual and community climate actions – walking or cycling instead of
  driving, investing your super ethically, installing solar panels, planting a
  garden or trees, as well as voting – make an important difference. “Individual
  actions do accumulate and do reduce Australia’s emissions, even if they’re
  voluntary,” he says. Karoly, who was not involved in Miles’ project, says
  planting and maintaining trees over a long period of time helps to remove CO2
  from the atmosphere and brings other benefits, including establishing
  ecosystem corridors for animals. “Since colonisation, Australia has lost more
  than 70% of its native vegetation through agriculture and urbanisation.” The
  burgeoning forest in West Gippsland is to double in size in the next six
  weeks. Buoyed up by success, Miles says the plan now is to turn “views into
  trees” – investing ad revenue from YouTube views back into more tree stock,
  with another round of planting set for October. Worries about environmental
  and climate change aren’t going to go away anytime soon, he says. “We’ve lost
  half of our forest in 200 years and 38 mammals. It’s kind of devastating, but
  very abstract … “This is not about being a greenie. I just see it as
  necessary. Like having a good breakfast in the morning or being nice to your
  kids – you just should do it. “Just get on with doing what’s in front of you,
  helping your patch and being busy. Because all of a sudden you find yourself
  in this beautiful feedback loop of reward.”
