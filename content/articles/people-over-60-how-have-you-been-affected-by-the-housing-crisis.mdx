  By 2030, the UK is set to become a “super-ageing society” with one in five
  people over the age of 65, and there is growing concern about how our elderly
  population will be impacted by the housing crisis. With rent soaring and home
  ownership out of reach for many, there are fears elderly people will
  increasingly be forced to live in homes they struggle to afford, that are
  unsuitable for their physical needs, or which exacerbate loneliness in their
  later years. Research from Crisis has found nearly one in five people said
  they wanted to retire but couldn’t because of their housing costs, and the
  number of older people in England facing homelessness has rising by over 50%
  over the last five years. We would like to hear from people over 65 about
  their experiences of the housing crisis. For instance, are you at risk of
  homelessness, or have been made homeless, due to rising living costs? Are you
  stuck in an unsuitable home but financially or physically unable to move?
