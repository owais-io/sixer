  In 2023 a Canberra mechanic was servicing a grey BMW when he made a startling
  discovery. Under the seat he found a handgun. The pistol looked strange. It
  was made almost entirely of plastic – half white, half black. The mechanic
  didn’t know it but the car belonged to a street-level drug trafficker who’d
  come down from Sydney seeking “fast money” slinging meth across Canberra’s
  suburbs. The gun had been made by an associate with a 3D printer, according to
  court documents. It was untraceable and lethal, and part of a trend that
  experts say threatens to fundamentally upend Australia’s world-leading gun
  controls. Andrew Hemming, an expert in criminal law at the University of
  Southern Queensland, says the laws on 3D-printed firearms are a “dog’s
  breakfast”. Manufacturing or possessing any type of firearm without a licence
  is illegal across Australia but specific laws on 3D printing vary between the
  states. Some have criminalised the manufacture of 3D-printed weapons or owning
  blueprints while others rely on existing firearm laws. Hemming says the united
  action Australia took to tighten gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre,
  in which 35 people were murdered, is now coming undone. “We all got together
  after Port Arthur and everybody pulled together with the ban [on some
  semi-automatic and pump-action firearms] and the buyback,” he says. “Well, the
  reality is … if anybody can make one, the sands have shifted and it’s only a
  question of time.” More sophisticated and more lethal The firearm found in
  Canberra resembled images of a popular 3D-printed pistol model known as the
  Harlot, court documents say. According to numerous online communities that
  celebrate and promote 3D-printed guns, the Harlot is entry-level. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email “It’s quick, and cheap to print, easy to assemble, and the
  hardware required to complete the build is readily available,” one website
  hosting instructional material says. But more reliable and more deadly models
  are now showing up. Det Supt John Watson, commander of the drug and firearms
  squad in New South Wales police state crime command and the head of the
  national illicit firearm working group, says police have been uncovering
  3D-printed weapons for more than a decade. Over the past three to four years
  the trend has been from “very novice, very low-powered, almost a one-shot
  weapon” to higher-quality weapons, he says. In 2025 police say they have so
  far made seizures of homemade firearms in almost every state and territory. In
  one suburban home police allege they found 3D printers as well as 3D-printed
  pistols, magazines and firearm parts. The stash allegedly included a
  3D-printed semi-automatic carbine in parts, commonly known online as the
  Urutau. The blueprints of the Urutau were released online only last year but
  already components have allegedly been found during police raids in multiple
  states. In another case, police allegedly found a “Nutty 9” firearm – a
  spin-off of the FGC-9 – and a 3D-printed pistol as well as the digital
  blueprint for the manufacture of firearms. Images released by police show a
  vast array of components allegedly found during the raid, including an
  incomplete Urutau. Gun parts in the post Rajan Basra, a researcher at King’s
  College London, says the 3D-printed gun world has become a “social movement”.
  The Urutau and other models, including perhaps the most infamous 3D-printed
  firearm, the FGC-9 – or “Fuck Gun Control” – emerge from online communities
  that share information and promote the creation of weapons both as a means to
  push the boundaries of science and, according to some designers, “permanently
  undermine global firearm prohibition”. The Urutau was intentionally designed
  without the need for regulated parts in some countries – all “with basically
  [online retail] stuff”, as the man behind the gun’s design said on a podcast
  in May. An open letter that accompanies the build kit online promotes “the
  unlimited right to keep and bear arms”. On Discord servers and filesharing
  websites, this community posts memes and gun rights quotes alongside long
  lists of projects and links of recommended retailers for buying build kits as
  well as barrels and parts that cannot be reliably 3D printed. In one case,
  Australian Border Force allegedly intercepted several shipments sent from
  China. The packages were allegedly described as “pipes” or “high pressure oil
  pipe”, according to court documents. Police allege they were “unfinished
  firearm barrels”. Some groups promote what they call a “new second amendment”,
  according to Dr Yannick Veilleux-Lepage, an associate professor at the Royal
  Military College of Canada. Broadly, this is the belief that the right to bear
  arms is universal, not just part of the US constitution. “This all falls
  within the same movement, which is essentially trying to push the boundaries
  of privately manufactured firearms,” he says. “The main impact here is the
  erosion of state control on firearms.” Worried? ‘Build one yourself’ It’s
  unclear how many 3D-printed guns are being seized in Australia each year
  (there is no centralised record), yet an examination of court documents
  suggests various models are emerging, created both by hobbyists and those
  intending to use them for criminal purposes. In 2023 a man was sentenced in
  Melbourne for possessing a traffickable quantity of firearms, six of which
  were 3D-printed handguns, court documents show, including 0.22 rimfire calibre
  pistols, as well as aggravated carjacking, among other charges. Some suggest
  3D-printed firearms may not be popular among cohorts linked to organised
  crime, because of a lack of reliability and their aesthetic. “They communicate
  to other people that you’re not able to source a conventional firearm,”
  Veilleux-Lepage says. But this could change. Some popular models, such as the
  “Not-a-Glock”, he says, look like a conventional firearm and are cheap to
  build. Extremist groups that might not otherwise be able to easily access the
  illicit market also pose a threat. “Over the last few years … it’s very
  typical for the gun blueprints to be shared by far-right influencers, along
  with the instructional material and incitement for followers to make guns at
  home,” says Basra, who unmasked the man behind the FGC-9 as the already
  deceased German citizen Jacob Duygu. Artem Vasilyev was sentenced to at least
  three years in jail in the South Australian supreme court in 2024 after
  pleading guilty to more than a dozen firearm offences. In his sentencing
  remarks the judge referred to a report prepared by a forensic psychologist,
  which said Vasilyev “was in the process of becoming radicalised” and had
  material “espousing extremist rightwing ideologies” on his electronic devices.
  The court heard that a plastic tub containing 3D-printed gun parts that could
  be used to make a FGC-9 firearm was found in his home. In a NSW hearing about
  whether to put in place an extended supervision order, the court heard how a
  man who had shared extremist beliefs was found to have downloaded hundreds of
  3D-printing files for a number of firearms. Urutau’s anonymous originator, who
  goes by the handle Joseph the Parrot, was asked on a podcast this year about
  extremists using his design. “I mean, I don’t support them but if they build a
  gun I can’t do anything about that,” he said. “If you are upset about a white
  supremacist building a Urutau, you can build one yourself to counter him.”
