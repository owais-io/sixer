  Dan York-Smith, the former senior Treasury official Keir Starmer has appointed
  as his principal private secretary, is a qualified international gymnastics
  judge – a skillset that may come in handy as Labour limbers up for the
  formidable balancing act of Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget. After a dizzying
  series of backflips on tax and spending, some of which were blamed squarely on
  the chancellor, the government is preparing to raise taxes – at the same time
  as acknowledging that with inflation on the rise again, the public are still
  in the grip of a cost of living crisis. As well as York-Smith, who previously
  coordinated fiscal events at the Treasury and is well liked by colleagues
  across Whitehall, Starmer has pinched Reeves’s No 2, Darren Jones, to be his
  own “chief secretary” – a previously nonexistent job. The former Bank of
  England deputy governor Minouche Shafik, a well-respected economist, will be
  Starmer’s economic adviser. Economists and former government advisers welcomed
  the reshuffle, suggesting it was high time for Starmer to take more interest
  in the direction of economic policy. Jonathan Portes, a former senior
  government economist, said it was always a mistake to subcontract tax and
  spend entirely to the Treasury. “It is a well-functioning department staffed
  by people who know what they’re talking about and if it’s not politically
  challenged by No 10 things go wrong,” he said. “Because of the way the
  Treasury works, it’s intellectually predisposed to do things that are not just
  politically counterproductive but economically counterproductive. You need
  somebody in No 10 to push back, and that’s in the interests of the government
  as a whole.” Tim Leunig, the chief economist at Nesta, who advised Rishi Sunak
  when he was chancellor, agreed that part of the problem had been a lack of
  direction from No 10. However, he suggested any number of new appointments
  would make little difference without a clearer sense of what the prime
  minister wants. “I think all this adds up to absolutely nothing, until Keir
  Starmer decides what he stands for, and what he stands against,” he said. In
  particular, Leunig said that would mean deciding which groups to single out to
  bear the brunt of tax rises – which are widely viewed as inevitable, with the
  Office for Budget Responsibility expected to downgrade its growth forecasts.
  “Unless Labour are willing to say: ‘We’re never going to be a good government
  unless we’re lucky enough to get growth,’ then they’ve got to learn to pick
  some losers,” he said. Another former Labour adviser said these risks were
  particularly grave during tough economic times, when the Treasury tends to go
  into “finance ministry mode” – focusing above all on balancing the books.
  However, Labour’s first year in power has underlined the political challenges
  of either cutting spending or raising revenue – particularly given the
  manifesto promises they made not to touch key taxes, including income tax.
  Business groups have reacted with fury to Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer
  national insurance contributions, which has been blamed for putting the brakes
  on hiring and exacerbating inflation, while backbenchers forced the
  abandonment of £5bn-worth of disability benefit cuts. The removal of the
  winter fuel allowance from most pensioners was also almost completely reversed
  after months of damaging criticism. Memories of previous disastrously received
  fiscal statements abound – including George Osborne’s “omnishambles” budget
  and, of course, Liz Truss’s “mini-budget”, much of which subsequently had to
  be ditched in the face of market chaos. With bond markets already skittish,
  the pitfalls are obvious. As one Labour insider put it, the government’s task
  in the budget – which is still at least 10 weeks off, with no date yet
  announced – is to “fill a hole, in a way that makes it not look like they’re
  filling a hole”. Reeves, meanwhile, has not yet found a replacement for her
  former chief economic adviser John Van Reenen, who has cut back his role at
  the Treasury – although she has roped in the pensions minister and wonks’ wonk
  Torsten Bell to be her wingman on budget prep. Jones will be succeeded by the
  safe pair of hands James Murray, moving up from the post of exchequer
  secretary to the Treasury. Murray’s successor is another graduate of Bell’s
  former thinktank the Resolution Foundation – the MP for Chipping Barnet, Dan
  Tomlinson. Shafik, too, had some involvement at Resolution, serving as one of
  the commissioners on its landmark Economy 2030 review – although she is better
  known as an expert on the international economy. Margaret Thatcher famously
  used her economic adviser Alan Walters as an intellectual battering ram
  against the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, ultimately leading to the latter’s
  resignation in 1989. Few at Westminster expect Shafik to play such a divisive
  role, however. “She’s not like an Alan Walters figure: she’s not an
  ideological person,” one Labour insider said. But given the political
  somersaults required, Portes argues that it will take serious political
  commitment from the very top of government to make another tax-raising budget
  stick. “No 10 and No 11 have to argue it out, agree, and then come out and
  sell it together,” he said. “And Starmer has to own it, not just Reeves.”
