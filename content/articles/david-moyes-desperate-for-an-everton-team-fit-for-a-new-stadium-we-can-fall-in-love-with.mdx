  in love with’

  David Moyes has described Everton’s move to Hill Dickinson Stadium as the
  start of a “new romance” but believes the strength of the marriage rests on
  the success of the team. Everton’s new £800m stadium stages its first
  competitive game on Sunday when Brighton visit in the Premier League. Moyes
  feels it was “written in the stars” that he should be in charge for the
  historic moment, but insists it is also imperative that the club construct a
  team worthy of the impressive arena. “[It is] a new romance. We’ve got a new
  stadium that we can fall in love with,” he said. “A long marriage has a lot to
  do with how the team is and what team we put on the pitch over the years to
  come. Can we make that marriage last with the supporters and everybody at the
  club? I think that’s the next bit. “We’ve built a brilliant stadium, now the
  job is to try and build a brilliant team and get to a point where we’re more
  competitive than what we are. I’m quite confident we can do that. It’s a
  difficult window and it might be a difficult year for us as well but we’ll get
  the building blocks down and hopefully we can start moving things along.”
  Moyes saw two stadium projects fail during his first spell as Everton manager,
  at Kings Dock and Kirkby, before returning in time for the move from Goodison
  Park to Liverpool’s waterfront. He said it would feel fitting to lead Everton
  into their first league game at Hill Dickinson Stadium. “To be at any one club
  for 11 and a half years in the first period takes some doing in any level of
  football,” he said. “I’ve had a great affiliation with Everton over the years
  and I’m very fortunate to be back, and it just happens I’m back in time for
  the new stadium. It could have easily been other great managers who’ve managed
  this club. But I feel that maybe it was written in the stars in some way that
  I would get the opportunity to do so.” Everton are close to a deal for Tyler
  Dibling following a breakthrough in their protracted negotiations for the
  19-year-old Southampton winger. Southampton informed Everton they wanted £45m
  plus a 20% sell-on fee for the England under-21 international when rejecting
  the Merseyside club’s third offer for the player, which was worth up to £40m.
  But three weeks on, with Everton refusing to meet Southampton’s valuation, the
  south coast club instigated fresh talks and indicated they would be willing to
  accept a lower fee. Talks are now advancing over the transfer of Dibling, with
  Everton expected to pay just over £40m including add-ons. The teenager has two
  years remaining on his contract at St Mary’s Stadium and has made it clear he
  wants a move to Hill Dickinson Stadium. Moyes has been desperate to strengthen
  his right flank all summer. The breakthrough for Dibling came after Moyes’
  press conference on Friday when he spoke of Everton potentially having to
  lower their sights in the transfer market having missed out on a number of top
  targets. Dibling has been a leading target all summer and would be the second
  most expensive signing in Everton’s history should the deal get over the line.
