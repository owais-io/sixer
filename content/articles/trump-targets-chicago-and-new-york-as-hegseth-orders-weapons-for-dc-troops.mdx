  Donald Trump has threatened to take his federal crackdown on crime and city
  cleanliness to New York and Chicago, as the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
  ordered that national guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington DC
  under federal control will now be armed. The US president talked to reporters
  in the Oval Office and said: “When ready, we will start in Chicago … Chicago
  is a mess.” He added that then the administration “will help with New York”,
  amid the controversial and aggressive federal efforts to control leading
  Democratic-voting cities, each of which has a Black mayor. On the issue of
  suddenly announcing that it would now arm the federalized troops in DC, the
  defense department did not immediately offer any other details about the new
  development or why it was needed. The step is an escalation in the federal
  government’s rare intervention into policing in the nation’s capital and came
  as nearly 2,000 national guard members are stationed in the city. Earlier this
  week hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states arrived to bolster
  the DC national guard. The Pentagon and the US army had said last week that
  troops would not carry weapons. The city had been informed about the intent
  for the national guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations
  said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans
  and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A defense official told CNN: “At the
  direction of the secretary of defense, [Joint Task Force] JTF-DC members
  supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our nation’s capital will
  soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their
  mission and training.” Trump took command of the Washington DC police
  department earlier this month and deployed the national guard, under laws and
  constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the
  nation’s capital than other cities. The US president claims that crime and
  homelessness in the district constitute a crisis, against the objections of
  local leaders. Elsewhere, the national guard is under the jurisdiction of the
  relevant state, where the state governor is the force’s commander-in-chief and
  can deploy that military in case of emergency. In rare circumstances the
  federal government takes control of a state’s national guard in what is deemed
  a national emergency, typically at the request of the state governor in
  question. Earlier this summer, Trump federalized the California national guard
  over the objection of the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, in an almost
  unprecedented abnormality, sending troops into parts of Los Angeles to counter
  protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Hegseth’s orders
  come just a day after Jeanine Pirro, the District of Columbia’s top federal
  prosecutor, instructed prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible
  in cases stemming from recent arrests, limiting their discretion as the Trump
  administration intensifies its law enforcement presence in the capital. That
  directive, first reported by the New York Times, was issued this week and
  narrows the ability of line prosecutors to decide how cases are charged and
  prioritized. By pushing for the maximum charges allowed, the new policy could
  lead to longer prison terms for convicted defendants. “In line with President
  Trump’s directive to make DC safe, US attorney Pirro has made it clear that
  the old way of doing things is unacceptable,” spokesman Tim Lauer told the
  newspaper. “She directed her staff to charge the highest crime that is
  supported by the law and the evidence.” Pirro, who was formerly a Fox News
  host, has been a prominent figure in the administration’s law-enforcement
  push. She has also pressed for changes to local laws that she argues treat
  juvenile offenders too leniently. The DC attorney’s office holds a unique
  position, overseeing federal and local prosecutions since the District of
  Columbia is not a state. The office has long debated how to handle lower-level
  arrests made by the city’s police department. According to the White House,
  federal agents have made more than 630 arrests as of Thursday, though the
  justice department has not clarified how that figure compares with typical
  city police numbers. While Pirro has committed to filing the toughest charges
  possible in most cases, she has also relaxed enforcement of one local gun law.
  This week she directed prosecutors not to pursue felony charges against people
  for possessing rifles or shotguns in the city, despite a DC law prohibiting
  them. The policy does not apply to cases involving violent crimes or
  individuals barred from owning firearms, Pirro said in a statement to CNN. She
  said that the change follows guidance from the US supreme court and the
  justice department’s solicitor general. On Thursday, Trump declared his
  takeover of the Metropolitan police department to be a success. He had
  previously signaled that he would target other cities, such as Baltimore,
  Oakland and another mission in Los Angeles, as well as New York and Chicago,
  which are all strongly Democratic-voting and run by Black mayors. The Maryland
  governor, Wes Moore, said to CNN that crime was dropping in Baltimore as a
  result of community violence prevention efforts and he would never activate
  the national guard “for theatrics”. Baltimore’s mayor, Brandon Scott, also
  spoke to CNN, accusing Trump of “singling out Black cities” and Moore said
  that the cities the president was now targeting “are places he has never been,
  streets he has never walked”.
