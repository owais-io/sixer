  India’s supreme court has ordered the immediate removal of thousands of stray
  dogs from the Delhi capital region, citing canine attacks and the country’s
  alarming rabies toll. The sweeping move has set up a clash between public
  safety advocates and those who see the animals as beloved fixtures of their
  neighbourhoods. The ruling on Monday, one of the strongest in the nation’s
  long-running struggle with its street dog population, directs civic
  authorities to capture all strays, sterilise and vaccinate them and relocate
  them to newly built shelters. The court gave authorities eight weeks to create
  the facilities and install CCTV monitoring to ensure no animals are released
  back on to the streets. The bench stressed the need for immediate action.
  “Round up all stray dogs from all localities … whether sterilised or
  unsterilised,” Justice JB Pardiwala declared. “Children must feel safe while
  cycling and playing. The elderly must feel safe on their walks.” Stray dog
  control has become a lightning rod civic issue in Delhi and other Indian
  cities. While some residents see the dogs as a menace, others consider them to
  be like family. Many of the dogs are fed daily by “community feeders” who
  provide food, water and veterinary care. Nishima Bhagat, who attended a
  candlelight march in the centre of the city on Monday night to protest against
  the court ruling, said: “We are walking in solidarity to show that there are
  people for the voiceless. They [the dogs] cannot speak for themselves. They
  cannot be put into the pounds. We cannot uproot them from the place where they
  live.” India bears the highest rabies burden globally. Each year about 5,700
  people die from rabies, according to government figures, and the World Health
  Organization believes the toll to be as high as 20,000 deaths. The last dog
  census, in 2012, put Delhi’s stray population at 60,000 and the figure now is
  estimated to be closer to 1 million. Dog packs roam parks, construction sites
  and residential lanes. Attacks on children and elderly people often make news
  headlines. Between January and June this year, Delhi reported 35,198 animal
  bite incidents and 49 rabies cases, municipal data shows. Pardiwala dismissed
  India’s animal birth control (ABC) rules, which mandate that sterilised dogs
  be returned to their territories, as “absurd” and ineffective. “All these
  so-called animal lovers, will they bring back the children who have lost their
  lives?” he said, urging civic authorities to act decisively rather than debate
  policy. The ruling said there could be no exceptions and that anyone resisting
  the removals would face charges. Animal protection groups called the order
  “impractical and inhumane”. Bharati Ramachandran, the chief executive of the
  Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations, urged large-scale
  sterilisation, vaccination, and public awareness campaigns. Mini Aravindan, a
  senior official at Peta India, said: “It’s infeasible to build and staff
  enough shelters for hundreds of thousands of dogs” and the cost would be huge.
