  Support lines. Slogans. Culture reviews. Even a new standards body. The
  pipeline of toxic behaviour haunting Britain’s television industry in recent
  years has led to numerous attempts to end the grim assumption among its
  workers that little can be done to challenge the inappropriate actions of
  powerful figures. Recent initiatives have shown signs of reducing bad
  behaviour. However, in an industry that still talks about “above the line”
  talent – referring to the leading creative figures and cast in a show – many
  working in the production world fear it still suffers from a power imbalance
  that fosters unacceptable treatment and deters whistleblowing. “We’re an
  industry that’s supposed to be progressive and groundbreaking, but has
  embedded itself in some of the worst habits of Hollywood,” said one
  experienced, female executive producer. “For the amount of money and profile
  it generates for the country, it is a very badly safeguarded industry.” The
  high-profile cases, including allegations against Noel Clarke and Gregg
  Wallace, have spurred action, most notably with the BBC’s culture review
  published earlier this year and the industry’s creation of an independent
  standards body. The Guardian has successfully defended a libel action brought
  by Clarke over its investigation revealing claims of sexual misconduct by more
  than 20 women. A report on Wallace’s behaviour substantiated 45 allegations
  made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one
  incident of unwelcome physical contact. Big independent production companies
  and broadcasters have embraced support hotlines and some now have independent
  whistleblowing services available during shoots. Yet it is a mark of the
  problem the industry faces that while such initiatives appear to have helped
  cut the proportion of industry workers who say they have been subjected to
  bullying, harassment or discrimination over the past 12 months, the figure
  still stood at 41% last year, according to the Film and TV Charity. New data
  from the broadcasting union Bectu has found 74% of those it surveyed said
  behaviour that would be unacceptable elsewhere is tolerated in TV. What really
  worries senior industry figures is that among those who had experienced toxic
  behaviour, more than half did not report it. “What you invariably find with
  high-profile cases is that there’ll be one or two people that journalists pick
  up on, which opens the floodgates,” said Marcus Ryder, the chief executive of
  the Film and TV Charity. “What that tells me is that there is a pent-up level
  of abuse, which is just not being heard or addressed. “We’re not finding it’s
  about one rogue bad apple, or power going to the head of one celebrity or one
  presenter. This is an industry that has got a systemic problem, which it needs
  to address. The good news is that it does look like it’s addressing it,
  because the numbers are going down. But the bar was so high to start off
  with.” Many blame the structure of the industry, which is populated by
  powerful executives and on-screen personalities alongside freelance workers
  with precarious job security, exacerbated by the retraction in production.
  “Freelancers really still do find it difficult to report inappropriate
  behaviour,” said one female producer. “You may be able to report it more
  easily. Unfortunately, because the industry is in crisis with award-winning
  people not getting jobs, to be associated with anything that might rock the
  boat makes it difficult. Sticking out of the pack is not seen as a good
  thing.” At the Edinburgh TV festival this week, Kate Phillips, the BBC’s chief
  content officer and perhaps the most important commissioner in British
  television, was among those to make clear that no one’s inappropriate
  behaviour should be tolerated, whatever their position. The BBC has also
  launched its Call It Out campaign, designed to highlight attempts to improve
  its culture. Branded mugs, lanyards and pin badges bearing the slogan are
  already circulating around its offices across the UK. The sector has also
  backed the new Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority (CIISA),
  developed as the sector’s main antidote to the problem after the allegations
  against Clarke. The sentiment is sincere, but industry workers remain
  doubtful. “The problem now is that people are so petrified about the lack of
  job security, they’re just so unlikely ever to call somebody out –
  particularly with an artist, because the artist might say ‘it’s them or me’,”
  said Jonathan Glazier, a television consultant and experienced executive
  producer. “The large, global [production companies] might take a view that
  nobody’s bigger than the show. But I think when you get to the sort of indies
  who are producing mid-range entertainment and have two or three commissions a
  year, to jeopardise that by ejecting an artist through inappropriate behaviour
  is pretty difficult.” Some freelance workers said when they had reported
  inappropriate incidents, nothing had happened. Several emphasised the
  importance of an independent reporting system. That could come in the form of
  CIISA. However, some worry about the level of financial commitment to the body
  from some broadcasters. It relies on funding from the industry and its biggest
  players. It also has to cover a vast swathe of the creative industry, from
  television to music – and will have to carry out its work without any legal
  powers. A freelance champion promised by the government could also help keep
  up pressure on the issue, while ministers have pledged to support CIISA in its
  work. Despite some pessimism among a weary workforce, Ryder chooses to be
  optimistic that a cultural shift across the production world is possible.
  “This is a market failure,” he said. “Every sector has market failures that
  need to be addressed. We should be optimistic that this can be addressed.”
