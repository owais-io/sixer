  The National Police Chiefs’ Council and the College of Policing have backed
  plans to offer greater “transparency” on the ethnicity, and potentially the
  immigration status, of police suspects. But in a world where rumours travel
  faster than facts, this new approach will have profound consequences for
  justice – and for the people who will live with the consequences. The new
  national guidance says that “police forces should consider disclosing the
  ethnicity and nationality of suspects when they are charged in high profile
  and sensitive investigations and operations”. It comes after Reform UK accused
  police of a “cover-up” over two men who have been charged in connection with
  the alleged rape of a child in Nuneaton. Prior to this, the home secretary,
  Yvette Cooper, had expressed her view that guidance should change to allow
  “more transparency”. She was joined in this opinion by the chief inspector of
  constabulary, who warned that withholding such details could feed “two-tier
  policing” claims (the allegation that the state polices majorities more
  harshly than minorities, contrary to the overwhelming body of evidence that
  shows otherwise). The idea that identity characteristics should feature, after
  arrest, in what information is publicly released during police investigations
  has been circling for years. Until very recently, officials and criminal
  justice practitioners had mostly resisted. Their concern was simple: routine
  publication of these details would invite the public to see suspects as
  examples of a group rather than as individuals in a case. The current approach
  is embedded in force policies that explicitly root decisions over what to
  share with the media in “policing purpose” – releasing only what is necessary
  to protect life, prevent and detect crime, bring offenders to justice and
  maintain public confidence, rather than what satisfies curiosity or advances a
  political argument. It is reinforced by national professional guidance
  designed to prevent pre-trial publicity from straying into prejudice,
  including the longstanding norm that suspects should not be identified before
  they have been charged, except in clearly justified circumstances. This sits
  alongside the press regulator’s rule, established after histories of press
  stereotyping playing a role in public incitement, that race or ethnicity
  should not be mentioned in reporting unless it is “genuinely relevant to the
  story” (there is not even a public interest override to that clause).
  Together, these norms made early disclosure of ethnicity and immigration
  status the exception rather than the default. Now the explicit decision has
  been made to alter this in standard police disclosures and reporting. So, what
  has changed? The answer, simply put, is that there is a perception that the
  politics and the information environment is now different. The impact of the
  online falsehoods about the Southport killings in late July and early August
  2024 – that the attacker was an asylum seeker who had recently arrived by boat
  – ricocheted through social media and spilled into street violence. In this
  instance, the police could not initially name the suspect because he was under
  18. Subsequently, parliamentary committees, researchers and reporters have
  traced how rumour and identity claims fuelled disorder, while newsrooms and
  police forces were left firefighting conspiracy theories at speed. That crisis
  has bolstered the argument that withholding details such as nationality or
  asylum status can create a vacuum in which malign actors thrive, and that more
  routine disclosure will puncture misinformation. The problems with this
  argument are profound. First, conspiracies thrive on distortion, not on the
  careful absorption of official communications. A parliamentary committee
  concluded that social media’s business models incentivise the spread of
  misinformation, which helped trigger last summer’s violent disorder. In this
  climate, baking identity into the first telling of crime stories – before a
  suspect has been charged – is not transparency, it is kindling. Second, once
  an identity is put at the front of an update, the search for evidence gives
  way to the hunt for a “type” ahead of the facts. It steers attention from what
  happened and what can be proved to who the person is said to be and what that
  is taken to mean. In that climate, each new detail is read through the label,
  and the space for careful judgment shrinks. The history of policing and ethnic
  minorities in this country has illustrated this in numerous moral panics.
  Third, the new disclosure regime lands in a political and media environment
  that routinely associates migrants and Black and ethnic minorities with
  illegality. The Runnymede Trust’s recent analyses of millions of words in news
  articles and parliamentary debates documents how such groups are persistently
  paired with words about illegality. That pattern helps normalise hostility.
  These are not abstract academic points – they are the context in which the
  criminal justice system is brought into perpetual, manufactured culture wars
  that harm minorities and leave everyone less safe. Fourth, there’s a very
  basic problem of data quality. Police forces are famously bad at this.
  Ethnicity can be recorded as self-defined by the person involved or as
  “officer observed” using broad visual codes. Completion rates for self-defined
  data vary sharply between forces, and missing or mismatched records are
  common. National standards on ethnicity are also under review because the
  categories are contested and context-dependent. Now add the fact that
  “ethnicity”, “nationality” and “immigration status” are different things.
  Nationality may be known at the point of charging a suspect if documents are
  checked. Immigration status often is not – indeed, the police guidance
  confirms that, “It is not the role or responsibility of the police to verify a
  suspect’s immigration status” and that, “It is for the Home Office to decide
  if it is appropriate in all the circumstances to confirm immigration status.”
  Turning any such labels into front-of-house communications is an open
  invitation to error, before a correction that is too late to catch up with the
  narrative. The truth is that the demand for default disclosure of ethnicity or
  immigration status is not about transparency but advancing a political
  narrative. This is why the script scarcely needs facts to run. If police hold
  back, it is proof of concealment; if they disclose the information and those
  details fit the stereotype, this is used to indict the wider group. If the
  details do not fit, attention moves elsewhere. The new guidance might
  reconcile pressure for “transparency” with established privacy and contempt
  protections, and the ability to explain reasons for restraint (for instance,
  to safeguard a fair trial; to protect victims and witnesses; to avoid
  inflaming tensions). These too are a service to transparency as they tell the
  public that the police understand the rights of suspects and the realities of
  community safety. The real question, however, is not whether the public should
  be trusted with information. It is whether the state should normalise
  ethnicity and immigration status as the organising facts of crime reporting –
  and burden already marginalised communities with more suspicion. Nasar Meer is
