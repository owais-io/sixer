  Rail services in parts of England are cut as tracks are disturbed by lack of
  moisture

  Rail services in parts of southern England are being reduced because
  embankments have shrunk and disturbed the track after the sunniest spring in
  more than a century. Trains are unable to travel at full speed over
  embankments in Dorset and Devon that have contracted because of a lack of
  moisture in the soil. In the latest example of extreme weather affecting the
  UK’s railways, South Western Railway (SWR) said that for a safe and reliable
  service it had no alternative but to reduce the number of trains running.
  Journeys from London Waterloo to Exeter will take an hour longer, with trains
  running at 40mph instead of 85mph for sections of the route. This year’s was
  the second driest spring on record for England, with the least amount of
  rainfall since 1976. The lack of moisture has caused embankments to shrink on
  a 12-mile stretch of track between Gillingham in Dorset and Axminster in
  Devon. The speed restrictions on the single-track route means trains cannot
  pass at the usual times and places, and SWR said it had been forced to cut
  services from the schedule. The operator said dry conditions were likely to
  continue and that further speed restrictions could be needed. SWR’s chief
  operating officer, Stuart Meek, said: “We are very sorry for the disruption
  that customers will experience due to this change, as we know just how
  important the west of England line is to the communities it serves. “We have
  not taken this decision lightly … However, to continue operating a safe and
  reliable service, we have no alternative but to introduce a reduced
  timetable.” Network Rail’s operations director, Tom Desmond, said: “The safety
  of our customers is our number one priority, which is why we must impose these
  speed restrictions. We will regularly review conditions in order to restore
  the normal timetable as soon as possible.” The changing climate has caused
  problems for the railway in recent years, including the need to impose speed
  restrictions in extreme summer heat for fear of buckling rails. Train services
  were meanwhile cut back in Kent last year after the wettest winters on record
  also affected tracks and embankments. Network Rail is spending almost £3bn
  over the period 2024-29 to tackle the effects of climate change, having
  already increased its budget to maintain earthworks in the wake of the
  Stonehaven disaster, when heavy rain and poor drainage led to a landslip.
