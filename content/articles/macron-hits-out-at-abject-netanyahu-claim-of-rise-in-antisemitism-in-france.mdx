  Emmanuel Macron has hit out at Benjamin Netanyahu for his “abject” and
  “erroneous” remarks after Israel’s prime minister claimed that antisemitism
  had “surged” in France after the country’s decision to recognise a Palestinian
  state in September. In a statement released late on Tuesday, the office of the
  French president pushed back against Netanyahu’s claim. “The analysis
  suggesting that France’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine in
  September is behind the rise in antisemitic violence in France is erroneous,
  abject, and will not go unanswered,” it said. “The current period calls for
  seriousness and responsibility, not generalisation and manipulation.”
  Relations between the two leaders have been strained since July, when Macron
  announced that France would become the first major western power to recognise
  a Palestinian state at next month’s UN general assembly, in the hope of
  bringing peace to the region. At the time, Netanyahu, who is wanted by the
  international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza,
  criticised the decision, saying that France “rewards terror”. He added: “A
  Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate
  Israel – not to live in peace beside it.” The move means France will join the
  group of UN members – at least 145 out of 193 – that now recognise or plan to
  recognise a Palestinian state, according to a tally by the news agency Agence
  France-Presse. In a letter sent to Macron earlier this week, Netanyahu accused
  the French president of not doing enough to confront the alarming rise of
  antisemitism in France. “Your call for a Palestinian state pour fuels on this
  antisemitism fire,” Netanyahu wrote. A similar letter, with almost identical
  wording, was reportedly also sent to Australia’s prime minister earlier this
  week. Responding to the allegations, Macron’s office said that France
  “protects and will always protect its Jewish citizens” and that, since 2017,
  the president had systematically required the government to “take the
  strongest possible action against the perpetrators of antisemitic acts”.
  According to the latest figures from France’s interior ministry, 504
  antisemitic acts were reported across the country between January and May this
  year, suggesting a 24% decrease from the previous year. The numbers, however,
  remain high, double the number of reported incidents from the same time period
  in 2013. Members of France’s Jewish community, one of the largest in the
  world, have repeatedly warned that antisemitic acts have increased since
  Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the attack by Hamas on 7
  October 2023. Most recently, the felling of an olive tree planted in memory of
  a young French Jewish man tortured to death in 2006 prompted outrage, with
  Macron vowing to punish an act of “antisemitic hatred”. Tensions between
  Israel and its traditional allies have been mounting in recent weeks after
  Macron’s promise to recognise a Palestinian state – a move that elicited
  similar signals from Britain, Canada and Australia. This week, after sending
  Australia’s prime minister a letter accusing him of fuelling antisemitism with
  his decision to recognise a Palestinian state, Netanyahu doubled down on his
  criticism of Anthony Albanese on Tuesday, saying he was a “weak politician who
  had betrayed Israel”. Albanese brushed off the claims. “I don’t take these
  things personally,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “I treat leaders of other
  countries with respect. I engage with them in a diplomatic way.” Hours after
  his office had sparred with Netanyahu, Macron highlighted plans to co-chair a
  conference on a two-state solution with Saudi Arabia in New York in September.
  Macron made the announcement as he criticised Israel’s plans for a “military
  offensive in Gaza”, writing on social media that it “can only lead to disaster
  for both peoples and risks plunging the entire region into a cycle of
  permanent war”. Global pressure has been mounting on Israel to address the
  situation in Gaza, where at least 62,000 people have been killed and a
  complete blockade on aid entering the Palestinian territory has led to
  widespread conditions of starvation. In July, two of Israel’s most respected
  human rights organisations, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights, said
  Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, and said the
  country’s western allies had a legal and moral duty to stop it. The accusation
  echoes earlier positions taken by global human rights organisations such as
  Médecins Sans Frontières and Amnesty International. Israel denies is it
  carrying out a genocide, and says the war in Gaza is one of self-defence in
  response to the cross-border attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023, in which
  about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.
