  difficult’

  Donald Trump says he considers Sean ‘“Diddy” Combs “sort of half-innocent”
  despite his criminal conviction in federal court in July – but the president
  called pardoning the music mogul “more difficult” because of past criticism.
  Trump spoke about Combs during an interview on Friday night on the friendly
  environs of Newsmax. Combs was found guilty on 2 July of two counts of
  transportation to engage in prostitution, with each leaving him facing up to
  10 years in prison – but he was acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking and
  racketeering conspiracy charges. “He was essentially, I guess, sort of
  half-innocent,” Trump remarked to Newsmax host Rob Finnerty. “He was
  celebrating a victory, but I guess it wasn’t as good of a victory.” A number
  of media outlets reported that Trump has been weighing a pardon for Combs,
  with whom he had partied in public and exchanged mutual declarations of
  friendship before winning his two presidencies. Trump has built a track record
  of pardoning convicted political supporters in what has been widely seen as a
  broader rebuke of a justice system that found him guilty of criminally
  falsifying business records less than six months prior to his victory in the
  2024 White House election. Yet Combs evidently complicated matters for himself
  by having told the Daily Beast in 2017 that he did not “really give a fuck
  about Trump”. And in 2020, when Trump’s first presidency ended in defeat to
  Joe Biden, Combs – who is Black – told radio host Charlamagne tha God that
  “white men like Trump need to be banished”. “The number one priority is to get
  Trump out of office,” Combs said. Trump seemingly alluded to those comments in
  his interview on Friday with Newsmax when asked to revisit the concept of
  pardoning Combs. “When I ran for office, he was very hostile,” Trump said of
  the Bad Boy Records founder. “It’s hard, you know? We’re human beings. And we
  don’t like to have things cloud our judgment, right? But when you knew someone
  and you were fine, and then you run for office, and he made some terrible
  statements. “So I don’t know … It makes it more difficult to do.” Combs was
  convicted of flying people around the country, including male sex workers and
  girlfriends, for sexual encounters. He is tentatively scheduled to be
  sentenced on 3 October and has asked to be freed from custody on a $50m bond
  while awaiting that hearing. At the time of Trump’s Newsmax interview on
  Friday, Combs was being housed at New York City’s only federal lockup. Another
  federal lockup in New York City closed after the 2019 death there of disgraced
  financier, convicted sex offender and former Trump friend Jeffrey Epstein
  while awaiting federal trial. Trump’s justice department drew bipartisan
  political criticism after announcing that it would not release any more
  documents from the Epstein investigation despite earlier pledges from the
  president and his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to disclose more information
  about the case. Amid the furor, Trump has been asked about whether he is
  mulling a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been serving a 20-year prison
  sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually traffic and abuse minors.
  “Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon,” Trump has said with respect to
  Maxwell, who as of Friday had been transferred from a federal prison in
  Florida to a lower-security facility in Texas. “But right now, it would be
  inappropriate to talk about it.”
