  Labour must scrap the two-child cap on benefits to lift children out of
  poverty, the party’s former leader Neil Kinnock has urged. Rising levels of
  poverty “would make Charles Dickens furious”, Lord Kinnock said in an
  interview with the Sunday Mirror, in which he also called on ministers to
  introduce a wealth tax. The peer, who led Labour in opposition between 1983
  and 1992, is the latest senior party figure to pressure the government to end
  the two-child limit on benefits, which was introduced by the Conservatives in
  2017. The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown recently said ending the
  two-child limit, as well as the benefit cap, would be among the most effective
  ways of reducing child poverty. Lord Kinnock acknowledged the government may
  not be able to scrap the two-child cap “all at once”. He added: “But I really
  want them to move in that direction because the figures are that if that did
  occur it would mean that about 600,000 kids fewer are in poverty.” Lord
  Kinnock suggested such a move could be funded by a wealth tax on the “top 1%”,
  adding: “I know it’s the economics of Robin Hood, but I don’t think there is
  anything terribly bad about that.” He warned that over the decade and a half
  the Conservatives were in power, child poverty gradually rose. The Labour peer
  continued: “In 15 years, starting from a position where beneficial change was
  taking place, we’ve got to the place that would make Charles Dickens furious.
  “It’s been allowed to happen because the kids are voiceless and their parents
  feel powerless. I defy anybody to see a child in need and not want to help.”
  Last month, government data showed a further 37,000 children were affected by
  the two-child benefit limit in the year to April, with nearly 1.7 million now
  living in households affected by the policy. A government spokesperson said at
  the time: “Through our plan for change, we are reforming the broken social
  security system to help those who can work into good, well-paid jobs, which is
  the best way to improve living standards for families … The child poverty
  taskforce will publish an ambitious strategy later this year to ensure we
  deliver fully funded measures that tackle the structural and root causes of
  child poverty across the country.”
