  Gordon Brown has called on the UK government to issue a formal apology to
  women whose babies were forcibly adopted in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. The former
  Labour prime minister said the state should apologise for its role in the
  “terrible tragedy” of forced adoptions involving about 200,000 women in
  England and Wales. His comments come six months after campaigners said time
  was running out, with some women dying before hearing a formal apology. Karen
  Constantine of the Movement for an Adoption Apology (MAA) told the Guardian in
  February: “The value of an apology would be immensely healing and resolve
  unimaginable pain endured for decades by an ageing cohort of women who had
  their babies taken from them.” Brown said the government should acknowledge
  “the damage that was done, the hurt that it’s caused”. He told ITV News: “This
  is something that should never have happened … The fact that we can now do
  something, not to rectify the problem, but to apologise for what happened, I
  think is really important.” The Labour government had had sufficient time to
  look at the issue, he added. “It’s time to make the apology for the forced
  adoption of children, who are now adults, who have been waiting for the
  assurance that the government understands what happened to them, waiting to
  know that the government is prepared to apologise on behalf of the country.
  While it wasn’t this government’s fault, I think they are owed an apology.”
  Last year, Veronica Smith, one of the co-founders of the MAA, died aged 83.
  The loss of her daughter in a forced adoption in 1964 had “coloured the whole
  of my life”, she said. She had hoped to testify at a public hearing into
  forced adoptions, but the government dismissed calls for an inquiry in 2017.
  Discussions with senior Labour politicians before last year’s election led the
  MAA to believe that a formal apology would be issued if the party took power.
  “It’s beyond disappointing that it hasn’t happened,” said Constantine. “My
  many formal and informal conversations led me to believe an apology would be
  forthcoming and that Keir Starmer would deliver it.” Estimates of the number
  of unmarried women who were sent to mother and baby homes run by religious
  organisations and the state between 1949 and 1976 range between 180,000 and
  250,000. Most were coerced into putting their babies up for adoption; some
  babies died due to mistreatment or poor care. A parliamentary inquiry into
  forced adoptions in 2021 found the UK government was “ultimately responsible”
  for actions that inflicted harm on young, vulnerable women and children. “An
  apology by the government and an official recognition that what happened to
  these mothers was dreadful and wrong … would go some way to mitigate the pain
  and suffering of those affected,” it said. The Scottish and Welsh governments
  formally apologised for forced adoptions in 2023. In 2016, the head of the
  Catholic church in England and Wales apologised for its role in forced
  adoptions, and the Church of England also expressed “great regret”. ITV News
  said it had discovered nearly 70 unmarked graves of babies who died at
  Hopedene maternity home, a Salvation Army institution in Newcastle, through
  freedom of information requests. Last year it obtained burial records that
  revealed 197 babies were buried in mass burial grounds at least 10 different
  cemeteries across England.
