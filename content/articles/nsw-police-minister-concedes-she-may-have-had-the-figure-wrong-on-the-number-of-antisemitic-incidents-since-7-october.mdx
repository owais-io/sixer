  The New South Wales police minister has conceded she “may have had the figure
  wrong” on the number of antisemitic attacks in the state, as police data cast
  doubt on numbers used to justify controversial hate speech bills rushed
  through the state parliament this year. Speaking at a budget estimates hearing
  on Wednesday, Yasmin Catley revealed the number of offences reported under NSW
  police’s Operation Shelter was 663, of which 254 have resulted in criminal
  charges. At the same hearing the NSW police commissioner, Peter Thurtell,
  confirmed about 40% of the alleged offences had been classified as
  antisemitic, while a significant proportion had been classified as “other”.
  Separate from the hearing, the minister’s office shared a further breakdown of
  all incidents reported under Operation Shelter, which began on 11 October
  2023, two days after the Opera House protest. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  In that breakdown police advised that as of 26 March 2025, 815 incidents had
  been reported: 367 were reported as antisemitic, 38 classified as Islamophobic
  and 410 as “other”. Under Operation Shelter’s definition, “incident” also
  encompasses events that do not amount to an offence, or fall outside the
  operation’s scope. Thurtell admitted at the hearing the definition of “other”
  was imprecise and subject to an individual officer’s discretion. “It could
  have been a Nazi symbol scrawled on a toilet wall, and someone might put down
  ‘other’ as opposed to antisemitic.” Operation Shelter was set up after the
  Opera House protest with the stated goal to “ensure community safety in
  response to any future protest activity”. In February this year, after a spate
  of antisemitic attacks over the summer, the Minns government passed a suite of
  reforms aimed at curbing antisemitism. They include laws which criminalise
  people making racist remarks in public and give police broad powers to
  restrict protests near places of worship. Both offences carry a maximum
  penalty of two years in jail. It has since emerged that a protest outside a
  synagogue, described as a “catalyst” for the anti-protest laws, was targeting
  an event where a member of the Israel Defense Forces was speaking. A NSW upper
  house inquiry also will look into the relationship between parliamentary
  debates on new legislation and another incident, where a caravan was found
  laden with explosives in Dural in western Sydney. Police have since alleged it
  was not a terror event but a “con job” by organised crime. The NSW premier,
  Chris Minns, and Catley have both come under scrutiny over when they became
  aware of the police’s beliefs about the nature of the incident. Asked at a
  budget estimates hearing in March if she had misled the public about the
  threat, Catley pointed out that the state’s Jewish community had faced
  increased rates of antisemitism. “There have been more than 700 antisemitic
  events and incidents and arrests in this city,” she said at the time. On
  Wednesday, Catley said she “may have had the figure wrong”. “If I did, I
  apologise to the committee, but quite frankly, there would be so many more
  incidents than have been reported, and that I know for a fact.” Catley said
  incidents reported to the Community Security Group, an organisation that
  provides security and intelligence services to the Jewish community, were not
  recorded. Catley was also asked about Asio’s claim that there was “credible
  evidence” that Iran directed at least two of the antisemitic attacks on
  Australian soil, including one in Sydney’s east. She said the allegations did
  not diminish the impact of the attacks on the community. “I think any
  antisemitic attacks are serious. I don’t think one is more serious than the
  other,” she said. Minns declined to comment.
