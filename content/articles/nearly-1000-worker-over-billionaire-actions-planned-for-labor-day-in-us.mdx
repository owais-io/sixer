  Nearly 1,000 “worker over billionaire” protests are being planned in all 50
  states starting this weekend as part of a Labor Day week of action organized
  by labor unions and advocacy groups in opposition to the Trump
  administration’s policies. The actions include marches and rallies in cities
  such as Chicago and Los Angeles, a Labor Day parade in New York City, rallies
  in Palmer, Alaska, Freeport, Maine, and a planned protest at the state capitol
  in Honolulu, Hawaii. The protests are organized by the AFL-CIO, the largest
  federation of labor unions in the US, and dozens of partner organizations,
  including Public Citizen, Indivisible, Democracy Forward, MoveOn and Patriotic
  Millionaires. “This is about organic, grassroots organizing, and we
  intentionally wanted it to be outside of Washington DC, because that’s where
  the impacts are being felt,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, said.
  “Whether it’s teachers or nurses or construction workers, they’re all
  determined to stand up and fight back, because they’re experiencing the cuts,
  they’re experiencing the change in policies, they’re experiencing the attacks
  of this White House on their unions, and so they’re determined to make their
  voices heard and mobilize to fight forward regardless of what’s happening
  around us, no matter the obstacles.” Among the policies being protested are
  the Trump administration’s attempts to rescind collective bargaining rights
  from 1 million federal workers, the largest single act of union busting in US
  history, a cut to minimum wage requirements for federal contractors from
  $17.75 an hour to $13.30 an hour, a proposed rule to eliminate federal minimum
  wage and overtime protections for 3.7 million childcare and home care workers,
  and the rescission of a minimum wage requirement for disabled workers. The
  actions come as public support for labor unions remains strong. A national
  poll conducted by the AFL-CIO and David Binder Research found trust in labor
  unions is at 55% – larger than the 36% of respondents who said they trusted
  the Democratic party and the 35% of respondents who said they trusted the
  Republican party. “People are waking up to the fact we don’t have to just sit
  back and take it and the labor movement is the place to go to channel that
  activism, to build what’s next and we’re putting forward a vision for what the
  economy can be,” added Shuler. “When people see tanks rolling into Washington
  DC, when we were promised lower costs, they’re like, this makes no sense,”
  said Shuler. “We’re getting billionaires standing up at the front row of the
  inauguration, basically taking over agencies, our economy and our country. So
  I think that no matter what party you belong to, that is a unifying thing that
  everybody wants, the freedom, fairness and security that all working people
  deserve.” “The billionaire agenda, the corruption we’re seeing, is changing
  the way government is functioning. It’s leading to real-time and impactful
  ramifications for regular people,” said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public
  Citizen. “The gutting of Medicaid, all the firings we’ve seen of federal
  workers, the ravaging of families through Ice raids. It’s just all coming
  together to cause people to stand up and say, ‘we are the people of this
  country. It is workers over billionaires.’” Gilbert noted they currently have
  984 events scheduled, with the aim to reach over 1,000 by Labor Day, a mass
  organizing effort that has been weeks in the making. “We’ve been standing
  together over and over again to talk about the authoritarian slide that this
  administration is ushering in in our country. We expect a lot of energy this
  weekend. This is really just the beginning of an ongoing fight against what’s
  being taken away from regular people,” she said.
