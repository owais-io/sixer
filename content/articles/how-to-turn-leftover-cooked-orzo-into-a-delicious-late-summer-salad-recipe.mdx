  I rarely, if ever, buy orzo, the rice-shaped pasta, but I was intrigued by
  barbecue chef Melissa Thompson’s poll on her Instagram stories asking: “Do you
  have a half-finished bag of orzo sitting in your cupboard?” She had more than
  600 responses, almost 90% of which said yes. Thompson turned hers into a salad
  with pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to
  buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And,
  of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard. Orzo salad: an
  anti-recipe I’ve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often
  guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook
  with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use
  orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly
  cooked up to create a satiating salad. Build an imaginative meal using
  leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date – but still safe
  to eat – nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they’re off by the rancid,
  oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg
  and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or
  frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese. Serves 2 as a main or 6 as a
  side All ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to taste
  For the salad 300-400g cooked orzo (from about 125-150g uncooked) 130-260g
  cooked beans or pulses (eg ½-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney
  beans) 200-300g vegetables, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet
  potatoes, green peppers) 100-200g cheese (eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced
  or crumbled 50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds (eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts,
  pumpkin or sesame seeds) 50-100g other store cupboard ingredients (eg,
  sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas) 30-50g fresh soft herbs (eg,
  parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped Other
  leftovers, to taste – I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe
  coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix. For the dressing
  Leftover salad dressings (eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle
  on 2–4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1–2
  tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (see my apricot umeboshi recipe
  for the latter) Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build
  the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you
  can see exactly what you’ve got before mixing. Add the beans or pulses,
  followed by the cooked and raw vegetables. Add the cheese, then sprinkle over
  the nuts and seeds. Top with anything else you have in the cupboard that’s
  packed with flavour, such as sun-dried tomatoes or dried fruit. Finish with
  the chopped soft herbs, then dress to taste (if you’ve got just a little
  dressing left in the bottle, bulk it out with a splash of oil and lemon juice
  or vinegar). Mix, taste, adjust and serve.
