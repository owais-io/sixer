  Fifa has confirmed that it will employ dynamic pricing for tickets to the 2026
  World Cup from the beginning of the sales process, which starts next week. The
  system was also used for this year’s Club World Cup and, in the UK, drew
  widespread complaints from fans buying tickets for Oasis’s comeback tour. The
  use of dynamic pricing was one of a few new details Fifa officials discussed
  around ticketing for the World Cup one week before sales open, including the
  first collection of prices. The cheapest tickets will start at $60 (£44), with
  the most expensive, for a prime spot at the final, starting at $6,730
  (£5,760). Fifa did not provide any price points in between those two. Dynamic
  pricing means that those starting prices can, and probably will, rise
  significantly. This will be the first men’s World Cup to use the scheme, in
  which the ticket prices are adjusted by the seller to reflect demand – similar
  to the way surge pricing works for . Ticket companies have benefited
  significantly from dynamic pricing as its usage has risen over the last decade
  . Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation broke its record for revenue in 2024,
  with dynamic pricing thought to be a significant factor. The practice has also
  attracted complaints from fans priced out of events – including in
  high-profile cases surrounding Oasis’s tour and last season’s FA Cup final.
  Fifa officials justified the use of dynamic pricing by saying it was the
  organization’s way of adapting to the domestic market in the United States and
  Canada, where the practice is common, and where it says the public already
  accepts that event tickets will be priced according to demand. One official
  added that Fifa couldn’t pass up the additional revenue that would be
  generated by dynamic pricing, citing the 211 Fifa member nations that could
  benefit from a more profitable World Cup. According to the officials, Fifa
  never ran a baseline study to determine how much revenue could be generated
  from 2026 World Cup ticket sales without dynamic pricing – suggesting the
  topic was never really up for debate. The pricing structure is expected to be
  put into place immediately for the first phase of ticket sales, which begins
  on 10 September. Prices will fluctuate based on demand from that point on,
  meaning that some matches will have higher minimum price points than others
  before the World Cup draw has even begun. Fifa used dynamic pricing at the
  2025 Club World Cup, with mixed results. Prices for those games initially rose
  sharply, only to drop – in some cases as low as $13.40 (£10) – just before
  kickoff as stadiums remains only partially full. However, demand at the World
  Cup is almost certain to be significantly higher than at the Club World Cup,
  and a Fifa official said that this time around prices would not go lower than
  $60. Changes to ticket categories Another significant change described by Fifa
  officials comes in the way tickets are categorized for the World Cup. In past
  tournaments, Fifa has broken down seats into a category system, with Category
  1 generally considered to be the best seats, Category 2 the next best, and so
  on until Category 4. It had been standard practice for a seat’s placement in
  relation to the pitch to affect its categorization: a seat along the sideline,
  for example, was far more likely to be considered Category 1, while a seat at
  the same level but located behind the goal might be Category 2 or lower. That
  approach is no longer in use. In 2026, seat categories will in most cases
  correspond to the level of the stadium the seat is located. At the World Cup
  final, for example, the entire lower level of MetLife Stadium is expected to
  count as Category 1, with the suite level in the middle counting as Category
  2, and then the upper bowl making up Categories 3 and 4. Once again, Fifa
  officials said that the change was made to bring the organization in line with
  perceived cultural norms in the host countries. The officials said that
  according to their research, North American fans place a higher emphasis on
  proximity to the field than they do having a certain type of view of the
  match. Where and when tickets will go on sale Fifa and longtime financial
  partner Visa announced in late July the details of the first phase of ticket
  sales, and those remain largely the same. From 10-19 September, Visa
  cardholders worldwide may submit an application on Fifa’s website, and by 29
  September the randomly accepted applicants will be notified and given a date
  and time window in October, during which they can buy tickets. A Fifa official
  said that application data would be screened to prevent the influence of bots,
  and that the randomized draw would be made in the presence of a public notary
  in Zurich. As in past World Cups, fans may buy single-game tickets, or
  packages that give access to every game at a certain venue, or every game
  played by a specific team. Tickets will only be sold by category, with seats
  assigned at random within those categories until the final phase of sales, in
  which fans can buy specific seats on a first-come, first-served basis, many
  months after dynamic pricing has gone into effect. Fans can buy a maximum of
  four tickets per match, for a maximum of 10 matches during the tournament.
  Fifa said it would operate a resale marketplace in an effort to avoid
  scalping.
