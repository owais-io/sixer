  Jamie Vardy had not reached his destination, but already he was getting a
  taste of what may await him, a crowd of Cremonese supporters greeting him at
  the exit of Milan’s Linate airport – 50 miles away from their team’s home
  town. Never mind the fact it was almost midnight on a Sunday. He hopped out of
  his car to sign autographs – one over a tattoo of his own face. They sang for
  him to “take us to Europe”. Even in a summer of famous names making unexpected
  late-career moves to Italy – from Kevin De Bruyne and Napoli to Luka Modric at
  Milan – Vardy joining Cremonese feels most improbable of all. A player who
  once finished eighth in the Ballon d’Or vote, signing for a club with a
  16,000-seater stadium who have made only fleeting appearances in the top
  flight since they were founded in 1903. Promoted via the playoffs in June,
  this is Cremonese’s ninth-ever season in Serie A. Six of the previous eight
  have ended in relegation. The two exceptions came back-to-back, in 1993-94 and
  1994-95, the latter with a young Enrico Chiesa up front. Before this season,
  they were the bookies’ favourites to go down again – ahead even of fellow
  newly promoted sides Sassuolo and Pisa. They may yet, but in two games
  Cremonese have contradicted the narrative of a team hopelessly out of their
  depth. They opened with a 2-1 win over Modric and Milan at San Siro: a night
  of extraordinary firsts. This was Cremonese’s first-ever away victory against
  the Rossoneri, and the first time they had won their opening game of a Serie A
  campaign. All the previous eight ended in defeat. It was also the first time
  their manager, Davide Nicola, had beaten Massimiliano Allegri. Hired this
  summer after Cremonese declined to renew the contract of the man who got them
  promoted, Giovanni Stroppa, Nicola is reputed as Serie A’s great survival
  expert. In recent years, he has steered Crotone, Genoa, Torino, Salernitana
  and Empoli through troubled waters to 17th-place finishes. Typically, he is
  the man that owners turn to midterm, to rescue seasons gone awry. Last year,
  afforded the chance to lead Cagliari from the start, he made it to the heady
  heights of 15th. After Cremonese’s win over Milan, he spoke about the
  importance of fostering a positive environment. “Everyone’s happy to have
  given some joy to the fans tonight,” he said. “That’s so important for the
  energy it transmits.” The atmosphere was electric back at their own Stadio
  Zini as they hosted Sassuolo on Friday. Rumours of Vardy’s imminent arrival
  played their part. Before kick-off, the club’s sporting director Simone
  Giacchetta described the situation to Dazn as “one of those things that start
  out a bit as a joke, then, over time, it starts to take on form.” It helps
  when the club’s owner is a billionaire. Giovanni Arvedi bought Cremonese in
  2007, when they were still playing in the third tier. His investment has been
  essential in this climb back up the ladder. Cremonese have not spent
  recklessly – their total outlay on transfer fees this summer is less than €15m
  – but his backing will have made wage negotiations for Vardy less painful.
  Cremonese jumped out to a 2-0 lead over Sassuolo before half-time. Filippo
  Terracciano headed home from a corner, then Franco Vázquez applied a final
  touch on Antonio Sanabria’s shot across goal. But last season’s Serie B
  champions pulled back level after the interval. Andrea Pinamonti served an
  efficient turn-and-finish before Domenico Berardi converted a penalty given
  away cheaply by the substitute Alberto Grassi. The visitors looked to push for
  a winner. But Cremonese won a penalty of their own in injury time when another
  substitute, Romano Floriani Mussolini, was fouled by Alieu Fadera. Manuel De
  Luca, the player whose two goals in the playoff final against Spezia secured
  Cremonese’s promotion in June, scored from the spot before running the length
  of the pitch to celebrate under the home Curva. Mussolini’s surname will jump
  off the page for many readers. He is the great-grandson of the fascist
  dictator Benito Mussolini and the son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former member
  of the Italian and European parliaments. And yes, he plays on the right wing.
  He is also his own person, a 22-year-old who has insisted politics does not
  interest him. His desire to distance himself from that discourse may be
  reflected in the fact that he chooses to wear his first name, Romano, on his
  shirt. Nicola praised his performance on Sunday, noting with satisfaction that
  this was the fourth player in two games to whom Cremonese had given a Serie A
  debut. One of the most impressive aspects of their fast start is the number of
  players who have made telling contributions. Cremonese are playing in a 3-5-2
  under Nicola. Their front two against Milan was made up of David Okereke and
  Federico Bonazzoli – who sealed the win with a brilliant scissor-kick. Injury
  kept him out against Sassuolo, but Vázquez returned from suspension to start,
  and Sanabria was given the nod alongside. De Luca came on as a late sub in
  both games. Each of these players has different strengths, and the pecking
  order is not yet clear. Sanabria and Bonazzoli have each worked under Nicola
  at previous clubs and the latter spoke recently about how much he values their
  relationship, saying: “His importance to me goes beyond the usual
  player-manager dynamic. He has a weight in my life.” The expectation, still,
  is that Vardy will start. Despite turning 38 in January, the Englishman scored
  nine Premier League goals last season, and his directness ought to make him a
  good fit. Nicola likes his teams to play in a low block, relying on fast
  breaks and efficiency on the counterattack. Cremonese, through their first two
  games, have conformed to this type. It is early yet to draw conclusions, but
  there are encouraging signs beyond the results. Jari Vandeputte, something of
  a lower-league legend after piling up 32 goals and 66 assists in the second
  and third tiers over the past four seasons (playoffs included), ran the
  midfield and set up the opening goal against Sassuolo. Alessio Zerbin, a loan
  signing from Napoli, has impressed on the right. The most important thing, of
  course, is that they have six points on the board. Enough to move them top of
  the table on Friday night, even if other clubs have since caught up. Vardy’s
  arrival has multiplied the already abundant enthusiasm for this underdog
  story. Leicester’s 2015-16 Premier League title was widely celebrated in
  Italy, a triumph to which many fans felt connected through the figure of
  Claudio Ranieri. Patriotic pride was found in the fact that one of the
  country’s most likable exports had authored such an unlikely triumph in the
  richest league in the world. For an English symbol of that success to travel
  in the opposite direction, all these years later, has unleashed waves of happy
  nostalgia. Those fans who greeted Vardy at Linate were asking him to take them
  on a European adventure. For now, their club’s ninth-ever season of top-flight
  football is shaping up as its own fascinating caper.
