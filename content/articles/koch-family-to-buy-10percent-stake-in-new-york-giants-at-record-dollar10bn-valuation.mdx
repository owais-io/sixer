  The New York Giants have agreed to sell a minority stake to Julia Koch and her
  family in a deal that values the storied NFL franchise at more than $10bn, the
  highest valuation ever for a sports team. According to multiple reports, the
  Kochs will pay more than $1bn for a 10% interest in the team. The transaction
  is expected to be presented to the league’s other owners for approval when
  they meet in October. The deal will reshape but not upend the Giants’
  century-old ownership structure. The Mara family, who founded the club in
  1925, and the Tisch family, who bought in during 1991, will each see their
  holdings reduced from 50% to 45%. John Mara remains the team’s president and
  chief executive. The Giants had announced in February that they had retained
  the investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to explore the sale of a non-controlling
  slice of the franchise. That process has now produced the most lucrative
  minority stake sale in league history. It comes only months after a majority
  stake in the Los Angeles Lakers was sold at a $10bn valuation, until now the
  record for any sports organization. For the Kochs, the deal represents a
  further move into New York’s professional sports landscape. Last year Julia
  Koch and her three children purchased a 15% stake in BSE Global – the parent
  company of the Brooklyn Nets, WNBA’s New York Liberty and Barclays Center – in
  a deal that valued the group at $6bn. Koch, the widow of industrialist and
  political donor David Koch, is the richest woman in New York City, with a
  fortune estimated at between $74bn and $81bn depending on the source. Forbes
  and Bloomberg both place her among the 20 wealthiest people in the world. The
  Giants, four-time Super Bowl winners and one of the NFL’s most storied
  franchises, are now valued by Sportico at $10.25bn, ranking them as the
  third-most valuable team in the league. By comparison, the San Francisco 49ers
  earlier this year sold a 6.2% stake at an $8.6bn valuation. Representatives
  for both the Koch family and the Giants declined to comment on the agreement,
  which will only become final if ratified by the NFL’s ownership committee. If
  approved, it will cement a new landmark in the ongoing surge of franchise
  valuations across American sport.
