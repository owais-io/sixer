  Whether it’s poaching top talent away from competitors, acquiring AI startups
  or proclaiming that it will build data centers the size of Manhattan, Meta has
  been on a spending spree to boost its artificial intelligence capabilities for
  months now. The massive splurge is paying off, according to Meta’s chief
  executive. In a new memo posted on Wednesday ahead of the company’s quarterly
  earnings report, Mark Zuckerberg, describes his ambitions for developing what
  he calls “superintelligence”. “Over the last few months we have begun to see
  glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves,” Zuckerberg wrote. “The
  improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is
  now in sight.” Wall Street investors are happy with the expensive course
  Zuckerberg is charting. After the company reported better-than-expected
  financial results for yet another quarter, its stock soared by double digits.
  Though Zuckerberg did not provide any details of what would qualify as
  “superintelligence” versus standard artificial intelligence, he did say that
  it would pose “novel safety concerns”. “We’ll need to be rigorous about
  mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source,” he
  wrote. Zuckerberg wrote that the company differs from other AI firms in that
  Meta aims to bring “personal superintelligence to everyone”. Other companies
  are focused on primarily using “superintelligence” for productivity and to
  automate “all valuable work”, he wrote. “The rest of this decade seems likely
  to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take,
  and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a
  force focused on replacing large swaths of society,” he wrote. Investors want
  to know: does AI mean cashflow? Investors are looking for signs that the
  parent company of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook is spending its billions
  efficiently. The social media company reported its second quarter earnings on
  Wednesday after the close of the New York stock exchange and beat investor
  expectations yet again sending stocks soaring 10%. Analysts expect Meta will
  have to answer questions about whether the revenue the company is bringing in
  will help offset the hundreds of billions the firm is spending on recruiting
  and infrastructure, collectively known as capital expenditure. “AI-driven
  investments into Meta’s advertising business continue to pay off, bolstering
  its revenue as the company pours billions of dollars into AI ambitions like
  superintelligence,” said Minda Smiley, a senior analyst at Emarketer. “But
  Meta’s exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions
  and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns.” Meta reported $7.14
  in earnings per share (EPS) on $47.52bn in revenue, surpassing Wall Street
  expectations of $5.92 in earnings per share on $44.8bn in revenue. This
  quarter is the latest in the company’s multiple-quarter streak of exceeding
  Wall Street’s financial expectations despite enormous spending on AI. The
  company also said it expects to bring in $47.5bn to $50.5bn in revenue in the
  third quarter of 2025. Zuckerberg provided few tangible updates in the memo,
  but one thing is clear: getting to this so-called higher level of intelligence
  will require a great deal of capital. Meta reported that the total costs and
  expenditures for the second quarter of 2025 came in at $27.07bn – up 12% year
  over year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.01bn. The company
  also provided updated guidance on how much the firm expects to spend in the
  next few months. Meta said it expected to spend between $114bn and $118bn in
  total expenses in 2025 – a slight adjustment from its previous projection of
  between $113bn and $118bn. Of that, Meta said it expected its capital
  expenditures to amount to somewhere in the range of $66bn and $72bn. The
  company previously predicted it would spend between $64bn and $72bn which was
  increased from an even earlier prediction of $60bn to $65bn. Meta is still in
  the process of planning for 2026, but said that it expected total expenses in
  the next year to increase beyond 2025 spending. “The largest single driver of
  growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in
  depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale
  up our infrastructure fleet,” the company said in a press release. “Aside from
  infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee
  compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full
  year of compensation expenses for employees hired throughout 2025.” The
  company has been building out its new superintelligence labs team with talent
  from competing AI firms. Meta first invested $14.3bn into Scale AI in exchange
  for a 49% stake in the company, and brought the startup’s CEO, Alexandr Wang,
  on as chief AI officer. Since then, several reports indicate Meta is
  attracting engineers and other employees away from firms like Apple, Github
  and several startups with huge compensation packages – including at least one
  that came in over $200m, according to Bloomberg. “To win the superintelligence
  race requires the best of the best talent and Meta has been on a roll when it
  comes to recruiting top AI talent,” said Forrester’s research director, Mike
  Proulx. “Money talks and Meta has plenty of it – reaching into the company’s
  deep pockets to lure luminaries from its competition with lavish compensation
  packages, while spending hundreds of billions on datacenters to power and
  scale its AI initiatives.” While Reality Labs continues to be a small
  contributor to revenue, bringing in $370m in the second quarter, Zuckerberg
  remains bullish on the utility and longevity of its AI glasses. He compared
  wearing AI glasses with wearing contact lenses in that he would be at a
  cognitive disadvantage without them. “I personally think that if you don’t
  have glasses that have AI you will be at a cognitive disadvantage,” he said.
  “It is kind of what we have been maxing out with Reality Labs.” Advertising
  revenue, the company’s primary source of revenue, continues to grow. Meta
  brought in $46.6bn in advertising revenue in the second quarter, up from
  $38.3bn for the same quarter in 2024. Meta chief financial officer, Susan Li,
  said on the investor call that the company does not expect WhatsApp, one of
  its newer sources of advertising, to be a “meaningful contributor” to overall
  growth of ad revenue for the next few years. “We also expect WhatsApp ads and
  status to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the
  foreseeable future, due in part to WhatsApp’s skew toward lower monetizing
  markets and more limited information that can be used for targeting,” Li said.
