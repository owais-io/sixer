  Against the scale of civilian slaughter, famine and mounting evidence of war
  crimes in Gaza, Europe’s political leaders have been passive to the point of
  complicity, argue many human rights advocates and even former high-ranking EU
  officials. Now the Spanish prime minister has come close to acknowledging as
  much. In an interview with the Guardian, Pedro Sánchez characterised Europe’s
  refusal to act against the Israeli government as a moral and political failure
  that would damage its global credibility for years to come. Sánchez warned
  that Europe’s response to “one of the darkest episodes of the 21st century”
  has been “a failure, absolutely”. Sánchez became the first senior EU leader to
  accuse Israel of genocide in July – other governments, including the UK, argue
  that only international courts can make such a judgment. In today’s interview,
  Sánchez admitted Europe is operating double standards in how it responds to
  Ukraine and Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory. The comments
  reflect increasing impatience in Madrid with the deep divisions that have so
  far resulted in the EU’s near-paralysis on Gaza – and a sense among many
  voters that all EU governments are ignoring the political decisions that have
  led to this humanitarian catastrophe. Spain’s leader wants the suspension of
  the strategic partnership the EU has with Israel and said that Spain would
  push Europe to do more, including punishing Israel financially. The EU
  certainly has strong economic levers it could pull, being Israel’s biggest
  trading partner. An internal review in July could have triggered a suspension
  of some of the trade concessions Israel enjoys under its “association
  agreement” with the EU. But Israel’s closest EU allies – Germany, Hungary and
  the Czech Republic – oppose sanctions. The growing public pressure potentially
  strengthens Spain’s hand in the EU debate, although as the Patrick Wintour
  points out, in his analysis, Sánchez is limited to trying to persuade more EU
  states until there is a majority for suspension. In the meantime, a flotilla
  set off from Barcelona on Sunday, carrying activists including Greta Thunberg,
  seeking, organisers say, to non-violently “break the illegal siege of Gaza”
  and deliver food and supplies to starving Palestinians. More governments are
  also taking symbolic steps. On Tuesday, Belgium added itself to the list of
  countries that have or will soon recognise Palestinian sovereignty. France and
  the UK will follow suit this month. And in Ireland, campaigners claimed
  victory on Monday after Israel moved approval for the issuance of its war
  bonds – which raise cash on international markets for its campaign in Gaza –
  from the Irish central bank to Luxembourg. But, argued Irish author Naoise
  Dolan writing about her decision to join the flotilla, even European
  governments that vaunt their solidarity with Palestinians “aid and abet”
  Israel’s war in other ways. She highlighted the impact that video images such
  as those of a person being beaten up by German police at a Gaza protest in
  Berlin last week would have on public opinion. In Sánchez’s interview, the
  socialist prime minister also “showed a willingness to frame a values-based
  foreign policy”, wrote Patrick Wintour, criticising Donald Trump for the
  “shocking reality” that the US is now dismantling the rules-based
  international order it helped to create from the ruins of the second world
  war. *** Russia’s ‘undeniable interference’ It could be the stuff of a cold
  war spy novel: the presiding head of Europe’s core political community is
  touring the bloc’s eastern borders when the radar system of her aircraft is
  jammed in Bulgarian airspace. The mysterious attack shuts down the plane’s GPS
  navigation system, forcing the pilots to rely on paper maps to land. But this
  is not fiction: it happened to Ursula von der Leyen last Sunday. The jet
  carrying the president of the EU commission from Warsaw to Plovdiv in Bulgaria
  landed safely after what may have been a tense hour in the cockpit. But the
  incident has heightened fears that as war rages in Ukraine, Russia is stepping
  up a campaign of hybrid warfare against its European allies. The Kremlin
  denied involvement, telling the Financial Times, which broke the story, its
  information was “incorrect”. EU officials said the disruption was “undeniable
  interference” and is being investigated as a suspected Russian sabotage
  operation. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said Nato is “working day and
  night to counter this, to prevent this.” Incidents of GPS jamming and
  “spoofing”, an electronic warfare tactic that causes incorrect navigation
  information to be displayed, have increased since 2022, and escalated even
  more sharply in the past year, particularly in the Baltic states. Even if
  destabilising the EU’s frontline states is very much on Putin’s radar, why
  would von der Leyen be a target? The commission chief has pursued a far more
  geopolitical agenda than her predecessors and is a robust critic of Putin.
  Hours before the aircraft incident, on the border between Poland and Belarus,
  she called the Russian president a “predator”, following missile strikes on
  Kyiv that killed at least 23 people and damaged EU offices. Under her
  stewardship the EU has also become more militarised: her four-day tour was
  about visiting weapons factories and discussing how to build the EU’s defence
  infrastructure to be able to confront Russia. This latest incident is further
  evidence, as many in Kyiv including Olga Chyzh argue, that Russia is
  uninterested in peace. It also shows that Putin’s war on Ukraine doesn’t stop
  at Ukraine’s borders. To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in
