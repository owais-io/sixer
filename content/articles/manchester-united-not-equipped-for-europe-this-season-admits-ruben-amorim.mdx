  Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United’s squad would not have been equipped
  to play European football this season. A slow start to the Premier League has
  yielded one point from two matches as United turn attention to Wednesday’s
  Carabao Cup tie at League Two Grimsby, where Amorim has promised to shuffle
  the pack. United, having lost last season’s Europa League final and finished
  15th in the Premier League, are not one of the nine English clubs playing
  European football. Amorim said that could be to his team’s long-term benefit.
  “I think we were not prepared to play Europe,” he said. “That is my feeling;
  to have strong games in the Champions League and to play Premier League we
  need time to develop as a team. “I said last season we need time to prepare
  for every game. The games are really competitive and we need to build to our
  base and then to perform. And then in the future we need to have Europe for
  everyone to play games.” Signalling his intention to make changes at Grimsby,
  Amorim said: “We have three games this week, we have quality players and we
  have to rotate to try to win every game.” In the league for United, Burnley’s
  visit this Saturday follows Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Fulham and the opening home
  defeat by Arsenal. Several United players have been linked with an exit,
  including the striker Rasmus Højlund. Amorim, asked whether a player linked
  with a return to Serie A would play at Grimsby, said: “All the players are
  available, and you make the choice to get the best starting XI to win every
  game.” Højlund was not on the bench at Craven Cottage. Jadon Sancho, Tyrell
  Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are, meanwhile, in the group that the
  club, on Amorim’s instruction, must speed to the exit in the closing days of
  the transfer window. Amorim said of players such as Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet
  to play a minute this season but was on the bench at Fulham: “They just need
  to fight for the places and then everything can change. Sometimes one is
  playing and at other moments other guys are going to play, so we have the
  cups; we are going to have a lot of chances for everybody.”
