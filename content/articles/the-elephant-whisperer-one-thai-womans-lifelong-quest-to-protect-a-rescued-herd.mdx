  Saengduean Lek Chailert was five years old when she saw an elephant for the
  first time. It was in chains, lumbering past her home in rural Thailand on its
  way to help loggers pull trees from the forest. Back then, she saw the giant
  mammals like everyone else – as animals that served humans. But that changed
  the day she heard a scream from the forest. Chailert was 16 when she heard the
  terrible noise. She scrambled through the trees until she found the source: a
  bull elephant scrabbling in the mud as it tried and failed to drag a log out
  of a ditch. Every failed attempt was met with punishment from the loggers and
  mahout, the elephant keeper. One would fire a sling shot at the animal,
  another stabbed it with a knife and a third jabbed a spike into the elephant’s
  leg. With each jab, the animal would let out a scream of pain. “The elephant
  looked at me and I felt the fear and anger. I felt helpless and confused. My
  heart hurt a lot,” says Chailert. “I tried everything to get the screaming to
  stop but I was disturbing their work, so I had to go. I kept asking ‘why, why,
  why?’ “When I went back to my village, I could still hear the elephant when we
  were having dinner that night,” she says. The incident changed the direction
  of Chailert’s life for ever. She was from a poor family – there was no
  electricity or school in her village – but she vowed to do something for the
  animals she loved. Before a ban on logging in natural forests in Thailand in
  1989, elephants were a key part of the industry. In the early 20th century,
  there were an estimated 100,000 elephants in Thailand. Thousands were worked
  to death or left with severe injuries from dragging enormous trees from the
  rainforest to roads, where they would be transported for lumber. After the
  ban, many elephants were used by the country’s rapidly growing tourism
  industry to give performances and rides. Working in a tourism agency in her
  early 20s, Chailert watched the change happen with horror. “There were many
  backpackers at that time. Camp owners were competing with each other for
  tourists,” she says. “They would train their elephants to dance, ride a
  motorbike, play darts or hula hoop, walk on a rope or play a harmonica. This
  brought more suffering to elephants.” It took Chailert a few attempts to
  fulfil her dream of finding a way to care for Thailand’s elephants. In 1996,
  she sold everything she had and borrowed money to set up an elephant
  sanctuary. She paid $30,000 for four hectares (10 acres) of land to provide a
  home to nine elephants. She insisted that there would be no elephant rides or
  performances. Her family invested money to help but after disagreements over
  how to run the park, she left the project, taking the elephants with her.
  Then, Chailert got lucky. National Geographic was filming a documentary with
  the Hollywood star Meg Ryan about Thailand’s wild elephants, which were
  estimated to number 4,000 to 4,400 by 2023; Chailert and her newly released
  elephants featured in it. In the US, a Texas couple, Bert and Christine Von
  Roemer, saw the TV programme and contacted Chailert, donating enough money to
  buy a 20-hectare parcel of land in the Mae Taeng district of northern
  Thailand, near Chiang Mai. In 2003, Elephant Nature Park was born. Today,
  about 120 rescue elephants are at the park, which has grown to more than 1,000
  hectares, home to a small fraction of the 3,900 or so domesticated elephants
  in the country. The sanctuary’s work has an enormous social media following on
  Instagram and Facebook. Elephants arrive from all over Thailand. Chailert, now
  64, sometimes travels for more than 50 hours with the animals after they are
  rescued. “Some arrive with huge mental issues. Some stand like a zombie; some
  are aggressive, they swing their head back and forth. When they arrive, we do
  not allow our staff to use any tools or do anything that might make them feel
  threatened. “We are gentle. We have to give them our love to make them trust
  us. We have to be patient,” she says. New arrivals are almost always put into
  quarantine and slowly introduced to the herd. Over time, they are accepted.
  When their ears start to flap and their tails start to whirl, the elephants
  are happy, says Chailert. “The priority is that every elephant has a family,”
  she says, showing the herd feeding in the forest on a screen. Today, the
  conservation scheme is funded by visitors and volunteers who pay to work on
  the project. But despite the success of the sanctuary, Chailert fears for the
  future of Asian elephants, which she believes are decreasing in Thailand,
  despite official figures showing a steady increase in the population.
  “Throughout Asia, many people are starting to hate elephants. Human-wildlife
  conflict is a big problem. Many died from being shot and poisoned” she says.
  “Many have lost their habitat and water sources so they have to go to golf
  clubs and rice fields – places that don’t belong to them. So, people get angry
  and make the elephant into a monster. The future will depend on the government
  policy to resolve this,” she says.
