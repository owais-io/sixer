  The head of the UK’s air traffic control company is facing calls to resign
  after the second disruption to flights in two years due to technical problems.
  Hundreds of flights were delayed after the air traffic control (ATC) system
  went down for about 20 minutes on Wednesday. Nats, the company that runs the
  system, blamed a technical problem and said it had now been resolved. The
  problems raised fears of a repeat of chaos at airports in August 2023 when
  hundreds of thousands of passengers’ flights were delayed or cancelled.
  British Airways said it was forced to restrict the number of its inbound and
  outbound flights at Heathrow to 32 an hour until 7.15pm. It said the flow rate
  would then return to the usual level of 45 an hour. It is understood that the
  UK National Cyber Security Centre does not view it as a hacking incident.
  Ryanair called for the Nats chief executive, Martin Rolfe, to resign or be
  fired. The airline’s chief operating officer, Neal McMahon, said: “It is
  outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption
  due to Martin Rolfe’s continued mismanagement of Nats. “Yet another ATC system
  failure has resulted in the closure of UK airspace meaning thousands of
  passengers’ travel plans have been disrupted. It is clear that no lessons have
  been learned since the August 2023 Nats system outage, and passengers continue
  to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe’s incompetence.” He said if Rolfe failed
  to resign then the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, “must act without
  delay to remove Martin Rolfe and deliver urgent reform of Nats’ shambolic ATC
  service, so that airlines and passengers are no longer forced to endure these
  preventable delays caused by persistent Nats failures”. At about 5pm Nats said
  its engineers had “restored the system that was affected” and it was “in the
  process of resuming normal operations”. The technical issue affected flights
  across the UK as the number of aircraft that could fly in England and Wales
  was restricted, the company said. The problem left many aircraft and flight
  crew out of position. Airports advised passengers to check with airlines for
  updates. Liverpool’s John Lennon airport said that Wednesday’s remaining
  flights could face delays. Several flights scheduled to arrive at UK airports
  were required to fly in holding patterns or divert elsewhere. Nats said the
  technical issue was at its control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire. Alexander
  said: “I am aware of a technical issue which impacted Nats’ operations causing
  travel disruption this afternoon. I have been informed systems have now been
  restored but continued disruption is expected, and passengers should check
  with individual airports for advice.” More than 700,000 passengers suffered
  disruption when flights were grounded at UK airports on 28 August 2023 after
  Nats experienced a technical glitch while processing a flight plan. A
  Department for Transport spokesperson said: “While passengers should continue
  to check with individual airports for advice, Nats have confirmed their
  systems are now fully operational and flights are returning to normal. “We are
  working closely with Nats to understand the cause of the technical issue and
  the implications for the resilience systems in place.” The department noted
  Alexander does not have any direct control over Nats and has no powers on
  staffing decisions.
