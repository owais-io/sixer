  Socially, you know it is going to be awkward. Tom has travelled miles for the
  funeral of his boyfriend who has died much too young. Deep in the countryside,
  Ágatha, the bereaved mother, has never heard of Tom and knows nothing of her
  son’s sexuality. Tom wants to grieve but, out of respect, cannot give voice to
  his true emotions – not least because the dead man’s brutish brother, Francis,
  is determined to keep Ágatha in untroubled ignorance. The social awkwardness
  is part of Michel Marc Bouchard’s play, first seen in Montreal in 2011 and
  later adapted for the screen. What director Rodrigo Portella adds to this
  spellbinding production for Cena Brasil Internacional is a fierce physical
  awkwardness. It is in the way the actors stand isolated on the desolate stage,
  designed by Aurora dos Campos in rusty browns that seem to extend for ever.
  The figures are picked out in lonely relief by Tomás Ribas’s punishing
  lightning, lost souls on a collision course. It is in the way the stage is
  puddled with farmyard mud, clinging to the actors and making their discomfort
  palpable. And it is in the menace of Francis (Iano Salomão), an
  unreconstructed symbol of macho intolerance. He bears down mercilessly on the
  urbane Tom, played with grace and some resistance by Armando Babaioff who, as
  translator, relocates the script to Bolsonaro’s Brazil, the country reported
  to have the world’s highest rate of violent deaths of LGBTQ+ people. Coupled
  with the stately pace of a broody, intense production, it makes this farm not
  just a reactionary backwater, but a cultural dead end. It is a place where any
  possibility of progress is extinguished like the sickly cattle Francis throws
  into a ditch. The play becomes not just about the death of a son but about the
  death of hope. Even if Ágatha (Denise Del Vecchio) is not as clueless as
  Francis makes out and even if Tom becomes paralysed by Stockholm syndrome,
  this awful scenario can surely not persist. Arriving from the city, Sara
  (Camila Nhary) throws brief light on a self-destructive culture eating itself
  from within. It is as cruel as it is mesmerising. At the Pleasance at EICC,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
