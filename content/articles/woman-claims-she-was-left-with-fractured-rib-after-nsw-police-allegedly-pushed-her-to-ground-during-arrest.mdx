  NSW police are investigating an arrest in which an officer allegedly pushed a
  woman to the ground outside a school, an incident she says left her with a
  fractured rib, severe concussion and a cut to her ear. The police force
  confirmed in a statement that it was investigating an incident at Bungendore,
  in the state’s south, on 22 July, after footage circulated online. A 35-second
  video appears to show a woman with her back to the camera shouting at another
  woman, while a third stands between the pair. An officer approaches from
  behind and appears to shove her to the side, causing her to fall to the
  ground, where she appears to strike her head against a pole. He can be heard
  shouting “keep the fuck away” as he appears to push the woman. The officer
  then arrests her. The woman, who is Aboriginal, claimed in a social media post
  sharing the footage: “I got knocked out! I suffered a severe concussion, I had
  to have my ear glued because of the cut I sustained and I also suffered a
  fractured rib from this assault.” She declined to comment further. Her lawyer
  in the criminal matter, the Aboriginal Legal Service, has been contacted for
  comment. The Guardian understands the woman intends to pursue a civil claim
  against police at the conclusion of the criminal case. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email A solicitor advising her on the civil claim, Michael Lalor,
  declined to comment, other than to say: “if police are reflective of the
  society that they serve, the actions of police need to be judged against the
  values of that society”. NSW police said in a statement that officers from the
  Monaro police district were called to a school on Majara Street, Bungendore,
  about 2.50pm on 22 July after reports a 15-year-old boy was allegedly
  threatened. Police said that while officers were inside a building, a woman
  drove past the school when another 15-year-old boy allegedly threw a rock at
  her vehicle, causing the right passenger window to shatter. “The woman stopped
  and got out of the vehicle, when she was threatened and chased by the boy and
  a 32-year-old woman known to the boy,” NSW police alleged. “The officer and
  members of the public intervened and the boy was arrested. The woman, who
  police said was known to the boy, allegedly became aggressive towards police
  and attempted to physically intervene. “Police warned the woman on a number of
  occasions, and while the boy was placed into the police vehicle, the woman
  allegedly threatened the other woman again.” Police said a senior constable
  then “returned to the scene, arresting the 32-year-old woman”. They made no
  comment about the footage of the arrest, other than they were “reviewing
  footage circulating on social media about an incident involving a NSW Police
  officer”. The boy and woman were taken to Queanbeyan police station after the
  incident. He was charged with stalking or intimidating with intent to cause
  fear of physical or mental harm (personal), contravening an apprehended
  violence order, and destroying or damaging property, and was granted
  conditional bail, to appear at a children’s court on Monday. She was charged
  with hinder or resist police officer in the execution of duty and two counts
  of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause fear or physical or mental
  harm, and was also granted conditional bail to appear in court on the same
  day. Aboriginal Legal Service CEO, Karly Warner, said they were unable to
  comment on the specifics of the incident while there were legal proceedings
  under way. “The Aboriginal Legal Service condemns police brutality in all
  circumstances. Aboriginal people are subjected to punitive police powers and
  excessive use of force at disproportionate rates. There is no room in our
  society for violence nor abuse of power especially from those who have sworn
  to serve and protect us. “There are strict laws and regulations about how NSW
  Police exercise their powers and for good reason. Robust and independent
  police oversight and accountability is critical. Decisive action where police
  misconduct is proven is essential to support community trust in police and a
  society where we can all feel safe.”
