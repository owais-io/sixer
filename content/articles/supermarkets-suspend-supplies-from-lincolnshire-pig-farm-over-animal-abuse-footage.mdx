  Three of the UK’s biggest supermarkets have suspended supplies from a
  Lincolnshire pig farm after footage filmed covertly by an animal rights
  organisation appeared to show workers kicking piglets and hitting them with
  boards and paddles. The footage also suggested the injured pigs with open
  wounds were packed into pens covered in faeces, with some left lame and
  writhing in pain. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons said they had
  “immediately” suspended supplies from Somerby Top Farm after becoming aware of
  the footage. The farm was bought by Cranswick, Britain’s largest pork
  supplier, in late 2023 and was audited and certified by the British animal
  welfare and food assurance scheme Red Tractor in October 2024. The animal
  rights group the Animal Justice Project (AJP) says it filmed the abuse between
  May 2024 and January 2025. It claims cameras hidden across the farm over this
  period showed legally required welfare checks often ignored visible injuries
  and suffering, such as a pig who was bleeding from a ruptured hernia, with
  official inspections of 1,000 pigs taking as little as 90 seconds. There were
  “multiple botched killings of lame piglets”, which left them in agony for more
  than 30 seconds after being shot, according to the Mail on Sunday, which
  obtained the undercover footage. Workers would routinely “hit pigs with
  boards, paddles and their fists, deliberately targeting areas such as their
  snout and eyes”. One piglet, which “showed clear signs of extreme pain”, was
  reportedly left dying for 33 hours as other piglets cannibalised an open
  wound. “He had no escape from being eaten alive,” said the narrator of the
  film published on the AJP website, claiming that workers ignored the pig’s
  squeals of distress. “During our filming, Somerby Top [Farm] was audited by
  Red Tractor,” the narrator said. “Yet just two weeks later, when we returned,
  we were met with the same squalid conditions.” Red Tractor said it could not
  verify this, but responded to the “deeply distressing” footage by suspending
  Somerby Top Farm’s certification with “immediate effect” and referring the
  farm to the government animal welfare regulator, the Animal and Plant Health
  Agency. “Red Tractor is conducting a thorough review of both current and
  historical footage, compliance and staffing on the farm,” the organisation
  said in a statement. “The farm will remain unassured if Red Tractor is not
  satisfied our standards are met.” They said footage had only been presented to
  Red Tractor this month. “This delay is concerning and suggests that these
  activists have prioritised ideology over protecting animal welfare. Red
  Tractor provides a free anonymous whistleblowing service and we actively
  encourage anyone with concerns to raise these so that we can investigate
  immediately.” In a statement, Cranswick said the health and welfare of its
  pigs was the company’s “highest priority”: “We are horrified to see the
  unacceptable treatment of pigs at Somerby Top Farm, [which was] historically
  recorded and brought to our attention this week.” The company added that since
  May, when covert footage filmed by AJP showed apparent abuse at another of its
  farms, North Moor Farm, it has installed CCTV at all its indoor pig farms,
  recruited five new welfare officers, retrained all its farm workers and
  commissioned an independent veterinarian-led review across all its farms. It
  said it had launched an investigation as soon as the AJP shared the footage:
  “The staff involved are no longer with the business.” Morrisons said: “We care
  deeply about Animal Welfare and these allegations are disturbing and
  unacceptable. We welcome Cranswick’s urgent investigation and have immediately
  suspended supply from this farm until further notice.”
