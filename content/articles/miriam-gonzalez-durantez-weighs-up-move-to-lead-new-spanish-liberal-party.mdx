  For almost 30 years, she let her husband, the former British deputy prime
  minister Nick Clegg, soak up the political limelight, but 10 years after he
  quit politics to join Facebook, Miriam González Durántez is weighing up a move
  to enter the political fray herself. The lawyer and former EU foreign adviser
  is considering heading a new liberal party in her native Spain after a
  perceived gap opened up after the collapse of the centre-liberal party
  Ciudadanos (Citizens) and amid ongoing crises in the current socialist
  government headed by Pedro Sánchez. It is understood she has had talks with
  the Renew grouping of liberal parties in Europe earlier this summer with a
  view to launching a party that aims to re-energise the political centre, not
  just in Spain but also in the EU. A lawyer by profession, with a formidable
  reputation, González Durántez is already laying the foundations for a
  potential move into the public arena. In 2023, she founded España Mejor,
  Better Spain, a non-profit political organisation which aims to encourage
  Spanish civil society to participate in the development of public policy.
  Among the goals of Better Spain, which some might read as the bones of a
  manifesto, are a new water policy, a “realistic” housing policy”, more and
  better jobs, tax proposals for young people, a tax policy “for everyone to
  grow”, and the elimination of special legal privileges for 250,000 people in
  Spain including public officials. At a public meeting of Better Spain in Cádiz
  on Friday, she said: “If civil society proves incapable of cleaning up
  politics I’ll consider establishing a political party,” the local La Voz de
  Cádiz reported. Clegg was a prominent politician in the UK, serving as leader
  of the Liberal Democrats between 2007 and 2015 and becoming deputy prime
  minister to Conservative David Cameron between 2010 and 2015, as part of the
  first full coalition government in Britain since 1945. During his tenure as
  leader, he rejected the “tribalism of left and right” and instead positioned
  the party in the “radical centre” of middle-income progressive voters. He
  supported reduced taxes, electoral reform, cuts and an increased focus on
  environmental issues. He stepped down as leader of the party after it was
  nearly wiped out in 2015 election, with some blaming the defeat on his
  decision to get into bed with the Conservatives in the first place, breaking a
  key election promise over university fees in the process. Clegg quit politics
  in the UK and took up a new role in 2018 in California as the head of global
  affairs and communications at Facebook. At the same time González Durántez
  pursued a number of interests including a mentoring project, Inspiring Girls
  International, and Altius Advisory, a consultancy she founded aimed at
  bettering business in Africa. Before that she spent years in Brussels and
  London advising on diversity, liberal reform, and international trade policy.
  They returned to the UK from California after Clegg left Meta in January and
  she now spends weekdays in Spain and weekends when she can in London,
  according to a recent interview. Her lengthy career included three stints as a
  member of cabinet in the EU’s external relations commission, including one as
  a senior trade adviser to Chris Patten, the former British commissioner for
  external relations. She also spent two years working as a negotiator at the
  World Trade Organization. Her father, José Antonio González Caviedes, was
  mayor of Olmedo and served as a senator for the conservative People’s party
  (PP) from 1989 until he died in 1996. González Durántez was not available for
  comment, but when asked if she was considering setting up her own party, a
  spokesperson for Better Spain said the lawyer had been working for the past
  two years to mobilise civil society and on effort to “clean up Spanish
  politics” and “end the pendulum of corruption and counteract polarisation”.
  The spokesperson added: “She has publicly stated on numerous occasions that if
  Spanish political parties continue to ignore civil society, she would consider
  other options including political ones. For the time being she continues
  working on those objectives within España Mejor. “As part of her work as the
  founder of España Mejor, she has held meetings with all sorts of
  organisations, public institutions, businesses and citizens across Spain, as
  well as multiple political parties, within Spain and Europe.” Founding a new
  party and bringing it to a position of political heft is laden with risk in
  Spain, as it is in any country. Spanish politics remains doggedly bipartisan,
  with the socialist and conservative parties rarely achieving an overall
  majority. While the two-party system has been loosened from both left
  (Podemos) and right (Vox) the attempt by Ciudadanos, led by Albert Rivera, a
  young lawyer, to break the deadlock fizzled out to the point that the party
  didn’t even contest the 2023 general election. Pablo Simón, a political
  scientist at the Carlos III university in Madrid, predicted an uphill struggle
  for González if she throws her hat into the ring. “This proposal for a new
  centrist party seems to come from above, not from the grassroots,” he said. “I
  think it’s a bad moment to launch such a party. For one thing, voters who are
  fed up with the government are moving the right and the far right and prefer
  pre-existing parties to new ones. It would make more sense to wait for the
  European elections when there is a better chance of gaining representation.
  “Miriam González is largely unknown in Spain. When you launch a party it’s
  best to have a someone well-known to front it. Perhaps González would make a
  better deputy than leader.” He added that liberal parties had had little
  success in newer democracies such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. “This
  is because, being new democracies, the politics are polarised between left and
  right.” Political power couples It may be some time before Miriam González
  Durántez decides whether to follow her husband’s footsteps into formal
  politics, but if she does she will join an illustrious list of power couples
  who have graced the world stage. 1. Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton Although
  she was unsuccessful in her attempt to follow Bill into the White House,
  Hillary Clinton and her husband were at one time the most powerful couple in
  modern American politics. A lawyer, politician and diplomat, Hillary achieved
  high office in her own right as two-time senator for New York and US secretary
  of state. The pair continue to wield influence with the Clinton Foundation. 2.
  Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela Before their divorce and her marginalisation
  after his release from prison in 1990, the couple were considered the mother
  and father of the nation of South Africa. Winnie Mandela became an MP and a
  minister and during the fight against apartheid she was a potent symbol of the
  struggle, but her reputation was seriously damaged several times by
  allegations of murder and corruption. She was convicted of kidnapping,
  assault, theft and fraud. As one of the most visible faces of the resistance,
  she was regularly detained and harassed by the police and considered so
  powerful she was even prohibited from speaking to the media. 3. Cristina
  Fernández de Kirchner and Néstor Kirchner Cristina Fernández de Kirchner
  became the first woman to be elected president of Argentina in 2007, a role
  she held until 2015. Succeeding her husband Néstor, the charismatic but
  divisive figure was permanently banned from public office in June over a
  corruption conviction.
