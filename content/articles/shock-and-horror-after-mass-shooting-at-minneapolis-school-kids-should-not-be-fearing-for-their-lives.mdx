  Leaders and parents across the US have reacted in shock and horror as yet
  another mass shooting has struck the country, this time at a Minneapolis
  Catholic school where an assailant opened fire on children gathered in a
  church celebrating their first mass of the new school year. Authorities said
  the shooting took place Wednesday morning at Annunciation Catholic school. Two
  children, ages eight and 10, were shot and killed as they sat in a pew at
  Annunciation church. About 17 other people were hurt, with 14 of them being
  children. As details emerged, political leaders released statements on the
  shooting. Minnesota governor Tim Walz wrote on social media: “I’m praying for
  our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific
  act of violence.” Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey urged politicians to take
  greater actions in preventing gun violence, saying during a Wednesday press
  conference: “Every one of us needs to be wrapping our arms around these
  families, giving them every ounce that we can muster. These were Minneapolis
  families. These were American families, and the amount of pain that they are
  suffering right now is extraordinary.” He added: “Don’t just say, this is
  about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It
  was the first week of school. They were in a church.” Senators Amy Klobuchar
  and Tina Smith have also been briefed on the incident, with Klobuchar writing:
  “I am heartbroken by the horrific violence at Annunciation Catholic School in
  Minneapolis this morning. My prayers are with the students, teachers, and
  families, and I am grateful for the first responders who are on the scene.”
  Smith wrote: “My staff and I are monitoring the situation at Annunciation
  Catholic School. I’m grateful for the quick response of law enforcement as we
  continue to gather information. It’s the first week of school. These kids
  should not be fearing for their lives.” Representative Ilhan Omar posted on
  social media: “I am beyond heartbroken over the tragic news of the shooting at
  Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. I am praying for all the families
  impacted by this horrific tragedy.” Donald Trump took to his Truth Social
  platform, writing: “I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in
  Minneapolis, Minnesota. The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene.
  The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please join
  me in praying for everyone involved!” It was reported Wednesday that the
  president and Walz had spoken about the shooting. Bill Bienemann, a local who
  lives just a couple of blocks away and is a longtime attendee of mass at
  Annunciation church, told the Associated Press that he had heard dozens of
  shots, perhaps as many as 50, over as long as four minutes. “I was shocked. I
  said: ‘There’s no way that could be gunfire,’” he said. “There was so much of
  it. It was sporadic.” Bienemann’s daughter, Alexandra, said she attended the
  school from kindergarten to eighth grade, finishing in 2014. She told
  reporters that after she heard of the shooting, she was shaking and crying,
  and her boss told her to take the day off. “It breaks my heart, makes me sick
  to my stomach, knowing that there are people I know who are either injured or
  maybe even killed,” Alexandra Bienemann said. “It doesn’t make me feel safe at
  all in this community that I have been in for so long.” The shooting marks the
  fourth deadly shooting in 24 hours in Minneapolis. Over the course of Tuesday
  into Wednesday, three people were shot and killed in three separate shootings.
  Despite this morning’s shootings not appearing to be connected to the
  shootings of the previous day, police said: “The level of gun violence across
  the city within the last day is deeply unsettling. Across three separate
  multiple-victim shootings, eight people have been injured by gunfire and three
  have lost their lives.” US school shootings continue to be an ongoing crisis.
  Last month, CNN reported that there had been 33 school shootings in the US in
  2025 as of 25 July. Of these incidents, 14 were on K-12 school grounds and 19
  were on college campuses. The shootings left 15 people dead and at least 41
  other victims injured, according to the analysis. Former representative
  Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at a meet-and-greet event outside
  a grocery store in 2011, said: “When will enough be enough?” She added: “I am
  heartbroken that yet another community is affected by a mass shooting. This
  doesn’t have to be the reality for anyone.” Speaking to reporters, local
  police chief Brian O’Hara said: “This was a deliberate act of violence against
  innocent children and other people worshipping. The sheer cruelty and
  cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely
  incomprehensible.”
