  A group of women in Melbourne have been injured, and a police officer in
  Sydney was allegedly assaulted, after anti-immigration marches across
  Australia on the weekend. A group of men, including some members of neo-Nazi
  group the National Socialist Network, attacked the standing First Nations
  protest site, Camp Sovereignty, in Melbourne’s Kings Domain on Sunday evening,
  according to video footage seen by Guardian Australia. The footage showed at
  least 50 men, mostly clad in black, approaching the Camp Sovereignty site as
  the sun was setting. The site is identifiable by the large letters spelling
  out the camp’s name erected on the grass. In the footage, the men attack the
  letters in an apparent attempt to knock them down, and then begin violently
  swinging sticks and poles at camp activists. In a statement on Monday morning,
  Camp Sovereignty and the Black Peoples Union said the group appeared and
  allegedly “completely unprovoked, they ran up the hill and immediately
  targeted women, grabbing them, throwing them to the ground, and striking them
  in the head”. Four people required medical attention and two were taken to
  hospital with severe head injuries, one with a deep gash to their head, the
  camp said. A spokesperson told Guardian Australia all of those injured were
  younger women of colour. Sign up: AU Breaking News email They alleged the men
  yelled slogans such as “white power” and “white man’s land”, as well as sexist
  and racist slurs. One member of the community, a 30-year-old primary school
  teacher who did not want to be identified, alleged in the statement: “I had
  what looked like a 15-year-old boy rip my hair, throw me to the ground and
  smash into my face with his fists. He did it with a smile on his face. I
  couldn’t believe it.” The camp believed it was targeted and the group of men
  appeared at the time they regularly held community gatherings and ceremonies.
  A spokesperson for Victoria police said crime investigation unit detectives
  were investigating “an affray in Southbank”. “It is understood a group were
  gathered in parkland off St Kilda Road about 5pm when they were approached by
  a second group,” the spokesperson said. “Officers have been told the second
  group formed a line in front of the first group, before assaulting various
  members of the first group with sticks and flag poles. Officers attended and
  moved the second group on. A man and woman were both given medical assistance
  at the scene. The investigation remains ongoing.” A spokesperson for Ambulance
  Victoria said they were called to an incident at about 5.05pm. “A woman in her
  30s with upper body injuries was transported by road ambulance to The Alfred
  [hospital] in a stable condition,” the spokesperson said. Victorian senator
  Lidia Thorpe, whose uncle, Krautungalung elder Robbie Thorpe, established the
  camp on a sacred Aboriginal burial site, said the alleged “unprovoked,
  coordinated Nazi attack on Aboriginal people” was “racism out on full display”
  and ought to be investigated as a hate crime. “The aim of this attack was to
  cause fear and terror in the hearts and minds of our people, and Black and
  Brown people across the country,” Thorpe said in a statement. Meanwhile, in
  Sydney, two people were charged after a brawl erupted in a Broadway hotel and
  a police officer was allegedly assaulted. Police attended the hotel at about
  5.40pm on Sunday after reports that a group of people at the bar were “yelling
  offensively at passersby before a brawl ensued”, a NSW police spokesperson
  said. “Police arrived and attempted to disperse the group. It will be alleged
  that a 48-year-old man assaulted a male constable,” NSW police said in a
  statement. “When the constable attempted to arrest the man, it will be further
  alleged that a 29-year-old man also assaulted the officer.” The officer
  suffered minor injuries. Police deployed capsicum spray and both men ran from
  the scene. They were arrested “after a short foot pursuit” and were charged
  with affray, assaulting a police officer and hindering or resisting a police
  officer in the execution of duty, police said. The men were refused bail and
  were scheduled to appear in court on Monday. The incidents came after
  neo-Nazis led marches and addressed crowds at anti-immigration so-called March
  for Australia rallies in state and territory capitals across the country on
  Sunday. The rallies drew significant crowds in Melbourne and Sydney, and
  resulted in tense and volatile confrontations with anti-fascist
  counter-protesters in Melbourne. Victoria police said 12 people were arrested
  at the Melbourne rallies on Sunday and a further six people had been removed
  from the area “to prevent any criminal offending”. The Melbourne CBD had been
  declared a designated area to allow for weapon searches, with 135 searches
  being conducted and six people ordered to remove their face coverings. In a
  statement on Monday, police said they “had to use a range of tactical options
  including OC spray, baton rounds and public order munitions to prevent
  violence between protestors, some of whom were intent on creating conflict and
  violence”. The demonstrations were promoted by neo-Nazis, as well as
  anti-lockdown figures who gained prominence during the pandemic and other
  fringe groups, but no group publicly claimed responsibility for organising the
  protests. While the protests were condemned as hateful by the federal
  government, some politicians attended. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson,
  and party member Senator Malcolm Roberts attended a march in Canberra, and the
  federal MP Bob Katter appeared in Townsville. The Victorian police minister,
  Anthony Carbines, condemned the protests as “disgraceful”. “People who choose
  to attend such rallies – addressed by convicted criminals and members of
  neo-Nazi groups, as we saw yesterday – need to be called out and condemned for
  their associations at those rallies,” Carbines told ABC radio on Monday.
  “Victorians need to continue to call it out, Victorians need to continue to
  have a positive attitude, to celebrate our diversity and wrap their arms
  around people in the community who feel that they’re being blamed for the sort
  of petty whingers and gripes and the discrimination and racism of a fringe
  element.” Carbines said most rallies in Melbourne’s CBD, including
  pro-Palestine rallies that have been held every Sunday for almost two years,
  were “largely peaceful”. But Sunday “brought violence to the streets of
  Melbourne”, including Camp Sovereignty at King’s Domain. “Police will be
  investigating those matters, they’ll also be in contact with members of Camp
  Sovereignty and a lot of our First Nations people who are deeply distressed
  and upset with that activity yesterday, and this is what happens, isn’t it,
  when you have bullies in the community who roam in packs to intimidate others.
  It’s gutless, and it needs to be called out, and we will hold those people to
  account.” Victoria’s deputy premier, Ben Carroll, said on Monday that
  immigration was the state’s “secret sauce”. “Our migrants should be
  celebrated,” he said. “They shouldn’t be, in any way, frowned upon. The
  success of Victoria is indeed the secret sauce of migration.” The New South
  Wales premier, Chris Minns, told reporters he was “probably as confused as
  most people” about the protests’ origins. “If you go to a rally and the Nazis
  turn up, it’s not one you should be at, and no one can deny that they were
  there. No one can deny that racist language was used,” Minns said on Monday.
  “[Hate speech] laws apply to everybody, and they apply equally, and if you
  stand up and indulge in racism, then you’re subject to the full force of the
  law.” The federal minister for multiculturalism, Anne Aly, said neo-Nazis had
  used the rallies to “prey on some legitimate concerns around housing and
  around cost of living”. Aly told ABC radio on Monday that said the rallies
  were “clearly racist”, even if not everyone who attended was a neo-Nazi. “I
  would say to those who marched and who argued that they have … those
  legitimate concerns, that they were organised by Nazis, the very purpose of
  them was anti-immigration. “One of the very clear calls to action that was
  listed there was anti-Indian immigration, against people coming from India.
  Now that, to me, is clearly racist when you target a specific ethnicity.”
