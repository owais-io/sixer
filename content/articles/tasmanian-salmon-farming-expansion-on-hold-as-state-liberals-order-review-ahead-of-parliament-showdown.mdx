  The Tasmanian Liberal party has promised a pause on salmon farm expansion and
  an independent review of the industry as it attempts to win support from
  crossbench MPs and survive a no-confidence motion in the state parliament this
  week. In a concession to independent MPs critical of the operation of salmon
  farms in public waterways, the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, on Sunday said he
  supported the industry but that it was “on notice” after a mass mortality
  event last summer, and it must “operate transparently and responsibly and meet
  its obligations to the community”. He said the government would respond by
  introducing a marine environment act to strengthen regulation of the industry
  and order a study by an “off-island specialist organisation”. There would be a
  pause on industry expansion while it was completed, he said. “We know how
  important transparency is to the industry so we expect them to fully
  participate in the study,” Rockliff said. “Our government would want to see
  from this study practical reforms and smarter regulations that protect our
  environment, but also investment certainty for industry.” The state parliament
  returns on Tuesday after a snap election last month that was called after the
  parliament passed a no-confidence motion in Rockliff moved by the Labor
  leader, Dean Winter. Voters responded by delivering a parliament highly
  similar to the last one: 14 Liberals, 10 Labor MPs, five Greens and six other
  crossbenchers. With all parties short of the 18 seats needed for a majority,
  Rockliff and Winter have spent the past month jockeying for support. As the
  incumbent, Rockliff has been reappointed as premier until parliament returns,
  but Winter has promised that either he or an independent would move a vote of
  no confidence in the Liberals and a vote of confidence in Labor on the first
  day back. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Liberals’ concession on salmon
  was welcomed by some crossbenchers on Sunday. It followed the revelation last
  week that an endemic bacteria, Piscirickettsia salmonis, which caused an
  unprecedented mass mortality event at salmon farms last summer, was again
  present at elevated levels at farms in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, south of
  Hobart. Rockliff’s commitment matches some of the measures suggested by two
  independent MPs, Peter George and Craig Garland, in a letter to the major
  parties last week. George told Guardian Australia the announcement was “a real
  step forward”. “If it was to be adhered to in good faith we’d see it as a real
  win, but the devil is in the detail,” he said. Garland, who had previously
  indicated he would back Labor, said he “cautiously welcomed” Rockliff’s
  announcement, but also wanted more detail. He said Tasmania’s oceans were “in
  trouble”, and called on Labor to back the Liberals’ commitment. “Over summer
  we’ve seen rotting salmon lining our beaches, and salps and jellyfish choking
  our waterways, and we now watch with dread the ecological disaster unfolding
  in South Australia, where dolphins, sharks and fish are washing up dead on
  beaches,” he said. “Before things can get better, we must stop them from
  getting worse.” The Greens leader, Rosalie Woodruff, said the Liberals’
  announcement was a “potential turning point” and suggested the government had
  “finally recognised that something must be done”. But she said the party would
  be cautious as the Liberals had a “terrible record of inaction on
  environmental protection”. Labor’s spokesperson for aquaculture and the
  environment, Janie Finlay, said Rockliff had broken promises on reviews into
  other issues in the state, including the budget and controversial plans to
  build an AFL stadium on the Hobart waterfront, and should not be believed.
  “The only thing Jeremy Rockliff cares about is clinging to power, and he will
  say anything, promise anything, and break his word on everything, just to keep
  his job,” she said. The salmon pledge is the latest in a series of
  announcements since the election aimed at winning cross bench support.
  Rockliff ditched a plan to open nearly 40,000 hectares of protected forest for
  logging and said he would ban greyhound racing from 2029. The new treasurer,
  Eric Abetz, last week held a multi-party meeting including Greens and
  independent MPs to discuss how to deal with the state’s ballooning debt and
  promised the discussions would be ongoing. Winter has said an upper house
  independent, Ruth Forrest, would be treasurer in a Labor government. On
  Sunday, he released his pitch to the crossbench, a “framework for
  collaboration”, focusing on budget repair and “restoring trust and integrity”
  in government. He reiterated that he would not do a deal with the Greens
  despite needing their support to form government. After a meeting with Winter
  last week, Woodruff said the Labor leader had “not made a serious attempt” at
  negotiating and her party could not support a no-confidence motion in the
  Liberals “at this stage”. On Sunday, the independent MP David O’Byrne, a
  former Labor leader and cabinet minister, said he would back Rockliff
  remaining as premier as the Liberals were the only party able to form a
  “workable majority” in parliament. The Liberals are aiming for a fifth
  straight term in government. They increased their primary vote by 3.2% to
  nearly 39.9% at last month’s election. Labor’s vote fell 3.1% to 25.9%. The
  Greens’ vote rose slightly to 14.4% of the vote. Other parties and
  crossbenchers received a combined 19.8%.
