  My father, Charlie Partridge, who has died aged 72 after suffering
  complications from cancer, was a journalist, broadcaster and champion of local
  media. Having begun his career at Radio Trent, he moved to the BBC’s Radio
  Nottingham in 1978 before joining Radio Humberside, eventually presenting the
  breakfast show. Always up for an attention-grabbing stunt, he once broadcast
  from a RAF Lightning fast jet, and on one April Fools’ Day claimed the town of
  Goole would be rebranding itself as “Go Olé”. He moved on to become news
  editor at BBC Essex and despite being serious about his journalism he also
  starred in a regular feature on the station in which listeners would have to
  guess what song he was performing “in a pub singer style”. In 1999 Charlie
  became managing editor of BBC Radio Lincolnshire, where his belief in the
  power of local media to create and bind communities together led to campaigns,
  alongside Lincolnshire Life magazine, for a Lincolnshire flag and a
  Lincolnshire Day (now marked on 1 October). Unusual sightings of the flag
  became a fixture of our family’s WhatsApp group, with it appearing in the
  crowd at Glastonbury and at the Tour de France, and inspiring a number of
  Lincoln City FC away shirts. His biggest source of professional pride,
  however, was the number of successful journalists he had either trained or
  worked with early on in their BBC careers. Born in Plymouth to Ronald
  Partridge, a civil servant, and Vera (nee Harrington), Charlie moved with his
  family to Gloucester at the age of seven. He was educated at the Crypt grammar
  school and then the University of Nottingham, where he studied politics. It
  was in Nottingham that he alighted on the world of radio as a career, after a
  short detour into teaching. There, too, he met Jill Rowland, whom he married
  in 1981, and who later worked as an academic librarian at the University of
  Lincoln. They went on to have three sons, Simon, Dominic and me. A lifelong
  football fan, Charlie’s passion for the game was sparked by childhood visits
  to Home Park and later on he was, I’m pretty sure, the only Plymouth Argyle
  supporter with a season ticket for Lincoln City, whose games he attended
  alongside his sons. He was also a keen skier and cyclist. Retiring from the
  BBC after 42 years amid the pandemic in 2020, he went on to work as mayor’s
  officer at the Guildhall in Lincoln, where his duties included carrying the
  mace as part of the lord mayor’s procession. He is survived by Jill, Simon,
  Dominic and me, and his grandchildren, Finlay and Anna, and sister, Caroline.
