  I grew up in the English countryside, watching Queer as Folk on TV and
  dreaming about the day I’d move to the city and get to be part of the gay
  world. At age 18, in the mid-noughties, I packed up and left for Manchester,
  moving into the university halls of residence. I was thrilled. On my first
  night out, I went to a popular gay club night and got stupendously drunk. The
  university halls were only a five-minute walk away, but I was alone. Around
  2am, I found myself propped against a wall outside a takeaway, unable to
  remember how to get back to my bed. Spotting me in trouble, Nana, who was
  lovingly known as the oldest drag queen in Manchester, came up to me and
  asked: “‘Are you OK, chicken?” Nana was a Manchester institution. She had
  campaigned a lot during the HIV/Aids crisis in the 1980s and 90s. In the 2000s
  she’d often show up late at night to hand ice blocks out to drunk young
  partiers to help sober them up. She’d say: “Here’s something to suck on,
  boys,” which made everyone laugh. I told Nana I lived at the university, but
  that I’d just moved here and didn’t know where I was going. Without
  hesitation, she replied: “Come on love, let’s get you home.” Nana escorted me
  back, got me safely into my room, tucked me into bed and saw herself out. All
  of this, dressed in drag. Her parting words were: “Nana loves you – now be
  careful.” Looking back now, I can see how much of a vulnerable situation I had
  put myself in, as an 18-year-old in an unfamiliar environment. But Nana, who
  was probably in her early 60s at that point, took me under her wing. She got
  me home safely then just disappeared, like a gay fairy godmother. Nana died
  about three years ago. Canal Street, the gay strip in Manchester, effectively
  went into mourning. Nana had touched so many lives but it wasn’t until after
  she passed and we all started trading stories of what Nana had done for us
  that we realised how wonderful she really was. For years there had been this
  fabulous person in the background who was looking after her community but not
  expecting any thanks for it. Vale Nana. What is the nicest thing a stranger
  has ever done for you? If you’re having trouble using the form click here.
