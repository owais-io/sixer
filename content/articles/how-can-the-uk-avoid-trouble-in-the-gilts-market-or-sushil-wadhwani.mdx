  Assume that Rip Van Winkle had gone to sleep on the eve of the US election on
  4 November 2024 and had woken up on 1 September 2025 and was told that, in the
  US, developments included: a) Donald Trump had been talking of firing Jerome
  Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, and asserting that only those who
  believed that short-term interest rates needed to be a lot lower were
  qualified to be the next Fed chair. Moreover, he had attempted to take the
  unprecedented step of firing a board governor. b) The new US budget had been
  seen by the Congressional Budget Office as adding $3.4tn (£2.5tn) to the
  national debt over the next 10 years. By contrast, in the UK: a) The
  government had worked hard to stay within its fiscal rules and had made no
  attempt to interfere with the independence of the Bank of England. b) In terms
  of the outlook for monetary policy, two-year yields in the UK and US had come
  down by about the same amount. Under these circumstances, it would be
  reasonable for Van Winkle to expect that US yields would have risen by more
  than in the UK. Hence, his astonishment when told that UK 30-year yields had
  risen by more than in the US. In talking to investors, I encounter strongly
  divergent views regarding Van Winkle’s puzzle. One group believes that this
  represents an anomaly and, given a catalyst, UK gilts (bonds) should
  outperform US treasuries. By contrast, some others believe that the UK gilts
  market is heading towards a full-blown crisis because of fiscal sustainability
  concerns. This camp points to the historical tendency of the Office for Budget
  Responsibility to be too optimistic with regard to its fiscal projections.
  They also worry that the OBR’s growth projections are too high. They point out
  that the OBR did not believe that the October 2024 budget would boost growth
  over a five-year period and are worried that recent tax changes have driven
  entrepreneurs away and changed the image of the UK as a place to invest. It is
  important to recall that market pricing is often dominated by the prevailing
  narrative. At the moment, the bond vigilantes are also circling in France. It
  is therefore time for the UK government to be bold and to change the image of
  the UK. This requires highly significant and eye-catching measures. Tinkering
  will not do. First, the autumn budget needs to be seen to be credible in terms
  of the fiscal projections. This will necessarily require some tough decisions.
  Second, the budget should raise revenue without hurting growth. The achilles
  heel of the 2024 budget was the rise in employer national insurance
  contributions, which was seen as hurting employment. It is therefore time to
  be bold and the government should engage in significant tax reform. By way of
  example, the introduction of a tax on land could raise revenue and actually
  increase growth if taxes on work could thereby be reduced over time. Recall
  that the quantity of land does not react negatively to a tax on its return,
  while labour supply and capital investment do. Continuing to raise taxes in
  ways that hurt growth might intensify fears that the current government is
  caught in a “doom loop” whereby each budget needs to raise taxes further
  because prior taxes hurt work or investment. I am therefore encouraged by
  recent speculation that the government is looking afresh at property taxes.
  Third, policies that are widely seen as increasing growth would help. These
  policies need to have a significant wow factor. An example would be joining
  the customs union. Fourth, the UK needs to emphasise to markets that the Bank
  of England is more independent than the Federal Reserve. One way of doing so
  would be to allow the Bank to set its own inflation target. Fifth, I argued a
  couple of years ago that inflation expectations in the UK were running higher
  than the inflation target. I said then that this would make the Bank of
  England slower to cut rates when, as now, the labour market was weakening. At
  the time, I resurrected an idea originally proposed by many distinguished
  economists – a tax on companies that give their staff inflation-busting pay
  deals. I continue to believe that such a tax would be rewarded by the gilts
  market and would allow the Bank to cut rates sooner. Sixth, the Bank needs to
  play its part here. It needs to make it known that it takes unwarranted moves
  in gilt yields into account in its monetary policy decisions and would
  therefore respond to, for example, contagion from the US. It also needs to
  reconsider its policy relating to quantitative tightening. To conclude, the
  government has an opportunity to increase growth and reduce its debt interest
  bill at the next budget. Boldness will be rewarded by markets now and, very
  likely, the electorate eventually. • Sushil Wadhwani is an economist and a
  former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee
