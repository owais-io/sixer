  The mayor of Chicago has signed an executive order outlining how the city will
  attempt to resist Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Brandon Johnson pushed
  back on Saturday against what he called the “out-of-control” Trump
  administration’s plan to deploy large numbers of federal officers into the
  country’s third-largest city, which could take place within days. The Chicago
  police department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil
  immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints
  during the surge, according to the executive order Johnson signed. The mayor
  directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago
  residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or
  national guard deployment by the federal government”. When asked during a news
  conference about federal agents who are presumably “taking orders”, Johnson
  replied: “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.” Johnson
  also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their
  identities, as most federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers
  have adopted since the Trump administration took charge this year. Last week,
  the White House requested that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago
  be made available to assist with immigration operations, as the Trump
  administration plans a broader takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”.
  Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the
  state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against
  cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put
  the city and state at odds with Trump’s mass deportation agenda. On Thursday,
  Tom Homan, the administration’s “border czar”, said Chicago, along with a
  number of other cities, would soon be targeted in a planned immigration
  crackdown. “Operations are ramping up across the country. But you can see a
  ramp-up across the operations in Chicago, absolutely,” Homan said. In an
  interview with Fox News, Homan was asked whether he wanted to give a message
  to Johnson. Homan responded: “Get out of the way, because we’re going to do
  it.” Johnson had harsh words for Trump during his news conference, accusing
  the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the constitution” and seeking
  a federal presence in blue cities as retribution against his political rivals.
  “He is reckless and out of control,” Johnson said. “He’s the biggest threat to
  our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country.” In
  response, the White House insisted the potential flood of federal agents was
  about “cracking down on crime”. NBC News reported that Ice, the border patrol
  and other agencies will send numerous agents and equipment to Chicago as soon
  as next week, in an attempt to increase arrests of undocumented immigrants.
  The planned move comes weeks after the president deployed armed soldiers and
  military vehicles to patrol the streets of Washington DC, claiming, despite
  all available evidence, that the use of the national guard was necessary to
  control crime. The Trump administration has been working on plans to send the
  national guard to Chicago, something Johnson and JB Pritzker, the governor of
  Illinois, have said would be an abuse of power. On Friday, Pritzker said such
  a move would amount to an “invasion”. He told CBS News that, should Trump send
  in the national guard, voters “should understand that he has other aims, other
  than fighting crime”. Pritzker said those aims may be to “stop the elections
  in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections”. Johnson’s office did
  not immediately respond to a request for comment. “If these Democrats focused
  on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to
  criticize the president, their communities would be much safer,” said White
  House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. “Cracking down on crime should not be a
  partisan issue, but Democrats suffering from TDS are trying to make it one.
  They should listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser who recently
  celebrated the Trump Administration’s success in driving down violent crime in
  Washington DC.” Reuters and Associated Press contributed reporting
