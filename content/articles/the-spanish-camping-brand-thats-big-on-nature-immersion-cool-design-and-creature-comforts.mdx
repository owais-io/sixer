  A few years ago, camping with friends, I watched in awe as Becky set up her
  pitch. While the rest of us were stringing out guy ropes on tents as glamorous
  as giant cagoules, she arrived with a bell tent, duvets instead of sleeping
  bags, sheepskin rugs and vintage folding chairs. For all the talk of
  breathability, practicality and “high performance” gear, it was Becky’s tent
  we all wanted to sleep in. In the years since, I have never quite achieved her
  level of camping chic – until this summer, when I discovered the innovative
  Spanish camping brand Kampaoh. It all began back in 2016, when Kampaoh CEO
  Salvador Lora and his partner were backpacking in the Dominican Republic. One
  night they came across a campsite with pre-erected tents within which were
  mattresses and blankets. “We were in the middle of nature, surrounded by
  peace, and lacked nothing,” he tells me. Back home in Spain, Salvador wondered
  if something like that could work there – and decided to experiment setting up
  a handful of tents in Tarifa. Today the company has 90 sites across Europe,
  most of them in Spain, but also in Portugal and Italy. Coming across the brand
  by chance when looking for somewhere to stay in Andalucía, I booked into
  Camping Los Villares, one of its showcase sites, in the hills above Córdoba.
  Arriving in the golden hour, after travelling overland by train, Los Villares
  looks like a dreamy backdrop to a Sofia Coppola film. From the entrance, the
  land drops gently away to reveal avenues of cream-coloured canvas tents, the
  sun filtering through tall Aleppo pines. Los Villares has a wide range of
  accommodation, from bell tents to vast, safari-style Bali tents, cute
  triangular Buka tents (with private, rustic-chic washrooms outside), Tiny Love
  cabins (with private baths with views), and Tiny Play family cabins (with a
  slide from their mezzanine bunks down to the living areas). My mid-range Anza
  is a lofty, triangular tent with a shower and toilet tucked behind the
  sleeping area and a raised, decked porch. The site is open year-round and the
  tents have air-conditioning and a small heater. There’s space for basic tent
  campers and a small campervan area, too. Outside the school holidays, with the
  campsite’s restaurant closed midweek, dinner that first night is sliced
  tomatoes, olives and tortilla foraged from a nearby village shop. As I eat on
  the terrace, all is deeply peaceful – the wind twisting through pines,
  blue-tailed Iberian magpies resting on branches overhead. Inside, my white,
  cream and wood tent is decorated with fairy lights and faux pot plants; the
  low platform bed (with proper mattress and pillows!) made up with white
  bedlinen. Plates, cups and cutlery are provided – and if I’d brought a pet, a
  mini version of the tent would provide a shady dog bed. An information sheet
  encourages me to tag @kampaoh on social media; arrival details had been sent
  via WhatsApp. It’s perfectly designed to appeal to gen Z travellers, the
  experience-seeking, social media-canny cohort that are becoming the dominant
  demographic in travel. While aesthetics are important, blingy, performative
  luxury is not; conscious of overtourism and the need to prioritise wellbeing,
  they look for off-the-beaten-track outdoor stays where they can run, swim,
  surf and cycle, as well as social connection. If Kampaoh’s campsites ticked
  any more of the demographic’s boxes it would break TikTok. “We wanted to bring
  back the magic of connecting with nature and outdoor adventures without giving
  up comfort or style,” says Lora. “The new generation love experiences like
  camping but they also have high expectations for design, comfort and
  aesthetics. Visual appeal isn’t superficial; it’s part of how we live and
  share our experiences.” Kampaoh isn’t the only camping brand tapping into this
  market. In France, the Parisian hotel brand Touriste recently launched three
  stylishly revamped holiday parks under its Campings Liberté brand, while
  Huttopia, which began in 2000 with a small, nature-based campsite in the
  French Alps and a devotion to wood and canvas structures, now offers 152 sites
  in eight countries. Unlike other glamping providers, the aim is not to add on
  hotel-style frills, but to increase basic comfort. Setting themselves apart
  from big, pre-erected tent and cabin operators such as Eurocamp, operators
  like Kampaoh keep sites relatively small and, crucially, stylish. As I sit on
  the restaurant’s terrace sipping coffee the next morning, shielded by fig
  trees, I watch a steady trickle of campers heading out for the day in hiking
  or cycling gear. It was 37C in Córdoba when I collected my hire car, but up
  here it’s a pleasant 26C. With the smell of hot pine needles in the air, I
  follow them out to explore. The campsite is in the Parque Periurbano Los
  Villares, a protected area of 484 hectares (2 sq miles) that’s peppered with
  bird hides, signposted botanical trails and picnic areas. The GR48
  long-distance footpath goes through it, and a network of cycling routes around
  it. After hiking up to a viewpoint behind the park’s visitor centre to get my
  bearings, I drive to the small town of Santa María de Trassierra to walk the
  20-minute path to the Baños de Popea. Remote and jungly, this river pool was a
  favourite spot with Córdoba’s Cántico group of poets and artists in the late
  1940s. The tumble of small waterfalls and pools – full from unusual spring
  rain – form a magical spot, reached through glades of bear’s breech (Acanthus
  mollis), and paths edged with beams of gorse-like French broom.I could easily
  spend all day here, but there’s still Córdoba to see, with its parks of orange
  trees, the shady gardens of the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos and the famous
  mosque-cathedral of Mezquita. The highlight, for me, however, is the Medina
  Azahara archaeological site, just out of town. Its construction was started in
  936 by the first caliph of Al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman III. This palace-city saw
  service for only 70 years but its evocative ruins and richly decorated
  archways are a powerful reminder of its opulence. Walking the Medina’s ancient
  stones as grasshoppers hop and jasmine scents the hot air, it’s easy to see
  the appeal of this strategic location, between the mountains and the
  Guadalquivir River. Driving into the campsite afterwards, off a road flushed
  with hot pink oleanders, the landscape is washed in pale gold. Momentarily
  distracted by the view, I double-take as four hoopoes suddenly appear in front
  of me, their black and white stripes backlit by the sun. I probably ought to
  have taken a photo and posted it with the hashtag #kampaohvibes. Instead, I
  keep very still and watch. Some experiences are still tailormade for us
  analogue Gen Xers. The trip was provided by the Spanish Tourist Office, with
  support from Andalucía and Kampaoh, which is open all year. Anza tents at
  Kampaoh Córdoba cost from €63 a night for two people, or from €76 a night for
  four; both minimum two nights
