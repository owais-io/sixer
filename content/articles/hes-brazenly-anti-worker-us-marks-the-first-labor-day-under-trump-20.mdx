  For this Labor Day, the Donald Trump administration has draped an enormous
  banner outside the US labor department with his portrait and the words
  “American Workers First.” Trump was elected on promises, since repeatedly
  pledged, that he would fight for workers and forgotten Americans. But many
  labor advocates say that Trump has consistently put corporate interests first
  in his second term as he has taken dozens of actions that hurt workers, often
  by cutting their pay or making their jobs more dangerous. Despite his vow to
  help coal miners, Trump halted enforcement of a regulation that protects
  miners from a debilitating, often deadly lung disease. He fired the chair of
  the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog
  without a quorum to protect workers from corporations’ illegal anti-union
  tactics. Angering labor leaders, Trump stripped one million federal workers of
  their right to bargain collectively and tore up their union contracts. “It’s a
  big betrayal,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the main US labor
  federation, said. “We knew it would be bad, but we had no idea how rapidly he
  would be doing these things. He is stripping away regulations that protect
  workers. His attacks on unions are coming fast and furious. He talks a good
  game of being for working people, but he’s doing the absolute opposite.” “This
  is a government that is by, and for, the CEOs and billionaires,” Shuler added.
  Trump has hurt construction workers by shutting down major wind turbine
  projects and ending Biden-era subsidies that encourage the construction of
  factories that make renewable-energy products. In moves that will harm some of
  the nation’s most vulnerable workers, the Trump administration has proposed
  ending minimum wage and overtime protections for 3.7 million home-care and
  domestic workers. It has also killed a Biden plan to prevent employers from
  paying disabled workers less than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage.
  “There is a huge disconnect between Trump’s pro-worker rhetoric and the
  policies he’s putting in place. The gulf is enormous,” said Heidi Shierholz,
  president of the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank. “In his
  second term, he’s been absolutely, brazenly anti-worker.” “I keep thinking
  about his taking away the Biden-era increase in the minimum wage for federal
  contractors. It’s unbelievably brazen,” Shierholz continued. (Trump ended the
  requirement that federal contractors pay their workers at least $17.75 an
  hour.) “The minimum wage is incredibly popular. He just took away the minimum
  wage from hundreds of thousands of workers. That blew my mind.” As a result,
  many full-time workers will see their pay drop by more than $9,200 a year. The
  administration disputes all these criticisms. “The American worker has been
  left behind by the Democrat party for years, but President Trump has
  championed an agenda that puts the American worker first,” said Taylor Rogers,
  White House assistant press secretary. Trump has “unleashed an economic boom”,
  she said. Inflation is cooling, native-born Americans are benefiting from
  private-sector job gains and blue-collar wages are rising fast. “Under
  President Trump’s leadership, Republicans are once again the party of the
  American worker,” said Rogers. Many labor experts say Trump is even more
  anti-union than Ronald Reagan, often called the most anti-union president of
  modern times. Reagan fired 11,345 air traffic controllers who went on strike,
  but the AFL-CIO’s Shuler said that “pales in comparison” to Trump’s ending
  collective bargaining for 1 million federal workers. “That’s the largest
  single act of union-busting in our history,” she said. “He is worse than
  Reagan when it comes to his approach to unions,” said Julie Su, who was acting
  labor secretary under Biden. “We saw what Reagan did in the 1980s. That began
  a long decline in unionization. This president wants to make America non-union
  again. He’s certainly trying to make the government non-union again.”
  Shierholz said the “absolute scale of crushing unions” under Trump is “on a
  whole different scale from what we saw under Reagan. Trump is saying it’s
  absolutely open season on union folks. He took an absolute chainsaw to the
  federal workforce. He’s giving the green light to the private sector and local
  government to do the same.” Justin Chen, president of an American Federation
  of Government Employees council representing 8,000 Environmental Protection
  Agency (EPA) workers across the US, is angry that Trump halted collective
  bargaining for EPA employees, voided most of their union contracts and fired
  probationary workers. “Whatever he said about fighting for workers was a
  complete lie,” Chen said. “He treats federal employees with a great deal of
  disdain, not as civil servants valuable to make our government and economy
  run.” Many labor advocates say Trump’s signature policies, including tariffs
  and deportations, are hurting US workers. Trump’s tariffs are pushing up
  prices and slowing economic growth, economists say. Trump’s “big, beautiful”
  tax cut will harm millions of working families by cutting food assistance and
  causing many to lose health coverage. As for Trump’s deportation campaign,
  many workers say it’s undermining their employers’ businesses and forcing them
  to work harder because they have to do the work of their departed co-workers.
  In her annual State of the Unions address, AFL-CIO president Shuler said on
  Wednesday: “The state of working people in this country is they’re under
  attack.” She added: “We want cheaper groceries, and we get tanks on our
  streets. We want more affordable healthcare, and we get 16 million Americans
  about to be kicked off their coverage.” Shuler said unions will hold close to
  1,000 rallies and other events this Labor Day across the US to kick off a year
  of mobilization. Jenny Smith, a home-care worker in Champaign, Illinois, said
  Trump’s plan to end overtime and minimum-wage protections for home-care
  workers shows contempt for struggling, low-wage workers. “Trump doesn’t know
  what it means to go to work day after day to earn a living,” she said. “If you
  take away these wage protections, it will take money out of these workers’
  pockets. The majority of these workers are Black, brown and single mothers.
  You’re taking from their children’s mouths.” Smith voiced dismay that Trump
  hasn’t made good on his promise to reduce prices. “I’m very disappointed that
  prices aren’t going down,” she said. “I just bought a dozen eggs for $6.” She
  added: “I don’t think he cares about us, but he does care about the
  billionaires.” Trump has taken numerous steps that will weaken safety
  protections for workers. He is cutting staffing by 12% at the Occupational
  Safety and Health Administration (Osha). His administration has proposed
  eliminating a requirement for adequate lighting on construction sites. It is
  reducing the fines that small businesses pay for violating safety rules. It
  has proposed blocking the government’s mine-safety district managers from
  ordering upgrades in mine ventilation and safety. It has slowed action on
  Biden’s effort to protect workers from high temperatures. Trump also froze
  enforcement of a Biden-era regulation that protects miners from silicosis, a
  serious lung disease. “Silicosis has become a major killer among coal miners,
  but the Trump administration is trying to make silicosis great again,” said
  David Michaels, a professor of public health at George Washington University
  who headed Osha under Barack Obama. “The Trump administration has taken
  several steps that are devastating to the safety and health of the nation’s
  workers. Osha, which is under-resourced and underpowered, has become
  significantly smaller as a result of the Trump and Doge [Trump’s unofficial
  ‘department of government efficiency’] cuts.” Michaels warned that Trump’s
  cuts to Osha penalties will reduce incentives for companies to ensure safe
  conditions. Administration officials point to the Trump-backed “no tax on
  tips” and “no tax on overtime” as clearly pro-worker. But Yale’s Budget Lab
  notes that only 4% of workers in the bottom half by income are in tipped jobs,
  while almost 40% of tipped workers earn so little they don’t pay federal
  income taxes. Moreover, the no-tax-on-overtime provision will reduce income
  taxes far less than most workers realize. The deduction applies only to the
  “half” in “time-and-a-half” overtime pay. If a worker earns $20 an hour and
  their overtime rate is $30, that worker can deduct only the $10 premium for
  each overtime hour, not the full $30. Shierholz said that if Trump were
  serious about helping workers, “he would raise the minimum wage, make overtime
  pay double pay and do away with the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers. That
  would truly help workers, but that’s not what he’s doing. He’s doing as little
  as possible to help workers, while helping employers.” While Trump says his
  deportations will create job opportunities for US-born workers, Shierholz’s
  economic institute forecasts that Trump’s effort to deport 1 million
  immigrants a year will result in 5.9m lost jobs after four years: 3.3 million
  fewer employed immigrants and 2.6 million fewer employed US-born workers. “If
  you don’t have immigrant roofers and framers, you’re not building houses, and
  that means electricians and plumbers lose their jobs,” Shierholz said. “Plus,
  you lose the consumer spending from those workers.” Corey Mahoney, a
  35-year-old cargo handler at John F Kennedy international airport in New York,
  said Trump’s policies have whipsawed workers at his warehouse. “The tariff
  situation has slowed down work, and many people lost their jobs,” he said.
  When Trump ended protected status for many Venezuelans and other immigrants,
  some of his Venezuelan co-workers left or were deported. “Some of the people I
  was working with tried to come to work, but they weren’t allowed,” he said.
  “We were left with less people, and we had to work twice as hard. It’s
  unfair.” “Trump is in an alternative universe thinking everything is good,”
  Mahoney said. “He doesn’t realize that normal people who are just trying to
  make a living aren’t happy with what he’s doing.”
