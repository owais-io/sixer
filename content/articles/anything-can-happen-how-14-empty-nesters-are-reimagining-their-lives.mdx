  The term “empty nest” first emerged in the late 19th century, gaining traction
  in psychological and sociological discourse by the 1940s. Originally, it
  evoked a singular image: a mother alone in a quiet house, mourning the
  departure of her last child. But the reality, then and now, is far more
  nuanced. While the term was once gendered, today the emotional impact is felt
  across all parents, regardless of role or identity. The empty nest is not a
  fixed state but a mutable one. For some, it arrives with a deep ache, a sense
  of disorientation or loss. For others, it marks a period of renewal, space
  reclaimed, silence embraced, autonomy rediscovered. The nest may stay quiet or
  grow noisy again with boomerang children, ageing parents or new partners. Some
  preserve their homes like time capsules; others transform them entirely,
  reimagining their lives within, claiming room for new identities, desires and
  rhythms. In the United States, there were an estimated 20.9 million empty-nest
  households in 2022, defined, perhaps narrowly, as adults aged 55 and older
  with no children at home and at least two spare bedrooms, according to a
  Zillow housing analysis based on Census Bureau microdata. At the same time,
  18% of adults aged 25–34 were still living in their parents’ homes, the Pew
  Research Center reported in 2023, underscoring the fluidity of modern family
  life. My own experience sparked this project. With three closely aged
  children, my husband and I went from anticipating an empty nest to the
  pandemic’s upheaval, when the children never left or returned soon after.
  These shifts left me wondering how others navigate the same emotional terrain.
  This photo essay explores that in-between space, homes no longer centered on
  children yet not entirely free of their presence. Through interviews and
  intimate portraits, I have documented parents in and around Los Angeles county
  whose nests are empty, partially empty or perpetually in flux. For many, this
  phase is both loss and gain, grief and freedom folded into one. Their stories
  – tender, complex and often contradictory – reveal that “empty” is rarely the
  right word. What emerges instead is a quiet choreography of change, where
  absence and reinvention often share the same space. Staci and Peter Empty
  nesters for 10 months; one child I was a little panicked that she was going to
  be gone and we’d never talk to her. And it’s actually quite the opposite. We
  talk to her three times a day, actually, sometimes more than that. I miss her
  being here physically so I can hug her. But also, I don’t miss that because it
  comes with all the other things – the mess and the chaos. What we didn’t
  anticipate was how hard it would be to lose both our dog and cat soon after
  our daughter left for college – suddenly, the house felt empty of both our
  child and our furry companions. We’re still adjusting. Staci Barry and Debbie
  Empty nesters for five years; one child So much of her life is still around
  here. There’s a lot of horse stuff and stuff that she collected. Barry Barry
  was morose for a long time. He would go down the hallway and stand in front of
  her room. I had a bit of a “yay” moment … As long as I knew she was safe, I
  felt really good. Debbie (pictured in lead image) Amy and Eddie Empty nesters
  for two years; four children It has been an adjustment. I like not having to
  schedule what’s for dinner … Their rooms are as they left them. I take a
  picture of their rooms and show them how their plants are doing, and I will
  alternate their rooms where I take a nap. Eddie It is a mixed bag. It is
  relief … but I also miss the liveliness. I am enjoying daily exercise,
  prioritizing myself, seeing clients but also finally writing. That is
  something I wanted to do my whole life. Amy Tiza and Kevin Empty nesters for
  nine years, blended family; three children We never had a relationship without
  kids. We got married when the kids were eight and nine. We always had kids so
  now we get to figure out, what does our relationship look like without them?
  It was an emotional rollercoaster. On one hand, I had extra time – I no longer
  had to drive here and there, and have her schedule in my head in addition to
  my own. But on the other hand, I felt a loss of purpose. What do I want to do
  now? What am I doing besides working? Who am I? What is my life? What is my
  joy and what are my wants? Tiza Carolina Empty nester for six months; two
  children I am divorced after a long marriage and am not dating anyone. I
  definitely used to be all about my marriage and kids, and I feel like I did so
  much for them that I lost myself. It hasn’t been about me since my 20s so I
  guess I am trying to rediscover myself after all of these years. I definitely
  do enjoy the freedom in not having to worry about someone else. But at the
  same time that gets lonely. Tony Brief empty nester, home now repopulated; two
  children Both kids have been living here for the past couple of years. My
  daughter’s furniture is here, replacing mine. I try to provide support for
  them in everything they do. I love making French toast for them. Most of the
  time there’s no one home, or there is someone home but there is no sign of
  anybody. Sometimes I don’t want anybody in the house and they are here. I
  can’t be myself. It is supposed to be my space. It is supposed to be my time
  now. Allyson and David Empty nesters for one year, home now repopulated; two
  children We converted half of the house, where the boys’ rooms were, into a
  second space to rent out, to have some passive income. Our goal is to have
  passive income so that we can retire. My husband was not initially on board,
  thinking it might be weird having a stranger there. But our older son and his
  girlfriend moved into it, and it worked out well. They pay rent and have a
  totally separate space. Allyson Initially, I felt it was odd to charge my son
  rent to live in his room but I have come around. We want them to have an
  appreciation for earned income. David Sondra Empty nester for 3.5 years; one
  child The biggest change was having the focus of my life be back on me. In
  general, the focus of my life is not me, because I always have my patients and
  I have my ageing parents and [my daughter]. Everyone thought I was going to
  lose my mind. Because they thought she and I were co-dependent and that
  neither of us would be able to survive without the other. And we both did just
  fine. I can’t say I miss her, per se. I overscheduled myself in the beginning
  on purpose just to fill the time, but then I realized I don’t need to do that
  because I am fine. I am OK! Melanie and Albhy Empty nesters (first time more
  than 20 years ago, and again three years ago); three children “Empty nest” is
  a loaded term for most people. For us, it’s just a step in evolution. It is a
  continuum. You may leave; they may go away for a while. They may come back.
  They may get married, you may have grandchildren. They may go off and do
  something for a year while you take care of their grandchild. Anything can
  happen. Albhy Jeannie Empty nester for five months; three children I was
  mostly looking forward to being an empty nester and I felt guilty for thinking
  that I would be happy that my kids had flown the coop, but I was also nervous
  because I did not know what to expect. I’ve got back into cooking. It used to
  be whatever I made had to be something they would eat. Now I can make what I
  want to eat. I am definitely messier when they are not around. I am definitely
  letting loose. I feel less guilty about going out. I’ve been taking care of
  myself and finding my own joy that doesn’t necessarily involve them, but with
  them gone, it has been amplified. Shannon and Nestor Empty nesters for six
  months, home briefly repopulated; two children You take comfort in knowing
  that they’re in a new stage in their lives, charting their own course. Or at
  least I try! A big problem for me has been stepping back and trying not to fix
  issues. I need to let them sort it out. I have to fight the impulse to try and
  fix everything for them and that’s been a challenge. I certainly have felt a
  shift to much more bigger-picture questions about life … When you are in
  parent mode, you’re so invested in the day-to-day activities of your kids, in
  the minutia. So once that’s gone, I certainly found myself pondering a lot of
  bigger questions about life, about what comes after this, and what is beyond
  this life. Nestor Wendy and John Empty nesters for four years; one child We
  argue less as a couple when it’s just the two of us. For some reason the
  tension is lower without a child around, even if the child’s an angel – they
  are scrutinizing your relationship with your partner and those kinds of
  things. John I was always the “on-call person”, and after she left, I started
  a whole new career. I kind of feel like I’m free. But at the drop of a hat I
  would get on a plane and go to save her. Wendy Interviews have been condensed
  and edited for clarity. Rohina Hoffman is an Indian-American fine art
