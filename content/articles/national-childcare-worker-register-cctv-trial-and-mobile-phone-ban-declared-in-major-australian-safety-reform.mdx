  Childcare workers will be put on a national register in a sweeping safety
  overhaul of the sector that includes a CCTV trial at hundreds of centres,
  mobile phone bans and mandatory staff training. The commonwealth will put
  $189m towards the reforms and work will begin immediately. Federal, state and
  territory education ministers met in Sydney on Friday and agreed to major
  changes in the childcare and early education sectors. The federal education
  minister, Jason Clare, said the CCTV trial will begin in October or November
  and run at 300 centres across the country. The trial will consider who holds
  the data and how the data is stored. The safety training regime for childcare
  employees will be rolled out early next year. “Is it everything that we need
  to do? No, of course it’s not, but it’s the next thing that we must do,” Clare
  said at a press conference. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Governments have
  been under immense pressure after a series of horrific allegations of abuse in
  childcare settings were uncovered in recent months. Clare said all levels of
  government and industry needed to improve standards. “Over the course of the
  last few weeks, we have made some changes to keep our kids safe but not enough
  and not fast enough,” the minister said. “We have all got to step up here if
  we are serious about keeping our kids safe. That means the Australian
  government stepping up, states and territories stepping up, and regulators
  stepping up, and it means the people who run our centres stepping up” Concerns
  have been raised on how the system can catch red flag behaviour. Clare said
  the new register will be rolled out in stages in February 2026 by the
  Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority. He said the system
  would monitor and spot workers moving between centres and eventually embed
  information from working with children checks. But Clare admitted it would not
  be a magic bullet. “Over time, we want to build all of that information into
  [the register] so we can see employment history, so we can have the
  information that’s needed to identify red flags to tell us that someone’s
  moving quickly from centre to centre to centre, to be able to identify that
  somebody … might be up to no good.” He said none of it was a “guarantee” of
  safety. “But it is an essential component in what we need to do if we’re going
  to keep our children safe.” The ministers also agreed for commonwealth
  officers to complete an extra 1,600 spot visits – something that had been
  flagged by the government. The commonwealth has conceded reforms have been too
  slow, with some recommendations to improve childcare safety dating back to the
  royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse in 2015.
  The federal government recently named 37 childcare centres that were not
  meeting standards, after legislation was passed in July. Clare said those
  centres will risk losing access to the childcare care subsidy. “If taxpayers’
  money will be invested to operate in early education and care centre, we
  expect them to meet the standards and keep our kids safe. Fundamentally, that
  is what the legislation is all about – 37 centres on notice already. There are
  more to come.” On Wednesday, Victoria released the findings of a snap review
  by the former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill and senior Victorian
  bureaucrat Pam White. It made 22 recommendations, all accepted by the state
  government, but half are directed at the federal government. “Where there are
  vulnerable systems and vulnerable people, there is indeed risk. And so the
  more we can build national systems that will keep children safe, both across
  borders and between sectors that work with children, that is critical,” the
  Victorian minister for children, Lizzie Blandthorn, said.
