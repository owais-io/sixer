  In August, Paris is uncharacteristically quiet as hordes of residents scatter
  to the country’s beaches and coasts for a yearly month of vacation. Businesses
  close and the city nearly grinds to a halt. Among those who remain, there is
  an eternal, quintessentially Parisian quest: hunting for a balmy terrasse
  bathed in sunlight for an evening apéritif. Finding the perfect seat on the
  pavement outside a cafe may be a matter of a chance stroll or a timely text
  from a friend. This summer, though, a digital solution has gained popularity
  in an extremely French instance of the old Apple slogan “there’s an app for
  that”: Jveuxdusoleil, an app that tracks the sun’s movement through the city’s
  maze of buildings to pinpoint exactly where you can claim a sunny spot on a
  terrace for your coffee. It arrives at a precarious moment for this
  particularly Parisian pursuit. Jean-Charles Levenne created Jveuxdusoleil (“I
  want sun”) in 2020 as a side project in an effort to teach himself app
  development and solve a personal problem: finding shade during hot days as
  well as sunny spots for the Parisian ritual of post-work drinks. Using
  sun-positioning algorithms and building-height data from the open-source map
  platform OpenStreetMap, Levenne’s app displays sunny terraces, while darkened
  ones disappear. Users can also request new spots through the app or note when
  it is not accurate (a tree casting a previously unaccounted for shadow, for
  example), making it a constantly evolving, community-driven tool. While the
  technology is working in other cities, most of the terraces on the app are
  located in Paris, where Levenne says it is particularly useful. “This app is
  working worldwide but it has originally been focused on Paris because there is
  more need than in other French cities,” he said. “With narrow streets and tall
  buildings, it’s not always easy to find a sunny spot.” Terraces function as
  observation posts from which to view Paris – chairs are often positioned on
  either side of the small bistro tables, facing the street rather than each
  other and allowing diners to observe the world passing by. With France’s lack
  of tipping culture, there is less pressure to quickly turn over tables to make
  more profit. One could order a single cup of espresso for less than €2 and
  stay for hours – making the terrace something of a second living room for
  Parisians. Pierrick Bourgault, a photographer and journalist who has written
  about 20 books and released a documentary about bistro culture in France, said
  terraces in Paris offer one of the most authentic windows into the city. “The
  terrace is emblematic of a certain art de vivre [art of living], as we say in
  France – a place where all kinds of people meet,” Bourgault said. “You’re not
  alone in an enclosed space. It’s a bit like [being in] the street, with one
  foot inside and one foot outside. You’re immersed in the city, and the
  spectacle of life.” In search of sun after the darkest winter in decades
  Jveuxdusoleil’s user base has climbed steadily in the years since its launch –
  with more than 1,300 active users in the week preceding my interview with
  Levenne, who has departed the tech world and called me from a yacht he now
  captains in the Balearic islands off the coast of Spain. App usage spikes in
  the spring, when Parisians are desperate for sunlight after the notoriously
  dreary winter months. This year, Jveuxdusoleil saw a peak of almost 20,000
  visitors in just one week in early March after France experienced the darkest
  year in 30 years in 2024. Paris in particular endured multiple stretches of
  nearly a week at a time without a single ray of sunshine during the winter
  months. Jveuxdusoleil is entirely a passion project, and Levenne makes no
  profit from it. “In fact, it costs me money to host the servers,” he said. A
  Paris-based photographer I spoke with, who uses the app both to find sunny
  streets for shooting and terraces to enjoy drinks with friends, said the
  uncomplicated nature of Jveuxdusoleil is part of its appeal. Its features are
  minimal: with just one slider that determines time and sunlight, it positions
  itself as a kind of anti-everything app. Can an app revive declining terrasse
  culture? While usership of Jveuxdusoleil is not necessarily widespread – many
  young French people I spoke with on the terraces of Paris had never heard of
  the app – its existence indicates a technological embrace of bistro culture in
  France at a crucial time. The number of bistros in France has declined from
  500,000 in 1900 to fewer than 40,000 today, according to an official French
  heritage inventory document submitted in May 2024. The document also stated
  that in Paris the number of bistros has declined from 5,000-6,000 in the
  1970s-80s to just over 1,000 today. A coalition of French bistro owners
  successfully secured national recognition in September 2024. They have
  similarly been campaigning since 2018 for Unesco World Heritage status for
  their establishments. Bourgault attributes this “massacre”, which has
  decreased the density of bistros in France over the last century from one cafe
  per 100 inhabitants to one per 2,000, to a barrage of continuing threats. The
  rise of automobiles and highways has diverted traffic from such establishments
  across the country, while television, smartphones and digital communications
  have replaced the need to meet friends at the local terrace. The report by
  bistro owners likewise cites globalization and changing consumer preferences
  as risks to bistro culture. A 1941 law prohibits new cafe creation and only
  allows takeovers of existing licenses, keeping the number of bistros
  relatively stagnant while soaring real estate prices, particularly in Paris,
  have made both running and patronizing these establishments less financially
  viable. French commentators have long lamented the “Americanisation of Paris”,
  with some noting that, as more traditional bistros close, McDonald’s is
  spreading quickly across France and becoming a de facto meeting place for many
  young people. Bourgault said the rise of technology has contributed to the
  decline of bistros; people can order delivery on their phones, and when they
  do go out they often stay glued to their devices instead of chatting with
  strangers at the comptoir. It’s ironic then, he noted, that an app could in
  fact strengthen the bistro culture of Paris. “With its geographical
  visualization, the app situates you in the concrete world – it reminds us that
  we’re on earth, it reminds us that there’s a sun that moves, the earth that
  turns,” he said. “When we meet friends at a bistro for a drink, we aren’t
  meeting in the cloud – we are meeting in a cafe with distinct personality,
  characters and decor,” he added. “We know we are not two artificial
  intelligences [in the process] of exchanging digital protocols. We talk to
  each other, and without a shadow of a doubt, we know it is real.”
