  Well this has been quite some day of news. Where to begin this recap? The
  Albanese government will invest $30m to lift the number of electrical and
  construction teachers in trade skills teaching. An MP with an autistic
  daughter revealed fears over NDIS changes. New environment reforms will be put
  to parliament “this side of Christmas”, Murray Watt said. Australia Post
  suspended parcel deliveries to the US due to the Trump administration’s
  tariffs. Coles posted a $1bn net profit. A Liberal senator condemned
  “unacceptable” targeting of Indian Australians ahead of anti-immigration
  protest. Penny Wong said Israel’s attack on a Gaza hospital was “horrific”. A
  former Pentagon official urged Australia not to abandon the Aukus pact. Donald
  Trump vowed fresh tariffs on countries pursuing digital services taxes against
  US tech giants. Australian of the Year Neale Daniher was given a standing
  ovation as question time began. The PM revealed that Asio had found that Iran
  directed at least two antisemitic attacks on Australian soil. Asked about
  actions taken against Iran, Albanese in question time said Iran orchestrated
  “extraordinary and dangerous acts” in Australia in a bid to sow discord. Tony
  Burke announced the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps would be listed as a
  terrorist organisation. Jewish leader said the community’s ‘worst fears’ were
  confirmed. Israel praised Australia for its ‘principled stand’ on Iranian
  regime. Take care. We’ll be back tomorrow. We’ve got a question on gambling
  advertising Yes or no, will the federal government finally ban gambling ads,
  as was recommended by a parliamentary committee chaired by the late Peta
  Murphy and last year’s “rapid review” into measures to prevent violence
  against women? Albanese’s response? We don’t make policy on the run. When
  reminded of the two reviews and asked what’s stopping the government from
  acting on the recommendations, Albanese said: What’s in our mind is the
  practicalities of whether people just go offshore, then there’s no revenue at
  all. They engage in gambling with no revenue coming back at all. And it
  doesn’t solve the problem. Could grandparents and nannies access the childcare
  subsidy? Shifting topic again, Albanese is asked if the federal government
  would consider the idea of allowing grandparents and nannies to access the
  childcare subsidy. The idea has been raised in the past and Albanese is
  careful not to dismiss it out of hand. But the prime minister stresses it
  would be a “very big” (and expensive) change to the system. I understand where
  people are coming from with that, and we certainly respect choice and families
  are diverse and different, and they’ll choose different ways. But that would
  be a very big impost on the commonwealth, on the taxpayer. Someone has to pay
  for it, and it would change the dynamic, I think, of the way that families
  operate, and the implications behind that could be taken in quite a few other
  directions as well. Albanese says ‘enormous wealth’ created from resources
  when asked about tax changes Switching to an entirely different topic, the PM
  is asked about the tax imposed on offshore gas producers known as the
  petroleum resource rent tax (or PRRT). Critics have long claimed the PRRT
  doesn’t raise enough revenue for taxpayers. Albanese notes the government made
  changes to the PRRT two years ago before dismissing the need for a
  Norwegian-style sovereign wealth fund. There is enormous wealth created from
  our resources sector. I understand that the shortcut is that some people would
  like those resources to not exist - that’s the truth. The argument for some of
  those is about PRRT, but it’s really about why don’t you stop those
  industries. ‘It is difficult to see how we are a major player in the Middle
  East’ Back to the PM’s Instagram appearance – next up are a couple of
  questions about sanctions on Israel amid its war in Gaza. Albanese is asked if
  Australia will attempt to lobby the US to pressure Israel, given global
  efforts thus far appear to be having a “fairly limited effect” on the actions
  of the Netanyahu government. It’s not up to us to put pressure on the United
  States. It is up to us to state what Australia’s position is very clearly. And
  Australia’s position has been to call for ceasefire, to call for the release
  of hostages, to call for a two-state solution in the long term, and to engage
  constructively with that the right of Israel to continue to exist with
  security and safety, but also the right of Palestinians to have their
  legitimate aspirations for their own state to be realised. When pressed on the
  public’s “frustration” with the apparent ineffectiveness of statements,
  Albanese said: As I’ve said, as much as people would like to think that
  somehow the Australian government can change the actions of the Israeli
  government, it is difficult to see how we are a major player in the Middle
  East. The official account of the embassy of Israel in Australia has shared a
  statement on X in response to today’s revelations: For decades, the Iranian
  regime has posed a threat to Israelis and Jewish communities around the world.
  Today, it became clear that this threat has reached Australian soil. The
  international community can no longer be complacent. Australia has taken a
  principled stand, others should consider following suit. Labor MP says Iran’s
  involvement in antisemitic attacks is ‘shocking’ and ‘a new frontier’ Josh
  Burns, the federal member for Macnamara, said the announcement regarding the
  attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue being directed by Iran, was “shocking and
  quite frightening” for the Jewish community. Finding out it was not some local
  actor but being a foreign government is “a new frontier”, he said. He also
  acknowledged the emotions for the Iranian community today: I want to take this
  opportunity also to say that the Iranian Australian community are a beautiful
  community. They also deeply understand what the Iranian regime is capable of
  and I stand in solidarity with the Iranian Australians. This is not about the
  proud Persian people. This is about a regime that is, frankly, attacking
  Australian citizens and one that has sponsored terrorism and one whose
  actionings need to be combatted strongly. In something a little bit different,
  Anthony Albanese is participating in a Q&amp;A on the ABC’s Instagram account.
  The public broadcaster invited punters to submit questions to the PM, who is
  answering a selection of them live on the social media platform. Before
  getting to audience questions, Albanese is asked if local authorities worked
  with other countries to establish Iran’s involvement in orchestrating at least
  two antisemitic attacks in Australia. The prime minister said: No, it was
  primarily Asio’s investigation and Asio came to this determination, and they
  advised us yesterday morning. Albanese is asked if details about further cases
  of Iran involvement in antisemitic attacks, beyond the two instances disclosed
  on Tuesday, would be revealed. What we want to do is to make sure that
  anything that we say publicly doesn’t interfere with any of the
  investigations, and so we will release more information when it’s appropriate
  going forward. Labor has no plans to change news media bargaining code despite
  Trump threats Federal Labor isn’t changing its mind on plans for the news
  media bargaining code, despite threats today from US president Donald Trump of
  tough new tariffs. Trump on Tuesday said he will impose tariffs and chip
  export restrictions on countries pursuing digital services taxes against big
  American technology companies. He said the US and tech platforms were not the
  “piggy bank” or “doormat” of the world. “Show respect to America and our
  amazing Tech Companies or, consider the consequences,” he wrote on social
  media. The assistant treasurer, Daniel Mulino, tells Guardian Australia there
  is no change to the government’s approach. Labor’s news media bargaining
  incentive will be a levy on digital platforms who have not renewed or
  initiated deals with news publishers to pay for content. A spokesperson said:
  The government has been clear about the plans for the News Bargaining
  Incentive and we have been consulting with stakeholders from both media and
  digital platforms to ensure the best outcomes for Australia. Turnbull says
  Palestinians ‘deserve a state of their own’ but there are ‘good reasons’ not
  to recognise statehood Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has also backed
  the government’s moves regarding Iran today. Appearing on the ABC’s Afternoon
  Briefing, Turnbull was also asked about whether Australia’s pledge to
  recognise Palestinian statehood at the UN is the right call: Well, look, it’s
  not a call that my government took and there are very good arguments for not
  recognising Palestine as a state, regardless of what you think about the cause
  of the Palestinians, and they clearly do deserve a state of their own and they
  do deserve to be protected from the violence that they’re suffering from at
  the moment. But the problem with Palestine is that it isn’t in control of its
  borders. It’s effectively occupied territory, so you can make a lawyer’s
  argument, and a very good one, for not recognising it as a state. I think
  countries that have done so – and most countries in the world have done so and
  now Australia is joining them – are doing so as a sign of solidarity for the
  Palestinian people and a sign of saying to them and to the world, we believe
  that you are entitled to have a state of your own. We believe in the two-state
  solution. You can say it’s a gesture. You can say it’s political, but it’s an
  approach, a viewpoint, a position that has been taken by the overwhelming
  majority of countries represented in the United Nations. Hastie says Coalition
  stands ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with Labor on Iran developments Shadow home
  affairs minister Andrew Hastie has praised the government’s response to the
  Iran news. He’s told ABC Afternoon Briefing that “we stand with the government
  on this shoulder to shoulder”. Hastie said he was briefed by Penny Wong and
  Tony Burke just before question time. Melbourne rabbi says Jewish community
  ‘reeling’ but ‘united’ Melbourne Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann shared his reaction to
  the government’s announcement that the attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue
  was directed by Iran. He told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: It’s shocking. The
  community is absolutely reeling. But there’s also a sense of an ‘I told you
  so’ moment overcoming the community. The community has felt under attack from
  two days after October 7, 2023, and we’ve been begging government for more
  support. In some ways, it has come. In other ways it hasn’t. Kaltman said his
  community “haven’t felt safe but we’ve stayed united”. “To now be told that
  it’s a foreign government involved in attacking Jewish Australians is horrific
  news.” ‘It’s absolutely terrifying’ Ryvchin said he spoke to the owners of
  Lewis’ Continental Kitchen – the business that was targeted in one of the two
  incidents the government said was directed by Iran: They were beside
  themselves. On one level, it brings closure, I suppose, and greater clarity as
  to who was responsible and why. But knowing that a foreign regime who
  committed terror attacks throughout the world is targeting Australian Jews –
  it’s absolutely terrifying. And there are so many layers to this. We’ve seen
  the involvement of organised crime. So to have so many lethal elements
  involved, it really has caused further terror in the community, no doubt. The
  British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert – who was held for 804 days
  by the Revolutionary Guards, most of it in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison –
  said the Iranian embassy in Canberra had long played a “sinister role in
  sponsoring the surveillance of dissidents here in Australia”. For years now
  the Iranian-Australian community and other victims of the IRGC, including
  myself, have been literally screaming at rallies, to our local MPs, in
  parliamentary consultations and in reports to the national security hotline
  that Iranian agents are operating brazenly and with few consequences here on
  Australian soil. It’s been a big news day. Here’s a quick catchup on the news
  about Iran and antisemitic attacks: Australia’s domestic intelligence agency
  Asio says it has intelligence that Iran directed at least two major
  antisemitic attacks in Australia in 2024: Lewis’ Continental Kitchen in Sydney
  on 20 October, and the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on 6 December. Asio
  believes there are links between the alleged crimes and “commanders in Iran’s
  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC.” Director general Mike Burgess
  claimed the IRGC “used a complex web of proxies to hide its involvement”, but
  that criminals in Australia were paid to carry out these attacks. Burgess
  claimed IRGC officials were “directing through a series of cut-outs, people in
  Australia to undertake the crimes”. The government will legislate to list the
  IRGC as a terrorist organisation, Anthony Albanese said. Asio believes at
  least two, and potentially more, of the antisemitic attacks were directed by
  Iran, with the aim of “messing with social cohesion in Australia”. Iran’s
  ambassador to Australia has been expelled, and will have seven days to leave
  the country along with three other Iranian officials. However Burgess said the
  Iranian embassy was not involved in the attacks, nor any Iranian diplomats in
  Australia. Australia has withdrawn its ambassador in Iran, and suspended
  operations of our embassy there; Australian diplomats are now safe in a third
  country, Albanese said. Australians have long been urged not to travel to
  Iran, and the government has repeated those warnings, recommending Australians
  leave Iran now if it is safe to do so. Jewish leader says attacks ‘sent terror
  through our community’ Ryvchin went on, thanking the government for the
  measures it has taken since the announcement: These attacks … deliberately
  targeted the Jewish community, destroyed a sacred house of worship, caused
  millions of dollars of damage and sent terror through our community. For many
  years, we have warned of the threat posed by the Iranian regime. This is a
  regime that not only subjugates its own people and war in the Middle East
  using its proxies, it has the capability and willingness to project terror
  throughout the world. The entity responsible for this attack is the Islamic
  Revolutionary Guard Corp and it is therefore entirely appropriate that our
  government has decided to designate them as a terrorist organisation in
  addition to expelling the Iranian ambassador. Two measures that we thank and
  commend the Australian government, and that we have long advocated for as
  well. Alex Ryvchin, the co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry,
  says the government’s announcement that two antisemitic attacks were
  orchestrated by the Iranian regime “confirms our community’s worst fears”. Two
  of these attacks were plotted and orchestrated by a foreign entity operating
  on Australian soil. The Australian Jewish community is foremost deeply
  grateful to the men and women of the AFP, Asio and state police for keeping us
  safe. For their steel-minded commitment to pursuing these people, solving
  these crime and bringing the perpetrators to justice. These attacks instigated
  by the Iranian regime are an attack on our nation and our sovereignty, and as
  Australians, we are outraged by them. Hello and let’s jump straight into it.
  Alex Ryvchin, from the executive council of Australian Jewry, has been
  speaking in Sydney in response to today’s news. Thanks all for joining me on
  the blog today. I’ll leave you with the lovely Natasha May. I’ll see you here
  bright and early tomorrow. Tl;dr here’s what happened in QT Question time
  started on the revelations of Asio finding that Iran directed antisemitic
  attacks on Australian soil. The Coalition then moved on to tax questions,
  trying to get the government to rule out tax changes to housing, family trusts
  and farms. The government wouldn’t bite, and attacked the Coalition on its own
  policy promises at the last election. Independent MP Allegra Spender asked the
  prime minister if the government will work with the Jewish community to keep
  them safe. The PM says he spoke to Jewish leaders earlier today before the
  press conference, and that the government has rolled out funding for security
  for schools and community groups – but he doesn’t foreshadow any further
  funding. Greens back decision to expel Iranian ambassador and list IRGC as
  terror group The Greens have backed the federal government’s decision to expel
  the Iranian ambassador and list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a
  terrorist organisation after revelations of Iran’s role in orchestrating at
  least two antisemitic attacks in Australia. The Greens defence and foreign
  affairs spokesman, David Shoebridge, said the party had been calling for the
  listing of the IRGC for more than 12 months. Shoebridge said: We have heard
  from the (Iranian) diaspora community here that they do feel a sense of
  transnational repression. They felt that the Iranian regime is making them
  less safe in their communities. It is is deeply unfortunate that it’s taken
  this most recent incident for the government to come forward with that action,
  but in solidarity with the Iranian diaspora and acknowledging the vile nature
  of those antisemitic attacks, we again say to the government, we will assist
  in that pathway through the Senate for legislation to permit the listing of
  the IRGC. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has made a statement to
  question time, confirming she has been briefed by the prime minister regarding
  the Iranian government being behind the attack at the the Adass Israel
  Synagogue in Melbourne last year. She told the chamber the announcement had
  “extraordinary implications” from Victoria’s national security. For the first
  time since World War II, the Australian government has expelled an ambassador,
  and we support this decision without reservation, just as we have supported
  the joint investigation every step of the way. I’ll start by saying that this
  is an ongoing investigation, and there are still some facts that we don’t
  know, but here’s what we do know. In December last year, terrorism shattered
  the peace in Melbourne and destroyed a synagogue built by Holocaust survivors.
  The target of this act of terror was Victoria’s Jewish community. I visited
  Adass Israel Synagogue twice in the days after that attack, I will never
  forget the smell of burnt books. I will never forget the burns on their hands,
  and I will never forget thinking just how close this came to being a mass
  casualty event. My anger at the perpetrators of this act of terror will never,
  ever subside. Allan says she spoke to Benjamin Klein from the the synagogue
  earlier today and expressed “the love and support of all Victorians”. Speaker,
  the fear the Jewish community are feeling after this news is real and intense.
  And let me say this, when you inflict hurt and pain on one, you inflict it on
  all. This attack was not just an attack on Victoria’s Jewish community, it was
  an attack on all Victorians. And I say this to the Jewish community, your
  safety is our safety. We stand with you. We stand with your right to pray in
  peace, your right to live in this state in safety. Bowen: ‘One Coalition, and
  many, many ways of killing net zero’ The government has pounced on the growing
  disunity over climate and net zero in the Coalition party room. Chris Bowen
  ends question time with a dixer on Labor’s “clear and consistent” climate and
  energy policy. Bowen lists a few of the government’s policies and then digs
  into the opposition: What we have is two parties, one Coalition, and many,
  many ways of killing net zero. All that leads to net zero plan for the future
  of Australia, net zero plan for Australia’s regions who are relying on the
  Australian government to deal with the challenges of climate change and the
  impacts of drought and flood. We’ll probably be hearing those lines for a
  while. Will Australia update its plastics policies? Zali Steggall gets the
  next crossbench question, and asks about plastic pollution. She says
  Australians are one of the world’s largest users of single-use plastic, and
  asks whether the government will update our plastics plan when negotiations
  globally aren’t reaching a consensus. Tony Burke takes the question,
  representing the environment minister and says Australia has played a key role
  in negotiations for a plastics treaty. He also says the government has
  delivered more than $1bn with state and territory governments and industries
  to boost recycling. But he doesn’t give a clear answer on whether Australia’s
  plastics policy will be updated. We’re fighting on the international stage for
  binding treaty to end plastic pollution by 2040. All members are concerned
  about this … The government is committed to being part of that international
  action. ‘Get a clue’: housing minister hits back at ‘nonsensical’ question
  about taxing spare bedrooms Back to QT, the Liberal MP Ben Small asks housing
  minister Clare O’Neil whether the government will tax spare bedrooms. O’Neil
  is pretty scathing and says the opposition is living in a “bizarre fantasy
  land”.She then also takes a stab at the shadow housing minister, Andrew Bragg
  (who sits in the Senate). I heard these questions are getting asked over at
  the other place [Senate] today and I thought the shadow Housing Minister has
  not had his Weet-Bix for breakfast this morning, I do not know what he is
  going on about. Small starts arguing back and Milton Dick tells him to pipe
  down. So O’Neil continues The very last people that Australians should listen
  to when it comes to housing policy are those who sit opposite. Remember for
  almost a decade they sat on these benches and did nothing about a housing
  crisis building before their very eyes. They then spent three years being
  housing hypocrites… now they’re asking nonsensical questions about policies
  that don’t even exist. Get a clue. Video – Australia expels Iranian ambassador
  over evidence Iran directed antisemitic attacks Jumping out of question time
  for a moment – you can watch some of that earlier press conference with the
  prime minister and Asio director general Mike Burgess below. To recap, Anthony
  Albanese revealed Asio suspects Iran directed two antisemitic attacks on
  Australian soil. The IRGC will soon be listed as a terrorist organisation.
  Foreign minister Penny Wong confirmed Iran’s ambassador and other embassy
  officials had been asked to leave Australia within seven days. Burgess said
  the embassy was not involved in the attacks. Albanese says government has
  boosted security for Jewish communities Allegra Spender, the independent MP
  for Wentworth, represents the area where the antisemitic attack occurred on
  Lewis’ Continental Kitchen in Sydney. Spender says the security concerns of
  her community and the Jewish community are real and justified and asks if the
  government will work with the community to keep them safe. Albanese says the
  government informed Jewish community leaders of the revelations before the
  press conference earlier this afternoon. He says the government has increased
  security arrangements for the Jewish community, and will continue to work with
  them. What we certainly can have control over here is making sure that we do
  not bring conflict here, that we keep social cohesion. We have a range of
  programs including increased security arrangements around schools, around
  synagogues. The increased support that we have put forward will continue to
  have dialogue with the community and to work with them in order to ensure that
  like other Australians, every Australian should feel safe and yesterday, I
  spoke with the Australian union of Jewish students… the Australian way is to
  respect each other, regardless of people’s faith, regardless of their origin
  and to engage in constructive dialogue about issues not to engage in the sort
  of activity which we have seen. Family farms in focus Daniel Mulino gets
  another question, this time from the Nationals MP Anne Webster, who asks
  whether the government will make any changes to the tax treatment of family
  farms. Mulino says the question is in contrast to comments from the shadow
  treasurer, Ted O’Brien, who he says said that tax policy ideas shouldn’t be
  taken off the table. The shadow treasurer made some interesting comments in
  the lead-up to the roundtable, where he said, let’s be fair dinkum here, we
  shouldn’t be taking anything off the table. What I can stress again is that we
  took a range of tax policies to the last election, implementing those tax
  policies is our priority, that remains our priority. He won’t explicitly
  address the question, and say whether tax treatment will change for family
  farms. ‘We have not changed any of our positions on tax’ I’m sensing more of a
  theme here … Kevin Hogan, the deputy Nationals leader, is up next and asks
  whether the assistant treasurer will rule out tax changes to family trusts.
  Daniel Mulino stands up and says the the economic roundtable was an “important
  forum” and says government has not changed its position on tax. We have not
  changed any of our positions on tax. We have clear tax policy that we look to
  the last election. Hogan tries to make a point of order, but Mulino sits down
  and says he’s finished his answer. ‘I missed the question. I just heard the
  sledge’ Sussan Ley is back up, and is asking again whether the government is
  going to hike up taxes, with the treasurer having said he’s “open minded” to
  tax changes. She tries to get a bit quippy: Can the prime minister confirm
  that having successfully eliminated the member for Chifley and Isaacs from
  cabinet, the treasurer is now working on eliminating Australian savings with a
  fresh round of taxes. A bit of context here – she’s referring to Ed Husic and
  Mark Dreyfus who were booted from the cabinet after the election. So Albanese
  immediately seizes on the talk of division. Credit where credit is due. It
  takes guts to talk about division in the party room from people who have just
  come from a room over there … the leader of the Liberal party in the Senate …
  led the charge to abolish net zero in the party room today ... they are all
  over the shop, Mr Speaker. Unsurprisingly the opposition tries to stop the PM
  attacking the Coalition and says Albanese is “obsessed” with the opposition.
  Milton Dick tells the PM, now that he’s had his preamble, to get to the point.
  Albanese doesn’t. He says: I missed the question. I just heard the sledge …
  it’s hard to follow the plots over there, the Liberals fighting each other,
  the Nationals fighting each other, Liberals fighting the Nationals. Aged care
  minister asked about home care packages To the crossbench, Rebekha Sharkie
  asks the aged care minister about the delay in aged care home packages. She
  says there are now more than 100,000 older Australians on the waiting list for
  home care packages. Older Australians are dying while waiting for aged care.
  What justification does the government have for delaying the promised home
  care packages from July to November this year? Sam Rae, the aged care
  minister, says the government is preparing to implement the new aged care act
  on 1 November, which is when the new home care packages will come online. As
  our population ages, we have seen demand for in-home care grow very, very
  fast. There are now more than 300,000 people accessing home care packages
  today, compared to just 150,000 people back in 2020. The brief deferral of the
  commencement of the new aged care act is to ensure that programs like support
  at home are ready for older Australians and their families. The Labor
  government continues to deliver more care for more Australians, and we have
  given aged care providers more time to prepare their clients, support their
  workers and get their systems ready for these historic changes. Rae says that
  there will be an additional 80,000 home care packages that will come online in
  the first 12 months from 1 November. Remember the roundtable? Sussan Ley is
  back at the mic, and we’re going back to the “government’s three day talk
  fest” (i.e the economic roundtable). She asks whether the PM is aware of any
  work the treasurer has commissioned on new housing taxes, a new death tax,
  wealth tax, tradie tax, or levies on Australian businesses. The PM says the
  opposition “snuck out” its costings before the last election which revealed “a
  $75bn higher figure in personal income taxes.” Spoiler alert, we don’t get
  very far before the opposition’s manager of business, Alex Hawke stands up.
  (There’s a bit of back and forth here, Hawke says he’s being heckled, while
  Milton Dick tells him to get to his point of order or risk getting kicked
  out). The point of order is on relevance but Dick says says Albanese is being
  relevant because it was a broad question. I’m being directly relevant to what
  I was asked about, which was policies from non-government members raised last
  week. And he adds that while Hawke may have said he didn’t want to be at the
  economic roundtable, he should talk to Ted O’Brien, who did. We saw the
  manager of opposition business just say he didn’t want to go to the
  roundtable. Well, talk to the bloke next to you. He was there. He was there.
  He got an invite. And he was keen, Mr Speaker. He even came to drinks at the
  Lodge and he was very welcome. Tony Burke says the government will change the
  criminal code to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist
  organisation. In the first dixer, Burke, the home affairs minister, says the
  existing criminal code was designed decades ago, to “deal with different
  threats to what we’re now facing”. Burke says these attacks were aimed at
  creating fear and eroding social cohesion. This is an unprecedented attack on
  our society. It is aimed at creating fear. It’s stoking internal divisions and
  eroding our social cohesion. And while after the attacks it was described in
  the media that no-one was injured, that’s true, but people were harmed. The
  people who are part of that community at the Adass Israel synagogue were
  harmed. The owners of the Lewis continental kitchen and all their customers
  were harmed. The local communities around were harmed, the Jewish community
  was harmed, and we as a nation were harmed. There is antisemitism in
  Australia, it is real, it is ugly, it is debilitating. He says the blame must
  not fall on Australians of Iranian descent. We don’t take the expulsion
  lightly, PM says Albanese says this is the “most serious response” any
  Australian government has given. We don’t expel an ambassador lightly because
  of the consequences of that which aren’t obviously all upside. But we do think
  that it is an appropriate response given the extraordinary behaviour and the
  direct link they’ve been able to draw through a direct chain to individuals
  and to the IRGC. On indulgence, Sussan Ley says the Coalition and government
  are “entirely united” on the measures announced today. We are all disgusted to
  learn of the serious and chilling foreign interference which has been
  perpetrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran on Australian soil. These acts of
  egregious foreign interference are brazen attempts to cleaver apart our social
  cohesion, to turn neighbour against neighbour and Australian against
  Australian. I therefore want to make it abundantly clear from the opposition,
  while we sit opposite the government in this chamber, we’re entirely united on
  the measures announced today Moving on to questions, Sussan Ley asks Anthony
  Albanese about the Iranian ambassador’s expulsion and listing of the Islamic
  Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. She says the
  Coalition has previously called for these actions, and supports them. Albanese
  says Australians have witnessed a number of “appalling antisemitic attacks”
  against the Jewish community, and recaps Asio’s latest findings. Iran has
  sought to disguise its involvement through the use of criminal elements being
  paid here in Australia. Asio assesses that apart from these two attacks, it is
  likely there are more as well. These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of
  aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil. They were
  attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community.
  Albanese says the embassy staff in Tehran were evacuated to a third country
  safely before the revelations by Asio were made public. The actions of my
  government send a very clear message to nations like Iran, who seek to
  interfere in our country, that your aggression will not be tolerated. Albanese
  also says the government has briefed the premiers of Victoria and NSW, and
  also spoke with Allegra Spender, the federal member for Wentworth, where one
  of the two attacks took place. It’s question time Parliamentarians have filed
  through to their chambers, but before questions begin, Anthony Albanese is
  giving a shoutout to 2025 Australian of the Year, Neale Daniher. What you have
  done is truly extraordinary. Through fighting MND, those iconic beanies and
  the famous Big Freeze slide on the King’s Birthday at the ‘G, $117m has been
  raised to fund research into a cure. I know this whole parliament is proud to
  support those efforts as governments from both sides have over many years.
  Daniher is in the House, and receives a standing ovation. The opposition
  leader, Sussan Ley, joins, celebrating the work Daniher has done to raise
  awareness and money to fight motor neurone disease. Coalition environment
  spokesperson says Labor failing to live up to EPBC Act reform commitments The
  Coalition environment spokesperson, Angie Bell, says her door is open to the
  government on its environmental reforms, accusing Labor of failing to live up
  to its commitments. “This government has had plenty of time to decide to
  update the EPBC Act and reform it, and it has failed,” she told a doorstop in
  Parliament House earlier. What I will also say, and I have said on record, is
  that my door is absolutely open to the minister in terms of detail around what
  he intends to do with the reform that is under way. I want to make sure that
  stakeholders are thoroughly engaged during this process, and I would love to
  meet again with the Minister. Labor minister Murray Watt said the government
  wanted to pass the bill by the end of this year, after efforts stalled and the
  government scrapped its plans for environmental reform in its first term. Bell
  says the Coalition wants to talk, but hasn’t heard details of the new bill. I
  met with [Watt] once to discuss this moving forward, but let’s see what the
  government brings forward in terms of what they consider will be acceptable to
  all the stakeholders. We really want to work with the government on this
  because it’s too important to get this reform wrong. It is well overdue, and
  the government has had time on its hands to actually reform this act … but we
  don’t know the detail. We haven’t heard the details. We haven’t been asked for
  another meeting on the details, so I will scrutinise very closely what the
  government brings forward when they do that. Israeli embassy praises decision
  to list IRGC as terrorist organisation The Israeli embassy in Australia has
  responded to Australia’s decision to list IRGC as a terrorist organisation. In
  a statement, posted to X, the embassy says it’s a step they have long
  advocated for: Iran’s regime is not only a threat to Jews or Israel, it
  endangers the entire free world, including Australia. A strong and important
  move. PM says Australian embassy staff in Iran removed quickly for safety
  Albanese and Burgess are asked a final question, on whether they’re concerned
  about further incidents, and whether there’s concern that Australians in Iran
  could face retaliatory action after the government’s announcements today.
  Burgess says Asio is “open” to the possibility of more incidents. We and the
  police are open to the possibility that could occur, and we’re doing our best
  to get it before it stops. Of course, we’re not all-seeing and all-knowing.
  Albanese says the government quickly removed Australian embassy staff to
  ensure their safety. We have said, transparently, we were provided with this
  advice and evidence, more evidence obviously than is appropriate to make
  public … So, we took that advice, we put in place measures including the safe
  removal of all of our staff from the Tehran embassy, in order to ensure they
  were kept safe. Some alleged perpetrators were paid for involvement, Asio
  director says Burgess says there’s an offshore organised crime element to the
  attacks, which are part of what he calls a “layer cake of cut-outs” between
  the IRGC and the alleged perpetrators. Cut-outs are paid intermediaries.
  Burgess says: In between them, they tap into a number of people, agents of
  IRGC, and people that they know in the criminal world, and work through there,
  so it’s a series of chains. There’s an organised crime element offshore in
  this. But that’s not to suggest organised crime are doing it. They’re just
  using cut-outs, including people who are criminal and members of organised
  crime gangs to do their bidding or direct their bidding … Some of the alleged
  perpetrators did this because they were paid to do it. Asked whether there’s a
  pattern of behaviour from Iran, and whether other countries have also been
  targeted, Burgess says: So the IRGC has form in conducting, going after
  dissident or anything they consider a threat to the regime in other countries.
  This is unique to Australia, having a crack at our social cohesion. Asio
  director says Iran was involved in ‘threatening, intimidating behaviours’ from
  October 2023 Albanese says any attack on social cohesion is an attack on
  Australia. We are proud of the country that we’ve built. A country where
  people can live overwhelmingly side by side of different faith, of different
  background, in harmony. We cherish it. We protect it. We defend it. And that’s
  what we’re doing here today. Mike Burgess is asked whether Iran is a major
  player in the antisemitic attacks, he says: If you remember, go back to 7
  October 2023, we saw the rise in tension and emotion, and we saw protest. Most
  of that, thankfully, in our great country, was peaceful protest, but there was
  some threatening intimidation, intimidating actions at that time. But it was
  on October 24 that we saw that transition. And I’m on the record of saying
  this from threatening, intimidating behaviours, to direct targeting of people,
  businesses and places of worship, Iran started the first of those. But not all
  of those are directed by Iran, in our view. Asked whether he believes Benjamin
  Netanyahu should apologise to him, Albanese says he’s not concerned about
  “personal issues”. What I’m interested in is making a difference. Making a
  difference for Australia’s social cohesion, adopting a position which is
  principled. Which is in line with what Australians want to see. Asio director
  says IRGC has direction connection to attacks but Iran embassy and diplomats
  not involved The Asio director, Mike Burgess, says the Iranian embassy and
  diplomats were not involved in the antisemitic attacks. But Burgess says he
  won’t comment further on details of the alleged perpetrators. I won’t comment
  on any matters that may or go before the courts or are before the courts and
  subject to police, investors. Police investigations. What we have said is
  there’s a direct connection that the IRGC are directing, through a series of
  cutouts, people in Australia to undertake these crimes. He says Asio informed
  the government of its assessment on Monday, but the investigations by Asio and
  the AFP have been ongoing since October last year. Wong says Iranian officials
  and ambassador have been given seven days to leave Australia The foreign
  minister, Penny Wong, says this is the first time an ambassador has been
  expelled from Australia in the postwar period. The Australian officials who
  were stationed to the Iranian embassy in Tehran are now in a third country. On
  the Iranian officials expelled from Australia, Wong says: There is no doubt
  that these extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a
  foreign nation on Australian soil have crossed a line. And that’s why we have
  declared Iran’s ambassador to Australia persona non grata, as well as three
  other Iranian officials, and they’ll have seven days to leave the country.
  Wong says the government has warned Australians not to travel to Iran, since
  2020, and reiterates that call. ‘Likely’ that further antisemitic attacks were
  directed by Iran according to Asio assessment, PM says The government will
  list Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC as a terrorist
  organisation in response to Asio’s investigation. Albanese says the two
  attacks coordinated by Iran include an attack on the Lewis Continental Kitchen
  in Sydney, 20 October 2024 and the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne,
  December 2024. Albanese says: Asio assesses it’s likely Iran directed further
  attacks as well. They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow
  discord in our community. The Australian government is taking strong and
  decisive action in response. Asio director Mike Burgess is with the PM and
  says Asio is still investigating more attacks they believe had possible
  Iranian involvement. Asio is still investigating possible Iranian involvement
  in a number of other attacks, but I want to stress we do not believe the
  regime is responsible for every act of antisemitism in Australia. It goes
  without saying that Iran’s actions are unacceptable. They put lives at risk,
  they terrified the community and they tore at our social fabric. Iran and its
  proxies lit the matches and fanned the flames. The prime minister is
  addressing reporters at parliament house and says Asio can reveal the Iranian
  government directed at least two antisemitic attacks in the Australian
  community since 7 October 2023. Albanese says: Asio has gathered enough
  credible intelligence to reach a deeply disturbing conclusion – the Iranian
  government directed at least two of these attacks. Iran has sought to disguise
  its involvement but Asio assesses it was behind the attacks. Albanese says the
  Iranian ambassador has been expelled, and he has suspended operations at
  Australia’s embassy in Tehran. Asked about the Israeli strikes on a hospital
  in Gaza overnight, Ley calls them “horrific”, but won’t say whether the
  Coalition would support more sanctions on Israelis in response. She says, as
  she has in the past, that the responsibility is on Hamas to release hostages,
  and doing so would end the conflict. This is simply horrific, simply horrific,
  and labelling it as a tragic mishap is an understatement, and Israel has
  undertaken to have a full investigation, which needs to happen, and we will
  wait for the outcome of that investigation. Israeli prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu called the strikes a “tragic mishap” in a post to social media
  platform X. Ley evades questions on how Coalition’s net zero discussion
  unfolded Sussan Ley won’t say how the debate on net zero went down in today’s
  partyroom. The Coalition leader says she won’t go into what happened in
  partyroom – other than the traditional briefing, members of a partyroom aren’t
  allowed to publicly discuss what happens during the meeting. She says: I can
  100% guarantee that it was a collegiate discussion that members did speak up
  and have their say. Journalists in the room keep pushing her for more details
  on who spoke up, including reports that Michaelia Cash asked for an immediate
  position on net zero. Ley won’t bite, and says there have been constructive
  discussions, and won’t divulge private conversations. [I am] very willing to
  have partyroom discussions. And I said that in this morning … energy policy
  discussion is always a good discussion. Ley says Coalition willing to work
  with Labor on environment law reform The first question is on net zero and
  2035 targets (no surprises there). Sussan Ley says her shadow energy minister,
  Dan Tehan, is working on energy policy, and the plan should reduce energy
  costs and play a role in reducing emissions. On how the opposition will
  respond to when the government finally announces its 2035 targets, Ley says:
  The 2035 targets and legislation that may be coming before the parliament, we
  look forward to that. That will give us an opportunity to [ask] the government
  to demonstrate what these targets will cost, how you will actually deliver on
  promises and what it will mean [for] Australia’s manufacturing businesses and
  Australian households. On a tangentially related question – with the
  government announcing this morning it will fast-track environment reforms to
  the EPBC act – Ley says the Coalition is willing to work with the government
  on “sensible reforms”. Ley was the environment minister when the original
  Graeme Samuel review was commissioned – back in 2021. I went to the then
  opposition and talked about how we might constructively use that report, the
  Samuel report, as a basis for improving and streamlining our environmental
  laws so that businesses could have certainty and the environment would be
  protected. And they said no. Anyway, they’ve reheated it to the round table.
  They’re talking about it again as if it’s a big new thing. What they need to
  do is get their act together and actually get the department working
  effectively. Ley calls home affairs legislation ‘rushed, secretive, chaotic’
  in post-partyroom presser Sussan Ley is doing a post-partyroom press
  conference. She seems to be ditching tradition, where normally a party member
  will give the media a direct briefing of what went down in the meeting, what
  issues were discussed, and what legislation will be looked at or voted on this
  week. She’s started the press conference talking about a piece of home affairs
  legislation which she calls “rushed, secretive, chaotic”. Ley says the
  emergency legislation is to close loopholes for the NZYQ cohort, a group of
  immigration detainees who were released from indefinite detention by the high
  court in 2023. It’s the fifth time that Labor has been forced to introduce
  emergency legislation in this manner. So is this legislation closing loopholes
  in previous bills that were also supposed to close loopholes? What on earth is
  going on right now? She then rubbishes the government’s economic roundtable.
  Coalition partyroom continuing to debate net zero The Coalition is still torn
  over the debate on net zero, with a clash between some of the hard right and
  the moderates at this morning’s partyroom meeting. Guardian Australia
  understands Simon Kennedy, who’s previously spoken out at partyroom to support
  net zero, was again among a few who spoke out in favour of stronger policy to
  credibly reduce emissions and reduce energy prices. It’s understood Alex
  Antic, Matt Canavan, Llew O’Brien (who spoke in favour of Barnaby Joyce’s
  repeal net zero bill on Monday) and Tony Pasin spoke against net zero. Kennedy
  won’t confirm, but in an interview on Sky News, he says the opposition needs
  to start thinking in the more immediate term, and come up with a policy plan
  to match a 2035 emissions reduction target. Net zero for this Labor
  government, it’s not a policy, it’s a slogan, and we know it’s not a policy
  and it’s a slogan because they promise price reductions, prices are up,
  emissions are flat. They’re [Labor] about to legislate 2035 targets, and we
  [the Coalition] do need real policy, we need a policy position on that. We
  know it’s going to be something between, we think 65 to 75% so we should be
  starting to think about a policy … The domestic gas reserve announced last
  election – we should reinstate that as a policy we modelled that would bring
  energy prices down… that would give us something credible to talk about around
  a 2035 [target]. RBA board says more rate cuts needed to bring inflation down,
  meeting minutes show The Reserve Bank’s monetary policy board members agree
  that bringing inflation sustainably back to target “appeared likely to require
  some further reduction in the cash rate over the coming year”. The minutes
  from the 11-12 August meeting, released this morning, revealed there was also
  broad agreement that how fast and far rates will need to be cut will depend on
  “incoming data on a meeting-by-meeting basis”. After unanimously voting in
  favour of lowering the cash rate from 3.85% to 3.6% at this month’s meeting,
  the minutes show rate moves will depend on tightness in the labour market. In
  particular, “a slightly faster reduction in the cash rate over the coming year
  … would be appropriate if the labour market turned out already to be in
  balance” - that is, if an unemployment rate at about current levels was
  consistent with inflation staying within the 2-3% target band over the coming
  couple of years. The minutes said: A slightly faster reduction would also be
  appropriate if the overall balance of risks to the forecasts became more
  clearly skewed to the downside, perhaps because of adverse developments in the
  global economy or the anticipated handover from non-market sector to market
  sector employment growth not proceeding smoothly. Monthly inflation figures
  for July will be released tomorrow, and economists expect annual consumer
  price growth will lift from 1.9% to 2.3% as government electricity bill
  subsidies elapse. Financial markets expect the next rate cut to be in
  November, and another by February, according to ANZ estimates before the
  release of the latest RBA board minutes. Recognition of Palestinian statehood
  follows international consultation, PM says Anthony Albanese has told Labor
  MPs the world is “engaging” to back a two-state solution in the Middle East,
  weeks out from the United Nations general assembly getting under way. In a
  meeting of Labor’s caucus at Parliament House, the prime minister said
  Australia had made a decision in the national interest to recognise
  Palestinian statehood at next month’s meeting in New York, following
  consultation with international partners. He told the closed door meeting he
  had consulted widely before announcing the recognition decision, including
  discussing it with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Albanese is
  seeking to build momentum for Palestinian statehood by coordinating with
  countries including the UK, Canada and France, but the announcement has
  sparked a backlash from Netanyahu’s administration. Organisations welcome
  higher education code requiring mandatory response and training to prevent
  sexual violence Leading violence against women prevention organisation, Our
  Watch, has welcomed Monday’s passing of a national higher education code to
  respond to gender-based violence in the sector. The legislation will require
  Australian universities and university-operated student accommodation
  providers to legally respond to sexual violence and take action to prevent it
  for the first time, including mandatory training and reporting requirements.
  The CEO of Our Watch, Patty Kinnersly, said the new regulations demonstrated a
  crucial shift in placing the onus on providers at the stage of prevention,
  pointing to the last National Student Safety Survey (NSSS), undertaken in
  2021, which found 1 in 6 students experienced sexual harassment. The national
  code makes it clear: prevention is not optional, it’s a core responsibility
  for every higher education and student accommodation provider. The women’s
  officer at The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations, Vaness Yap,
  said there was “no doubt” the legislation was a significant step to protect
  students, while adding the next NSSS would be “essential” to understanding
  whether the crisis had worsened and understand additional safeguards needed:
  We are excited to see renewed government momentum in the higher education
  sector … We hope that this momentum translates to action on the remaining
  Universities Accord recommendations. Greens meet to discuss aged care,
  environment law and Israel’s ‘double tap’ bombing of Gaza hospital The Greens
  party room met this morning to discuss the week’s main agendas, including aged
  care and environment law reform as well as Israel’s latest strike on a
  hospital in Gaza. From their newly constructed party room, the minor party
  discussed Labor’s proposal this morning to put forward a bill to overhaul the
  federal environmental protection regime by the end of the year. The Greens say
  they will look at the proposal but warned the federal government needed to
  remain the “ultimate decision maker” over the state governments. They expect
  debate over the new bill will happen early in 2026. The Greens are also going
  to push the Albanese government to apply the same sanctions regime against
  Israel as it does against Russia in response to its “double tap” strike
  overnight at Nasser hospital in Gaza, which killed at least 20 people
  including five journalists. The party will hold a press conference shortly.
  Albanese admits changes to NDIS and pension ‘difficult’ decisions Returning to
  the government party room, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, admitted
  changes to the NDIS and pension deeming rates were “difficult” decisions from
  the government, but that Labor believed they were in the national interest.
  Albanese in the party room meeting praised Jim Chalmers and other ministers
  for their efforts around the economic roundtable, including 40 meetings with
  individual stakeholders before the major summit. The PM also chipped the
  Coalition for its public division over the net zero goal, claiming (as he has
  publicly) “you only reject net zero if you think climate change isn’t real”.
  “We will always be focused on the Australian people, never on ourselves,”
  Albanese told the room, saying “that could involve difficult national interest
  decisions”. The PM referred to changes to the NDIS, announced last week to set
  up a new scheme that would cater for some children with autism, and the
  decision to shift the deeming rate for pensions, which means pensioners will
  be able to earn less income from financial assets before having their
  government payments affected. US president Donald Trump says he will impose
  tough new tariffs and chip export restrictions on countries pursuing digital
  services taxes against big American technology companies. Federal Labor will
  be closely watching the comments, made in the past few minutes on social
  media. “As the President of the United States, I will stand up to countries
  that attack our incredible American tech companies,” Trump wrote. Digital
  Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all
  designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology. They also,
  outrageously, give a complete pass to China’s largest Tech Companies. I put
  all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on
  notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President
  of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that
  Country’s Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our
  Highly Protected Technology and Chips. He said the US and big tech companies
  were not “the “piggy bank” nor the “doormat” of the world any longer. Show
  respect to America and our amazing Tech Companies or, consider the
  consequences! Continuing from our last post … If Aukus was successfully
  implemented, it would “strengthen its closest allies, send a powerful
  deterrent message to Beijing, and help stabilise the region,” the CSIS report
  argues. However, if it was scrapped, Denmark and Edel argue, the US would:
  Become less capable in the Indo-Pacific, its defence posture and diplomatic
  presence would become less deeply embedded, its international credibility
  would be dramatically undercut, deterrence would be undermined, and propaganda
  from Beijing and Moscow declaring the unreliability of American commitments
  would gain significant credibility”. One of the key issues of Aukus Pillar One
  centres on the “sovereignty” Australia would hold over any nuclear submarines.
  The CSIS report argues the two countries should undertake “contingency
  planning” to establish how, and under what conditions, Australia’s
  nuclear-powered submarines would be deployed in a conflict in the region.
  Planning, in which military strategists from the United States and Australia
  would jointly undergo a comprehensive process of strategising and organising
  military operations to achieve specific objectives, would provide US officials
  with more concrete reassurances that submarines sold to Australia would not
  disappear if and when needed. A former senior Pentagon official has urged the
  US not to abandon the Aukus pact, saying that would make the US “less capable”
  across the Pacific, but said Australia should give Washington more “concrete”
  commitments on how it would deploy its nuclear submarines in the event of war
  in the region. US thinktank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies
  (CSIS), has published the report, written by Abraham Denmark (an Aukus adviser
  to former US defence secretary Lloyd Austin) and Charles Edel (CSIS’s
  Australia chair) as Australian defence minister Richard Marles arrives in
  Washington DC for a series of meetings with Trump administration officials.
  The CSIS report argues Aukus is a “strategic imperative” for all three nations
  involved – the US, the UK and Australia – but the deal is at a “critical
  juncture”. Aukus is currently being reviewed by a senior Trump administration
  Pentagon official, Elbridge Colby, an avowed Aukus sceptic. Pillar One of
  Aukus will provide Australia with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered
  submarines, while Pillar Two will focus on cooperation between the three
  militaries in developing new technologies, particularly in AI, quantum
  technologies and undersea, hypersonic and electronic warfare capabilities.
  Richard Marles to meet JD Vance and Marco Rubio in Washington DC this week
  Richard Marles, the defence minister, will meet the US vice-president, JD
  Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, during his trip to Washington
  this week. Stephen Miller, a close adviser to the US president, Donald Trump,
  will also meet Marles. Marles is still yet to confirm a meeting with US
  defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, where the Aukus submarine agreement is due to
  be discussed. Marles has met with defence industry companies including Austal
  USA, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, General Dynamics, Boeing Defense and Anduril.
  Labor wants the respective industrial bases of the US and Australia to become
  increasingly seamless. Queensland’s victims commissioner quits after damning
  report Queensland’s victims commissioner has stepped down, after government
  released a damning report into an organisation she previously managed. Beck
  O’Connor was appointed in the role last year to represent victims of crime and
  make recommendations to government. On Tuesday, the minister for victim
  support, Laura Gerber, announced in parliament that she had resigned,
  effective 23 September. In her time in the role, Ms O’Connor has raised
  awareness of victims’ rights and ensured victims of crime have had a priority
  voice at the table. The Crisafulli government is committed to putting victims
  of crime first. The office of the victims’ commissioner is critical to
  identifying systemic issues relating to victims and promoting and advocating
  for the rights of victims. Acting arrangements will be in place to ensure
  continuity of important work from the office of the victims’ commissioner
  until a new appointment is made. O’Connor was CEO of helpline service
  DVConnect during a period when the government alleges, thousands of phone
  calls went unanswered. Send your political questions to the Back to Back

  overnight is “horrific”, says foreign affairs minister Penny Wong. The strikes
  killed at least 20 Palestinians including five journalists, according to
  health officials. Speaking to Channel 7, Wong said the Netanyahu government
  must agree to a ceasefire. What we’ve seen overnight with the attack on a
  hospital is horrific, and what we would say to prime minister Netanyahu is you
  should heed the call of the world and agree to a ceasefire. You should take
  the advice of your own military and agree to a ceasefire. Cabinet minister
  Murray Watt told the ABC this morning the strikes were an “outrage” and a
  “breach of international law”. Greens urge Labor to come clean on fossil fuel
  donations The Greens want Labor to explain how much the party has banked in
  political donations from fossil fuel companies ahead of the government
  announcing Australia’s 2035 emissions reduction targets, due between now and
  September. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said in the most recent data
  made public, Labor had received about $800,000 from resources companies,
  including in cash, subscriptions and tickets to party events. But donations
  data for the 2024–25 financial year, including contributions ahead of the 3
  May federal election, won’t be made public until next February. That is due to
  the reporting lag under election law in Australia. Waters says we should know
  the total amount received before the new target is announced. If Labor wants
  to show genuine climate leadership, it must open its books now, not bury this
  information until 2026, otherwise Australians will rightly question who is
  pulling the strings. When coal and gas corporations pour big money into
  politics, they’re effectively given a pen to write our climate and
  environmental laws. That’s not democracy, that’s capture. Real climate action
  should be for people and [the] planet, not private profits. Business group
  urges Labor to commit to ambitious 75% emissions target 350 businesses are
  piling pressure on the government to go hard with their 2035 emissions
  reduction target, signing an open letter calling on Labor to commit to a 75%
  target. The Business for 75 group includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Canva and
  Ikea. Their open letter comes with new analysis from Deloitte, showing a 75%
  target could bring with it an increase in Australia’s GDP by $370bn by 2035.
  Labor is waiting for the Climate Change Authority to advise on a 2035 target.
  Last year, the CCA consulted industry and climate groups on a potential target
  in the range of 65 to 75% emissions reduction on 2005 levels. The new Deloitte
  analysis says a 75% target would bring forward investment of up to an
  additional $20bn a year to 2035 compared to a 65% target, and would increase
  Australia’s competitiveness overseas. Deloitte Access Economics’ lead partner,
  Pradeep Philip, says: Getting these foundations right with a 75% target can
  drive, in today’s dollars, $190bn more exports by mid-century. A Liberal
  senator has spoken out against a planned anti-immigration protest this Sunday.
  Paul Scarr, a Queensland senator, addressed parliament last night, condemning
  the March for Australia rallies that will take place across the country. There
  are nine planned protests. The flyers accuse Labor and the Liberals of being
  “complicit” in mass migration, and singles out an increase in migration from
  India. Scarr told parliament he stands in solidarity with the Indian community
  in Australia: I am compelled to rise in this place at the earliest opportunity
  to call it out and to condemn it and say that the language and references to
  Australians of Indian heritage is unacceptable. It is outrageous … it seeks to
  divide Australians at a time when we need to unite. Fewer children attending
  childcare provider G8, but company posts $22m profit Childcare giant G8
  Education has seen profits pick up despite fewer children attending its
  centres, which it has blamed on cost-of-living pressures rather than child
  safety issues across the sector. Fewer families took up childcare spots across
  the company’s 399 centres in the first half of 2025 than the same period in
  2024, the centre said. Children also attended slightly less frequently, which
  combined saw revenue slip to $465.4m but also brought down costs, meaning
  profits soared to $22.5m. But customer satisfaction was the more important
  measure, if the comments from G8’s chief executive, Pejman Okhovat, were
  anything to go by. He started his remarks addressing the sector’s child abuse
  crisis that has seen governments rush to tighten regulation, saying in a
  statement: We recognise that safeguarding children is not just a regulatory
  obligation, it is an ethical and social licence imperative. Okhovat said
  satisfaction and employee retention were on the rise while family inquiries
  for places had remained stable compared to 2024. He told investors some
  families were delaying starting their children at a centre early in the year.
  Family satisfaction slipped slightly in April but rose again by May. G8’s
  annual report, released this morning, read: [The] impact of [the] Victorian
  incident on occupancy is localised to the impacted centres thus far, and we
  are not seeing wider trends across the state or the network. The chief
  executive also highlighted that 93.7% of G8’s centres had been rated as
  “exceeding” or “meeting” the national quality standard, which is above
  average. But that implies 25 centres have not achieved either rating, with a
  further two yet to be rated. Coles has made more than $44bn in sales revenue
  and more than $1bn in net profit across its supermarkets, online grocery
  service, and bottle shops in the past financial year. Coles Group has just
  released its results for the 12 months to 30 June, with its executives
  expected to speak to investors and journalists from 10am AEST. Of its $44.35bn
  in Coles’ overall revenue, nearly $40bn was made in its supermarkets, where
  the group reported $39.99bn in revenue. This was a net increase of 2.4% from
  the year before. However, Coles says its normalised supermarket sales, which
  account for the 53 weeks of trading in 2024, rose by 4.3%. Its alcohol sales
  didn’t fare as well, with the company reporting $3.67bn in revenue across its
  bottle shops – a net 0.7% decrease from the year before or a modest 1.1%
  increase when “normalised”. While the Coles Group’s net profit fell 3.5% to
  $1.08bn, its normalised profit rose 2.4%. Over the past year, the supermarket
  giant’s practices have come under a microscope, as the Australian Competition
  and Consumer Commission scrutinised Coles and its competitors during its
  inquiry into the supermarkets sector. Coles and Woolworths are also in the
  midst of a federal court challenge launched by the ACCC, with the consumer
  regulator alleging the companies breached the Australian Consumer Law by
  misleading customers over discount pricing claims. US parcel delivery
  suspensions ‘a very bad sign’, Tim Wilson says We’re getting more reaction
  domestically to the decision by Australia Post to suspend most parcels to the
  US as it deals with new tariff rules. The shadow minister for small business,
  Tim Wilson, says the move is “very concerning” and that small businesses will
  be most heavily affected by the decision. He told Sky News a moment ago, he
  expects the government will want to quickly deal with the new rules. I suspect
  [Ambassador] Kevin Rudd is going to be off to the White House or the Congress
  pretty quick smart, because we need to make sure this relationship is sorted.
  Because this is a very bad sign. Australia is the latest of dozens of
  countries to suspend parcels being sent to the US. The government says it’s
  been engaging with the US to remove all tariffs – with Australia currently
  receiving the lowest baseline tariff of 10% on most goods exported to the US.
  The government says US tariffs on low value imports is “disappointing”, and
  will work with Australia Post to comply with the new requirements. A
  government spokesperson said: The United States’ decision to remove exemptions
  from tariffs and duties for low value imports is disappointing and will only
  drive up costs for American families and small businesses. The Albanese
  Government will work with Australia Post to limit disruption for affected
  customers while they make adjustments to comply with new requirements. We
  continue to advocate for the removal of all tariffs on Australian exports, in
  line with our free trade agreement. Australia Post US parcel suspension
  follows similar moves in Europe Australia Post’s temporary partial suspension
  of parcels to the US follows a similar action by dozens of other nations, in
  response to the new import tariffs. 1.36bn packages were sent last year under
  the “de minimis” exemption, for parcels worth under US$800, according to US
  customs. With that exception being removed, those parcels will now face a 15%
  tariff. You can read more about that here: When will the government announce
  its 2035 emissions targets? While Labor sledges the Coalition over its
  disunity on climate action, the government still hasn’t revealed its own 2035
  emission targets, or released a long awaited climate risk report. The
  government is running out of time to announce a new target – and Watt says
  more detail will be revealed next month. But Labor is remaining tight-lipped
  on how ambitious that target will be. [Energy minister] Chris Bowen is doing a
  power of work on that at the moment, and he’s already indicated that in
  September, we’ll be revealing a lot more about that. Watt says government
  considering removing ‘duplication’ between state and federal housing approvals
  Murray Watt is continuing his media rounds, moving to Sky News, and says one
  of the red tape issues under current environment laws is where a project
  requires both state and federal approval. He gives an example of his recent
  approval of a housing development at the Queen Victoria markets in Melbourne,
  which he says followed years of consideration by the state government. We
  think that it is possible to reduce that kind of duplication in the system
  rather than having both levels of government double up. That would enable a
  much quicker approval, but at the same time, those assessments will be done
  against strong standards. Watt then brushes off concerns from the Nationals
  that some industries would get a free pass under the reforms while other
  industries like mining wouldn’t. We all know that the word environment is
  allergic to National party members. We’re seeing them run around the
  parliament constantly try to undermine Sussan Ley’s leadership on net zero …
  The sort of system that we’re looking at putting in place would treat
  different projects and different sectors in a very similar way. Australia Post
  is temporarily suspending some international parcel services to the US and
  Puerto Rico due to the Trump administration’s tariffs. The halt will prevent
  most Australian businesses from selling to US customers until a new pre-paid
  tariff system can be set up. From today parcels will have to detail their
  country of origin and a harmonised system (HS) tariff code, with tariffs on
  low-value parcels due to take effect within days. From Friday 29 August,
  parcels valued under US$800 imported into the US will attract tariffs or flat
  fees – where they were previously exempt. Australia Post will continue
  shipping letters, documents of no commercial value and gifts that are sent by
  individuals and are worth less than US$100. Australia Post Executive General
  Manager, Parcel, Post &amp; eCommerce Services, Gary Starr said in a
  statement: We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due
  to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension
  has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution
  for our customers. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, joins RN Breakfast after
  Murray Watt, and says she welcomes the urgency of getting the EPBC legislation
  into parliament this year, but the Greens want to see a climate trigger. We
  have always said that climate should be considered by our nature laws, and you
  just have to look at the algal bloom in South Australia to know that you can’t
  consider climate and nature separately … I think it was a bit artificial to
  say that you’ve got other laws that deal with climate, therefore you shouldn’t
  have the climate impact on nature considered. Asked about streamlining the
  approvals process for housing under the current EPBC act, Waters says there is
  room for greater efficiencies in the process, but ultimately the federal
  government to “uphold those international conventions and standards.” Housing
  developers will be ‘incentivised’ to provide information for faster approvals:
  Watt One of the announcements from last week’s economic roundtable was the
  fast-tracking of up to 26,000 homes currently held up by the EPBC Act. So how
  will those homes actually be fast-tracked? Murray Watt tells RN Breakfast one
  of the problems in the system is sometimes developers don’t provide all the
  information they should – and if they did, a project could be approved in as
  little as four months. This is another measure that we’re taking within our
  existing resources to focus them on clearing that backlog of housing. But also
  what we announced over the weekend is that we want to make better use of an
  existing pathway under the EPBC legislation that allows for rapid assessment
  of projects. We want to incentivise companies to do the right thing and come
  to us with all of the information that’s required, and that will enable us to
  make a much faster assessment. EPBC reforms will be in ‘spirit’ of 2021 Samuel
  review, Watt says Joining ABC Radio National Breakfast, Murray Watt says the
  EPBC reforms will be in the “spirit” of the Graeme Samuel review of the
  legislation. Graeme’s report came down nearly five years ago, but it’s been
  nearly 20 years since there’s been any proper overhaul of these laws. They’re
  not working for business, they’re not working for environment. If we don’t fix
  these laws, we won’t get the housing we need, we won’t get the renewables we
  need, and we certainly will continue to see the environment suffer. To recap,
  here’s what Samuel recommended in his review, which he handed to the previous
  Coalition government in 2021: Watt says Samuel’s recommendations fall into
  three categories: Firstly, stronger environmental protections, secondly,
  quicker and more efficient approvals, and thirdly, more transparency regarding
  decision making on environmental regulation. There are still a lot of unknowns
  with the reforms – for example, Watt has promised that the government will
  establish a federal environmental protection agency, but he’s still consulting
  on what that body will look like. In the last parliament, the government had
  just reached a deal with the Greens and members of the crossbench, to get its
  environmental laws over the line. Now that they’ve had to go back to the
  drawing board, the Coalition and the Greens will be approached for negotiation
  (as Murray Watt outlined a bit earlier). On the Today show a bit earlier the
  Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said her party is “pretty keen” for reform, but
  wants those laws to focus on the climate crisis. We need laws that actually
  act on the climate crisis, protect nature. And of course, we will always stand
  for making sure everyone’s got a home, a roof over their heads in this wealthy
  country. So the offer’s there. We’re looking forward to those discussions with
  government. Or they can choose to do a deal that will just pave the way for
  more big business profits, trash nature and leave ordinary people behind with
  the Libs. Gaza hospital strike a ‘breach of international law’: Watt Murray
  Watt says the government condemns the double bombing of a Gaza hospital which
  killed 20 people, including five journalists, according to local health
  officials. Watt says: It’s very clear that targeting or hitting hospitals,
  health workers and civilians is a breach of international law. We join with
  the rest of the international community in condemning this action. He’s asked
  on News Breakfast whether the government will place more sanctions on members
  of the Israeli government, but Watt won’t say. He repeats lines the prime
  minister has said, that the government has already applied sanctions to some
  individuals in the Israeli government. The environment minister, Murray Watt,
  says there hasn’t yet been a deal reached on critical environment laws but the
  government is “a lot closer than we were and have been for many years”. The
  government planned to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
  Conservation (EPBC) act in the last parliamentary term under the then
  environment minister, Tanya Plibersek – but that deal was scuttled at the 11th
  hour. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, he says: We have committed today to
  bring forward by several months the introduction of this legislation, we’ll be
  introducing it to the parliament this side of Christmas, and we certainly will
  be seeking the support from both the coalition and the Greens to deliver these
  reforms. A big sticking point for the Greens and some independents is a
  climate trigger – which would require the act to take into consideration the
  climate impact of a proposed project before approving it. Watt says the
  government hasn’t “settled on a position” on that issue. I would point out,
  Graham Samuel in his review [of the EPBC act] did not recommend a climate
  trigger. He expressly ruled that out. What he recommended is companies when
  they’re putting forward projects for approval, should disclose their emissions
  and what their plans are to reduce their emissions going forward. Aukus
  ‘really critical for decades to come’, Rishworth says, despite US review Aukus
  is still critical for Australia, cabinet minister Amanda Rishworth says, as
  the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, meets with his defence counterpart
  in the US. The US is currently reviewing the Aukus deal, with a report due by
  the end of the year. Rishworth is on the Today show and says Marles is working
  “very hard” with his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, and that there is
  bipartisan support for the security pact. Our three countries – the US, UK and
  Australia – have been committed to this arrangement. It is really critical for
  decades to come. Rishworth is joined by the Greens leader, Larissa Waters, who
  is far less enthusiastic about the pact. (The Greens have been highly critical
  of Aukus since its announcement). This is a dog of a deal for submarines that
  we may never receive anyway. It’s costing us an absolute motza. Good morning!
  Krishani Dhanji here with you, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started.
  Murray Watt is doing the media rounds this morning – he’s planning to put
  major environment reforms to parliament this year. (You can read more about
  the EPBC changes here). The chambers will be sitting a bit later this morning,
  because we have party room meetings – where party leaders will give their
  colleagues a bit of a gee up and they’ll discuss what policies they want to
  put forward or support over the sitting fortnight. It’s going to be a busy
  one, so let’s get going! Single Mother Families Australia calls for safety
  supplement for women who have experienced intimate partner violence Single
  mothers are carrying “herculean” emotional and financial burdens that are even
  more intense if they have fled domestic violence, Single Mother Families
  Australia (SMFA) says. A Swinburne University survey carried out for SMFA of
  2,600 women found nearly seven in 10 had experienced intimate partner violence
  (IPV) and nearly one in five were currently experiencing it. Of those, about
  one in three were experiencing financial abuse or coercive control. Almost
  four in five single mothers spend a lot or almost all of their time worrying
  about their family’s finances. SMFA says mothers are not only managing their
  own recovery, they are also supporting children who were themselves
  victim/survivors, a burden of unpaid work that is “largely invisible to
  government policy and family violence services”. SMFA is calling for measures
  including a $23,000 safety supplement paid in instalments via Family Tax
  Benefit A for women who have experienced IPV, a significant reform of the
  child support system, which allows perpetrators to continue abuse after
  separation, and an increase in the amount and duration of parenting payments.
  One mother told the survey: “Fleeing domestic violence can leave you
  financially crippled, and systems can make it worse. It takes over a decade to
  build back up from nothing. Parents who care for children deserve a living
  wage and superannuation top-ups.” Senator David Pocock has renewed his call
  for sanctions against Israel after the country’s latest attack on a hospital,
  a “double tap” strike that our correspondent in the region says bears many of
  the hallmarks of a war crime. Pocock wrote on X: Attacking health
  infrastructure, killing journalists, starving children – how many more
  flagrant breaches of international law will governments tolerate before
  sanctioning PM Netanyahu and stopping trade with Israel? As the Albanese
  government tries to curb the cost of the NDIS, a Coalition MP and father of an
  autistic child has spoken out about how he was in “two minds” about the
  reform, Australian Associated Press reports. Parents reacted with shock when
  the federal government announced last week a new scheme called Thriving Kids
  to serve as a cheaper alternative to the $44bn NDIS. Phil Thompson, the MP for
  Herbert, said “it pains me to my heart” that families feel like their children
  are an inconvenient dollar figure on a government’s budget bottom line. I know
  that reform is needed. I get that. I understand it, but it must be done in a
  way where participants aren’t waking up in the morning finding out that things
  have changed. The Coalition’s assistant NDIS spokesperson is the father of
  Emery, a five-year-old with autism. “Changes that get made quickly, changes
  that get made without consultation or minimal consultation, terrifies me as a
  father, terrifies me for my daughter’s future,” Thompson said. I’m not the
  only person in this parliament or this country that is looking at the changes
  to the NDIS with lots of fear. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has warned the
  states and territories could lose billions of dollars in extra funding for
  hospitals over five years if they failed to back his government’s plan.
  Thriving Kids will be rolled out from July 2026 and be fully implemented by
  July 2027. The Albanese government will invest $30m to lift the number of
  electrical and construction teachers in the VET system, the minister for
  skills and training, Andrew Giles, says. Giles, in a speech to be delivered to
  the National Press Club later today, will say that “equally valuing VET’ will
  be one of three priorities in this term of government. “Nine out of 10 new
  jobs will require some form of tertiary education, approximately half VET and
  half higher education,” he will say. “We will only achieve the national goal
  of four in five Australians holding a Tafe qualification or a university
  degree if we break down that artificial barrier between vocational and higher
  education.” Giles will say another priority in this term of government will be
  promoting lifelong learning, a key area identified by participants at the
  recent economic reform roundtable. “It’s the concept that knits together how
  we should be thinking about supporting people to navigate a changing world, on
  their terms. “In the context of generative AI, and indeed more generally, we
  are witnessing changes in demand for skills and [we] should anticipate this
  accelerating.” Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin
  Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji takes the
  controls. The skills minister, Andrew Giles, will tell the National Press Club
  today that the Albanese government is planning to invest $30m to lift the
  number of people who teach electrical and construction skills in the VET
  system. He will also flag the government’s plans to promote more lifelong
  learning. More details in a moment. As the Albanese government tries to find
  ways to curb the cost of the $44bn-a-year NDIS, a Liberal politician and
  father of an autistic child said he was in “two minds” about the changes and
  that it “pains him that families feel their children are ‘inconvenient’”.

Well this has been quite some day of news. Where to begin this recap? The Albanese government will invest $30m to lift the number of electrical and construction teachers in trade skills teaching. An MP with an autistic daughter revealed fears over NDIS changes. New environment reforms will be put to parliament “this side of Christmas”, Murray Watt said. Australia Post suspended parcel deliveries to the US due to the Trump administration’s tariffs. Coles posted a $1bn net profit. A Liberal senator condemned “unacceptable” targeting of Indian Australians ahead of anti-immigration protest. Penny Wong said Israel’s attack on a Gaza hospital was “horrific”. A former Pentagon official urged Australia not to abandon the Aukus pact. Donald Trump vowed fresh tariffs on countries pursuing digital services taxes against US tech giants. Australian of the Year Neale Daniher was given a standing ovation as question time began. The PM revealed that Asio had found that Iran directed at least two antisemitic attacks on Australian soil. Asked about actions taken against Iran, Albanese in question time said Iran orchestrated “extraordinary and dangerous acts” in Australia in a bid to sow discord. Tony Burke announced the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps would be listed as a terrorist organisation. Jewish leader said the community’s ‘worst fears’ were confirmed. Israel praised Australia for its ‘principled stand’ on Iranian regime. Take care. We’ll be back tomorrow. We’ve got a question on gambling advertising Yes or no, will the federal government finally ban gambling ads, as was recommended by a parliamentary committee chaired by the late Peta Murphy and last year’s “rapid review” into measures to prevent violence against women? Albanese’s response? We don’t make policy on the run. When reminded of the two reviews and asked what’s stopping the government from acting on the recommendations, Albanese said: What’s in our mind is the practicalities of whether people just go offshore, then there’s no revenue at all. They engage in gambling with no revenue coming back at all. And it doesn’t solve the problem. Could grandparents and nannies access the childcare subsidy? Shifting topic again, Albanese is asked if the federal government would consider the idea of allowing grandparents and nannies to access the childcare subsidy. The idea has been raised in the past and Albanese is careful not to dismiss it out of hand. But the prime minister stresses it would be a “very big” (and expensive) change to the system. I understand where people are coming from with that, and we certainly respect choice and families are diverse and different, and they’ll choose different ways. But that would be a very big impost on the commonwealth, on the taxpayer. Someone has to pay for it, and it would change the dynamic, I think, of the way that families operate, and the implications behind that could be taken in quite a few other directions as well. Albanese says ‘enormous wealth’ created from resources when asked about tax changes Switching to an entirely different topic, the PM is asked about the tax imposed on offshore gas producers known as the petroleum resource rent tax (or PRRT). Critics have long claimed the PRRT doesn’t raise enough revenue for taxpayers. Albanese notes the government made changes to the PRRT two years ago before dismissing the need for a Norwegian-style sovereign wealth fund. There is enormous wealth created from our resources sector. I understand that the shortcut is that some people would like those resources to not exist - that’s the truth. The argument for some of those is about PRRT, but it’s really about why don’t you stop those industries. ‘It is difficult to see how we are a major player in the Middle East’ Back to the PM’s Instagram appearance – next up are a couple of questions about sanctions on Israel amid its war in Gaza. Albanese is asked if Australia will attempt to lobby the US to pressure Israel, given global efforts thus far appear to be having a “fairly limited effect” on the actions of the Netanyahu government. It’s not up to us to put pressure on the United States. It is up to us to state what Australia’s position is very clearly. And Australia’s position has been to call for ceasefire, to call for the release of hostages, to call for a two-state solution in the long term, and to engage constructively with that the right of Israel to continue to exist with security and safety, but also the right of Palestinians to have their legitimate aspirations for their own state to be realised. When pressed on the public’s “frustration” with the apparent ineffectiveness of statements, Albanese said: As I’ve said, as much as people would like to think that somehow the Australian government can change the actions of the Israeli government, it is difficult to see how we are a major player in the Middle East. The official account of the embassy of Israel in Australia has shared a statement on X in response to today’s revelations: For decades, the Iranian regime has posed a threat to Israelis and Jewish communities around the world. Today, it became clear that this threat has reached Australian soil. The international community can no longer be complacent. Australia has taken a principled stand, others should consider following suit. Labor MP says Iran’s involvement in antisemitic attacks is ‘shocking’ and ‘a new frontier’ Josh Burns, the federal member for Macnamara, said the announcement regarding the attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue being directed by Iran, was “shocking and quite frightening” for the Jewish community. Finding out it was not some local actor but being a foreign government is “a new frontier”, he said. He also acknowledged the emotions for the Iranian community today: I want to take this opportunity also to say that the Iranian Australian community are a beautiful community. They also deeply understand what the Iranian regime is capable of and I stand in solidarity with the Iranian Australians. This is not about the proud Persian people. This is about a regime that is, frankly, attacking Australian citizens and one that has sponsored terrorism and one whose actionings need to be combatted strongly. In something a little bit different, Anthony Albanese is participating in a Q&amp;A on the ABC’s Instagram account. The public broadcaster invited punters to submit questions to the PM, who is answering a selection of them live on the social media platform. Before getting to audience questions, Albanese is asked if local authorities worked with other countries to establish Iran’s involvement in orchestrating at least two antisemitic attacks in Australia. The prime minister said: No, it was primarily Asio’s investigation and Asio came to this determination, and they advised us yesterday morning. Albanese is asked if details about further cases of Iran involvement in antisemitic attacks, beyond the two instances disclosed on Tuesday, would be revealed. What we want to do is to make sure that anything that we say publicly doesn’t interfere with any of the investigations, and so we will release more information when it’s appropriate going forward. Labor has no plans to change news media bargaining code despite Trump threats Federal Labor isn’t changing its mind on plans for the news media bargaining code, despite threats today from US president Donald Trump of tough new tariffs. Trump on Tuesday said he will impose tariffs and chip export restrictions on countries pursuing digital services taxes against big American technology companies. He said the US and tech platforms were not the “piggy bank” or “doormat” of the world. “Show respect to America and our amazing Tech Companies or, consider the consequences,” he wrote on social media. The assistant treasurer, Daniel Mulino, tells Guardian Australia there is no change to the government’s approach. Labor’s news media bargaining incentive will be a levy on digital platforms who have not renewed or initiated deals with news publishers to pay for content. A spokesperson said: The government has been clear about the plans for the News Bargaining Incentive and we have been consulting with stakeholders from both media and digital platforms to ensure the best outcomes for Australia. Turnbull says Palestinians ‘deserve a state of their own’ but there are ‘good reasons’ not to recognise statehood Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has also backed the government’s moves regarding Iran today. Appearing on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, Turnbull was also asked about whether Australia’s pledge to recognise Palestinian statehood at the UN is the right call: Well, look, it’s not a call that my government took and there are very good arguments for not recognising Palestine as a state, regardless of what you think about the cause of the Palestinians, and they clearly do deserve a state of their own and they do deserve to be protected from the violence that they’re suffering from at the moment. But the problem with Palestine is that it isn’t in control of its borders. It’s effectively occupied territory, so you can make a lawyer’s argument, and a very good one, for not recognising it as a state. I think countries that have done so – and most countries in the world have done so and now Australia is joining them – are doing so as a sign of solidarity for the Palestinian people and a sign of saying to them and to the world, we believe that you are entitled to have a state of your own. We believe in the two-state solution. You can say it’s a gesture. You can say it’s political, but it’s an approach, a viewpoint, a position that has been taken by the overwhelming majority of countries represented in the United Nations. Hastie says Coalition stands ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with Labor on Iran developments Shadow home affairs minister Andrew Hastie has praised the government’s response to the Iran news. He’s told ABC Afternoon Briefing that “we stand with the government on this shoulder to shoulder”. Hastie said he was briefed by Penny Wong and Tony Burke just before question time. Melbourne rabbi says Jewish community ‘reeling’ but ‘united’ Melbourne Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann shared his reaction to the government’s announcement that the attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue was directed by Iran. He told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: It’s shocking. The community is absolutely reeling. But there’s also a sense of an ‘I told you so’ moment overcoming the community. The community has felt under attack from two days after October 7, 2023, and we’ve been begging government for more support. In some ways, it has come. In other ways it hasn’t. Kaltman said his community “haven’t felt safe but we’ve stayed united”. “To now be told that it’s a foreign government involved in attacking Jewish Australians is horrific news.” ‘It’s absolutely terrifying’ Ryvchin said he spoke to the owners of Lewis’ Continental Kitchen – the business that was targeted in one of the two incidents the government said was directed by Iran: They were beside themselves. On one level, it brings closure, I suppose, and greater clarity as to who was responsible and why. But knowing that a foreign regime who committed terror attacks throughout the world is targeting Australian Jews – it’s absolutely terrifying. And there are so many layers to this. We’ve seen the involvement of organised crime. So to have so many lethal elements involved, it really has caused further terror in the community, no doubt. The British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert – who was held for 804 days by the Revolutionary Guards, most of it in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison – said the Iranian embassy in Canberra had long played a “sinister role in sponsoring the surveillance of dissidents here in Australia”. For years now the Iranian-Australian community and other victims of the IRGC, including myself, have been literally screaming at rallies, to our local MPs, in parliamentary consultations and in reports to the national security hotline that Iranian agents are operating brazenly and with few consequences here on Australian soil. It’s been a big news day. Here’s a quick catchup on the news about Iran and antisemitic attacks: Australia’s domestic intelligence agency Asio says it has intelligence that Iran directed at least two major antisemitic attacks in Australia in 2024: Lewis’ Continental Kitchen in Sydney on 20 October, and the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on 6 December. Asio believes there are links between the alleged crimes and “commanders in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC.” Director general Mike Burgess claimed the IRGC “used a complex web of proxies to hide its involvement”, but that criminals in Australia were paid to carry out these attacks. Burgess claimed IRGC officials were “directing through a series of cut-outs, people in Australia to undertake the crimes”. The government will legislate to list the IRGC as a terrorist organisation, Anthony Albanese said. Asio believes at least two, and potentially more, of the antisemitic attacks were directed by Iran, with the aim of “messing with social cohesion in Australia”. Iran’s ambassador to Australia has been expelled, and will have seven days to leave the country along with three other Iranian officials. However Burgess said the Iranian embassy was not involved in the attacks, nor any Iranian diplomats in Australia. Australia has withdrawn its ambassador in Iran, and suspended operations of our embassy there; Australian diplomats are now safe in a third country, Albanese said. Australians have long been urged not to travel to Iran, and the government has repeated those warnings, recommending Australians leave Iran now if it is safe to do so. Jewish leader says attacks ‘sent terror through our community’ Ryvchin went on, thanking the government for the measures it has taken since the announcement: These attacks … deliberately targeted the Jewish community, destroyed a sacred house of worship, caused millions of dollars of damage and sent terror through our community. For many years, we have warned of the threat posed by the Iranian regime. This is a regime that not only subjugates its own people and war in the Middle East using its proxies, it has the capability and willingness to project terror throughout the world. The entity responsible for this attack is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp and it is therefore entirely appropriate that our government has decided to designate them as a terrorist organisation in addition to expelling the Iranian ambassador. Two measures that we thank and commend the Australian government, and that we have long advocated for as well. Alex Ryvchin, the co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, says the government’s announcement that two antisemitic attacks were orchestrated by the Iranian regime “confirms our community’s worst fears”. Two of these attacks were plotted and orchestrated by a foreign entity operating on Australian soil. The Australian Jewish community is foremost deeply grateful to the men and women of the AFP, Asio and state police for keeping us safe. For their steel-minded commitment to pursuing these people, solving these crime and bringing the perpetrators to justice. These attacks instigated by the Iranian regime are an attack on our nation and our sovereignty, and as Australians, we are outraged by them. Hello and let’s jump straight into it. Alex Ryvchin, from the executive council of Australian Jewry, has been speaking in Sydney in response to today’s news. Thanks all for joining me on the blog today. I’ll leave you with the lovely Natasha May. I’ll see you here bright and early tomorrow. Tl;dr here’s what happened in QT Question time started on the revelations of Asio finding that Iran directed antisemitic attacks on Australian soil. The Coalition then moved on to tax questions, trying to get the government to rule out tax changes to housing, family trusts and farms. The government wouldn’t bite, and attacked the Coalition on its own policy promises at the last election. Independent MP Allegra Spender asked the prime minister if the government will work with the Jewish community to keep them safe. The PM says he spoke to Jewish leaders earlier today before the press conference, and that the government has rolled out funding for security for schools and community groups – but he doesn’t foreshadow any further funding. Greens back decision to expel Iranian ambassador and list IRGC as terror group The Greens have backed the federal government’s decision to expel the Iranian ambassador and list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation after revelations of Iran’s role in orchestrating at least two antisemitic attacks in Australia. The Greens defence and foreign affairs spokesman, David Shoebridge, said the party had been calling for the listing of the IRGC for more than 12 months. Shoebridge said: We have heard from the (Iranian) diaspora community here that they do feel a sense of transnational repression. They felt that the Iranian regime is making them less safe in their communities. It is is deeply unfortunate that it’s taken this most recent incident for the government to come forward with that action, but in solidarity with the Iranian diaspora and acknowledging the vile nature of those antisemitic attacks, we again say to the government, we will assist in that pathway through the Senate for legislation to permit the listing of the IRGC. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has made a statement to question time, confirming she has been briefed by the prime minister regarding the Iranian government being behind the attack at the the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne last year. She told the chamber the announcement had “extraordinary implications” from Victoria’s national security. For the first time since World War II, the Australian government has expelled an ambassador, and we support this decision without reservation, just as we have supported the joint investigation every step of the way. I’ll start by saying that this is an ongoing investigation, and there are still some facts that we don’t know, but here’s what we do know. In December last year, terrorism shattered the peace in Melbourne and destroyed a synagogue built by Holocaust survivors. The target of this act of terror was Victoria’s Jewish community. I visited Adass Israel Synagogue twice in the days after that attack, I will never forget the smell of burnt books. I will never forget the burns on their hands, and I will never forget thinking just how close this came to being a mass casualty event. My anger at the perpetrators of this act of terror will never, ever subside. Allan says she spoke to Benjamin Klein from the the synagogue earlier today and expressed “the love and support of all Victorians”. Speaker, the fear the Jewish community are feeling after this news is real and intense. And let me say this, when you inflict hurt and pain on one, you inflict it on all. This attack was not just an attack on Victoria’s Jewish community, it was an attack on all Victorians. And I say this to the Jewish community, your safety is our safety. We stand with you. We stand with your right to pray in peace, your right to live in this state in safety. Bowen: ‘One Coalition, and many, many ways of killing net zero’ The government has pounced on the growing disunity over climate and net zero in the Coalition party room. Chris Bowen ends question time with a dixer on Labor’s “clear and consistent” climate and energy policy. Bowen lists a few of the government’s policies and then digs into the opposition: What we have is two parties, one Coalition, and many, many ways of killing net zero. All that leads to net zero plan for the future of Australia, net zero plan for Australia’s regions who are relying on the Australian government to deal with the challenges of climate change and the impacts of drought and flood. We’ll probably be hearing those lines for a while. Will Australia update its plastics policies? Zali Steggall gets the next crossbench question, and asks about plastic pollution. She says Australians are one of the world’s largest users of single-use plastic, and asks whether the government will update our plastics plan when negotiations globally aren’t reaching a consensus. Tony Burke takes the question, representing the environment minister and says Australia has played a key role in negotiations for a plastics treaty. He also says the government has delivered more than $1bn with state and territory governments and industries to boost recycling. But he doesn’t give a clear answer on whether Australia’s plastics policy will be updated. We’re fighting on the international stage for binding treaty to end plastic pollution by 2040. All members are concerned about this … The government is committed to being part of that international action. ‘Get a clue’: housing minister hits back at ‘nonsensical’ question about taxing spare bedrooms Back to QT, the Liberal MP Ben Small asks housing minister Clare O’Neil whether the government will tax spare bedrooms. O’Neil is pretty scathing and says the opposition is living in a “bizarre fantasy land”.She then also takes a stab at the shadow housing minister, Andrew Bragg (who sits in the Senate). I heard these questions are getting asked over at the other place [Senate] today and I thought the shadow Housing Minister has not had his Weet-Bix for breakfast this morning, I do not know what he is going on about. Small starts arguing back and Milton Dick tells him to pipe down. So O’Neil continues The very last people that Australians should listen to when it comes to housing policy are those who sit opposite. Remember for almost a decade they sat on these benches and did nothing about a housing crisis building before their very eyes. They then spent three years being housing hypocrites… now they’re asking nonsensical questions about policies that don’t even exist. Get a clue. Video – Australia expels Iranian ambassador over evidence Iran directed antisemitic attacks Jumping out of question time for a moment – you can watch some of that earlier press conference with the prime minister and Asio director general Mike Burgess below. To recap, Anthony Albanese revealed Asio suspects Iran directed two antisemitic attacks on Australian soil. The IRGC will soon be listed as a terrorist organisation. Foreign minister Penny Wong confirmed Iran’s ambassador and other embassy officials had been asked to leave Australia within seven days. Burgess said the embassy was not involved in the attacks. Albanese says government has boosted security for Jewish communities Allegra Spender, the independent MP for Wentworth, represents the area where the antisemitic attack occurred on Lewis’ Continental Kitchen in Sydney. Spender says the security concerns of her community and the Jewish community are real and justified and asks if the government will work with the community to keep them safe. Albanese says the government informed Jewish community leaders of the revelations before the press conference earlier this afternoon. He says the government has increased security arrangements for the Jewish community, and will continue to work with them. What we certainly can have control over here is making sure that we do not bring conflict here, that we keep social cohesion. We have a range of programs including increased security arrangements around schools, around synagogues. The increased support that we have put forward will continue to have dialogue with the community and to work with them in order to ensure that like other Australians, every Australian should feel safe and yesterday, I spoke with the Australian union of Jewish students… the Australian way is to respect each other, regardless of people’s faith, regardless of their origin and to engage in constructive dialogue about issues not to engage in the sort of activity which we have seen. Family farms in focus Daniel Mulino gets another question, this time from the Nationals MP Anne Webster, who asks whether the government will make any changes to the tax treatment of family farms. Mulino says the question is in contrast to comments from the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, who he says said that tax policy ideas shouldn’t be taken off the table. The shadow treasurer made some interesting comments in the lead-up to the roundtable, where he said, let’s be fair dinkum here, we shouldn’t be taking anything off the table. What I can stress again is that we took a range of tax policies to the last election, implementing those tax policies is our priority, that remains our priority. He won’t explicitly address the question, and say whether tax treatment will change for family farms. ‘We have not changed any of our positions on tax’ I’m sensing more of a theme here … Kevin Hogan, the deputy Nationals leader, is up next and asks whether the assistant treasurer will rule out tax changes to family trusts. Daniel Mulino stands up and says the the economic roundtable was an “important forum” and says government has not changed its position on tax. We have not changed any of our positions on tax. We have clear tax policy that we look to the last election. Hogan tries to make a point of order, but Mulino sits down and says he’s finished his answer. ‘I missed the question. I just heard the sledge’ Sussan Ley is back up, and is asking again whether the government is going to hike up taxes, with the treasurer having said he’s “open minded” to tax changes. She tries to get a bit quippy: Can the prime minister confirm that having successfully eliminated the member for Chifley and Isaacs from cabinet, the treasurer is now working on eliminating Australian savings with a fresh round of taxes. A bit of context here – she’s referring to Ed Husic and Mark Dreyfus who were booted from the cabinet after the election. So Albanese immediately seizes on the talk of division. Credit where credit is due. It takes guts to talk about division in the party room from people who have just come from a room over there … the leader of the Liberal party in the Senate … led the charge to abolish net zero in the party room today ... they are all over the shop, Mr Speaker. Unsurprisingly the opposition tries to stop the PM attacking the Coalition and says Albanese is “obsessed” with the opposition. Milton Dick tells the PM, now that he’s had his preamble, to get to the point. Albanese doesn’t. He says: I missed the question. I just heard the sledge … it’s hard to follow the plots over there, the Liberals fighting each other, the Nationals fighting each other, Liberals fighting the Nationals. Aged care minister asked about home care packages To the crossbench, Rebekha Sharkie asks the aged care minister about the delay in aged care home packages. She says there are now more than 100,000 older Australians on the waiting list for home care packages. Older Australians are dying while waiting for aged care. What justification does the government have for delaying the promised home care packages from July to November this year? Sam Rae, the aged care minister, says the government is preparing to implement the new aged care act on 1 November, which is when the new home care packages will come online. As our population ages, we have seen demand for in-home care grow very, very fast. There are now more than 300,000 people accessing home care packages today, compared to just 150,000 people back in 2020. The brief deferral of the commencement of the new aged care act is to ensure that programs like support at home are ready for older Australians and their families. The Labor government continues to deliver more care for more Australians, and we have given aged care providers more time to prepare their clients, support their workers and get their systems ready for these historic changes. Rae says that there will be an additional 80,000 home care packages that will come online in the first 12 months from 1 November. Remember the roundtable? Sussan Ley is back at the mic, and we’re going back to the “government’s three day talk fest” (i.e the economic roundtable). She asks whether the PM is aware of any work the treasurer has commissioned on new housing taxes, a new death tax, wealth tax, tradie tax, or levies on Australian businesses. The PM says the opposition “snuck out” its costings before the last election which revealed “a $75bn higher figure in personal income taxes.” Spoiler alert, we don’t get very far before the opposition’s manager of business, Alex Hawke stands up. (There’s a bit of back and forth here, Hawke says he’s being heckled, while Milton Dick tells him to get to his point of order or risk getting kicked out). The point of order is on relevance but Dick says says Albanese is being relevant because it was a broad question. I’m being directly relevant to what I was asked about, which was policies from non-government members raised last week. And he adds that while Hawke may have said he didn’t want to be at the economic roundtable, he should talk to Ted O’Brien, who did. We saw the manager of opposition business just say he didn’t want to go to the roundtable. Well, talk to the bloke next to you. He was there. He was there. He got an invite. And he was keen, Mr Speaker. He even came to drinks at the Lodge and he was very welcome. Tony Burke says the government will change the criminal code to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. In the first dixer, Burke, the home affairs minister, says the existing criminal code was designed decades ago, to “deal with different threats to what we’re now facing”. Burke says these attacks were aimed at creating fear and eroding social cohesion. This is an unprecedented attack on our society. It is aimed at creating fear. It’s stoking internal divisions and eroding our social cohesion. And while after the attacks it was described in the media that no-one was injured, that’s true, but people were harmed. The people who are part of that community at the Adass Israel synagogue were harmed. The owners of the Lewis continental kitchen and all their customers were harmed. The local communities around were harmed, the Jewish community was harmed, and we as a nation were harmed. There is antisemitism in Australia, it is real, it is ugly, it is debilitating. He says the blame must not fall on Australians of Iranian descent. We don’t take the expulsion lightly, PM says Albanese says this is the “most serious response” any Australian government has given. We don’t expel an ambassador lightly because of the consequences of that which aren’t obviously all upside. But we do think that it is an appropriate response given the extraordinary behaviour and the direct link they’ve been able to draw through a direct chain to individuals and to the IRGC. On indulgence, Sussan Ley says the Coalition and government are “entirely united” on the measures announced today. We are all disgusted to learn of the serious and chilling foreign interference which has been perpetrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran on Australian soil. These acts of egregious foreign interference are brazen attempts to cleaver apart our social cohesion, to turn neighbour against neighbour and Australian against Australian. I therefore want to make it abundantly clear from the opposition, while we sit opposite the government in this chamber, we’re entirely united on the measures announced today Moving on to questions, Sussan Ley asks Anthony Albanese about the Iranian ambassador’s expulsion and listing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. She says the Coalition has previously called for these actions, and supports them. Albanese says Australians have witnessed a number of “appalling antisemitic attacks” against the Jewish community, and recaps Asio’s latest findings. Iran has sought to disguise its involvement through the use of criminal elements being paid here in Australia. Asio assesses that apart from these two attacks, it is likely there are more as well. These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil. They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community. Albanese says the embassy staff in Tehran were evacuated to a third country safely before the revelations by Asio were made public. The actions of my government send a very clear message to nations like Iran, who seek to interfere in our country, that your aggression will not be tolerated. Albanese also says the government has briefed the premiers of Victoria and NSW, and also spoke with Allegra Spender, the federal member for Wentworth, where one of the two attacks took place. It’s question time Parliamentarians have filed through to their chambers, but before questions begin, Anthony Albanese is giving a shoutout to 2025 Australian of the Year, Neale Daniher. What you have done is truly extraordinary. Through fighting MND, those iconic beanies and the famous Big Freeze slide on the King’s Birthday at the ‘G, $117m has been raised to fund research into a cure. I know this whole parliament is proud to support those efforts as governments from both sides have over many years. Daniher is in the House, and receives a standing ovation. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, joins, celebrating the work Daniher has done to raise awareness and money to fight motor neurone disease. Coalition environment spokesperson says Labor failing to live up to EPBC Act reform commitments The Coalition environment spokesperson, Angie Bell, says her door is open to the government on its environmental reforms, accusing Labor of failing to live up to its commitments. “This government has had plenty of time to decide to update the EPBC Act and reform it, and it has failed,” she told a doorstop in Parliament House earlier. What I will also say, and I have said on record, is that my door is absolutely open to the minister in terms of detail around what he intends to do with the reform that is under way. I want to make sure that stakeholders are thoroughly engaged during this process, and I would love to meet again with the Minister. Labor minister Murray Watt said the government wanted to pass the bill by the end of this year, after efforts stalled and the government scrapped its plans for environmental reform in its first term. Bell says the Coalition wants to talk, but hasn’t heard details of the new bill. I met with [Watt] once to discuss this moving forward, but let’s see what the government brings forward in terms of what they consider will be acceptable to all the stakeholders. We really want to work with the government on this because it’s too important to get this reform wrong. It is well overdue, and the government has had time on its hands to actually reform this act … but we don’t know the detail. We haven’t heard the details. We haven’t been asked for another meeting on the details, so I will scrutinise very closely what the government brings forward when they do that. Israeli embassy praises decision to list IRGC as terrorist organisation The Israeli embassy in Australia has responded to Australia’s decision to list IRGC as a terrorist organisation. In a statement, posted to X, the embassy says it’s a step they have long advocated for: Iran’s regime is not only a threat to Jews or Israel, it endangers the entire free world, including Australia. A strong and important move. PM says Australian embassy staff in Iran removed quickly for safety Albanese and Burgess are asked a final question, on whether they’re concerned about further incidents, and whether there’s concern that Australians in Iran could face retaliatory action after the government’s announcements today. Burgess says Asio is “open” to the possibility of more incidents. We and the police are open to the possibility that could occur, and we’re doing our best to get it before it stops. Of course, we’re not all-seeing and all-knowing. Albanese says the government quickly removed Australian embassy staff to ensure their safety. We have said, transparently, we were provided with this advice and evidence, more evidence obviously than is appropriate to make public … So, we took that advice, we put in place measures including the safe removal of all of our staff from the Tehran embassy, in order to ensure they were kept safe. Some alleged perpetrators were paid for involvement, Asio director says Burgess says there’s an offshore organised crime element to the attacks, which are part of what he calls a “layer cake of cut-outs” between the IRGC and the alleged perpetrators. Cut-outs are paid intermediaries. Burgess says: In between them, they tap into a number of people, agents of IRGC, and people that they know in the criminal world, and work through there, so it’s a series of chains. There’s an organised crime element offshore in this. But that’s not to suggest organised crime are doing it. They’re just using cut-outs, including people who are criminal and members of organised crime gangs to do their bidding or direct their bidding … Some of the alleged perpetrators did this because they were paid to do it. Asked whether there’s a pattern of behaviour from Iran, and whether other countries have also been targeted, Burgess says: So the IRGC has form in conducting, going after dissident or anything they consider a threat to the regime in other countries. This is unique to Australia, having a crack at our social cohesion. Asio director says Iran was involved in ‘threatening, intimidating behaviours’ from October 2023 Albanese says any attack on social cohesion is an attack on Australia. We are proud of the country that we’ve built. A country where people can live overwhelmingly side by side of different faith, of different background, in harmony. We cherish it. We protect it. We defend it. And that’s what we’re doing here today. Mike Burgess is asked whether Iran is a major player in the antisemitic attacks, he says: If you remember, go back to 7 October 2023, we saw the rise in tension and emotion, and we saw protest. Most of that, thankfully, in our great country, was peaceful protest, but there was some threatening intimidation, intimidating actions at that time. But it was on October 24 that we saw that transition. And I’m on the record of saying this from threatening, intimidating behaviours, to direct targeting of people, businesses and places of worship, Iran started the first of those. But not all of those are directed by Iran, in our view. Asked whether he believes Benjamin Netanyahu should apologise to him, Albanese says he’s not concerned about “personal issues”. What I’m interested in is making a difference. Making a difference for Australia’s social cohesion, adopting a position which is principled. Which is in line with what Australians want to see. Asio director says IRGC has direction connection to attacks but Iran embassy and diplomats not involved The Asio director, Mike Burgess, says the Iranian embassy and diplomats were not involved in the antisemitic attacks. But Burgess says he won’t comment further on details of the alleged perpetrators. I won’t comment on any matters that may or go before the courts or are before the courts and subject to police, investors. Police investigations. What we have said is there’s a direct connection that the IRGC are directing, through a series of cutouts, people in Australia to undertake these crimes. He says Asio informed the government of its assessment on Monday, but the investigations by Asio and the AFP have been ongoing since October last year. Wong says Iranian officials and ambassador have been given seven days to leave Australia The foreign minister, Penny Wong, says this is the first time an ambassador has been expelled from Australia in the postwar period. The Australian officials who were stationed to the Iranian embassy in Tehran are now in a third country. On the Iranian officials expelled from Australia, Wong says: There is no doubt that these extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil have crossed a line. And that’s why we have declared Iran’s ambassador to Australia persona non grata, as well as three other Iranian officials, and they’ll have seven days to leave the country. Wong says the government has warned Australians not to travel to Iran, since 2020, and reiterates that call. ‘Likely’ that further antisemitic attacks were directed by Iran according to Asio assessment, PM says The government will list Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC as a terrorist organisation in response to Asio’s investigation. Albanese says the two attacks coordinated by Iran include an attack on the Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney, 20 October 2024 and the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne, December 2024. Albanese says: Asio assesses it’s likely Iran directed further attacks as well. They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community. The Australian government is taking strong and decisive action in response. Asio director Mike Burgess is with the PM and says Asio is still investigating more attacks they believe had possible Iranian involvement. Asio is still investigating possible Iranian involvement in a number of other attacks, but I want to stress we do not believe the regime is responsible for every act of antisemitism in Australia. It goes without saying that Iran’s actions are unacceptable. They put lives at risk, they terrified the community and they tore at our social fabric. Iran and its proxies lit the matches and fanned the flames. The prime minister is addressing reporters at parliament house and says Asio can reveal the Iranian government directed at least two antisemitic attacks in the Australian community since 7 October 2023. Albanese says: Asio has gathered enough credible intelligence to reach a deeply disturbing conclusion – the Iranian government directed at least two of these attacks. Iran has sought to disguise its involvement but Asio assesses it was behind the attacks. Albanese says the Iranian ambassador has been expelled, and he has suspended operations at Australia’s embassy in Tehran. Asked about the Israeli strikes on a hospital in Gaza overnight, Ley calls them “horrific”, but won’t say whether the Coalition would support more sanctions on Israelis in response. She says, as she has in the past, that the responsibility is on Hamas to release hostages, and doing so would end the conflict. This is simply horrific, simply horrific, and labelling it as a tragic mishap is an understatement, and Israel has undertaken to have a full investigation, which needs to happen, and we will wait for the outcome of that investigation. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strikes a “tragic mishap” in a post to social media platform X. Ley evades questions on how Coalition’s net zero discussion unfolded Sussan Ley won’t say how the debate on net zero went down in today’s partyroom. The Coalition leader says she won’t go into what happened in partyroom – other than the traditional briefing, members of a partyroom aren’t allowed to publicly discuss what happens during the meeting. She says: I can 100% guarantee that it was a collegiate discussion that members did speak up and have their say. Journalists in the room keep pushing her for more details on who spoke up, including reports that Michaelia Cash asked for an immediate position on net zero. Ley won’t bite, and says there have been constructive discussions, and won’t divulge private conversations. [I am] very willing to have partyroom discussions. And I said that in this morning … energy policy discussion is always a good discussion. Ley says Coalition willing to work with Labor on environment law reform The first question is on net zero and 2035 targets (no surprises there). Sussan Ley says her shadow energy minister, Dan Tehan, is working on energy policy, and the plan should reduce energy costs and play a role in reducing emissions. On how the opposition will respond to when the government finally announces its 2035 targets, Ley says: The 2035 targets and legislation that may be coming before the parliament, we look forward to that. That will give us an opportunity to [ask] the government to demonstrate what these targets will cost, how you will actually deliver on promises and what it will mean [for] Australia’s manufacturing businesses and Australian households. On a tangentially related question – with the government announcing this morning it will fast-track environment reforms to the EPBC act – Ley says the Coalition is willing to work with the government on “sensible reforms”. Ley was the environment minister when the original Graeme Samuel review was commissioned – back in 2021. I went to the then opposition and talked about how we might constructively use that report, the Samuel report, as a basis for improving and streamlining our environmental laws so that businesses could have certainty and the environment would be protected. And they said no. Anyway, they’ve reheated it to the round table. They’re talking about it again as if it’s a big new thing. What they need to do is get their act together and actually get the department working effectively. Ley calls home affairs legislation ‘rushed, secretive, chaotic’ in post-partyroom presser Sussan Ley is doing a post-partyroom press conference. She seems to be ditching tradition, where normally a party member will give the media a direct briefing of what went down in the meeting, what issues were discussed, and what legislation will be looked at or voted on this week. She’s started the press conference talking about a piece of home affairs legislation which she calls “rushed, secretive, chaotic”. Ley says the emergency legislation is to close loopholes for the NZYQ cohort, a group of immigration detainees who were released from indefinite detention by the high court in 2023. It’s the fifth time that Labor has been forced to introduce emergency legislation in this manner. So is this legislation closing loopholes in previous bills that were also supposed to close loopholes? What on earth is going on right now? She then rubbishes the government’s economic roundtable. Coalition partyroom continuing to debate net zero The Coalition is still torn over the debate on net zero, with a clash between some of the hard right and the moderates at this morning’s partyroom meeting. Guardian Australia understands Simon Kennedy, who’s previously spoken out at partyroom to support net zero, was again among a few who spoke out in favour of stronger policy to credibly reduce emissions and reduce energy prices. It’s understood Alex Antic, Matt Canavan, Llew O’Brien (who spoke in favour of Barnaby Joyce’s repeal net zero bill on Monday) and Tony Pasin spoke against net zero. Kennedy won’t confirm, but in an interview on Sky News, he says the opposition needs to start thinking in the more immediate term, and come up with a policy plan to match a 2035 emissions reduction target. Net zero for this Labor government, it’s not a policy, it’s a slogan, and we know it’s not a policy and it’s a slogan because they promise price reductions, prices are up, emissions are flat. They’re [Labor] about to legislate 2035 targets, and we [the Coalition] do need real policy, we need a policy position on that. We know it’s going to be something between, we think 65 to 75% so we should be starting to think about a policy … The domestic gas reserve announced last election – we should reinstate that as a policy we modelled that would bring energy prices down… that would give us something credible to talk about around a 2035 [target]. RBA board says more rate cuts needed to bring inflation down, meeting minutes show The Reserve Bank’s monetary policy board members agree that bringing inflation sustainably back to target “appeared likely to require some further reduction in the cash rate over the coming year”. The minutes from the 11-12 August meeting, released this morning, revealed there was also broad agreement that how fast and far rates will need to be cut will depend on “incoming data on a meeting-by-meeting basis”. After unanimously voting in favour of lowering the cash rate from 3.85% to 3.6% at this month’s meeting, the minutes show rate moves will depend on tightness in the labour market. In particular, “a slightly faster reduction in the cash rate over the coming year … would be appropriate if the labour market turned out already to be in balance” - that is, if an unemployment rate at about current levels was consistent with inflation staying within the 2-3% target band over the coming couple of years. The minutes said: A slightly faster reduction would also be appropriate if the overall balance of risks to the forecasts became more clearly skewed to the downside, perhaps because of adverse developments in the global economy or the anticipated handover from non-market sector to market sector employment growth not proceeding smoothly. Monthly inflation figures for July will be released tomorrow, and economists expect annual consumer price growth will lift from 1.9% to 2.3% as government electricity bill subsidies elapse. Financial markets expect the next rate cut to be in November, and another by February, according to ANZ estimates before the release of the latest RBA board minutes. Recognition of Palestinian statehood follows international consultation, PM says Anthony Albanese has told Labor MPs the world is “engaging” to back a two-state solution in the Middle East, weeks out from the United Nations general assembly getting under way. In a meeting of Labor’s caucus at Parliament House, the prime minister said Australia had made a decision in the national interest to recognise Palestinian statehood at next month’s meeting in New York, following consultation with international partners. He told the closed door meeting he had consulted widely before announcing the recognition decision, including discussing it with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Albanese is seeking to build momentum for Palestinian statehood by coordinating with countries including the UK, Canada and France, but the announcement has sparked a backlash from Netanyahu’s administration. Organisations welcome higher education code requiring mandatory response and training to prevent sexual violence Leading violence against women prevention organisation, Our Watch, has welcomed Monday’s passing of a national higher education code to respond to gender-based violence in the sector. The legislation will require Australian universities and university-operated student accommodation providers to legally respond to sexual violence and take action to prevent it for the first time, including mandatory training and reporting requirements. The CEO of Our Watch, Patty Kinnersly, said the new regulations demonstrated a crucial shift in placing the onus on providers at the stage of prevention, pointing to the last National Student Safety Survey (NSSS), undertaken in 2021, which found 1 in 6 students experienced sexual harassment. The national code makes it clear: prevention is not optional, it’s a core responsibility for every higher education and student accommodation provider. The women’s officer at The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations, Vaness Yap, said there was “no doubt” the legislation was a significant step to protect students, while adding the next NSSS would be “essential” to understanding whether the crisis had worsened and understand additional safeguards needed: We are excited to see renewed government momentum in the higher education sector … We hope that this momentum translates to action on the remaining Universities Accord recommendations. Greens meet to discuss aged care, environment law and Israel’s ‘double tap’ bombing of Gaza hospital The Greens party room met this morning to discuss the week’s main agendas, including aged care and environment law reform as well as Israel’s latest strike on a hospital in Gaza. From their newly constructed party room, the minor party discussed Labor’s proposal this morning to put forward a bill to overhaul the federal environmental protection regime by the end of the year. The Greens say they will look at the proposal but warned the federal government needed to remain the “ultimate decision maker” over the state governments. They expect debate over the new bill will happen early in 2026. The Greens are also going to push the Albanese government to apply the same sanctions regime against Israel as it does against Russia in response to its “double tap” strike overnight at Nasser hospital in Gaza, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists. The party will hold a press conference shortly. Albanese admits changes to NDIS and pension ‘difficult’ decisions Returning to the government party room, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, admitted changes to the NDIS and pension deeming rates were “difficult” decisions from the government, but that Labor believed they were in the national interest. Albanese in the party room meeting praised Jim Chalmers and other ministers for their efforts around the economic roundtable, including 40 meetings with individual stakeholders before the major summit. The PM also chipped the Coalition for its public division over the net zero goal, claiming (as he has publicly) “you only reject net zero if you think climate change isn’t real”. “We will always be focused on the Australian people, never on ourselves,” Albanese told the room, saying “that could involve difficult national interest decisions”. The PM referred to changes to the NDIS, announced last week to set up a new scheme that would cater for some children with autism, and the decision to shift the deeming rate for pensions, which means pensioners will be able to earn less income from financial assets before having their government payments affected. US president Donald Trump says he will impose tough new tariffs and chip export restrictions on countries pursuing digital services taxes against big American technology companies. Federal Labor will be closely watching the comments, made in the past few minutes on social media. “As the President of the United States, I will stand up to countries that attack our incredible American tech companies,” Trump wrote. Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology. They also, outrageously, give a complete pass to China’s largest Tech Companies. I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country’s Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips. He said the US and big tech companies were not “the “piggy bank” nor the “doormat” of the world any longer. Show respect to America and our amazing Tech Companies or, consider the consequences! Continuing from our last post … If Aukus was successfully implemented, it would “strengthen its closest allies, send a powerful deterrent message to Beijing, and help stabilise the region,” the CSIS report argues. However, if it was scrapped, Denmark and Edel argue, the US would: Become less capable in the Indo-Pacific, its defence posture and diplomatic presence would become less deeply embedded, its international credibility would be dramatically undercut, deterrence would be undermined, and propaganda from Beijing and Moscow declaring the unreliability of American commitments would gain significant credibility”. One of the key issues of Aukus Pillar One centres on the “sovereignty” Australia would hold over any nuclear submarines. The CSIS report argues the two countries should undertake “contingency planning” to establish how, and under what conditions, Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines would be deployed in a conflict in the region. Planning, in which military strategists from the United States and Australia would jointly undergo a comprehensive process of strategising and organising military operations to achieve specific objectives, would provide US officials with more concrete reassurances that submarines sold to Australia would not disappear if and when needed. A former senior Pentagon official has urged the US not to abandon the Aukus pact, saying that would make the US “less capable” across the Pacific, but said Australia should give Washington more “concrete” commitments on how it would deploy its nuclear submarines in the event of war in the region. US thinktank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has published the report, written by Abraham Denmark (an Aukus adviser to former US defence secretary Lloyd Austin) and Charles Edel (CSIS’s Australia chair) as Australian defence minister Richard Marles arrives in Washington DC for a series of meetings with Trump administration officials. The CSIS report argues Aukus is a “strategic imperative” for all three nations involved – the US, the UK and Australia – but the deal is at a “critical juncture”. Aukus is currently being reviewed by a senior Trump administration Pentagon official, Elbridge Colby, an avowed Aukus sceptic. Pillar One of Aukus will provide Australia with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines, while Pillar Two will focus on cooperation between the three militaries in developing new technologies, particularly in AI, quantum technologies and undersea, hypersonic and electronic warfare capabilities. Richard Marles to meet JD Vance and Marco Rubio in Washington DC this week Richard Marles, the defence minister, will meet the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, during his trip to Washington this week. Stephen Miller, a close adviser to the US president, Donald Trump, will also meet Marles. Marles is still yet to confirm a meeting with US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, where the Aukus submarine agreement is due to be discussed. Marles has met with defence industry companies including Austal USA, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, General Dynamics, Boeing Defense and Anduril. Labor wants the respective industrial bases of the US and Australia to become increasingly seamless. Queensland’s victims commissioner quits after damning report Queensland’s victims commissioner has stepped down, after government released a damning report into an organisation she previously managed. Beck O’Connor was appointed in the role last year to represent victims of crime and make recommendations to government. On Tuesday, the minister for victim support, Laura Gerber, announced in parliament that she had resigned, effective 23 September. In her time in the role, Ms O’Connor has raised awareness of victims’ rights and ensured victims of crime have had a priority voice at the table. The Crisafulli government is committed to putting victims of crime first. The office of the victims’ commissioner is critical to identifying systemic issues relating to victims and promoting and advocating for the rights of victims. Acting arrangements will be in place to ensure continuity of important work from the office of the victims’ commissioner until a new appointment is made. O’Connor was CEO of helpline service DVConnect during a period when the government alleges, thousands of phone calls went unanswered. Send your political questions to the Back to Back Barries podcast In the wake of parliament resuming this week, do you have any burning political questions? Back to Back Barries is Guardian Australia’s political analysis podcast. Each week veteran journalist Barrie Cassidy joins former Liberal adviser and pollster Tony Barry to pull apart the strategies behind the politics. And they want to hear from you. Send your politics questions to backtobackbarries@theguardian.com and they’ll pick some to answer on this week’s episode, out this Saturday. Israel’s strike on a hospital overnight is “horrific”, says foreign affairs minister Penny Wong. The strikes killed at least 20 Palestinians including five journalists, according to health officials. Speaking to Channel 7, Wong said the Netanyahu government must agree to a ceasefire. What we’ve seen overnight with the attack on a hospital is horrific, and what we would say to prime minister Netanyahu is you should heed the call of the world and agree to a ceasefire. You should take the advice of your own military and agree to a ceasefire. Cabinet minister Murray Watt told the ABC this morning the strikes were an “outrage” and a “breach of international law”. Greens urge Labor to come clean on fossil fuel donations The Greens want Labor to explain how much the party has banked in political donations from fossil fuel companies ahead of the government announcing Australia’s 2035 emissions reduction targets, due between now and September. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said in the most recent data made public, Labor had received about $800,000 from resources companies, including in cash, subscriptions and tickets to party events. But donations data for the 2024–25 financial year, including contributions ahead of the 3 May federal election, won’t be made public until next February. That is due to the reporting lag under election law in Australia. Waters says we should know the total amount received before the new target is announced. If Labor wants to show genuine climate leadership, it must open its books now, not bury this information until 2026, otherwise Australians will rightly question who is pulling the strings. When coal and gas corporations pour big money into politics, they’re effectively given a pen to write our climate and environmental laws. That’s not democracy, that’s capture. Real climate action should be for people and [the] planet, not private profits. Business group urges Labor to commit to ambitious 75% emissions target 350 businesses are piling pressure on the government to go hard with their 2035 emissions reduction target, signing an open letter calling on Labor to commit to a 75% target. The Business for 75 group includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Canva and Ikea. Their open letter comes with new analysis from Deloitte, showing a 75% target could bring with it an increase in Australia’s GDP by $370bn by 2035. Labor is waiting for the Climate Change Authority to advise on a 2035 target. Last year, the CCA consulted industry and climate groups on a potential target in the range of 65 to 75% emissions reduction on 2005 levels. The new Deloitte analysis says a 75% target would bring forward investment of up to an additional $20bn a year to 2035 compared to a 65% target, and would increase Australia’s competitiveness overseas. Deloitte Access Economics’ lead partner, Pradeep Philip, says: Getting these foundations right with a 75% target can drive, in today’s dollars, $190bn more exports by mid-century. A Liberal senator has spoken out against a planned anti-immigration protest this Sunday. Paul Scarr, a Queensland senator, addressed parliament last night, condemning the March for Australia rallies that will take place across the country. There are nine planned protests. The flyers accuse Labor and the Liberals of being “complicit” in mass migration, and singles out an increase in migration from India. Scarr told parliament he stands in solidarity with the Indian community in Australia: I am compelled to rise in this place at the earliest opportunity to call it out and to condemn it and say that the language and references to Australians of Indian heritage is unacceptable. It is outrageous … it seeks to divide Australians at a time when we need to unite. Fewer children attending childcare provider G8, but company posts $22m profit Childcare giant G8 Education has seen profits pick up despite fewer children attending its centres, which it has blamed on cost-of-living pressures rather than child safety issues across the sector. Fewer families took up childcare spots across the company’s 399 centres in the first half of 2025 than the same period in 2024, the centre said. Children also attended slightly less frequently, which combined saw revenue slip to $465.4m but also brought down costs, meaning profits soared to $22.5m. But customer satisfaction was the more important measure, if the comments from G8’s chief executive, Pejman Okhovat, were anything to go by. He started his remarks addressing the sector’s child abuse crisis that has seen governments rush to tighten regulation, saying in a statement: We recognise that safeguarding children is not just a regulatory obligation, it is an ethical and social licence imperative. Okhovat said satisfaction and employee retention were on the rise while family inquiries for places had remained stable compared to 2024. He told investors some families were delaying starting their children at a centre early in the year. Family satisfaction slipped slightly in April but rose again by May. G8’s annual report, released this morning, read: [The] impact of [the] Victorian incident on occupancy is localised to the impacted centres thus far, and we are not seeing wider trends across the state or the network. The chief executive also highlighted that 93.7% of G8’s centres had been rated as “exceeding” or “meeting” the national quality standard, which is above average. But that implies 25 centres have not achieved either rating, with a further two yet to be rated. Coles has made more than $44bn in sales revenue and more than $1bn in net profit across its supermarkets, online grocery service, and bottle shops in the past financial year. Coles Group has just released its results for the 12 months to 30 June, with its executives expected to speak to investors and journalists from 10am AEST. Of its $44.35bn in Coles’ overall revenue, nearly $40bn was made in its supermarkets, where the group reported $39.99bn in revenue. This was a net increase of 2.4% from the year before. However, Coles says its normalised supermarket sales, which account for the 53 weeks of trading in 2024, rose by 4.3%. Its alcohol sales didn’t fare as well, with the company reporting $3.67bn in revenue across its bottle shops – a net 0.7% decrease from the year before or a modest 1.1% increase when “normalised”. While the Coles Group’s net profit fell 3.5% to $1.08bn, its normalised profit rose 2.4%. Over the past year, the supermarket giant’s practices have come under a microscope, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission scrutinised Coles and its competitors during its inquiry into the supermarkets sector. Coles and Woolworths are also in the midst of a federal court challenge launched by the ACCC, with the consumer regulator alleging the companies breached the Australian Consumer Law by misleading customers over discount pricing claims. US parcel delivery suspensions ‘a very bad sign’, Tim Wilson says We’re getting more reaction domestically to the decision by Australia Post to suspend most parcels to the US as it deals with new tariff rules. The shadow minister for small business, Tim Wilson, says the move is “very concerning” and that small businesses will be most heavily affected by the decision. He told Sky News a moment ago, he expects the government will want to quickly deal with the new rules. I suspect [Ambassador] Kevin Rudd is going to be off to the White House or the Congress pretty quick smart, because we need to make sure this relationship is sorted. Because this is a very bad sign. Australia is the latest of dozens of countries to suspend parcels being sent to the US. The government says it’s been engaging with the US to remove all tariffs – with Australia currently receiving the lowest baseline tariff of 10% on most goods exported to the US. The government says US tariffs on low value imports is “disappointing”, and will work with Australia Post to comply with the new requirements. A government spokesperson said: The United States’ decision to remove exemptions from tariffs and duties for low value imports is disappointing and will only drive up costs for American families and small businesses. The Albanese Government will work with Australia Post to limit disruption for affected customers while they make adjustments to comply with new requirements. We continue to advocate for the removal of all tariffs on Australian exports, in line with our free trade agreement. Australia Post US parcel suspension follows similar moves in Europe Australia Post’s temporary partial suspension of parcels to the US follows a similar action by dozens of other nations, in response to the new import tariffs. 1.36bn packages were sent last year under the “de minimis” exemption, for parcels worth under US$800, according to US customs. With that exception being removed, those parcels will now face a 15% tariff. You can read more about that here: When will the government announce its 2035 emissions targets? While Labor sledges the Coalition over its disunity on climate action, the government still hasn’t revealed its own 2035 emission targets, or released a long awaited climate risk report. The government is running out of time to announce a new target – and Watt says more detail will be revealed next month. But Labor is remaining tight-lipped on how ambitious that target will be. [Energy minister] Chris Bowen is doing a power of work on that at the moment, and he’s already indicated that in September, we’ll be revealing a lot more about that. Watt says government considering removing ‘duplication’ between state and federal housing approvals Murray Watt is continuing his media rounds, moving to Sky News, and says one of the red tape issues under current environment laws is where a project requires both state and federal approval. He gives an example of his recent approval of a housing development at the Queen Victoria markets in Melbourne, which he says followed years of consideration by the state government. We think that it is possible to reduce that kind of duplication in the system rather than having both levels of government double up. That would enable a much quicker approval, but at the same time, those assessments will be done against strong standards. Watt then brushes off concerns from the Nationals that some industries would get a free pass under the reforms while other industries like mining wouldn’t. We all know that the word environment is allergic to National party members. We’re seeing them run around the parliament constantly try to undermine Sussan Ley’s leadership on net zero … The sort of system that we’re looking at putting in place would treat different projects and different sectors in a very similar way. Australia Post is temporarily suspending some international parcel services to the US and Puerto Rico due to the Trump administration’s tariffs. The halt will prevent most Australian businesses from selling to US customers until a new pre-paid tariff system can be set up. From today parcels will have to detail their country of origin and a harmonised system (HS) tariff code, with tariffs on low-value parcels due to take effect within days. From Friday 29 August, parcels valued under US$800 imported into the US will attract tariffs or flat fees – where they were previously exempt. Australia Post will continue shipping letters, documents of no commercial value and gifts that are sent by individuals and are worth less than US$100. Australia Post Executive General Manager, Parcel, Post &amp; eCommerce Services, Gary Starr said in a statement: We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, joins RN Breakfast after Murray Watt, and says she welcomes the urgency of getting the EPBC legislation into parliament this year, but the Greens want to see a climate trigger. We have always said that climate should be considered by our nature laws, and you just have to look at the algal bloom in South Australia to know that you can’t consider climate and nature separately … I think it was a bit artificial to say that you’ve got other laws that deal with climate, therefore you shouldn’t have the climate impact on nature considered. Asked about streamlining the approvals process for housing under the current EPBC act, Waters says there is room for greater efficiencies in the process, but ultimately the federal government to “uphold those international conventions and standards.” Housing developers will be ‘incentivised’ to provide information for faster approvals: Watt One of the announcements from last week’s economic roundtable was the fast-tracking of up to 26,000 homes currently held up by the EPBC Act. So how will those homes actually be fast-tracked? Murray Watt tells RN Breakfast one of the problems in the system is sometimes developers don’t provide all the information they should – and if they did, a project could be approved in as little as four months. This is another measure that we’re taking within our existing resources to focus them on clearing that backlog of housing. But also what we announced over the weekend is that we want to make better use of an existing pathway under the EPBC legislation that allows for rapid assessment of projects. We want to incentivise companies to do the right thing and come to us with all of the information that’s required, and that will enable us to make a much faster assessment. EPBC reforms will be in ‘spirit’ of 2021 Samuel review, Watt says Joining ABC Radio National Breakfast, Murray Watt says the EPBC reforms will be in the “spirit” of the Graeme Samuel review of the legislation. Graeme’s report came down nearly five years ago, but it’s been nearly 20 years since there’s been any proper overhaul of these laws. They’re not working for business, they’re not working for environment. If we don’t fix these laws, we won’t get the housing we need, we won’t get the renewables we need, and we certainly will continue to see the environment suffer. To recap, here’s what Samuel recommended in his review, which he handed to the previous Coalition government in 2021: Watt says Samuel’s recommendations fall into three categories: Firstly, stronger environmental protections, secondly, quicker and more efficient approvals, and thirdly, more transparency regarding decision making on environmental regulation. There are still a lot of unknowns with the reforms – for example, Watt has promised that the government will establish a federal environmental protection agency, but he’s still consulting on what that body will look like. In the last parliament, the government had just reached a deal with the Greens and members of the crossbench, to get its environmental laws over the line. Now that they’ve had to go back to the drawing board, the Coalition and the Greens will be approached for negotiation (as Murray Watt outlined a bit earlier). On the Today show a bit earlier the Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said her party is “pretty keen” for reform, but wants those laws to focus on the climate crisis. We need laws that actually act on the climate crisis, protect nature. And of course, we will always stand for making sure everyone’s got a home, a roof over their heads in this wealthy country. So the offer’s there. We’re looking forward to those discussions with government. Or they can choose to do a deal that will just pave the way for more big business profits, trash nature and leave ordinary people behind with the Libs. Gaza hospital strike a ‘breach of international law’: Watt Murray Watt says the government condemns the double bombing of a Gaza hospital which killed 20 people, including five journalists, according to local health officials. Watt says: It’s very clear that targeting or hitting hospitals, health workers and civilians is a breach of international law. We join with the rest of the international community in condemning this action. He’s asked on News Breakfast whether the government will place more sanctions on members of the Israeli government, but Watt won’t say. He repeats lines the prime minister has said, that the government has already applied sanctions to some individuals in the Israeli government. The environment minister, Murray Watt, says there hasn’t yet been a deal reached on critical environment laws but the government is “a lot closer than we were and have been for many years”. The government planned to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) act in the last parliamentary term under the then environment minister, Tanya Plibersek – but that deal was scuttled at the 11th hour. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, he says: We have committed today to bring forward by several months the introduction of this legislation, we’ll be introducing it to the parliament this side of Christmas, and we certainly will be seeking the support from both the coalition and the Greens to deliver these reforms. A big sticking point for the Greens and some independents is a climate trigger – which would require the act to take into consideration the climate impact of a proposed project before approving it. Watt says the government hasn’t “settled on a position” on that issue. I would point out, Graham Samuel in his review [of the EPBC act] did not recommend a climate trigger. He expressly ruled that out. What he recommended is companies when they’re putting forward projects for approval, should disclose their emissions and what their plans are to reduce their emissions going forward. Aukus ‘really critical for decades to come’, Rishworth says, despite US review Aukus is still critical for Australia, cabinet minister Amanda Rishworth says, as the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, meets with his defence counterpart in the US. The US is currently reviewing the Aukus deal, with a report due by the end of the year. Rishworth is on the Today show and says Marles is working “very hard” with his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, and that there is bipartisan support for the security pact. Our three countries – the US, UK and Australia – have been committed to this arrangement. It is really critical for decades to come. Rishworth is joined by the Greens leader, Larissa Waters, who is far less enthusiastic about the pact. (The Greens have been highly critical of Aukus since its announcement). This is a dog of a deal for submarines that we may never receive anyway. It’s costing us an absolute motza. Good morning! Krishani Dhanji here with you, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started. Murray Watt is doing the media rounds this morning – he’s planning to put major environment reforms to parliament this year. (You can read more about the EPBC changes here). The chambers will be sitting a bit later this morning, because we have party room meetings – where party leaders will give their colleagues a bit of a gee up and they’ll discuss what policies they want to put forward or support over the sitting fortnight. It’s going to be a busy one, so let’s get going! Single Mother Families Australia calls for safety supplement for women who have experienced intimate partner violence Single mothers are carrying “herculean” emotional and financial burdens that are even more intense if they have fled domestic violence, Single Mother Families Australia (SMFA) says. A Swinburne University survey carried out for SMFA of 2,600 women found nearly seven in 10 had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) and nearly one in five were currently experiencing it. Of those, about one in three were experiencing financial abuse or coercive control. Almost four in five single mothers spend a lot or almost all of their time worrying about their family’s finances. SMFA says mothers are not only managing their own recovery, they are also supporting children who were themselves victim/survivors, a burden of unpaid work that is “largely invisible to government policy and family violence services”. SMFA is calling for measures including a $23,000 safety supplement paid in instalments via Family Tax Benefit A for women who have experienced IPV, a significant reform of the child support system, which allows perpetrators to continue abuse after separation, and an increase in the amount and duration of parenting payments. One mother told the survey: “Fleeing domestic violence can leave you financially crippled, and systems can make it worse. It takes over a decade to build back up from nothing. Parents who care for children deserve a living wage and superannuation top-ups.” Senator David Pocock has renewed his call for sanctions against Israel after the country’s latest attack on a hospital, a “double tap” strike that our correspondent in the region says bears many of the hallmarks of a war crime. Pocock wrote on X: Attacking health infrastructure, killing journalists, starving children – how many more flagrant breaches of international law will governments tolerate before sanctioning PM Netanyahu and stopping trade with Israel? As the Albanese government tries to curb the cost of the NDIS, a Coalition MP and father of an autistic child has spoken out about how he was in “two minds” about the reform, Australian Associated Press reports. Parents reacted with shock when the federal government announced last week a new scheme called Thriving Kids to serve as a cheaper alternative to the $44bn NDIS. Phil Thompson, the MP for Herbert, said “it pains me to my heart” that families feel like their children are an inconvenient dollar figure on a government’s budget bottom line. I know that reform is needed. I get that. I understand it, but it must be done in a way where participants aren’t waking up in the morning finding out that things have changed. The Coalition’s assistant NDIS spokesperson is the father of Emery, a five-year-old with autism. “Changes that get made quickly, changes that get made without consultation or minimal consultation, terrifies me as a father, terrifies me for my daughter’s future,” Thompson said. I’m not the only person in this parliament or this country that is looking at the changes to the NDIS with lots of fear. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has warned the states and territories could lose billions of dollars in extra funding for hospitals over five years if they failed to back his government’s plan. Thriving Kids will be rolled out from July 2026 and be fully implemented by July 2027. The Albanese government will invest $30m to lift the number of electrical and construction teachers in the VET system, the minister for skills and training, Andrew Giles, says. Giles, in a speech to be delivered to the National Press Club later today, will say that “equally valuing VET’ will be one of three priorities in this term of government. “Nine out of 10 new jobs will require some form of tertiary education, approximately half VET and half higher education,” he will say. “We will only achieve the national goal of four in five Australians holding a Tafe qualification or a university degree if we break down that artificial barrier between vocational and higher education.” Giles will say another priority in this term of government will be promoting lifelong learning, a key area identified by participants at the recent economic reform roundtable. “It’s the concept that knits together how we should be thinking about supporting people to navigate a changing world, on their terms. “In the context of generative AI, and indeed more generally, we are witnessing changes in demand for skills and [we] should anticipate this accelerating.” Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji takes the controls. The skills minister, Andrew Giles, will tell the National Press Club today that the Albanese government is planning to invest $30m to lift the number of people who teach electrical and construction skills in the VET system. He will also flag the government’s plans to promote more lifelong learning. More details in a moment. As the Albanese government tries to find ways to curb the cost of the $44bn-a-year NDIS, a Liberal politician and father of an autistic child said he was in “two minds” about the changes and that it “pains him that families feel their children are ‘inconvenient’”.
