  A recent study has shown that more than 3.7 million Brits over 45 go raving
  once a week, an activity usually associated with younger crowds. But with the
  UK nightlife industry struggling with rising costs and falling attendees (in
  2013, the UK had 1,700 nightclubs. By June 2024 there were fewer than half as
  many, just 787), might older clubbers be the saviour of the UK club scene? If
  you’re someone over the age of 40 who regularly goes clubbing, we’d love to
  hear from you. Are you new to the scene or keeping the thrill of your younger
  years alive? What do you love about it and who do you go with? Which clubs do
  you prefer going to? Clubs with younger people alongside, or daytime raves
  designed for your age group? And ultimately, who should nightclubs be for? Do
  you as a middle-aged raver feel welcomed in the nightlife scene? If you’re
