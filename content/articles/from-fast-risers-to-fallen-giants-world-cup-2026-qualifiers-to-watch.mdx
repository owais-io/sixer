  Suriname v Panama There are only three automatic places available via the
  Concacaf World Cup qualifiers because the USA, Mexico and Canada have secured
  their spots as hosts, although the two best runners-up head into the
  inter-confederation playoffs. Suriname have made it to the final round of
  qualifying only once before and will be hoping to kick off their campaign with
  a victory when they host Panama in Paramaribo on Thursday. Managed by the
  former Netherlands goalkeeper Stanley Menzo, they have been steadily climbing
  Fifa’s rankings since allowing players born in the Netherlands with Surinamese
  heritage to represent the national side and have the Huddersfield defender
  Radinio Balker in their ranks. Jamaica v Trinidad and Tobago Steve McClaren’s
  side won an entertaining friendly against Trinidad and Tobago at Brentford’s
  Gtech Community Stadium at the end of May in the Unity Cup but things will get
  much more serious when the sides meet again in Kingston on Wednesday. They
  have both qualified for the World Cup once before – Jamaica in 1998 and
  Trinidad and Tobago in 2006 – and stand a chance of grabbing top spot in a
  group that also includes Curaçao and Bermuda. Jamaica, who face the latter
  first on Friday, are the favourites to progress given they are the
  highest-ranked team at 70th, but the Trinidad manager, Dwight Yorke, would
  love to get one over on his former coach at Manchester United. Colombia v
  Bolivia It has been 31 years since Bolivia won in Colombia and they need a
  repeat on Friday to keep alive any hopes of qualifying automatically. With two
  rounds to play of the mammoth 18-match Conmebol schedule, Colombia will be
  guaranteed a place in the finals, after failing to make it in 2022, if they
  can win in Barranquilla, although a draw could be enough if Venezuela do not
  win in Argentina on the same evening. Bolivia’s best hope may be reaching the
  inter-confederation playoffs by finishing seventh. They host already qualified
  Brazil in their final match on Wednesday. Uruguay v Peru A draw for Marcelo
  Bielsa’s Uruguay would secure a fifth straight qualification for the World
  Cup, although they will be without Federico Valverde and Darwin Núñez for the
  meeting with Peru on Friday in Montevideo. Peru know only a victory will keep
  alive their chances of finishing seventh and they are also relying on Bolivia
  and Venezuela to slip up. The former Newcastle player Nolberto Solano scored
  the last time Peru beat Uruguay away, in 2004, and they will hope to set up a
  grand finale against Paraguay in the last round of fixtures. Paraguay v
  Ecuador At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Paraguay were knocked out in
  the quarter-finals by David Villa’s dramatic goal seven minutes from time and
  they haven’t been back since. That looks set to change despite the manager,
  Gustavo Alfaro, presiding over defeat to Brazil in June. La Albirroja have the
  opportunity to seal their qualification in Asunción on Friday when they face
  Ecuador, whom Alfaro managed at the last World Cup. Sebastián Beccacece’s team
  have booked their place for next year but are hoping to hold off Brazil for
  second place in the Conmebol table and will be no pushovers. Israel v Italy
  The new Azzurri manager, Gennaro Gattuso, who was appointed after Luciano
  Spalletti was sacked in June, faces an uphill battle to revive their hopes of
  qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 2014 when he begins his
  tenure against Estonia on Friday. The Nagyerdei Stadion in the Hungarian city
  of Debrecen will host Italy’s qualifier against Israel on Monday before the
  sides are scheduled to meet again in Udine next month in a fixture that the
  city’s mayor has called to be postponed over security concerns. Gattuso needs
  two victories in the international window to give his side a fighting chance
  of overhauling Norway, who go for a fifth qualifying win in a row against
  Moldova on Tuesday. Hungary v Portugal Six of the groups in European
  qualifying contain only four countries so there is no room for mistakes when
  the teams begin their campaigns this week. Tuesday’s meeting between Dominik
  Szoboszlai’s Hungary and a star-studded Portugal side still boasting the
  40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo is the most eye-catching match of the first two
  rounds this week. Hungary haven’t qualified for the World Cup since 1986 and
  have high hopes of ending their long wait in a group that also contains the
  Republic of Ireland and Armenia. Marco Rossi’s side travel to Dublin on
  Saturday before the showdown in Budapest. Egypt v Burkina Faso The Pharaohs
  powered their way to the top of their Caf qualifying group with five wins and
  a draw from their opening six games and look poised to seal qualification for
  only the third time. After hosting Ethiopia on Friday, Egypt must travel to
  Ouagadougou to play their chief rivals, Burkina Faso, and they know two wins
  would be enough. Mohamed Salah – who in his only previous appearance at the
  World Cup in 2018 had just returned from injury after clashing with Sergio
  Ramos in the Champions League final – will want to ensure they make it this
  time having seen Sadio Mané’s Senegal beat them in a penalty shootout in a
  playoff three years ago. South Africa v Nigeria Pressure is mounting on
  Nigeria after a poor start to their qualifying campaign. They missed out in
  2022 and go into the seventh round of games with only one victory. The Super
  Eagles have drawn all three home games 1-1 and must beat Rwanda in Uyo on
  Saturday before a showdown with the group leaders, South Africa, three days
  later in Bloemfontein. However, Fifa is yet to decide what punishment to
  impose on Bafana Bafana for fielding Teboho Mokoena – who should have been
  suspended for picking up two yellow cards in previous matches – when they beat
  Lesotho in March. Cape Verde v Cameroon The Blue Sharks have made astonishing
  progress since reaching the quarter-finals on their African Nations Cup debut
  in 2013 and are in a great position to qualify for their first World Cup. They
  have a one-point advantage over Cameroon in Group D and welcome the
  Indomitable Lions, who are hoping to make it to their ninth finals, on Tuesday
  in Praia after travelling to Mauritius. Libya and Angola are not out of it
  given that the four best second-placed teams in Africa’s nine groups will face
  off to be the continent’s sole representatives in the inter-confederation
  playoffs.
