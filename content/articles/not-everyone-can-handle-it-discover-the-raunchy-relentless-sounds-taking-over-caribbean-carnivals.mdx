  At this year’s Fête de la Musique in Paris, British ravers who had streamed
  over to enjoy the annual street party – think Notting Hill carnival without
  the procession – found themselves hearing, and then swiftly dancing to, a
  wildly uptempo tune called Bouwéy. Built from a languid vocal at odds with
  clattering African percussion, the track bowled out from sound systems and car
  windows, quite unlike anything else: a defining song of the summer. Made by
  Guadeloupean act 1T1, Bouwéy has now hit 12m views on YouTube. But its
  frenetic pace and startling synth work haven’t arrived in a vacuum – instead
  it is the vanguard of a sound known as bouyon, part of a whirlwind of dance
  genres leaping out from the Caribbean to the world, including at Notting Hill
  carnival this weekend. “The bouyon is a faster riddim,” chuckles Hillary
  “Tilly” Thomas over the phone. “You have to drink some rum – it’s carnival
  music, not everyone can handle it. You have to be crazy!” Tilly, a mainstay in
  the bouyon scene since the 00s, now manages rising Dominican star DJ Taffy:
  countless vocalists have hopped on to his frenetic, warbling instrumental
  Funny Riddim. “Bouyon is a Dominican French word meaning a mixture of foods,”
  Tilly says. “Let’s say you’re cooking; you put yam, banana, chicken, fish,
  dumpling with all the seasonings, it’s an all in one dish. So the music is a
  fusion of African beats, soca, EDM, the Haitian music kompa, French music and
  calypso. Like the food, we put it all together to make one pot, it’s a fusion
  of all Caribbean music. And then it has the ‘dom dom dom’” – he makes the
  unmistakable sound of a thudding kick drum. “That’s how you know it’s bouyon.”
  It’s the genre’s sexualised lyrics – known as “nasty business” in Dominica –
  that have really turned heads, though, delighting young fans but also
  dismaying Caribbean radio station bosses. “The nastiness [paired] with the
  pulsating rhythm, it really and truly brought the music to the world,” Tilly
  says. “Controversy sells! With only 44 million people spread across its
  islands, the Caribbean has had an extraordinarily disproportionate impact on
  music around the globe. Often western media will use Jamaican culture as
  interchangeable with that of the whole Caribbean, and while reggae and
  dancehall remain in rude health, their international acclaim can obscure the
  fact that the other islands have been gestating their own styles for decades.
  Tilly is at pains to point out that bouyon is not new – he mentions 90s big
  bands such as WCK and Triple 0 as laying the groundwork, followed by 2010s
  breakthrough acts such as Asa Bantan and the producer Arade Moses, who has
  acted as mentor for DJ Taffy. But something has changed since 2020: cheap
  production technology, the availability of low cost digital distribution
  (along with the late arrival of Spotify to the Caribbean in 2021), and the
  rise of TikTok have all conspired to push these high tempo styles into the
  limelight. This has spread beyond bouyon. In St Lucia, the local variant of
  the sound is known as dennery segment, the name deriving from the village
  Dennery where many of the artists originated. Over the last year, scene leader
  Bozo, who produces under the name of Bad Sound, has had tracks such as Both
  Twanche Riddim Refix played everywhere from St Lucian raves to London’s
  tastemaking NTS Radio. He also attributes this newfound success to his ability
  to blend different styles: the Both Twanche remix fuses dennery segment with
  the insistent house music of New Jersey, along with a sample from Portuguese
  producer DJ Marfox. While to the uninitiated dennery may sound like a
  hyperspeed cousin of soca – the already rapidly undulating iteration of
  calypso – Bozo points to Africa as the prime source of inspiration. “Kuduro is
  the bigger influence,” he tells me, referring to the similarly high tempo
  Angolan dance style. “We try to merge other genres together.” This magpie mix
  of styles, frenetic pace, and scandalous lyrics has made bouyon and dennery
  the perfect soundtrack for TikTok’s attention grabbing accounts. But as kids
  from London, Paris and New York have started tuning in to the sound, not
  everyone at home has been quick to welcome the success. “There was a point in
  time,” Bozo recalls, “when the radio stations wanted to ban the genre because
  they said it was too explicit. Then when the songs started blowing up, they
  thought: ‘OK, maybe we’ll give it a try.’ Now we embrace it as our own. Social
  media has played a big part.” For his part, Tilly thinks that the use of
  explicit lyrics was just a stepping stone to breaking through to a wider
  audience. “I told the guys making it: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll take the blame for
  the lyrics.’ We used the nasty business to get the music out in the world. Now
  we’ve done that, we’re back making real bouyon; love songs, serious songs.” He
  may be right. The success of a lyrically PG track such as Bouwéy has proved
  that controversial lyrics aren’t needed for success, and the producer Arade
  Moses, on the line with Tilly, is certain. “We always knew it would go
  somewhere,” he says. “It’s so energy-driven, and the way the youth react to it
  is so different. True bouyon is too melodic to be stopped!”
