  After a strenuous day of running or hiking, there’s nothing quite like
  slipping your aching feet out of muddy shoes and into a breezy pair of
  sandals. From Nike and Adidas slides to Chacos and Birkenstocks, I’ve churned
  through many styles and brands. But now I think I’ve finally found a pair
  that’ll last me a lifetime – the Xero Genesis. With an unprecedented
  5,000-mile guarantee, these barefoot sandals are built for the long haul. I’ve
  been wearing a pair of Genesis for two years now, taking them on trips around
  the globe and racking up thousands of miles. Despite their light weight and
  minimalist design, they’ve held up remarkably well. And at just $45, they’re a
  shockingly affordable investment for anyone seeking a durable, travel-friendly
  pair of sandals that aren’t destined for the trash in a few years. Better than
  Birkenstocks I’ve been known to blow through a pair of sandals in less than a
  year, so Xero’s 5,000-mile warranty piqued my interest. I loved my old
  Birkenstocks, but wearing them in water isn’t recommended, and the weather
  (and beaches) of Charleston, South Carolina, eventually got the best of them.
  My Chacos were a bit more versatile, but the straps quickly began to fray and
  the soles began to crack – allowing water to seep inside and greet me with a
  lovely squeak as I walked. $44.99 at Nordstrom (men’s) $44.99 at Nordstrom
  (women’s) The Xero Genesis have no such caveats. Whether hiking around
  Boulder, Colorado, exploring the Sonoran desert near Tucson, or wading into
  alpine lakes in the Rocky Mountains, my Genesis sandals have never
  disappointed me. After all those miles, the polyester cord shows no signs of
  fraying, and the rubber sole has no chips, rips, or tears. While there’s
  (finally) a bit of wear on the tread, they’re still perfectly grippy and
  capable of handling terrain from trails to beaches. For a $45 pair of sandals,
  I’m mighty impressed. More is less Unlike a chunky Birkenstock, the Genesis is
  a “barefoot” sandal. That means they offer no cushioning, putting your foot as
  close to the earth as possible. Personally, I love the fit, which is a welcome
  relief after hours of running or hiking in ultra-supportive shoes. They also
  help develop different muscles in your feet – though this entails a bit of
  acclimation. And while I use them for serious hiking, something with more
  cushioning would be a better choice if you’ll be trekking across rough terrain
  – the limited underfoot padding isn’t ideal for jagged rocks. Here’s the fine
  print on the 5,000-mile warranty: Xero will give you a 60% discount on
  replacements if you manage to grind the soles down to less than 1mm. Mine
  still measure about 3mm at the absolute thinnest. On top of that, Xero layers
  on a 24-month manufacturer’s warranty, offering a full replacement if you
  experience a manufacturing defect within that timeframe. After two years of
  flogging mine, I can’t imagine many people will make use of either. Staying
  out of a landfill for 5,000 miles is one way Xero reduces its environmental
  footprint, but they also carefully source material, and use less of it. Xero’s
  Restricted Substances Test Protocol outlines testing and limits for the use of
  everything from Pfas “forever chemicals” to lead, and Genesis’s minimalist
  design means there’s no need for materials like foam midsoles. Less shoe, less
  waste. Other Xero models also make use of sustainable materials like hemp,
  coffee carbon fiber and recycled polyethylene. The Xero Genesis are probably
  the best pair of sandals I’ve owned, and a staple of my year-round wardrobe.
  For all but the rockiest of conditions, the lightweight barefoot sandals are a
  wonderful fit for anything life throws your way. Specifications Type:
  Huaraches Weight: 4.6oz per sandal (size 9) Colors: Stone, sand, black,
  raspberry, lake blue, sea moss Materials: Rubber sole, polyester cord Jon
