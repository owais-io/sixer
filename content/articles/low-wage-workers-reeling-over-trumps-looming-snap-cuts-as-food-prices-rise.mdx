  Poverty and hunger will rise as a result of the Trump administration’s
  unprecedented cuts to the US federal “food stamps” program, according to
  experts. Low-income workers who rely on the aid are braced for dire
  consequences. Katie Giede, a single mother and waitress in Conyers, Georgia,
  is one of the 42 million Americans who use the supplemental nutrition
  assistance program (Snap). Even with the maximum benefit permitted, she
  struggles to afford food for her and her child. She makes $3 an hour plus tips
  at the fast-food chain Waffle House, where she has worked for 11 years. The
  company deducts meals from workers’ pay check per shift, regardless of whether
  they eat one or not. “Our pay is already so little that we’re struggling with
  everything,” Giede told the Guardian. “Single mothers like myself are reliant
  upon the benefits like Snap and Medicaid. So when you go and you cut that as
  well, now you have mothers out here that are not only worried at night because
  they already can’t afford housing or a vehicle, but we’re also worried what is
  our kid is going to eat? Because we no longer have help.” Giede said she
  received $450 a month for her and her child. She said working too many hours
  or receiving too much income was a constant concern, due to eligibility
  cut-offs. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, at the end of 2024,
  even the maximum Snap benefit would not cover the cost of a modestly priced
  meal in 99% of all counties in the US. “I dread that trip to the grocery store
  every week, because you have to sit down and you really have to budget,” said
  Giede. “Every time you go, you’re having to make the choice between something
  that’s healthy or something that’s cheaper, just so you can get enough to last
  all week. “There are so many people in this country that rely on these
  benefits, and with these cuts, half of the people that are surviving right now
  off of this are going to lose their benefits. That’s not even just people not
  eating a little bit. They’re already not eating enough, so we’re going to lose
  lives over this. It’s those of us at the bottom that are really feeling it.”
  Waffle House did not respond to multiple requests for comment. *** Trump’s
  “big, beautiful bill” set the stage for significant cuts to Snap by shifting
  higher administrative costs to each state, expanding work reporting
  requirements and imposing restrictions on non-citizen eligibility. Many
  lower-wage workers have grown more reliant on Snap in recent years. US food
  prices rose by 23.6% between 2020 and 2024, according to official data. While
  inflation has since moderated, grocery costs remain high. As a result of the
  latest Snap changes, states will be responsible for 75% of administrative
  costs of handling the program from 2027, up from 50% cost-sharing with the
  federal government, which is likely to strain state budgets. From 2028, for
  the first time states will be forced to pick up some of the
  multibillion-dollar bill for Snap benefits. The state of New York, for
  example, faces a budget impact of about $1.2bn, according to the Food Research
  and Action Center (Frac), a non-profit advocacy group. While such shifting
  costs have raised fears that states will cut back Snap support, expanded work
  requirements have sparked concern that few people will be eligible. Analysis
  by the Urban Institute found about 22.3 million US families are set to lose
  some or all of their Snap benefits. “This is a very targeted, well-thought-out
  plan of dismantling the Snap program that federal policy makers won’t take
  responsibility for, because it is the states, it is the governors who will
  have to cut resources for Snap, who will have to cut the program in order to
  say we can’t operate this because of what’s happening at the federal level,”
  said Gina Plata-Nino, Snap deputy director at the Frac. “Snap is a very
  important ecosystem at the local level, at the state level and the federal
  level, because billions of dollars go into states, and this federal money
  supports local economies,” she added. “All of these proposals threaten this
  very delicate balance.” The White House deferred comment to the office of
  management and budget, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
  States across the US are braced for stark consequences. “We’re going to have
  worse hunger and ultimately, worse poverty,” said Seth DiStefano, policy
  outreach director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. “There are
  entire regions of West Virginia where there aren’t 20 hours a week [expanded
  Snap work requirement] of anything to apply for. What do you tell those
  families? “We’re talking families with kids now that are going to be subjected
  to these harsh work reporting requirements. We’re talking folks in their 60s,
  literally in communities where there are no jobs, none, and ripping away the
  one outlet to their basic needs that’s available to them.” Among the employers
  with the most workers reliant on Snap is Walmart, the largest private employer
  in the US, as much of its workforce receives only part-time hours. Christina
  Gahagan, 66, has worked at Walmart for a decade in western New York at several
  stores. She is currently based at a store in Geneseo, New York. “I would say
  at least 50% of the people in my store rely on food stamps to make ends meet
  for their families,” said Gahagan. “They’re always trying to figure out where
  the best deals are, coupon clipping at lunch and reading circulars to see
  who’s got the best deal on whatever, just to make their money stretch.” She
  has cut down on costly grocery items, eating cheaper junk food to get by. “I
  was paying $9 a pound for roast beef. Today it’s almost $13 a pound. So I’m
  not buying full pounds any more. I’m just buying a half a pound and making it
  work and just eating crap in between, like buying myself some chips out of the
  vending machine or something,” Gahagan said. “Walmart is the largest employer
  in the US. We rival Amazon almost dollar for dollar in what we do. You would
  think a company like that could shell out a little bit more money per hour for
  associates in the store across the board, so that there aren’t people who are
  having to depend so heavily on public assistance.” Walmart did not respond to
  multiple requests for comment.
