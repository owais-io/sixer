  Down with reclining seats in airplanes! Or, more to the point, up with them.
  Please sit up straight and pay attention while I make this very serious
  in-flight announcement: the airline industry should prevent all seats in basic
  economy from reclining until the general public has shown they know how to use
  them responsibly. And by “use them responsibly” I mean: don’t recline. Or, if
  you must, do so courteously and not for the entire flight. Now, I understand a
  blanket ban might not be a popular solution. But it is the fairest and most
  utilitarian approach; whatever small degree of comfort you may achieve by
  being able to lean back a few inches is outweighed by the misery you inflict
  on the person behind you. Particularly if said person is trying to work on a
  laptop, eat a meal or nap on their tray table. As you may have guessed, I am
  “said person”. Excuse me for airing my first world problems, but I recently
  had a miserable flight from London to Philadelphia because the person in front
  of me reclined as soon as we took off, and jiggled around violently in their
  seat for the next seven hours as if they had bedbugs. A model of
  passive-aggressive restraint, I didn’t go any further than muttering loudly.
  But if the trip had been any longer, there might have been an in-flight
  incident. There have already been numerous air rage episodes sparked by
  reclining seats. A couple of months ago, a Delta Air Lines passenger was
  allegedly punched in the chest because of a reclining seat altercation. Along
  with alcohol, seat angles seem to be one of the largest contributing factors
  to trouble at 30,000ft. With air rage incidents on the rise in the US, surely
  a ban is a no-brainer. Speaking of no-brainers, this feels like a job for
  Donald Trump. The Trump administration recently took management of Union
  Station, Washington’s main railway terminal, away from Amtrak. Surely our dear
  leader now needs to show the airlines who is boss? Trump has the power to fix
  our reclining seat crisis with just one phone call. Use that power, Mr
  President: bring peace to the Middle Seat. It may well be the thing that gets
  you a Nobel peace prize. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist
