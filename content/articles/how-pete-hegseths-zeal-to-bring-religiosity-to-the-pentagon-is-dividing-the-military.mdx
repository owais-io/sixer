  While secretary of defense Pete Hegseth’s links to an extremist church and
  crusader tattoos caused a stir during his confirmation hearings, the former
  Fox &amp; Friends host is now openly bringing his ultra-conservative brand of
  christianity to the Pentagon. Veterans tell the Guardian that Hegseth’s
  religiosity – rubbing off in new recruitment ads and official US Department of
  Defense social media activities – is dividing the ranks and doing untold
  damage to the future of the US military. In one of the Pentagon’s latest
  videos that it posted on X – with the message: “We Are One Nation Under God” –
  paratroopers are seen dropping from the back of airplanes as soldiers in full
  tactical gear aim assault rifles at an unknown enemy somewhere in the whirling
  sands of what looks like the Middle East. “I pursued my enemies and overtook
  them,” text from the book of Psalms appears across the screen as the scene
  unfolds in a desert resembling where medieval crusaders once fought. “I did
  not turn back till they were destroyed.” Days before the ad was posted,
  Hegseth, on his personal account, reposted a CNN segment about pastor Doug
  Wilson – Hegseth is a congregant at one of Wilson’s churches – with the quote
  “All of Christ for All of Life”, a slogan for embracing christianity in every
  facet of society (including government). In the original report, Wilson
  contends that women should not have the right to vote. Many critics saw the
  post as showcasing Hegseth’s own pitiful track record with feminism and
  undermining promises he made to Senator Joni Ernst to champion women in
  uniform. The Pentagon would not respond to questions about its biblically
  inspired recruitment ads or its use of christianity on social media, but chief
  spokesman Sean Parnell did say Hegseth is an unashamed backer of Wilson. “The
  Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of
  Reformed Evangelical Churches, which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” said
  Parnell in a statement to the Guardian. “The Secretary very much appreciates
  many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.” Mike Pruitt, a navy veteran and
  Democrat congressional candidate in Virginia who is trying to flip a red seat
  that includes the town of Charlottesville – the site of the infamous and
  racist Unite the Right rally in 2017 – said the secretary of defense is sowing
  discord among the troops. “I have certainly heard from friends of mine who are
  still in service expressing frustration about the way that their role is being
  cast as political,” said Pruitt, who served in the US navy for eight years.
  “It is not their job to speak out and therefore, that kind of concern and
  frustration within active service right now, folks on the ground, is just
  completely invisible to the media narrative.” Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war
  veteran and the CEO of non-profit watchdog Task Force Butler, which
  investigates extremism in the ranks, agreed with Pruitt and said he’s already
  felt the divisions Hegseth’s beliefs have inspired among members of the
  military. “Every time Hegseth does one of these things, I’m getting messages
  from active duty troops, reaching out to me more and more, saying ‘How do I
  get involved?’,” said Goldsmith, referring to the work his organization has
  done to out neo-Nazis and far-right links in the military community. “We’ve
  got active-duty troops who recognize that the military they’re serving in, has
  become a threat to democracy.” Outside of the “anti-war protesters during the
  Bush era”, Goldsmith says he has not seen this level of resistance to Pentagon
  policies amongst the military and veteran community, “in the last 20 years”.
  Another veteran who spoke with the Guardian also similarly quipped that
  Hegseth’s antics were seen as “cringe” among soldiers still in uniform. But
  the Pentagon, which was facing a recruitment shortfall and new lows in
  enlistments before the second Trump administration took power, has said its
  reinvigorated campaigns under Hegseth have already led to a surge in numbers –
  something Goldsmith said was unsurprising and telling of the times. “We’re
  gonna see a lot of christian nationalists join the military,” he said.
  “They’re not gonna perform very well, and our national security will suffer
  for a generation for it, because those that don’t wash out will be toxic
  leaders.” Goldsmith continued: “They won’t be able to develop the next
  generation of troops that follow, and that is going to have a disastrous
  effect on the United States and on the global stage.” Pruitt, who said his two
  central guiding identities are being an American who serves his country and a
  practising Christian, explained that Hegseth’s view of faith is rooted in a
  toxic machismo and not all in the inclusive teachings of Jesus. Instead, the
  congressional candidate believes the current head of the DoD is using religion
  to fuel his megalomania. “The man has all his ‘deus vult’ tattoos and his
  hospitaller crosses because he wants to imagine himself as the picture book
  hero, as the knight,” said Pruitt. “That is not what our military is, that is
  not what our country is, and that is not what the Christian mission is.”
  Responding to the January 6 attacks on Capitol Hill that saw hundreds of
  active duty or former US servicemen caught participating, Joe Biden made it
  one of his first policy initiatives to tackle extremism among government
  workers and specifically, in the military. His secretary of defense, Lloyd
  Austin, issued a historic “stand-down order” in February 2021, making
  servicemen across the military reflect on the issue of extremism followed by
  rolling out expanded guidelines on what constitutes extremist activities while
  in uniform, policing of soldiers’ social media accounts and new recruitment
  requirements. Sitting Republicans and talking heads on Fox News, where Hegseth
  was once a weekend host of Fox &amp; Friends for several years, seized on the
  initiative as a recruitment killer and politicized what was a verifiably
  historical and dangerous problem that continues to plague the US military. As
  soon as he took the reins of the Pentagon, Hegseth went about rooting out
  thousands of transgender troops and firing senior female service members and
  high ranking officers of color, all the while preaching that his department
  will no longer be “woke” Transgender troops “being forced out in the middle of
  their service and denied their retirement benefits is not something that makes
  our country stronger,” said Pruitt, “which I think is fundamentally the
  mission of the secretary of defense _ is to actually make our country stronger
  and more safe.”
