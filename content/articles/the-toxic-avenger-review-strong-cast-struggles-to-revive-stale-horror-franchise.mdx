  The Toxic Avenger review – strong cast struggles to revive stale horror
  franchise

  The 1980s schlock-splatterfest franchise, originating from the famously
  low-budget, low-morale Z-list horror studio Troma, is now rebooted with an
  impressive cast and unimpressive script; it gets its somewhat delayed UK
  premiere at Edinburgh, after screeningat a couple of film festivals in 2023.
  The original film was about a cringing nerd, sexually humiliated by
  bikini-clad women and brutalised by jocks, who then falls into a bin of
  bubbling toxic waste and is transformed into a hideously disfigured bulbous
  monster wreaking a terrible vengeance on all the bullies. This new version is
  not more progressive exactly, but the scantily-clad-babe factor, so important
  in bargain-bin 80s movies, has been dialled down. Now it is Peter Dinklage as
  our antihero, playing Winston, a humble janitor at a creepy corporation
  pumping out the poisonous waste – although Dinklage only has to act as himself
  in the film’s initial scenes. After the big transformation it’s another actor
  body-doubling his part in a green monster suit while Dinklage phones in his
  dialogue from the voice studio. Jacob Tremblay plays Winston’s poignantly
  lonely and vulnerable teen son Wade (another factor that the 1980s original
  did not consider relevant or necessary) while Taylour Paige plays heroine JJ
  Doherty, who is out to take down the amoral corporation led by a slimy
  plutocrat, gamely played by Kevin Bacon with much panto villainy. He has a
  submissive brother-slash-helpmeet resembling the animated baddie Gru, played
  by Elijah Wood, and his uptight office assistant is played by Julia Davis.
  However this solid roster of acting talent can’t do much about how frankly
  uninteresting and unfunny The Toxic Avenger is most of the time. As satire or
  spoof of both superhero movies and scary movies it is abysmally obsolete, and
  on its own terms as horror-comedy it achieves neither scares nor laughs. But
  in fairness, there are some good gags in Sunil Patel’s cameo as a sorrowing
  doctor who has to break the news to Winston about his condition. • The Toxic
  Avenger screened at the Edinburgh film festival, and is in Australian cinemas
  from 28 August and UK and Irish cinemas from 29 August.
