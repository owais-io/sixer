  On 2 July, the jury delivered a guilty verdict on some of the charges against
  the music mogul Sean Combs, accused of horrific sexual abuse of women with the
  help of his extensive staff and deep pockets. He’s also accused in many civil
  suits of sexual abuse of adults and minors. It seems like everyone promptly
  forgot about Combs when the facts about the financier Jeffrey Epstein’s
  decades of horrific sexual abuse of at least a 100 girls and women, with the
  help of his extensive staff, deep pockets, banks, and elite connections became
  the next front-page ruckus. In June, the movie producer Harvey Weinstein was
  found guilty in a New York retrial for some of his decades of horrific sexual
  abuse of women, with the help of his extensive staff, top lawyers, the film
  industry, some ex-Mossad agents and of course his deep pockets. In February a
  federal appeals court upheld the convictions and 30-year prison sentence of
  the singer R Kelly for racketeering and sex trafficking; last year his other
  20-year sentence was also upheld, for producing child abuse images and
  enticement of children for sex. Of course his deep pockets and extensive
  assistance had also been factors in how he too was able to abuse girls for so
  long. One of the reasons the epidemic of violence against women is so
  unacknowledged is because cases like these are talked about individually, and
  often treated as though they are shocking aberrations rather than part of a
  pervasive pattern that operates at all levels of society. Another is that it
  is in the most literal sense not news – there are tides of hatred and violence
  against other groups that ebb and flow, but violence against women is global
  and enduring, a constant rather than an event. Another is that law enforcement
  and the legal system have often been more interested in protecting
  perpetrators and society has often normalized and even celebrated violence
  against women. Imagine that we had no word for cancer and no recognition of
  the varieties of ways it manifests, so that we just had occasional lurid news
  stories about strange and sometimes fatal growths in various parts of various
  people, not connecting the versions in brains to the versions in prostates and
  breasts. If we didn’t recognize the common denominators, we couldn’t develop
  diagnoses and treatments or address root causes. Feminism has in fact offered
  a diagnosis, steadily, for decades and centuries: that the cause is misogyny
  and the violence is intended to perpetrate the inequality, exploitation and
  subordination of women. But the one-case stories avoid this recognition by
  treating something ubiquitous as exceptional and isolated. The only thing
  exceptional about Epstein’s crimes was their scale and maybe the complexity of
  the international financial, transportation and other systems he used to
  traffic, control, abuse and silence victims. The nature of the crimes was
  ordinary and common. In the US, there’s a rape every 68 seconds, a woman is
  beaten by an intimate partner every nine seconds, and while more men are
  murdered annually than women, “over half of female homicide victims are killed
  by a current or former male intimate partner”, according to the CDC. Globally
  a woman or girl is murdered by her partner or family member every 10 minutes.
  A high percentage of human trafficking worldwide is of women and girls for
  sexual exploitation. Instead of focusing on high-profile cases in my opening
  paragraphs, I could have found examples from the hundreds of cases of sexual
  abuse of women, girls and boys by ministers of the Southern Baptist church.
  NPR reported in 2022 that, “the Southern Baptist Convention’s Executive
  Committee mishandled allegations of sex abuse, stonewalled numerous survivors
  and prioritized protecting the SBC from liability”. Or the grotesqueries of
  Andrew Cuomo’s alleged sexual harassment and groping while he was governor of
  New York, followed by his persecution of those who spoke up. I could have
  brought up that both US and Canadian residential schools for Indigenous
  children are being exposed as former students who were sexually abused in them
  find the space to speak out. The pretense that we will find out whether or not
  Donald Trump is a sexual predator if the Epstein files are released is itself
  a kind of cover-up, since we already know he is – though I’m all for finding
  out exactly what it is he’s so frantic to hide. He was found liable for
  sexually assaulting E Jean Carroll in a 2023 civil trial and has been credibly
  accused of groping, grabbing, and assault by numerous women. His
  worse-than-creepy behavior around the teenage girls in beauty pageants he
  managed is well-documented, as is his closeness to Epstein. Now, like all the
  men mentioned in the first paragraphs of this essay, Trump has a protection
  machine at work – one without precedent. Our own federal government, funded by
  our taxes, is apparently striving to protect Trump from whatever’s in those
  files. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, has adjourned Congress to
  protect Trump from Democratic measures meant to force Republicans to vote on
  releasing the Epstein files. Many high-level officials are serving not We the
  People, but Trump the Frantic. As the Hill reports, Senator Dick Durbin of the
  judiciary committee “says he has received information that Attorney General
  Pam Bondi ‘pressured’ about 1,000 FBI personnel to comb through tens of
  thousands of pages of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey
  Epstein and flag any mention of President Trump”. A thousand workers pulled
  off their official jobs – this extraordinary effort only makes Trump look like
  he has a lot to hide. But in another sense the whole society is hiding
  something: that this violence is everywhere and it deeply shapes – or
  misshapes – our society. The statistics I cited above address the victims of
  specific crimes. But all girls and women are impacted by the reality that so
  many men want to harm us and these crimes could happen to any one of us. This
  violence affects the choices we make about where to go and when, what jobs to
  take, when to speak up, what to wear. The threat of violence and actual
  violence by some men against some women and girls establishes female
  vulnerability and fear and disempowerment far more broadly. Society has
  largely required us to alter our lives to avoid this, rather than society
  being altered to make us free and equal. This violence is an engine of
  inequality that benefits all men, insofar as being “more equal than others” in
  this respect is a benefit. The piecemeal stories – “here is this one bad man
  we need to do something about” – don’t address the reality that the problem is
  systemic and the solution isn’t police and prison. It’s social change, and
  societies will have changed enough when violence against women ceases to be a
  pandemic that stretches across continents and centuries. Systemic problems
  require systemic responses, and while I’m all for releasing the Epstein files,
  I want a broader conversation and deeper change. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian
  US columnist. She is the author of No Straight Road Takes You There and
  Orwell’s Roses
