  A Georgia man who opened fire on the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta on Friday, shooting dozens of rounds into four
  buildings and killing a police officer, had blamed a Covid-19 vaccine for
  making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told the
  Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old gunman, identified by the
  Georgia bureau of investigation as Patrick Joseph White, tried to get into the
  CDC’s headquarters but was stopped by guards before driving to a CVS across
  the street and opening fire, the official said. White died during Friday’s
  violence. The suspect’s father contacted police and said his son was upset
  about the death of his dog, and had also become fixated on the Covid-19
  vaccine, an official said. One of White’s neighbors told the Atlanta
  Journal-Constitution: “He very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were
  hurting other people.” The police officer who was shot to death in a
  confrontation with a gunman was identified as 33-year-old David Rose – a
  husband and father of two daughters who had a son on the way. Rose, who joined
  the DeKalb county police force in September of last year and previously served
  in the US marines, had responded to reports of gunfire near the CDC campus. He
  was later rushed to the Emory University hospital, where he died of his
  injuries. After firing shots at the CDC campus near Emory University on Friday
  afternoon, White was found dead on the second floor of the pharmacy building.
  Authorities have not said if he was killed by police or took his own life. He
  was reported to be wearing a surgical mask and was armed with two handguns, a
  rifle and a shotgun, and he was carrying two backpacks filled with ammo,
  officials told CNN. The CDC director, Susan Monarez, confirmed that at least
  four buildings at the public health agency had been struck in the shooting,
  which began shortly before 5pm on Friday. “The active shooter incident near
  our campus today has understandably brought fear, anger and worry to all of
  us,” Monarez said in a message to CDC employees. “I want to express my deep
  appreciation for your professionalism and resilience during this time.” “We
  are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC’s Atlanta campus that took
  the life of officer David Rose. We stand with his wife and three children and
  the entire CDC family,” the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, posted
  online on Saturday. But those words of sympathy from Kennedy, an avowed
  skeptic of vaccine safety, were rejected by a group of former CDC scientists,
  communicators, policy analysts and public health experts who were laid off by
  the Trump administration. “Kennedy is directly responsible for the
  villainization of CDC’s workforce through his continuous lies about science
  and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,”
  Fired but Fighting, a group of former CDC employees who were laid off, said in
  a statement. “We don’t need thoughts and prayers. We need an administration
  that does not villainize federal workers who are just trying to do their job.
  We need a HHS Secretary who does not promote misinformation about science and
  vaccines.” Kennedy recently ordered the cutting of the budget for mRNA vaccine
  development. He said in a statement that the Biomedical Advanced Research and
  Development Authority (Barda) would terminate 22 mRNA vaccine development
  investments, suggesting the vaccines “fail to protect effectively against
  upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. Critics said the decision
  was not grounded in science and pointed to evidence that the covid vaccines
  had saved millions of lives. Atlanta-headquartered CNN reported that White’s
  father alerted law enforcement before the shooting that he believed his son
  was suicidal. Cody Alcorn with Atlanta’s 11 Alive reported that one of White’s
  neighbors said he was against vaccines and had looked “noticeably” slimmer
  recently. Another neighbor described White as “pleasant” and said he never
  talked politics “but was against the vaccine”. The outlet also reported that
  crime scene investigators found more than 40 bullet holes in multiple CDC
  buildings after Friday’s attack. Building 21, where the CDC director has her
  office, took much of the gunfire. The Atlanta police chief, Darin Schierbaum,
  said the department had received a call about an active shooter at about
  4.50pm and arrived at the scene to find Rose critically injured. DeKalb
  county’s interim police chief, Greg Padrick, said Rose “was committed to
  serving the community” and requested prayers for “his family, his friends, his
  loved ones and the entire DeKalb county police department family”. The
  director of the FBI, Kash Patel, said Rose was a hero who “made the ultimate
  sacrifice”. “Pray for the family, friends, and colleagues of this hero who
  acted quickly to defend others and made the ultimate sacrifice,” Patel said in
  a post on X. The attack came as threats of violence against healthcare
  professionals in the US are on the rise. A survey by National Nurses United,
  the largest union of registered nurses in the US, found that 48% of the more
  than 2,000 responding nurses reported an increase in workplace violence. In
  December, UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson was shot
  dead on a Manhattan street. Suspect Luigi Mangione, who is awaiting trial in
  the case, left a trail of indicators that he may have been motivated by anger
  toward the health insurance industry. Associated Press contributed reporting
