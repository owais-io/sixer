  As the 2025 British &amp; Irish Lions prepare for their last hurrah there are
  distant echoes of former glories in the damp Sydney air. A highly respected
  English lock forward leading out a history-chasing team in the same stadium
  which staged the 2003 Rugby World Cup final? It is not the worst of precedents
  for Maro Itoje as he and his modern-day Lions await their third and final date
  with destiny. Itoje and his squad would also dearly love to rekindle memories
  of another significant contest in this city. The decisive concluding Test of
  the 2013 Lions series was a classic example of a touring side saving its best
  until last, with a tiring Wallaby side eventually losing 41-16 after a certain
  assistant coach called Andy Farrell had urged the players to take their hosts
  to “the hurt arena”. This time around, among other things, Farrell has been
  invoking the never-say-die ethos of the Irish boxer Katie Taylor, who was
  asked to record a few motivational words for the Lions. “Prepare to win by
  skill but be ready to win by will,” was Taylor’s pithy message and, despite
  the likelihood of wet conditions, Farrell is keen for his team to tick both
  boxes en route to a 3-0 series whitewash. Australia will have other ideas, of
  course, but even their head coach, Joe Schmidt, has acknowledged their
  agonising near miss in Melbourne last Saturday has been tough for his squad to
  absorb. The series is already gone, the influential Rob Valetini is sidelined
  again and they are up against opponents who still have a collective glint in
  their eyes. To make matters worse, the Wallabies have also been enduring
  further disruption on the eve of the game with Brandon Paenga-Amosa called up
  as emergency cover at hooker following injuries to Dave Porecki and Matt
  Faessler. When it rains as pours, as has very much been the case in a soaking
  Sydney over recent days. Whichever combinations are wearing gold, though, it
  will not affect the visitors’ stated objectives. They want to fly home as the
  first Lions squad since 1927 to win every game of a multi-Test series,
  although the legendary 1974 team did famously claim three wins and a draw
  against the Springboks. There is clearly a debate to be had about whether
  beating a moderate Wallaby team compares, say, with outclassing South Africa
  at altitude but, either way, a 3-0 winning margin would stand the test of
  time. Emotionally, certainly, there remains much to play for. On the eve of
  the game, Itoje had his match jersey presented to him by Kate Hardman, who has
  been diagnosed with incurable breast cancer but is travelling around Australia
  in a camper van with her husband and three children, seeking to make family
  memories that will never fade. If that story doesn’t heighten the Lions’
  desire to create a few last golden moments of their own, nothing will. And the
  more you think about it, the more a clean sweep would also mean to several
  squad members who have also had to overcome assorted challenges to reach this
  point. Andrew Porter, for example, was 12 when he lost his mother to cancer
  and subsequently had to battle mental health issues including an eating
  disorder. Four years ago, having achieved his lifelong dream of being picked
  for the Lions, he was injured before departure and was unable to tour South
  Africa. Among the things that have kept him going is a quote written down by
  his mum before her death. “Do work you believe in, believe in what you do.
  Everything else is a waste of time.” For him and his family this tour has been
  the most heartwarming of postscripts. Everything is clearly relative but a
  place in the record books would also be something special for Tadhg Furlong,
  Dan Sheehan, Tom Curry, Huw Jones and Blair Kinghorn, all of whom have spent
  periods of the last year battling injuries which tested their resolve. Ditto
  Hugo Keenan and Tommy Freeman, who was struggling with a back injury on
  Friday, both late developers not obviously heading for Lions greatness in
  their teens. And not forgetting Bundee Aki and Jamison Gibson-Park, for whom
  the notion of wearing a red Lions jersey was never even on their radar.
  Sprinkle all these individual plotlines into the same crusading narrative and
  their shared power has been significant. The Lions could have folded at 23-5
  down in Melbourne but, even in their darkest moments, the squad’s competitive
  spirit has never wavered. This is also not a squad who are mentally already on
  the beach; the hosts may be in for another tough day regardless of the
  weather. Admittedly the Wallabies did raise a smile by turning up for their
  pre-game team photo in fake moustaches in tribute to their retiring scrum-half
  Nic White, but it would be no laughing matter should the Lions get ahead early
  this time and stay there. White’s box kicking, though, may prove useful in the
  conditions while the Exeter-bound Tom Hooper will want to make an impact in
  Valetini’s absence. Hooper hails from Australia’s self-proclaimed toughest
  town (Bathurst, in case you’re ever passing) and, along with the colossal Will
  Skelton, offers a steely physical edge that Australia will definitely require.
  Even that, however, may not be sufficient if the Lions still have some
  collective gas left in the tank. Sheehan, Furlong, Itoje, Curry, Gibson-Park,
  Tadhg Beirne and Finn Russell would all be candidates for inclusion in a
  composite matchday 23 drawn from the last three Lions tours and one more
  command performance could yet elevate a couple more into that category. It is
  also increasingly hard to dispute Farrell’s credentials as an all-time Lion
  king, capable of pressing performance buttons that other coaches struggle to
  reach. Even his captain, who used to attend the same Hertfordshire school as
  Owen Farrell, has been increasingly fascinated by Farrell Sr’s instinct for
  what makes a rugby player tick. “I don’t know if it is a surprise but it has
  reaffirmed that he’s just an impressive character,” stressed Itoje. “He’s a
  brilliant orator, he holds the room and is a great motivator of men. He’s also
  quite thoughtful. Probably what has surprised me is how hot on detail he is.
  He is very particular on detail and how the week flows, which is very good
  from a players’ point of view. I’ve enjoyed the experience.” All that remains
  now is to drag the Wallabies back into the hurt arena one last time.
