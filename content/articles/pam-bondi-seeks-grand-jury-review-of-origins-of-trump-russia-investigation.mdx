  The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, is said to be ordering prosecutors to
  present evidence to a grand jury investigating the origins of the FBI’s
  Trump-Russia inquiry, according to the Associated Press. The criminal probe
  follows referrals from Trump administration intelligence officials and targets
  the investigation that established Moscow interfered in the 2016 election on
  Donald Trump’s behalf, a source who spoke on condition of anonymity told the
  AP. Fox News first reported the development. Details remain unclear about
  which former officials face potential charges, where proceedings will occur,
  and what specific misconduct allegations could support criminal indictments.
  The justice department did not respond to a request for comment. The
  development is likely to heighten concerns that the justice department is
  being used to achieve political ends given longstanding grievances over the
  Russia investigation voiced by Trump, who has called for the jailing of
  perceived political adversaries, and because any criminal investigation would
  revisit one of the most dissected chapters of modern American political
  history. It is also surfacing at a time when the Trump administration is being
  buffeted by criticism over its handling of documents from the Jeffrey Epstein
  sex-trafficking investigation. The initial, years-old investigation into
  Russian election interference resulted in the appointment of a special
  counsel, Robert Mueller, who secured multiple convictions against Trump aides
  and allies but did not establish proof of a criminal conspiracy between Moscow
  and the Republican’s campaign. Mueller’s investigation documented extensive
  Russian interference in the 2016 election and identified multiple instances
  where Trump may have obstructed justice, with the special counsel explicitly
  stating his report did not exonerate the president. The inquiry shadowed much
  of Trump’s first presidency, and he has long focused his ire on senior
  officials from the intelligence and law enforcement community, including
  former FBI director James Comey, whom he fired in May 2017, and ex-CIA
  director John Brennan. The justice department appeared to confirm an
  investigation into both men in an unusual statement in July but offered no
  details. Multiple special counsels, congressional committees and the justice
  department’s own inspector general have studied and documented a multipronged
  effort by Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election on Trump’s
  behalf, including through a hack-and-leak dump of Democratic emails and a
  covert social media operation aimed at sowing discord and swaying public
  opinion. The Republican-led Senate intelligence committee released a
  comprehensive bipartisan report in 2020 that confirmed extensive Russian
  interference and documented concerning contacts between Trump campaign
  associates and Russians. It found that campaign chair Paul Manafort shared
  internal polling data with a Russian intelligence officer and that the
  campaign welcomed Russian assistance. But that conclusion has been
  aggressively challenged in recent weeks as Trump’s director of national
  intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and other allies have released previously
  classified records that they hope will cast doubt on the extent of Russian
  interference and establish an Obama administration effort to falsely link
  Trump to Russia. In one batch of documents released in July, Gabbard disclosed
  emails showing that senior Barack Obama administration officials were aware in
  2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate the
  votes in Trump’s favor. But Obama’s administration never alleged that votes
  were tampered with and had instead detailed other forms of election
  interference and foreign influence. A new outcry surfaced last week when
  Republican Senate judiciary committee chairperson Chuck Grassley released a
  set of emails that FBI director Kash Patel claimed on social media proved that
  Hillary Clinton’s 2016 White House campaign “plotted to frame president Trump
  and fabricate the Russia collusion hoax”. The emails were part of a classified
  annex of a report issued in 2023 by John Durham, the special counsel who was
  appointed during the first Trump administration to hunt for government
  misconduct during the Russia investigation. Durham did identify significant
  flaws in the investigation but uncovered no bombshells to disprove the
  existence of Russian election interference. His probe produced three criminal
  cases – two resulted in acquittals by a jury and the third was a guilty plea
  from a little-known FBI lawyer to a charge of making a false statement.
  Multiple investigations during the Trump administration, including by his own
  justice department inspector general, concluded that while the FBI made
  procedural errors in its Russia investigation, the initial decision to open
  the inquiry was properly justified. Republicans seized on a 27 July 2016 email
  in Durham’s newly declassified annex that claimed Clinton had approved a plan
  during the heat of the campaign to link Trump with Russia. But the purported
  author of the email, a senior official at a philanthropic organization founded
  by billionaire investor George Soros, told Durham’s team he had never sent the
  email and the alleged recipient said she never recalled receiving it. Durham’s
  own report noted investigators could not verify the communications as
  authentic, assessing the message was likely “a composite of several emails”
  obtained through Russian hacking , suggesting it may have been Russian
  disinformation. The Associated Press contributed reporting
