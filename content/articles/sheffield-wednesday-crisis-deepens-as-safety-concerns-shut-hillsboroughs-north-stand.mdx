  Sheffield Wednesday crisis deepens as safety concerns shut Hillsborough’s
  North Stand

  Sheffield Wednesday have been banned from opening Hillsborough’s North Stand
  to spectators due to safety concerns, further compounding the challenges
  facing the crisis-hit club before the new Championship season. With Wednesday
  under an EFL transfer embargo, and Danny Rohl departing as manager this week,
  a prohibition notice issued by Sheffield city council means another problem
  has hit the club’s ownership, led by the Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri.
  Wednesday’s first home game of the season is on Saturday 16 August, against
  Stoke. Sheffield councillor Joe Otten said the decision had been taken
  following an assessment “by engineering specialists who can no longer confirm
  that the North Stand is safe for spectator use”. Previous meetings of the
  local Safety Advisory Group, first reported by the BBC, had observed there was
  corrosion in trusses supporting the roof of the stand, as well as insecure
  electrical wiring and cracks in the terracing itself. The North Stand was
  built in the 1960-61 season and has a capacity of 9,255 spectators, many of
  whom are season-tickets holders. The stand also provides access for supporters
  with disabilities, with 54 wheelchair spaces and accessible seating for up to
  360 people. Fans are now left waiting to know whether they will be able to
  watch their team during the upcoming campaign, which begins in a little over a
  week. Wednesday are under a transfer embargo and subject to EFL fee
  restrictions until the end of the summer window following a previous failure
  to pay transfer fees on time. Further sanctions could be forthcoming if the
  club fail to make payroll at the end of this month for what would be the
  fourth time in five months. Reports in the Sheffield Star have suggested the
  bill for repairs in the North Stand could reach seven figures. In a statement
  published on their website, the club said: “Sheffield Wednesday can confirm
  that, following a recent meeting with the local Safety Advisory Group,
  Sheffield City Council has today issued a Prohibition Notice preventing the
  use of the North Stand at Hillsborough. “The club are continuing to work with
  the Safety Advisory Group to satisfy their concerns such that the North Stand
  remains open. Additional information is currently being obtained, and we will
  provide further updates to our supporters at the earliest possible
  opportunity.”
