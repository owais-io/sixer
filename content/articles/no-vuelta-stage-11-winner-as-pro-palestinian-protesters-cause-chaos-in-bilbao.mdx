  Sport without a definitive result is very strange but these times are far from
  normal. After the start of the Vuelta a España’s 11th stage was the latest
  major cycling race to be disrupted by pro-Palestinian human rights protesters,
  race organisers took the decision to neutralise the finish as it became clear
  the finish line in Bilbao could be targeted. It was a call made to protect the
  safety of the cyclists but it also potentially denied a visibly frustrated Tom
  Pidcock a first stage win at the Spanish Grand Tour. The Briton attacked on
  the final climb and achieved the rare feat of troubling Jonas Vingegaard, the
  man in the leader’s red jersey, but the battle was not allowed to reach a
  proper conclusion. The Dane did get back in touch with Pidcock on Alto de Pike
  and the pair were pulling away from the other general classification
  favourites on the run into Bilbao when the stage was waved off. The riders
  were informed just after passing the point with 20km to go about the decision
  to halt the stage 3km out from the original finish line, but Pidcock was not
  aware of where that point was on the course and was still in race mode when
  the marshals flagged the leaders off. The Q36.5 Pro Cycling rider gave a
  measured interview after the race, stressing that he “didn’t want to say
  anything political” but, having had to duck under a protester’s banner on the
  penultimate climb, he was keen to make the point about rider safety. “It’s
  hard to describe the disappointment,” Pidcock said. “I felt like today was my
  day. I feel like there should always be a finish line, we’re not riding a
  fucking sportive, are we? It’s not easy, the Vuelta did what they could to
  keep us safe. “A lot of people have held back from talking about it publicly
  but it is a bit scary sometimes in the peloton. I think as long as our safety
  is first then we can continue racing and that’s what we’re here to do. I think
  bike racing has got nothing to do with what is happening in other … yeah.”
  Asked if he had a message for the protestors, he said: “I think putting us in
  danger isn’t going to help your cause, that simply isn’t going to help what
  they’re protesting for. Everyone has the right to protest whatever they want –
  putting us in danger is not the way forward.” The main target of protest is
  the Israel-Premier Tech team, who were stopped last week during the time trial
  by activists holding Palestinian flags. A stage held in the fiercely
  independent Basque region of Spain was always going to be a potential
  flashpoint, with the local political party EH Bildu calling for Israel‑Premier
  Tech’s withdrawal from the Vuelta in the buildup. In a statement on Wednesday
  night the team said: “Israel – Premier Tech is a professional cycling team. As
  such, the team remains committed to racing on at the Vuelta a España. Any
  other course of action sets a dangerous precedent in the sport of cycling not
  only for Israel–Premier Tech, but for all teams.” “Israel-Premier Tech has
  repeatedly expressed its respect for everyones’ right to protest, as long as
  those protests remain peaceful and do not compromise the safety of the
  peloton. The Vuelta a España race organization and police are doing everything
  in their power to create a safe environment and, for that, the team is
  especially grateful. “However, the behaviour of protestors in Bilbao today was
  not only dangerous, but counterproductive to their cause and deprived the
  Basque cycling fans, some of the best cycling fans in the world, of the stage
  finish they deserved.” There have been reports that riders want Israel-Premier
  Tech to withdraw amid concerns over their safety, but no one has gone on the
  record with that demand. The Professional Cyclists’ Association released a
  statement after the disruption at the start of the stage, saying: “Everyone
  has the right to protest but this cannot be done at the expense of athletes
  who are doing their job.” Calling on the Spanish security services to do
  “everything in their power” to ensure rider safety, the CPA statement also
  said: “It is unacceptable that associations, whatever their nature or
  motivations, should allow themselves to compromise the safety and physical
  integrity of athletes on the road. “Cycling is a demanding sport that requires
  total dedication and superhuman effort from riders. They face extreme physical
  challenges on a daily basis, and it is unacceptable that external threats
  should add to these difficulties. The CPA will never tolerate irresponsible
  and dangerous actions by a minority that endanger the lives of our members.”
  GC times were taken at 3km from the finish and Pidcock did take two seconds
  off Vingegaard by coming over the top of Alto de Pike first. The British rider
  moved into the podium places as Norway’s Torstein Træen (Bahrain-Victorious),
  who started the day second, had been dropped earlier in the stage. Amid a week
  of brutal climbing for the peloton, the famous L’Angliru climb awaits the
  riders on stage 13 but before then Thursday features two categorised climbs,
  including the Collada de Brenes, a 7.7km drag at an average gradient of nearly
  8%.
