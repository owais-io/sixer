  ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

  An outbreak of a respiratory disease, possibly Covid-19, is running rampant
  through the remote Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz”,
  according to the attorney of an infected detainee removed from the camp last
  week. Eric Lee said he was told by his client Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez that
  conditions at the facility had deteriorated significantly since Thursday as
  more migrants held there by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)
  agency experienced symptoms. Lee said authorities removed Rivas Velásquez, a
  38-year-old Venezuelan man, from the camp after he was diagnosed in a hospital
  visit last week, then secretly taken to a similar facility in Texas.
  Protesters at the gates of the jail in the heart of the Florida Everglades
  have recorded a number of instances of ambulances arriving and leaving. Lee
  said the hastily erected tented camp, which Democratic lawmakers have decried
  for holding thousands of undocumented detainees in cages as they await
  deportation, is a “petri dish for disease”. He added: “Based on what multiple
  detainees have told me, in the last 72 to 100 hours, there is some respiratory
  disease which has made the majority, or I would even say vast majority of
  detainees, sick in some form. “There are people who are losing breath. There
  are people who are walking around coughing on one another. Their requests for
  masks from the guards are denied, and they only are allowed to shower once or
  maybe twice a week. “I said to Luis, ‘pass the phone. Let me hear it from
  somebody else. I just want to make sure that people’s stories are straight.’
  And unfortunately they very much are.” The development follows a claim by a
  woman, a state licensed corrections officer, who said she contracted Covid-19
  after working at the camp in unsanitary conditions for about a week last
  month, and was subsequently fired. “We had to use the porta-johns. We didn’t
  have hot water half the time. Our bathrooms were backed up,” the woman told
  NBC6 News after being granted anonymity to discuss conditions there. “[The
  detainees] have no sunlight. There’s no clock in there. They don’t even know
  what time of the day it is. The bathrooms are backed up because so many people
  [are] using them.” The Florida department of emergency management, which is
  responsible for operations at the jail, did not immediately respond to a
  request from the Guardian for comment. In a statement to the Miami New Times,
  Stephanie Hartman, a department spokesperson, did not answer questions about a
  possible outbreak, but insisted: “Detainees have access to a 24/7, fully
  staffed medical facility with a pharmacy on site.” Lee said Rivas Velásquez
  told him in a phone call that he pleaded for medical attention for 48 hours
  after contracting breathing difficulties, and eventually collapsed inside the
  metal cage in which he and dozens of other inmates were being held. He said
  his client was taken to Miami’s Kendall regional medical center, where he was
  diagnosed with a respiratory infection, then returned only briefly to the
  Everglades camp before disappearing for three days. Lee said Rivas Velásquez
  called on Sunday from a new detention camp in El Paso, Texas. “He said when he
  was returned to the Alcatraz facility he asked the guards to provide his
  medical records and they said they would not do that,” Lee said. “The guards
  came to his bed, opened his pillow, took all the poetry and letters he’d been
  writing, and all the notes he’d been taking about his experiences, and told
  him he’s no longer allowed to write.” Apart from the brief call from Texas,
  Lee said he had no further information about his client’s wellbeing. “I
  haven’t heard from him for two days now. I have no idea how he’s doing or
  frankly whether he’s alive or not. It’s hard to wage a legal fight when you
  don’t even have access to your client,” he said. If the outbreak is Covid, Lee
  added, it would have consequences beyond Alligator Alcatraz. “The disease
  doesn’t recognize the prison walls and guards are going to get sick. They’ll
  give it to their kids, it’s going to get into the Miami school system, people
  are going to get sick and die as a result of the conditions that are in this
  facility,” he said.
