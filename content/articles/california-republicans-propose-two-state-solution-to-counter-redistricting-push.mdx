  Republicans in California are proposing a “two-state solution” for the Golden
  state, in a move that is unlikely to go anywhere, but is reflective of
  partisan divisions amid a nationwide battle over control of Congress. James
  Gallagher, the top Republican in the California assembly, on Wednesday
  unveiled a resolution that proposes to split the state vertically, carving the
  deep-blue coastal strip away from the more rural, red inland. The
  provocatively named plan – borrowing a phrase more often used in reference to
  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – is a political nonstarter. But it
  underscores the new messaging Republicans plan to use as they rally opposition
  to a redistricting ballot initiative in November. Framing it as a response to
  Democrats’ effort to temporarily override the state constitution and redraw
  congressional districts – itself a countermove to Republican-led redistricting
  plan sought by Donald Trump in Texas – Gallagher argued that the new maps in
  California would further “silence rural voices and rig the political system
  against them forever”. “I have come to see that the only way we can obtain
  proper attention is by pursuing our own statehood,” he said in a statement on
  Wednesday. “With this measure, we will begin the first step of that process.”
  According to Gallagher, it would create a new state with a population of more
  than 10 million people – making it one of the 10 most populous states in the
  US. “Whether you are from the north state, Central valley, or the Inland
  Empire, life has become harder and completely unaffordable,” the Republican
  leader explained. “We have been overlooked for far too long and now they are
  trying to rip away what little representation we have left.” Democrats quickly
  dismissed the proposal. “A person who seeks to split California does not
  deserve to hold office in the Golden State,” a spokesperson for the California
  governor, Gavin Newsom, said in a statement. “This is a stunt that will go
  nowhere.” Nick Miller, a spokesperson for the speaker of the California state
  assembly, Robert Rivas, argued that Gallagher’s resolution was a gerrymander
  of its own. “Assembly Republicans say they oppose gerrymandering but just drew
  this joke of a map,” he said, adding: “a true James Gallamander”. California’s
  Democratic-controlled legislature last week approved a sweeping redistricting
  plan, dubbed the “gavinmander” by state Republicans, aimed at redrawing the
  state’s congressional boundaries to create five new Democratic US House seats
  – the same number of Trump has claimed Republicans are “entitled to” in Texas.
  The redistricting tit-for-tat is an extraordinary development before next
  year’s midterm elections. Traditionally, states redraw congressional maps once
  a decade based on census data, with both the Texas and California maps
  originally intended to last through 2030. California voters will have to
  decide in a special election in November whether they will let lawmakers
  redraw the map. With a little over two months to go, it is unclear whether the
  majority of voters will give their approval. A recent UC Berkeley Institute of
  Governmental Studies poll, conducted for the Los Angeles Times, found 46% of
  respondents agreed the redistricting plans were a good idea, while 36% said it
  was a bad idea, and 48% said they would vote in favor of the plan if it
  appeared on the ballot.
