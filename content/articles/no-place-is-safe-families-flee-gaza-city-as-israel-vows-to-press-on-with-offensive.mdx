  Israeli aircraft and tanks have pounded the eastern and northern outskirts of
  Gaza City, destroying buildings and homes, as Israeli leaders vowed to press
  on with an expanded large-scale offensive on the city. Witnesses reported the
  sound of continuous explosions overnight from Saturday night into Sunday
  morning in the areas of Zeitoun and Shejaia. Meanwhile, tanks shelled houses
  and roads in the nearby Sabra neighbourhood and several buildings were blown
  up in the northern area of Jabaliya. Fire lit the skies from the direction of
  the explosions, causing panic and prompting some families to stream out of the
  city. Other residents said they would prefer to die and not leave. About half
  of Gaza’s roughly 2 million people currently live in Gaza City. A few thousand
  have already left, carrying their belongings on vehicles and rickshaws. “I
  stopped counting the times I had to take my wife and three daughters and leave
  my home in Gaza City,” Mohammad, 40, told Reuters. “No place is safe, but I
  can’t take the risk. If they suddenly begin the invasion, they will use heavy
  fire.” Others said they would not leave, despite the explosions. “We are not
  leaving, let them bomb us at home,” said Aya, 31, who had a family of eight,
  adding that they could not afford to buy a tent or pay for the transportation,
  even if they did try to leave. “We are hungry, afraid and don’t have money.”
  Israel approved a plan earlier this month for an expanded military offensive
  to seize control of Gaza City. It is not expected to move forces into the
  largely destroyed city centre for a few weeks, leaving room for mediators
  Egypt and Qatar to try to resume ceasefire talks. Still, Israeli forces have
  bombed the city and surrounding areas, and said on Sunday that forces had
  returned to combat in the Jabaliya area in recent days. Israel’s defence
  minister, Israel Katz, on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive, which
  has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. On Friday, Katz said that Gaza
  City would be razed unless Hamas militants agreed to end the war on Israel’s
  terms and release all the hostages it still holds. Hamas said in a statement
  on Sunday that Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it was not serious
  about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire agreement was “the only way to return
  the hostages”, holding the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
  responsible for their lives. UN-backed experts declared on Friday that an
  “entirely man-made” famine is taking place in Gaza’s largest city and its
  surrounding area amid deteriorating conditions that threaten increasing deaths
  across the devastated territory. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be
  halted and reversed,” the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase
  Classification (IPC) said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed,
  starvation is present and is rapidly spreading … If a ceasefire is not
  implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and
  if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and
  water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase
  exponentially.” On Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people had
  died of malnutrition and starvation, raising deaths from such causes to 289
  people, including 115 children, since the war started. Gaza’s civil defence
  agency reported at least 42 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on
  Sunday. Spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said there had been several airstrikes
  around Gaza City, including one in Sabra that killed eight people. Attacks
  were also reported elsewhere across the territory, he said, with the “total
  tally currently rising to 42 dead”. Israel is fighting allegations at the
  world’s top court of committing genocide in Gaza, where it has killed more
  than 60,000 people. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has
  issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav
  Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief
  Mohammed Deif, but later withdrew it after he was killed. The Associated Press
  reported that Israeli forces had killed four people seeking food aid on Sunday
  as they travelled through a military zone south of Gaza City – an area
  regularly used by Palestinians trying to reach a food distribution point.
  Al-Awda hospital and two witnesses told the Associated Press that the four
  Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site
  run by the Israeli-backed US contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in
  the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of metres away from the site,
  the witnesses said. “The gunfire was indiscriminate,” Mohamed Abed, a father
  of two from the Bureij refugee camp, told Associated Press, adding that while
  many had fled, some people fell to the ground after being shot. Abed and Aymed
  Sayyad, another Palestinian seeking food among the crowd, said troops opened
  fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a
  distribution site before its scheduled opening. The Israeli military and GHF
  did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters and the
  Associated Press contributed to this report
