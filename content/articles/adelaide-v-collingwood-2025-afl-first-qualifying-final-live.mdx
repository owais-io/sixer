  Here are the two lineups. ADELAIDE B: Josh Worrell, Mark Keane, Rory Laird HB:
  Wayne Milera, Nick Murray, Max Michalanney C: Isaac Cumming, Jordan Dawson,
  Daniel Curtin HF: Ben Keays, Riley Thilthorpe, Alex Neal-Bullen F: Zac Taylor,
  Taylor Walker, Darcy Fogarty FOLL: Reilly O’Brien, Sam Berry, Jake Soligo I/C:
  Luke Pedlar, James Peatling, Mitchell Hinge, Hugh Bond; Sub: Brodie Smith
  COLLINGWOOD B: Billy Frampton, Darcy Moore, Brayden Maynard HB: Harry
  Perryman, Josh Daicos, Wil Parker C: Jack Crisp, Ned Long, Steele Sidebottom
  HF: Jordan De Goey, Tim Membrey, Beau McCreery F: Jamie Elliott, Brody
  Mihocek, Lachie Schultz FOLL: Darcy Cameron, Scott Pendlebury, Nick Daicos
  I/C: Patrick Lipinski, Isaac Quaynor, Dan Houston, Mason Cox; Sub: Roan Steele
  Final teams are in with no late changes as Beau McCreery is cleared to play
  for Collingwood. The speedy forward made the most of the pre-finals bye to
  recover from a foot issue that he picked up when it was stepped on during the
  final round. Adelaide name veteran Brodie Smith as sub in their first final
  since 2017. Mid-season draftee Roan Steele is Collingwood’s 23rd player. The
  Crows are boosted by the return of young defender Max Michalanney as he
  recovers from a hamstring strain, while Luke Pedlar had the same issue but
  will slot straight back into the forward line. Sid Draper and Billy Dowling
  are dropped from the side that edged North Melbourne in round 24, though the
  most notable absence is of course the suspended forward Izak Rankine. The
  Magpies are backing youngster Wil Parker to play just his ninth game in place
  of the injured Jeremy Howe. Mason Cox has been recalled for his ninth game
  this season at the expense of the out-of-sorts Dan McStay, as the Pies shake
  up their options in an attack that could only find eight goals from 71 inside
  50s when these sides met a few weeks ago. Hello and welcome to live coverage
  of the qualifying final between Adelaide and Collingwood at Adelaide Oval. It
  is fewer than three weeks since these same sides played out a thriller that
  the Crows won by three points to lock in a top-two finish as they return to
  finals for the first time in eight years. The Magpies were the early
  pacesetters this season as they opened up a 14-2 record and sat on top of the
  ladder for 13 weeks before the Crows surged past them on the run home to claim
  the minor premiership. The Crows’ round 23 victory was their first over the
  Pies since 2017 and snapped an 11-game winless streak, though that horror run
  hides the recent history between these evenly-matched sides. While the Pies
  built up a dominant record over the Crows across seven seasons, the last six
  matches have been decided by a combined 25 points. During finals sign up for
  our free weekly AFL newsletter The Crows head into the final in red-hot form
  after winning their past nine matches, while the Magpies will have appreciated
  the week off with the pre-finals bye after losing five of their past seven.
  The Pies can at least turn to wealth of experience, especially in finals,
  while only seven of the Crows’ named 23 have been to this stage before. The
  winner tonight will head straight to a preliminary final along with hosting
  rights, while the loser will need to bounce back in a semi-final against GWS
  Giants or Hawthorn. First bounce will be at 7.10pm local time in Adelaide /
  7.40pm AEST. I’ll drop in the team news shortly. Meanwhile, let us know your
  thoughts and predictions – shoot me an email or find me @martinpegan on
  Bluesky or X. Let’s get into it!
