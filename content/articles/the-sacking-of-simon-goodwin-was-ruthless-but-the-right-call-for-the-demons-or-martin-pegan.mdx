  Simon Goodwin will forever remain in Melbourne folklore as the coach that
  broke the curse – the coach that finally followed in the footsteps of club
  great Norm Smith when he helped end almost six decades of misery with a
  fairytale premiership. For now, Goodwin is one of only four coaches to lead
  the Demons to a VFL/AFL flag. But the one-time powerhouse club is right to
  look forward rather than backward, in the hope of finding the next coach to
  take it to the promised land. Melbourne’s decision to sack a
  premiership-winner is among the most ruthless the AFL has seen in recent
  years. It has become all too common for head coaches to be given extra time,
  whether to build a team from the ground up or to turn around an unexpected
  decline. But in a cut-throat business where there is only one real winner, as
  well as several other clubs that might take comfort from at least heading in
  the right direction, Goodwin sails off into the sunset with the Demons’
  trajectory going the wrong way. The 2021 flag was secured thanks to just over
  a half of football as devastating as has been played on the big stage. With a
  dynamic and game-busting midfield, led by inspirational captain Max Gawn,
  there was more than enough to suggest that the drought-breaking premiership
  was merely the first of many to come for a looming dynasty. Less than four
  years later and the Goodwin era has unravelled amid diminishing returns. It
  comes to a close without even another finals victory, let alone a second taste
  of the ultimate success. The Demons’ 13th premiership was followed by a pair
  of straight-sets finals exits as familiar problems resurfaced. An imbalanced
  list stacked with midfield talent and an imperious defence had fewer weapons
  in the forward half. The team took too long to evolve from a safe but stodgy
  game plan that failed to create enough scoring opportunities. To make matters
  worse, the side paid the price as much as any for wayward kicking for goal
  when the stakes rose. Goodwin was rightfully given a free pass as his side
  plummeted to 14th last year. The dramatic drop off was in part explained by
  on-field and off-field concerns around star midfielders Christian Petracca and
  Clayton Oliver, as well as the premature retirement of Angus Brayshaw. But the
  coach was back on shaky ground when there were few signs of improvement during
  five consecutive defeats to start this year. As the Demons’ mid-season revival
  faded away and they fell out of finals contention, it became a matter of
  “when” rather than “if” the axe would fall. The 48-year-old said all the right
  words as he took his turn to be part of the awkward AFL tradition of sending a
  coach packing with a pat on the back and a stage-managed press conference.
  Just two weeks ago, Goodwin was adamant that he felt “incredibly supported by
  the board” even after a humiliating final-term capitulation against St Kilda.
  As he fronted the media while seated next to Melbourne president and former
  player Brad Green on Tuesday, Goodwin allowed himself a smile as he conceded
  he “obviously got that wrong”. The record-breaking defeat to the Saints – when
  even one of the greatest Demons lost his head in the centre square and Goodwin
  had little to offer beyond standing on the sidelines and looking perplexed –
  was followed by an emphatic triumph over West Coast last week. A win over the
  bottom-placed side is hardly one to save a coaching career but it does make
  the timing of the call to sack Goodwin with a year left on his contract all
  the more curious. With three rounds remaining, Goodwin has declined the offer
  to coach out the season. He has baulked at the opportunity to enjoy the sort
  of send-off that a premiership coach typically deserves. The farewell tour
  would even have begun with a reminder of the glory days when Melbourne face
  their 2021 grand final opponents Western Bulldogs on Sunday. Instead, the
  Demons will tiptoe into their next era with clear air and a head start on
  finding Goodwin’s successor. Goodwin spent 11 years at the Demons including
  nine seasons as head coach. He was handed a team blessed with top-end talent
  and ready to rise, as part of a succession plan to take over from coach Paul
  Roos ahead of the 2017 season. An 11-year finals drought was broken the
  following year as Melbourne reached a preliminary final ahead of time. The
  best was still to come as Goodwin led the Demons to heights they had not
  scaled for 57 years and will live long in their hearts. But the grand old club
  only has to look to the period before Goodwin took charge, rather than all the
  way back to the curse of Norm Smith, to recall how a steady decline can
  quickly turn into something much longer and deeper.
