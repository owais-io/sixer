  If there were any concerns about Ryan Mason’s ability to mix it in the cut and
  thrust of the Championship in his maiden managerial role, then this battling
  West Brom victory, which punctured the mood at early pacesetters Stoke, ought
  to silence them. Mason had seen two vital members of his side depart in the
  days before the trip to the Potteries and had to watch from the stands as he
  served a touchline suspension. That did not prevent his team torpedoing
  Stoke’s 100% start to the campaign with a win which was as hard-fought as it
  was deserved, as Nat Phillips’ 14th-minute goal from a set piece proved the
  difference. West Brom are no longer in receipt of parachute payments so the
  exits of Tom Fellows and Darnell Furlong to recently relegated duo Southampton
  and Ipswich respectively are understandable. Yet there was no sense that any
  belief had drifted away with the two departees, as Mason stressed afterwards.
  “The personality and quality everyone showed was super-pleasing for me,” he
  said. “We’ve lost a few players this week. We lost Darnell who was wearing the
  captain’s armband. And with Tom, anyone that comes through the academy and
  makes a mark on the first team is pretty special. So we showed an incredible
  amount of personality on the back of losing two key players. “Maybe there are
  a few gaps in the squad that we can address in the next 48 hours. But I
  thought the performance was amazing. The work rate of the team, to nullify
  them to just a couple of chances, was excellent today. You need to suffer away
  from home and we’ve done that.” Mason was keen to indicate his team had varied
  their passing style, finding joy throughout via crosses, with Mikey Johnston
  especially troubling the hosts’ defence with deep diagonals from the left.
  After another fizzing cross from the former Celtic winger was squirrelled away
  for a corner, Johansson flapped at Alex Mowatt’s set piece and Phillips
  steered in the loose ball. In Johnston, it seemed Mason’s men had the game’s
  kingpin, his scurrying runs inside from the left regularly forcing Junior
  Tchamadeu to backpedal, and he almost teed up Aune Heggebø on the half hour
  mark as West Brom asserted their dominance. Stoke’s main threat came on the
  counter, their best first-half chance falling to Million Manhoef whose
  near-post header was parried by Josh Griffiths after Sorba Thomas’s whipped
  delivery. West Brom’s superiority from set pieces remained a concern for Stoke
  in the second half. Jed Wallace ought to have made it 2-0 on 69 minutes after
  another flick-on from a Mowatt corner but kicked thin air. The introduction of
  Toby Collyer, the Manchester United loanee, gave West Brom extra legs and
  presence in midfield and they were content to rely on counterattacks as the
  game wore on, while thwarting the hosts’ attempts to equalise. While the
  visitors rarely threatened a second goal, they held out to preserve their
  unbeaten start under the former Tottenham assistant. Mark Robins, the Stoke
  manager who had implored his charges to “park” the alarming 3-0 Carabao Cup
  defeat to Bradford in midweek, said: “West Brom worked their socks off, so
  they deserve a lot of credit. You can’t take too many touches, you’ve got to
  remain disciplined. And during today’s game our players begin to tire. “But
  we’re so much more competitive now and we’ve made strides. We can all dream
  about things like promotion but we haven’t got time, we’ve got to improve.”
