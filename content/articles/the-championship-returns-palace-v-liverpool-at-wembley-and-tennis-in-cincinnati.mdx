  Saturday 8am (all times BST) Matchday live Football Our essential Saturday
  morning gateway to the weekend’s football returns and Yara El-Shaboury is your
  host as the Championship launches with a flurry of matches. Readers are
  invited to get in touch with their plans for the day; we spin through the
  headlines from overnight, including Friday night’s Birmingham v Ipswich
  curtain-raiser; and we flag the day’s big Championship, Football League and
  Scottish Premiership matches, with team news and all the latest breaking
  transfer stories. Post your thoughts and questions to Ben Fisher for our
  Football League Q&amp;A at 11am. Send your queries to
  matchday.live@theguardian.com from 9.30am. Ben sets the scene on the new
  Championship season – the contenders, hopefuls and youngsters to watch – here.
  12.30pm Southampton v Wrexham Championship Wrexham return to the second tier
  for the first time in 43 years. Three consecutive promotions have taken the
  Red Dragons – the Welsh club with Hollywood backing and an unlikely global
  following – from the National League to an opening-day fixture at Southampton,
  freshly relegated from the Premier League. While some fans have been dreaming
  that Wrexham can make it four promotions in succession there is the danger
  that, after such a rapid rise, they find their ceiling – the jump from League
  One to the Championship is bigger than those they have bridged in the past
  couple of years. Ben Fisher reports from St Mary’s. 12.45pm Manchester United
  v Fiorentina Football The noise around United never ceases and Ruben Amorin’s
  outlay on players to refresh a team that struggled so glaringly in the Premier
  League last season has kept them at the forefront of the transfer agenda over
  the summer. So for United’s final warm-up match, plenty of attention will be
  on his new signings, the boyhood supporter Bryan Mbeumo among them. Mbeumo was
  handed the chance to fulfil a dream with a £70m switch from Brentford. Amorim
  will hope the 25-year-old Cameroon forward adds pace, creativity and goals –
  he scored 20 in the league last season – as he attempts to improve upon last
  campaign’s desperately disappointing 15th-place finish. Will Unwin reports.
  3pm Middlesbrough v Swansea Championship Next up in our coverage of the
  opening Championship weekend are another Welsh club with North American
  connections. Comparisons with Wrexham, who are owned by the Hollywood actors
  Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, have been unavoidable since the 53-year-old
  American rapper Snoop Dogg joined a growing list of celebrity investors in
  British football last month by becoming part of a Swansea ownership group that
  already included the Croatia midfield great Luka Modric. Snoop said Swansea’s
  “underdog” story “really struck a chord with me” and his vast following on
  social media – 89 million on Instagram and 20.5 million on X – quickly learned
  about the Welsh club and his love for Joe’s ice-cream in the city. A
  docu-series tracking life at Swansea, on similar lines to the Welcome to
  Wrexham, is understood to be already in the pipeline. Louise Taylor reports.
  8.10pm France v England Women’s rugby union England’s final warm-up match
  before the Women’s Rugby World Cup takes John Mitchell’s side to the Stade Guy
  Boniface to take on old foes France, but again without the experienced Emily
  Scarratt, Claudia Moloney-MacDonald and Holly Aitchison. Also absent will be
  Marlie Packer following last weekend’s red card against Spain. Packer sparked
  fears about her availability for the first fixture of England’s home World Cup
  against the USA on 22 August after she was sent off in a 97-7 win for a clumsy
  clearout. A two-week suspension would have ruled the former Red Roses captain
  out of the opener at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light, but she will miss only
  this fixture after World Rugby handed out a one-match ban. Raphaël Jucobin
  reports from Mont-de-Marsan. tbc Cincinnati Open Tennis Tumaini Carayol
  reports on Emma Raducanu’s preparations for the US Open, the tournament she
  won in 2021, at the Cincinnati Open, where she received a bye in the first
  round and will face Olga Danilovic. The Briton’s form of late has been
  encouraging. She followed a round-three exit to Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon
  with a semi-final showing at the Citi Open in Washington, where she was
  eventually beaten by Anna Kalinskaya. The US Open begins later in August and
  Raducanu is improving under the guidance of Rafael Nadal’s former coach
  Francis Roig. “I’m working on the quality of my shots to be better,” she says.
  “I think against the very top that’s what it needs, it needs to improve.”
  Sunday 8am Matchday live Football Dominic Booth and Daniel Harris pick up the
  baton on our compelling, one-stop guide to the day’s unfurling football
  action. They’ll be spinning through the overnight headlines and keeping track
  of all the breaking news, as well as flagging up the Community Shield at
  Wembley. John Brewin posts updates as he arrives at Wembley for Crystal Palace
  v Liverpool. Expect a rundown of the latest transfer window stories and some
  discussion on fans’ transfer hopes. Team news too for the big game in
  Scotland, Aberdeen v Celtic. 3pm Crystal Palace v Liverpool live Community
  Shield Arne Slot is relishing the challenge of facing Crystal Palace, the FA
  Cup winners, at Wembley, as the Premier League champions aim to begin the new
  season with silverware and prepare for their title defence. Liverpool are
  chasing a 17th Community Shield title, with their latest coming in 2022, but
  their last trip to Wembley ended in a surprise 2-1 League Cup final defeat by
  Newcastle in March. “It’s nice if you can start the season by winning
  something. We have a chance at the beginning of the season. We face a
  difficult Crystal Palace side. They have shown how hard it is to win a one-off
  game with them,” Slot says. “Palace hit the ground running again, it is still
  the same team. A good challenge for us to start the season.” Rob Smyth is your
  minute-by-minute host, while Ed Aarons and John Brewin report from Wembley.
  4.30pm Leicester v Sheffield Wednesday live Championship In a turbulent past
  few months Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with several EFL-imposed
  embargoes for financial breaches, including failing to pay players and staff
  on time in May, June and July. That led to the 15 first-team players still on
  the books at the club to boycott a behind-closed-doors friendly against
  Burnley, which came to light on the same day Henrik Pedersen was announced as
  manager. The Dane is certain there will be no repeat in their Championship
  opener at Leicester. “I think I have a really good relationship with the
  players. I’m convinced we have a group who are really looking forward to
  Sunday’s game and will do everything they can for our club,” he says. Daniel
  Harris helms our live blog, with Billy Munday reporting from the King Power
  Stadium.
