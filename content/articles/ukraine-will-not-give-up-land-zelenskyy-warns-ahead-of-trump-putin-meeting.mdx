  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said early on Saturday that “Ukrainians will not
  give their land to occupiers” after Donald Trump said he would meet Vladimir
  Putin next week and that an end to the war must involve “some swapping of
  territories”. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was ready for real solutions
  that could bring peace but that any solutions without Ukraine would be against
  peace. “Any decisions against us, any decisions without Ukraine, are also
  decisions against peace. They will achieve nothing,” he said, adding that the
  war “cannot be ended without us, without Ukraine”. Trump said he planned to
  meet the Russian president next Friday in Alaska. He announced the location in
  a brief post on his Truth Social site. Russian state media agency Tass
  confirmed the date and location of the meeting, citing Kremlin aide Yury
  Ushakov. Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters in the White House the
  meeting “would have been sooner, but I guess there’s security arrangements
  that unfortunately people have to make”. The US president also said “there’ll
  be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both” Ukraine and Russia
  and that the issue would be discussed soon but he gave no further details.
  Bloomberg reported on Friday that the deal could cement some of Putin’s
  territorial gains in Ukraine, in effect freezing the battle lines in the
  Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in
  their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian
  control. US and Russian officials were working on a deal under which Russia
  would halt its offensive in exchange for the territorial concessions – making
  it a politically fraught proposal in Ukraine, Bloomberg said. Trump’s comments
  came after Poland’s prime minister said a “freeze” in the conflict could be
  close, after speaking with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has
  communicated with Trump and European leaders in recent days. “There are
  certain signals, and we also have an intuition, that perhaps a freeze in the
  conflict – I don’t want to say the end, but a freeze in the conflict – is
  closer than it is further away,” Donald Tusk said during a news conference.
  “There are hopes for this.” Tusk said Zelenskyy was “very cautious but
  optimistic” about the ceasefire, Reuters reported. Ukraine was keen that
  Poland and other European countries play a role in planning for a ceasefire
  and an eventual peace settlement, Tusk said. Trump has previously expressed
  his readiness to meet Putin one on one without preconditions, including direct
  negotiations between Putin and Zelenskyy, stoking fears that Ukraine may be
  left out of negotiations for the framework of a potential ceasefire. If the
  summit happens, it would be the first US-Russia summit since 2021, when former
  president Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva. Zelenskyy has responded by speaking
  with European leaders including the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the
  French president, Emmanuel Macron, who are key conduits to Trump. The US envoy
  Steve Witkoff had proposed a three-way meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy
  but the Kremlin had ignored that suggestion, said the Putin aide Yuri Ushakov,
  and was “focusing on preparations for a bilateral meeting with Trump in the
  first place”. Putin has said he is not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even as the
  Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a bilateral summit with Trump
  next week. “I have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but certain
  conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a meeting with Zelenskyy.
  “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating such conditions.” Last
  month, Trump issued an ultimatum for Putin to agree to a ceasefire or face
  secondary sanctions with the deadline set for this Friday. That deadline
  appeared in place despite plans for the summit, although the White House has
  not said what secondary measures it could enforce. Trump did target India with
  a 25% tariff hike for purchasing Russian oil this week, singling out one of
  Moscow’s economic enablers in a move that New Delhi complained was unfair and
  selective. Trump had grown frustrated with Putin in public in recent months as
  the war dragged through its third year and Putin continued to launch nightly
  missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities despite Trump’s insistence that
  he could strike a deal within 24 hours of becoming president. “Putin … talks
  nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said last month. “So
  there’s a little bit of a problem there.”
