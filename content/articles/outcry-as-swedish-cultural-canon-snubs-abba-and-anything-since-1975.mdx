  The Gustav Vasa 1541 bible, Pippi Longstocking, Ikea, the right to roam,
  paternity leave, Sámi joiks, the Nobel prize and works by Ingmar Bergman and
  August Strindberg all made it into Sweden’s long-awaited, much-criticised
  proposal for a “cultural canon”. However, notable omissions from the list of
  100 works and references that have formed Sweden’s culture and history –
  intended, its creators said in Uppsala on Tuesday, to establish a “shared map
  and compass” for Swedish citizens and new arrivals to Sweden – included Abba
  and anything from after 1975, a period that has seen Sweden transform into an
  international, multicultural society. Critics have accused the canon of being
  a “nationalist education project”. In response, its committee chair, the
  historian Lars Trägårdh, said that Sweden needs to embrace “democratic
  nationalism”, telling Swedish television last week that since the second world
  war Swedish culture had been characterised by modernism, internationalism and
  multiculturalism. “They have turned their gaze away from Swedish culture and
  the Swedish nation,” he told SVT’s 30 Minutes. The list is divided into 11
  categories, including poems, music, economy, religion and inventions, and
  encompasses places, laws and even concepts. It features Lilla Hyttnäs, the
  cottage in Darlarna that belonged to artists Karin and Carl Larsson; Hilma af
  Klint’s Målningar till templet (Paintings for the temple); Stockholm city
  hall, designed by Ragnar Östberg; and two songs by Gothenburg troubadour Evert
  Taube. It also takes in cross-country ski race Vasaloppet, Systema naturae by
  naturalist Carl von Linné, Kakelungnen (a popular 18th century heating stove)
  and Lappkodicillen, the 1751 agreement that recognised that Sámi people have
  the right to move freely between Sweden and Norway. With the exception of one
  of Sweden’s first synagogues, Marstrand, the religion category is dominated by
  Christian entries, despite Sweden’s Muslim population. It does, however,
  include Nattvardsgästerna (Winter Light), Bergman’s 1963 film about a priest
  in existential crisis, and the Swedish church’s 1958 decision to allow women
  to be priests. The Swedish Arabic news site Alkompis noted that the list did
  not include any Islamic landmarks. “Sweden’s first mosque, Nasir Mosque, was
  built in Gothenburg in 1976, 49 years ago,” it said. The decision to create a
  Swedish cultural canon was part of the coalition agreement for the
  Moderates-led government, which depends on the support of the far-right Sweden
  Democrats. The project has been the subject of heated debate ever since the
  investigation was commissioned in 2023, and has been criticised by the Swedish
  Academy, the Swedish Writers’ Association and members of Sweden’s national
  minorities, a group which includes Indigenous Sámi people. Additionally, the
  committee invited the public to create an online “people’s canon” which
  received about 10,000 submissions, including rapper Silvana Imam, whose music
  includes songs protesting against racism and the far-right Sweden Democrats,
  and the kebab pizza, one of Sweden’s favourite dishes. Neither features in the
  official canon. Trägårdh said at a press conference at Uppsala University on
  Tuesday that Sweden’s canon should be a “moving object” to be regularly
  updated and “something that creates rich possibilities for all to be
  successful people in modern Swedish society.” Marlen Eskander, the founder of
  the Reading Promotion Institute, who left the committee last year, described
  the canon as “very exclusionary”. “Setting a 50-year limit is deliberately
  excluding contemporary experiences,” she told news outlet Svenska Dagbladet,
  adding that Sweden had undergone huge changes since 1975. Anita Kitok, head of
  language and culture for Sametinget, Sweden’s Sámi parliament, said:
  “Sametinget has not been involved in the cultural canon so I do not have any
  comments about the result or the process.” The canon announcement comes at a
  time of heightened identity politics in Sweden that have seen the far-right
  flourish amid an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment, in part through nostalgic
  messaging and by connecting immigration and criminality, which has since
  become a mainstream narrative. The Swedish culture minister, Parisa
  Liljestrand, rejected criticism of the project, saying: “The canon project has
  been attributed with intentions that never existed anywhere else except
  possibly in the critics’ imagination.” She denied that the canon marked a
  victory for the Sweden Democrats’ culture politics. “That is the absolutely
  worst way to see this. This is a project that is about inclusion,” she said.
  One critic said the outcome was “laughable”. “You can’t get away from the
  thought that AI could have suggested it,” wrote Björn Wiman in Dagens Nyheter.
