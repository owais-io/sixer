  Pegula’s victory wraps up the day session on Arthur Ashe, so most eyes are on
  Louis Armstrong, where Shelton is drinking in the applause of his home crowd
  as he breaks Mannarino after a quite remarkable point to take a two sets to
  one lead. Shelton looked down and out … but somehow scrambles to gets a
  defensive forehand back which lands bang on the sideline … and Mannarino,
  probably not expecting the ball to come back at him, nets! Shelton leads 6-3,
  3-6, 6-4. Pegula is so consistent – this is the fourth successive year she’s
  reached the fourth round or better – but does she have enough to beat the very
  best? She tends to defeat the players she should and lose to the ones she’s
  expected to – that said, she did have a couple of unexpected losses in the the
  buildup to this tournament, so she’ll be happy to have reached the second week
  with relative ease. As for Azarenka, she’s had some great moments on Arthur
  Ashe, having reached the final three times, the last time in 2020, but the
  36-year-old won’t have today’s match on her New York showreel. Pegula is asked
  how she snatched that second set: I just tried to focus on going back to my
  strategy, things that were working well in the first set. I felt like I could
  still dig out the set for sure. I moved well, scrambled well, we train
  together in Florida so we know each other’s games so well. I could tell she
  was struggling physically so I wanted to keep her moving. Azarenka can’t get
  the ball into play. Four errant shots under pressure and Pegula holds to love.
  From a break and 5-4 down, Pegula now leads 6-5 and will be hoping to get this
  done in two sets. She’s two points away at 30-all on Azarenka’s serve – you’d
  say Azarenka deserves a tie-break for her efforts in this set while struggling
  with a left leg injury – but a tired forehand into the net gives Pegula match
  point. Azarenka’s second serve is soft, Pegula pounces on the return and
  Azarenka chops into the net. Pegula wins the battle of the former US Open
  finalists and is yet to drop a set this tournament. As for Azarenka v Pegula,
  no sooner does Azarenka break, than she is broken serving for the second set.
  She’ll be kicking herself having worked so hard to get back into the match.
  It’s 5-5, after Pegula took the opener 6-1. Thanks Rob. What a win that was
  for Vondrousova – remarkably her first against a top-10 opponent at a slam
  since her Wimbledon triumph in 2023. The Czech has been through so much since,
  including shoulder surgery and getting divorced, and she’ll next face another
  resurgent former Wimbledon champion in the last 16, Elena Rybakina. As for
  Paolini, having reached two slam finals last year, she’ll be disappointed not
  to go beyond the fourth round at a major this season. But it was always going
  to be so, so tough to match her breakout 2024. Now it’s Pegula making the
  glaring errors, but can Azarenka capitalise and keep the match alive? She
  breaks to move 5-4 ahead in the second set and I’ll hand back to Katy to take
  you through to the end of the set – or match. Thanks for your time. Azarenka
  has found some form out of nowhere and suddenly is asking questions of Pegula.
  But two badly timed double faults on deuce prove costly. The Belarusian loses
  a hard-fought service game and it is 4-4 in the second set. The American’s
  form dipped dramatically after she won the first set but she is looking
  stronger again now. Mannarino wins the second set against Shelton 6-3 to level
  the match. The Frenchman has turned things round and is right in this
  absorbing contest now. That is mighty impressive stuff from Vondrousova who
  has fallen down the rankings after injury. Sad to see Paolini go but the No 7
  seed will be back in the doubles. Paolini loses her serve against Vondrousova
  to slip to the brink of defeat. She trails 5-1 in the second set and her hopes
  of recovering look forlorn. Elise Mertens is 29 now and a former world No 1 in
  doubles. Her singles history is less impressive, but she has take the first
  set against Cristina Bucsa 6-3. Paolini is in real trouble here against
  Vondrousova. She has been broken already in the second set and is 4-1 down
  having lost the first set tie-break. Azarenka looks like she is battling an
  injured leg. And her ball toss is all over the place. But she hobbled through
  that service game to level the second set up at 1-1 against Pegula. Over on
  Louis Armstrong, Mannarino has turned things around against Shelton after
  losing the first set. He’s 3-0 up in the second with a break and looking good.
  Thanks Katy. A pleasure to be with you all tonight. Maybe my presence can
  bring an upturn in fortune for Azarenka. She is looking so frustrated at the
  moment … Pegula, meanwhile, has charged through the first set 6-1 against
  Azarenka. With that, I’m off to grab some food. Rob is here to keep you
  company … Paolini’s smile is gone as Vondrousova moves 2-0 and then 4-1 ahead
  despite a miscued lob from the Czech. Paolini reduces her arrears to 4-2 at
  the change of ends … but Vondrousova is such a canny competitor, with her mix
  of spins and slice, and it’s very quickly 6-2. Paolini pelts a winner to save
  the first set point … and is then absolutely pounding the ball at poor
  Vondrousova at the net on the second. So it’s 6-4 … and then first set
  Vondrousova when Paolini rams into the tramlines! The Italian is screaming at
  herself. Vondrousova looks so calm. Like Alcaraz, Paolini plays with so much
  joy and energy, and while she hasn’t quite hit the heights that she did in her
  breakout 2024 when she reached two slam finals, she’s still had a very solid
  season. She gets to 30 on Vondrousova’s serve but can go no further, so we’re
  into a tie-break. Vondrousova holds for 5-5. Paolini nudges ahead to 6-5. And
  speaking of Paolini, this is well worth a look (and read): Paolini is pushing
  at 5-4 and deuce on Vondrousova’s serve. A 21-shot rally ends in Vondrousova’s
  favour. Phew. Meanwhile Pegula is already in charge against Azarenka, leading
  4-1. Shelton has had a strong summer, following up his quarter-final run at
  Wimbledon by winning his first Masters 1000 title, in Toronto, and he’s
  serving for the first set at 5-3. At a career-high world ranking of No 6, the
  22-year-old could be a real contender this fortnight, at a tournament where
  he’s already reached the last four, and he’s got his game face on as he serves
  out the set to 15. An ominous stat for Mannarino: the 37-year-old is 0-22
  against top-10 players at majors. It’s all-change on the show courts. Just
  starting under the roof on Arthur Ashe it’s Jessica Pegula, last year’s
  runner-up, against the three-times finalist Victoria Azarenka. On Louis
  Armstrong, Pegula’s fellow American Ben Shelton leads 4-2 in the battle of the
  young lefty vs the veteran French lefty Adrian Mannarino, while on Grandstand
  it’s Jasmine Paolini against the former Wimbledon champ Marketa Vondrousova.
  It’s 3-3 in the opening set. I wish I had six eyes but two will have to do.
  Rinderknech is on his knees as he completes a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over
  his good friend. It’s a landmark win for the 30-year-old, who’s through to the
  fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. His prize/punishment is a
  last-16 meeting with Alcaraz. It’s raining on one side of Flushing Meadows but
  not the other. Rinderknech is now a game away, leading 5-2, with Bonzi serving
  at 30-all. And Britain’s Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter have just booked their
  place in the second round of the women’s doubles. Raducanu’s been speaking to
  Sky’s Laura Robson after being outclassed by Rybakina: It was very difficult.
  I didn’t get a chance to settle or feel any rhythm. But overall I think I’m
  heading in the right direction. It’s been a good swing in America. After
  Wimbledon I was straight into practice and I had some good results but against
  the top players I’ve got a lot of work to do. I look forward to heading out to
  Asia. Dark clouds are hanging over Court 17 as Rinderknech moves to within two
  games of victory against Bonzi. And it’s got nothing to do with being the US
  Open’s “hash court”, but rather the ominous weather. He’ll hope he can
  complete the win over his fellow Frenchman before the possible showers come.
  About 14,529 fans descend on Alcaraz for an autograph. Meanwhile news of
  another winner: Jiri Lehecka, the 20th seed, has ended the run of Belgium’s
  Raphael Collignon, who conquered Casper Ruud in the previous round on his US
  Open debut. Collignon said that was the best day of his life – but today came
  nowhere near to hitting those heights, as he lost 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Alcaraz
  speaks: I’m not used to playing early, so my goal was to start focused. I
  think I did pretty well, and after that I kept it going. Great performance, so
  I’m proud about it. I’m not an early person so for me it’s difficult, but I
  played good. I felt something in my knee [when he called for the physio], but
  after five, six points it was gone. Darderi is serving to stay in the match.
  0-15. 0-30. 0-40, as Alcaraz comes up with a return to take the breath away.
  Darderi takes the next point for 15-40, but almost seemed halfway to the net
  to shake Alcaraz’s hand. He knows his time is nearly up. So he’s going for
  broke. It’s an approach that gets him to deuce, but Alcaraz creates a fourth
  match point, and this time Darderi hits long! Alcaraz whizzes into round four
  for the loss of only six games. He again opts for his golf swing celebration.
  Darderi looks as if he’s had enough. He’s broken again, this time to 15, as
  Alcaraz fizzes a forehand winner. It’s 4-zip. Darderi then goes for broke with
  Alcaraz leading 40-0 on serve, as the Italian crushes and rushes on his way to
  hauling himself to deuce. But Alcaraz sees the game through from there. It’s
  6-2, 6-4, 5-0. The Arthur Ashe court is turning into quicksand for Darderi as
  he drops 3-0 down in the third. Alcaraz is a few games away from what would be
  a third straight-sets win on the spin. His most likely fourth-round opponent
  is Rinderknech, who is two sets to one up on Bonzi. Bonzi defeated the
  self-combusting Daniil Medvedev in the first round, as he did at Wimbledon in
  June, but he’ll have to take this to five if he’s to progress any further. You
  wouldn’t know Alcaraz has just received treatment for a knee issue. Because he
  jumps out of his chair and swiftly works his way to two set points at 15-40 on
  Darderi’s serve. And an inopportune double fault from Darderi gifts the second
  set to Alcaraz. The world No 2 leads 6-2, 6-4. More bad news for Britain after
  Raducanu’s exit: Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, the top seeds and Wimbledon
  champions, have lost in the first round of the men’s doubles. I should have
  said that Raducanu’s defeat means British interest in the women’s singles is
  over, with Cameron Norrie the sole survivor in the men’s singles. And Norrie
  has the task of facing Novak Djokovic in the night session, though he will be
  encouraged by Djokovic’s slightly shaky performance in the second round.
  Alcaraz has called for the trainer. He’s got some pain in his right knee. He
  says he doesn’t want any tape, so instead is having a massage on his quad to
  see if it’ll loosen things up. Darderi, after the high of the previous game,
  struggles to focus on serve, and is soon break point down. The 23-year-old
  (he’s a year older than Alcaraz, despite the gulf in grand slam experience)
  saves it, but very quickly has to fend off another. This time he does it with
  an ace. And from there he gamely holds for 4-4. Plenty of oohs and aaahs from
  the biggest crowd in tennis as Darderi turns into Alcaraz, becoming the
  showman as he dives to the drop shot and Alcaraz goes wide. Quite possibly the
  point of the match. And the biggest surprise of the match, as the Italian goes
  on to break! It’s the first time this tournament that Alcaraz has been broken,
  and they’re back on serve in the second set, but Alcaraz still leads 6-2, 4-3.
  Meanwhile the man with the biggest smile in tennis, Carlos Alcaraz, is doing
  to Luciano Darderi what he did in the first set, and now leads 6-2, 4-1.
  Despite his five slam titles, he can be prone to lapses in concentration, but
  he’s been locked in here from the start and appears well set for a
  fourth-round meeting with Benjamin Bonzi or Arthur Rinderknech. The French
  pair are locked at one set all. I think the disappointing thing for Raducanu
  today was that she’ll know she could have played better. Yes, she’s struggled
  against the top, top players in the past, but the way she took it to Aryna
  Sabalenka at Wimbledon and in Cincinnati marked real progress, which was
  halted today. But progress is rarely linear – Raducanu of all people knows
  that, with all the knocks she’s had during her career. Hopefully she can still
  build on the positives from her summer; it’s been good to see her playing with
  a smile again, that’s for sure. An email. “Raducanu is ranked around 35 and I
  feel that is accurate,” writes Mary Waltz. “She is still young and has room
  for improvement. She can have a long career but I don’t see her as regular
  top-10 player or major tournament winner. No shame in that.” Raducanu leaves
  court in double quick time. Rybakina, meanwhile, says in her interview she’s
  really happy with how she played and that the scoreline didn’t reflect how
  tough Raducanu is as competitor. She admits she doesn’t know why she hasn’t
  gone far at the US Open before, but hopes this year will be different. The
  interview takes an unexpected turn when she’s asked about her love of
  rollercoasters – not that she experienced one today – the match was always
  going only one way. Alcaraz meanwhile, having conceded only two points on
  serve so far, leads Darderi 5-2. And here are three set points on the
  Italian’s serve. Darderi nets. Alcaraz has the first set in 30 minutes … as
  Rybakina completes victory in just 62, when Raducanu’s return flies long. A
  humbling day for Raducanu, having had such a promising summer. For Rybakina,
  surprisingly, this is the first time she’s reached the fourth round in New
  York … and on this form she can go deep. Next she’ll face either Jasmine
  Paolini or Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu, from 15-all on her serve, slides
  15-40 down. Which may as well be two match points. The pair get into a
  cross-court exchange … Rybkina hits just wide. And then nets her return!
  Raducanu puffs out her cheeks in relief; she’ll be hoping those two missed
  chances will play on her opponent’s mind. But from deuce, Raducanu is dragged
  out of court and Rybakina then hits a winner into the open space. And
  Raducanu’s cross-court forehand skids into the tramlines. Rybakina will serve
  for the match at 6-1, 5-2. Not that the crowd are cheering; they wanted a
  match here. But it’s gone by in the blink of an eye. Or more accurately 58
  minutes. Raducanu wins a rare point on the Rybakina second serve for 15-all.
  But then a short ball is swatted away for 30-15. Roig is trying to encourage
  Raducanu to take a few steps back and give herself more time on the ball. His
  plea works; it’s soon 30-all. But Rybakina rams an ace down the T and then
  Raducanu drops a tame ball into the centre of the court and Rybakina has
  plenty of time to take aim and whack a forehand winner. It’s 6-1, 4-2. A nice
  bit of play from Raducanu, as she hits back behind Rybakina, catching the
  Kazakhstani off guard, to secure a hold to 30. The problem is, at 6-1, 3-2
  down, she’s starting to run out of chances to break. Make that 3-0 Alcaraz.
  He’s looking as sharp as his haircut. And Rybakina. Rybakina rips a few more
  winners and it’s 6-1, 3-1. Meanwhile Carlos Alcaraz is doing what Carlos
  Alcaraz does, and the 2022 champion (was it really three years ago?!) has
  broken for a 2-0 lead in the opening set. Raducanu duly listens to our Tim,
  and has a little spring in her step as she heads back to her chair having held
  courtesy of a couple of winners. Can she build on it? The problem is, this
  match is still very much on Rybakina’s racket. For all the inconsistency
  Rybakina has shown during her career, when she’s playing at her best, few can
  live with her; she’s up there with Sabalenka and Swiatek. Ach. Raducanu, from
  40-0 up on serve at the start of the second set, makes a flurry of errors and
  that’s another break. She desperately needed to steady herself in this match,
  but Rybakina consolidates the break and is 6-1, 2-0 ahead. “Only 37 minutes on
  the clock but you think the next game is must-win for Raducanu,” says Henman,
  as Raducanu’s latest coach Francisco Roig offers some encouragement from the
  sidelines. Rybakina is seeing the ball like a football out there. She’s barely
  missing. But Raducanu is playing a lot into the centre of the court; perhaps
  she’ll have more success if she gets Rybakina on the move. She needs to try
  something different, that’s for sure. Meanwhile Carlos Alcaraz and that
  buzzcut have arrived on Arthur Ashe. His victim opponent today is the Italian
  32nd seed Luciano Darderi. This game follows the first-set script as Rybakina
  moves to 40-30, set point. But then she throws in a double! A glimmer,
  perhaps, for Raducanu. But Raducanu can’t make the most of the reprieve. She
  bashes a backhand return into the net on the second set point and it’s been a
  near-rout for Rybakina, who leads 6-1. Raducanu gets on the board as a
  forehand winner seals a hold to 15. That’ll have felt good. But Rybakina,
  undeterred, swiftly holds to 15 herself amid a flurry of errant forehands from
  Raducanu. Rybakina has this way of looking so calm, composed and effortless,
  while also being so powerful and destructive. And that’s exactly how she gets
  herself a double break. It’s 5-1. After just 22 minutes, the ninth seed will
  serve for the opening set. And we’ve also got these two pieces on US Open
  stoners and dating shows. Not a sentence I thought I’d ever type. As usual,
  please do get in touch with your predictions/predilections. Or with anything
  I’ve missed. I’ve been on holiday the past couple of weeks (the west coast of
  Scotland – so beautiful!), so I’m playing a bit of catch-up. And talking of
  playing catch-up, here’s what happened on day five: Raducanu dropped only six
  games in her first two matches. But both were against qualifiers; Rybakina,
  the 2022 Wimbledon champ, represents a huge step up in quality. Raducanu has
  tended to struggle against the biggest hitters – and is letting Rybakina
  dictate early on here – but the way in which she stood up to Aryna Sabalenka
  in two tight defeats at Wimbledon and Cincinnati this summer will give her
  hope. But Rybakina backs up the break and it’s 3-0. Rybakina underlines why
  she’s the best server in the women’s game with some pinpoint deliveries to get
  to 40-15 in the opening game. The Russia-born Kazakhstani then misfires from
  the baseline, but holds to 30 when Raducanu rattles her return long. Rybakina
  bosses the next game too, charging to 0-40 and three break points. Raducanu
  repels the first, Rybakina blinks on the second but makes no mistake on the
  third. Raducanu drops serve for the first time at this US Open and it’s 2-0.
  Also getting going: Jiri Lehecka, the Czech 20th seed, against Belgium’s
  Raphael Collignon, the conqueror of Casper Ruud; and the all-French affair
  between Benjamin Bonzi and Arthur Rinderknech. On Sky, Tim Henman is backing
  the Brit, but reckons it’ll go to three sets. Marion Bartoli is also going
  with Raducanu. Big call. The head-to-head doesn’t help us much: ER has met ER
  only once before, back in 2022, though Rybakina did thrash Raducanu 6-0, 6-1.
  The pair have plenty of respect for each other and played doubles together
  last month in Washington DC. Raducanu, all smiles, steps on to court, just
  ahead of Rybakina. The British No 1 has looked so happy and relaxed this week,
  having finally won her first matches at the US Open since that unlikely 2021
  triumph. Rybakina, surprisingly given her pedigree as a former Wimbledon
  champion, has never been beyond the third round in New York. The pair are
  warming up, which should give you just about enough time to read Tumaini’s
  preview: Good afternoon/morning/evening depending on your worldly whereabouts
  and welcome to our day six coverage of the US Open as the third round begins.
  Now the pre-match pleasantries are out of the way, we better cut straight to
  the chase, because Emma Raducanu is about to get going against Elena Rybakina
  on Louis Armstrong. Carlos Alcaraz will make his entrance on Arthur Ashe in
  about half an hour. The American contingent of Ben Shelton, Jessica Pegula,
  Frances Tiafoe and Emma Navarro are also in action in the day session as the
  Labor Day weekend gets under way, along with Jasmine Paolini and the former
  finalist Victoria Azarenka. Let’s do this!

Pegula’s victory wraps up the day session on Arthur Ashe, so most eyes are on Louis Armstrong, where Shelton is drinking in the applause of his home crowd as he breaks Mannarino after a quite remarkable point to take a two sets to one lead. Shelton looked down and out … but somehow scrambles to gets a defensive forehand back which lands bang on the sideline … and Mannarino, probably not expecting the ball to come back at him, nets! Shelton leads 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Pegula is so consistent – this is the fourth successive year she’s reached the fourth round or better – but does she have enough to beat the very best? She tends to defeat the players she should and lose to the ones she’s expected to – that said, she did have a couple of unexpected losses in the the buildup to this tournament, so she’ll be happy to have reached the second week with relative ease. As for Azarenka, she’s had some great moments on Arthur Ashe, having reached the final three times, the last time in 2020, but the 36-year-old won’t have today’s match on her New York showreel. Pegula is asked how she snatched that second set: I just tried to focus on going back to my strategy, things that were working well in the first set.

Azarenka has found some form out of nowhere and suddenly is asking questions of Pegula. But two badly timed double faults on deuce prove costly. The Belarusian loses a hard-fought service game and it is 4-4 in the second set. The American’s form dipped dramatically after she won the first set but she is looking stronger again now. Mannarino wins the second set against Shelton 6-3 to level the match. The Frenchman has turned things round and is right in this absorbing contest now.

A pleasure to be with you all tonight. Maybe my presence can bring an upturn in fortune for Azarenka.

So it’s 6-4 … and then first set Vondrousova when Paolini rams into the tramlines! The Italian is screaming at herself. Vondrousova looks so calm. Like Alcaraz, Paolini plays with so much joy and energy, and while she hasn’t quite hit the heights that she did in her breakout 2024 when she reached two slam finals, she’s still had a very solid season. She gets to 30 on Vondrousova’s serve but can go no further, so we’re into a tie-break. Vondrousova holds for 5-5. Paolini nudges ahead to 6-5. And speaking of Paolini, this is well worth a look (and read): Paolini is pushing at 5-4 and deuce on Vondrousova’s serve. A 21-shot rally ends in Vondrousova’s favour. Phew. Meanwhile Pegula is already in charge against Azarenka, leading 4-1. Shelton has had a strong summer, following up his quarter-final run at Wimbledon by winning his first Masters 1000 title, in Toronto, and he’s serving for the first set at 5-3. At a career-high world ranking of No 6, the 22-year-old could be a real contender this fortnight, at a tournament where he’s already reached the last four, and he’s got his game face on as he serves out the set to 15. An ominous stat for Mannarino: the 37-year-old is 0-22 against top-10 players at majors. It’s all-change on the show courts. Just starting under the roof on Arthur Ashe it’s Jessica Pegula, last year’s runner-up, against the three-times finalist Victoria Azarenka. On Louis Armstrong, Pegula’s fellow American Ben Shelton leads 4-2 in the battle of the young lefty vs the veteran French lefty Adrian Mannarino, while on Grandstand it’s Jasmine Paolini against the former Wimbledon champ Marketa Vondrousova. It’s 3-3 in the opening set. I wish I had six eyes but two will have to do. Rinderknech is on his knees as he completes a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over his good friend. It’s a landmark win for the 30-year-old, who’s through to the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. His prize/punishment is a last-16 meeting with Alcaraz. It’s raining on one side of Flushing Meadows but not the other. Rinderknech is now a game away, leading 5-2, with Bonzi serving at 30-all. And Britain’s Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter have just booked their place in the second round of the women’s doubles. Raducanu’s been speaking to Sky’s Laura Robson after being outclassed by Rybakina: It was very difficult. I didn’t get a chance to settle or feel any rhythm. But overall I think I’m heading in the right direction. It’s been a good swing in America. After Wimbledon I was straight into practice and I had some good results but against the top players I’ve got a lot of work to do. I look forward to heading out to Asia. Dark clouds are hanging over Court 17 as Rinderknech moves to within two games of victory against Bonzi. And it’s got nothing to do with being the US Open’s “hash court”, but rather the ominous weather. He’ll hope he can complete the win over his fellow Frenchman before the possible showers come. About 14,529 fans descend on Alcaraz for an autograph. Meanwhile news of another winner: Jiri Lehecka, the 20th seed, has ended the run of Belgium’s Raphael Collignon, who conquered Casper Ruud in the previous round on his US Open debut. Collignon said that was the best day of his life – but today came nowhere near to hitting those heights, as he lost 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Alcaraz speaks: I’m not used to playing early, so my goal was to start focused. I think I did pretty well, and after that I kept it going. Great performance, so I’m proud about it. I’m not an early person so for me it’s difficult, but I played good. I felt something in my knee [when he called for the physio], but after five, six points it was gone. Darderi is serving to stay in the match. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40, as Alcaraz comes up with a return to take the breath away. Darderi takes the next point for 15-40, but almost seemed halfway to the net to shake Alcaraz’s hand. He knows his time is nearly up. So he’s going for broke. It’s an approach that gets him to deuce, but Alcaraz creates a fourth match point, and this time Darderi hits long! Alcaraz whizzes into round four for the loss of only six games. He again opts for his golf swing celebration. Darderi looks as if he’s had enough. He’s broken again, this time to 15, as Alcaraz fizzes a forehand winner. It’s 4-zip. Darderi then goes for broke with Alcaraz leading 40-0 on serve, as the Italian crushes and rushes on his way to hauling himself to deuce. But Alcaraz sees the game through from there. It’s 6-2, 6-4, 5-0. The Arthur Ashe court is turning into quicksand for Darderi as he drops 3-0 down in the third. Alcaraz is a few games away from what would be a third straight-sets win on the spin. His most likely fourth-round opponent is Rinderknech, who is two sets to one up on Bonzi. Bonzi defeated the self-combusting Daniil Medvedev in the first round, as he did at Wimbledon in June, but he’ll have to take this to five if he’s to progress any further. You wouldn’t know Alcaraz has just received treatment for a knee issue. Because he jumps out of his chair and swiftly works his way to two set points at 15-40 on Darderi’s serve. And an inopportune double fault from Darderi gifts the second set to Alcaraz. The world No 2 leads 6-2, 6-4. More bad news for Britain after Raducanu’s exit: Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, the top seeds and Wimbledon champions, have lost in the first round of the men’s doubles. I should have said that Raducanu’s defeat means British interest in the women’s singles is over, with Cameron Norrie the sole survivor in the men’s singles. And Norrie has the task of facing Novak Djokovic in the night session, though he will be encouraged by Djokovic’s slightly shaky performance in the second round. Alcaraz has called for the trainer. He’s got some pain in his right knee. He says he doesn’t want any tape, so instead is having a massage on his quad to see if it’ll loosen things up. Darderi, after the high of the previous game, struggles to focus on serve, and is soon break point down. The 23-year-old (he’s a year older than Alcaraz, despite the gulf in grand slam experience) saves it, but very quickly has to fend off another. This time he does it with an ace. And from there he gamely holds for 4-4. Plenty of oohs and aaahs from the biggest crowd in tennis as Darderi turns into Alcaraz, becoming the showman as he dives to the drop shot and Alcaraz goes wide. Quite possibly the point of the match. And the biggest surprise of the match, as the Italian goes on to break! It’s the first time this tournament that Alcaraz has been broken, and they’re back on serve in the second set, but Alcaraz still leads 6-2, 4-3. Meanwhile the man with the biggest smile in tennis, Carlos Alcaraz, is doing to Luciano Darderi what he did in the first set, and now leads 6-2, 4-1. Despite his five slam titles, he can be prone to lapses in concentration, but he’s been locked in here from the start and appears well set for a fourth-round meeting with Benjamin Bonzi or Arthur Rinderknech. The French pair are locked at one set all. I think the disappointing thing for Raducanu today was that she’ll know she could have played better. Yes, she’s struggled against the top, top players in the past, but the way she took it to Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon and in Cincinnati marked real progress, which was halted today. But progress is rarely linear – Raducanu of all people knows that, with all the knocks she’s had during her career. Hopefully she can still build on the positives from her summer; it’s been good to see her playing with a smile again, that’s for sure. An email. “Raducanu is ranked around 35 and I feel that is accurate,” writes Mary Waltz. “She is still young and has room for improvement. She can have a long career but I don’t see her as regular top-10 player or major tournament winner. No shame in that.” Raducanu leaves court in double quick time. Rybakina, meanwhile, says in her interview she’s really happy with how she played and that the scoreline didn’t reflect how tough Raducanu is as competitor. She admits she doesn’t know why she hasn’t gone far at the US Open before, but hopes this year will be different. The interview takes an unexpected turn when she’s asked about her love of rollercoasters – not that she experienced one today – the match was always going only one way. Alcaraz meanwhile, having conceded only two points on serve so far, leads Darderi 5-2. And here are three set points on the Italian’s serve. Darderi nets. Alcaraz has the first set in 30 minutes … as Rybakina completes victory in just 62, when Raducanu’s return flies long. A humbling day for Raducanu, having had such a promising summer. For Rybakina, surprisingly, this is the first time she’s reached the fourth round in New York … and on this form she can go deep. Next she’ll face either Jasmine Paolini or Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu, from 15-all on her serve, slides 15-40 down. Which may as well be two match points. The pair get into a cross-court exchange … Rybkina hits just wide. And then nets her return! Raducanu puffs out her cheeks in relief; she’ll be hoping those two missed chances will play on her opponent’s mind. But from deuce, Raducanu is dragged out of court and Rybakina then hits a winner into the open space. And Raducanu’s cross-court forehand skids into the tramlines. Rybakina will serve for the match at 6-1, 5-2. Not that the crowd are cheering; they wanted a match here. But it’s gone by in the blink of an eye. Or more accurately 58 minutes. Raducanu wins a rare point on the Rybakina second serve for 15-all. But then a short ball is swatted away for 30-15. Roig is trying to encourage Raducanu to take a few steps back and give herself more time on the ball. His plea works; it’s soon 30-all. But Rybakina rams an ace down the T and then Raducanu drops a tame ball into the centre of the court and Rybakina has plenty of time to take aim and whack a forehand winner. It’s 6-1, 4-2. A nice bit of play from Raducanu, as she hits back behind Rybakina, catching the Kazakhstani off guard, to secure a hold to 30. The problem is, at 6-1, 3-2 down, she’s starting to run out of chances to break. Make that 3-0 Alcaraz. He’s looking as sharp as his haircut. And Rybakina. Rybakina rips a few more winners and it’s 6-1, 3-1. Meanwhile Carlos Alcaraz is doing what Carlos Alcaraz does, and the 2022 champion (was it really three years ago?!) has broken for a 2-0 lead in the opening set. Raducanu duly listens to our Tim, and has a little spring in her step as she heads back to her chair having held courtesy of a couple of winners. Can she build on it? The problem is, this match is still very much on Rybakina’s racket. For all the inconsistency Rybakina has shown during her career, when she’s playing at her best, few can live with her; she’s up there with Sabalenka and Swiatek. Ach. Raducanu, from 40-0 up on serve at the start of the second set, makes a flurry of errors and that’s another break. She desperately needed to steady herself in this match, but Rybakina consolidates the break and is 6-1, 2-0 ahead. “Only 37 minutes on the clock but you think the next game is must-win for Raducanu,” says Henman, as Raducanu’s latest coach Francisco Roig offers some encouragement from the sidelines. Rybakina is seeing the ball like a football out there. She’s barely missing. But Raducanu is playing a lot into the centre of the court; perhaps she’ll have more success if she gets Rybakina on the move. She needs to try something different, that’s for sure. Meanwhile Carlos Alcaraz and that buzzcut have arrived on Arthur Ashe. His victim opponent today is the Italian 32nd seed Luciano Darderi. This game follows the first-set script as Rybakina moves to 40-30, set point. But then she throws in a double! A glimmer, perhaps, for Raducanu. But Raducanu can’t make the most of the reprieve. She bashes a backhand return into the net on the second set point and it’s been a near-rout for Rybakina, who leads 6-1. Raducanu gets on the board as a forehand winner seals a hold to 15. That’ll have felt good. But Rybakina, undeterred, swiftly holds to 15 herself amid a flurry of errant forehands from Raducanu. Rybakina has this way of looking so calm, composed and effortless, while also being so powerful and destructive. And that’s exactly how she gets herself a double break. It’s 5-1. After just 22 minutes, the ninth seed will serve for the opening set. And we’ve also got these two pieces on US Open stoners and dating shows. Not a sentence I thought I’d ever type. As usual, please do get in touch with your predictions/predilections. Or with anything I’ve missed. I’ve been on holiday the past couple of weeks (the west coast of Scotland – so beautiful!), so I’m playing a bit of catch-up. And talking of playing catch-up, here’s what happened on day five: Raducanu dropped only six games in her first two matches. But both were against qualifiers; Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champ, represents a huge step up in quality. Raducanu has tended to struggle against the biggest hitters – and is letting Rybakina dictate early on here – but the way in which she stood up to Aryna Sabalenka in two tight defeats at Wimbledon and Cincinnati this summer will give her hope. But Rybakina backs up the break and it’s 3-0. Rybakina underlines why she’s the best server in the women’s game with some pinpoint deliveries to get to 40-15 in the opening game. The Russia-born Kazakhstani then misfires from the baseline, but holds to 30 when Raducanu rattles her return long. Rybakina bosses the next game too, charging to 0-40 and three break points. Raducanu repels the first, Rybakina blinks on the second but makes no mistake on the third. Raducanu drops serve for the first time at this US Open and it’s 2-0. Also getting going: Jiri Lehecka, the Czech 20th seed, against Belgium’s Raphael Collignon, the conqueror of Casper Ruud; and the all-French affair between Benjamin Bonzi and Arthur Rinderknech. On Sky, Tim Henman is backing the Brit, but reckons it’ll go to three sets. Marion Bartoli is also going with Raducanu. Big call. The head-to-head doesn’t help us much: ER has met ER only once before, back in 2022, though Rybakina did thrash Raducanu 6-0, 6-1. The pair have plenty of respect for each other and played doubles together last month in Washington DC. Raducanu, all smiles, steps on to court, just ahead of Rybakina. The British No 1 has looked so happy and relaxed this week, having finally won her first matches at the US Open since that unlikely 2021 triumph. Rybakina, surprisingly given her pedigree as a former Wimbledon champion, has never been beyond the third round in New York. The pair are warming up, which should give you just about enough time to read Tumaini’s preview: Good afternoon/morning/evening depending on your worldly whereabouts and welcome to our day six coverage of the US Open as the third round begins. Now the pre-match pleasantries are out of the way, we better cut straight to the chase, because Emma Raducanu is about to get going against Elena Rybakina on Louis Armstrong. Carlos Alcaraz will make his entrance on Arthur Ashe in about half an hour. The American contingent of Ben Shelton, Jessica Pegula, Frances Tiafoe and Emma Navarro are also in action in the day session as the Labor Day weekend gets under way, along with Jasmine Paolini and the former finalist Victoria Azarenka. Let’s do this!
