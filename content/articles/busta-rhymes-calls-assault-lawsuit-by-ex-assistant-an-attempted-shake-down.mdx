  Busta Rhymes has been accused of physical assault and an abusive work
  environment by his former assistant. The 53-year-old rapper, whose real name
  is Trevor Smith, is the focus of a lawsuit filed by Dashiel Gables who claims
  he was punched in the face for being on the phone in January. At the time
  Rhymes turned himself in and earlier this week, Gables filed an action
  alleging wage and hour violations, assault, battery and intentional infliction
  of emotional distress. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Rhymes responded:
  “I have been made aware of the claims made by Dashiel Gables, and I completely
  and categorically deny these allegations. For a very brief period, Dashiel
  assisted me, but it did not work out. Apparently, Dashiel has decided to
  respond to being let go by manufacturing claims against me in an attempt to
  attack and damage my reputation. I look forward to proving these allegations
  false, and am preparing a countersuit, which I am confident will expose this
  for what it is – an attempted shake-down by a disgruntled former assistant.
  Ultimately, I am certain the truth will prevail.” Gables started working for
  Rhymes in 2024 for $200 a day and during his tenure, claims that the star
  would degrade him, scream and spit at him and make unreasonable demands to
  himself and other employees, often making him work 18-hour days without
  overtime. In January 2025, Gables alleges that while in the lobby of the
  rapper’s residence, the pair were engaged in an argument. Gables’ daughter
  called and he ignored it, sending her a text message instead. Rhymes
  reportedly screamed at him and then punched him twice. Gables was hospitalised
  and filed a police report and Rhymes faced three assault charges. “While
  plaintiff tolerated a great deal of abuse while working for Busta Rhymes, he
  could not tolerate the repeated physical assault and was unable to return to
  work,” the lawsuit reads. He then claims as a result of the assault and the
  police report, he was “frozen out of the hip-hop music industry” and faces
  “substantial future lost wage damages” as a result. “I worked my heart out for
  Busta,” Gables said in a statement sent to the Guardian. “Long hours, day and
  night, weekends, you name it. He bullied me from day one. He regularly
  insulted me, called me names and slurs, screamed at me in front of other
  people … But I stuck around, because I needed the work and I thought things
  would get better. But instead, he punched me twice in the face.” In 2008,
  Rhymes pleaded guilty to charges of assault and drink-driving after he was
  accused of beating and kicking his former driver during a pay dispute while
  also attacking a fan at a festival. In 2015, he was also arrested for throwing
  a drink at a gym employee. Rhymes, whose hits include Gimme Some More and
  Break Ya Neck, recently made an appearance in The Naked Gun reboot and was
  honoured with a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.
