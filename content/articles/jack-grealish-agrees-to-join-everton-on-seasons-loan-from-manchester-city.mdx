  Jack Grealish is poised to join Everton on a season’s loan after agreeing to
  leave Manchester City in an attempt to revive his stalled career. Everton’s
  interest in the City midfielder was reciprocated over the weekend with
  Grealish accepting an opportunity to be part of the club’s first season at
  Hill Dickinson Stadium. The 29-year-old wants to move in time to feature in
  Everton’s opening game of the Premier League season at Leeds. He is due to
  begin a medical on Monday. City are looking to recoup most of Grealish’s
  £300,000-a-week wages and Everton’s outlay could exceed £12m once a loan fee
  is accounted for. City also want to include an option for a permanent
  transfer, although a suggested price of £50m appears optimistic for a player
  who will be 30 and in the final year of his contract in 12 months. City’s
  financial demands are unlikely to scupper the move, however. Grealish is
  determined to reignite his career in the Premier League before the World Cup
  next summer. The £100m signing from Aston Villa, who has had several offers to
  leave City this summer, missed out on the England squad for the 2024 European
  Championship after losing his regular first-team place under Pep Guardiola.
  The playmaker’s role has continued to decline since the high mark of City’s
  treble-winning season in 2023. He made seven Premier League starts last
  season, scoring once, and was omitted from Guardiola’s 27-man squad for the
  Club World Cup this summer. Moyes is desperate to inject more creativity into
  his side. Everton have made five signings, including Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall
  from Chelsea for £28m, but remain short of attacking options. Southampton have
  rejected three offers from Everton for Tyler Dibling, the latest at about
  £40m, and are holding out for about £50m. A right-sided forward is a priority
  for Moyes and Everton, who lost their fourth friendly of pre-season against
  Roma on Saturday, are considering alternative options to the 19-year-old.
  Nottingham Forest are closer to signing midfielder James McAtee from City. A
  bid worth £25m was rejected by City last month, but Forest have increased
  their offer. McAtee won the European Under-21 Championship with England in
  June, but is not part of Guardiola’s plans. He made 15 Premier League
  appearances last season, scoring three times, but the academy graduate has
  never been at regular at the Etihad Stadium. McAtee had interest from
  Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, but was eager to stay in England.
  Forest are also keen to add a striker, full-back and central midfielder.
  Regarding midfielders they maintain interest in Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa
  and Milan’s Yunus Musah, and Liverpool’s Kostas Tsimikas is a potential
  defensive reinforcement. Savinho could also be heading for a City exit after
  Tottenham registered an interest in the winger. Preliminary talks have been
  held over the 21-year-old, who joined City from Girona last summer. It is
  expected to take at least £50m for City to consider selling the Brazilian.
  Spurs are looking for attacking reinforcements after missing out on Nottingham
  Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White and losing James Maddison to a long-term knee
  injury. Any outgoings may be followed by City looking to strengthen their
  options in the final third. They are understood to be considering a hijack of
  Chelsea’s pursuit of RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Chelsea have held talks over
  the Netherlands international, but have not made progress on a fee and want to
  sell players before lodging a bid. The deadlock may open the door for City to
  move for Simons, who has also been linked with Bayern Munich. Chelsea have
  agreed personal terms with the versatile 22-year-old, but the situation is
  complicated by their desire to find buyers for Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas
  Jackson and Tyrique George before making additions. Chelsea have plenty of
  depth and are determined not to panic after the England defender Levi Colwill
  sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury. They have options in central
  defence and will try to sign a new centre-back only if a suitable player comes
  on to the market.
