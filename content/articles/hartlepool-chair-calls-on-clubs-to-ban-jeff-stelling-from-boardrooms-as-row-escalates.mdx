  The broadcaster Jeff Stelling’s dispute with Hartlepool United has escalated
  with the chair, Raj Singh, writing to the other National League clubs asking
  them to ban the former Sky Sports presenter from their boardrooms. Stelling
  resigned in May as Hartlepool’s honorary president in protest at Singh’s
  handling of negotiations over the sale of the club, which Singh had put on the
  market more than two years earlier. Singh appears to have hit back by seeking
  to ensure that Stelling is denied hospitality at Hartlepool’s away matches,
  which begin at Yeovil on Saturday. “You may be aware from media coverage that
  Jeff Stelling has resigned as Honorary President of Hartlepool United Football
  Club,” Singh wrote in a letter sent last week. “As Chairman of Hartlepool
  United Football Club I would kindly and considerately ask that Mr Stelling is
  therefore not provided with official HUFC dignitary spaces in your board room,
  or equivalent, for any Hartlepool United fixture at your home ground. “In the
  unlikely event that Mr Stelling independently attends any Hartlepool United
  fixture at your home ground, I’d further request that you consider to seat Mr
  Stelling separately to any HUFC dignitaries or staff.” Stelling resigned after
  it became clear that a consortium’s proposed takeover was not progressing. The
  group led by the local businesswoman Shirley Hammond is understood to have
  grown frustrated that talks have stalled. “I know this is only an honorary
  role, but it is the best way I felt I could protest against the treatment of
  the party trying to take control of the club,” Stelling said when he resigned.
  “Supporters have been left in an intolerable position with a perceived threat
  to the future of the club should they not support the current owner.” Singh
  has since proposed holding a vote among season-ticket holders over whether he
  should stay in charge, although that has yet to take place. Stelling is a
  lifelong Hartlepool fan who often used his position as host of Sky Sports’
  live scores and results programme, Soccer Saturday, which he presented for 29
  years until 2023, to promote the club. In 2016 he was appointed as the club’s
  honorary president in place of Peter Mandelson, who was MP for Hartlepool from
  1992 to 2004. Singh saved Hartlepool from liquidation when buying the then
  League Two club and investing £1.8m, but the club have struggled in recent
  seasons. The Teesside-based care-home owner put the club up for sale after
  their relegation from the Football League at the end of the 2022-23 season.
  Singh declined to comment, but a Hartlepool spokesperson said: “Since Mr
  Stelling no longer holds any position – honorary or otherwise – in the club,
  but has indicated his intention to attend away games, the club has informed
  other clubs in the league that he is not attending on behalf of Hartlepool
  United Football Club.” Stelling declined to comment.
