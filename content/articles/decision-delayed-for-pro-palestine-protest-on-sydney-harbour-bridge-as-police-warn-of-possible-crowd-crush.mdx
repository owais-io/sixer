  Pro-Palestine protesters will have to wait until Saturday to find out if they
  can legally march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend, but
  organisers are vowing to go ahead regardless of the court decision. However,
  the court heard the protest organisers are willing to postpone the march if
  police agree to work with them. The Palestine Action Group faced the New South
  Wales police in the supreme court on Friday after the police rejected an
  application to facilitate the protest. “The most important point that I’m
  going to make to the court in these proceedings is that this application is
  not about whether the protest is occurring or not,” the group’s barrister,
  Felicity Graham, told the court, which will hand down its decision at 10am on
  Saturday. “I have the firmest of instructions that Palestine Action Group are
  proceeding with this protest … it cannot be stopped.” Graham said her argument
  was not to threaten the court, but to point out “the police have no choice”
  and there was no evidence prohibiting the protest would increase public
  safety. “The intention to march, irrespective of an immunity, is grounded in a
  belief that the situation is one of profound moral urgency and that the time
  is now,” she said. If the court sides with police and protesters proceed with
  a so-called “unauthorised” march, the police can exercise the full suite of
  their move-on powers. If the court authorises it, attendees will have immunity
  from being charged under the Summary Offences Act. Outside the court, prior to
  the hearing, a spokesperson for the group, Josh Lees, told reporters the offer
  still stood to delay the protest by up to three weeks if the police were
  willing to work with them. The court heard around 50,000 people were expected
  to attend – the same number estimated to have marched across the bridge for
  WorldPride in 2023. The police’s barrister Lachlan Gyles argued that what was
  being asked was “unprecedented” in terms of the “risk, the lack of time to
  prepare, and, of course, the location, which is one of the main arteries in
  one of the largest cities in the world”. He said there was not enough time to
  prepare a traffic management plan, and also warned of the potential for a
  crowd crush. “There’s been no liaison whatsoever with any of the agencies and
  government authorities who would be involved, most particularly Transport for
  New South Wales,” he said. He also said the court should be concerned about
  being seen to “condone” certain behaviours if there were “violent scenes” as
  the court heard of plans for a counter-protest near the bridge’s tunnel. A
  Christian-led group called Never Again is Now said they had lodged an
  application with NSW police to hold a rally on Sunday outside the Sydney
  Harbour tunnel. The protest was designed to draw attention to hostages still
  unaccounted for after Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The acting
  assistant police commissioner Adam Johnson, who gave evidence, was asked by
  Graham what police would do if tens of thousands of people turned up on
  Sunday. Johnson responded: “We would do our best in the circumstances to
  maintain public safety to the general public and to the people attending that
  location as well, and it would be difficult in either case.” Lees, who became
  emotional at one point while giving his evidence, told the court the only
  thing he saw stopping starvation and “genocide” in Gaza was “people power”.
  “We are not here to seek confrontation with police … we want to work with them
  to make this [a] successful event,” he said. The hearing came after several
  NSW Labor MPs defied their premier, Chris Minns, by vowing to attend the
  march. Labor’s Stephen Lawrence, Anthony D’Adam, Lynda Voltz, Cameron Murphy
  and Sarah Kaine were among 15 NSW politicians who signed an open letter on
  Thursday evening calling on the government to facilitate “a safe and orderly
  event” on Sunday. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Lawrence said the state’s
  “slow and steady demonisation of protest” risked repeating the events which
  led to Sydney’s first Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras march in 1978 being met with
  police violence. In a statement posted on Facebook on Friday, Lawrence
  criticised “the passage of laws that allow police to be used to end protests
  the government doesn’t like”. “We have seen in these respects one long,
  unprincipled capitulation to reactionary politics and it is dangerous,” the
  Labor MLC said. “I am a member of the Labor party, not the Liberal party. Our
  party is founded on protest and collective action. Attending is my way of
  sending a message that, in my view, we need to change course.” Lawrence said
  while the circumstances of the protest were “not ideal”, the event had become
  “absolutely inevitable”, which he said was “largely because of the way it has
  been mishandled”. He said he wanted to attend Sunday’s march to express his
  “utter revulsion” at Israel’s actions – which he said other countries,
  including Australia, had provided cover for. The other NSW parliamentarians
  who signed the letter calling on the government to allow the march over the
  Harbour Bridge were independents Alex Greenwich and Jacqui Scruby and the
  Greens’ Jenny Leong, Tamara Smith, Kobi Shetty, Sue Higginson, Cate Faehrmann,
  Abigail Boyd and Amanda Cohn. Libertarian John Ruddick was also on the list.
  Greenwich, the state MP for Sydney, said he shared the “widespread community
  horror” over what was happening in Gaza and said marching across the bridge
  would send a powerful message of solidarity. “Having successfully lobbied the
  previous Coalition government to allow a march across the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge in support of LGBTQ equality during Sydney WorldPride, I know it can be
  done,” he said in a statement. The premier on Friday morning said he expected
  “everybody in NSW to respect the outcome of the court’s decision”. “I
  acknowledge there’s a lot of people in Sydney, in NSW, that want to be part of
  a protest,” Minns told reporters. “They’re very concerned about what’s
  happening in Gaza to Palestinians and they want to be heard.” Minns said
  people who were planning to participate in the protest would still have “every
  opportunity to be heard”, even with an alternative route. Earlier in the week,
  he suggested a march over the bridge would cause the city to “descend into
  chaos”.
