  When the first pair of beavers to be legally released in England crawled
  sleepily from their crates into the ponds of Purbeck Heath in Dorset, it
  seemed like a watershed moment for wildlife in the UK. Wildlife charities
  rejoiced as ministers finally agreed for the nature-boosting rodents to be
  released, subject to licence, into the wild. Nature-friendly farmers kept an
  eager eye out for the application forms, hoping they could host the
  fascinating creatures on their land. But nature experts say the scheme has
  stalled, with not a single licence granted since those beavers were let loose
  on the National Trust reserve in March. The Guardian understands 40
  expressions of interest have been sent to the government since then, 20 of
  which are from the Wildlife Trusts, but none have yet been granted a release
  licence. Farmers who have tried to get a licence have found the application
  process flummoxing, saying some require 100,000 words – longer than some PhDs
  – and that it requires specialist ecological knowledge that many of them do
  not have. Stephen Bailey, a farmer near Sandleheath in west Hampshire, said
  his farm, which features a chalk stream, water meadows and copious willow,
  which the rodents eat, was “a perfect place for beavers”. He therefore applied
  to release some. Bailey said: “As soon as I heard that wild beaver releases
  were going to be allowed, I applied for an expression of interest form. And
  the amount of stuff I had to read, I filled out the form the best I could, did
  my best, but of course Natural England just came back and said no.” He said
  Natural England told him he could reapply if he would accommodate the entire
  Hampshire beaver release project, as no one else on the catchment had applied
  to release them. Bailey explained: “They said ‘you’re the only person on the
  Hampshire catchment who has applied to do the Hampshire and we need someone
  who will accommodate the whole thing.’ So I reapplied myself to do the whole
  lot. And [said] if there are any farmers who objected, they could come and see
  me. And I submitted it, but I haven’t heard back.” Nature groups have been
  campaigning for the return of beavers into the wild. They are often referred
  to as “ecosystem engineers”. They make changes to their habitats, such as
  coppicing trees, damming smaller watercourses, and digging “beaver canal”
  systems. These activities create diverse and dynamic wetlands that can bring
  enormous benefits to other species, such as otters, water shrews, water voles,
  birds, invertebrates and breeding fish, as well as sequestering carbon. They
  can also help farmers as the pools they dig hold water on the land, and keep
  the soil damper and more resilient to droughts. The Wildlife Trusts have also
  struggled to get beavers released on their reserves, despite their specialist
  knowledge. Craig Bennett, the CEO of the charity, said: “There is of course, a
  frustration, not least among the Wildlife Trusts, that sometimes doing these
  applications involves writing the equivalent of a PhD. I mean, literally, some
  of these applications are 90,000 to 100,000 words. It’s quite extraordinary.
  “It’s funny, isn’t it, how there are some parts of political spectrum that go
  on all the time about deregulation of environmental protections we need to
  keep and yet, actually, sometimes we have extraordinary regulations that are
  put on us on the business of nature recovery at times, and hold us back on
  nature recovery. We need to look at that. People are really excited about the
  return of this native animal to Britain, but what it does highlight in this
  whole discussion is actually what we need to do in Britain is not just learn
  to live with beavers. Actually, we need to learn again how to coexist with
  wildlife again.” Angelika Von Heimendahl, the beaver reintroduction manager
  for the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The Wildlife Trusts, and also the National
  Trust, we have quite a lot of really trained, experienced people. I think
  we’ve submitted very good expressions of interest, and I think there has to be
  a meaningful move from the government to release numbers of beavers into areas
  that are well researched, have had stakeholder involvement and not just a
  pittance. “We also don’t want to spend all our time and money jumping through
  hoops. We want to spend our money on the beavers, on the farming, on the
  learning about them.” A Natural England spokesperson said: “Reintroducing
  beavers to our landscapes is a significant milestone, and we are committed to
  considering any expression of interest and supporting full applications. It is
  important that species reintroductions are conducted carefully, to secure
  long-term environmental benefits while avoiding potential risks.”
