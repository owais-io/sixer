  The Trump administration’s attack on Lisa Cook’s future at the Fed was led by
  Bill Pulte, a Trump-appointed official leading the US Federal Housing Finance
  Agency, who alleged she had claimed two different properties were her primary
  residences when obtaining mortgages in 2021. “How can this woman be in charge
  of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?”
  Pulte wrote on X, formerly Twitter. He referred the case to the Department of
  Justice for investigation. Trump seized on the claims before Cook had
  responded, writing on Wednesday on Truth Social, his social network, that she
  “must resign, now!!!”. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, criticised
  Trump’s move against Cook. “Donald Trump is playing a dangerous game of Jenga
  with a key pillar of our economy,” he said. “This brazen power grab must be
  stopped by the courts before Trump does permanent damage to national, state
  and local economies. And if the economy comes crashing down, if families lose
  their savings and Main Street pays the price, Donald Trump will own every
  ounce of the wreckage and devastation families feel.” Hello and welcome to the
  US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the
  latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that Donald
  Trump has been accused of “cobbling together” allegations to fire Federal
  Reserve governor, Lisa Cook. The president said she would lose her job over
  allegations she committed mortgage fraud - an extraordinary move that marks
  the latest escalation in Trump’s attack on the central bank’s independence.
  Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her that he was removing her from her
  position “effective immediately”, based on the allegation from one of his
  allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she incorrectly
  described as her primary residence. Top Democrat on the US House of
  Representatives committee on financial services Maxine Waters said Trump’s
  attack on Cook was a clear continuation of his ongoing effort to “undermine
  the independence of the Federal Reserve” and deflect attention to signs of
  economic challenges caused by his policies. Waters said: Their latest target
  is Dr Lisa Cook, a highly qualified, trailblazing economist, and the first
  Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors since
  Congress created it in 1913. Let me be very clear, the allegations against Dr
  Cook have been cobbled together as a pretext to try to replace her with
  someone who will be loyal first to Trump instead of the US Constitution or US
  law. Cook responded several hours later in a statement emailed to reporters
  through the law office of the lawyer Abbe Lowell, saying of Trump that “no
  cause exists under the law, and he has no authority” to remove her from the
  job to which she was appointed by Joe Biden in 2022. She said: I will continue
  to carry out my duties to help the American economy. Lowell said Trump’s
  “demands lacked any proper process, basis or legal authority”, adding: We will
  take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.
  Trump posted the full text of the letter on social media on Monday night. In
  it, he said that he found “sufficient cause” in the allegation against her to
  remove her from her position. Meanwhile, top Democratic lawmakers furiously
  denounced Trump’s attempt to fire Cook. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts
  senator and ranking member on the Senate banking, housing, and urban affairs
  committee, called it “the latest example of a desperate president searching
  for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans”.
  “It’s an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve
  Act, and must be overturned in court,” Warren said. Read our full report here:
  In other developments: Unprompted, Trump said three times that he plans to
  rebrand the “Department of Defense” by returning to the pre-1947 name, the
  “Department of War”. In a court filing, the Trump administration said that it
  intends to withdraw federal approval for an offshore wind farm off the coasts
  of Maryland and Delaware. A large bruise on the back on Trump’s right hand,
  which the president appeared to be hiding, poorly, under a daub of makeup last
  week, was clearly visible during public appearances, renewing speculation that
  the White House might be concealing information about his health. California
  Republicans went to court to challenge a plan devised by the state’s governor,
  Gavin Newsom, to redraw congressional boundaries in response to a
  redistricting plan that aims to give Republicans in Texas five more US House
  seats. Video recorded for a Fox News streaming documentary about Trump proves
  that the president lied when he told reporters that Maryland’s governor, Wes
  Moore, had hugged and praised him at the Army-Navy football game in December.
  The Utah legislature will need to rapidly redraw the state’s congressional
  boundaries after a judge ruled Monday that the Republican-controlled body drew
  them in violation of voters’ rights.
