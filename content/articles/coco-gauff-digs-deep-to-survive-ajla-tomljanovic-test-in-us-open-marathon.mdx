  Coco Gauff survived a shaky serving performance to battle past Ajla
  Tomljanović in the first round of the US Open, winning 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 after
  2hr 57min on Tuesday night. The No 3 seed finished with 10 double faults, was
  broken six times and squandered a string of opportunities to close the contest
  earlier, but conjured enough resilience to scrape into round two under the
  lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Gauff appeared in control after winning five of
  six games from a break down to take the opener and twice leading by a break in
  the second. Yet she faltered when serving for the match at 5-4 in the third,
  conceding two double faults and a pair of forehand errors as Tomljanović
  levelled at 5-5. The 21-year-old American responded instantly, breaking back
  before sealing victory at her second attempt with a crisp backhand winner down
  the line, lifting her arms to the crowd in relief as much as celebration. “It
  wasn’t the best, but I’m happy to get through,” Gauff said. “I had so many
  chances. I just kept telling myself eventually one of them would go my way.”
  Her serve remains a clear work in progress despite recent changes to her team,
  including the addition of biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan. Gauff
  admitted the past week of practice had been punishing: “I was spending a lot
  of time on court literally serving until my shoulder was hurting,” she said.
  “It’s like learning a new language … I know this is the part of my game that
  needs to improve if I want to get the results I want.” The tension was evident
  in the deciding set. “That game where I served at 5-4 was definitely like an
  old habit,” she said. “The next game was a lot better. At 6-5 I told myself,
  trust the work we did on court.” Tomljanović, ranked 79th, had her chances
  too. The Australian committed 56 unforced errors and eight service breaks of
  her own, her heavy forehand threatening at times but ultimately too erratic to
  deliver the upset. Gauff, who admitted she had reminded herself of
  Tomljanović’s career-best win over Serena Williams at Flushing Meadows, felt
  the contest was the perfect early-round test. “First round is more stressful
  than the final, in my experience,” she said. “I don’t think it could get any
  more stressful than this.” Gauff will face Croatia’s Donna Vekić in the second
  round as she continues her campaign in New York, with the prospect of
  leapfrogging Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek for the world No 1 ranking for
  the first time still within reach if she can string together a deep run.
