  Fireworks explode, lasers shoot, giant balls bounce and a sea of LED
  wristbands pulse in synchronicity as a rugby stadium in Hull is turned into an
  exploding candy shop of colour. Now in its third year and approaching a final
  10 nights at Wembley Stadium – though it’s expected to return from 2027 –
  Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour is now the highest attended in rock
  history with more than 12m tickets sold. It’s easy to see why. Over the
  Springsteen-esque shimmer of Higher Power, Chris Martin and co offer up a
  dizzying dose of Technicolor funk-pop with a level of production that is as
  impressive as it is overwhelming. At times it’s like being plugged into a VR
  version of a “good vibes only” LSD trip, including sections with the band
  dressed as cute aliens and the audience wearing 3D glasses that turn
  everything into lovehearts. There’s no kiss-cam drama tonight and Martin is in
  effusive form, gushing praise for Hull and the crowd to almost sycophantic
  levels. It’s arguably futile to criticise the cloying earnestness and
  heavy-handed sentiment of Coldplay, given how baked into their DNA and appeal
  it is by now, but it’s laid on so thick it can feel exhausting. However, it is
  lapped up thirstily. When Martin tells the audience to “dance like nobody’s
  watching” over the EDM stomp of A Sky Full of Stars, to wave at someone in the
  crowd as if they are “a best friend you’ve not met yet” during the eruptive
  surge of Yellow, or to send positivity to the people of Sudan through wiggling
  their fingers as pyrotechnics pop, they do just that. Fix You is turned into
  an almost candlelit mass-type singalong as the audience’s wristbands turn into
  a warm yellow glow, and from a pounding version of Clocks to the gentle
  acoustic hum of Sparks, the band command, control and own every inch of the
  vast space as they move around it. An attempt at a karaoke-style singalong
  with the crowd to All My Love as a finale falls flat but it matters little.
  Fireworks are soon exploding again, bookending an evening that is pure visual
  extravaganza and intoxicating spectacle – like a rush of sugar to the head.
