  SoftBank has agreed to invest $2bn (£1.5bn) in Intel, amid reports that Donald
  Trump’s administration is also considering a stake in the struggling US chip
  maker. The Japanese technology investor announced the multibillion-dollar deal
  on Tuesday, in a move expected to give it a 2% stake in the business.
  Masayoshi Son, the chief executive and chair of SoftBank, described Intel as a
  “trusted leader in innovation”. “This strategic investment reflects our belief
  that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in
  the US, with Intel playing a critical role,” he said. Shares in the chip
  maker, which is listed in New York, rose by more than 5% in after-hours
  trading, while shares in the Tokyo-listed SoftBank dropped by about 4%. Intel
  is valued at more than $100bn. The US government is reportedly also
  considering taking a stake in Intel. It could be as high as 10%, according to
  Bloomberg. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Lip-Bu
  Tan, an industry veteran who took the top job at Intel four months ago, has
  been tasked with a huge turnaround project at the business. The company has
  suffered from slow sales and continued losses as it has struggled to maintain
  its technological edge in recent years. On Tuesday, Tan said Intel was “very
  pleased to deepen our relationship with SoftBank, a company that’s at the
  forefront of so many areas of emerging technology and innovation and shares
  our commitment to advancing US technology and manufacturing leadership”. He
  had “worked closely together [with Son] for decades”, he added. Donald Trump
  initially called for Tan’s resignation, accusing him of having ties to the
  Chinese Communist party. However, after meeting Tan in Washington last week,
  the president praised the Intel boss, saying he had “an amazing story”. If the
  US government takes a 10% stake in the business, it could surpass the asset
  manager Vanguard as the chip makers’s single biggest shareholder. It would
  mark the Trump’s administration latest attempt to intervene in an area of the
  private sector that it considers nationally strategic. Trump has threatened
  previously to impose tariffs of up to 100% on imported semiconductors and
  chips, which could favour Intel as a US-based semiconductor business. Earlier
  this month, the US government announced a deal that would result in chip
  makers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices paying 15% of their revenue
  from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government. In July, the defence
  department also announced it would take a $400m preferred stake in the US
  rare-earth producer MP Materials. For SoftBank, the Intel investment expands
  its presence in the US, while the Japanese government pushes Trump to cut
  tariffs in exchange for investment in the American economy. The Japanese
  company committed to increasing its presence in the US last year, and Trump
  announced in December that SoftBank would pour $100bn into the US economy over
  the next four years. Danni Hewson, an analyst at the investment broker AJ
  Bell, said SoftBank’s investment provided “one vote of confidence that Tan’s
  recovery effort can be successful. “Intel has been left behind by the shift to
  AI with US peers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices enjoying much greater
  success in this market,” she said. “The company’s position as the last US
  manufacturer of high-end semiconductors of any scale means it has potential
  strategic significance across the Atlantic but translating this into improved
  operational and financial performance is now the big challenge.”
