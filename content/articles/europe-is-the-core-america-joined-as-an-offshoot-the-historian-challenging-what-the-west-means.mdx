  For your book The West: The History of an Idea, you spent 12 years researching
  what people mean when they talk about “the west”. At a time when America’s
  president shows more admiration for autocratic Russia than for Nato-allied
  countries in Europe, are we witnessing the end of the west as an idea? I
  certainly wouldn’t write off the west. What we are seeing is a challenge to a
  version of the west that had America as its leader. But it doesn’t have to
  signal the end. The west is crucial to Europeans, and they have been the core
  of it. America joined at some point as an offshoot; it has been isolationist
  before, and it may become isolationist again. So we may see a different
  version of the west for a while, with its core in Europe, as it historically
  has mostly been. But America will surely return sooner or later. A west
  without America is hard to get one’s head around. When we use that term, most
  people think of the cold war, and a western alliance led by the Anglosphere …
  Of course. One common view is that the notion of the west gains traction with
  the foundation of Nato in 1949 and the cold war. At the other extreme there’s
  the “from Plato to Nato” idea, which says the west started with ancient Greeks
  when they fought off the Persians. Meanwhile, among historians, there has been
  a boringly universal consensus that the west as a self-conscious idea begins
  in the 1880s or 90s, and is due primarily to the needs of British imperialism:
  it was invented to justify imperialism, to demarcate the oriental east of Asia
  and Arab peoples as an “other”. But I disagree. In my research I found it was
  French writers who first started using the word in the 1820s, and they did so
  because they realised the term “Europe” was no longer fit for purpose. What
  was wrong with “Europe”? The problem was that geographically and politically,
  from the time of Peter the Great in the early 18th century, it included
  Russia. Later, Russia’s Tsar Alexander I came to dominate the 1815 Congress of
  Vienna and the Holy Alliance that he established subsequently. More and more
  western Europeans began to worry about Russia’s inevitable domination of
  Europe. It was a large and expansionist monolith. The 1820s saw the Greek war
  of independence against the Ottoman empire, but for a lot of French
  commentators the real danger was that Russia could take Constantinople after
  an Ottoman collapse they saw as imminent. They began to see the Greeks as a
  kind of rampart of the west. In the 1830s, talk of “the west” and a “western
  alliance” became more acute, because by then Alexander I had died and Nicholas
  II was very despotic. There was an anxiety that Russia was not on the margins
  anymore and could be about to dominate Europe. Crucially, France had become a
  constitutional monarchy as of 1830 with the July Revolution. Suddenly an
  Anglo-French “western” alliance of constitutional regimes made sense in a way
  it didn’t before with the absolutist Bourbons. And so more and more you had
  speeches by French members of parliament proposing une alliance européenne ou
  plutôt occidentale. Geographically, where did this original version of the
  west start and end? This is where Auguste Comte comes in, perhaps the most
  neglected philosopher of the modern world. These days he is mostly remembered
  for inspiring the motto “Ordem e Progresso” (Order and Progress) on the
  Brazilian flag, and for being cited in practically every novel by the
  controversial French novelist Michel Houellebecq. But in the 19th century,
  Comte’s philosophy of positivism was immensely influential, comparable in
  impact only to Hegel. And Comte endlessly banged on about the importance of
  speaking about the west and not Europe, and defined and analysed what he meant
  by “the west” in many voluminous writings and in great detail. Comte insisted
  the west needs to include what he called the five great nations, by which he
  meant linguistic groups: German (which for him included the Scandinavians and
  the Dutch), French, Italian, Iberian and English – plus the descendants of
  their settler colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. He tried to
  make “the west” as non-religious a unit as possible. It was not the same as
  “Christendom” – unlike more modern “western civilisation” advocates such as
  Samuel Huntington, Comte didn’t believe that your religion is your destiny. So
  he included Greece, in spite of its Orthodox religion and its being located on
  the edge of the Balkans, because of the importance of ancient Greek culture
  for Rome. And he didn’t want the west to be an ethnic unit either, so he also
  included Poland even though it was Slavic, because it had been Catholic for
  1,000 years. So from the beginning the west went with an open-ended vision of
  a membership not based on genetic or religious origins, and thus allowing the
  possibility of expansion or enlargement of membership. That does make it sound
  a bit like an imperial project, though… On the contrary. Comte’s vision was
  that the west would one day come to include the whole world – but never
  through the means of conquest. He insisted empires should be abolished:
  Algeria should be given independence, the English should leave India, and each
  large country should split into smaller republics so they could be better
  governed. Comte included both South and North America in the supranational
  unit he called the west, or République Occidentale. But America only signed up
  to the idea of the west belatedly, towards the end of the 19th century and
  more decisively during the first world war. Even then it did so reluctantly,
  mainly due to the influence of academics who had studied at German
  universities and German migrants. Americans in the early decades of their
  country’s existence had fair reasons to be sceptical, since the last thing
  they wanted, as the world’s first postcolonial nation, was to be associated in
  some cultural or political unit with the imperialist and semi-aristocratic
  Europeans. As the idea of the west has evolved over time, various states and
  regions have been added on or taken away. During the cold war, Japan was seen
  as part of the west – albeit mostly politically, militarily and
  technologically, and less so culturally. Westernisation and modernisation are
  not the same thing. Turkey was – and in a sense remains – part of the west
  because it is in Nato, even though Mr Erdoğan would hate to hear Turkey
  described as part of the west. The vision of the founder of the Turkish
  Republic, Kemal Atatürk, and of a major ideologist of Turkish nationalism,
  Ziya Gökalp, was for Turkey to join “western civilisation”. But currently
  Erdoğan seems to have different plans. Would Ukraine have fit into this
  original version, into the West 1.0? Ukraine’s situation in the 2020s is
  comparable to that of Greece in the 1820s, in that both countries’ cultures
  have been shaped by Orthodox Christianity. Religion is important, but people
  also make their own history. I challenge anybody to explain to me how you can
  tell the Ukrainians they are not western if they decide to be, and if they
  fight as hard as they do to prevent their conversion into a satellite of
  Russia. The way Europeans talk about Ukraine now is very similar to how French
  commentators spoke of Greece exactly 200 years ago. The Franco-Swiss writer
  Benjamin Constant wrote that Europeans had become used to their luxuries and
  their peace, and in Greece he saw a people willing to fight for freedom and to
  be the rampart of the west, as he explicitly put it in 1825. Thus Ukraine is
  an additional new member, as the west is once again being redefined. If the
  idea of the west is so malleable, are there any common denominators at all? If
  you are asking if there is a common denominator among the widely different
  definitions of what distinguishes the west from other cultures, I would say
  there is. Thinkers ranging from the Trotskyite anticapitalist Cornelius
  Castoriadis to conservative liberal Raymond Aron agreed that what
  distinguishes the west is its capacity for self-criticism and self-correction.
  In the course of history you have governments that do terrible things, but
  then you have regenerative and corrective movements that come as a reaction to
  previous injustices. It seems to be ingrained in the value system of the west
  to be self-critical. Most criticism of the west, such as anti-colonialism, has
  emerged from within its own value system. Some of the most fascinating
  criticisms of the policies of its governments, such as by the African American
  novelist Richard Wright, were asking the west to do the “western” thing, to
  live up to its principles more consistently. That sounds less like a value and
  more like a habit. You are right. It’s a predicament, a historical accident.
  The French Protestant historian François Guizot argued in the 1820s that the
  reason western Europe’s civilisation had not stagnated since the fall of the
  Roman Empire was conflict and plurality. It’s not that the Catholics didn’t
  want to abolish the Protestants, that the Germans didn’t want to abolish the
  French or the French didn’t want to abolish the Germans, the aristocrats, the
  democrats, and so on: it’s that nobody prevailed. So people learned to live
  with disagreement and conflict, and learned how to put up with each other. Not
  because they have any genetic or inherent superiority but just because they
  had to. I’m against the use of the term “western values”, because if you call
  something western you can’t hope for others to consider adopting it. Calling
  liberal democracy, constitutional guarantees, freedom of speech, freedom of
  sexual orientation, justice, equality of treatment, and so on, “western
  values” plays into the hands of Putin and every dictator. It is probably wiser
  to call such values by universal names if they are to have a chance to be
  attractive to people from other cultures. That a number of values,
  institutions and principles that many of us today cherish came to be combined
  in the west is a historical reality. But they do not need to be called
  “western values” because nobody has ownership of cultural productions. But I
  also think if we resign to abolishing the west, or allowing it to
  auto-destruct, many progressives will end up badly missing it. If we throw the
  baby out along with the bathwater, as Richard Wright put it in 1956, “the
  precious heritage – the freedom of speech, the secular state, the independent
  personality, the autonomy of science – which is not western or eastern, but
  human, will be snuffed out of the minds of men.”
