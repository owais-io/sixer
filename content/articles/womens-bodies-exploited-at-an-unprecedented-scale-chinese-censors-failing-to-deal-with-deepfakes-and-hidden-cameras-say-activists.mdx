  When Ming* found a hidden camera in her bedroom, she prayed for a reasonable
  explanation, wondering whether her boyfriend had placed it there to record
  memories of their “happy life” together. But hope quickly turned to horror.
  Ming’s boyfriend had been secretly taking sexually exploitative photos of not
  just Ming and her female friends, but also of other women in other locations,
  then using AI technology to generate pornographic images of them. After Ming
  confronted him, he “begged for mercy” but became angry when she refused to
  forgive him, Ming reportedly told Chinese news outlet Jimu News. Ming is just
  one of many women in China who have been covertly photographed or filmed –
  both in private and public spaces, including toilets – by voyeurs who have
  then circulated or sold the images online without consent. The sexually
  explicit pictures – often taken using pinhole cameras hidden in ordinary
  objects – are then shared online in massive groups. The scandal has left China
  reeling and raised questions about the government’s ability – and willingness
  – to crack down on such behaviour. One such group on Telegram, an encrypted
  messaging app, is named “MaskPark tree hole forum” and reportedly had more
  than 100,000 mostly male members. “The MaskPark incident exposes the extreme
  vulnerability of Chinese women in digital spaces,” Li Maizi, a prominent
  Chinese feminist now based in New York, told the Guardian. “What’s even more
  insidious and shocking is the prevalence of perpetrators known to the victims:
  partners, boyfriends, even fathers committing sexual violence against underage
  girls.” The scandal has sparked fury on Chinese social media and triggered
  discussions on the challenges of combating online harassment in the country.
  Although Chinese regulators have the power to clamp down on sexual harassment
  and abuse online, the system is currently focused on restricting the flow of
  information deemed politically sensitive, says Eric Liu, a former content
  moderator at the Chinese social platform Weibo who is now a US-based editor at
  China Digital Times. Since the scandal broke, Liu has seen “large-scale”
  censorship of the MaskPark incident on the Chinese internet, where posts seen
  as having a social impact – including feminist content – are often scrubbed by
  censors. “If the Chinese government wanted to shut down the groups, they
  definitely could,” Liu says, referring to previous cases of Chinese
  authorities infiltrating online spaces overseas. “The scale of [MaskPark] is
  massive. I can’t think of a similar incident of this scale in recent years.
  But Liu says he is not surprised. “There’s always been this type of content on
  the Chinese internet.” In China, those who are found guilty of distributing
  pornographic content can be sentenced to up to two years in prison, while
  people who take photos without the subject’s consent can be detained for up to
  10 days and fined. The country also has regulations protecting people against
  sexual harassment, domestic violence and cyber-abuse. But advocates say the
  current legal framework is insufficient. Often the burden falls on victims to
  gather evidence to build their cases, which can be difficult to do for crimes
  that take place online, according to Xirui*, a Chinese lawyer in Beijing who
  specialises in cases of gender-based harm. “The behaviour itself also needs to
  meet certain elements of the crime, such as a specified number of clicks and
  subjective motives,” Xirui says. “There’s also the problem of the statute of
  limitations, which is only six months for public security cases. Once that’s
  exceeded, the police will not file the case.” The Guardian contacted China’s
  ministry of foreign affairs for comment. Beyond the legal hurdles, victims of
  crimes of a sexual nature often grapple with shame, which prevents many from
  speaking out. “I’ve seen similar cases where landlords install cameras to spy
  on female tenants. This type of situation is generally treated as a privacy
  violation, subject to administrative detention, with victims seeking civil
  compensations,” Xirui says. To tackle the problem, the government could
  implement more specialised legislation, improve gender-based training of law
  enforcement officials and encourage courts to issue guidance that includes
  examples of relevant cases, the lawyer says. For Li, the recent incident
  reveals a widespread tolerance and lack of meaningful law enforcement on the
  issue in China. Rather than tackling the proliferation of sexist and abusive
  content online, authorities appear more focused on detaining female writers of
  homoerotic fiction and censoring victims of digital abuse, she says. “With the
  rise of deepfake technologies and rapid online circulation of surreptitiously
  filmed content, women’s bodies are being digitally exploited at an
  unprecedented scale,” Li says. “But I believe if authorities are truly
  willing, and invest the necessary resources, it’s entirely possible to trace
  and prosecute these crimes. We need to hold the Chinese government
  accountable.” * Names have been changed Additional research by Lillian Yang
