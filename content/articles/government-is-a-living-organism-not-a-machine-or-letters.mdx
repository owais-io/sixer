  Martin Kettle is right to call for leaders who can operate the machinery of
  government (Opinion, 7 August). However, it should be made clear that the
  machinery of government – in which I work as a senior civil servant – is not a
  “machine”, as many current leaders assume. In his 2024 book On Leadership,
  Tony Blair says leaders often make the mistake of believing that the machinery
  of government is “like an instrument in their hands” that they can learn how
  to use. It is not an instrument, he points out, but “a living organism [with]
  a mind and a temperament”. This common misunderstanding of the nature of the
  system underpins the government’s consistent inability to deliver. Anne Owers’
  independent prison capacity review is just the latest example. Machines can be
  mastered with manuals, precise plans and predictable cause-and-effect levers,
  but living organisms behave differently. As anyone who has raised a toddler or
  a teenager can attest: predictability and cause-and-effect do not apply.
  Linear approaches suitable for the “machine”, such as plans and targets, are
  ineffective, serving only to increase bureaucracy. Meanwhile, all remains
  quiet on the delivery front. Owers’ review evidences this, describing the
  prisons-capacity response as bureaucratic and repetitive, with too much
  discussion and too little action. Treating the machinery of government like a
  complex organism, rather than a machine, is the only way it will be
  effectively deployed. The UK government’s own guidance on “systems thinking
  for civil servants”, as well as research by the Institute for Government,
  acknowledges this, with the latter noting that the machinery of government
  cannot be “controlled through plans and ‘levers’”. Yet time and again, leaders
  fall back on the same familiar levers, expecting different results. They
  deploy tools suitable for the “machine”, including endless plans and
  committees. Bureaucracy begets bureaucracy, while delivery is missing in
  action. Breaking this cycle will remain unsuccessful for as long as leaders
  continue to treat government as a “machine”. Name and address supplied •
  Martin Kettle correctly identifies the stranglehold that Treasury orthodoxy
  has on government, but does not go far enough in identifying the source.
  Supply-side theory claims that growth comes when entrepreneurs are given
  incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies. Private businesses will employ
  people and the wealth they create, the taxes they pay, will allow government
  to improve public services. Forty years of failure has not dented faith in
  this flawed doctrine. Perhaps because those who administer the policies do not
  suffer the effects. Instead of giving money to rich businessmen, much of which
  finds its way into tax havens, why not try using it productively through
  existing channels? Public spending is not a dirty word. Creating a safe,
  healthy and prosperous society is the essence of government. Local
  authorities, especially in poor areas, are desperate for funds to keep their
  communities in a half-decent state: give them money to rebuild and repair,
  perhaps with encouragement to source locally. Bring in a local income tax
  instead of rates. Reverse the increase in employer’s national insurance
  contributions, which is a tax on jobs. When demand increases, supply will
  follow. In this way the economy will grow organically, sustainably and all
  around the country. Hazel Davies Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside • Have an
