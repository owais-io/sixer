  The Trump administration is suspending some research grants to the University
  of California, Los Angeles, claiming “antisemitism and bias”, the school
  announced in a statement on Thursday. “UCLA received a notice that the federal
  government, through its control of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the
  National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies, is suspending certain
  research funding to UCLA,” Julio Frenk, the university chancellor, said in a
  letter to the campus. The move means “life-saving research” will be defunded,
  he said. “It is a loss for Americans across the nation whose work, health, and
  future depend on the groundbreaking work we do.” Frenk did not say the value
  of the grants, but the Los Angeles Times reported that roughly 300 grants
  amounting to nearly $200m were suspended. The federal government has moved to
  pull billions of dollars from prominent universities across the US after
  accusing the institutions of failing to adequately respond to antisemitism
  during pro-Palestinian protests, and referred some to the Department of
  Justice. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has reached agreements with
  Brown University and Columbia University to restore funding and close
  investigations into the schools. The agreement with Brown requires the
  institution to commit to nondiscrimination in admissions and programs, and
  allow the administration access to admissions data. Meanwhile, Columbia’s
  controversial deal requires it pay more than $220m, expand its Institute for
  Israel and Jewish Studies, review Middle East curriculum and cut programs
  promoting “unlawful efforts” related to diversity. Harvard remains in a legal
  fight with the federal government over its move to freeze billions in federal
  funds. The news out of UCLA comes days after the school reached a nearly $6.5m
  settlement in a lawsuit by Jewish students and a professor who said the
  university allowed antisemitic discrimination to take place on campus during
  protests last year. Earlier this week, the Department of Justice notified the
  University of California that its investigation found that UCLA’s response to
  a protest encampment in spring 2024 was “deliberately indifferent to a hostile
  environment for Jewish and Israeli students” and that students experienced
  “severe [and] pervasive” harassment. In his statement about the grant
  cancellations, Frenk said the university had taken steps to combat
  antisemitism, and ensure the school is safe and welcoming for all, including
  the creation of a new Office of Campus and Community Safety and an Initiative
  to Combat Antisemitism. He also highlighted the university’s history of
  research, including planetary scientists who search for asteroids that could
  pose a threat to Earth, a Valley Fever Center and the role researchers played
  in helping create the internet. “This far-reaching penalty of defunding
  life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,”
  Frenk wrote.
