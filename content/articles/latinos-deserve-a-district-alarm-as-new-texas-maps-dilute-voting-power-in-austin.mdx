  ‘Latinos deserve a district’: alarm as new Texas maps dilute voting power in
  Austin

  When representative Greg Casar won his election in 2022, he became the first
  Latino to represent the Texas capital city of Austin in the US House of
  Representatives. A panel of federal judges had drawn his district’s lines
  after a prolonged legal battle over racial gerrymandering. But under the map
  Texas Republicans unveiled last week, Casar would instead live in the modified
  version of his neighboring district to the west, which would swallow east
  Austin – a gentrifying but historically working-class area home to Mexican
  American and Black residents once forced by segregation laws to live on the
  east side of town. “Even a conservative supreme court said central Texas
  Latinos deserve a district, and that’s why my district exists,” Casar said.
  “If Donald Trump is able to suppress Latino voters here in Austin, he’ll try
  to spread that plan across America.” Texas Republicans took the unusual step
  of redistricting several years early in an attempt to deliver more
  congressional seats to Donald Trump ahead of next year’s midterm elections.
  Democratic state lawmakers fled the state Sunday to try to thwart the GOP
  redistricting plan by denying state lawmakers a quorum needed to pass it into
  law. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said Monday he would seek to arrest and
  possibly unseat and replace Democratic lawmakers who do not return. In
  majority-minority Texas, where Black and brown voters have traditionally
  leaned left, the overtly political ploy is teeing up another in a series of
  legal battles over racial gerrymandering that have erupted repeatedly for more
  than a decade. The dramatic reshaping of Casar’s district 35 is one of the
  most egregious examples cited by civic groups concerned that the new map will
  dilute Latino voter strength and make it harder for candidates of color to win
  congressional elections. “The map as proposed clearly violates the Voting
  Rights Act and is unconstitutional,” said Lydia Camarillo, the president of
  the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. “It’s canceling out
  districts that are part of the Voting Rights Act … and it’s not giving Latinos
  the right to represent their voice based on their population growth.”
  Hispanics are the largest population segment in Texas, at about 40%. Only
  one-fifth of the state’s 38-member House delegation is Hispanic, however.
  Since the last census, civic groups like Camarillo’s have contended that the
  state’s booming Hispanic population growth merits two more Latino-majority
  congressional districts under the Voting Rights Act – one in Houston and the
  other in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. A dozen organizations and
  several individuals are pressing Texas to create the two Latino-majority
  districts in an ongoing federal lawsuit in El Paso. The new GOP-drawn map not
  only fails to provide those two Latino-majority districts, but it
  significantly dilutes the voting strength of the ones that exist, critics say.
  “This is a calculated move that exploits Texas’ historically low voter turnout
  for those in charge to maintain power,” Jackie Bastard, the executive director
  of the voter turnout group Jolt Action, wrote in an email. “By deliberately
  diluting Latino voting strength across districts, these maps would severely
  diminish the impact of our ongoing voter mobilization efforts and silence the
  voices of Texas’ fastest-growing demographic.” Those intricacies are often
  difficult to tease out. Congressional district nine, represented by Democratic
  representative Al Green, for example, is a so-called “coalition district”
  under the current map, with no one ethnic or racial group holding a solid
  majority. In practice, however, it functions more like a Black-opportunity
  district in a state where African American voters are becoming a smaller share
  of the electorate. Under the new map, district nine’s Black population
  plummets to 11%, while the Hispanic voting age population now holds a
  majority. But the historically low voter turnout rate there raises doubts that
  the district will actually function as a Latino-majority district, said Gloria
  Leal, the general counsel for the League of United Latin American Citizens,
  one of the plaintiffs in the El Paso case. Representative Sylvia Garcia’s
  district 29 also dropped enough to raise concerns, while retaining a majority
  on paper. Representative Henry Cuellar’s district 28, on the other hand, saw
  the opposite approach under the new map – Hispanics voters shot up to roughly
  90% of the voting age population. “They added like 20 percentage points to
  that district to pack us all in,” Leal said. “We oppose the current map that
  exists and we adamantly oppose the proposed map,” she added. Any redrawing of
  Texas districts is likely to draw the scrutiny of the federal courts, given
  the state’s long history of voter suppression. The Voting Rights Act, which
  will celebrate its 60th anniversary on Wednesday, prohibits both diluting a
  protected groups’ votes across multiple districts and packing voters into a
  single one. Carrying out such sweeping changes so quickly at the request of
  the White House may also raise legal questions that go beyond the Voting
  Rights Act, according to Thomas A Saenz, president and general counsel of the
  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing the
  plaintiffs in the El Paso case. “This is clearly improper,” Saenz said.
  “Trying to circumvent judicial review by acting so close to an election is
  straight-up unlawful.” Political analysts had widely viewed Republicans’ goal
  of finding five congressional seats for Trump as an overly ambitious one that
  may backfire. The map that Republicans came up with in 2021 to fortify their
  current lopsided majority in the congressional delegation appeared hard to
  alter without making the party more vulnerable to Democratic challenges. Texas
  conservatives appear to have exceeded those expectations, according to Rice
  University political scientist Mark Jones – partly by “riding roughshod” over
  the Voting Rights Act. “I underestimated the level of disregard of the Voting
  Rights Act,” Jones said. “It’s not clear how the Voting Rights Act constrained
  this map in any significant way, with the exception that Republicans focused
  on hitting absolute majorities of Hispanics in a few districts.” Still, Jones
  said, Republicans drew the map with an exceptionally favorable year in mind.
  If Republicans fail to consolidate the inroads they made in last year’s
  election, which is normal during a midterm, the new map could easily fail to
  produce a single new GOP congressional seat in Texas. It might even lead
  Republicans to lose a seat, according to Jones. “One thing that is very clear
  about this whole process is these maps are being drawn under a very rosy
  scenario,” Jones said. “And with Trump not on the ballot, with the natural
  referendum on his presidency, an economy that may be problematic – it’s tough
  to imagine Republicans hitting 2024 numbers in 2026.” • This article was
  amended on 6 August 2025. Greg Casar is the first Latino to represent Austin
  in the US House of Representatives, not the US Congress as an earlier version
  stated. Ted Cruz has represented the whole of Texas, including Austin, in the
  US Senate since 2013. Additionally, the state’s House delegation, not its
  congressional delegation as an earlier version stated, comprises 38 members.
