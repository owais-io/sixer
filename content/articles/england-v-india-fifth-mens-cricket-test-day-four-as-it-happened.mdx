  Ali Martin’s first hit is in, so I’ll wrap it up there. Thanks for joining me
  – shame we couldn’t see it through till the end. Here’s to a dramatic morning.
  Here’s what Joe Root had to say about Graham Thorpe after his tribute to the
  England great: he took out a headband and wore it to celebrate reaching three
  figures. Root told the BBC: He is someone that has impacted the game in this
  country as player, as a coach, as a mentor, as a friend. That gesture wasn’t
  just from me, it was from our whole dressing room. It’s been great to see
  everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a
  real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people.
  Stuart Broad has entered the conversation. Tom Keil makes a valid point.
  Cricket really doesn’t do itself any favours sometimes. Surely, they should
  have done everything they could to get it dry in 30 minutes and then have an
  inspection at 6.30. If it’s still wet, call it off then. But to make that
  decision early, with the series on the line, a full house at the oval, and
  millions watching and listening, is seriously frustrating. I would imagine
  there will be a lot of very distracted people across offices and work places
  between 11-12 tomorrow! Richard Gibbs writes: Surprise to see you say that
  England would be happy with the break...4 overs until the new ball. So India
  will start tomorrow with their bowlers rested. A great point, bringing Akash
  Deep firmly back into the game, too. My argument was that England just looked
  so frazzled out there, with every ball bringing danger. They needed something
  to take the sting out. To rub things in, the Oval looks glorious at the
  moment, sun beaming down, fans still getting their Instagram pics in before
  security boots them out. Our very own Philip Cornwall has got himself in
  trouble. Hi from Madagascar, Taha. Last Sunday the sporting gods shone on me,
  and gave me a one-hour delay on the flight here, so I could follow the
  Lionesses’ extra time and penalties in the queue for the flight here. Now the
  payback: I will be on the plane back from 6.10am BST until 3.50pm BST and will
  have no idea how the cricket ends till then. Could be the longest flight of my
  life. James Walsh writes in: F, and, I can’t emphasise this enough, F S. How
  are we supposed to handle this? Seems very appropriate though. Free entry
  tomorrow?! I’ve been informed that Surrey have sold out their day five
  tickets. A reminder then: England need 35 runs, India four wickets (including
  Chris Woakes in a sling). It’s pretty tough to call. England probably needed
  that break more than India, the two batters struggling to find the middle,
  with Siraj and Krishna thundering through on adrenaline. India’s supporters
  were on top, too. Before all of that, we had staggering tons from Harry Brook
  and Joe Root. But if England do lose from here, there will be plenty of focus
  on how the former got out, the bat flying out of his hand as he charged Akash
  Deep. That’s how the game works. Play has been abandoned. The series enters
  the fifth day of the fifth Test – and remains undecided. James Brough writes
  in: On the face of it, this looks like it should be easy from here. 150
  partnership. Less than a hundred to win. Wickets in hand. And yet. Woakes
  probably can’t bat. Stokes isn’t next man in. We’ve a pretty inexperienced
  lower order. And most of all, through this series, every time one team has
  been on top something has happened. India’s tail collapsed. The ball ran from
  a defensive shot on to the stumps. A catcher trod on the boundary rope. How
  ironic if, after all his efforts, the deciding moment is Siraj’s foot. Is
  there just one more twist to come? It might be a cliché, but I keep thinking
  of John Cleese’s line in Clockwise. “It’s not the despair. I can take the
  despair. It’s the hope.” It seems to have stopped raining. The question now is
  whether they can clean up in time. Nick Parish provides hope of play. It’s
  brightened up in the last couple of minutes. Thanks for the great commentary.
  The cricket reports are great but I am bewildered by your weather reports. I
  am about 5 miles south-west of the Oval and it continues to be warm and sunny.
  Keep the faith for more play tonight, and maybe even an England victory.
  Richard Morris writes in: My office is right next to The Oval - I can see the
  gas holders from the window. So ideally it’s going to rain for the next two
  hours, and then magically tomorrow morning there will be the greatest hour of
  play in the history of cricket available on my doorstep for a tenner. I may
  have to delay the all agency status meeting.... Another day five finish? Seems
  about right for this series. The rain has eased a little, with a drenched Lee
  Fortis surveying the arrangement of covers. It’s properly coming down now. I
  don’t think we’re playing any more cricket tonight. Prasidh Krishna has three
  for 109 off 22.2 overs. Mohammed Siraj has two for 95 off 26. They’ve given
  everything over the last half-hour, resuscitating India. Ian Sargeant
  deadpans: “This is really whetting my appetite for the Hundred. Can’t wait for
  that to start …” Tim Stafford writes: “It’s gonna be Woakes to hit the winning
  runs. You know it, I know it, the OBO knows it…” I can’t take the drama, Tim.
  It’s too much. Give me five, I need a chamomile tea. Chris Woakes is in his
  whites, with a sling on. Oh, and it’s raining. And India are appealing for a
  caught behind off Overton. WHAT IS GOING ON? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP TRACK
  OF ALL THIS? The umpire reviews to check for a bump ball; it’s hard to tell if
  Overton’s hit it, and the batter remains. Oh and now they’re checking the
  light. We’re going off. I’m going to throw my laptop at something. 76th over:
  England 339-6 (Smith 2, Overton 0) Smith is such a composed batter, but I’ve
  never seen him like this. He keeps swishing and missing outside off, Siraj in
  disbelief that he hasn’t found the edge. It’s a maiden. England need 35 to
  win. It’s seriously on-edge out there, but Oliver Pattenden has a seriously
  urgent question: “When was the last partnership between a pair of Jamies?”
  75th over: England 339-6 (Smith 2, Overton 0) Smith sends Overton back to
  avoid a run-out, England looking frazzled out there in the middle. Runs off
  the bat has become an impossible task … but Smith finally finds relief with a
  dig into the off side for one. Overton stops Krishna in his run-through twice,
  distracted by something in the background. They eventually finish the over,
  Overton still waiting for his first run. England need 35 to win. 74th over:
  England 338-6 (Smith 1, Overton 0) It’s another leg bye as Smith gets off
  strike, with Jamie Overton facing up for the first time. Siraj is alive again,
  rattling the top of Overton’s pad. The bat has disappeared from this game in
  the last few overs. An inside-edge follows … on to the pad. Overton hangs on.
  England need 36 to win. The Indian fans in the ground have raised the volume
  in the last couple of overs. Krishna angles the ball in and it’s another lbw
  shout against Root … the finger doesn’t go up and Gill decides to review.
  There’s no inside-edge … but the ball’s shown to be missing leg stump. The
  ball continues to rattle the pads as Smith collects a leg-bye. Root digs out a
  yorker as Siraj turns to the Indian supporters and applauds their work. And
  then the wicket. Wow. Root swishes his bat outside off and gets the edge,
  Jurel holding on. England need 37 to win. It looks far away now. 73rd over:
  England 337-6 (Smith 1, Overton 0) 72nd over: England 335-5 (Smith 1, Root
  105) Siraj launches into another leg-before shout before Root brings the home
  crowd some relief with a single. Smith gets plenty of applause for his first
  run, a punch to mid-on. Another leg-before shout follows against Root, though
  it looks a bit high. It’s a top over from the India quick. England need 39 to
  win. Chris Purcell sees darkness on the horizon. Oh no, the great collapse of
  ‘25. Still, it’s been a reasonably good summer. Sigh. 71st over: England 332-5
  (Smith 0, Root 104) Jamie Smith begins with an inside-edge on to his pads, and
  Krishna, tail up, ends the over by beating the bat, very nearly taking out off
  stump in the process. Oh this is good, very good. England need 42 to win.
  Jacob Bethell is having to battle here as Krishna gets the ball to leap past
  the outside edge. When Bethell gets ball on bat, he finds the fielder. And
  here comes the end: Bethell tries to break out of his funk by charging Krishna
  but his middle stump is uprooted via an edge. The tension is back. 70th over:
  England 331-4 (Bethell 5, Root 103) Siraj, with a slow, fairly exhausted walk
  back to his mark, launches again and again. He closes his over with the hands
  dropping to his knees. England need 43 to win. Peter Moss writes in after a
  googly exhibition: A mid afternoon check-in from a sunny Luxembourg park just
  in time for the Root ton, how lovely it is to see England whittling the target
  away. Was teaching my boys the wrong’un earlier (or my poor attempt at it)
  with a stage 3 tennis ball to the amusement of the locals. I think I may have
  pulled something I shouldn’t. Now time to lay on the picket blanket and check
  on the chaps bringing home the bacon. A welcome release for England as Deep
  sends it down the leg side and past the reach of Jurel, five wides the result.
  And then the clip to the leg side for two, giving Joe Root another hundred,
  his third in three Tests. That’s 39 in his career, taking him past Kumar
  Sangakkara in the all-time charts. He briefly dons a headband as a tribute to
  Graham Thorpe and points to the sky, a lovely nod to his old batting coach.
  Bethell then finds runs by threading the ball through point for four. England
  need 44 to win. 69th over: England 330-4 (Bethell 5, Root 102) 68th over:
  England 318-4 (Bethell 1, Root 99) Siraj skips in … and Root immediately dabs
  into the offside for one. He’s on to 99. Bethell, still trying to settle,
  hangs in there as Siraj goes around the wicket, hunting for stumps. The
  left-hander is on one after 22 deliveries. England need 56 to win. 67th over:
  England 317-4 (Bethell 1, Root 98) And we’re back, with Deep bowling to
  Bethell, who drives his second ball nicely … but straight to mid-on. The
  southpaw gets the opportunity to cut, but doesn’t beat the field. It’s a
  maiden. England need 57 to win. Tom Walling writes in: Greetings from
  sweltering Seville. 39° (and I had to pop out for more beer!) I had very
  little faith we’d get there, having been brought up on 90s England, but now
  we’re here, I have no doubt we’ll do it. Vagaries of time eh? Also, I may have
  drunk something. Thanks for everything, OBO people. Andy Hockley is pretty
  busy: I’m reporting in from the village of Foxton, where the home team, last
  year’s national village champions, are taking on Hambledon “the cradle of
  cricket” in this year’s semi final. A trip to Lords up for grabs today. Trying
  to watch both matches simultaneously is quite challenging (though the lads
  manning the bar have elected to focus on the test) I’m glad to report that the
  sun is out at the Oval, with the players starting to make their way out. Some
  Might Say is playing through the speakers. And now it’s hit me that the Test
  summer will be done in the next hour or two. Sad. It’s a slightly delayed
  restart, with a bit of a clean-up job ongoing after some light rain. We’ll be
  back on at 4.30pm BST. Zia Faruqi sends in a pretty decent one-liner: “Will
  Lee Fortis put an arm around Gambhir?” 66th over: England 317-4 (Bethell 1,
  Root 98) Siraj nips it back sharply into Root and is desperate for the
  leg-before … the finger does not go up. India review, primarily because of
  their situation, but impact is outside off stump. Root clips the next ball for
  two and then dabs the ball low, past the cordon, to the ropes – that’s
  immaculate batting. And then a straight drive for four more, just out of
  Siraj’s reach, taking Root to 98. He’s on for a ton before tea, but it’s a dot
  to finish the session. England need 57 to win. They really should do it from
  here. 65th over: England 307-4 (Bethell 1, Root 88) Nearly a chance. Bethell
  gets his pull shot all wrong, finding the bottom of the bat, the ball lobbing
  high into the air … but it gets over Deep, who can’t pull off the turnaround
  to take a stunner. Deep then beats the outside edge but Bethell resists. It’s
  a rare sight: a maiden. England need 67 to win. 64th over: England 307-4
  (Bethell 1, Root 88) Siraj, finding the last of his reserves, sends in the
  yorker to Bethell, how he got out in the first innings. The left-hander digs
  it out before clipping for one to get up and running. Root closes the over
  with a lush cover drive to the ropes. England need 67 to win. Some fair
  analysis here from Farhan … though it’s not done yet: I think a lot of us knew
  we were going to see yet another sequel of England’s chasing masterclass under
  Baz when India set them another target in the 370s. Indians are an I can
  attest will be sick and tired of starring in the same movie all over again.
  This may well be the most impressive of the three given the pitch is perhaps
  the toughest of the 3 chases, even though this time it does seem to be getting
  better for batting as the game goes on. Indians have bowled pretty well, but
  will lose the game and the series thanks to not having real answers to the
  brilliant English game plan and perhaps due to better familiarity with home
  conditions. It also did not help that India’s plan for a green grassy track
  involved 3 pacers and 2 spinners. 63rd over: England 301-4 (Bethell 0, Root
  83) Jacob Bethell, in his first home Test, makes his way out. Welcome to the
  circus, pal. England need 73 to win. Max Williams sent this in before that
  wicket … Weird parallels with the Oval test of the 2023 Ashes. Both sides make
  scores in the 200s with Australia holding a narrow lead. England then smash
  390 odd in the third innings. A big fourth wicket partnership takes Australia
  to 264-3 but ultimately they fall 49 runs short and draw the series 2-2. Deep
  floats up the juiciest of half-volleys and Brook wallops through the covers
  for four; Siraj, rolling on the carpet, looks absolutely cooked. Another
  boundary follows before the wildest of dismissals! Brook charges a length ball
  but miscues, his bat flying out of the hands to the leg side, the ball to
  Siraj at cover. Brook leaves with a standing ovation. Time for a twist? 62nd
  over: England 289-3 (Brook 103, Root 83) Siraj returns, reaching the end of
  his five-Test marathon. What a slog. There’s an issue with the footholes at
  the crease, so out comes a member of the ground staff to hammer away, allowing
  for a mid-over break. When play resumes, Root guides the ball behind point for
  four. The tension is being sucked out here. England need 81 to win. Dean
  Kinsella writes: My mate Tom reckons Shubman should offer to shake hands on
  this! David Howell sends this in: On the overall balance of play, England have
  no right to win this series 3-1... ..but picking three seamers on purpose, on
  a greentop, at the end of a draining series, is straight out of the Guinness
  Book of Sporting Blunders I remember reading and re-reading as a kid. I dread
  to think what apoplexy awaits from the Indian media if England do manage to
  complete the job of punishing that. Oh dear, Akash Deep has had a shocker
  there. Brook drives Sundar to deep extra cover and a tired Deep tries to boot
  it away with his left; it ricochets off his body and finds the rope. Brook
  then nabs two behind point, allowing him to celebrate his 10th Test hundred in
  his 30th match: a phenomenal record, a phenomenal player. This is up there
  with his best. 61st over: England 286-3 (Brook 101, Root 78) England need 88
  to win. 60th over: England 279-3 (Brook 94, Root 78) Jadeja switches ends and
  the crowd roars after a Root single, pleased by the number on the big screen:
  England need 100 to win. There’s another cheer when it goes down to 99. Is
  this how it’s going to be till the finish? Jadeja, uncharacteristically, slips
  out a full toss to close the over and Root dispatches it to the leg side for
  four. England need 95 to win. 59th over: England 273-3 (Brook 93, Root 73)
  There’s light rain in the air as Root hotfoots it to the striker’s end for a
  quick single off Washington Sundar. The singles keep on coming as the umpires
  converge … we’ll play on. England need 101 to win. 58th over: England 270-3
  (Brook 92, Root 71) Krishna finds a tasty line outside off stump to Root
  before providing some width; England’s No 4 gets his cut all wrong, failing to
  take advantage. Never mind, a gorgeous on-drive follows, bringing him two. An
  upper-cut is next, the single keeping Root on strike for the next over.
  England need 104 to win. Adam Roberts is loving it. Just gone 9 here in Cayman
  and I am glued to the tv and the OBO. My wife thought better of it than asking
  me to join her in a swim. Looks like Joe had a long chat with himself after
  the first innings and Krishna can chirp all he wants - Joe will keep his head
  down and score more runs 57th over: England 265-3 (Brook 92, Root 66) India
  need to find their voices in the field; the current noise is all Brook and
  Root, calling for their ones. They take three singles off Jadeja. England need
  109 to win. 56th over: England 261-3 (Brook 91, Root 64) Root mistimes a pull
  shot, the ball plopping close by on the offside; they still run through for a
  single. England need 112 to win. Brian Withington writes in: Am I alone in
  feeling that this series can’t possibly be complete unless and until a
  strapped up last man Chris Woakes comes out to face the second new ball one
  handed with two runs needed? 55th over: England 257-3 (Brook 89, Root 61)
  Jadeja goes a touch short and Brook pulls away to the deep midwicket rope for
  four, everything – hands, feet, mind – working so quickly to play that stroke.
  England need 117 to win. 54th over: England 251-3 (Brook 84, Root 60) Krishna
  is on from the Pavilion End, a short-ball field set. Brook tries the
  audacious, backing away to the leg side to try and swat through off … the ball
  is a touch high and eventually called a wide. A pull shot brings one before
  Root does the same two balls later. That’s 250 for England and the Oval crowd,
  very much entertained, show their love. England need 123 to win. 53rd over:
  England 246-3 (Brook 82, Root 58) Afternoon, lovely people. The floodlights
  are beaming down at the Oval, India returning to their positions after an
  important huddle at drinks. It’s Ravindra Jadeja who Shubman Gill turns to for
  the first time in the innings … and Root smashes the second ball down the
  ground for four. Harry Brook, probably itching to join in on the fun, stays
  calm to knock a single into the leg side. Root closes the over with one, too.
  Let’s get the countdown going, I reckon. England need 128 to win. 52nd over:
  England 239-3 (Root 52, Brook 81) Prasidh replaces Siraj and is clipped for
  two singles. That takes England to drinks with 135 more runs needed to pull
  off a famous run chase, the highest at the Oval. I’m off for slurp of
  something cold in the stands, thanks for your company, it’s been a riot. Taha
  Hashim is here to call the last rites of this memorable Test series. 51st
  over: England 237-3 (Root 51, Brook 80) Harry Brook unleashes a pull so
  blistering off Akash Deep that it can barely be seen by fielders or the crowd.
  Fair to say Brook saw it all the way. Gloomy at the Oval but England are
  feeling golden at the moment. 50th over: England 228-3 (Root 50, Brook 74) Joe
  Root goes to fifty with a pull for four off Siraj! A shy wave of the bat from
  Root, he knows there’s plenty left to do. Siraj bends his back and tries to
  get something going with short stuff but there’s nowt doing for India at the
  moment. 49th over: England 221-3 (Root 49, Brook 68) The Oval emits a deep
  purring sound as Harry Brook drives on the up and sends a ball from Akash Deep
  to the hoardings at deep point. Those hands are ridic. Root clips for four
  more and follows up with a compact drive for three, England collect twelve
  runs off the over. England fans - are you starting to believe? 48th over:
  England 209-3 (Root 42, Brook 63) Root runs another liquid single to backward
  point. Siraj gets some bite from a short ball that lifts and jags back onto
  Brook’s thigh pad. Don’t rub it, Don’t rub it*. “Henry Ford was an OBO guy”
  writes Alex McGillivray who is currently “rolling through the mean streets of
  suburban Detroit feeling as rough as Tarzan’s feet, looking for a breakfast
  joint after yesterday’s Dearborn Homecoming. Thank God for VPNs.” *Was that a
  Kings of Leon lyric? 47th over: England 208-3 (Root 41, Brook 63) The lights
  come on once more at the Oval with Akash Deep charging in. These aren’t the
  easiest batting conditions but Root and Brook have made batting look
  remarkably simple out there. Another hour of this and England could be home
  and hosed. You just know a wicket changes the whole complexion though. 46th
  over: England 206-3 (Root 40, Brook 62) England happy to tick over in singles
  and twos, the latter of which from Root brings up the 100 partnership and is
  met with a rousing cheer from the home support. 45th over: England 203-3 (Root
  38, Brook 61) Root and Brook scamper three singles off Siraj. Everyone in the
  ground well and truly lasered in on this chase now. 44th over: England 200-3
  (Root 37, Brook 59) The England fans in the crowd stand, applaud and cheer as
  a Brook single off Siraj brings up England’s 200. Richard Neal is getting his
  James Bond opening scene on. Bond was definitely an OBO guy. “Been driving
  through the French Alps down to the coast, currently passing Marseille.
  Deprived of other coverage, you’re a lifeline. Here’s hoping Harry is still
  hitting them huge when we get to Hyeres in an hour!” 43rd over: England 196-3
  (Root 36, Brook 57) Washington Sundar is summoned for a bowl from the Vauxhall
  End. He’s had a knack of picking up wickets in clumps in this series. How will
  Harry Brook treat the spin? He and Root both have a look, nudging singles from
  deep in the crease. Sundar then drops short and is BOSHED away off the back
  foot by Brook. Desmond Niall Mullen has got his teeth gritted. “Hey Jim, India
  might, like me in university, deserve a 2-2 but, as a wise man once said,
  deserve’s got nothin’ to do with it.” 42nd over: England 190-3 (Root 35, Brook
  52) India want to bowl at Joe Root and put the pressure on him but he’s such a
  class act that he picks off the singles and then skims a full ball from Siraj
  through midwicket for four. Like a pebble across plate glass. England go past
  the halfway mark in this chase and the Barmy Army are well aware. Cue some Bon
  Jovi parps from the trumpeter. 184 runs plays 6 (or 7…) wickets. 41st over:
  England 186-3 (Root 31, Brook 52) Brook brings up his fifty off just 38 balls
  to much acclaim in the crowd. He was on 19 when Siraj spilled him. “Sat at
  Waterloo station, recovering from my 12-hour stag-do in Soho last night.”
  Writes Jim Kerr. “Hopefully this next two hours is gonna stop me from sleeping
  all the way to Southampton Central.” 12 hours in Soho? Sending solidarity –
  more than enough to give you a simple mind this Sunday afternoon. Sorry, it’s
  been a loooong morning/series. 40th over: England 181-3 (Root 29, Brook 49)
  Siraj to start from the Pavilion End with a point to prove and a mistake to
  atone for. Joe Root oozes class as he glides Siraj down through the
  needlepoint for four with velvet soft hands. A solid defensive push into the
  covers elicits another single. 39th over: England 175-3 (Root 24, Brook 48) A
  single each to Brook and Root off Krishna before the more vociferous England
  supporters in the crowd give Siraj a decent serve as he dives onto the sponge
  to try and stop a Brook flick through midwicket in vain. Four runs. The lights
  are on at the Oval, feels very much like bowling conditions. Not that Harry
  Brook gives a fig, a meaty edge flies right through the gap in the slips and
  away for four more. Righto. Here come the players for the afternoon session.
  Buckle up knuckleheads. “Hello Jim ! On the one hand, I’ve been to eight T20
  games this summer, and seen three boundary catches where the fielder has
  calmly tossed the ball up, stepped over the boundary, stepped back in and
  completed the catch. It’s a practised routine now. On the other hand, on this
  ground in 2005, it was the bowler who had carried the visiting attack through
  five Tests who dropped that catch. Fatigue plays its part.” Don’t forget this
  one Tim Sanders, Boult had bowled New Zealand to the brim of the World Cup in
  2019. England got over the line that day but I wouldn’t put it past Mohammed
  Siraj to reduce his drop to a mere footnote and bend this game India’s way
  this afternoon with his skill and sheer force of character. A lunchtime wade
  into the OBO mailbag reveals a rapt audience from Helsinki to Hong Kong, Lake
  Bled, Belize and Brixton. Fan flipping tastic. How great that we are at lunch
  on day 24 of this series and it’s still in the balance. In a few hours we’ll
  know if it is 3-1 to England or a 2-2 draw that India more than deserve. BIG
  FIRST HOUR after lunch. England dine in Hell three down with 210 more runs to
  get. India need six more wickets (Hello Chris, can you hold a bat?… Chris?)
  What a morning of Test cricket that was, we hoped for a barnstorming finish to
  this series and it seems to be happening. England plundered 114 runs for the
  loss of two wickets in that session, something similar this afternoon and it
  will be game very much on. I’m off for a toke on some smelling salts. Back
  soon. 38th over: England 164-3 (Root 23, Brook 38) Here is the moment of the
  morning/series: 37th over: England 162-3 (Root 22, Brook 37) Brook steers a
  single past point and everyone just chills out a little bit as Joe Root comes
  on strike and plays out a calm four dots and an easy single off the last. Root
  is aloe vera to Brook’s screaming sunburn, the end of night kebab to Brook’s
  ten pints and hugging strangers on the night tube. Hold us, Joe. 36th over:
  England 160-3 (Root 21, Brook 36) Siraj’s sponge inflected catch keeps being
  shown on the big screen to loud cheers from the English. *In case you needed
  reminding, cricket is a cruel cruel sport*. Akash Deep slings five wides down
  the leg side which doesn’t help Shubman Gill’s conniptions. There are five
  minutes til lunch, I imagine England will just block it out. Cue manic
  laughter. 35th over: England 153-3 (Root 20, Brook 35) Ok. It’s all kicking
  off the Oval. Brook follows up his near miss with a flay over the covers for
  four and then ramps over the slips entirely deliberately for four more.
  Sixteen runs off the over. It doesn’t feel sustainable but by flip it’s good
  fun. Oh my oh my oh my! Harry Brook swivel pulls Prasidh Krishna but the shot
  doesn’t quite have the legs… the ball swirls and whirls in the grey South
  London sky before landing safely in Siraj’s hands at deep fine leg… BUT BUT
  BUT BUT in taking the catch he stumbles onto the rope! Shades of Trent Boult
  in the World Cup final, Siraj can’t believe it, the English crowd go doolally!
  Brook survives and gets a six to boot. I AM CALM! 34th over: England 137-3
  (Root 20, Brook 19) The lights come back on at the Oval but the gloam doesn’t
  mither Harry Brook – Deep drops short and is spanked through midwicket for
  four and then Brook follows with a charge down the wicket and a spank for SIX.
  England playing quietly for lunch then… the latter was some shot from Brook,
  one that has quickly become his trademark. Do not adust your set. 33rd over:
  England 126-3 (Root 20, Brook 8) Prasidh is too full to Root and it’s very
  much a case of don’t bowl there son as the great one pings him through cover
  for four. 32nd over: England 121-3 (Root 16, Brook 7) Deep replaces Siraj and
  stitches together a maiden, allowing me to scurry off and get a vat of Press
  office Kenco in the process. 31st over: England 121-3 (Root 16, Brook 7) Brook
  plays with hard hands at a length ball outside off and squirts an edge past
  the cordon for four. GET US A COLD ONE THEN ROSS?! Ah OK… a quote from Homer
  will have to do I suppose. Hi James, I’m keeping up to date from a little
  taverna on the shores of Syros in the Aegean. I’ve just ordered a second beer
  following Pope’s wicket, and am wondering is this a Herculean effort required
  now, or completely within Root and Brook’s arc? Hard to know with Bazball, but
  as Homer said (roughly): “Let us not die ingloriously and without struggle,
  but let us first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.”
  Having said that, I’m not sure there are any Homeric lines on the virtue of a
  draw after 6 weeks of battle?” 30th over: England 114-3 (Root 15, Brook 1)
  Siraj into his eighth over on the spin. He’s been the star bowler in this
  series and the only one that has stayed the distance - playing in every Test
  (with apologies to Chris Woakes). He’s incredibly skilful, getting the ball to
  talk on surfaces both dead and alive, all the while appearing like there’s
  nowhere else he’d rather be and giving it absolutely everything. Getting in
  the opposition’s face with a smile on his own. What a player. All flowers to
  him as they say these days. 29th over: England 113-3 (Root 14, Brook 1) Root
  unfurls a perfect cover drive off Krishna. “Talk nah Prasidh”. “If England
  could just imagine Ben Stokes is on the field, in their ears, cajoling,
  supporting, advising them, they’d be half way to an improbable victory.” He
  very much is looming over proceedings on the Oval balcony, Andrew Benton.
  England need something Stokesian now. You feel like this is the crucial
  partnership between Root and Brook. It could all be over quickly if one of
  them falls before lunch. 28th over: England 108-3 (Root 8, Brook 0) Siraj
  starts with a bouncer to Brook. ‘Arry needs a score here. He’s got 99 and a
  ton in the series but England need him to show his full talent, put his money
  where his mouth is and get a significant score. Just when you thought it was
  safe to go back in the water, Siraj scuds one in to Ollie Pope’s pad and the
  Surrey man has to go! It kept a little low and pranged him in front of leg
  stump. Pope knows it but takes a review with him. Oh, here comes Harry Brook.
  This’ll be nice and calm for everyone then. 27th over: England 101-2 (Pope 27,
  Root 3)Shot! A collective coo goes around the ground as Pope drives Krishna
  back down the ground for four and then clips sublimely off his pads for
  another boundary through midwicket. Fout more! A pull traces away across the
  baize and the sun comes out on cue! What was in the ginger ninja’s drink? I’ll
  have what he’s having. The Barmy Army trumpeter parps up with ‘Feeling hot hot
  hot’. Scenes. That’s the hundred up for England. 273 more to go. 26th over:
  England 87-2 (Pope 13, Root 3) Phew. A nerve jangling first hour comes to a
  close with a Mo Siraj maiden. The bowler is convinced Root got a tickle behind
  to a length ball that ducked in but Gill and Jadeja consult with Jurel and
  decide not to review. Wisely, DRS shows there was nowt doing. Time for a
  drink. Speaking of which… “Hi Jimbo Hopefully the sunshiiiiiiiiiiiiiine’s on
  England today otherwise this series could slide away which isn’t part of the
  Bazterplan. Yours biblically, a Wembley bound Gary and Pam Stableford.” 25th
  over: England 87-2 (Pope 13, Root 3) Root survives a HUGE appeal from Krishna
  and the cordon! A full ball that jagged back and hit him on the knee roll. An
  achingly long wait before the umpire shakes his head. India thought they had
  their man there. DRS shows it was clipping leg stump enough to be Umpires’s
  call but India didn’t send it upstairs. A heart in mouth maiden for both
  sides. 24th over: England 86-2 (Pope 13, Root 3) Knife edge stuff, it’s gone
  very gloomy and India can smell wickets in the murk. Root and Pope do well to
  weather an accurate over from Siraj, rotating strike for three singles. Thanks
  for all your emails – keep them coming in. “Hey, James. It’s Prakhar from
  India. I want to make a trade here. I don’t want Root to perform well today
  but I want him to have the ‘series of his life’ in a few months in Australia.
  Are you okay with this trade?” NO DEAL! 23rd over: England 83-2 (Pope 12, Root
  1) Joe Root is the new man. He sprints onto the Oval turf to a chorus of
  Rooooots. Reckon Krishna might have a little word in his ear? See if he can
  get a rise. You would, wouldn’t you? England need a Joseph Edward Root special
  right here, right now. Root… is off the mark first ball with a single clipped
  to leg. It’s gone a bit gloomy in South London. The lights have come on.
  England’s flame is flickering. GONE GONE GONE! Duckett flashes a drive at new
  bowler Prasidh Krishna and gets a meaty edge that is swallowed by KL Rahul in
  the cordon. India celebrate with tons of gusto, Gill haring across the
  outfield with hand raised like peak Alan Shearer. That’s a big wicket. 22nd
  over: England 82-1 (Duckett 54, Pope 12) Duckett goes to fifty with a
  fortunate edge wide of the cordon and away for four. He raises his bat
  somewhat sheepishly, aware there is plenty more to do. England’s target is
  hauled below three hundred. Roving/Rotter Reporter Jake Farrell flings his
  first missive from the Bedser lower stand here at the Oval. “Kuldeep Yadav is
  holding court. Almost prompted Beatles-esque fainting by offering an
  unprompted “Morning ladies” to a couple of punters. Now talking the ear off
  some kind of security guard in military garb. Very very #classy stuff. Has the
  air of a proud father of the bride at a wedding, taking it all in.” Dear Old
  Kuldeep would do a job today I reckon. Curly Charlie Chaplin Curtains
  bouncing, ball fizzing. Both teams have been guilty of some puddled selection.
  21st over: England 75-1 (Duckett 47, Pope 12) Duckett cuts Deep like Cat
  Stevens/Sheryl Crow depending on your age/preference. Two runs to the score.
  England whittling away. Deep sends down a bouncer that the wee man has a flap
  at and is lucky not to feather to Jurel. “Morning Jim. All four results
  possible but surely an Indian win is the most likely. Ollie Pope will need a
  few miracles today, not least his own batting, which is a meagre 18 in 4th
  innings. Like Steve Smith, but without the good first 3 before it. You hope
  his love for the Oval may help. You sense that him out early puts all the
  pressure on Root and Brook again. Lots of things will need to go right. I’m
  bricking it!” You and a few others too no doubt, Guy Hornsby. 20th over:
  England 72-1 (Duckett 44, Pope 12) Runs! Duckett clobbers a Siraj half volley
  through mid-off for four and then glances off his hips for a second boundary
  in the over. Each cheered wildly. Fair to say England’s fans at the side of me
  Believe like Cher in ‘97. In other news, get yourself a wife who texts you
  like Mark Funnell’s: Hi James, camping on the north Cornish coast with my son,
  I didn’t have any signal for much of yesterday on Porthcothan beach. When we
  got back to campsite, I recoiled with horror at India’s score. After seeing
  England’s blistering start, I dropped my wife a text to check whether she was
  watching. She WhatsApp video’d me to show me what was happening in the game -
  in real time. The very next ball Siraj bowled that searing Yorker to clean
  Crawley up. I felt a little sick. She laughed. It was like SHE KNEW IT WAS
  GOING TO HAPPEN.” 19th over: England 61-1 (Duckett 39, Pope 6) Pope and
  Duckett steal a couple of singles into the covers. To rollocking applause.
  “The first day of cricket I’m away from the TV and its turned out to be the
  most important of them. You must summon the spirit of all OBOers past and
  present to deliver the most vivid OBO to grace my eyes - something you’re well
  able for I’ve no doubt.” I’m not sure about that Rowan Tewari… but Taha is on
  later on. “On a more serious note, what a truly incredible series we’ve seen.
  For all those watching, this is the last day to truly sit down with your mates
  and savour every drive, caught behind and run-out this series has left to
  offer. I personally hope Siraj takes the last wicket of a dogged English
  resistance at 6pm after a bail swap à la Stuart Broad. And to the OBO, i’m
  eternally grateful for your coverage.” Sit down with your mates? Madness.
  Darkened room more like. And the pleasure is all ours. Thanks for tuning in.
  18th over: England 59-1 (Duckett 38, Pope 5) Rinse and repeat! Duckett is
  beaten FOUR times in the over by Siraj. Four. (That’s insane etc etc). Siraj
  has his dander well and truly up (when doesn’t he?) and is getting the ball to
  dance off this day four surface. Two of those four were absolute snorters,
  jagging off the surface and cutting Duckett in two like a bearded and pint
  sized Debbie McGee. (ask your da). A maiden, obviously. 17th over: England
  59-1 (Duckett 38, Pope 5) Akash is probing, just a single to Duckett off the
  over. If England bat through this first session unscathed then India will
  start to get a bit jittery. Shubman Gill’s captaincy has not been the most
  robust in his first Test series, England will want him sweating under his
  baggy blue this afternoon. 16th over: England 58-1 (Duckett 37, Pope 5)
  Duckett clubs a single to point. Eeeeesht! Pope drives uppishly and with
  little control and the ball skims just short of the man at cover before
  tracing away across the square for four. Cue a nervy gasp and then throaty
  cheer from the England fans. Settle down Ollie lad. 15th over: England 53-1
  (Duckett 36, Pope 1) Akash Deep starts from the Vauxhall End to his old mate
  and cuddle chum Ben Duckett. Ahem. The pint sized batter clips off his ribs to
  get a single and Pope gets off the mark with an inside edge to square leg.
  Early signs of some in-swing. Deep gets some more movement to Duckett who gets
  a thicker edge past the infield for another single. How are your nerves? It’s
  all a bit much for Paul in Brazil: “Hi. Deep breaths, can they? Will they ?
  More deep breaths. An enjoyable day ahead!” 14th over: England 50-1 (Duckett
  34, Pope 0) Pope defends the first ball of the day solidly to mid-off. Cue a
  huge cheer from the England fans in the ground. It’s a sell out here at the
  Oval and I reckon a fifty/fifty split between England and India fans. The
  atmosphere is fan-flippin-tastic. Right, the players are out there, Jerusalem
  swirls down the Harleyford Road. Mohammed Siraj has one ball left to complete
  his over from last evening. Ollie Pope is on strike. Let’s play! “Hi James,
  keen to know why Woakes cannot be subbed now he’s retired hurt? Surely it’s
  only fair for England to have a full Second Innings? I’m obviously missing
  some arcane cricketing law, can you enlighten me please?” It’s exactly that
  Chris Aird, a player is currently only allowed a sub for a concussion injury.
  The debate has been swirling in this series due to Pant and Woakes getting
  crocked in the early stages of Test’s 4 and 5. Injury replacements are due to
  be trialled by some first class boards later in the year… but as I argued in
  this week’s Spin, injury replacements aren’t perhaps as straightforward as
  you’d think. PLUG ALERT: “Hello Jim” G’morning OBO stalwart Krishnamoorthy.
  “Another Test series coming to an end which is making sure that Test cricket
  is alive and kicking in the dark times of T20. Probably this is the first Test
  in this series that is not going to the last session of day 5. It does not
  matter if it is 3-1 or 2-2 , the winner is cricket and India has a wonderful
  core around which it can surely build itself into a formidable team. Today’s
  battle is going to be between the determination of the Indian team vs one J E
  Root” About time Root got a score. My money is on Brook and Bethell romping it
  home*. *It absolutely isn’t. But it could be. (It isn’t) The Indian players
  are out on the outfield here at the Oval, the bowlers getting those shoulders
  loose and the catchers getting their fingers warm. I have them down as
  overwhelming favourites today, yesterday England seemed a spent force and
  suffered their worst day of the series. The wicket of Crawley last thing
  tipped the scales still further in the visitor’s favour. But the great thing
  about Test cricket and this England side is you just never know. They could go
  down in a ball of flames before lunch or take it right down to the wire.
  Remember they knocked off a similar target serenely in Leeds but that was
  twenty long days of cricket ago. C’mon then, fling me your predictions.
  Matthew Doherty emails in with if not the 64 million dollar question then
  certainly a question. “Hello James, who do you think England’s Jessop is
  today?” All roads lead to Jamie Overton. Our main man Ali Martin has the
  skinny on what will happen in the result of a drawn Anderson-Tendulkar: Here’s
  his take on a galling Saturday for England: England’s performance in the field
  yesterday was more chaotic than the basket of a Sunday morning Lime bike
  basket. A discarded vape here, six (SIX) dropped catches there. Is that a
  splodge of fruit and nut bar? Please tell me it’s fruit and nut bar… Oh look
  that’s definitely five wides. Would it have happened if Ben Stokes was
  prowling at short cover with his fatherly death stare? We’ll never know. But
  we sort of already do. It’s been 144 hours and 24 days, since that sun soaked
  Test at Headingley (ahh ahhh ahh ahhhhhh) Test cricket. Nothing compares 2 U.
  As we stare down the barrel of a high summer sold to the money men we have one
  last day of the really good stuff to savour and this series is on the line.
  England need to knock off 324 runs to win it 3-1 but after Zak Crawley had his
  off stump splattered by the indomitable Mohammed Siraj with the last ball of
  play yesterday and with Chris Woakes sporting a sling, India (probably) need
  just eight wickets to do the business and level things up at 2-2. Its been a
  punishing series. One full of great moments rather than being truly great but
  it deserves a grandstand finish. There are some weary minds and bodies here at
  the Oval this August Sunday morning (and that’s just the press pack arf-arf)
  So, for what is surely the last time in Tests this summer, come take the OBOs
  re-assuring hand and let’s see this thing out together. Play starts at 11am.
  Get in touch why dontcha.

Ali Martin’s first hit is in, so I’ll wrap it up there. Thanks for joining me – shame we couldn’t see it through till the end. Here’s to a dramatic morning. Here’s what Joe Root had to say about Graham Thorpe after his tribute to the England great: he took out a headband and wore it to celebrate reaching three figures. Root told the BBC: He is someone that has impacted the game in this country as player, as a coach, as a mentor, as a friend. That gesture wasn’t just from me, it was from our whole dressing room. It’s been great to see everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people. Stuart Broad has entered the conversation. Tom Keil makes a valid point. Cricket really doesn’t do itself any favours sometimes. Surely, they should have done everything they could to get it dry in 30 minutes and then have an inspection at 6.30. If it’s still wet, call it off then. But to make that decision early, with the series on the line, a full house at the oval, and millions watching and listening, is seriously frustrating. I would imagine there will be a lot of very distracted people across offices and work places between 11-12 tomorrow! Richard Gibbs writes: Surprise to see you say that England would be happy with the break...4 overs until the new ball. So India will start tomorrow with their bowlers rested. A great point, bringing Akash Deep firmly back into the game, too. My argument was that England just looked so frazzled out there, with every ball bringing danger. They needed something to take the sting out. To rub things in, the Oval looks glorious at the moment, sun beaming down, fans still getting their Instagram pics in before security boots them out. Our very own Philip Cornwall has got himself in trouble. Hi from Madagascar, Taha. Last Sunday the sporting gods shone on me, and gave me a one-hour delay on the flight here, so I could follow the Lionesses’ extra time and penalties in the queue for the flight here. Now the payback: I will be on the plane back from 6.10am BST until 3.50pm BST and will have no idea how the cricket ends till then. Could be the longest flight of my life. James Walsh writes in: F, and, I can’t emphasise this enough, F S. How are we supposed to handle this? Seems very appropriate though. Free entry tomorrow?! I’ve been informed that Surrey have sold out their day five tickets. A reminder then: England need 35 runs, India four wickets (including Chris Woakes in a sling). It’s pretty tough to call. England probably needed that break more than India, the two batters struggling to find the middle, with Siraj and Krishna thundering through on adrenaline. India’s supporters were on top, too. Before all of that, we had staggering tons from Harry Brook and Joe Root. But if England do lose from here, there will be plenty of focus on how the former got out, the bat flying out of his hand as he charged Akash Deep. That’s how the game works. Play has been abandoned. The series enters the fifth day of the fifth Test – and remains undecided. James Brough writes in: On the face of it, this looks like it should be easy from here. 150 partnership. Less than a hundred to win. Wickets in hand. And yet. Woakes probably can’t bat. Stokes isn’t next man in. We’ve a pretty inexperienced lower order. And most of all, through this series, every time one team has been on top something has happened. India’s tail collapsed. The ball ran from a defensive shot on to the stumps. A catcher trod on the boundary rope. How ironic if, after all his efforts, the deciding moment is Siraj’s foot. Is there just one more twist to come? It might be a cliché, but I keep thinking of John Cleese’s line in Clockwise. “It’s not the despair. I can take the despair. It’s the hope.” It seems to have stopped raining. The question now is whether they can clean up in time. Nick Parish provides hope of play. It’s brightened up in the last couple of minutes. Thanks for the great commentary. The cricket reports are great but I am bewildered by your weather reports. I am about 5 miles south-west of the Oval and it continues to be warm and sunny. Keep the faith for more play tonight, and maybe even an England victory. Richard Morris writes in: My office is right next to The Oval - I can see the gas holders from the window. So ideally it’s going to rain for the next two hours, and then magically tomorrow morning there will be the greatest hour of play in the history of cricket available on my doorstep for a tenner. I may have to delay the all agency status meeting.... Another day five finish? Seems about right for this series. The rain has eased a little, with a drenched Lee Fortis surveying the arrangement of covers. It’s properly coming down now. I don’t think we’re playing any more cricket tonight. Prasidh Krishna has three for 109 off 22.2 overs. Mohammed Siraj has two for 95 off 26. They’ve given everything over the last half-hour, resuscitating India. Ian Sargeant deadpans: “This is really whetting my appetite for the Hundred. Can’t wait for that to start …” Tim Stafford writes: “It’s gonna be Woakes to hit the winning runs. You know it, I know it, the OBO knows it…” I can’t take the drama, Tim. It’s too much. Give me five, I need a chamomile tea. Chris Woakes is in his whites, with a sling on. Oh, and it’s raining. And India are appealing for a caught behind off Overton. WHAT IS GOING ON? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THIS? The umpire reviews to check for a bump ball; it’s hard to tell if Overton’s hit it, and the batter remains. Oh and now they’re checking the light. We’re going off. I’m going to throw my laptop at something. 76th over: England 339-6 (Smith 2, Overton 0) Smith is such a composed batter, but I’ve never seen him like this. He keeps swishing and missing outside off, Siraj in disbelief that he hasn’t found the edge. It’s a maiden. England need 35 to win. It’s seriously on-edge out there, but Oliver Pattenden has a seriously urgent question: “When was the last partnership between a pair of Jamies?” 75th over: England 339-6 (Smith 2, Overton 0) Smith sends Overton back to avoid a run-out, England looking frazzled out there in the middle. Runs off the bat has become an impossible task … but Smith finally finds relief with a dig into the off side for one. Overton stops Krishna in his run-through twice, distracted by something in the background. They eventually finish the over, Overton still waiting for his first run. England need 35 to win. 74th over: England 338-6 (Smith 1, Overton 0) It’s another leg bye as Smith gets off strike, with Jamie Overton facing up for the first time. Siraj is alive again, rattling the top of Overton’s pad. The bat has disappeared from this game in the last few overs. An inside-edge follows … on to the pad. Overton hangs on. England need 36 to win. The Indian fans in the ground have raised the volume in the last couple of overs. Krishna angles the ball in and it’s another lbw shout against Root … the finger doesn’t go up and Gill decides to review. There’s no inside-edge … but the ball’s shown to be missing leg stump. The ball continues to rattle the pads as Smith collects a leg-bye. Root digs out a yorker as Siraj turns to the Indian supporters and applauds their work. And then the wicket. Wow. Root swishes his bat outside off and gets the edge, Jurel holding on. England need 37 to win. It looks far away now. 73rd over: England 337-6 (Smith 1, Overton 0) 72nd over: England 335-5 (Smith 1, Root 105) Siraj launches into another leg-before shout before Root brings the home crowd some relief with a single. Smith gets plenty of applause for his first run, a punch to mid-on. Another leg-before shout follows against Root, though it looks a bit high. It’s a top over from the India quick. England need 39 to win. Chris Purcell sees darkness on the horizon. Oh no, the great collapse of ‘25. Still, it’s been a reasonably good summer. Sigh. 71st over: England 332-5 (Smith 0, Root 104) Jamie Smith begins with an inside-edge on to his pads, and Krishna, tail up, ends the over by beating the bat, very nearly taking out off stump in the process. Oh this is good, very good. England need 42 to win. Jacob Bethell is having to battle here as Krishna gets the ball to leap past the outside edge. When Bethell gets ball on bat, he finds the fielder. And here comes the end: Bethell tries to break out of his funk by charging Krishna but his middle stump is uprooted via an edge. The tension is back. 70th over: England 331-4 (Bethell 5, Root 103) Siraj, with a slow, fairly exhausted walk back to his mark, launches again and again. He closes his over with the hands dropping to his knees. England need 43 to win. Peter Moss writes in after a googly exhibition: A mid afternoon check-in from a sunny Luxembourg park just in time for the Root ton, how lovely it is to see England whittling the target away. Was teaching my boys the wrong’un earlier (or my poor attempt at it) with a stage 3 tennis ball to the amusement of the locals. I think I may have pulled something I shouldn’t. Now time to lay on the picket blanket and check on the chaps bringing home the bacon. A welcome release for England as Deep sends it down the leg side and past the reach of Jurel, five wides the result. And then the clip to the leg side for two, giving Joe Root another hundred, his third in three Tests. That’s 39 in his career, taking him past Kumar Sangakkara in the all-time charts. He briefly dons a headband as a tribute to Graham Thorpe and points to the sky, a lovely nod to his old batting coach. Bethell then finds runs by threading the ball through point for four. England need 44 to win. 69th over: England 330-4 (Bethell 5, Root 102) 68th over: England 318-4 (Bethell 1, Root 99) Siraj skips in … and Root immediately dabs into the offside for one. He’s on to 99. Bethell, still trying to settle, hangs in there as Siraj goes around the wicket, hunting for stumps. The left-hander is on one after 22 deliveries. England need 56 to win. 67th over: England 317-4 (Bethell 1, Root 98) And we’re back, with Deep bowling to Bethell, who drives his second ball nicely … but straight to mid-on. The southpaw gets the opportunity to cut, but doesn’t beat the field. It’s a maiden. England need 57 to win. Tom Walling writes in: Greetings from sweltering Seville. 39° (and I had to pop out for more beer!) I had very little faith we’d get there, having been brought up on 90s England, but now we’re here, I have no doubt we’ll do it. Vagaries of time eh? Also, I may have drunk something. Thanks for everything, OBO people. Andy Hockley is pretty busy: I’m reporting in from the village of Foxton, where the home team, last year’s national village champions, are taking on Hambledon “the cradle of cricket” in this year’s semi final. A trip to Lords up for grabs today. Trying to watch both matches simultaneously is quite challenging (though the lads manning the bar have elected to focus on the test) I’m glad to report that the sun is out at the Oval, with the players starting to make their way out. Some Might Say is playing through the speakers. And now it’s hit me that the Test summer will be done in the next hour or two. Sad. It’s a slightly delayed restart, with a bit of a clean-up job ongoing after some light rain. We’ll be back on at 4.30pm BST. Zia Faruqi sends in a pretty decent one-liner: “Will Lee Fortis put an arm around Gambhir?” 66th over: England 317-4 (Bethell 1, Root 98) Siraj nips it back sharply into Root and is desperate for the leg-before … the finger does not go up. India review, primarily because of their situation, but impact is outside off stump. Root clips the next ball for two and then dabs the ball low, past the cordon, to the ropes – that’s immaculate batting. And then a straight drive for four more, just out of Siraj’s reach, taking Root to 98. He’s on for a ton before tea, but it’s a dot to finish the session. England need 57 to win. They really should do it from here. 65th over: England 307-4 (Bethell 1, Root 88) Nearly a chance. Bethell gets his pull shot all wrong, finding the bottom of the bat, the ball lobbing high into the air … but it gets over Deep, who can’t pull off the turnaround to take a stunner. Deep then beats the outside edge but Bethell resists. It’s a rare sight: a maiden. England need 67 to win. 64th over: England 307-4 (Bethell 1, Root 88) Siraj, finding the last of his reserves, sends in the yorker to Bethell, how he got out in the first innings. The left-hander digs it out before clipping for one to get up and running. Root closes the over with a lush cover drive to the ropes. England need 67 to win. Some fair analysis here from Farhan … though it’s not done yet: I think a lot of us knew we were going to see yet another sequel of England’s chasing masterclass under Baz when India set them another target in the 370s. Indians are an I can attest will be sick and tired of starring in the same movie all over again. This may well be the most impressive of the three given the pitch is perhaps the toughest of the 3 chases, even though this time it does seem to be getting better for batting as the game goes on. Indians have bowled pretty well, but will lose the game and the series thanks to not having real answers to the brilliant English game plan and perhaps due to better familiarity with home conditions. It also did not help that India’s plan for a green grassy track involved 3 pacers and 2 spinners. 63rd over: England 301-4 (Bethell 0, Root 83) Jacob Bethell, in his first home Test, makes his way out. Welcome to the circus, pal. England need 73 to win. Max Williams sent this in before that wicket … Weird parallels with the Oval test of the 2023 Ashes. Both sides make scores in the 200s with Australia holding a narrow lead. England then smash 390 odd in the third innings. A big fourth wicket partnership takes Australia to 264-3 but ultimately they fall 49 runs short and draw the series 2-2. Deep floats up the juiciest of half-volleys and Brook wallops through the covers for four; Siraj, rolling on the carpet, looks absolutely cooked. Another boundary follows before the wildest of dismissals! Brook charges a length ball but miscues, his bat flying out of the hands to the leg side, the ball to Siraj at cover. Brook leaves with a standing ovation. Time for a twist? 62nd over: England 289-3 (Brook 103, Root 83) Siraj returns, reaching the end of his five-Test marathon. What a slog. There’s an issue with the footholes at the crease, so out comes a member of the ground staff to hammer away, allowing for a mid-over break. When play resumes, Root guides the ball behind point for four. The tension is being sucked out here. England need 81 to win. Dean Kinsella writes: My mate Tom reckons Shubman should offer to shake hands on this! David Howell sends this in: On the overall balance of play, England have no right to win this series 3-1... ..but picking three seamers on purpose, on a greentop, at the end of a draining series, is straight out of the Guinness Book of Sporting Blunders I remember reading and re-reading as a kid. I dread to think what apoplexy awaits from the Indian media if England do manage to complete the job of punishing that. Oh dear, Akash Deep has had a shocker there. Brook drives Sundar to deep extra cover and a tired Deep tries to boot it away with his left; it ricochets off his body and finds the rope. Brook then nabs two behind point, allowing him to celebrate his 10th Test hundred in his 30th match: a phenomenal record, a phenomenal player. This is up there with his best. 61st over: England 286-3 (Brook 101, Root 78) England need 88 to win. 60th over: England 279-3 (Brook 94, Root 78) Jadeja switches ends and the crowd roars after a Root single, pleased by the number on the big screen: England need 100 to win. There’s another cheer when it goes down to 99. Is this how it’s going to be till the finish? Jadeja, uncharacteristically, slips out a full toss to close the over and Root dispatches it to the leg side for four. England need 95 to win. 59th over: England 273-3 (Brook 93, Root 73) There’s light rain in the air as Root hotfoots it to the striker’s end for a quick single off Washington Sundar. The singles keep on coming as the umpires converge … we’ll play on. England need 101 to win. 58th over: England 270-3 (Brook 92, Root 71) Krishna finds a tasty line outside off stump to Root before providing some width; England’s No 4 gets his cut all wrong, failing to take advantage. Never mind, a gorgeous on-drive follows, bringing him two. An upper-cut is next, the single keeping Root on strike for the next over. England need 104 to win. Adam Roberts is loving it. Just gone 9 here in Cayman and I am glued to the tv and the OBO. My wife thought better of it than asking me to join her in a swim. Looks like Joe had a long chat with himself after the first innings and Krishna can chirp all he wants - Joe will keep his head down and score more runs 57th over: England 265-3 (Brook 92, Root 66) India need to find their voices in the field; the current noise is all Brook and Root, calling for their ones. They take three singles off Jadeja. England need 109 to win. 56th over: England 261-3 (Brook 91, Root 64) Root mistimes a pull shot, the ball plopping close by on the offside; they still run through for a single. England need 112 to win. Brian Withington writes in: Am I alone in feeling that this series can’t possibly be complete unless and until a strapped up last man Chris Woakes comes out to face the second new ball one handed with two runs needed? 55th over: England 257-3 (Brook 89, Root 61) Jadeja goes a touch short and Brook pulls away to the deep midwicket rope for four, everything – hands, feet, mind – working so quickly to play that stroke. England need 117 to win. 54th over: England 251-3 (Brook 84, Root 60) Krishna is on from the Pavilion End, a short-ball field set. Brook tries the audacious, backing away to the leg side to try and swat through off … the ball is a touch high and eventually called a wide. A pull shot brings one before Root does the same two balls later. That’s 250 for England and the Oval crowd, very much entertained, show their love. England need 123 to win. 53rd over: England 246-3 (Brook 82, Root 58) Afternoon, lovely people. The floodlights are beaming down at the Oval, India returning to their positions after an important huddle at drinks. It’s Ravindra Jadeja who Shubman Gill turns to for the first time in the innings … and Root smashes the second ball down the ground for four. Harry Brook, probably itching to join in on the fun, stays calm to knock a single into the leg side. Root closes the over with one, too. Let’s get the countdown going, I reckon. England need 128 to win. 52nd over: England 239-3 (Root 52, Brook 81) Prasidh replaces Siraj and is clipped for two singles. That takes England to drinks with 135 more runs needed to pull off a famous run chase, the highest at the Oval. I’m off for slurp of something cold in the stands, thanks for your company, it’s been a riot. Taha Hashim is here to call the last rites of this memorable Test series. 51st over: England 237-3 (Root 51, Brook 80) Harry Brook unleashes a pull so blistering off Akash Deep that it can barely be seen by fielders or the crowd. Fair to say Brook saw it all the way. Gloomy at the Oval but England are feeling golden at the moment. 50th over: England 228-3 (Root 50, Brook 74) Joe Root goes to fifty with a pull for four off Siraj! A shy wave of the bat from Root, he knows there’s plenty left to do. Siraj bends his back and tries to get something going with short stuff but there’s nowt doing for India at the moment. 49th over: England 221-3 (Root 49, Brook 68) The Oval emits a deep purring sound as Harry Brook drives on the up and sends a ball from Akash Deep to the hoardings at deep point. Those hands are ridic. Root clips for four more and follows up with a compact drive for three, England collect twelve runs off the over. England fans - are you starting to believe? 48th over: England 209-3 (Root 42, Brook 63) Root runs another liquid single to backward point. Siraj gets some bite from a short ball that lifts and jags back onto Brook’s thigh pad. Don’t rub it, Don’t rub it*. “Henry Ford was an OBO guy” writes Alex McGillivray who is currently “rolling through the mean streets of suburban Detroit feeling as rough as Tarzan’s feet, looking for a breakfast joint after yesterday’s Dearborn Homecoming. Thank God for VPNs.” *Was that a Kings of Leon lyric? 47th over: England 208-3 (Root 41, Brook 63) The lights come on once more at the Oval with Akash Deep charging in. These aren’t the easiest batting conditions but Root and Brook have made batting look remarkably simple out there. Another hour of this and England could be home and hosed. You just know a wicket changes the whole complexion though. 46th over: England 206-3 (Root 40, Brook 62) England happy to tick over in singles and twos, the latter of which from Root brings up the 100 partnership and is met with a rousing cheer from the home support. 45th over: England 203-3 (Root 38, Brook 61) Root and Brook scamper three singles off Siraj. Everyone in the ground well and truly lasered in on this chase now. 44th over: England 200-3 (Root 37, Brook 59) The England fans in the crowd stand, applaud and cheer as a Brook single off Siraj brings up England’s 200. Richard Neal is getting his James Bond opening scene on. Bond was definitely an OBO guy. “Been driving through the French Alps down to the coast, currently passing Marseille. Deprived of other coverage, you’re a lifeline. Here’s hoping Harry is still hitting them huge when we get to Hyeres in an hour!” 43rd over: England 196-3 (Root 36, Brook 57) Washington Sundar is summoned for a bowl from the Vauxhall End. He’s had a knack of picking up wickets in clumps in this series. How will Harry Brook treat the spin? He and Root both have a look, nudging singles from deep in the crease. Sundar then drops short and is BOSHED away off the back foot by Brook. Desmond Niall Mullen has got his teeth gritted. “Hey Jim, India might, like me in university, deserve a 2-2 but, as a wise man once said, deserve’s got nothin’ to do with it.” 42nd over: England 190-3 (Root 35, Brook 52) India want to bowl at Joe Root and put the pressure on him but he’s such a class act that he picks off the singles and then skims a full ball from Siraj through midwicket for four. Like a pebble across plate glass. England go past the halfway mark in this chase and the Barmy Army are well aware. Cue some Bon Jovi parps from the trumpeter. 184 runs plays 6 (or 7…) wickets. 41st over: England 186-3 (Root 31, Brook 52) Brook brings up his fifty off just 38 balls to much acclaim in the crowd. He was on 19 when Siraj spilled him. “Sat at Waterloo station, recovering from my 12-hour stag-do in Soho last night.” Writes Jim Kerr. “Hopefully this next two hours is gonna stop me from sleeping all the way to Southampton Central.” 12 hours in Soho? Sending solidarity – more than enough to give you a simple mind this Sunday afternoon. Sorry, it’s been a loooong morning/series. 40th over: England 181-3 (Root 29, Brook 49) Siraj to start from the Pavilion End with a point to prove and a mistake to atone for. Joe Root oozes class as he glides Siraj down through the needlepoint for four with velvet soft hands. A solid defensive push into the covers elicits another single. 39th over: England 175-3 (Root 24, Brook 48) A single each to Brook and Root off Krishna before the more vociferous England supporters in the crowd give Siraj a decent serve as he dives onto the sponge to try and stop a Brook flick through midwicket in vain. Four runs. The lights are on at the Oval, feels very much like bowling conditions. Not that Harry Brook gives a fig, a meaty edge flies right through the gap in the slips and away for four more. Righto. Here come the players for the afternoon session. Buckle up knuckleheads. “Hello Jim ! On the one hand, I’ve been to eight T20 games this summer, and seen three boundary catches where the fielder has calmly tossed the ball up, stepped over the boundary, stepped back in and completed the catch. It’s a practised routine now. On the other hand, on this ground in 2005, it was the bowler who had carried the visiting attack through five Tests who dropped that catch. Fatigue plays its part.” Don’t forget this one Tim Sanders, Boult had bowled New Zealand to the brim of the World Cup in 2019. England got over the line that day but I wouldn’t put it past Mohammed Siraj to reduce his drop to a mere footnote and bend this game India’s way this afternoon with his skill and sheer force of character. A lunchtime wade into the OBO mailbag reveals a rapt audience from Helsinki to Hong Kong, Lake Bled, Belize and Brixton. Fan flipping tastic. How great that we are at lunch on day 24 of this series and it’s still in the balance. In a few hours we’ll know if it is 3-1 to England or a 2-2 draw that India more than deserve. BIG FIRST HOUR after lunch. England dine in Hell three down with 210 more runs to get. India need six more wickets (Hello Chris, can you hold a bat?… Chris?) What a morning of Test cricket that was, we hoped for a barnstorming finish to this series and it seems to be happening. England plundered 114 runs for the loss of two wickets in that session, something similar this afternoon and it will be game very much on. I’m off for a toke on some smelling salts. Back soon. 38th over: England 164-3 (Root 23, Brook 38) Here is the moment of the morning/series: 37th over: England 162-3 (Root 22, Brook 37) Brook steers a single past point and everyone just chills out a little bit as Joe Root comes on strike and plays out a calm four dots and an easy single off the last. Root is aloe vera to Brook’s screaming sunburn, the end of night kebab to Brook’s ten pints and hugging strangers on the night tube. Hold us, Joe. 36th over: England 160-3 (Root 21, Brook 36) Siraj’s sponge inflected catch keeps being shown on the big screen to loud cheers from the English. *In case you needed reminding, cricket is a cruel cruel sport*. Akash Deep slings five wides down the leg side which doesn’t help Shubman Gill’s conniptions. There are five minutes til lunch, I imagine England will just block it out. Cue manic laughter. 35th over: England 153-3 (Root 20, Brook 35) Ok. It’s all kicking off the Oval. Brook follows up his near miss with a flay over the covers for four and then ramps over the slips entirely deliberately for four more. Sixteen runs off the over. It doesn’t feel sustainable but by flip it’s good fun. Oh my oh my oh my! Harry Brook swivel pulls Prasidh Krishna but the shot doesn’t quite have the legs… the ball swirls and whirls in the grey South London sky before landing safely in Siraj’s hands at deep fine leg… BUT BUT BUT BUT in taking the catch he stumbles onto the rope! Shades of Trent Boult in the World Cup final, Siraj can’t believe it, the English crowd go doolally! Brook survives and gets a six to boot. I AM CALM! 34th over: England 137-3 (Root 20, Brook 19) The lights come back on at the Oval but the gloam doesn’t mither Harry Brook – Deep drops short and is spanked through midwicket for four and then Brook follows with a charge down the wicket and a spank for SIX. England playing quietly for lunch then… the latter was some shot from Brook, one that has quickly become his trademark. Do not adust your set. 33rd over: England 126-3 (Root 20, Brook 8) Prasidh is too full to Root and it’s very much a case of don’t bowl there son as the great one pings him through cover for four. 32nd over: England 121-3 (Root 16, Brook 7) Deep replaces Siraj and stitches together a maiden, allowing me to scurry off and get a vat of Press office Kenco in the process. 31st over: England 121-3 (Root 16, Brook 7) Brook plays with hard hands at a length ball outside off and squirts an edge past the cordon for four. GET US A COLD ONE THEN ROSS?! Ah OK… a quote from Homer will have to do I suppose. Hi James, I’m keeping up to date from a little taverna on the shores of Syros in the Aegean. I’ve just ordered a second beer following Pope’s wicket, and am wondering is this a Herculean effort required now, or completely within Root and Brook’s arc? Hard to know with Bazball, but as Homer said (roughly): “Let us not die ingloriously and without struggle, but let us first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.” Having said that, I’m not sure there are any Homeric lines on the virtue of a draw after 6 weeks of battle?” 30th over: England 114-3 (Root 15, Brook 1) Siraj into his eighth over on the spin. He’s been the star bowler in this series and the only one that has stayed the distance - playing in every Test (with apologies to Chris Woakes). He’s incredibly skilful, getting the ball to talk on surfaces both dead and alive, all the while appearing like there’s nowhere else he’d rather be and giving it absolutely everything. Getting in the opposition’s face with a smile on his own. What a player. All flowers to him as they say these days. 29th over: England 113-3 (Root 14, Brook 1) Root unfurls a perfect cover drive off Krishna. “Talk nah Prasidh”. “If England could just imagine Ben Stokes is on the field, in their ears, cajoling, supporting, advising them, they’d be half way to an improbable victory.” He very much is looming over proceedings on the Oval balcony, Andrew Benton. England need something Stokesian now. You feel like this is the crucial partnership between Root and Brook. It could all be over quickly if one of them falls before lunch. 28th over: England 108-3 (Root 8, Brook 0) Siraj starts with a bouncer to Brook. ‘Arry needs a score here. He’s got 99 and a ton in the series but England need him to show his full talent, put his money where his mouth is and get a significant score. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, Siraj scuds one in to Ollie Pope’s pad and the Surrey man has to go! It kept a little low and pranged him in front of leg stump. Pope knows it but takes a review with him. Oh, here comes Harry Brook. This’ll be nice and calm for everyone then. 27th over: England 101-2 (Pope 27, Root 3)Shot! A collective coo goes around the ground as Pope drives Krishna back down the ground for four and then clips sublimely off his pads for another boundary through midwicket. Fout more! A pull traces away across the baize and the sun comes out on cue! What was in the ginger ninja’s drink? I’ll have what he’s having. The Barmy Army trumpeter parps up with ‘Feeling hot hot hot’. Scenes. That’s the hundred up for England. 273 more to go. 26th over: England 87-2 (Pope 13, Root 3) Phew. A nerve jangling first hour comes to a close with a Mo Siraj maiden. The bowler is convinced Root got a tickle behind to a length ball that ducked in but Gill and Jadeja consult with Jurel and decide not to review. Wisely, DRS shows there was nowt doing. Time for a drink. Speaking of which… “Hi Jimbo Hopefully the sunshiiiiiiiiiiiiiine’s on England today otherwise this series could slide away which isn’t part of the Bazterplan. Yours biblically, a Wembley bound Gary and Pam Stableford.” 25th over: England 87-2 (Pope 13, Root 3) Root survives a HUGE appeal from Krishna and the cordon! A full ball that jagged back and hit him on the knee roll. An achingly long wait before the umpire shakes his head. India thought they had their man there. DRS shows it was clipping leg stump enough to be Umpires’s call but India didn’t send it upstairs. A heart in mouth maiden for both sides. 24th over: England 86-2 (Pope 13, Root 3) Knife edge stuff, it’s gone very gloomy and India can smell wickets in the murk. Root and Pope do well to weather an accurate over from Siraj, rotating strike for three singles. Thanks for all your emails – keep them coming in. “Hey, James. It’s Prakhar from India. I want to make a trade here. I don’t want Root to perform well today but I want him to have the ‘series of his life’ in a few months in Australia. Are you okay with this trade?” NO DEAL! 23rd over: England 83-2 (Pope 12, Root 1) Joe Root is the new man. He sprints onto the Oval turf to a chorus of Rooooots. Reckon Krishna might have a little word in his ear? See if he can get a rise. You would, wouldn’t you? England need a Joseph Edward Root special right here, right now. Root… is off the mark first ball with a single clipped to leg. It’s gone a bit gloomy in South London. The lights have come on. England’s flame is flickering. GONE GONE GONE! Duckett flashes a drive at new bowler Prasidh Krishna and gets a meaty edge that is swallowed by KL Rahul in the cordon. India celebrate with tons of gusto, Gill haring across the outfield with hand raised like peak Alan Shearer. That’s a big wicket. 22nd over: England 82-1 (Duckett 54, Pope 12) Duckett goes to fifty with a fortunate edge wide of the cordon and away for four. He raises his bat somewhat sheepishly, aware there is plenty more to do. England’s target is hauled below three hundred. Roving/Rotter Reporter Jake Farrell flings his first missive from the Bedser lower stand here at the Oval. “Kuldeep Yadav is holding court. Almost prompted Beatles-esque fainting by offering an unprompted “Morning ladies” to a couple of punters. Now talking the ear off some kind of security guard in military garb. Very very #classy stuff. Has the air of a proud father of the bride at a wedding, taking it all in.” Dear Old Kuldeep would do a job today I reckon. Curly Charlie Chaplin Curtains bouncing, ball fizzing. Both teams have been guilty of some puddled selection. 21st over: England 75-1 (Duckett 47, Pope 12) Duckett cuts Deep like Cat Stevens/Sheryl Crow depending on your age/preference. Two runs to the score. England whittling away. Deep sends down a bouncer that the wee man has a flap at and is lucky not to feather to Jurel. “Morning Jim. All four results possible but surely an Indian win is the most likely. Ollie Pope will need a few miracles today, not least his own batting, which is a meagre 18 in 4th innings. Like Steve Smith, but without the good first 3 before it. You hope his love for the Oval may help. You sense that him out early puts all the pressure on Root and Brook again. Lots of things will need to go right. I’m bricking it!” You and a few others too no doubt, Guy Hornsby. 20th over: England 72-1 (Duckett 44, Pope 12) Runs! Duckett clobbers a Siraj half volley through mid-off for four and then glances off his hips for a second boundary in the over. Each cheered wildly. Fair to say England’s fans at the side of me Believe like Cher in ‘97. In other news, get yourself a wife who texts you like Mark Funnell’s: Hi James, camping on the north Cornish coast with my son, I didn’t have any signal for much of yesterday on Porthcothan beach. When we got back to campsite, I recoiled with horror at India’s score. After seeing England’s blistering start, I dropped my wife a text to check whether she was watching. She WhatsApp video’d me to show me what was happening in the game - in real time. The very next ball Siraj bowled that searing Yorker to clean Crawley up. I felt a little sick. She laughed. It was like SHE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.” 19th over: England 61-1 (Duckett 39, Pope 6) Pope and Duckett steal a couple of singles into the covers. To rollocking applause. “The first day of cricket I’m away from the TV and its turned out to be the most important of them. You must summon the spirit of all OBOers past and present to deliver the most vivid OBO to grace my eyes - something you’re well able for I’ve no doubt.” I’m not sure about that Rowan Tewari… but Taha is on later on. “On a more serious note, what a truly incredible series we’ve seen. For all those watching, this is the last day to truly sit down with your mates and savour every drive, caught behind and run-out this series has left to offer. I personally hope Siraj takes the last wicket of a dogged English resistance at 6pm after a bail swap à la Stuart Broad. And to the OBO, i’m eternally grateful for your coverage.” Sit down with your mates? Madness. Darkened room more like. And the pleasure is all ours. Thanks for tuning in. 18th over: England 59-1 (Duckett 38, Pope 5) Rinse and repeat! Duckett is beaten FOUR times in the over by Siraj. Four. (That’s insane etc etc). Siraj has his dander well and truly up (when doesn’t he?) and is getting the ball to dance off this day four surface. Two of those four were absolute snorters, jagging off the surface and cutting Duckett in two like a bearded and pint sized Debbie McGee. (ask your da). A maiden, obviously. 17th over: England 59-1 (Duckett 38, Pope 5) Akash is probing, just a single to Duckett off the over. If England bat through this first session unscathed then India will start to get a bit jittery. Shubman Gill’s captaincy has not been the most robust in his first Test series, England will want him sweating under his baggy blue this afternoon. 16th over: England 58-1 (Duckett 37, Pope 5) Duckett clubs a single to point. Eeeeesht! Pope drives uppishly and with little control and the ball skims just short of the man at cover before tracing away across the square for four. Cue a nervy gasp and then throaty cheer from the England fans. Settle down Ollie lad. 15th over: England 53-1 (Duckett 36, Pope 1) Akash Deep starts from the Vauxhall End to his old mate and cuddle chum Ben Duckett. Ahem. The pint sized batter clips off his ribs to get a single and Pope gets off the mark with an inside edge to square leg. Early signs of some in-swing. Deep gets some more movement to Duckett who gets a thicker edge past the infield for another single. How are your nerves? It’s all a bit much for Paul in Brazil: “Hi. Deep breaths, can they? Will they ? More deep breaths. An enjoyable day ahead!” 14th over: England 50-1 (Duckett 34, Pope 0) Pope defends the first ball of the day solidly to mid-off. Cue a huge cheer from the England fans in the ground. It’s a sell out here at the Oval and I reckon a fifty/fifty split between England and India fans. The atmosphere is fan-flippin-tastic. Right, the players are out there, Jerusalem swirls down the Harleyford Road. Mohammed Siraj has one ball left to complete his over from last evening. Ollie Pope is on strike. Let’s play! “Hi James, keen to know why Woakes cannot be subbed now he’s retired hurt? Surely it’s only fair for England to have a full Second Innings? I’m obviously missing some arcane cricketing law, can you enlighten me please?” It’s exactly that Chris Aird, a player is currently only allowed a sub for a concussion injury. The debate has been swirling in this series due to Pant and Woakes getting crocked in the early stages of Test’s 4 and 5. Injury replacements are due to be trialled by some first class boards later in the year… but as I argued in this week’s Spin, injury replacements aren’t perhaps as straightforward as you’d think. PLUG ALERT: “Hello Jim” G’morning OBO stalwart Krishnamoorthy. “Another Test series coming to an end which is making sure that Test cricket is alive and kicking in the dark times of T20. Probably this is the first Test in this series that is not going to the last session of day 5. It does not matter if it is 3-1 or 2-2 , the winner is cricket and India has a wonderful core around which it can surely build itself into a formidable team. Today’s battle is going to be between the determination of the Indian team vs one J E Root” About time Root got a score. My money is on Brook and Bethell romping it home*. *It absolutely isn’t. But it could be. (It isn’t) The Indian players are out on the outfield here at the Oval, the bowlers getting those shoulders loose and the catchers getting their fingers warm. I have them down as overwhelming favourites today, yesterday England seemed a spent force and suffered their worst day of the series. The wicket of Crawley last thing tipped the scales still further in the visitor’s favour. But the great thing about Test cricket and this England side is you just never know. They could go down in a ball of flames before lunch or take it right down to the wire. Remember they knocked off a similar target serenely in Leeds but that was twenty long days of cricket ago. C’mon then, fling me your predictions. Matthew Doherty emails in with if not the 64 million dollar question then certainly a question. “Hello James, who do you think England’s Jessop is today?” All roads lead to Jamie Overton. Our main man Ali Martin has the skinny on what will happen in the result of a drawn Anderson-Tendulkar: Here’s his take on a galling Saturday for England: England’s performance in the field yesterday was more chaotic than the basket of a Sunday morning Lime bike basket. A discarded vape here, six (SIX) dropped catches there. Is that a splodge of fruit and nut bar? Please tell me it’s fruit and nut bar… Oh look that’s definitely five wides. Would it have happened if Ben Stokes was prowling at short cover with his fatherly death stare? We’ll never know. But we sort of already do. It’s been 144 hours and 24 days, since that sun soaked Test at Headingley (ahh ahhh ahh ahhhhhh) Test cricket. Nothing compares 2 U. As we stare down the barrel of a high summer sold to the money men we have one last day of the really good stuff to savour and this series is on the line. England need to knock off 324 runs to win it 3-1 but after Zak Crawley had his off stump splattered by the indomitable Mohammed Siraj with the last ball of play yesterday and with Chris Woakes sporting a sling, India (probably) need just eight wickets to do the business and level things up at 2-2. Its been a punishing series. One full of great moments rather than being truly great but it deserves a grandstand finish. There are some weary minds and bodies here at the Oval this August Sunday morning (and that’s just the press pack arf-arf) So, for what is surely the last time in Tests this summer, come take the OBOs re-assuring hand and let’s see this thing out together. Play starts at 11am. Get in touch why dontcha.
