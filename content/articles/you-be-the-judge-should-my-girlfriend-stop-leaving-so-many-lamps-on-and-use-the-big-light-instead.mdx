  You be the judge: should my girlfriend stop leaving so many lamps on and use
  the big light instead?

  The prosecution: Monty It seems illogical to have so many lights on in a small
  room. She turns them on, then leaves Mona and I have lived together in
  house-shares since 2017, but in October 2023 we moved into our own place. In
  that time, I’ve noticed that Mona is a big fan of mood lighting and has an
  obsession with small lamps. I didn’t grow up in a house where lamps were on.
  We had the main lighting on at all times, but Mona’s childhood home was
  different. I’ll come home and the house will be ablaze with at least three
  different lamps on in each room. Mona tends to go into a room for a while,
  turn all the lamps on and then leave. Once, I walked into our bedroom to turn
  off the lights. Each time I left, Mona would turn them back on. We repeated
  this loop three times. Mona said she didn’t even know she was doing it. I’m
  not particularly energy-conscious, but it seems really illogical to me to have
  a multitude of lamps on all at once in a small room. I say to Mona, “Can you
  not leave all the lights on?” And she says, “But I like it.” At other times
  she will accept responsibility and say, “Sorry, yes it’s bad.” But it doesn’t
  mean she stops doing it. She says she will try not to keep doing it, but it
  still happens. She also says that she wants to feel safe when I’m travelling
  with work, and having the lamps on is comforting. Sometimes I am gone for
  weeks at a time as I work in events, so I do get it. I would like Mona to feel
  safe, so I don’t mind the extra cost of putting the lamps on when I’m not
  here. We can pay more for the electricity if it makes her feel better, but
  there is still the environmental issue to consider. In order to compromise, I
  would like Mona to think about whether we need all the lamps on when we’re in
  our home together. Surely me being there negates the need to turn all the
  lights on? But I know she likes putting the lamps on for mood and ambience, so
  I don’t think she will change. The defence: Mona I know it’s not
  energy-conscious to have all these lamps on, but I just love cosy mood
  lighting I have 11 lamps in our house. There are three in the bedroom, but
  only one in our kitchen/dining area (I actually think we need more there). I
  like to have them all on at once. I know it’s not very energy-conscious of me,
  but I just love soft mood lighting. I always had it growing up – God forbid
  the big light was ever on in my home. My mum is the same, she’s very
  particular about how her house feels. When I was younger, she would text me
  and say, “Can you get the candles lit for when I get back?” She wanted the
  mood set. My sister loves lamps as well, but not to the level I do. The main
  reason I do it is because Monty is away for weeks at a time with his job. I
  get quite lonely without him, and having multiple lamps on makes the house
  feel more lived-in and cosy. We started living together nearly two years ago
  and Monty went freelance at the same time, so I realised I was going to be on
  my own a lot of the time. Sometimes I can get nervous living alone, and having
  the lights on makes me feel safer and more settled. I’ll admit, I do keep the
  lamp habit up when Monty is at home too. The day he turned the lamps off three
  times, I couldn’t remember turning them back on. It’s a habit: I have lamp
  blindness. I accept I do it too much, but it mainly stems from being on my
  own. I haven’t looked to see if our bills are higher when Monty is away –
  honestly, I don’t want to know. Some of my friends say my habit is a waste of
  money and not very climate-friendly, but I am very careful about that in every
  other area of my life. During winter, I use the big light and the small lamps,
  which is bad, but when I’m alone I don’t have anyone to answer to. My
  favourite things in the world are candles, but it’s not safe to leave them lit
  all evening. To compromise, I do agree that I should try to turn them off when
  Monty is at home. I’m probably not going to stop with the lamp habit entirely
  though. The jury of Guardian readers Should Mona turn out the lights? You
  don’t need several lights on in a room you’re not in, nor a big light and
  small lamps simultaneously. Maybe check the energy consumption of three soft
  lamps v one big light, though! Katharine, 60 Having all the lamps turned on in
  every room at all times is wasteful and unnecessary. Why not keep the lamps on
  only in the occupied room, and maybe the hallway, and if you change rooms,
  swap which lights are on? Sara, 29 Monty mentions the environment, but modern
  LED lighting uses much less power than incandescent bulbs, so Mona’s little
  lamps need only consume a small amount of energy. In return, Mona is feeling
  safer and more comfortable at home. Leave those lights alone, Monty, and be
  grateful she’s given up the candles. Peter, 72 Lamps are indeed splendid –
  they are much more charming than a big light, but it is wasteful to have them
  switched on in rooms that are not being used. When Mona is home on her own I
  understand she may have lamps on in a couple of rooms, but not all of them.
  Rebecca, 46 You can’t put a price on a mood. Monty sounds like he is being a
  mood kill. Having the overhead light on with no lamps is an act of lighting
  terrorism. Team Mona! Arnie, 65 Now you be the judge In our online poll, tell
  us if you think Mona should turn out the lights? The poll closes on Wednesday
