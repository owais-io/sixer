  Students who use keyboards in exams get better test scores, according to new
  research, raising questions about how schools will be affected when digital
  GCSE and A-level exams become widespread. The research carried out at
  University College London tested state school pupils, comparing their scores
  in essays using handwriting and word processors under mock exam conditions.
  All pupils, including those with learning difficulties, made big improvements
  in tests when using word processors. Emma Sumner, a senior lecturer in
  psychology and education at Liverpool John Moores University, who led the
  research, said the “dramatic” improvements meant schools needed to provide
  laptops and teach touch-typing, as examination boards seek to introduce online
  exams within the next five years. Sumner said: “Exams are time-bound and
  require students being able to quickly transcribe their ideas. If typing is
  quicker for the majority, or gives the flexibility to revise without lots of
  crossing outs, then that’s helpful. “Further research really needs to be done
  to understand if, by changing the format, the modality, are you in any way
  changing the assessment? I think that’s really important as a next step.” For
  students without literacy difficulties, more than 50% wrote more words using
  keyboards compared with handwriting. Their test scores rose by 17% on average.
  Students with identified difficulties had an average increase of 14% in test
  scores and produced 31% more words compared with handwriting. Pearson Edexcel
  exam board has said its ambition is to offer the option to take all GCSE exams
  onscreen by 2030, having already run pilot exams in English language and
  English literature. AQA is also planning online GCSEs in a number of subjects
  from 2027, subject to approval by England’s exam regulator, Ofqual. Sumner
  said: “If that is the case, then absolutely schools need to be thinking about
  where touch-typing sits within the curriculum, where it could be put within a
  school day that is already overloaded. “If students are going to be doing
  GCSEs online, then they will have to do mock exams online, and it will cascade
  down from there. It suggests that we need to be thinking about this in line
  with handwriting – I don’t think we should forget about handwriting. “There is
  research to show that handwriting is better for retention and recall of
  information than typing, so there is a cognitive element that handwriting may
  be advantageous.” Students in England are able to use keyboards under exam
  conditions if allowed by their school or centre, as reasonable adjustments for
  those with identified difficulties. The researchers warned that the use of
  keyboards needed to be better monitored by regulators to avoid
  disproportionately helping pupils without special needs. Schools currently do
  not need approval for GCSE candidates to use keyboards, leading to potential
  inequalities around their provision. Sumner said it raised questions about
  whether some schools might be giving pupils an advantage, “perhaps unknowing”,
  while other schools might lack the resources to help those who needed laptops.
  She said: “A lot of the practitioners we spoke to from state schools were so
  committed, they wanted to do right, but they had their hands tied in terms of
  how much staff time they could put into identifying needs or whether they
  could fully support it. “They might have known that a student would do better
  with a word processor, but not having a laptop available meant they couldn’t
  go down that route.” The study involving 156 pupils taking GCSE courses,
  including about half of whom had assessed difficulties, has yet to be
  published or peer reviewed, and Sumner acknowledged it was a “staged
  experiment” using past exam papers, which could affect the results. One
  technological leap forward will be experienced by 100,000 students in England
  this year, who will receive their GCSE results via an “education record” app
  being piloted by the Department for Education.
