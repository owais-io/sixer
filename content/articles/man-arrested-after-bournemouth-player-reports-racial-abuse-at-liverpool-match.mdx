  A 47-year-old man has been arrested after a Bournemouth player reported being
  racially abused during his team’s match against Liverpool on Friday, police
  have said. A second arrest over racist abuse was made at a separate game on
  Saturday at the University of Bradford Stadium, Bradford City AFC said. The
  man from Liverpool was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of a racially
  aggravated public order offence and has been taken into custody to be
  interviewed, Merseyside police said. During Friday’s fixture, Bournemouth’s
  Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator, prompting the
  match referee, Anthony Taylor, to stop play in the 29th minute during the
  first Premier League fixture of the season. A 47-year-old man was ejected from
  the stadium. Ch Insp Kev Chatterton, the match commander for the Liverpool v
  Bournemouth game, previously said: “Merseyside police will not tolerate hate
  crime of any form. “We take incidents like this very seriously, and in cases
  like this we will be proactively seeking football banning orders, with the
  club, against those responsible.” He added: “There is no place for racism and
  it is vital that anyone who witnesses such an offence reports it to stewards,
  or the police immediately, so we can take the necessary action like we did
  this evening. “As with all matches, we work very closely with both Liverpool
  and Everton FC to ensure the safety of the public, and the players.” A
  spokesperson for Liverpool FC said: “Liverpool Football Club is aware of an
  allegation of racist abuse made during our Premier League game against
  Bournemouth. “We condemn racism and discrimination in all forms; it has no
  place in society, or football.” The match referee, Anthony Taylor, spoke with
  the managers Arne Slot and Andoni Iraola after Semenyo reported being abused.
  On Saturday, Bradford City AFC said West Yorkshire police had made an arrest
  during a game at the University of Bradford Stadium. The club said: “Bradford
  City AFC is aware of an allegation of racist abuse from an individual in the
  away section towards one of our players during today’s Sky Bet League One game
  against Luton Town. “Bradford City AFC strongly condemns racism and
  discrimination in all forms. We have a zero tolerance policy to such
  unacceptable behaviour.” In an interview, Bradford’s manager, Graham
  Alexander, said there was no place in football for racism, adding: “We saw it
  last night at the Liverpool game – it has to be zero tolerance. There’s no
  excuse for it, at all.”
