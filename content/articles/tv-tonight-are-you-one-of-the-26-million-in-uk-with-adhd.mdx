  Do You Have ADHD? 8pm, Channel 4 Conversations around attention deficit
  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) feel more prevalent, as awareness and diagnoses
  have both increased in recent years. This programme says, in fact, that an
  estimated 2.6 million people in the UK have the condition. Dr Karan Rajan and
  Dr Clare Bailey Mosley take a deep dive into the subject, answering the most
  common questions and separating fact from fiction. Bailey Mosley even
  undergoes assessment herself. Hollie Richardson The Repair Shop 8pm, BBC One
  David was a dedicated beekeeper whose daughter, Ruth, from Nottinghamshire,
  commissioned a portrait of him with his bees, painted on concrete. He has
  since died and the painting is a little weather-worn. Can conservator Lucia
  Scalisi restore it for Ruth? It’s just one of the tasks in this week’s roundup
  of visits to the repair shop. HR The Great British Sewing Bee 9pm, BBC One A
  nice change of pace this week as a celebration of the textile traditions of
  Korea brings with it a guest judge, designer Eudon Choi. Along with taekwondo
  outfits in the transformation challenge, there’s the chance to be inspired by
  two historical garments revived by modern Korean style: the jeogori and the
  cheollik. Jack Seale Pompeii: Life in the City With Dan Snow 9pm, Channel 5
  Dan Snow discovers graffiti of gladiators drawn by children 2,000 years ago as
  he continues to explore a current excavation at Pompeii. Co-tour guide Dr Kate
  Lister, meanwhile, finds a luxury villa, boasting three gardens and a private
  bath house. HR The Nazi Cartel 9pm, Sky Documentaries The gripping series
  revealing how an ex-Gestapo officer helped to shape Bolivia into being the
  world’s first narco-state continues. In 1980, undercover DEA agent Michael
  Levine is working to prevent the influential Suárez family from running
  cocaine into the US. But the Bolivian political landscape is about to
  violently change. Might a rival agency be involved? Graeme Virtue Creature
  Commandos 10pm, Sky Max James Gunn’s oddball adult cartoon continues, with the
  origin story of Dr Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk) kicking off the penultimate
  episode. When that tale of bloody revenge is done with, the gang gather to
  prepare for a final showdown with Rostovic (Maria Bakalova). The snark and the
  story are artfully balanced. JS Live sport The Hundred Cricket, London Spirit
  v Oval Invincibles 2.30pm, BBC Two. The women’s game is followed by the men’s
  teams playing at 6pm.
