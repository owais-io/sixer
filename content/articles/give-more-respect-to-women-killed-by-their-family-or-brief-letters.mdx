  Re your article (Domestic violence screening tool should be replaced, Jess
  Phillips says, 26 August), can we please not use the word “honour” in the
  context of violent crimes against female family members, either as part of the
  Dash questionnaire used by police and social services or in new guidance for a
  legal definition of “honour-based” abuse. Call it what it is: family violence.
  The girls and young women mutilated and murdered deserve respect. Lynne
  Scrimshaw London • I was puzzled by your article (Activists hope to shift
  Venice film festival focus on to crisis in Gaza, 27 August). Why should the
  festival have to take a position on Palestine any more than on other tragic
  problems like Myanmar, Sudan or Tibet? It’s a film festival, not the UN. John
  Bowles Edinburgh • I’m guessing the gardeners whose veg crops have failed are
  online readers (Letters, 27 August). It was established long ago that lining
  your bean trench with physical newspapers helps with water retention. If I’m
  right, the Racing Post is especially good for runners. Pete Edmondson
  Butleigh, Somerset • Never mind early autumn fruit and conkers (Letters, 24
  August), there’s a fully decorated Christmas tree in a residential area of
  Edinburgh, with a nice rocking horse in the window to boot. Alex Dickie
  Edinburgh • Can politicians also desist from the annoying “I say to you”
  (Letters, 29 August). Who else are you saying it to? Barbara Riddell Epsom,
  Surrey • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please
  email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters
  section.
