  Emma Raducanu has underlined her excitement before what she describes as a
  “fact-finding match” against the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, as they prepare
  to battle in the third round of the Cincinnati Open on Monday. “It’s always
  exciting for a player like me to play the very top, because it’s like a
  fact-finding match,” Raducanu said. “You see where you are in comparison to
  the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day. You can lose two and
  one [6-2, 6-1] one day, you can win or you can make it close the next day, and
  it can be down to a few points. So I’m excited.” It will be Raducanu’s first
  significant match since starting work with her new coach, Francisco Roig, last
  week in Cincinnati. Last month she played one of her best matches against a
  top player in making life difficult for Sabalenka at Wimbledon in two tight
  sets. After serving for the first set and then later holding a set point
  against the Belarusian, Raducanu led 4-1 in the second set before losing 7-6
  (6), 6-4. “She played incredible tennis,” Sabalenka said of the British player
  after her straight-sets win against Marketa Vondrousova on Saturday night.
  “I’m super happy to see her mentally and physically back, and definitely gonna
  be back in the top 10 very soon. She challenged me that much, and I like to
  accept tough challenges, so I’m super excited about facing her on the hard
  courts.” Raducanu gave an honest response when asked if she left Centre Court
  at Wimbledon determined to have another crack at Sabalenka as soon as
  possible. “I would say I thought I’d love to have another crack at that on
  grass, like tomorrow,” she said, laughing. “But I know, and I’m honestly
  reasonable enough, and, I guess, honest enough in myself to know that
  different surfaces favour different people and where my game is at in
  comparison. I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage but we’ll see how
  it goes.” Raducanu has enjoyed a positive run of form in recent months while
  training and competing consistently on the tour and she could be seeded for
  the US Open. However, while she has performed well in the matches she has been
  favoured to win, the lessons from most of her previous encounters against the
  top players have been that her general level has simply not been good enough.
  In their first few days working together, Raducanu and Roig will at least get
  a clear understanding of exactly where she stands in comparison to the very
  best. On Sunday, Cameron Norrie struggled badly in 33C (91F) heat and humid
  conditions as he lost 6-4, 6-3 against Roberto Bautista Agut in the second
  round. After trailing the 37-year-old Spaniard by an early break, Norrie had
  appeared to be finding his way when he suddenly began to feel sick. Despite
  fighting hard until the end, he spent the rest of the match clutching his
  chest and barely able to move on the court: “[In the] 5-4 game I started to
  feel like I wanted to throw up,” said Norrie. “Maybe it’s the heat, I don’t
  know. I went to the bathroom and threw everything up after the first set and I
  was still not feeling good. And I had no energy in the second set.” Seeded
  32nd in Cincinnati, Norrie has been in great form over the past few months,
  following up his fourth round finish at the French Open with a quarter-final
  run at Wimbledon. Norrie had hoped to maintain his momentum on the North
  American hard courts, his favourite surface, but he has instead struggled in
  each tournament. Norrie’s physicality is usually one of his biggest strengths,
  which has made these results even more frustrating. “At this point, I don’t
  know what to say,” said Norrie. “We’re trying everything. We’re using the ice.
  We’re changing shirts and changing grips all the time. I don’t think it’s that
  hot, like it’s hot but it’s not crazy. I’m just not sure why my body is not
  letting me play. It must be mental too, because I’m really good in the heat,
  and I have such high expectations for myself to do well in the heat. So I
  guess maybe I need to lower those expectations now.” In his first match since
  losing in the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner last month, the men’s No 2 seed
  Carlos Alcaraz held firm in the decisive moments against Damir Dzumhur despite
  a turbulent performance to reach the third round in Cincinnati with a 6-1,
  2-6, 6-3 win. Coco Gauff, the women’s No 2 seed, eased into the third round
  with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Wang Xinyu.
