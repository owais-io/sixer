  European leaders including Keir Starmer will join Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a
  White House meeting with Donald Trump on Monday in an extraordinary joint
  effort to push back on a US-backed plan that would allow Russia to take
  further Ukrainian territory. As well as the UK prime minister, the French
  president, Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, Italy’s PM,
  Giorgia Meloni, and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, will all accompany
  Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the
  European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will also attend. The
  unprecedented show of support seems designed to prevent a repeat of the public
  mauling experienced by Zelenskyy during his last trip to the White House, in
  February, when Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, accused him of
  ingratitude and disrespect and told him: “You’re not in a good position. You
  don’t have the cards right now.” Trump, after his summit on Friday with
  Vladimir Putin in Alaska, has reportedly endorsed the Kremlin’s one-sided plan
  to end the war in Ukraine. It includes Kyiv giving up territory that Russia
  has been unable to seize and no ceasefire until a final deal has been agreed.
  Posting on Truth Social, Trump accused the media of misrepresenting his “great
  meeting in Alaska” – an encounter widely seen as a victory for Putin and a
  humiliation for the US president. On Sunday, Trump claimed he had made “big
  progress” on Russia, without giving details. European leaders on Monday will
  reaffirm their support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and argue against a
  land swap plan that rewards Russian aggression. They will also seek further
  clarity on what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of
  a settlement. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations
  in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agrees that any future Ukraine
  peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but added that
  Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security
  guarantees”. In a conciliatory statement announcing his visit to Washington,
  Starmer praised Trump for his “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in
  Ukraine”. At the same time, Starmer reasserted Europe’s red lines. He said the
  “path to peace” could not be decided without Zelenskyy and said Russia should
  be “squeezed” with further sanctions. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told
  CNN that Putin had agreed for the first time for the US and Europe to provide
  protection to Ukraine as part of a deal. This would be outside the auspices of
  Nato but would be the equivalent of the alliance’s article 5 self-defence
  pact, Witkoff indicated. Speaking in Brussels alongside von der Leyen,
  Zelenskyy rejected Putin’s latest demand for more land. The Russians want
  Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donetsk region, including a number of
  Ukrainian-controlled cities, as well as Luhansk province, which Moscow mostly
  occupies. Zelenskyy said Putin had been trying for 12 years to fully capture
  Donetsk oblast, without success. He said the current frontline should form the
  basis for negotiations, adding that territory could only be discussed in a
  three-way format with Kyiv at the table. A powerful Ukrainian army was the
  best security guarantee, he added. Starmer, Merz and Macron hosted a video
  call with European allies on Sunday before their Washington trip. “Ukraine
  must be a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders,” von der Leyen
  said, stressing there could be no Russian-mandated limits on Ukraine’s armed
  forces. According to the New York Times, Trump told European leaders he
  believed a peace deal could be negotiated if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the
  Donetsk region. They were unconvinced. The EU shares the Ukrainian view that
  Putin would use any new territory as a springboard for a further attack. Two
  sources with direct knowledge of the talks in Alaska told the Guardian that
  Putin had offered to freeze the frontline in southern Ukraine if he got
  Donbas. The plan would mean thousands of civilians would be forced to abandon
  their homes in key eastern cities such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which have
  withstood years of Russian attacks. Before Friday’s Alaska summit, Trump said
  he wanted an immediate ceasefire. Over the weekend, however, the US president
  endorsed Russia’s demand for a peace deal first and a truce second. Ceasefires
  “often times do not hold up”, Trump said in a social media post. Trump also
  appears to have dropped his threat of economic penalties on countries that buy
  Russian oil if Moscow refuses a deal. He has repeatedly threatened to impose
  secondary sanctions, setting various deadlines and failing to follow through
  when they expire. Trump on Sunday expressed his frustration at recent media
  coverage. “It’s incredible how the Fake News violently distorts the TRUTH when
  it comes to me,” he posted. “There is NOTHING I can say or do that would lead
  them to write or report honestly about me. I had a great meeting in Alaska on
  Biden’s stupid War, a war that should have never happened!!!” He added: “If I
  got Russia to give up Moscow as part of the Deal, the Fake News, and their
  PARTNER, the Radical Left Democrats, would say I made a terrible mistake and a
  very bad deal.” Speaking to the BBC, the former British defence secretary Ben
  Wallace described Trump’s apparent support for Putin’s demands as 1930s-style
  “appeasement”. He said the strategy – with pressure piled on Ukraine to agree
  – may save lives “in the short term” but in the long term “would probably put
  us at greater risk”. A joint statement issued by European leaders on Saturday
  said they were “ready to work with US President Trump and Ukrainian President
  Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support” but “it will be
  up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must
  not be changed by force.” They said they welcomed “President Trump’s efforts
  to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of aggression, and achieve
  just and lasting peace”. Zelenskyy said in a statement after his conversations
  with Trump and the European leaders: “The positions are clear. A real peace
  must be achieved, one that will be lasting, not just another pause between
  Russian invasions. Killings must stop as soon as possible, the fire must cease
  both on the battlefield and in the sky, as well as against our port
  infrastructure. All Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians must be released,
  and the children abducted by Russia must be returned.” Olga Tokariuk, a fellow
  at the Centre for European Policy Analysis, said Zelenskyy had a “difficult
  task” in Washington. He had to “demonstrate that Ukraine wants peace, but not
  at any cost, to ensure Ukraine still gets US support,” she said. At the same
  time he could not make concessions “unacceptable for Ukrainians”. Trump was
  unlikely to treat Zelenskyy with the “same friendliness as Putin”, she
  predicted. “The US under Trump is no longer willing to stand by its democratic
  allies, while instead it is embracing the tyrants,” she added. Additional
