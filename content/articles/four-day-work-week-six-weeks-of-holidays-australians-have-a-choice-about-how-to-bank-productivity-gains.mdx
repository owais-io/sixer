  to bank productivity gains

  One of the ideas that has captured many peoples’ attention amid the flurry of
  proposals ahead of the economic roundtable is the Australian Council of Trade
  Unions’ vision of a four-day working week. The peak union body argued that
  working less could actually be productivity enhancing, although the studies
  behind those claims aren’t too rigorous. While many Australians would
  certainly welcome a three-day weekend, Jim Chalmers has made it clear that
  working towards a national four-day working week is not on the government’s
  agenda, while reaffirming Labor’s commitment to flexible work. Employer groups
  have been scathing, and it’s not likely to be a big discussion point on day
  two of the three-day roundtable. Clearly not on board with the treasurer’s
  “open hearts and open minds” approach to this week’s talkfest, the Australian
  Industry Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, called the four-day working
  week idea “another populist, anti-productivity thought bubble”. Willox
  calculated that at the current dismal rate of productivity growth it would
  take 26 years to get to the point where we could drop a day’s work without
  going backwards economically. But as the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus,
  explained to the Conversation’s Michelle Grattan: the labour movement doesn’t
  expect a revolution in the working week to happen overnight. “To be clear, we
  weren’t asking for a change to the workplace laws for the government to do
  something,” McManus said. “We were raising this in the context of a discussion
  both around productivity and around AI as an important part of the
  distribution of the benefits of productivity growth or, for that matter,
  productivity growth out of less jobs, out of AI.” The longer arc of Australian
  history has been towards shorter working weeks and longer holidays. But that
  progress stopped a few decades back, settling on the current set-up of a
  38-hour full-time job, two-day weekend and four weeks’ paid leave. But there
  has been progress in other ways (assuming “progress” is working less – many
  believe hard work is an end in and of itself). For example, since the turn of
  the century, the share of full-time employed Australians who say they work
  longer than 50 hours weekly has gone from 25% to 15%. Meanwhile, part-time
  work has flourished, fed in particular by a surge in women entering the jobs
  market. (Which means households overall are probably working harder.) Since
  the turn of the century, the female employment to working-age population ratio
  has climbed from 50% to over 60%, according to data from the Australian Bureau
  of Statistics. (The equivalent workforce participation rate for men is just
  under 68% and hasn’t moved much over 25 years.) Of course, the working from
  home phenomenon that emerged with Covid has been a revolution for many,
  particularly working families. Thankfully, employers are on board and hybrid
  work looks set to stay. But to many Australians juggling work and other
  commitments, time still feels like the greatest luxury. In which case, why
  shouldn’t the reward for lifting productivity growth be fewer working hours
  for the same pay? Some fascinating research earlier this year by Rusha Das, an
  economist at the Productivity Commission, showed we would have a three-day
  working week today if we had collectively decided in 1980 to spend all the
  productivity gains of the following decades on leisure time instead of higher
  incomes. Das calculated that Australians used only a quarter of the
  productivity “dividend” from the past 40-plus years to work less, while we
  banked the remaining three-quarters as higher income. “We have largely traded
  it for higher incomes, and more and better stuff,” she said. One of the great
  things about a more efficient and dynamic economy is that it can give us more
  choices about what we want to do – how much more we want to buy, how much more
  we want to work and how much more we want to devote to family, hobbies or
  helping others. This may be getting ahead of ourselves – we have to raise our
  economic speed limit before we decide how much faster we want to drive. But
  we’d be mad to limit our thinking to the notion higher productivity is all
  about generating more income. The ACTU’s four-day work week proposal is a good
  reminder of that.
