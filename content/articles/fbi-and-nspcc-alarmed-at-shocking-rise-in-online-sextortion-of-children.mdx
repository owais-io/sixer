  Tech companies including Snapchat and Facebook reported more than 9,600 cases
  of adults grooming children online in the UK in just six months last year –
  the equivalent of about 400 a week. Law enforcement agencies, including the
  FBI and the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), have grown increasingly alarmed
  about the growing threat from sextortion and other crimes targeting teenagers.
  The US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) last
  year received 546,000 reports from tech firms of adults across the world
  soliciting children – a 192% increase from 2023. As many as 9,600 of these
  reports came from the UK in the first six months of 2024. Snapchat reported
  far more troubling material to NCMEC than any other platform in that period,
  its records show. The children’s charity, NSPCC, described the figures as
  “shocking” and said they were likely an underestimate. The NCA has launched
  what it called “unprecedented” campaigns in the UK to alert teachers, parents
  and children to the dangers of sextortion, in which victims are blackmailed
  into sharing abusive, explicit images. The NCA said: “Sextortion is a
  heartless crime, which can have devastating consequences for victims. Sadly,
  teenagers in the UK and around the world have taken their own lives because of
  it.” The NCMEC data is significant as it is based on reports from online
  platforms and internet providers – such as Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok –
  rather than victims, who can be reluctant to disclose the abuse. Tech firms
  are obliged under US law to flag suspicious material to NCMEC. The figures
  show that Snapchat reported about 20,000 instances of concerning material –
  including sextortion and child sexual abuse images – in the first half of last
  year. This is more than the combined number of reports from Facebook,
  Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly known as Twitter), Google and Discord. It is
  understood that Snapchat revised its policies for reporting this content last
  year and that as a result, subsequent figures will be lower. Rani Govender, of
  the NSPCC, said sextortion and other financially motivated sexual crimes had a
  “devastating” impact on youngsters, affecting their ability to trust or seek
  help and in some cases leading to suicide. NCMEC said it was aware of “more
  than three dozen” teenage boys worldwide who had killed themselves after
  falling victim to sextortion since 2021. Govender said some tech firms were
  “inadvertently turning a blind eye to the abuse occurring on their watch” by
  introducing protections such as end-to-end encryption, which make it harder to
  spot harmful content. Unlike some other platforms, Snapchat does not have
  end-to-end encryption on its text-based chats. Police forces are increasingly
  concerned that predators are turning to ever more sophisticated attempts to
  target children online. The Guardian has uncovered a 101-page manual giving
  detailed instructions on how best to exploit young internet users, including
  advice on the best phones, encryption, apps and alter egos to use. The dossier
  teaches users how to turn victims into “modern-day slaves” by acquiring
  explicit images before they then feel “compelled to comply with the
  extortionist’s demands”. The guide was allegedly produced by a 20-year-old man
  called Baron Martin from Arizona, US, who was arrested by the FBI in December
  and calls himself “the king of extortion”. Martin claims it has been “the
  catalyst for thousands of extortions”, according to the US Department of
  Justice. According to researchers, the sextortion manual was distributed on a
  number of “Com networks” – online communities where mostly young men share
  sadistic and misogynistic material and encourage each other to commit crimes.
  Milo Comerford, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) thinktank, said:
  “The continued accessibility of this kind of chillingly detailed sextortion
  guide points to the growing risk posed by toxic online communities that
  exploit and abuse children.” The FBI has identified scores of online gangs who
  collaborate to identify vulnerable victims before targeting them using a
  feigned romantic interest to obtain compromising photos. Those are then used
  to blackmail the victim to either provide further explicit images, self-harm,
  or carry out another act of violence or animal abuse. Comerford, of the ISD,
  said “robust multi-agency” safeguards were urgently required to build
  awareness of the risks of sextortion among young people, parents, guardians,
  teachers and others. He added: “These transnational networks are comprised of
  a constantly shifting landscape of groups that use social media platforms to
  identify, groom, and harm their victims, and in some cases engage in mass
  violence.” Snapchat and Facebook have been approached for comment.
