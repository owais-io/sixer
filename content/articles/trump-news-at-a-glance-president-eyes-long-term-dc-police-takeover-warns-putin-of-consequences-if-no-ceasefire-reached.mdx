  After deploying the national guard to the streets of the American capital,
  Donald Trump is now eyeing longer-term powers over authorities, saying on
  Wednesday that he is seeking to extend his temporary powers over Washington
  DC’s police department. Trump earlier this week invoked a never-before-used
  clause of the law that sets out the federal district’s governance structure to
  take temporary control of the police department, but will need Congress’s
  permission to extend it beyond the 30 days allowed under the statute. “We’re
  going to need a crime bill that we’re going to be putting in, and it’s going
  to pertain initially to DC,” Trump said. He alluded to other options for
  extending control of the police department, saying “if it’s a national
  emergency, we can do it without Congress”. Here are the key stories at a
  glance: Trump suggests other Democratic-led cities follow suit on crime
  legislation Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would ask Congress for
  “long-term” control of Washington DC’s police department and signaled he
  expected other Democratic-led cities to change their laws in response to his
  deployment of national guard troops and federal agents into the capital. The
  president’s comments came as the White House took credit for dozens of arrests
  overnight in Washington as part of Trump’s campaign to fight a “crime crisis”,
  which its leaders say does not exist. Read the full story Trump: Putin to face
  ‘severe consequences’ if he doesn’t agree ceasefire Vladimir Putin will face
  “very severe consequences” if he does not agree a ceasefire in the war in
  Ukraine at his summit with Donald Trump in Alaska, the US president said on
  Wednesday. Speaking after a call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European
  leaders, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Trump also suggested he would push
  for a second summit if his meeting with Putin goes well – this time including
  his Ukrainian counterpart. Read the full story Trump says he will host Kennedy
  Center awards Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will host the
  Kennedy Center honors this year and said he had been heavily involved in
  choosing who to nominate, rejecting people he thought were too liberal. Read

  revokes signature Biden order promoting economic competition Donald Trump on
  Wednesday revoked a 2021 executive order on promoting competition in the US
  economy issued by Joe Biden, the White House said. Biden signed a sweeping

  part of a broad push to rein in what his administration described as a pattern
  of corporate abuses, ranging from excessive airline fees to large mergers that
  raised costs for consumers. Read the full story What else happened today: A US
