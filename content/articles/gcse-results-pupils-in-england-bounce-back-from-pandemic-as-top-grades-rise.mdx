  Pupils in England who were thought to have been among the worst affected by
  Covid have bounced back in their GCSE results, with more achieving top grades
  despite the disruption of the pandemic. Fears had been raised that this cohort
  would be severely affected by having key stage 2 tests cancelled in the final
  year of primary school, when the pandemic hit in 2020, disrupting their
  transition to secondary school. However, the results published on Thursday
  showed 23% of entries for English 16-year-olds were awarded grades 7 or above,
  up from 22.6% last year, with boys improving their performance, though a
  higher proportion of girls continue to achieve top grades overall. In the key
  compulsory subjects of maths and English there were less encouraging signs,
  with the percentage of 16-year-old pupils achieving at least a grade 4 in
  English falling from 71.2% last year to 70.6%. In maths there was a slight
  decline, from 72% last year to 71.9% achieving grade 4 or better. Government
  policy in England means that teenagers who fail to gain at last a grade 4
  “standard pass” must undertake resits while they remain in formal education.
  But this year’s results revealed that fewer of those resitting were reaching
  grade 4 after multiple attempts, leading critics of the policy to label it a
  “crisis” that is damaging young people. For pupils in Northern Ireland, the
  proportion getting A and A* – equivalent to grades 7 and above in England –
  rose by a full percentage point to 31.4%, while the proportion getting grades
  C or above went up to 63.8%. In Wales, where letter grades are also still
  used, pupils getting the top grades rose to 20.1%, up from 19.8% in 2024, and
  those getting a C or better edged up by 0.3 percentage points to 63.8% this
  year. Jill Duffy, the chair of the Joint Council for Qualifications board of
  directors and chief executive of the OCR exam board, paid tribute to pupils’
  resilience: “Looking at these results, it is hard not to be impressed by
  students’ breadth of skills and knowledge.” The narrative of boys closing the
  attainment gap with girls, seen in A-level results last week, was also
  apparent in the GCSE results. Boys showed improved performances in some of the
  major subjects, while girls slipped backwards in their traditionally strong
  subjects such as English. The results mean that the gender gap in favour of
  girls is now the smallest since separate data for 16-year-olds in England was
  first published in 2016. In maths, 23.1% of entries from year 11 boys got
  grades 7 and above, a rise of 0.6 percentage points on last year, while girls
  slipped to 19.9%, widening the gap in top grades. In English the proportion of
  top grades awarded to girls slipped to 23.5% but boys improved by more than a
  full percentage point compared with 2024, from 14.5% to 15.6%. But the biggest
  sign that girls may have been most affected by Covid-era disruption was in the
  overall grade 4 and above awarded for English, which dropped from 77.1% to
  75.9%, while the 9-4 grades for boys ticked up to 65.5%. The proportion of
  girls who got a standard pass of 4 or better in maths also dropped, from 71.8%
  in 2024 to 71% this year. On the gender gap, Duffy said: “Since 2019, the gap
  between boys and girls in England achieving the top grade has shrunk by 1.5
  percentage points, and at grade 4 by almost three percentage points. At grade
  7 and above, boys are still five percentage points behind girls.” Regional
  inequalities in England, highlighted in the A-level results last week, are
  also evident in this year’s GCSE results, with the gap between the highest-
  and lowest-performing regions at grade 7 now at more than 10 percentage
  points. London is four percentage points above any other region, but the
  capital saw the biggest drop in performance at grade 4. There was good news in
  the north-east, which had the biggest improvement at this grade compared with
  2019 pre-pandemic figures. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary for
  England, said she was “absolutely determined” to reduce the attainment gaps
  between regions. Phillipson said: “Behind every grade lies hours of
  dedication, resilience and determination, and both students and teachers
  should feel an immense sense of pride in what they’ve achieved today. “But
  while results today are stable, once again we are seeing unacceptable gaps for
  young people in different parts of the country. Where a young person grows up
  should not determine what they go on to achieve.” Pepe Di’Iasio, the general
  secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:
  “Disadvantaged students were often those most severely affected by the
  disruption of Covid and that has made it even more difficult to close gaps in
  educational attainment caused by socioeconomic factors. “Those gaps are
  reflected in regional disparities evident once again in this year’s results.
  We simply must do more to invest – educationally, economically, and socially –
  in communities suffering from generational disadvantage.” Sir Ian Bauckham,
  the chief regulator at Ofqual, England’s qualifications watchdog, said:
  “Schools, colleges and employers can trust these results when making decisions
  that will shape these young people’s futures, while students can be confident
  that their achievements will open doors to educational and career
  opportunities.” More than 360,500 level 1 and 2 vocational and technical
  qualification (VTQ) results have also been awarded to pupils.
