  Australia’s youngest senator battled depression and bullying before her
  election, and has dealt with misogyny and Pauline Hanson since. Labor’s
  Charlotte Walker, a South Australian who turned 21 on election night,
  delivered her first speech on Monday night. She said when she was 18, she was
  trying to work out why she had trouble sleeping – but the truth was she was in
  denial about having depression. “The effects had been long lasting, compounded
  by guilt,” she said. “I often wondered if I wanted to go on – if there was any
  point in me being here.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Only a handful of
  people previously knew about her experience, she said, because she felt “deep
  shame” and was worried about “the perception of being damaged goods”. “During
  my term in parliament, I want to shine a light on how childhood experiences
  like mine can continue to affect your mental health into adulthood – and to
  explore meaningful ways to address this,” she said. And she said while people
  have accused her of being privileged because she went to a private school, her
  mum scraped together the money because she was being bullied so badly she was
  forced out of her local public school in year four. She said she will focus on
  issues such as the housing crisis and generational inequity, domestic
  violence, healthcare, youth mental health, climate change, regional
  opportunities and workers’ rights during her term. Young people, she said,
  “live with the ever-present threat of climate change”, from both current
  events such as fires, floods, and SA’s algal bloom, and from future scenarios.
  “In 2050 I won’t be in my late 90s, like some who want to abandon net zero,”
  she said. “My friends and I will be in our 40s, and we demand an inhabitable
  planet.” Walker also talked about the scourge of domestic violence, and
  pointed to findings by the SA royal commission into domestic, family and
  sexual violence, including that gen Z is the first generation to grow up
  exposed to violent pornography and misogyny online. She said while it was
  technically her first speech, it wasn’t the first time she has spoken in the
  chamber – and the results from previous outings have been “whack”. That may
  have been a reference to her feud with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson who
  referred to her as just being “out of her nappies”, after Walker criticised
  Hanson’s position against net zero. She has also copped misogynistic comments
  on social media, including on an Instagram reel that she was forced to remove
  anyway, because she’d breached parliament’s strict rules about where filming
  is allowed. On a lighter note, Walker said that her mother had suggested she
  tell parliament how she got her cat, Gerald. The story was that Walker and a
  friend “heroically” rescued two abandoned kittens they found in a national
  park, each keeping one. Only, that story wasn’t true. “I just really wanted a
  cat,” she said, adding that they got the kittens from a colleague. Addressing
  her mother, she said: “I only lied because I thought that if you knew the
  truth you’d make me take him back.” • In Australia, the crisis support service
