  In June, Sabrina Carpenter announced her seventh album, Man’s Best Friend; its
  artwork depicts Carpenter on her hands and knees, an unseen man grasping a
  handful of her hair. It instantly caused an uproar online – most notably among
  Carpenter’s young fans, who weren’t on Tumblr in 2015, or weren’t aware of the
  way the Sun newspaper wrote about Madonna every day of the 1990s and 2000s,
  and therefore didn’t realise that discourse around whether pop stars should or
  shouldn’t be allowed to sexualise themselves is older than pop music itself,
  and almost always inane. Anyone hitting play on Man’s Best Friend in search of
  another barrel-full of ragebait might be alarmed, not because it is
  particularly provocative, but because it is strangely old-fashioned. Carpenter
  is fond of blue turns of phrase (“Gave me his whole heart and I gave him
  head”), and the wordiness of her lyrics is indicative of someone who grew up
  in an era of constant stimulus. But Man’s Best Friend makes it clear that she
  regards pop music as a craft as much as it is an art. Few A-list albums
  released in recent years are as tightly stitched and locked-in as this one;
  played almost entirely with live instruments and packed with so many hooks
  that it feels as if it might burst at the seams, it seems a true creative
  arrival for Carpenter. The most significant provocation here may be a newly
  minted star, beloved by gen Z, going against industry orthodoxy and packing an
  album with unusual instruments, including clavinet, sitar and agogo, and
  making distinct allusions to Abba and Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk. To date, Carpenter
  has been known for hits such as Nonsense and Espresso, which largely succeeded
  off the back of solid hooks and whip-smart wordplay. Man’s Best Friend feels
  like a rejoinder to anyone who suggested Espresso was simplistic froth: these
  songs are disarmingly complex, almost weaselly in their ability to make
  intricate, unconventional structure sound effortless. Lead single Manchild is
  the kind of pop song that super-producer Max Martin might call “incorrect”:
  its second verse has a completely different melody than the first, which is
  different again from the bridge; the whole thing gallops along to a rumbling,
  country-fried groove and all the while Carpenter is rhyming things like “hard
  to get” and “incompetent” and trilling her way through the phrase “fuck my
  liiiiiiiife!” Carpenter’s music has always been smarter than she gets credit
  for, but Manchild is astounding in its construction and stickiness. It’s also
  a song that requires active listening. The first few times I heard it, I
  thought it was a dog’s breakfast, simply because it is so busy; it really only
  clicked for me after a few listens, when I had enough time to process all the
  seemingly counterintuitive moving parts. The same goes for My Man on
  Willpower, a lush Eurodisco song that pairs lyrics about sexual frustration
  and rejection with Boney M-esque schmaltz, and House Tour, which takes the
  quotidian brilliance of Diana Ross’s It’s My House to its natural extreme with
  the lyric “The couch is really comfy, comfy / Got some Chips Ahoy if you’re
  hungry?” Although there are sonic allusions to Abba across Man’s Best Friend,
  Carpenter and her collaborators – Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan –
  seem to have taken a kind of metaphysical lesson from the Swedes: even bubbly,
  daytime radio-friendly songs deserve to be treated with care and attention to
  detail. Carpenter’s main lyrical concern on this record is right there in the
  title – men treat the women they date like dogs – and she treats it with a
  lightheartedness that matches her tongue-in-cheek, Betty Boop-esque image. But
  these songs are expansive and durable in their execution: Antonoff drafted the
  members of his band Bleachers, in-demand session musicians in their own right,
  to play across these songs, and their presence elevates them greatly, turning
  stellar pop tracks into teeming productions you wish you could hear the
  individual stems of. We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night, about the kind of
  generically rocky relationship that many of my friends seem to be in, is a
  small scale epic, cresting with a grand guitar solo and skyward-soaring
  strings. After producing such a sustained run of records with the likes of
  Taylor Swift, Lorde, Lana Del Rey and many more, Antonoff seems to be persona
  non grata among pop fans right now who see him as overexposed and predictable,
  but Man’s Best Friend makes a strong case for his continued presence. He,
  Carpenter, Allen and Ryan work together like a finely tuned machine; Man’s
  Best Friend, to me, feels like a producer/artist pairing on par with his work
  with Del Rey on her instant-classic Norman Fucking Rockwell!. The tolerances
  between her writing and his production on this album are minuscule, and makes
  its predecessor, the solid Short’n’Sweet – which spent 49 weeks in the UK Top
  10 and produced three No 1 singles – sound practically rudimentary in
  comparison. The trade-off, when Carpenter is this much in the zone, is that
  everything about her music that rankles with people – the over-reliance on
  profane language, the overstuffing of songs with innuendo, the vaudevillian
  hamminess – is here in spades. That stuff could get tiresome across previous
  albums, but the difference on Man’s Best Friend is that everything else is so
  finely tuned, and so delightfully detailed, that it is easy to get over the
  occasionally lazy, internet-worn line (“I get wet at the thought of you /
  being a responsible guy”) or the fact that many of these songs cover
  noticeably similar ideas. Then again, there’s a Trojan horse quality to Man’s
  Best Friend: it’s so distinctly Carpenter that you might not even realise it’s
  one of the year’s singular, musically provocative pop records.
