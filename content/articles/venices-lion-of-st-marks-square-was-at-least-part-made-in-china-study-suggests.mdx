  The great bronze statue of a winged lion perched atop one of two granite
  columns in Venice’s St Mark’s Square has watched over the city for centuries.
  But Italian scientists have now found evidence to suggest the iconic statue
  was at least in part made in China, and possibly ended up in Venice via the
  Silk Road after being brought back by the father and uncle of the merchant and
  explorer Marco Polo. In research due to be published in the journal Antiquity,
  scientists from the University of Padua found that the copper ore used to cast
  the Venetian winged lion was mined in China’s Yangtze River basin. Advanced
  lead isotope analysis on samples of the lion showed that the copper used in
  its production originated from the lower Yangtze area in south-eastern China.
  “Lead isotopes provide a reliable means to link metals to their original ore
  deposits,” the scientists wrote. The research also suggests that the lion
  shares similarities with the kind of statue that might have guarded a tomb
  during the Tang Empire, which ruled China from AD 618 to 907. The scientists
  suggested the whole statue could have been brought to Venice after being
  encountered by Niccolò and Maffeo Polo during their visit to the Mongol court
  in Khanbaliq, now Beijing. Once in Venice, it was probably then modified to
  resemble the Republic’s emblem – the winged lion of St Mark. A visual
  examination of the statue showed that it used to have horns, which meant it
  most closely resembled a zhènmùshòu, a guardian lion that warded off evil
  spirits from graves during the Tang dynasty. It is believed the horns were
  later removed and ears shortened to adapt it more to the lion of Saint Mark.
  The symbol is omnipresent in Venice, featuring on buildings and coins. It is
  also the emblem of the Venice film festival’s top prize, the Golden Lion.
  However, little is known of the statue’s history. “We don’t know when the
  sculpture arrived in Venice, where it was reworked, who did it, or when it was
  erected on the column where it is still visible today,” said the study’s
  co-author Massimo Vidale. The scientists said their study did show the
  geographical reach of the Venetian Republic, one of the great trading powers
  of medieval Europe, and the interconnectedness of its world. Scholars have
  previously suggested that the sculpture hailed from Mesopotamia (present-day
  Iraq), ancient Persia or ancient Greece. “Venice is a city full of mysteries,
  but one has been solved: the Lion of Saint Mark is Chinese, and he walked the
  Silk Road,” Vidale said.
