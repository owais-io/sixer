  Bristol’s very cool Chandos Road area isn’t by any means a new food-lovers’
  hotspot. No, the stoves in this part of town have been bubbling away for
  decades – once upon a time, Keith Floyd, the original firestarter of the
  kitchen bad boys, held court on this very road. If you’re a young thing and
  blissfully unaware of our man Floyd, please avail yourself of the hundreds of
  YouTube clips out there and count the many moments when his wit, snark and, in
  many cases, boggle-eyed drunkenness would not be deemed fit in these
  modern-day puritan times. Floyd may be long gone, but the 21st-century Chandos
  Road is home to, among others, the well-loved Little Hollows Pasta Co and the
  much-lauded farm-to-fork Wilsons, and last autumn they were joined by Korean
  restuarant Dongnae, from husband-and-wife team Duncan Robertson and Kyu Jeong
  Jeon. The pair met at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon in Paris, moved on to run the
  now defunct L’Envie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending
  the best part of a decade in Jeon’s native Korea. In 2019, they settled in
  Bristol to open the very popular Bokman, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice
  and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.
  Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back,
  though. It’s billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant,
  but it’s actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London
  restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported
  chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its
  two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture,
  wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you
  are in a student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every
  night. In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke
  and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fat kkochi (skewers), assorted
  punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean
  beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable
  pond-green puddings – but more of that later. At lunch, there is an à la carte
  and a £24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of a hanjeongsik, an
  omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked
  flurry of Korean loveliness. Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring
  hit with Bristol’s diners. It may not be to everyone’s taste, especially if
  your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing
  scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce,
  all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old
  fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled
  monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf
  kimchi, and a very good raw sea bass mulhwe soup made with fresh sugar
  tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu,
  Dongnae’s staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference
  between your naengchae and your naengguk. Yes, yukhoe is like beef tartare,
  and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to
  be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come
  festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn’t, of
  course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture
  it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes
  of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generous ssam and sauces on
  the side. Dongnae is an ornate feast of sweet, sour, sharp, puzzling and
  powerful. It is little wonder that Bristol’s food scene is fighting for a
  table and feeling slightly irked that those tables now come with a limited
  time span. I didn’t really expect much from dessert, because on the face of it
  these people seem so very serious, but how foolish I was, because Jeon’s
  mugwort cake is one of the greatest things I’ve ever tasted. Yes, it looks
  like it ought to be dished up at a Harry Potter-themed tea party, and yes,
  it’s blue in places and algae-green in others, but the novelty ends the moment
  you bite into its complex, soft, creamy, buttery richness. Mugwort cake, it
  turns out, is the sponge cake it has taken me until my vintage years to
  discover, and now I pine for it daily. This higgledy-piggledy restaurant is
  causing a stir on Chandos Road, just as Floyd once did, but for very different
  reasons. Grab a seat if you can. Buckle up. Enjoy the ride. Dongnae 5-7
  Chandos Road, Redland, Bristol BS6, 0117 302 1034. Open Tues-Sat, lunch
  noon-3pm, dinner 5-11pm. From about £50 a head à la carte; set lunch £24;
  seven-course hanjeongsik tasting menu £65, all plus drinks and service The
  next episode of Grace’s Comfort Eating podcast is out on Tuesday 19 August –
