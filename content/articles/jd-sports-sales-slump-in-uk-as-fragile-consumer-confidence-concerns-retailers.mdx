  JD Sports has revealed a slump in UK sales, amid mounting concern that brittle
  consumer confidence will damage retailers. Revenues in established UK shops
  fell 6.6% as the leisurewear company struggled to beat strong trading last
  year, when it received a boost from the men’s Euro 2024 football tournament
  and women’s growing taste for sports footwear such as Adidas’s Samba and
  Gazelle. The company said it had invested in cutting prices online amid “tough
  comparatives”, especially on footwear for women and children. The sales slide
  in the UK in the 13 weeks to 2 August contributed to a 3% fall in underlying
  group sales in the period, with sales increasing only in the Asia Pacific
  region. Sales in the US fell 2.3%, although this was better than had been
  expected amid the impact of new import tariffs introduced by the Trump
  administration this year. Despite falling sales, shares in JD rose 5% on
  Wednesday morning, reflecting relief that the company confirmed it was still
  on track to produce full-year profits in line with expectations – although
  those have been downgraded in recent months. The company also announced a
  £100m share buyback. The poor UK sales for JD, however, are likely to increase
  fears of a tougher consumer environment, which hit retail share prices across
  the London stock market on Tuesday. Régis Schultz, the chief executive of the
  retail group, which operates the JD Sports fashion chain globally but also
  owns the Finish Line and Shoe Palace chains in the US, Sport Zone and Courir
  in mainland Europe, and Blacks and Go Outdoors in the UK, said: “Across our
  regions and fascias, in general we see a resilient consumer, albeit very
  selective on their purchases. We therefore remain cautious on the trading
  environment going into [the second half of the year].” He said there had been
  an “improved performance” in the US after several product launches were
  deferred into the second quarter and stronger sales trends in clothing and
  online. In mainland Europe and the UK he said there was “a good underlying
  performance” in clothing and newer footwear lines despite tough market
  conditions. In another sign of concern about the future for traditional UK
  retail, Frasers, whose brands include the Sports Direct chain and House of
  Fraser department stores, said it had added We Do Play, the operator of social
  leisure venues including the Flip Out trampolining indoor adventure parks and
  the crazy golf specialist Putt Putt Social, to its portfolio. Frasers’ chief
  acquisition officer, James France, said: “Today’s announcement marks a
  significant milestone in our strategy to diversify and create more dynamic
  consumer and leisure experiences.”
