  Morrissey has announced that he “has no choice” but to put up for sale the
  entirety of his business interests in the Smiths “to any interested
  party/investor”. The deal, made in apparent seriousness on his website,
  Morrissey Solo, in a post titled “A Soul for Sale”, would include the band’s
  name and artwork, which he created, as well as his share of merchandising
  rights, lyrical and musical compositions, synchronisation, recordings and
  publishing contractual rights. In a statement, Morrissey wrote that he was
  “burnt out by any and all connections” to his former bandmates, Johnny Marr,
  Mike Joyce and the late Andy Rourke. “I have had enough of malicious
  associations,” he continued. “With my entire life I have paid my rightful dues
  to these songs and these images. I would now like to live disassociated from
  those who wish me nothing but ill will and destruction, and this is the only
  resolution. “The songs are me – they are no one else – but they bring with
  them business communications that go to excessive lengths to create as much
  dread and spite year after year. I must now protect myself, especially my
  health.” Serious investors, Morrissey wrote, should email eaves7760@gmail.com
  to inquire. Morrissey shares 50% of the rights to the Smiths with Marr.
  Whether the brand retains its value to investors without Morrissey as an
  active participant to help market it remains to be seen. The Guardian has
  contacted representatives for Marr and Joyce for comment. It is unclear what
  annual business communications are being referred to by Morrissey. Joyce
  recently announced the publication of a “no-holds-barred” memoir, The Drums,
  this November. Johnny Marr has previously said that he declined an
  “eye-watering” offer for the Smiths to re-form. “It was a little bit about
  principles, but I’m not an idiot, I just think the vibe’s not right,” he said,
  referencing the evident political and personal differences between him and
  Morrissey. In 2024, Marr rubbished Morrissey’s claim that he had acquired the
  rights to the Smiths’ trademark “without any consultation”. Morrissey said
  that Marr owned the copyright which would allow the group to tour with a new
  vocalist. Marr said this was incorrect. A spokesperson said on his behalf: “In
  2018, following an attempt by a third party to use the Smiths’ name – and upon
  discovery that the trademark was not owned by the band – Marr reached out to
  Morrissey, via his representatives, to work together in protecting the Smiths’
  name. “A failure to respond led Marr to register the trademark himself. It was
  subsequently agreed with Morrissey’s lawyers that this trademark was held for
  the mutual benefit of Morrissey and Marr. “As a gesture of goodwill, in
  January 2024, Marr signed an assignment of joint ownership to Morrissey.
  Execution of this document still requires Morrissey to sign.” He denied that
  he was planning to tour under the Smiths name with a different singer, and had
  also turned down an offer from Warner Music Group to release a new Smiths
  compilation “given the number in existence”. Morrissey’s apparently dire
  situation may have been influenced by the evidently unsuccessful attempt to
  reform the Smiths, as well as the difficulties he has faced in releasing his
  14th solo album, Bonfire of Teenagers, which remains on the backburner. He has
  previously said he was “gagged” owing to the subject of its title track, the
  2017 terrorist attack on an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester that killed 22
  people. He has been performing the song since 2022. It features lyrics about
  how “The silly people sing Don’t Look Back in Anger / And the morons swing and
  say Don’t Look Back in Anger / I can assure you I will look back in anger ’til
  the day I die,” a reference to the street singalongs of the Oasis track after
  the bombing. The song concludes with Morrissey singing “go easy on the
  killer”. He was dropped by his former label BMG in November 2020 and blamed
  the split on the label’s “new plans for ‘diversity’”. At the time, BMG
  declined to comment on whether the decision had anything to do with the
  musician’s contentious statements about race and sexual assault. Bonfire of
  Teenagers has been completed since May 2021. His new deal with Capitol should
  have seen the album released in February 2023. However, at the end of 2022, he
  said he had “voluntarily” split from Capitol and his management team, and
  claimed that the label was “holding on to” the record. In April 2024, he said
  he had bought back the rights to the record but alleged that “every major
  label in London” had refused it “while also admitting that it is a
  masterpiece”. He has called the record “the best album of my life” and said
  the “madly insane efforts to silence the album are somehow indications of its
  power. Otherwise, who would bother to get so overheated about an inconspicuous
  recluse?”
