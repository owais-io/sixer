  Graham Potter accepted that he has to improve after West Ham’s dismal start to
  the season continued with a humiliating 5-1 defeat by Chelsea at the London
  Stadium. Potter, who is desperately looking to strengthen his struggling squad
  before the transfer window shuts, did not hide from the situation after his
  side followed up their 3-0 defeat by Sunderland in their opening game with
  another atrocious performance. The former Chelsea manager has made little
  impact since taking charge at West Ham in January and there is growing
  unhappiness behind the scenes. “You are under pressure all the time in these
  jobs,” Potter said. “In this situation, that is how it is. I know the
  territory, I know what comes with poor results and I accept that
  responsibility. It was too easy to score against us so I take my
  responsibility and I have to do better. That is the case with all the players.
  They are honest and want to do more than they are at the moment.” West Ham
  have conceded eight goals in their first two matches. Potter has criticised
  his players for failing to carry out the basics but he insisted that he has
  not detected a lack of effort. “I don’t want to say it’s a lack of fight, I
  know the players care and are desperate to do well,” he said. “I know they
  want to do better than we are. Sometimes in football and life you hit a patch
  and no doubt about it, it has been a tough week. We have had a smash on the
  nose.” Potter, who has picked up fewer points (nine) from his first 10 home
  games in the Premier League than any manager in West Ham’s history, did not
  want to say whether a relegation battle beckons. The club are hopeful of
  strengthening in midfield by signing Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa. Chelsea,
  meanwhile, delighted in how they dealt with losing Cole Palmer to a groin
  injury in the warm-up. They fell behind early but were inspired by a
  scintillating full debut from Estêvão Willian. “We conceded because of him, he
  lost the ball in the buildup, so he needs to make mistakes to learn,” Enzo
  Maresca said. “The performance was very good. That showed how good he is and
  the reason why he’s here with us.” Maresca added that Palmer has been dealing
  with a groin problem since last week.
