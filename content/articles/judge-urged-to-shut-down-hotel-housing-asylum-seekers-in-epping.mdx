  A high court judge has been asked to shut down a hotel housing asylum seekers
  amid concerns about violence and disorder seen at far-right protests at the
  site. The local council applied for an urgent injunction against the owners of
  the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, that would immediately prevent them from
  housing asylum seekers – having repeatedly called on the Home Office to close
  it down. A series of protests have occurred since an asylum seeker was charged
  with sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl in July. A second asylum seeker
  has since been charged with sexual assault. During a hearing before Mr Justice
  Eyre on Friday, Epping district council’s lawyer Philip Coppel KC said the
  site had ceased to be used as a hotel – its “sole lawful use”. This, he
  argued, was a “clear breach” of planning law. He also cited the concerns of
  local people, as well as the safety of the asylum seekers themselves among the
  justifications for an immediate ban. The hotel’s owners said the planning
  issue was central – and was insufficient to justify the “exceptional step” of
  an immediate interim injunction. It could be dealt with via conventional
  enforcement action or at a final injunction hearing, they argued. Piers
  Riley-Smith, representing Somani Hotels, said asylum seekers had been housed
  at the Bell for about a year and a half without issue – with problems only
  arising recently. He told the court: “In reality, this is an injunction by the
  council against the [recent] protests and the civil unrest. The council has
  targeted the wrong institution.” Coppel claimed the placement of asylum
  seekers put the local community at “enhanced risk”. He said the alleged sexual
  offences took place close to the hotel – and that there were schools with
  about 1,800 children in similar proximity. “Having this sort of thing go on,
  with such a concentration of schools, with no measures to stop a repetition is
  not acceptable. That risk needs to be removed … parents have the well-founded
  apprehension that the continued placement of asylum seekers at the Bell hotel
  represents a risk to those students.” Coppel said the asylum seekers
  themselves were not safe. “The occupants, some of whom are vulnerable, are
  being housed in circumstances that can be described as intimidating. It is the
  last thing they need.” Riley-Smith said his client believed local people’s
  concerns were genuine. He said: “It is clear recent protests have expanded far
  beyond the local community and have gone into concerns about wider ideological
  or political issues.” He argued that, if there were an urgent need to remove
  the asylum seekers and return the site to a conventional hotel because of
  fears about criminality, it would need to be shown the average asylum seeker
  had a greater propensity to commit crime than the average hotel guest. There
  was no such evidence, Riley-Smith told the court. Moreover, he said, were
  protests to be used as a reason to grant an urgent injunction against housing
  asylum seekers, this could be repeated at any place being used to welcome them
  across the country. Eyre reserved judgment until next Tuesday and ordered the
  hotel’s owners not to take in any new asylum seekers before then.
