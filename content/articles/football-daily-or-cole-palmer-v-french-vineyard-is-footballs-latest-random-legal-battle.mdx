  SOUR GRAPES Victoria Beckham taking on and losing against Peterborough United
  in a battle over the nickname “Posh”. Cristiano Ronaldo trademarking the
  combination of his initials and shirt number, “CR7”, to boost his brand.
  Kylian Mbappé nabbing the rights to his iconic crossed-arms goal celebration
  when it almost certainly would have been far more lucrative to seize ownership
  of that ubiquitously annoying “cry more” gif so beloved of dullards on several
  Social Media Disgraces. In a football business already swamped with cash and
  opportunists eager to get their mitts on as much of it as they can, it ought
  to come as no surprise that the very top players, clubs and Peterborough try
  to maximise their income by making their personal “brands” off limits to
  potential counterfeiters, bootleggers and other ne’er-do-wells. It seems a
  certain Cole “Cold” Palmer is the latest to get his legal team on the case,
  after it emerged the Chelsea midfielder (or more likely his Mr or Mrs 15%)
  instructed them to apply to trademark his famous “shivering” goal celebration
  and nickname. Quite apart from the fact that he nicked the former from a
  teammate and nobody calls him by the latter, Football Daily can’t possibly see
  Team Palmer hitting any snags when their case is considered by the
  Intellectual Property Office, who will decide whether to grant them the rights
  to hawk overpriced trainers, cologne, toys, drinks and other branded tat to
  gullible Chelsea and England fans. At least we couldn’t until we discovered a
  French winery had lobbed a £2,166 bottle of Château Palmer, 3ème Cru Classé
  into the works by blocking his application. Founded in 1814 when the British
  army officer, Charles Palmer, bought the vineyard from previous owner Madame
  Gasque and changed its name, Château Palmer has challenged young Cole’s bid to
  lend his name and image exclusively to alcoholic beverages, presumably on the
  grounds that they were flogging wine a full 139 years before he first
  showcased the celebration he appropriated from Morgan Rogers at Kenilworth
  Road. Lawyers at the IPO will now adjudicate after receiving legal
  representations from both sides and in the course of their deliberations may
  or may not chuckle at the irony of the fact that one particular drop sold by
  the French vineyard glories in the name Alter Ego. Billed as being “elegant
  and velvety with a wonderful capacity to age and evolve”, this fruit-driven
  and lively Margaux sounds identical to the footballer with whom Château Palmer
  are currently going to war. Rather than enter into conflict, a lucrative
  collaboration really ought to be on the cards. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE It’s a
  pwopa Lah’n derby this Friday night. Join Scott Murray for live Premier League
  updates from West Ham 0-0 Chelsea (8pm BST kick-off). QUOTE OF THE DAY I don’t
  want any players who don’t want to come to the club. If they don’t want to
  come here and wear this fantastic badge, we don’t want them here. That’s very
  clear, and I imagine the fans feel exactly the same” – Thomas Frank makes a
  gossamer-veiled reference to Eberechi Eze and also channels the spirit of
  teenage Football Daily, who was delighted to be dumped and didn’t want to go
  out with them anyway.  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS I was about to send you a witty
  email but got a better offer from a rival at the very last minute” – Nigel
  Sanders. It had passed me by that Everton had decided against a lucrative
  stadium sponsor and chosen to name their new ground after Benny Hill and David
  Dickinson. An odd combination but I’m sure they could do a better job for the
  Toffees up front than their current strikers” – Martyn Shapter. Following on
  from Noble Francis’s letter yesterday, might I suggest that a more appropriate
  shirt sponsor for Nottingham Forest could be the broadband providers who go by
  the name of Cuckoo?” – Paul Taverner. Regarding OGC Nice’s new third kit: I
  think it is a rather nice ‘clin d’oeil’ [wink – Google Translate Ed] towards
  their close neighbours 13km away. Imagine wearing a Robinhood sponsored kit in
  the principality of Monaco” – Yannick Woudstra. If you have any, please send
  letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’
  the day is … Martyn Shapter. Terms and conditions for our competitions, when
  we run them, can be viewed here.   MOVING THE GOALPOSTS  In the latest edition
  of our sister email, Eveliina Summanen gets her chat on with Suzanne Wrack
  about how she is backing Spurs to surge up the WSL table now they have a new
  manager in charge.  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join Max
  Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson,
  Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry
