  Americans are struggling financially, grappling with debt and the rising cost
  of living, and are blaming the Trump administration and corporate interests
  for worsening economic outlooks for working families, according to a new poll.
  Six out of 10 Americans place blame on the Trump administration for driving up
  their cost of living, according to a poll conducted by Morning Consult for the
  Century Foundation, which asked 2,007 Americans how they are managing the high
  cost of living in the US economy, who they think is to blame and what are the
  solutions. Sixty three per cent said Trump had had a negative impact on
  grocery prices, and 61% said he had had a negative impact on the cost of
  living. Nearly half, 49%, said the Trump administration had had a negative
  impact on their finances. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans, including 70% of
  Republicans, fear that Trump’s tariffs will increase the price of everyday
  goods. “Donald Trump has simultaneously raised prices on everyday goods
  through a reckless approach to tariffs, a decimation of programs that help
  Americans afford healthcare, education, food and childcare, and then
  kneecapping federal regulators who keep banks and other big businesses from
  swindling consumers,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of the Century
  Foundation. “This has created an alarming set of market conditions. Americans
  are left on their own to face high prices and low earnings, are building their
  own safety nets from a web of financial products, credit cards, buy now, pay
  later loans, payday loans and student debt, and companies have been given the
  green light to manipulate these products to boost their own profits without
  having to worry about following the law.” According to the poll, more than six
  out of 10 Americans said it had become more difficult to find a good paying
  job, buy a home and afford childcare. More than four out of five Americans,
  83%, said they were concerned about the cost of groceries, with 46% saying
  they were very concerned. Some 47% said they were worried about being able to
  pay their rent or mortgage, 64% said they were worried about affording an
  unexpected medical expense. About 48% said they believed they would have
  trouble affording an unexpected $500 bill without borrowing. One in four said
  it would be “very difficult”. A quarter of those surveyed said they spent at
  least three hours a day worrying about their finances and ability to afford
  basic necessities. Another 25% of respondents said they or someone in their
  household had skipped meals in the past year in order to make ends meet, and
  26% said they had fallen behind on their monthly bills over the past year.
  Americans also fear things are getting worse economically, with 76% of those
  polled saying they fear a looming economic recession. Corporations and
  billionaires were seen as a big factor behind this financial anxiety, with 51%
  saying they believe corporations have had an active role in making life more
  difficult for average people over the past 25 years, and 52% saying
  billionaires have made life tougher. Half of those polled also believe
  congressional Republicans have made life more difficult, with 41% believing
  Democrats have made life more difficult. “Millions of Americans, across
  parties, across backgrounds, are deeply anxious, and they’re struggling to
  afford basics like housing and health care. Donald Trump is making these
  struggles worse,” said Rachel West, senior fellow at the Century Foundation.
  “Americans believe the outsized influence of corporations and the wealthy has
  made their lives harder, and the risks they’re taking to cope with high costs
  like taking on debt and tapping into their savings should sound an alarm for
  policymakers.”
