  Over the past 12 months the rate of inflation was 2.1%, according to the
  latest consumer price index (CPI) figures from the Australian Bureau of
  Statistics. Change in prices is not uniform across Australia, and ABS data
  shows some capital cities are experiencing greater price rises than others,
  and some items are increasing in cost more quickly, or even decreasing. We’ve
  brought together all the data that goes into Australia’s headline inflation
  figures, broken down into the most detailed goods and services categories
  available. This uses the most recent figures, which are for the June 2025
  quarter. The data explorer shows the change in the price index, which is the
  cost of the item converted to 100 in a given base year, with each other year’s
  price presented in relation to the base year. For example, something that
  originally cost $3 in the base year but now costs $3.5 would show an index
  changing from 100 to 116. This makes the change in price comparable across
  different items and services. The interactive also shows percentage change in
  price, which compares the price for a given quarter to the quarter one year
  previous. According to the ABS, these categories were some of the biggest
  contributors to changes in the June 2025 quarter: Clothing and footwear
  Clothing and footwear increased by 2.6%, driven by an increase in the cost of
  garments (+3.5%) and footwear (+5.7%) due to “new season stock and items
  returning from sale price following new year promotional activity in the March
  quarter”. Health Medical and hospital services rose 2.3% following the annual
  increase in private health insurance premiums on 1 April 2025. Food The cost
  of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 1% over the quarter, primarily due
  to an increase in the cost of fruit and vegetables (+4.3%).
