  A former inmate has been found guilty of murdering a prison officer in a
  revenge killing, four years after saying “I promise I will get you.” Elias
  Morgan, 35, planned and carried out the shooting of Lenny Scott, a former HMP
  Altcourse prison officer who had discovered Morgan’s illicit mobile phone
  hidden behind bars in his cell. Scott was shot six times on 8 February 2024 in
  an “act of retaliation” after leaving a gym in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, four
  years after the row with Morgan in March 2020 over the mobile phone, which
  exposed the inmate’s affair with a female prison guard. Morgan offered Scott
  £1,500 to get rid of the phone and when that did not succeed, Preston crown
  court heard, he turned to threats, warning him: “I’ll bide my time but I
  promise I will get you.” Morgan also made a gun gesture with his fingers. Four
  years later, he shot the father of three, who had since left the Prison
  Service, six times in his head and body before fleeing the scene on an
  electric bike. Evidence presented by the prosecution showed that Morgan
  scouted out places he believed the victim could be in Merseyside, where they
  both lived, and in Lancashire as he planned the “cold-blooded” murder upon
  leaving prison after completing his sentence for drugs offences. Morgan was
  due to stand trial for possessing the phone 11 days after the shooting. In
  2020, in the aftermath of the altercation over the phone, Scott had reported
  multiple threats from Morgan to the police. Jurors were played a recording of
  a 101 call from the prison officer who said he was worried about his family
  when Morgan had described his home, his partner and his children “to a T”. He
  told the operator: “He said he’s got lads everywhere, he’s described my
  vehicle and he’s described my house and what my girlfriend and twin boys look
  like.” Scott said he had been threatened in the past but these threats were,
  as the operator suggested, “too close to home”. Wendy Logan, the deputy head
  of the Crown Prosecution Service north west complex casework unit, said:
  “Lenny Scott was a devoted father who had bravely upheld his duty when working
  as a prison officer by reporting an illicit phone he found in Elias Morgan’s
  cell in 2020. He did so in the face of attempts at bribery and also threats
  and intimidation by Morgan, and his commitment to public service will not be
  forgotten. “Morgan – driven by revenge and believing he was above the law –
  carried out a cold-blooded murder. We were determined to deliver justice and
  see Morgan brought to book for his evil crime, and our case set out in clear
  terms how he planned and carried out his callous act. “Our thoughts remain
  with Lenny’s family – particularly his three young children – and all those
  who cared for him, as they deal with his loss.” A second defendant, Anthony
  Cleary, was cleared of charges in relation to the murder. Morgan will be
  sentenced on 2 September.
