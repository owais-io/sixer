  football’

  Dilma Mendes’s contribution to football has been significant. She is the coach
  responsible for identifying and honing the talent of Formiga, one of Brazil’s
  most emblematic female footballers. Mendes trained the player from the age of
  nine until her professional career began at 16. Now, more than 30 years later,
  they are working together again, to bring the Football 7 World Championship
  title to Brazil. The international tournament takes place in Curitiba, in the
  south of Brazil, from 21-24 August. Mendes, twice voted the best women’s
  seven-a-side coach in the world, has called up the 47-year-old Formiga to lead
  the fight for a second world title, and Formiga’s wife, the former player
  Érica de Jesus, will be assistant coach. Mendes’s career with the national
  seven-a-side outfit began in 2019, when she was hired to develop a new team,
  and she searched all corners of Brazil to identify players. In 2023, when the
  men announced the futsal legend Falcão would play for them, the women brought
  in Formiga. “I reached out to Formiga and told her we needed her as a
  legendary player,” Mendes says. “I truly believe in this sport because we have
  seen events growing more and more, even big tournaments like The Soccer
  Tournament, for example. We see players who have a history in other kinds of
  football, but we also see new generations who can become stars of the game in
  their country.” Formiga, who played 234 times for Brazil’s 11-a-side team,
  including at seven World Cups and seven Olympic Games, calls Mendes her
  “second mother”. Mendes would take Formiga to every tournament her team
  played, even if she was too young to participate . “I think life chose Formiga
  for me, as much as I chose her,” Mendes says. “I always say that love found
  both of us – the love we have for football. I met Formiga when she was nine,
  playing in the neighbourhood, barefoot among adult men. I even wondered if she
  was a boy or a girl. I shared her custody, so to speak, with her mother,
  Celeste, until she was 12. Then, we decided she needed a change and she moved
  in with me. I left my flat and rented a place for me and 11 girls, which we
  called Athlete’s Home.” Living and training with women helped Formiga develop
  her style. When she was 16, a group representing the women’s national
  11-a-side team saw Formiga playing futsal and gave her a Brazil call-up. Her
  international career would span 26 years. When Formiga was called up as a
  forward, Mendes fought for her to play as a defensive midfielder. “I’d seen
  her playing against grown men, fighting for the ball, at just nine years old.
  I knew she would be great at that – and also, Brazil has always had many
  forwards but needed more people who could play defensively. It worked out for
  the best.” Mendes’s path in football began in her home town of Camaçari, in
  the countryside of Bahia. However, during childhood, it was illegal for women
  to play football. She would play with boys in the neighbourhood, paying them
  in ice-cream to warn her if the police or her mother were around. The ban was
  lifted in 1979 – until then, she would be detained and sometimes scolded if
  caught playing. “The police would arrest me but couldn’t keep me for long
  because it was a small town – they couldn’t keep me in a cell for playing
  football. But they would sit me down and wait for one of my parents to come
  and pick me up. I always hoped it was my dad, because he would cover for me,
  but my mum would scold me. She thought I was just being a rebel, but I played
  football out of love.” Mendes has been appointed sports secretary in Camaçari
  and works with several social projects teaching football to girls in the
  state. Formiga followed in her footsteps and became sports secretary in the
  city of Cotia, in the countryside of São Paulo, working with Mendes to develop
  a strategy for women’s football teams around the state. Mendes has also worked
  as a curator in the new permanent exhibit at the Football Museum in São Paulo,
  sharing part of her archives about women’s football in Bahia and around
  Brazil, with pictures and stories. She regularly meets fellow women’s football
  pioneers to study and discuss the game, their lives and shared experiences.
  “As Black women, we need to not only have the knowledge but also be able to
  strategise in order to get into the game without changing who we are,” she
  says. “Ever since I was a kid, I knew that if I wanted to play football, I
  needed to learn the fundamentals – keepy-uppies, control, balance … I believe
  that as a coach, I have to study even more.” Her experience with futsal led
  her to better understand how to play in tight spaces and take advantage of
  every shot. Mendes has big dreams and is developing a study of women’s
  football teams around Bahia to understand where the game needs more support.
  “If you have 20 girls in a social project, for example, they will need
  support. One of them might be a future Formiga, a future Marta, Roseli,
  Pretinha … We need to think about the 2027 Fifa Women’s World Cup as an
  opportunity for legacy and public policy, but always questioning who is
  benefiting from it. “We need to create laws to protect the game, because when
  I was a kid, there was a law that tried to keep me from playing. I think our
  own existence as players and as people who want to develop the women’s game in
  Brazil show why this study matters. Otherwise, the stakeholders will be
  talking about us without us having a seat at the table.” Get in touch If you
