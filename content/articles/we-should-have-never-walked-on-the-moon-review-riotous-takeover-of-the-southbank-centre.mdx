  We Should Have Never Walked on the Moon review – riotous takeover of the
  Southbank Centre

  A black stretch limo is parked beside the Thames. Blank-faced characters,
  dressed as if walking home from the night before, repeatedly spray-paint
  slogans on the pavement (“Tomorrow is cancelled”) before they’re wiped away. A
  film of a staged riot gives La Haine vibes. Political impotence cast through a
  bleak filter – that’s the intro to a takeover of the whole Southbank Centre by
  French dance collective (La)Horde. It puts films and live performances by a
  cast of 80 (with dancers from Ballet National de Marseille and Rambert) all
  over the complex’s buildings for a buzzing three hours. That’s as overtly
  political as it gets, though, because in (La)Horde’s world, everyone is too
  distracted by screens to engage, including a guy who walks around with a rig
  holding 40 phones, like a tourist with an elaborate selfie stick. In one piece
  called Deep Stream, the dancers, like avatars, go through the human motions,
  but it’s all fake laughter and glazed gazes. Across a lot of these
  performances, the mood is of eerie disconnect, joyless sex, aloofness,
  sadness. Is anyone happy in (La)Horde’s world? It’s a troubling depiction of
  gen Z. (The finale, though, offers a blast of primal energy that’s a thrilling
  tonic.) (La)Horde excel at reframing or repurposing street and social dance,
  as in guest choreographers Cecilia Bengolea and François Chaignaud’s Grime
  Ballet, where dirty bass is unexpectedly paired with the clean pink satin of
  pointe shoes. Or the techno lindy hop of Hop(e)storm, swing dancing to a
  strict beat. They strip a dance of one context and give it another in a way
  that’s simple and readable but also strange and compelling. In To Da Bone,
  they bring together “jumpstyle” dancers, bedroom amateurs from around Europe
  who dance like they’re doing football tricks with an invisible ball. It’s very
  specific, very technical, and treated with the seriousness of a ballet petit
  allegro. It also reminds you of step dances from Ireland, South Africa and
  Chicago and the way such ideas were spread or developed long before digital
  memes. The evening’s format, of short pieces you dip in and out of, echoes
  online life. All the artists need to offer is a tasty bite, a novelty, a
  sensation, and you can walk away before anything gets too demanding or boring.
  That’s shallow, you could say, but it’s also exciting, and the event embodies
  the questions it’s asking in a way that’s genuinely meaningful. • At Southbank
  Centre, London, until 6 September
