  A reshuffle on the Monday morning before parliament returned from recess had
  been long rumoured, but many in Westminster had expected a shake-up of junior
  ministers rather than Downing Street. Staff in No 10 were gathered in awkward
  silence at 9.30am in the Pillared Room to wait for the prime minister to
  explain the changes, many of whom had thus far only read about them online.
  The departures and new hires are expected to signal a new understanding about
  the need for experienced hands in government and to give Keir Starmer more
  direct oversight over the delivery of key government priorities, especially on
  the economy. But some of the hires – particularly those from the Tony Blair
  era – have already proved controversial. Who’s in? Darren Jones Chief
  secretary to the prime minister Starmer has poached Jones, in effect Rachel
  Reeves’s deputy, for the newly created post of chief secretary to the prime
  minister. A reliable communicator and a willing attack dog, Jones is expected
  to do lots of media for the PM on the government’s message and delivery, and
  to take on the threat from Reform. Regarded as hardline on the economy, Jones
  was Reeves’s firewall in tense negotiations with cabinet ministers over the
  spending review. But he is also a loud progressive, having called for Labour
  to be the party of “love, compassion and community” to face off against Nigel
  Farage’s politics of “anger, division and blame”. Tim Allan Executive director
  of communications The most controversial appointment of the shake-up, Allan is
  a veteran spinner from the Blair government and the founder of the PR
  mega-agency Portland. An extremely experienced communications specialist, his
  appointment is part of what one senior staffer told colleagues was more
  “grownups” returning to government – although that description has raised
  hackles internally. Some special advisers are very concerned about Portland’s
  previous links to lobbying for the governments of Kazakhstan, Russia and Qatar
  – including for the controversial 2022 World Cup – and believe it will be a
  major issue for the government. Allan left the firm in 2019. Portland stopped
  lobbying on behalf of Russia in 2014. Most of Allan’s past colleagues describe
  him as charming and collegiate. He will be well on the right of the party.
  Steve Richards, the former Labour adviser, recalled Allan’s No 10 leaving do
  20 years ago where Blair teased that he was “even more rightwing than me”.
  Minouche Shafik Chief economic adviser Said to have been Starmer’s choice for
  cabinet secretary, the former Bank of England deputy governor has finally been
  lured to Downing Street to add much-needed economic heft to the operation.
  Shafik had a controversial tenure at Columbia University over pro-Gaza
  protests that eventually forced her resignation, but in No 10 she will be back
  in her specialism and she has held a major Whitehall role before as permanent
  secretary at the Department for International Development. Along with Jones
  and Starmer’s new private secretary, Daniel York-Smith, who comes from the
  Treasury, Shafik’s appointment signals Starmer is clearly tooling up for big
  battles to come on the economy. Morgan McSweeney Prime minister’s chief of
  staff McSweeney remains the most powerful member of the prime minister’s inner
  circle, his most trusted adviser and the man he credits for the sweeping
  election victory. But those close to McSweeney admit that his skill is
  strategy and politics rather than delivery and policy, and they say there has
  been a major need to bolster the operation with experts in driving through
  delivery of radical change. McSweeney and his team – as well as Starmer
  himself – have been privately extremely frustrated with the pace of change in
  Whitehall since Labour came to office, and part of the shake-up is giving the
  prime minister more direct oversight of delivery. Steph Driver Director of
  communications Driver has long been Starmer’s most trusted adviser on
  communications and is well liked across all of Whitehall’s special advisers.
  There is a some discomfort especially among female advisers that Allan appears
  to have been promoted over Driver, when she had previously shared the role
  with James Lyons, who is leaving the government. Driver, who never left
  Starmer’s side during the election campaign and was responsible for briefing
  the prime minister, is still likely to remain the day-to-day communications
  frontline. “As far as the rest of government is concerned, Steph Driver will
  continue to lead comms,” one adviser said. Stuart Ingham Outgoing policy chief
  becoming senior counsel to the PM and director of strategic interventions
  Ingham is Starmer’s longest-serving adviser, having joined for his leadership
  bid and led the party’s policy team in opposition. He is extremely close to
  his boss and has survived numerous attempts by newcomers to oust him. He will
  move to the political team, headed by McSweeney, which also includes the
  director of political strategy, Paul Ovenden. “Stuart will be freed from
  managing the team and will be advising him directly,” one source said. “Keir
  is keeping the people he trusts close.” Vidhya Alakeson Deputy chief of staff
  Alakeson is said to be the mastermind behind the No 10 shake-up, in
  consultation with the Whitehall fixer and Starmer confidante Louise Casey. The
  changes at the top are said in part to have been prompted by the success of
  hiring Jonathan Powell, the former Blair chief of staff, who has been
  Starmer’s foreign policy adviser and a much-needed experienced hand in the
  sometimes chaotic first year in power for Labour. Alakeson will take on the
  expanded and additional responsibilities for policy and delivery alongside Nin
  Pandit, who had been the prime minister’s private secretary. However, a new
  policy unit director is expected to be appointed in the coming months. Louise
  Casey Informal strategic adviser It had been long rumoured that Starmer had
  hoped to appoint Lady Casey to a permanent role in his team, or even as a
  minister. She has long been an informal adviser and was with him on election
  night. Casey has a formidable reputation for her inquiries undertaken on
  behalf of numerous governments, on subjects from grooming gangs to racism in
  the Metropolitan police. But instead she has taken on the brief of outlining a
  new social care system – not expected to report back for two years or more.
  Casey is said to have been providing advice on how Starmer can better
  structure No 10, including the idea of a chief secretary. Who’s out? James
  Lyons Director of strategic communications The former Daily Mirror and Sunday
  Times journalist came to No 10 after a successful comms career with the NHS
  and TikTok. He replaced Matthew Doyle, who had the role for years in
  opposition. He departs after less than a year, after a summer in which Nigel
  Farage grabbed at least 22 front pages, with very little to show from the
  government. Liz Lloyd Director of policy, delivery and innovation Lloyd will
  leave for another role in government after months in No 10 where her focus was
  delivery. Lloyd had been Blair’s deputy chief of staff but clashed with the
  soft-left thinktank graduates in the policy unit, including Ingham. Insiders
  complained that it had long been unclear who was fully in charge of policy –
  Ingham or Lloyd. Olaf Henricson-Bell Director of the No 10 policy unit A
  senior civil servant, Henricson-Bell will stay in government but is expected
  to move to a new role, having previously been at the Treasury. Henricson-Bell
  is the twin brother of Torsten Bell, the pensions minister, and it has been a
  long-running Westminster joke that the twins could one day end up running the
  Treasury as chancellor and permanent secretary.
