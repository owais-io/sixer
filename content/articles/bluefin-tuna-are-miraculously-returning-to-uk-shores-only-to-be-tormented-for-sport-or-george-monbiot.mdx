  It’s the UK equivalent of bullfighting. Next week, in Falmouth in Cornwall,
  anglers will compete to fish for bluefin tuna in a three-day tournament.
  Sponsored by companies including Suzuki and Shimano, it’s a festival of
  cruelty and destruction, waging war on a magnificent giant which, in a rare
  instance of ecological hope, has begun returning to our shores. Where’s the
  sport in this “sportfishing”? While some forms of angling require knowledge
  and skill, in this case the paying customer (the angler) sits in a boat while
  the professional skipper motors up and down, trailing a set of lures. When a
  tuna is hooked, the angler, strapped into a harness, either stands or sits in
  what is called the “fighting chair” and “plays” the fish to exhaustion: a
  one-sided fight of 30 minutes or more. It’s a risk-free means of pitting
  yourself against nature, a truly pathetic form of macho gratification. You can
  imagine my surprise on discovering that Nigel Farage is a big fan. Among the
  plastic warriors looking for an IRL game they can play from a chair,
  recreational tuna fishing is booming. While in 2024, 93 licences were granted
  to charter boats and private boats catering for the market, this year the
  government has issued as many as 180. Obviously, the decision is backed by the
  best possible science, informed by knowledge of populations and of what
  happens to the fish after they are released … Sorry – went off on one there.
  Obviously not. The government tells me “there are no estimates of the number
  of bluefin tuna in UK waters”. There is also a dearth of studies on what
  happens to tuna once they have been caught and released, and none assessing
  the impacts of real-world tuna angling in the UK. The best we have is an
  Australian study of real angling conditions, which reports a bluefin survival
  rate of 83%: in other words, 17% die. The marine ecologist Dr Richard Kirby
  says mortality in real conditions “is likely to be higher than that seen when
  bluefin tuna are caught under scientific conditions where the post-release
  survival of the animal is crucial to the research”. Alongside a study
  conducted in circumstances far removed from the macho feeding frenzy we see in
  the videos posted by anglers and charter companies, the UK government relies
  on skippers reporting fish that die beside the boat. There’s an obvious
  incentive to undercount. But rest assured: a paper for the government tells us
  “charter vessel interviewees reported no issues with their own reporting”. The
  great majority of deaths are likely to occur after release. Bluefin tuna are
  partially warm-blooded fish that overheat when forced into sustained flight.
  After a certain time on the hook, oxygen loss kills their muscle cells. They
  need to cool down as rapidly as possible once released, by diving deep, where
  the water is colder. This is why the partnership set up by the government,
  Thunnus UK, states that “care should be taken not to release tuna in water
  shallower than 50m”. But the code of conduct agreed between the government and
  the recreational fishing lobby, the Angling Trust, specifies just 40 metres.
  Could this be because few of the inshore locations where tuna are caught in
  the UK are 50 metres deep? Even 50 might be too shallow: a study off Ireland
  found tuna immediately diving up to 80 metres after release. Skippers
  routinely break even this feeble code. I have watched recreational tuna boats
  fishing in the midst of great shoals of tuna within 100 metres of the shore,
  where the water is just 15 metres deep. The Falmouth tournament organisers
  claim that “the welfare of the fish is of paramount importance”. If so, that
  will be a radical break from common tuna-angling practice. On Facebook and
  Instagram, you can watch videos of men going mad on testosterone once they
  hook a fish, while the code of conduct walks the plank. Charter companies
  boast of two or even three anglers playing fish at once, though the code says
  “multiple hook-ups have been shown to risk an increase in mortality … Upon
  hook-up immediately remove other tackle from the water.” As one boat owner
  remarks, while bragging about a triple hook-up, “the carnage continues”. I
  have seen videos in which two-hooked lures are used: the code says they should
  not be deployed “under any circumstances”. Anglers should “keep fight time to
  a minimum”, as an hour or more “may compromise” survival rates. Yet we see
  them crowing about playing fish for 90 minutes. The code says “conventional
  gaffs [long hooks used to pierce the fish and hold it alongside the boat]
  should not be used”, but this is also ignored. On a podcast a few months ago,
  a charter boat skipper states: “I’ve seen loads of release shots on social
  media this year with fish going back.” His reaction? “They’re fucked.” Fishing
  News reports that for the first time last year, trawlers started pulling up
  “dead bluefin, some in an advanced state of decomposition … It is highly
  likely that this is linked to the expansion of the charter angling fishery in
  2024.” Until recently, I thought the recreational fishery might become a lobby
  for the tuna’s protection against commercial fishing. What we see instead is a
  Klondike rush to profit from the male-inadequacy market. The renowned Cornish
  fisher Andrew Pascoe, who supports recreational angling in principle, says he
  has noticed some charter boats have started competing over who can catch the
  most in a day. “That for me was the beginning of the end … you can’t possibly
  revive the fish properly and catch 18 fish in a day.” Private boats (ie, those
  not for hire), he says, are the biggest problem. Some have no idea how to
  handle the fish, which break free, trailing lures, lines and spreader bars: a
  death sentence. A different industry could be developed, employing local
  people and generating income: tuna watching. It could be a massive attraction
  for tourists, photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. I have stood many times
  at a point on the coast where these vast fish leap from the water, catching
  garfish, sometimes in mid-air. It’s one of the greatest and most reliable
  natural spectacles on Earth. Who would not wish to be taken out on a boat to
  watch this marvel at close hand? I believe that all megafauna, bluefin tuna
  included, should be treated like whales and dolphins: as animals we no longer
  hunt or kill. Given that tuna fishing here is still in its infancy, which
  means the political costs of stopping it remain small, we could create a
  sanctuary in UK waters for a marvellous species pursued everywhere else. Could
  we, just for once, get something right? George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist
