  The measure of a political party’s failure lies not in how many agnostics and
  opponents it fails to convert, but in how many loyalists it fails to preserve.
  The endorsement of new, unnatural voters – Latinos in the US for Donald Trump,
  or Tories voting for Labour for the first time – might deliver big electoral
  swings but is ultimately not sticky. And these votes are only meaningful if
  the bedrock is solid. That bedrock is the people who consistently show up, no
  matter what, from generation to generation, for a party. And the Democrats are
  losing them. In extensive research published last week tracking voter
  registration, the New York Times identified an alarming pattern. The
  Democratic party has been “haemorrhaging” voters since way before election
  day. In the states that track voter registration by political party, Democrats
  lost to Republicans in all of them in the years between 2020 and 2024. By the
  time Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, the party had already shed more
  than 2m votes in those states, and Republicans had gained 2.4m. This is part
  of a “four-year swing” that amounts to 4.5m votes. In a chilling conclusion,
  the report states that “few measurements reflect the luster of a political
  party’s brand more clearly than the choice by voters to identify with it”. The
  signs get worse the more closely you look. It’s not just a decline in new
  registered voters, but a hacking away of those natural voters who parties can
  easily rely on. Some of the sharpest declines were among young voters who came
  out emphatically for Joe Biden in 2020, then swung towards Trump in 2024. An
  assumption that voters who are young, Black or Latino would register mostly in
  the Democrats’ favour was no longer safe. The most striking thing about these
  revelations is how long and consistent the turn-off has been: “There is no
  silver lining or cavalry coming across the hill,” said one voter registration
  analyst, “this is month after month, year after year.” They show how during
  the last election, when the Democrats were battling with the damage of a
  belated handover from Biden to Harris, and a swirl of other challenges, the
  party was already on the back foot, hostage to a years-long disillusionment.
  And if you look at some of the reasoning for Democrat abandonment from last
  year, the same conclusion heaves into view – the Democrats rested on their
  laurels, and Trump attacked. The vibe contest was between business as usual,
  and the promise of something different. The result is a cratering of Democrat
  support that cannot be filled in overnight, or even over the next three years,
  especially with the party seemingly in disarray, and with a lo-fi leadership
  in Chuck Schumer accused of being “unwilling and unable to meet the moment”.
  It’s not about the unique, mendacious bewitching of voters by Trump, but
  something broader. Centre-left parties seem trapped by their inability and
  unwillingness to articulate values in ways that go beyond just saying the
  other guys are bad for democracy, by identifying a vision of what and who they
  are for. They are operating in a world where traditional coalitions around
  class, labour and identity are dissolving, where high barriers to home
  ownership, social mobility and job stability have been erected, and the
  relationship between hard work and prosperity, or even viability, has been
  severed. Combine that with an online and media ecosystem that trades in
  attention and feeling, and you have a political climate that requires policy
  intervention and campaigning edge. Instead, as summed up by Gabriel Winant
  after Trump’s victory, Kamala Harris had “stretched her coalition into
  incoherence” in a “grab bag” of policies “sharing no clear thematic unity or
  coherence”. This is the result of both a lack of direction, and of a party
  that now houses both the powerful and those at the losing end of that power,
  which can only mean a lop-sided capture by the former. Or, as chillingly
  observed by Anton Jäger: “Bankers and warmongers predominate in Democrat
  ruling circles, the indebted and the marginalised among its rank-and-file.”
  This reminds me of Keir Starmer’s drive to cast Labour as “pro-business,
  pro-worker and pro-wealth creation”. You cannot have coherence when the
  interests you represent, or claim to represent, are by definition
  antagonistic. This brand tension has an analogue in a smaller but no less
  revealing way in the UK, where students are abandoning Labour. University
  Labour clubs are disaffiliating from the party, Labour’s youth membership has
  collapsed, the tail of a longer falling out with Labour leadership over Gaza.
  But this is a broader confrontation between young voters and a party that has
  failed to stand for any clear moral principles that appeal to the idealism so
  necessary to create not only future voters, but activists and campaigners. On
  Gaza, Labour is anti-starvation, but also anti-protest. And both the Democrats
  and Labour are positioning themselves antagonistically to those whose sharper
  expressions of political vision are hugely popular with those who are
  abandoning them. Senior Democrats might still not endorse New York City
  mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who is posting stunning polling leads.
  Labour disciplines MPs for rebelling against benefit cuts, even as hundreds of
  thousands of people register their support for a new party. But as new and
  future voters are lost, the lion’s share of the windfall goes to those on the
  right and extreme right who have already mastered the gamification of
  politics, and the ability to summon fever dreams of threats that must be dealt
  with and prosperity that is just around the corner. “Elections are won from
  the centre” goes the old adage, but increasingly the centre itself has changed
  as the world becomes not a place of wide-tent compromise, but of
  irreconcilable differences. And I would venture another formulation –
  elections are won in the past. By the time it becomes apparent that remote and
  complacent centrist politics is not even managing to convince its own tribes,
  it will be too late. Some would argue it already is. Nesrine Malik is a
