  Women’s groups have said a high court judgment dismissing a libel claim
  against the Guardian by actor Noel Clarke marks a victory not just for his
  victims, but for press freedom and public interest reporting as a whole. They
  said too often “wealthy and abusive men” have been able to use the courts to
  try to silence victims, hiding “behind injunctions, NDAs, [and] threats of
  defamation suits”. Clarke claimed the allegations published by the Guardian
  after an investigation were false and he had been the victim of an unlawful
  conspiracy. During the five-week civil case, 26 witnesses gave evidence
  against him, detailing allegations of bullying and professional and sexual
  misconduct. On Friday, Mrs Justice Steyn rejected Clarke’s claims, ruling the
  Guardian had proved both its defences: truth and public interest. The judge
  said that while she accepted some of Clarke’s evidence, “overall I find that
  he was not a credible or reliable witness”. Harriet Wistrich, lawyer and chief
  executive of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said the judgment was “great
  news” and “a blow to wealthy and famous men who think they can use money to
  silence women”. “Noel Clarke could easily have avoided being named as a sexual
  predator accused of harassing women. All he had to do was not act in ways that
  constitute sexual harassment,” said Karen Ingala Smith, former chief executive
  of domestic and sexual violence charity nia. “Clarke now adds himself to the
  list of wealthy abusive men who have tried and failed to use the law to
  minimise, hide or deny their behaviour,” she added. “My thoughts are with his
  victims and I am glad justice has been upheld.” Charlotte Proudman, a
  barrister whose book He Said, She Said revealed how women are silenced in the
  family courts, said: “This judgment is a landmark moment for survivors of
  sexual misconduct and for investigative journalism. “The court’s finding that
  the Guardian’s reporting was substantially true sends a clear message: women
  who come forward should be believed, and journalists who investigate abuse
  play a vital role in holding perpetrators to account. “It is a victory not
  just for the women who bravely spoke out, but for press freedom and public
  interest reporting as a whole.” Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence
  Against Women Coalition, said: “It is vital that there is freedom to report on
  cases like this, yet we know that journalists are often held back from
  reporting due to the threat of legal action from those with power and status.
  “The law should not be weaponised by perpetrators to silence survivors.
  However, this often plays out in the criminal justice system and the media,
  with women’s credibility put under the microscope, contributing to a culture
  of disbelief of women across society.” Earlier this summer, the UK government
  announced plans to stop bosses using NDAs to silence abused workers. “For so
  long predatory and abusive men have hidden behind injunctions, NDAs, threats
  of defamation suits and blacklisting campaigns against victims,” said Jamie
  Klingler, co-founder of Reclaim These Streets. “All credit is due to those
  survivors and to Kath Viner and the team of journalists that refused to back
  down and kowtow to teams of lawyers intent on denying the multitude of
  accounts of sexual misconduct by their client.”
