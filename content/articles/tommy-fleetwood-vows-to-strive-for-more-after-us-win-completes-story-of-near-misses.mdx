  Tommy Fleetwood insisted he is ready to write a fresh chapter of golfing
  success after ending his wait for a victory in the United States after 11
  years. Fleetwood’s three-stroke win at the Tour Championship in Atlanta came
  in his 164th start on the PGA Tour. While determined to enjoy the moment, the
  34-year-old from Southport has no plans to rest on his laurels. Fleetwood had
  been probed time and again about his series of near misses in the US. “The
  guys that win the most are in contention so much, they’re up there all the
  time,” Fleetwood said. “That’s where I want to be. I want to be up there. It’s
  taken me a while to get this done, to get this first win. I’ve never looked at
  it as just trying to win once. I’ve always had the mindset that I want to win
  multiple. I want to win plenty. It’s just that the first one seems to have
  taken a long time. “The next one might take a long time; I don’t know. But
  I’ve always had the mindset that I just want to be one of the best players in
  the world, I want to keep putting myself in contention. I always felt like it
  would probably happen. “It completes the story of the near misses and it has a
  crescendo to what has been building towards the back end of the season. But
  when I go home, I’m just going to start practising again. I’m going to start
  working again and I’m going to look towards the next tournament.” Fleetwood is
  likely to move to sixth in the world. He collected a cheque for $10m at East
  Lake. Patrick Cantlay and Russell Henley were nudged into second place as
  Fleetwood’s closing 68 left him on 18 under par. The Englishman’s victory was
  a hugely popular one throughout golf. “I think it’s easy for anybody to say
  that they are resilient, that they bounce back, that they have fight,”
  Fleetwood added. “It’s different when you actually have to prove it. There’s
  different types of mental strength. I’ve clearly got things wrong in the dire
  moments of tournaments and I might have made the odd dodgy decision, might
  have put a bad swing on it. But I’ve had to have mental strength in a
  different way. I’ve had to be resilient in terms of putting myself back up
  there, getting myself back in that position, no matter how many times it
  doesn’t go my way, no matter how many doubts might creep in. “Think the right
  things, say the right things to yourself, say the right things outwardly, and
  I am really pleased that I can be proof that if you do all the right things
  and you just keep going that it can happen.” Tiger Woods was amongst those to
  praise Fleetwood in the immediate aftermath of his victory. “Your journey is a
  reminder that hard work, resilience and heart do pay off,” Woods posted on
  social media. “No one deserves it more.” Away from sporting superstars,
  Fleetwood has been identified by the public as a hugely relatable athlete.
  “I’ve always been very lucky that I make a great connection with people,”
  Fleetwood said. “If I could give my kids one piece of advice, there’s tons of
  advice but I always tell them to be a good person first and I’ve always tried
  to do that. “My dad always told me that, even when I was a young, aspiring
  amateur golfer, professional golfer, he always said person first, golfer
  second. You’re a good person first. Whatever happens after that, you try to be
  a good golfer second. I’ve always tried to be that.”
