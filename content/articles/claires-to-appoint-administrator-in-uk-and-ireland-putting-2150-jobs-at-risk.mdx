  The fashion accessories retailer Claire’s has said it is preparing to appoint
  administrators in the UK and Ireland, putting 2,150 jobs at risk. The tween
  jewellery and ear-piercing retailer has struggled to arrest the fall in sales
  at its 278 stores in the UK and 28 in Ireland in the face of competition from
  online retailers such as Amazon. Claire’s has filed a notice of intention to
  appoint the administrator Interpath, which will assess “all options” for the
  company while it continues to trade. Chris Cramer, the chief executive of
  Claire’s, said: “This decision, while difficult, is part of our broader effort
  to protect the long-term value of Claire’s across all markets. “In the UK,
  taking this step will allow us to continue to trade the business while we
  explore the best possible path forward. We are deeply grateful to our
  employees, partners and our customers during this challenging period.”
  Claire’s in the US and Canada filed for bankruptcy this month. The chain,
  which also operates stores under the Icing jewellery and cosmetics brand, is
  owned by a group of firms, including the US hedge fund Elliott Management.
  Will Wright, the UK chief executive of Interpath, said: “Claire’s has long
  been a popular brand across the UK, known not only for its trend-led
  accessories but also as the go-to destination for ear-piercing. “Over the
  coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going
  concern for as long as we can, while we assess options for the company. This
  includes exploring the possibility of a sale which would secure a future for
  this well-loved brand.” Interpath had been working to find a buyer for
  Claire’s UK and European businesses, which has a combined workforce thought to
  be about 5,000, to avoid administration. Last week it was reported that
  potential bidders for the British arm of Claire’s, including the Lakeland
  owner Hilco Capital, had backed away from making an offer for the business.
  There has been speculation that as many as a third of the UK shops might need
  to be closed if the chain is to survive. Susannah Streeter, head of money and
  markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It looks certain that more stores will
  close, given the liability the store footprint has become for the company.”
  Founded in 1961, Claire’s has been a staple in British shopping centres and
  high streets. Products such as ear-piercings and on-trend jewellery made it
  particularly popular among teenagers. “Claire’s attraction has waned, with its
  high street stores failing to pull in the business they used to,” said
  Streeter. “While they may still be a beacon for younger girls, families aren’t
  heading out on so many shopping trips, with footfall in retail centres
  falling. The chain is now faced with stiff competition from TikTok and
  Instagram shops, and by cheap accessories sold by fast fashion giants like
  Shein and Temu. “Having so many stores across the UK used to be great for
  brand recognition; now names are recognised from social media feeds not
  building fascia.” Claire’s operates more than 2,750 stores across 17 countries
  in North America and Europe. Its British arm has made losses of £25m over the
  past three years. The most recent figures showed it made a loss of £4.7m in
  the 12 months to the end of March last year, following a £5m loss the previous
  year. The UK operation has an outstanding loan of $480m (£355m) that is due to
  be repaid by December next year. The US operation previously declared
  bankruptcy in 2018 after it was unable to repay a loan but recovered seven
  months later after wiping about $1.9bn from its balance sheet.
