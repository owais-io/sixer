  The immigrant population of the United States, which has been growing for more
  than 50 years, has declined by more than a million people since Donald Trump
  took office in January and defined immigration as a threat to the nation, not
  one of its strengths. According to a new study by the Pew Research Center,
  there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the US in January, when Trump
  took office for the second time. By June, that number had dropped to 51.9
  million. Among all US residents, 15.4% were immigrants as of June 2025, down
  from the recent historic high of 15.8% in January. The Pew survey also found
  that 750,000 immigrant workers had dropped out of the US labor force since
  January, which is now 19% foreign-born. The center pointed to several policy
  changes that have affected immigrant populations across the US, including Joe
  Biden’s restrictions on asylum applications in 2024, which led to a
  significant decrease in border crossings involving immigrants seeking asylum.
  Additionally, the center pointed to Donald Trump’s 181 executive actions
  targeting immigration, including the arrival of new immigrants and the mass
  deportation of non-citizen immigrants. The center noted that the change in the
  data could be due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants. Mexico
  remains the largest origin country among US immigrants. As of mid-2023, more
  than 11 million US residents were born in Mexico, marking nearly a quarter, or
  22%, of all immigrants nationally. Nevertheless, immigration from Mexico has
  declined since 2007 and the Mexican-born population in the US has dropped.
  From 2010 to 2023, the Mexican share of the US immigrant population dropped
  from 29% to 22%, according to Pew’s research. The second-largest immigrant
  group was from India, at 3.2 million, or 6% of the total immigrant population,
  as of mid-2023. The next largest immigrant groups were from China, at 3
  million, or 6%, followed by the Philippines, at 2.1 million, or 4%, and Cuba,
  at 1.7 million, or 3%. In July, a Guardian analysis of arrest and deportation
  data revealed how Trump has “supercharged the country’s immigration
  enforcement apparatus – pushing immigration officials to arrest a record
  number of people”. The analysis found that average daily arrests were up by
  268% compared with June 2024 and that the US Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement agency (Ice) was targeting all unauthorized immigrants, including
  people with no criminal records. The analysis also found that the US had
  deported more than 8,100 people to countries that are not their home country.
  Trump’s crackdown on immigration has shown no signs of stopping, with the
  state department announcing this week that it is reviewing the records of more
  than 55 million foreign citizens with visas allowing them to visit or reside
  temporarily in the US for potential revocation.
