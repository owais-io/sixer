  The Republican lawmakers who voted for Donald Trump’s anti-environment tax and
  spending bill have accepted more than $105m in political donations from the
  fossil fuel industry, a new analysis has found, raising concerns about their
  relationship with big oil. Signed into law last month, the One Big Beautiful
  Bill Act includes billions of dollars in giveaways to oil and gas companies
  and their executives, alongside provisions to scale back credits for clean
  vehicles, wind and solar which were enshrined by Joe Biden’s Inflation
  Reduction Act (IRA). All but two GOP House members voted to support the budget
  bill, as did all but three GOP senators. That includes many Republicans from
  districts who benefited most from the IRA’s green credits, and those who spent
  months attempting to defend renewable energy tax credits from the budget
  bill’s provisions, such as Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York and
  Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah. The new report from
  the environmental advocacy group Climate Power totalled up the funds the
  bill’s backers have accepted from the fossil fuel industry over the course of
  their political careers, finding that House members accepted $54.4m and
  senators accepted $51.5m. “These Republicans in Congress are caught red-handed
  taking massive donations from the oil and gas industry, and voting to give
  them billions and to destroy their competition from their own state’s clean
  energy industries,” the analysis says. With House midterm elections scheduled
  for next year, Climate Power also looked at fossil fuel donations to the 15
  House Republicans deemed most vulnerable to an electoral challenge, according
  to the Cook Political Report, which independently analyzes the political
  viability of elections and campaigns. All 15 backed the mega-bill, and
  together, they accepted more than $3m in donations from the fossil fuel
  industry, the authors found. Hailing from Colorado, Iowa, Arizona, New Jersey,
  California, Michigan and New York, the lawmakers on the list are from regions
  that have seen benefits from the IRA’s credits for wind and solar energy, as
  well as battery manufacturing. The mega-bill puts more than 110,000 jobs from
  the three sectors at risk in the 15 lawmakers’ districts, and is also expected
  to raise consumers’ energy bills by up to $200 annually by 2030, according to
  the climate policy thinktank Energy Innovation. Some on the list had
  previously critiqued the bill: Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa,
  who has accepted $229,179 in oil and gas contributions, pledged to support
  clean energy tax credits but backed the legislation anyway, while Colorado’s
  Jeff Hurd, pledged to oppose the bill due to its cuts to Medicaid but ended up
  supporting it. “These Republican members of Congress all represent moderate
  swing districts with close elections, where voters of both parties expect
  their representatives to look out for them, not to kill their jobs and raise
  their utility bills for the sake of out-of-state special interests,” said Pete
  Jones, a director at Climate Power. “These members chose who to stand up for,
  and they picked their billionaire donors.” Big oil spent a stunning $445m
  throughout the last election cycle to influence Trump and Congress, Climate
  Power found in January. The industry also poured more than $19m into Trump’s
  inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a report
  found last month. “We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold
  under our feet that will help to do it,” Trump said in his inaugural address.
  Since re-entering the White House, Trump has passed not only the
  anti-environmental One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but has also signed a slew of
  executive orders and policies aimed at cracking down on clean energy and
  boosting already-booming oil and gas.
