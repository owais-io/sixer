  The inner workings of Donald Trump’s mind have long provoked bemusement and
  speculation, with his often erratic opinions driven seemingly by grievance and
  anecdote rather than evidence. But on one topic Trump has remained resolutely
  consistent: he hates wind turbines – and, more latterly, renewable energy in
  general. This enmity burst into view in 2011 – four years before he descended
  his golden escalator to announce he was running for US president – when Trump
  waged an unsuccessful battle to halt “ugly” offshore turbines visible from his
  Scottish golf course. In a sort of circular moment, Trump was back in Scotland
  earlier this week to fulminate once again about wind energy. “Wind is a
  disaster,” the US president said in a press conference at his Turnberry golf
  course in Scotland, beside a doleful-looking Keir Starmer. “You are paying
  massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place.” Starmer,
  for his part, said that “we believe in a mix” that includes wind but did not
  mention the pressing reason for clean energy – a climate crisis that is
  unleashing its fury in increasing bursts in the UK, US and elsewhere. Instead
  the British prime minister embraced the more Trump-friendly theme of energy
  security. But Trump’s distress at wind turbines now holds global, rather than
  merely golfing, implications. As president he has banned renewable energy
  projects from federal lands and signed a spending bill that kills off tax
  credits that were fostering a boom in new, clean energy supply. The amount of
  new clean energy additions is now expected to be half of what it would have
  been over the next decade as a result, with the added loss of several hundred
  thousand jobs and billions of dollars of investment that was set to gush into
  rural and exurban America. “It’s an expensive energy, it’s an ugly energy and
  we won’t allow it in the United States,” Trump boasted at his Scottish summit
  with Starmer. As the world’s second-largest carbon emitter, the US’s decision
  to bring the hammer down on renewables has major implications for a rapidly
  warming planet. Around 7bn tonnes of extra greenhouse gases are set to be
  added to the atmosphere in just the next five years – more than double India’s
  annual emissions – as American utilities turn to gas and coal rather than
  cleaner sources of energy. Clean energy still remains remarkably attractive –
  wind and solar have plummeted in cost over the past decade and are now almost
  always cheaper than fossil fuels even without subsidies, as the United Nations
  pointed out last week. Almost all new electricity capacity in the US is set to
  come from renewables this year – after all, it’s not only cheaper but far
  quicker to start up a windfarm than a gas plant. But the climate crisis has
  always been a timed challenge. Even as renewables advance, they must do so far
  faster if the world has a chance of fending off spiralling climate disasters.
  The fixation of one man in the White House is stamping on the brakes at the
  very moment when scientists are urging accelerated cuts in emissions. The
  backtracking on renewables also poses geopolitical, as well as environmental,
  questions. China, which Trump often disparages as a rival, is already
  streaking ahead of the world in erecting wind and solar facilities and
  envisions a future run on clean energy that it will then sell to other
  countries – a Chinese EV in the garage overlooked by a Chinese-made windfarm
  in the hills. The US is making a very different bet: that the world will
  continue to run, as it has for more than a century, on the burning of fossil
  fuels and it will look to America’s vast supply of oil and gas for sustenance.
  “This is the most pro-combustion administration since Nero,” as one
  environmental group put it this week as Trump unveiled plans to eliminate a
  foundational finding that greenhouse gases harm human health and set about
  demolishing pollution limits for cars and oil and gas drilling sites. The
  pathway that the world chooses will not only shape our shared climate but
  also, potentially, the fortunes of the world’s two superpowers in the decades
  ahead. “This marks a new chapter in the global climate story, it will
  significantly reposition these two major powers,” as Li Shuo, an expert in
  China’s climate policies, told me. “The last chance for the US to jump on the
  green bandwagon has left the station.” Read more: Tilting at windmills?
