  Good morning. With temperatures soaring across Europe, fears of drought and
  people trying to steer clear of the most severe heat, there’s one place
  millions of us will still not be comfortable: home. The Guardian’s Hot
  Property series shows how the poorest and most vulnerable are trapped inside
  dangerously hot homes. Even for today’s temperatures much housing is
  inadequate, let alone the even more extreme heat predicted for the coming
  years, the reporting shows. For readers living in London and the south-east,
  temperatures of 28C inside the home is likely to become normal in the coming
  decades. While everyone is feeling the heat, the impacts are not spread
  equally. Lower-income families, social renters, those with children, and
  ethnic minorities are more likely to live in really hot homes. For many it’s
  not just a question of comfort, but staying healthy, too. Swathes of central
  and eastern Europe are facing another heatwave and heat warnings have been
  issued across England. To find out why England’s homes are so stifling, who is
  affected and what can be done about it, I spoke to environment reporter Helena
  Horton. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war |
  Hundreds of mourners carried the body of the prominent Al Jazeera journalist
  Anas al-Sharif through the streets of Gaza City on Monday, a day after he and
  four colleagues were killed in an Israeli airstrike, prompting condemnation
  from across the world. NHS | Attacks on A&amp;E nurses have almost doubled
  over the last six years, with incidents often involving patients frustrated at
  waiting so long for care. US news | Donald Trump has ordered the national
  guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city’s police force,
  describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at odds with official
  crime statistics. UK news | David Lammy is facing possible legal action over a
  plan to invite staff from the oil firm Shell and the defence firm BAE Systems
  to work inside the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Agriculture |
  A study has found that Biochar, a charcoal made from human waste, could help
  solve fertiliser shortages as well as reduce pollution and energy use. In
  depth: Hot property, cold policy – and what needs to change “We all know we
  don’t do well with extreme heat in the UK – we’re not really prepared for it,”
  says Helena Horton. “This country hasn’t historically got truly hot
  regularly.” With climate breakdown, temperatures already topped 40C during the
  summer of 2022, and such record-breaking heat is likely to be repeated. Yet we
  live in homes that were not designed to withstand extreme temperatures. “When
  you go on holiday to a country that is used to heat, you don’t swelter in your
  home like you do in England because they design homes differently. We wanted
  to look at why that is, who is affected and what can be done,” says Helena.
  Overall, one-fifth of homes in England overheat in current summer
  temperatures, but the research showed this is not a threat that is borne
  equally. Helena says she was surprised by how marked the differences were. The
  analysis of housing stock, by the Resolution Foundation, found that people who
  owned their homes are much less likely to suffer from the risks of
  overheating. Two-thirds of socially renting households are at risk of their
  homes getting too hot, while the figure is just 17% for those that are
  owner-occupied. Almost half of minority ethnic households also face the
  highest risk of their homes getting too hot. More than half of homes in London
  are at risk of overheating because they suffer more from an urban heat island
  effect. Small flats, small homes and overcrowded spaces are all especially
  vulnerable. There is no reason to believe that devolved nations are building
  more heat-resilient homes. *** What are the impacts on health? In this
  analysis of why we’re so unprepared for overheating homes, the Guardian’s
  environment editor Fiona Harvey tells readers to banish visions of sipping
  Yorkshire champagne on a Barcelona-style balcony and instead think of
  sleepless nights in stuffy homes as an indication of what future British
  summers will be like. “It’s about how we’re going to survive our summers
  happily, and healthily,” says Helena. “It’s about people being comfortable in
  our homes. We all know how horrible it is when you can’t sleep properly for a
  week because it’s so hot in your house.” For some people, it’s about more than
  just comfort. When temperatures inside rise above 25C, risks to health rise.
  This has been linked to increased cardiovascular and respiratory issues,
  mental health problems and heat exhaustion. For some, hot homes can be deadly.
  During the heatwaves in 2024, an estimated 358 people died at home in part due
  to extreme temperatures, according to figures from the UK Health Security
  Agency. Deaths tend to spike because the heat exacerbates existing medical
  conditions. For example, overall influenza and pneumonia deaths were 13%
  higher than usual during the 2024 heatwaves, and circulatory disease deaths,
  dementia and Alzheimer’s deaths were up 11%. *** What can be done about it? As
  part of the Guardian series, Sammy Gecsoyler wrote about the sweltering
  conditions inside Leaside Lock, a new-build development in east London.
  Residents told him of “unbearable” heat at night, frequent headaches and
  fatigue. It’s a story being repeated all over the country. England has some of
  the oldest housing stock in Europe, but that isn’t what’s causing all the
  problems. “Quite a lot of new builds are the ones that are getting really
  hot,” says Helena. “It’s both the old housing being inadequate and new housing
  not being built with these standards in mind.” In terms of design, the advice
  is to think Mediterranean. This includes having good ventilation and airflow
  to cool rooms, external shutters and well-designed windows, and reflective
  paint on roofs or outside surfaces. Opening windows at night, once the outside
  air has cooled, can help to cool down a home. Air conditioning is an obvious
  option, and heat pumps could also be used. Street trees are a simple and cost
  effective way to keep homes cool. The UK Green Building Council advocates
  having 30% tree canopy cover within your neighbourhood, with each resident no
  more than 300 metres from a biodiverse green space or park. “It’s amazing how
  much of a difference even things like street trees make,” says Helena. ***
  Where is government policy on this issue? Building rules have focused on
  keeping homes warm in winter and saving on energy bills, not cooling them down
  in summer. Air conditioning is common in hot countries and, for many, is
  thought to be a lifesaver. Ministers are considering subsidising the
  installation of air conditioning in the UK for the first time, but that would
  be a controversial departure from climate policy because they’re so energy
  intensive. Air conditioning causes 3% of greenhouse gas emissions, with demand
  set to triple by 2050. New rules aimed at overhauling how new homes are built
  have been promised for two decades. The first attempt was set out by Labour in
  2008. This autumn, the future homes standard (FHS) should finally be
  published, with it due to come into force from 2027. However, experts warn it
  still doesn’t adequately deal with the new challenge of cooling homes during
  summer, and focuses instead on how to keep draughty homes warm in winter
  (although insulating homes to retain heat in winter can help keep heat out in
  summer). As it stands, there are no substantial plans to retrofit the bulk of
  the UK’s existing homes to withstand sweltering heat. What else we’ve been
  reading If you ever feel as if Britain can’t “do” big infrastructural projects
  any more, Jonn Elledge has a lovely read on the unqualified success of the
  Elizabeth line (pictured above) – not just as a mass transit service but as a
  conduit for job and housing growth along its lines. As he rightly asks: “If it
  worked this well, why on earth are we not building more of it?” Charlie
  Lindlar, acting deputy editor, newsletters I was moved by the last words of
  Anas al-Sharif, one of five Al Jazeera journalists killed by an Israeli
  airstrike on Sunday: “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted
  suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth
  as it is.” Phoebe As part of the Guardian’s Edinburgh fringe coverage, Anya
  Ryan reports on a truly haunting development: ventriloquism is trendy. Charlie
  Many brilliant one-liners from the “apple-cheeked and foul-mouthed” Miriam
  Margolyes in this piece on the delights of performing at the fringe in your
  80s. Also, good lessons on how to age. Phoebe With plans expected this autumn
  to mandate eye tests for older drivers, Guardian readers spoke to Jane Clinton
  with their takes on the idea, ranging from “basic common sense” to “why just
  leave it at over-70s?” Charlie Sport Football | Crystal Palace have lost their
  appeal against demotion from the Europa League and will take their place in
  the Conference League. The court of arbitration for sport confirmed that the
  FA Cup winners were unsuccessful in overturning the decision made by European
  football’s governing body to punish them for contravening its rules over
  multi-club ownership. Rugby union | Rugby union is to introduce flashing LED
  mouthguards that light up when a player suffers a significant head impact
  during a match. Dr Lindsay Starling, a science and medical manager at World
  Rugby, said the new system would debut at the Women’s Rugby World Cup, which
  begins next week. Football | Jack Grealish is poised to sign for Everton on
  loan after agreeing to leave Manchester City in an attempt to revive his
  stalled career. Everton’s interest in the City midfielder was reciprocated
  over the weekend with Grealish accepting the opportunity to join Everton in
  their first season at Hill Dickinson Stadium. The front pages The Guardian
  leads with “‘The truth has died’: global fury as Israeli strike kills
  journalists”. The Mail has “A&amp;E waits fuel 4,000 attacks on NHS staff a
  year”. The Financial Times reports “Trump opens door to Nvidia selling best AI
  chips to China”. The Mirror looks at a shake-up of drink-driving laws with
  “None for the road” The Times looks ahead to a meeting between the leaders of
  the US and Russia on Friday, with “Trump: I will try to get Ukraine some land
  back”. The Telegraph claims “Kyiv ready to give up land for peace”, while the
  i has “Don’t trust Putin, Starmer warns Trump – as Zelensky cut out of crunch
  Ukraine summit”. Finally, the Sun reports on Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz
  renewing their vows, under the headline: “To have &amp; hold a grudge”. Today
  in Focus The Trump-Putin summit The Guardian journalist Shaun Walker and the
  former British ambassador to Russia Laurie Bristow talk through Friday’s
  impending summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska and discuss
  where it will leave the war in Ukraine. Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The
  Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Food
  writer Angela Hui offers much food for thought in a charming piece for our One
  change that worked series: the power of complimenting strangers. Always
  envious of those who easily light up rooms, Hui set herself a challenge to be
  more inquisitive and deliberate in seeking out conversation by chatting to one
  new person a day. “Whether it’s a cashier, a barista or someone walking past
  me, I try to say it out loud instead of just thinking it,” Hui writes. “The
  other day, in the queue at Golden Gate Bakery in London’s Chinatown, I told an
  older Asian woman her perm looked incredible. All bounce, no frizz. We ended
  up bonding over which bakeries still make proper old-school Chinese pineapple
  buns.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every
