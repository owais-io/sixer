  A sultry, windless afternoon and the air above the garden path is shimmering.
  It’s too hot to do anything much during this heat, other than stand here and
  watch the carnage unfolding on this 7ft-tall cardoon plant. It was early June
  when we first noticed the small clusters of black aphids. Looking closer, we
  watched a long column of ants, from the nest under the paving stone, climbing
  the stems, tending the aphids, stroking them with their antennae and legs,
  encouraging them to produce drops of sweet honeydew. Aphid “farming” by ants
  has been documented for centuries and was meticulously observed in 1882 by Sir
  John Lubbock, MP, polymath and friend of Darwin, in his book Ants, Bees and
  Wasps. He watched aphid colonies grow, noting that their ant herders moved
  some to new locations on the host plant, founding new colonies. And that seems
  to have happened on our cardoon. By early July new aphid colonies had
  proliferated and flower stems were soon covered with thousands of sap suckers,
  so many that the plant’s great armoured inflorescences bowed their heads for
  want of sustenance. Then came flying ant day. The herders’ colony rapidly
  declined – but the aphid population explosion continued, raining droplets of
  uncollected honeydew, coating leaves in sucrose. Now it was the turn of hordes
  of hoverflies, arriving to lap up the sticky sweetness and lay their deadly
  eggs among the aphids. When the predatory, slug-like larvae hatched they
  wreaked havoc. Today the ants have gone, and the stems and leaves have the
  melancholy post-apocalyptic air of a battlefield, strewn with withered aphid
  corpses. Seven-spot, 14-spot and harlequin ladybirds roam the leaves, mopping
  up huddles of survivors. More opportunists arrive: neon purple and metallic
  blue jewel wasps; agitated, hyperactive ichneumon wasps; scurrying spider
  mites and a host of small flies. The aphid infestation is almost over. Wilted
  flower buds are reviving and some, a little smaller than usual, have opened
  their spectacular crowns of blue florets, beloved by bumblebees. Over the last
  month we’ve witnessed a great pyramid of interconnected life assemble here, an
  unfolding drama with an ever-changing cast. One puff of insecticide, six weeks
  ago, and this enthralling pulse of biodiversity would never have happened. •
