  Uefa has paid more than €10.8m (£9.4m) in “solidarity” funds to Russian
  football clubs since they were banned from taking part in European tournaments
  after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian can reveal. The payments
  were made despite five Ukrainian clubs failing to receive similar such funds
  allegedly due to their locations being in a “zone of military operations”.
  Solidarity payments are generally provided to clubs that fail to do well
  enough at the domestic level to get into European competitions. They are
  designed to “maintain competitive balance in Europe’s top divisions in light
  of the additional revenue some clubs receive through participation in European
  competitions”, according to Uefa. Russian clubs and the country’s national
  team have been banned from taking part in international competitions since
  Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Despite the
  ban, Uefa paid €3,305,000 in solidarity payments to the Russian football
  association in 2022-23, a further €3,381,000 in 2023-24, and €4,224,000 for
  the 2024-25 season. There was also a payment of €6,209,000 in 2021-22,
  according to Uefa circulars. The football association is obliged to pass on
  the money to the clubs. At the same time, the directors of five Ukrainian
  clubs wrote to the president of Uefa, Aleksander Čeferin, a Slovenian lawyer,
  on 27 July to complain of an “extraordinary situation” in which their
  “solidarity” payments for 2023-24 and 2024-25 were withheld. The affected
  teams are Chornomorets and Real Pharma, which are based in Odesa; IFC Metalurg
  from Zaporizhzhia; FSC Phoenix Mariupol from the occupied southern port city;
  and FC Metalist 1925 from Kharkiv. The clubs’ directors wrote: “As a result of
  our communication with both the national association and Uefa officials we
  have been informed that the obstacle to the above payments is some completely
  unclear requirements of a bank in Switzerland, which allegedly relate to the
  geographical location of the football clubs in the ‘war zone’. “We have not
  received any more detailed information or any legal justification for these
  restrictions on payments. The wording used in relation to the ‘zone of
  military operations’ is completely unclear to us and does not correspond to
  reality. “The zone of military operations, or rather the zone of military
  aggression of Russia, is not a specific region of our country, but the whole
  of Ukraine.” The port city of Mariupol and parts of the Zaporizhzhia region in
  south-east Ukraine are occupied but that is not the case for Odesa, in the
  south, nor Kharkiv in the north-east. The letter to Čeferin continues: “Many
  loyal Ukrainian football fans went to the front from the first days of the
  aggressions, many of them will unfortunately never be able to support their
  teams at the stadium, having died with the names of their favourite people and
  the name of their favourite team on their lips. “Therefore in this difficult
  time for our country, any additional financial assistance and support will
  certainly help the clubs to ease the burden of financial expenses which, as
  mentioned above, due to the circumstances of military aggression cannot be
  balanced by possible revenues.” A spokesperson for Uefa initially said they
  would provide a statement to explain the payments but then failed to offer any
  response. The revelation will raise fresh concern about Uefa’s approach to the
  Kremlin. Russia has retained its presence within Uefa because its federation,
  the Russian Football Union, has not been suspended. Polina Yumasheva, the
  former wife of the Kremlin’s “favourite industrialist”, the billionaire
  oligarch Oleg Deripaska, sits on Uefa’s governance and compliance committee.
  She is the daughter of a former adviser to Putin. In September 2022, Ukraine’s
  manager Oleksandr Petrakov was fined by Uefa after he vowed in an interview
  with the Guardian to take up arms against Russia after its invasion of his
  country. Uefa also attempted to reintroduce Russia’s under-17s team to
  international football in 2023 but the proposal was withdrawn after a dozen
  national associations, including England’s, publicly expressed their
  opposition. In a letter to Uefa last March, the executive committee of the
  Ukrainian football association complained that Russian clubs were being given
  Uefa ranking points in each season that they are suspended. The total number
  of points earned by a country in a season determines how many teams in their
  domestic game will take part in European tournaments, including the Champions
  League. The number of points given to Russia equates to the lowest that
  Russian teams have earned in the last five seasons, but critics have argued
  that it undermines the impact of the international suspension.
