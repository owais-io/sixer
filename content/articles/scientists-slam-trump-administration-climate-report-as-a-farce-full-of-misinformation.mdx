  A new Trump administration report which attempts to justify a mass rollback of
  environmental regulations is chock-full of climate misinformation, experts
  say. On Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a
  proposal to undo the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which allows the agency to
  limit planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other
  industrial sources. Hours later, the Department of Energy (DOE) published a
  150-page report defending the proposal, claiming scientific concern about the
  climate crisis is overblown. “Climate change is a challenge – not a
  catastrophe,” wrote the energy secretary, Chris Wright, in the report’s
  introduction. The esteemed climate scientist Michael Mann said the report was
  akin to the result he would expect “if you took a chatbot and you trained it
  on the top 10 fossil fuel industry-funded climate denier websites”. The energy
  department published the report hours after the EPA announced a plan to roll
  back 2009’s “endangerment finding”, a seminal ruling that provided the legal
  basis for the agency to regulate climate-heating pollution under the Clean Air
  Act. If finalized, the move would topple virtually all US climate regulation.
  In a Fox News interview, Wright claimed the report pushed back on the “cancel
  culture Orwellian squelching of science”. But Naomi Oreskes, a history of
  science professor at Harvard University and expert in climate misinformation,
  said its true purpose was to “justify what is a scientifically unjustifiable
  failure to regulate fossil fuels”. “Science is the basis for climate
  regulation, so now they are trying to replace legitimate science with
  pseudoscience,” she said. ‘This is an agenda to promote fossil fuels’ The
  attack on the research underpinning the endangerment finding – which says
  greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare – comes as part of Trump’s
  “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are the primary cause
  of global warming. “This is an agenda to promote fossil fuels, not to protect
  public health and welfare or the environment,” said Rachel Cleetus, a director
  at climate and science non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists who was an
  author on the sixth US national climate assessment. Asked about scientists’
  assertions that the new report is rife with misinformation, an energy
  department spokesperson, Ben Dietderich, said: “This report critically
  assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are frequently assigned
  high levels of confidence – not by the scientists themselves but by the
  political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or previous presidential
  administrations.” But the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  (IPCC) produces what is widely considered the gold standard compendium of
  climate science, compiled by a huge multinational team of scientists,
  peer-reviewed and agreed to by every national government. The latest IPCC
  synthesis report, released two years ago, was a vast undertaking involving 721
  volunteer scientists around the world. It states that it is “unequivocal” that
  human activity has heated the planet, which has “led to widespread adverse
  impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people”. By contrast, the
  Trump administration report was crafted by five handpicked scientists who are
  seen as having fringe or contrarian views by mainstream climate scientists,
  with no peer review. The experts behind the report have previously denied
  being climate deniers. The energy department did not respond to a question
  about the authors. “This report had five authors and was rushed over four
  months, and would not pass muster in any traditional scientific peer review
  process,” said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at the climate non-profit
  Berkeley Earth, who called the paper a “farce”. Wright, the energy secretary,
  insisted he had not steered the report’s conclusions, while Judith Curry, one
  of the report authors, said in a blogpost she hoped the document would push
  climate science “away from alarmism and advocacy”. ‘I’m embarrassed by this
  report’ Mainstream climate scientists, however, condemned the findings as
  distorted and inaccurate. “This is a report written by a couple of scientists
  who are outliers in their arguments for climate change,” said Natalie
  Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University. “This document does in no
  way depreciate the value of previous assessments, but rather just cherrypicks
  the literature to pretend to create a new review.” Mahowald said the lack of
  peer review meant it was “obviously not as robust” as the IPCC report or the
  US government’s periodic national climate assessment, which the Trump
  administration recently took offline. The latest national climate assessment,
  compiled by a dozen government agencies and outside scientists in 2023,
  concluded that the “effects of human-caused climate change are already
  far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States” “If
  almost any other group of scientists had been chosen, the report would have
  been dramatically different,” Andrew Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas
  A&amp;M University, said of the new report. “The only way to get this report
  was to pick these authors.” Hausfather agreed that the authors’ work “might
  represent their views but is not consistent with the broader scientific
  literature on climate change”. He was among the scientists whose work the
  authors cited. The new paper includes a chart from a 2019 report which he led,
  claiming it demonstrates how climate models “consistently overestimated
  observations” of atmospheric carbon. But Hausfather’s research actually showed
  that climate models have performed well. “They appear to have discarded the
  whole paper as not fitting their narrative, and instead picked a single figure
  that was in the supplementary materials to cast doubt on models when the whole
  paper actually confirmed how well they have performed in the years after they
  were published,” he said. The energy department did not respond to a request
  for comment about Hausfather’s concerns. That approach to research seems to
  underpin the entire paper, said Hausfather, who is also the climate research
  lead at tech company Stripe. “This is a general theme in the report; they
  cherrypick data points that suit their narrative and exclude the vast majority
  of the scientific literature that does not,” he said. Dessler said scientists
  are obliged to engage with the full range of evidence, even if it contradicts
  their initial assumptions. Ignoring this principle “can rise to the level of
  scientific misconduct”, he said. “The report they produced should be thought
  of as a law brief from attorneys defending their client, carbon dioxide,”
  Dessler said. “Their goal is not to weigh the evidence fairly but to build the
  strongest possible case for CO2’s innocence.” The lack of peer review in the
  administration’s report led to conclusions that deviated, sometimes wildly,
  from the scientific literature. Many of its claims are based on long-debunked
  research long promoted by climate deniers, said Mann. “It is shop worn,
  decades-old, discredited climate denier talking points, dressed up in the
  clothing of some sensible new set of revelations,” he said. “What’s different
  is that it has the imprimatur of the EPA and the federal government now.” The
  report, for instance, claims that warming trends have been overstated, despite
  evidence to the contrary. It was published as extreme heat is affecting
  millions of Americans. “They’re literally trying to tell us not to believe
  what we see with our own two eyes … and instead buy into their denialist
  framing that rejects not just the science, but what is plainly evident if you
  look out your window,” said Mann. The authors also write that ocean
  acidification is occurring “within the range of natural variability” and is
  beneficial for marine life despite indications that by the end of this
  century, the ocean’s acidic levels could reach the highest since 14m years
  ago, a time when a major extinction event was occurring. And the report
  references the apparent health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which it
  says “has shown considerable growth in recent years”. The reef was recently
  hit by its sixth mass bleaching event since 2016, a devastating phenomenon for
  corals in which they whiten and sometimes die due to high sea temperatures. No
  widespread bleaching events were recorded on the reef before 1998. The report
  is “tedious” and at times “truly wearisome”, according to Bob Kopp, a climate
  scientist at Rutgers University. Kopp recently worked on a paper showing how
  rising temperatures and drought will worsen crop yields, counter to the
  report’s claims that crops will flourish with extra carbon dioxide in the
  atmosphere. “Carbon dioxide fertilization is largely irrelevant to how
  increasingly extreme heat and intense drought will impact crop yields,” Kopp
  said. “As a former department of energy fellow, I’m embarrassed by this
  report.” • This article was amended on 4 August 2025 because an earlier
  version was wrong to say that the ocean’s acidic levels are currently the
  highest since 14m years ago. Estimates indicate that those acidic levels could
  be reached by the end of this century.
