  Moon jellyfish Moon jellyfish are the most common species in UK seas, easily
  identified by its markings of four purple circles within its translucent white
  bell. The bell has a layer of mucus over it, which the moon jellyfish uses to
  catch plankton, which it inserts into its mouth using special tentacles. Nasa
  launched more than 2,478 young moon jellyfish in a container into space in
  1991 to study the effects of microgravity on the gravity-sensitive organs of
  the species. Although they did not reach the moon, scientists discovered that
  the space-born jellyfish had difficulty swimming in Earth’s gravity, as their
  nervous system had adapted too well to microgravity. Lion’s mane The largest
  species of jellyfish in the world is the lion’s mane, which gets its name from
  its up to 3-metre-long, hair-like tentacles that look like, yes, a lion’s
  mane. These reddish-brown tentacles are packed with stinging cells and are
  used to prey upon fish and smaller jellyfish. The largest recorded lion’s mane
  specimen was found off the coast of Massachusetts, US, in 1865. It had a bell
  diameter of 210cm and tentacles measuring about 36.6 metres long. Although not
  fatal, the sting of a lion’s mane jellyfish can cause serious discomfort to a
  person, from localised redness and pain to vomiting and chest pain. A
  34-year-old woman was taken to hospital in 2016 after suffering an allergic
  reaction from the sting of six lion’s mane jellyfish. Barrel jellyfish Another
  large species to look out for is the barrel jellyfish, with a bell diameter of
  as much as 90cm and which weigh as much as 35kg. They have eight frilly
  tentacles and, due to their enormous size, are often found washed up on
  beaches after searching for prey in shallow waters. Fish and small crabs are
  known to seek shelter within the tentacles of the barrel specimen, as a safe
  space from predators. The sting of a barrel jellyfish is typically mild and
  does not cause real harm to people. Countries across the world and
  particularly in south-east Asia have eaten barrel jellyfish for more than
  1,700 years. Mauve stinger The mauve stinger is a small and beautiful
  jellyfish, typically coloured pink, purple or a bluey purple, and packs a
  punch with its 3-metre long tentacles full of stinging cells. The mauve
  stinger has one of the worst stings of all the species and can glow brightly
  at night when disturbed, giving it the scientific name Pelagia noctiluca,
  which translates to “night-light of the sea”. Compass jellyfish A common
  summer visitor to the UK is the compass jellyfish, named for its brown lined
  markings running down the centre of its yellowish-white bell that resemble a
  compass. When the compass jellyfish stings something, it often detaches a
  tentacle and leaves it behind, which can still sting despite not being
  connected to a body. The species, frequently encountered in Cornish coastal
  waters, can inflict a lot of pain from its sting, which should be rinsed with
  warm water for 30 minutes to reduce the pain. Crystal jellyfish The nearly
  transparent and bioluminescent crystal jellyfish can emit light and exhibit a
  bright green light when exposed to light ranging from blue to ultraviolet.
  With up to 150 tentacles, this unique jelly is often used in scientific
  experiments for its bioluminescent properties and proteins, which have
  revolutionised fields such as cell biology, neuroscience and disease research.
  Their sting is considered not strong enough to penetrate through human skin
  and cause harm, but is strong enough to harm and paralyse their prey in the
  water. Blue jellyfish The blue jellyfish, similar in shape to the lion’s mane
  species, can be colourless when young and develop its blue-purple bell once
  mature. This species can have up to 800 fine tentacles that resemble a head of
  hair; the jellyfish uses these tentacles to direct food – including other
  jellyfish – towards its mouth. The venom from a blue jellyfish sting can cause
  serious pain, which can last for hours or even days. Although the sting is
  nonlethal, it can be potentially dangerous for young children, elderly people,
  and those with allergies such as anaphylaxis.
