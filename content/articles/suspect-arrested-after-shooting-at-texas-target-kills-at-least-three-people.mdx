  A gunman opened fire outside a Target store in Austin, Texas, on Monday,
  killing at least three people and injuring a fourth. The suspect, who fled the
  scene in a stolen car, is in police custody according to local officials. The
  name of the shooter has not been released, but was identified as a white
  32-year-old man with a history of mental health issues, said the Austin police
  chief, Lisa Davis. An investigation into what unfolded in the Target parking
  lot and what may have contributed to this act of violence is still underway.
  Mental illness by itself is not a predictor of violence and only 5% shooting
  deaths in the US are committed by people with mental health disabilities,
  according to research from Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry.
  “This is a devastating situation, and my heart is with the victims and their
  families,” Kirk Watson, Austin’s mayor, said in a social media post. “While
  this remains an active and ongoing investigation, what I’ll say is that this
  was a sickening, cowardly act of gun violence.” The man, who authorities said
  had previously been placed on emergency detention holds due to his mental
  health, stole a succession of cars after the attack. The driver of the first
  car was reported to be one of the gunshot victims. After wrecking the first
  car, he stole another before being captured in south Austin after exiting the
  vehicle. He was tased by officers and was taken into custody, Davis said
  during a news conference. Police were called at 2.15pm local time and arrived
  within four minutes, according to Davis. Responding officers found three
  people who had been fatally shot in the Target parking lot. An Austin-Travis
  county emergency services spokesperson said first responders treated one
  person for unrelated injuries. “This is a very sad day for Austin. It’s a very
  sad day for us all and my condolences go out to the families,” she said. no
  information has been released about the victims and no motive has been
  identified. The shooting came amid back-to-school shopping ahead of the
  upcoming school year. “We are devastated by the violence that occurred today
  at our store in Austin, Texas,” a spokesperson for Target Corporate said in an
  emailed statement issued to the Guardian. The company added that they are
  working with law enforcement to support their investigation and will also
  provide grief counseling and other resources to employees. “Our hearts are
  with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives, our team in
  Austin and all those impacted by this tragedy.”
