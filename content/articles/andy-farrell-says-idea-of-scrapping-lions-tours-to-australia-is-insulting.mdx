  Andy Farrell has described suggestions the Wallabies are not worthy opponents
  of the British &amp; Irish Lions as “insulting” and believes it would be a
  mistake to scrap tours of Australia. The Lions can wrap up their first clean
  sweep since 1927 if they beat the Wallabies in Saturday’s third Test in Sydney
  and become the first Lions side to go unbeaten since 1974. The Lions have
  already made history by becoming the first touring side to clinch a second
  straight series win over the same opponent and are odds-on favourites to
  secure a 3-0 whitewash. The Wallabies are languishing at sixth in the world
  rankings and although they came within 50 seconds of levelling the series in
  Melbourne were well beaten in the Brisbane opener. The six warm-up victories
  have been largely one-sided – the five-point win over the First Nations &amp;
  Pasifika XV notwithstanding – raising questions as to whether the Lions should
  continue to tour Australia or seek different opponents, such as France or
  Argentina. The French federation vice-president Abdel Benazzi said this month
  that he intended to discuss a “new business model” with the Lions. Benazzi was
  adamant he did not want to do so at the expense of Australia, but Sir Clive
  Woodward, who coached the Lions in 2005, and Brian Moore, who featured on two
  tours, have said consideration should be given to scheduling different
  opponents. Australia’s head coach, Joe Schmidt, chose not to release a number
  of his players to feature in the warm-up games and this provided more
  ammunition. The 2029 tour of New Zealand is all but signed off, but there is
  no agreement in place over future tours. The Lions captain, Maro Itoje, said
  on Tuesday that his preference would be to stick with the traditional
  opponents and on Thursday Farrell said: “I don’t think [touring Australia] was
  ever off the agenda. Every single team, country, province, has their ups and
  downs, but Australia – the sporting nation they are – are always going to come
  back. “That [performance last] weekend is no surprise to us and why we expect
  them to be better. Have a look at the year they’ve got coming up. They’re
  going to be a force to be reckoned with, 100%, with all their experiences,
  come the World Cup in 2027 [in Australia]. “Hopefully, [this tour] will be
  remembered for the type of rugby we played and the way that we went about it.
  We came here and wanted to win a series. We’ve achieved that, but we have a
  massive responsibility to make sure we finish this off with something we
  promised ourselves with. “It’s a big ask, but it’s something that we’re
  determined to do. [Winning 3-0 is] something we’ve talked about from day one
  and we’ve put ourselves in a position to put that on the line, so that’s why
  it means so much to us.” Despite already securing the series, Farrell has
  resisted making wholesale changes for the final Test with just two to the
  starting lineup. Blair Kinghorn replaces James Lowe on the left wing while
  James Ryan comes in at second-row. Ollie Chessum drops to a 6-2 bench that
  includes Jac Morgan and Ben Earl. Morgan’s clearout on Carlo Tizzano in the
  buildup to Hugo Keenan’s last-minute try last week has been hotly debated with
  the Wallabies adamant the score ought to have been chalked off. Tizzano, for
  his part, has been accused of playacting, but Schmidt revealed on Thursday
  that the clearout registered a force of 54G. Schmidt has chosen to omit the
  flanker for the third Test and said “he’s copped a lot of online abuse”.
  Farrell, who lashed out when his son Owen was targeted after his red card
  against Wales in a 2023 World Cup warm-up match, said: “Online abuse is clear
  and obvious. It’s disgusting. It shouldn’t be that way.”
