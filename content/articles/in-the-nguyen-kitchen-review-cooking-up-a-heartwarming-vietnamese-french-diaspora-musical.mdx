  In the Nguyen Kitchen review – cooking up a heartwarming Vietnamese-French
  diaspora musical

  Paris is home to one of the oldest and largest Vietnamese diasporas in the
  world – not that you could tell from mainstream French cinema. In this
  heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to the magic of the
  musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the struggles of
  Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen on screen. A
  hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier) can’t help
  but dream in songs. Her candy-coloured reveries unfold like a Jacques Demy
  fantasy, bursting with tunes and light. In reality, however, she is stuck
  belting out jingles for spring rolls to indifferent supermarket customers.
  Without much luck getting cast in acting roles, Yvonne moves back in with her
  mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant in the outskirts of Paris.
  Generational clashes soon follow, but so does a too-good-to-be-true
  opportunity to star in a big-budget musical. While Yvonne’s mother scolds her
  for not being Vietnamese enough, the role she is offered – Lotus Flower, an
  exotic Asian mistress – ironically demands that Nguyen play up cliche
  stereotypes. This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in an industry
  where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Ly-Cuong approaches
  these issues with a winking humour and playfulness; the song sequences are a
  delight, but the beautiful chemistry between Chevalier and Tran-Nghia shines
  even more brightly. Here, music does not exist solely on stage, or in the
  rehearsal room; as Yvonne and her mother bond over cooking in a moving ritual
  of cultural inheritance, the sounds of clanking utensils and sizzling woks
  harmonise into a pleasing symphony. Against the cacophony of self-doubt and
  societal prejudices, it is this music of love and care that allows Yvonne to
  eventually dance to the beat of her own drum. • In the Nguyen Kitchen is in UK
  cinemas from 29 August
