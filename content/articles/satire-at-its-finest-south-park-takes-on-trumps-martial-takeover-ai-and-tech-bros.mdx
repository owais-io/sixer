  Early on in its 27th season, South Park has garnered more controversy than it
  has in years (possibly ever), along with some of its highest ratings. Last
  week’s episode took aim at the Trump administration’s brutal Immigrations and
  Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids, poked fun at homeland security secretary
  Kristi Noem’s penchant for puppy murder and cosmetic surgery (Noem has since
  climbed atop her moral high horse and accused the show of sexism) and, of
  course, Donald Trump himself. Along with Trump’s martial takeover of
  Washington DC, this week’s instalment, titled Sickofancy, takes aim at
  artificial intelligence (specifically ChatGPT) and the larger tech-bro
  industry. Picking up where we last left off, the show’s resident doofus, Randy
  Marsh, sees his beloved Tegridy Weed marijuana farm raided by border patrol
  agents. They kidnap all of his workers (“Hey! Those are my Mexicans!”),
  leaving him with only one employee, the ever-stoned Towelie (a talking bath
  towel, naturally). Despondent, Randy turns to ChatGPT for advice. The
  sycophantic, soft-voiced app draws up a new business plan for him and Towelie
  to implement. With the help of a single Mexican whom they spring from an Ice
  detention centre and plenty of recreational ketamine, they rebrand to
  Techridy, “an AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions”. Meanwhile,
  in Washington, President Trump takes a break from receiving lavish gifts (as
  well as assurances that “you do not have a small penis”) from politicians,
  business titans and foreign leaders to remake the capital into a dystopian
  police state festooned with his own image (which includes his
  less-than-impressive member). The two storylines converge when Randy attempts
  to bribe Trump into legalising marijuana nationwide by bequeathing Towelie to
  him. It’s all for naught, though, as ChatGPT’s advice proves useless and he
  ends up having to sell Tegridy Farms and move his family back to the suburbs
  (the end of an era for the show, which has heavily featured this subplot for
  seven years, much to the annoyance of some fans). Parker and Stone’s take on
  AI – that it is dumbing us down, robbing us of person-to-person connection and
  giving us really, really bad advice – is refreshingly clear-eyed, if not
  particularly incendiary. The larger skewering of tech bros is solid, although
  it’s slightly disappointing that Elon Musk never gets brought in for any of
  it, even though the running gag about ketamine addiction is clearly aimed at
  him. That said, the digs at Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta founder Mark
  Zuckerberg help fill that gap. The Trump material remains roundly funny and
  it’s clear the show is building to a big conclusion, most likely involving his
  unwilling partner and lover Satan (who is finally taking steps to free himself
  from the abusive relationship). This episode is unlikely to cause as big a
  stir as the previous two. But watching South Park satirise the horrifying
  militarisation of Washington DC in real time – Union Station, which features
  in the show’s central montage, was the scene of a fascist photo op featuring
  vice-president JD Vance, defence secretary Pete Hegseth and White House deputy
  chief of staff Stephen Miller – is another reminder that no show has ever
  worked harder to have its finger on the nation’s pulse.
