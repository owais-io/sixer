  What began with a large bamboo ring wrapped in brown paper and posted across
  the Pacific to an Australian war bride in the US launched what became one of
  the world’s greatest fads of the late-1950s – the hula hoop. But Joan
  Anderson, the parcel’s recipient and the woman who delivered the concept of
  the hoop to America, was left out of the loop – ignored by the toy company
  that sold more than 100m hula hoops before the fad was replaced. It was not
  until 2018 that Anderson, who died on 14 July aged 101, was credited for her
  role in introducing the hula hoop after her story was shared in the short
  documentary film Hula Girl. The film provided Anderson the opportunity to tell
  her side of a story that involved the thrill of innovation quickly followed by
  the ache of betrayal and the worth of a “gentleman’s handshake”. In 1956,
  while on a return visit to her home town of Sydney, Anderson noticed how many
  people were having fun with large bamboo hoops, wriggling them around their
  waists and shimmying their hips like Elvis Presley. “Everywhere I would go,
  everybody was giggling and carrying on and when I asked what was going on they
  said, ‘Oh, everyone’s doing the hoop,’” she said. The joy was contagious, and
  upon her return to the US where she was living, she told her husband, Wayne,
  about it. He wanted to see one of these hoops, so Anderson’s mother posted one
  over, and during a dinner party demonstration of the hoop, after a guest
  compared Anderson’s moves to those of a hula dancer, the name hula hoop was
  born. “There are so many stories about where the name came from, and they are
  all fictitious,” Anderson said in the film. “This is the true story about it.”
  Realising its potential as a toy product, the Andersons contacted an associate
  of Wayne’s named Arthur “Spud” Melin, the founder of the Wham-O toy company,
  whose instincts they trusted. They met in the company’s parking lot. “There
  were no witnesses; just Spud, my husband and myself,” Anderson recalled. “We
  told him we’ve called it the hula hoop, and he thought that was a great name
  for it.” Melin was intrigued and, as he and Wayne shook hands, he assured the
  Andersons that if the hula hoop made money for him, it would make money for
  them too. By 1958, as the popularity of the hoops – now patented, plastic and
  produced by Wham-O – escalated and, with sales exceeding US$30m in two months,
  the Andersons’ phone calls remained unanswered, messages not returned. The
  only credit given to Joan Anderson was as the “friend from Australia” who had
  inspired Melin. “I think that bugged me more than anything,” Anderson said. “I
  was not a ‘friend’.” Joan Constance Manning was born in Sydney on 28 December
  1923 to Claude and Ethel Manning. After leaving school at 14, she began
  modelling, with ambitions to become a film star. She was a diminutive figure,
  just over five feet tall, and was nicknamed the Pocket Venus. In December
  1941, Joan was the cover girl of Pix magazine and was declared to be “a
  typical Australian holiday girl” whose war work included knitting socks and
  writing letters. She received a picture of herself from troops at Tobruk who
  wrote, “you make us forget Libya”. While swimming at Bondi beach in 1945, Joan
  was approached by US Army Air corps P-38 pilot Wayne Anderson, who did not
  make an impression until she saw him that night at a dance in his uniform.
  Four months later, they were married and, in early 1946, she joined hundreds
  of other war brides on their journey to America. In 1961, the Andersons filed
  a lawsuit against the Wham-O toy company and eventually settled with a small
  amount of compensation. “Why be angry with something you can’t change? The
  world isn’t fair but life goes on. I had a great life,” Joan Anderson said.
  “My husband lived to be 87 and we had 63 wonderful years together. Happiness
  is the best revenge.” She and Wayne had four children: Warren, Gary, Carl and
  Loralyn, three of whom survive her. Wayne died in 2007. Despite the hula hoop
  disappointment, the Anderson children all had hoops as they grew up. “It was
  never a big deal in our family. [My parents] went on with their lives. They
  knew they messed up with the business deal,” Loralyn Willis said. Somalian
  Australian circus artist Marawa, an inductee of the Guinness World Record Hall
  of Fame for her hooping prowess, met Anderson in 2018 and was struck by her
  grace over her lost business opportunity. “If I can be like Joan when I am 100
  then I’ll be happy,” she said. “Meeting her made me realise I’ve made the
  right career choice for a long life.” Willis said her mother was “fun-loving,
  adventurous and willing to try anything”. She was ziplining, parasailing and
  boogie-boarding with her grandchildren until her mid-90s. “Mom was pretty
  happy that she got the recognition in the end and that she was able to bring
  so much joy to people around the world,” she said. “How can you hula hoop
  without being happy?”
