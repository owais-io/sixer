  Britain’s jobs market is in a challenging position. Job losses are rising,
  fewer employers are advertising for staff, and the resurgence of inflation is
  eroding the value of workers’ pay. For Rachel Reeves this is bad news. The
  latest figures showing a decline in the number of employees on company
  payrolls in July, alongside a slowdown in annual wage growth in the three
  months to June, underscore the challenge facing the chancellor. Having made
  rebooting the economy the No 1 priority of a Labour government, the evidence a
  year in is hardly encouraging. Employers cut headcount by 8,000 last month.
  Since the general election in July last year, the number of employees on
  company payrolls has collapsed by 164,000. The official headline unemployment
  rate remained stuck at 4.7% in the three months to June, above the 4.2% level
  Reeves inherited a year ago, at the highest rate since 2021. Economists blame
  two things in particular: a weak economic outlook, and the chancellor’s £25bn
  rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) announced at her
  first autumn budget in October last year and implemented in April. Tuesday’s
  figures showed job losses have been concentrated most in the retail and
  hospitality sectors, which as heavier users of part-time and flexible
  contracts, lower pay and seasonal work, are among the most exposed to the
  rising costs of employment. Hiring intentions have fallen to record lows as
  the uncertainty facing the UK economy has risen, and as employers face
  pressures from Donald Trump’s trade war, sluggish consumer spending, lingering
  inflation and elevated interest rates. Faced with this outlook, the Bank of
  England had little option but to reduce borrowing costs to 4% last week.
  However, it warned that inflationary pressures were rekindling, which could
  delay the timing of a further cut. For workers, the re-emergence of a period
  of high inflation – forecast to reach a renewed peak of 4% by September – will
  erode the real-terms value of their average pay settlements. Resilience in
  average earnings growth, despite the economic uncertainty, has puzzled some
  analysts, including the Bank. However, the crossover point where inflation
  overtakes average annual pay is looming. The Bank’s network of agents reckon
  pay growth will slow in the coming quarters, to about 3.75% by the end of the
  year. The latest figures for the three months to June put annual growth in
  real terms at 1.5% for regular pay and 1.1% for total pay, including bonuses.
  Wage growth is likely to weaken further over the coming months, in a renewed
  squeeze on households. Despite this, there are some crumbs of comfort. The hit
  from the NICs increase is now likely to have passed the point of most pain for
  employers. While the fallout is clear, and job losses have risen, they have
  not rocketed. Economists point to the number of HR1 advanced redundancy
  notifications, which firms are required to submit to the government if they
  plan to cut staff, remaining relatively subdued in July. Although the labour
  market is cooling, it is doing so at a relatively gradual pace. This is a
  slowdown, not the collapse predicted by the most vocal employers’ groups. For
  the Bank, that pace of change is among the reasons why its policymakers are
  taking a careful and gradual approach to cutting interest rates any further.
  For the chancellor, it also shows why her autumn budget will need to be
  carefully calibrated to prevent a deeper hit to workers.
