  Nottingham Forest will host a rerun of their 1979 European Cup final win over
  Malmö on their return to continental action after 30 years away. The Swedish
  champions will visit the City Ground for one of Forest’s eight Europa League
  ties, evoking memories of Trevor Francis’s winning goal in the first of their
  back-to-back European titles. It is the standout fixture in a draw whose
  buildup was peppered with controversy. Forest are competing on this stage only
  after swapping places with Crystal Palace, who were demoted to the Conference
  League after being ruled to have breached multi-club ownership rules. “We have
  promised we need to be where we belong and that is the Premier League and
  European competitions,” the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, said. The Greek
  businessman was sitting a matter of yards from the Palace co-owner, Steve
  Parish, during the draw ceremony but the pair did not appear to exchange
  words. Forest are competing in Europe for the first time since a Uefa Cup
  campaign in 1995-96 that coincidentally brought two further meetings with
  Malmö in a two-legged first round tie, which Forest won on away goals. This
  time they will also welcome Porto, Ferencvaros and Midtjylland to the City
  Ground. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side will travel to Real Betis, Braga, Sturm
  Graz and Utrecht. Aston Villa are England’s other Europa League contenders
  and, under the four-time winner Unai Emery, will feel confident of navigating
  a smooth path to the knockout phase. A home tie against Maccabi Tel Aviv may,
  however, provide the club with a logistical headache. Maccabi will be the
  first Israeli club to play in England since the attacks of 7 October 2023,
  which triggered war in Gaza. Recent European trips involving Maccabi include a
  match at Ajax last November that sparked serious violence and unrest in
  Amsterdam. The other visitors to Villa Park will be Red Bull Salzburg, Young
  Boys and Bologna. Villa will travel to face Robin van Persie’s Feyenoord,
  Basel, Go Ahead Eagles and a José Mourinho-less Fenerbahce. Conference League
  football means Palace, who squeezed through their playoff with Frederikstad on
  Thursday night, will play six league stage matches rather than eight. A short
  trip to Dublin to face Shelbourne will have novelty value, while their away
  game with Dynamo Kyiv is likely to be held in the Polish city Lublin owing to
  continued restrictions on matches being held in Ukraine. They will also visit
  Strasbourg, who share an owner with Chelsea in the form of BlueCo. Selhurst
  Park will play host to AZ Alkmaar, the Finnish side KuPS and the Cypriot club
  AEK Larnaca. Rangers and Celtic will compete in the Europa League after costly
  Champions League playoff defeats. Russell Martin’s Gers will host Roma, Braga,
  Ludogorets and Genk; they will meet Porto, Ferencvaros, Sturm Graz and Brann
  away from home. Celtic and Brendan Rodgers will welcome Roma, Sturm Graz,
  Utrecht and Braga to Glasgow; they will visit Feyenoord, Crvena Zvezda,
  Midtjylland and Bologna. A home meeting with Shakhtar Donetsk was the
  highlight of Aberdeen’s Conference League draw. The dates and order of both
  competitions’ ties are expected to be confirmed by Sunday.
