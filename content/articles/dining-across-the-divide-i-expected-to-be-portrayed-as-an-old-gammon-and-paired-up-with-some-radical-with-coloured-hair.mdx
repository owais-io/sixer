  Cushla, 49, London Occupation Works in software Voting record Cushla, who came
  to the UK from New Zealand in 1999, voted Labour in the last election.
  Describes herself as centre-left Amuse bouche Was the singer in a band in the
  90s. She describes them as “Enigma remixed by Einstürzende Neubauten” Martin,
  66, London Occupation Retired photographer Voting record Reform in the last
  election, probably Reform in the next. Describes himself as right-of-centre
  Amuse bouche Martin once told the then Prince Charles an anecdote about an
  encounter with Liam Gallagher in a nightclub toilet. The future king was
  “completely bemused” For starters Martin I was expecting the Guardian to
  portray me as an old gammon and pair me up with some radical with coloured
  hair. Then she walked through the door with blue hair, which was rather
  amusing! She was lovely from the outset – friendly and interesting. We started
  with some shredded prawn rolls and deep-fried lotus root. Cushla We were both
  a little wary. I decided to set him at ease by saying: “Don’t worry, my
  partner voted for Brexit.” He said: “Why are you here, then? You dine across
  the divide every evening!” I was expecting a grumpy old man. You can create a
  two-dimensional stereotype in your brain, and Martin wasn’t that. The place
  was lovely. The big beef Martin I have seen a significant change in crime and
  general disorder even in the last couple of years – people jumping the
  barriers in the tube, shoplifting, phone-snatching, seemingly without
  repercussions. To get a grip on crime, you need to start tackling it at the
  lower level, otherwise people start thinking they can get away with it. Cushla
  Martin is training to become a magistrate and talked about his experience of
  watching people come in and out of court. I think he’s far more in favour of
  imprisonment. I countered by saying: let’s look at doing more restorative
  justice – giving offenders the chance to really encounter the impact of their
  crimes. Martin Some people who break the law, generally more white-collar
  criminals, are not best served by prison. But for severe crimes – violent,
  sexual – I think people should be kept in a lot longer than they are, away
  from society. It requires more cross-party planning, though. Investing in a
  prison is a 10- or 15-year project; governments don’t want to put money into
  that because they’ll be out of power by the time the prison is built. Cushla I
  think I would be a different kind of magistrate, but I say that from a
  position of hopeful naivety. I know the justice system is broken, that there
  is insufficient money. Sharing plate Martin We shared how much we despised the
  Tory government after 14 years of incompetence and were incredulous that the
  Labour party think the way to make things better is to cut disability payments
  and not revoke the two-child benefit cap. Cushla It surprised me that we
  agreed that the cap should be removed. When you’re poor, you’re poor, and the
  early stages are when the most good – and most damage – can be done. For
  afters Martin Governments across all political parties have consistently
  promised to tackle illegal immigration and completely failed to do so. It’s a
  cliche, but you’re letting people into your house without knowing who they
  are. I’d favour some kind of holding and assessment system – more like the
  solution Australia came up with where they housed everyone on an island while
  they processed their applications and determined who should be let in and who
  shouldn’t. Cushla I’m frustrated by the tag “illegal”. People are not born
  “illegal”; we’re creating the conditions for them to become so. I came here on
  an ancestry visa so I am “legal” by an accident of birth. What makes my
  accident of birth any better or worse than someone else’s? And given the UK’s
  history in the world, the UK does actually have a very particular moral
  obligation, whether it likes it or not. Takeaways Martin It was great to meet
  someone with different views but also to be able to have a conversation,
  rather than just throw opinions at each other. I think it’s society that
  demands we take extreme positions, and really, we’re not far away from each
  other in what we think. Cushla When people think differently you don’t tend to
  hear why or get the opportunity to actually challenge your own thinking. What
  this has taught me is you have to listen to rather than talk. Additional
