  For a goalkeeper under pressure, there’s one safe way out: turn away from the
  opponent, shield the ball with your body and boot it long. A few minutes into
  the second half against Nashville last weekend, Pablo Sisniega did the exact
  opposite. San Diego FC’s backup goalkeeper trapped a bouncing pass with his
  sole so that the ball dangled out in front of him like a fisher’s lure, then
  waited flat-footed outside his box while Major League Soccer’s joint-leading
  scorer Sam Surridge hurtled toward him. At one second to impact, Sisniega held
  out his hand and beckoned to his 20-year-old center back Manu Duah: come
  closer. A minute later, the newest – and riskiest – team in MLS had scored a
  winning goal. “Talk is cheap, I understand that,” San Diego’s head coach Mike
  Varas said when he was hired last year, before the expansion side had held a
  training session or even signed most of its squad, “but we’re going to be
  brave to play. When teams come to press us, we’re going to find solutions
  under the press.” True to his promise, Varas’s goalkeepers have refused to
  play it safe this season, launching just 8.6 percent of their open-play passes
  more than 40 yards. According to the stats site FBref, that’s not just an MLS
  record – it’s lower than Barcelona, Man City or any other team in Europe’s top
  five leagues going back at least as far as 2017-18. Like most leagues around
  the world, MLS is in the midst of a buildup boom. Phase of play data from the
  new live score app Futi, which I co-founded, shows the league taking 257
  touches per game this season in the buildup, a phase defined approximately as
  controlled open-play possession in a team’s defensive half. That number has
  nearly doubled from 138 ten years ago. Still, no one in MLS comes close to San
  Diego’s 367 buildup touches per game in 2025. By some measures, they’re more
  committed to playing out of the back than any team on record. From a distance,
  San Diego’s style looks like a natural continuation of soccer’s decades-long
  arc toward more buildup play against increasingly disciplined high presses, a
  history written by the coaches Varas admires: Pep Guardiola, sure, but also
  Marcelo Bielsa, Maurizio Sarri, Roberto De Zerbi, Luis Enrique. “So many, so
  many,” he says. “I mean, I’m a football junkie.” But while those managers work
  with the best players in the world, San Diego started their very first
  preseason six months ago with a group of “30 strangers,” as Nashville’s head
  coach BJ Callaghan put it before last weekend’s game. For most MLS expansion
  teams, throwing together a team on a budget under byzantine roster rules means
  settling for a pragmatic playing style or none at all. At San Diego, the style
  came first. The club belongs to a network called Right to Dream, which began
  as a youth academy in Ghana, grew to include Denmark’s FC Nordsjaelland, and
  was bought by Egypt’s Mansour Group in 2021. The organization won an MLS
  expansion bid with San Diego to form a multi-club ownership group along with
  Egyptian women’s team FC Masar. As part of its focus on youth development, the
  group has developed a distinctive style of play that emphasizes attracting
  pressure and playing quickly through tight spaces in the center of the pitch.
  “The idea is, how can we get the opponent to be attracted to the ball, to
  start to release and jump forward,” Varas said, “and then how do we recognize
  that moment and accelerate the play through them, around them or over them,
  depending on how they jump?” San Diego take specific risks to trigger the
  opponent’s high press, such as exchanging short “repeating passes” with a
  player facing away from goal or sending the ball back to the goalkeeper and
  then sideways or even backwards to a center back who drops all the way to the
  goalline. You can see both tactics in a plot of buildup pass types that the
  team attempts more than other MLS sides. “Of course, the point is not to play
  passes back there. The point is to beat the opponent’s press, right?” Varas
  said. The payoff for these risky passes comes when San Diego can play out of
  pressure and find what they call a “breakthrough,” running downhill between
  the lines with the ball at the feet of their star wingers, Anders Dreyer and
  Hirving Lozano. Futi’s data shows that San Diego spend more time in the fast
  break phase of play than any team in the league, edging out Lionel Messi’s
  Inter Miami. To get there, though, they have to roll the dice on inexperienced
  players. The makeshift back four that beat Nashville averaged just 20 years
  old, almost certainly the youngest starting back line in MLS history. Even at
  full strength, San Diego rely on a rookie goalkeeper and two teenage
  fullbacks, a consequence of MLS rules that encourage teams to spend big on
  attackers and skimp at the back. “It was pretty interesting sitting in some of
  these Right to Dream meetings,” San Diego’s 33-year-old sporting director
  Tyler Heaps said, “explaining to them, ‘Look, we’re taking even more risk in
  MLS because we’re building up with our lowest-paid players against everybody’s
  highest-paid players, and we’re not giving the ball to our highest-paid
  players until it’s time to score goals.’” The key to finding bargains at the
  back was starting from Right to Dream’s style and role profiles. “We challenge
  our scouts not to watch exactly what the player is doing, but to try to find
  traits that exemplify what we want to do,” Heaps said. He used the example of
  the club’s just-turned 19-year-old left back, who joined from the
  developmental league MLS Next Pro. “Luca Bombino, in LAFC 2, was not playing
  the way that we played. But we saw a player that was very good in terms of
  solving situations under pressure.” Bombino has since thrived enough to
  reportedly attract a bid from West Brom, which was rejected. It helps that
  Heaps and Varas both worked for years at the US Soccer Federation, building a
  network of youth national team contacts who shared a love of buildup play.
  This summer San Diego have signed one teenage American after another, making
  up for the nascent club’s lack of academy players by collecting future USMNT
  prospects like Infinity Stones. “I’m not saying that I want the national team
  to play this exact way because I think in international football, it might be
  too risky,” Heaps said. “But I think a lot of the skills that we are teaching
  our players will help any team.” So far the risk-taking is paying off for San
  Diego, who sit top of the MLS Western Conference and are on pace to be the
  best expansion side in league history. “In our style of play, because we put
  the players in such uncomfortable positions, I think we develop quite brave
  players, right?” Varas said. “They have to solve a lot of tough situations.
  That helps develop players for the highest level.”
