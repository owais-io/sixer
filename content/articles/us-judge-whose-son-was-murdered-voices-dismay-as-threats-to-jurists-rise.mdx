  A judge whose son was murdered by a disgruntled lawyer posing as a pizza
  deliveryman voiced anguish that the crime has spawned a spate of copycat
  threats against other jurists. Esther Salas, a US district judge for New
  Jersey, fought back tears on Thursday after being asked to respond to a trend
  of judges receiving home pizza deliveries with the name of her late son
  attached as a means of intimidation. Salas’s son, Daniel, then aged 20, was
  shot dead on his doorstep on 19 July 2020 by a man who had ostensibly been
  delivering a pizza to his family’s home. Her husband, Mark, survived critical
  injuries after being shot multiple times in the attack. The suspect, Den
  Hollander, an attorney who was subsequently found dead from a self-inflicted
  gunshot wound, had earlier appeared in Salas’s court in a case which he lost.
  “I’m probably a little more emotional today than ever, because we’re in July,”
  she told a webinar, titled Speak Up for Justice, discussing the rising tide of
  violent threats against judges. “July is a hard month because Daniel would
  have been 25 on July 13, and we celebrated his murder – not celebrated, had to
  endure the anniversary of his murder, his fifth anniversary, on July 19.”
  “Then to hear that my beautiful son’s name, everything that Danny stands for
  is love and light – and to hear people using it as a weapon, weaponizing his
  name to inflict fear,” she added. Thursday’s forum was held to address an
  intensifying atmosphere of menace and intimidation that judges describe facing
  since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. It included judges
  who had been threatened directly after ruling against some of Trump’s most
  contentious policies and executive orders. Several participants called the
  current hostile environment “unprecedented”. Salas was speaking after two
  fellow judges, John McConnell, a US district judge from Rhode Island, and
  Robert Lasnik, who sits on the western district of Washington, said they had
  both received pizzas in Daniel’s name. McConnell described receiving a
  threatening voice message calling for his assassination after arousing anger
  among Donald Trump’s supporters with a ruling that blocked the president’s
  attempt to freeze funding to states. The expletive-laden recording was played
  to the webinar. McConnell’s ruling led to articles being lodged in Congress
  calling for his impeachment. A wanted poster with his face and name on it was
  placed inside the US Capitol, apparently by a member of Congress. McConnell
  said his court had received about 400 or 500 “vile phone” calls following the
  ruling – which triggered a formal complaint by America First Legal, an
  advocacy group founded by Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller as
  well as six credible death threats. He was initially puzzled by the
  unexplained pizza deliveries until the US marshals, which protect members of
  the federal judiciary, explained it, prompting him to call Salas. “They wanted
  to let us know that they knew where we lived,” McConnell said. “The most
  devastating, the most heartbreaking call I’ve ever had to make was when the
  marshals called me and told me that a pizza had been delivered in … Daniel’s
  name. I didn’t want to make that call. But I called my friend Esther because I
  thought she needed to know what was going on and we had a good cry over it.”
  He added: “Someone was on the dark web, searching for my home address, because
  - this a quote, ‘He wanted Smith and Wesson to pay me a visit at my home.’”
  Lasnik said pizzas had been delivered to his home in Seattle while two of his
  adult children, who live in different cities, had also received deliveries –
  all in Salas’s son’s name – after he went on national media to criticize the
  climate of intimidation aimed at judges. “What’s the message to Judge Lasnik?
  We know where you live. We know where your children live and they could end up
  dead just like Judge Salas’s son. That’s a pretty cruel thing to do.” Pizzas
  had been sent to “upwards of 50” judges, he told the forum. Referring to the
  threats against judges generally, he said: “They would make a ruling, they
  would be bombarded with hate mail and hate emails and threats. And it’s so
  discouraging to a young judge to suddenly not only worry about, how do I do
  this job, right, but how do I keep my family safe?” John Coughenour, also a
  judge from Washington and who issued a preliminary injunction against Trump’s
  executive order limiting birthright citizenship, described how local sheriff’s
  officers arrived at his home with weapons drawn following a “swatting” call
  falsely stating he had murdered his wife. John Roberts, the chief justice of
  the US supreme court, has twice spoken out against threats against judges in
  recent months, warning that it was undermining the rule of law. He warned
  against the trend in his end of year report in 2024, and reiterated it at a
  forum in North Carolina last month, voicing fears that it could lead to
  violence. While there have been past criticisms of Democratic rhetoric against
  rulings – notably against Chuck Schumer, the party’s leader in the Senate –
  Trump and his supporters have raised the ante since his inauguration in
  January. Judges have been repeatedly assailed as “radical”, “Marxists”, or
  faced calls for their impeachment over rulings that stymied administration
  policies. Salas said the current climate went beyond previous threat levels.
  “We’ve seen it come from both sides, but now it’s at a level that I have to
  honestly say … is different,” she said. “We’re seeing things coming out from
  the top down, from White House spokespeople calling us crazy leftist,
  unconstitutional judges. That’s the difference. We are non-partisan, but we
  have to speak the facts. “And the facts are that we have political leaders
  with large social platforms, with power calling us deranged and idiots. It’s
  wrong whoever does it, whatever side you sit on.” Additional reporting by Sam
