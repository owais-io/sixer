  Democrats harshly criticized Donald Trump and Republicans after a US senator
  said the FBI had agreed to assist in locating Texas Democratic lawmakers who
  left the state to block Republicans from enacting a gerrymandered
  congressional map that would likely add five more Republican seats before next
  year’s midterm elections. Senator John Cornyn’s claim that the FBI would
  assist Republicans’ effort could not be independently confirmed. The FBI
  declined to comment. An administration official told NBC News this week the
  government did not plan on using federal agents to arrest Texas lawmakers and
  a federal law enforcement official told the outlet that as of Thursday
  morning, the agency had not assisted with trying to locate the lawmakers. None
  of the lawmakers have been charged with a crime. “Using federal law
  enforcement to track down political opposition is the tactic of a collapsing
  regime,” said the Texas state representative John Bucy, one of the lawmakers
  who is staying in Illinois. “It’s the kind of authoritarian overreach we
  condemn in other countries. Now, it’s happening here.” Involving federal
  agents would set up an extraordinary confrontation between the blue state
  leaders shielding the Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration.
  Speaking to reporters at the Illinois state fair on Thursday, the Democratic
  governor, JB Pritzker, said he welcomed the FBI to the state. “I hope they
  take in the state fair, I hope they go see the beauty of Lake Michigan. But
  they won’t be arresting anyone because there is no US federal law that
  prohibits those Texas house Democrats from being here in the state,” he told
  reporters. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the US House, called it
  an effort to intimidate Democrats. “Shouldn’t the FBI be tracking down
  terrorists, drug traffickers and child predators? The Trump administration
  continues to weaponize law enforcement to target political adversaries. These
  extremists don’t give a damn about public safety. We will not be intimidated,”
  he said in a post on X. Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National
  Committee, also accused Cornyn, who is locked in a primary battle against
  Texas’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, of grandstanding. “John Cornyn is
  desperately swinging for the fences, asking Kash Patel to take a break from
  covering up for Donald Trump to instead pull this political stunt. They both
  know damn well that legally, there’s nothing they can do,” he said. Legal
  experts have questioned how the federal law enforcement agency could play a
  role in returning the lawmakers. “Federal government intrusion into a state’s
  process of self-government should only occur when there is a clear
  constitutional warrant. In this situation, the federal government has no
  authority to intervene and no legitimate role to play,” said David Froomkin, a
  law professor at the University of Houston. In his request for assistance to
  the FBI earlier this week, Cornyn said he was “concerned that legislators who
  solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative
  duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses”. Trump
  also suggested earlier this week that the FBI might have to get involved in
  the matter. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has also launched a long-shot legal
  effort to get the top Democrat who left, Gene Wu, removed from office. Paxton,
  the Texas attorney general, also announced on Wednesday he had launched an
  investigation into a group run by former congressman Beto O’Rourke that has
  been covering the costs of Texas lawmakers as they remain in Illinois. Each
  lawmaker that breaks quorum is fined $500 per day. Also on Thursday, JD Vance
  met with Republican lawmakers in Indiana to encourage them to redraw the
  state’s congressional map to be more favorable to the GOP, the latest in a
  brazen nationwide push to reconfigure district lines ahead of next year’s
  midterm elections. Republicans already control seven of Indiana’s nine
  congressional seats, but the party has complete control of state government,
  which could allow them to redraw the map to pick up more seats. Donald Trump
  is also pushing Missouri to redraw its congressional map to add more GOP seats
  and Republicans in Ohio, where Republicans already control 10 of 15 districts,
  are also likely to reconfigure their map later this year to add more
  Republican seats. Vance met with Indiana’s Republican governor, Mike Braun,
  and state legislative leaders on Thursday. To redraw the maps in Indiana,
  Braun would need to call a special session. Republicans have an extremely slim
  margin in the US House and Democrats need to net just three seats to flip
  control of Congress next year. The president’s party typically loses US House
  seats in a midterm election, which is why Republicans are pushing to redraw
  districts in their favor. During a conference call on Thursday, two of four
  Texas lawmakers who had been scheduled to speak were delayed by taking a
  security briefing in light of the report of FBI involvement in the quorum
  break. Legislators deflected questions about the risk of a conflict between
  state and federal law enforcement, redirecting questions toward flooding
  relief and Abbott’s legislative and executive priorities. “We wouldn’t need to
  have a quorum break and wouldn’t need to be scared of the constitutional
  breakdown of states’ rights, and Illinois law enforcement versus the FBI, if
  we were focusing on the things that matter,” said the Texas representative
  Mary Gonzalez. “To me, the thing that matters most is that over 100 people
  died and that the homes are still destroyed and that people are still living
  in unsafe communities because there is debris.” The governors of California
  and New York, where Democrats have complete control of state government, have
  pledged to retaliate against Republicans’ redistricting efforts by adding
  Democratic seats, though both states face legal requirements that make
  aggressive gerrymandering more difficult. Additional reporting by George Chidi
