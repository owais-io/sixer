  Good morning. Humanitarians are running out of words to describe the horrors
  taking place in Gaza. The small strip of land has been brutalised, with all
  institutions that sustain life – from hospitals to schools – either completely
  destroyed or barely functioning. Now, the UN-backed Integrated Food Security
  Phase Classification (IPC) warns that “the worst-case scenario of famine is
  now unfolding in the Gaza Strip.” Thousands of children are malnourished and
  hunger-related deaths on the rise, particularly among the youngest. It is
  worth noting this is not a formal designation of famine in Gaza, and formal
  designations are incredibly rare and have only taken place a handful of times
  in the 21st century: in Somalia in 2011, in South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and
  in Sudan in 2024. What is perhaps most extraordinary about the situation is
  that desperately needed food and medicine lie at the borders of Gaza, leaving
  many to say that this famine is entirely human-made. It’s for this reason,
  among others, that UK prime minister Keir Starmer announced Britain would
  recognise a Palestinian state in September – unless Israel abides by a
  ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution for the Middle East. Israel has
  denied limiting aid shipments. It has accused Hamas of diverting aid and
  blamed food shortages in Gaza on other factors, including distribution
  failures by the UN. To understand the nuance of when famine is declared,
  whether Gaza meets that threshold and what is needed to reverse course, I
  spoke to Francesco Checchi, a professor at the London School of Hygiene &amp;
  Tropical Medicine and one of the county’s leading experts on food insecurity
  in conflict zones. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Asia-Pacific |
  A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake has triggered a series of tsunami warnings
  and evacuation orders across Japan, the US and parts of the Pacific, after the
  shallow quake hit near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula. Israel-Gaza war | A group
  of high-profile Israeli public figures, including academics, artists and
  public intellectuals, has called for “crippling sanctions” to be imposed by
  the international community on Israel, amid mounting horror over its
  starvation of Gaza. Labour | Jeremy Corbyn has accused the Labour government
  of “appeasing” Reform UK by “scapegoating” migrants and minorities for its own
  domestic policy failures, saying his new leftwing political party would take
  on Nigel Farage instead. Economy | Global growth will be stronger than
  previously expected this year after Donald Trump scaled back his most extreme
  tariff threats, the International Monetary Fund said as it upgraded the
  economic outlook for 2025. UK news | Five women who were abused as children by
  Rotherham grooming gangs were also raped by police officers when they were as
  young as 12 years old, they have claimed. In depth: ‘What needs to happen is
  very, very simple: a complete opening of the border’ The IPC was created as a
  tracking tool for hunger by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization in
  2004. It is now the primary means of identifying famine across the world. The
  group applies the same standards across the countries it operates in, using a
  sliding scale from phase one (no or minimal food insecurity) to phase five
  (catastrophe or famine). It defines famine as a situation in which at least
  20% households have an extreme lack of food and face starvation and
  destitution, resulting in extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and
  death. Other classifications for phase five include roughly 30% of children
  under the age of five suffering from acute malnutrition, and two adults or
  four children out of 10,000 people dying from starvation or malnutrition on a
  daily basis. The latest analysis for the IPC makes for grim reading. It notes
  that: • Between May and July 2025, acute malnutrition rates doubled in Khan
  Younis and increased by 70% in Deir al-Balah. • In Gaza City, the acute
  malnutrition soared from 4.4% in May to 16.5% in the first half of July,
  reaching the famine threshold. • Two-fifths of pregnant and breastfeeding
  women in the Gaza Strip were acutely malnourished in June. • In northern Gaza,
  where the humanitarian situation is thought to be the worst, humanitarians are
  operating in the dark due to the lack of data. Famine is often declared in
  clusters within a city or an area, Francesco Checchi told me. “It isn’t
  necessarily the case that an entire population is declared to be in famine
  conditions. But in the case of Gaza, I think that’s what we’re seeing now”.
  *** Is there famine in Gaza? The IPC has stopped short of a formal declaration
  of famine, though its alert noted that some areas have reached the threshold.
  But Checchi, and other leading experts on the topic, are confident there is
  now a famine in Gaza. He explained there are different definitions of famine,
  but the broader one describes it as a situation where people have run out of
  any coping mechanisms to find food for themselves and their children. “By
  coping mechanisms, I mean people sell off their assets, such as furniture,
  anything, borrow money from somebody else, or ask for remittances from
  relatives overseas. Where famine has set in is where none of that is actually
  possible. “So talking to people from charities on the ground that I know, even
  their staff who have money in their pocket quite literally cannot purchase any
  food because there is no food to be purchased in a market,” Checchi said. Some
  on social media have criticised media portrayals of skeletal children in Gaza
  as misleading, including the shocking images and footage of 18-month-old
  Mohammed al-Mutawaq (pictured above with his mother, Hidaya), claiming his
  appearance is the result of other health conditions. “Every time you show a
  single image, you expose yourself to the criticism that any given individual
  child may have some sort of condition that explains what they’re going through
  other than malnutrition,” Checchi said. “Now, I can show you an obvious
  demonstration of the fact that people in Gaza are literally starving: you have
  thousands and thousands of people queueing every day at the Gaza Humanitarian
  Foundation distribution site, even though it is almost certain on any given
  day that they will be fired upon. The fact they are going there anyway, even
  though they may not return, gives you a sense of how absolutely in need of
  food people are.” He added: “When it comes to any individual child, it is
  worth understanding that children do not die of severe malnutrition. Very
  rarely do people literally starve to death. It happens, but it’s relatively
  rare. Instead, people die of conditions that they would have survived from,
  such as common diarrhoea or common respiratory infections, that you and I
  would cope with very easily, but a malnourished body cannot cope with.” It’s
  not surprising then that in a famine the first children to die are those who
  are disabled or have pre-existing conditions, Checchi said. It’s also worth
  noting that in Gaza there are severe shortages of the life-saving medication
  needed to treat these children. “What I think is going to start happening
  inevitably, unless the situation changes radically in the next two to three
  weeks, is that there’s going to be a huge wave of children dying of common
  conditions and who otherwise wouldn’t have,” he warned. *** Do we need more
  data? The IPC alert noted its struggle to get the data necessary to properly
  assess the situation, particularly in northern Gaza. Checchi said that one of
  the main reasons for this is Israel’s tightening of the border crossing,
  preventing humanitarians from working freely through the strip. “The kind of
  analysis that one could have done a year ago is no longer possible. I don’t
  think there is any real information that is missing in terms of declaring a
  famine on the grounds because of the convergence of multiple data and multiple
  contextual information. And I don’t think that governments such as the UK are
  unaware that what is happening is a famine,” Checchi said. *** Why is the UK
  now recognising Palestine? The “increasingly intolerable” situation on the
  ground in Gaza has spearheaded a historic announcement by the UK government:
  it committed to recognising a Palestinian state. UK prime minister Keir
  Starmer told his ministers that recognition would take place ahead of the UN
  general assembly in New York this September, unless Israel agreed to a series
  of conditions set out in the UK-led eight-point peace plan. The UK has called
  on Israel to take “substantive steps” to end the situation in Gaza, reach a
  ceasefire, commit to no annexation in the West Bank, as well as a long-term
  peace process. While many Labour MPs have welcomed the announcement, others
  are unhappy that Palestinian statehood – widely regarded as an inalienable
  right – was being wielded as leverage to pressure Israel into compliance. ***
  What can we do now to stop this catastrophe? For now, severe hunger and death
  continue to stalk the Gaza Strip. Checchi said he was shocked to see the UK
  government back airdrops as a solution to the crisis of hunger in Gaza. The
  studies on the effectiveness of airdrops and former US president Joe Biden’s
  humanitarian aid pier were damning: it only contributed about 1% of caloric
  need in Gaza last year. “Airdrops are actually dangerous because they kill
  people. People will drown trying to reach food [while others have been crushed
  to death by them]. They are ineffective and inefficient,” Checchi said. “What
  needs to happen is very, very simple: a complete opening of the border
  crossings, and a complete restart of the traditional system of food
  distribution run by Unrwa, which has been running for decades now. They know
  what to do. They have the lists of people, they have the warehouses, they have
  everything in place to restart that system.” Checchi was keen to emphasise
  that the worst can still be averted. “If food began to flood in and people
  were able to access it, despite reaching famine levels, the situation could
  conceivably reverse quite quickly. Whereas if you leave that for another two
  weeks or three weeks, then I think it’s almost inevitable we’ll see extremely
  high levels of child mortality.” The issue, as always, is political will. What
  else we’ve been reading Here’s a lovely piece about grandparents who get roped
  into school runs, sleepovers, film nights and baking (like Rita
  Labiche-Robinson, pictured above with her granddaughter Nia). For many, the
  main reason is simple: they enjoy it. Their kids seem to appreciate it, too.
  Phoebe Keir Starmer was sold to the public as a distinguished human rights
  lawyer who would restore the UK’s commitment to international law if he won
  the election. But, since he became prime minister, many are asking why he is
  so cautious about tackling human rights abuses. Aamna It’ll be American
  families who pick up the bill for Trump’s tariffs, writes Callum Jones.
  Estimates suggest the impact so far is the equivalent to an average income
  loss of $2,400 (£1,800) per US household. Phoebe England are European
  champions – again. The togetherness of the team, including their shared anger
  at the racist abuse meted out to black players, was central in helping them
  clinch victory. Aamna Campaigners in Devon have mapped out land ownership
  along the Dart river and found it has 108 separate owners. Ownership is often
  murky –one-eighth of it is owned via offshore companies. Looks like the

  England could be a logistical nightmare. Phoebe Sport Football | A total of
  65,000 jubilant England fans lined the Mall in central London on Tuesday to
  welcome home the victorious Lionesses after their Euro 2025 victory on Sunday.
  The England squad, who returned from Switzerland on Monday after their victory

  Surrey’s head groundsman on Tuesday. Cycling | Dutch rider Lorena Wiebes
  stormed to her second consecutive stage victory at the Tour de France Femmes,
  winning the fourth leg with a dominant sprint finish. The largely flat 130km
  stage from Saumur to Poitiers saw the peloton remain tightly packed until the
  closing stretch before a showdown among the sprinters. The front pages The
  Guardian leads with “UK to recognise state of Palestine unless Israel commits
  to ceasefire”. The Mirror calls it an “Ultimatum”, while the Times says
  “Israel blasts Starmer over recognition of Palestine”. The Telegraph quotes
  Benjamin Netanyahu, saying “Starmer ‘rewarding Hamas on Palestine’”, while the
  Mail follows the same line with “Starmer’s ‘reward for Hamas’”. The Financial
  Times reports “Reeves’ impatience for full Revolut approval triggers clash
  with Bailey”. Finally, the Sun reports on the end of a celebrity marriage with
  “Cat &amp; Pat split”. Today in Focus Can people still protest about Palestine
  in the UK? What has been the impact of Palestine Action’s proscription as a
  terrorist organisation? Haroon Siddique reports. Cartoon of the day | Ella
  Baron The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad
  A Cambridge-based antiques dealer snapped up a Salvador Dalí painting at a
  house clearance sale after spotting Dalí’s signature scrawled on the
  bottom-right corner. The painting of a bejewelled sultan hadn’t garnered much
  interest among others at the auction. “I wasn’t sure I’d have it on the wall,
  to be honest,” said John Russell (not his real name). But he realised he was
  on to a winner, and was confident in his ability to spot an imitation thanks
  to years spent avidly watching the BBC TV show Fake or Fortune?. The painting
  only attracted two bidders, and Russell quickly outbid the other person when
  he offered £150. The Dalí expert Nicolas Descharnes confirmed to the Guardian
  it was authentic, albeit not his usual style. “People expect to see very
  surrealist pieces by Dalí. This one is not surrealist, but it’s a Dalí,” he
  said. It is now valued at £20,000 to £30,000. Sign up here for a weekly
