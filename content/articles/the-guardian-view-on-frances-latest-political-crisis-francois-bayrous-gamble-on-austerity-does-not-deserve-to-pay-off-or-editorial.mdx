  gamble on austerity does not deserve to pay off | Editorial

  Following a startling victory for Marine Le Pen in European elections last
  June, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, foolishly called a snap
  legislative poll. The idea was to give voters a salutary wake-up call, daring
  them to repeat their embrace of Ms Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in
  a domestic election. The unanticipated result was a suddenly deadlocked
  parliament, in which the influence of the National Rally and the left
  significantly increased, and a lame-duck status for Mr Macron’s second term.
  That failed gamble has now led to another, which appears equally doomed. This
  week, Mr Macron’s fourth prime minister in two years put the future of his
  minority government on the line, in an attempt to pass a deeply unpopular
  budget this autumn. François Bayrou, intending to deliver his own wake-up call
  to MPs, has unexpectedly called a confidence vote to take place early next
  month. MPs will be challenged to either endorse in principle Mr Bayrou’s view
  that austerity is necessary to reduce the public deficit, or vote for the
  government to fall. Mr Bayrou may have thought that he might as well beat MPs
  to it. Last December, his immediate predecessor, Michel Barnier, was
  ignominiously forced out after failing to push through his own spending cuts.
  But the chances of the prime minister’s bet coming off appear slim in the
  extreme: the combined forces of the French left and Ms Le Pen’s far-right MPs
  are set to vote against Mr Bayrou, which would be more than enough to seal his
  fate. The prospect of a second centre-right government collapsing over failed
  austerity has already triggered market unease, with rising interest payments
  on public debt reflecting France’s lack of monetary sovereignty. The country’s
  borrowing costs are ultimately shaped by European Central Bank policy despite
  a deficit nearly twice the eurozone average. On Tuesday, Mr Bayrou’s finance
  minister attempted to spook MPs by suggesting that if government borrowing was
  not reined in, France may even find itself going cap in hand to the
  International Monetary Fund. But it is the government that needs to embark on
  a political rethink rather than the public or opposition MPs. While
  rhetorically calling for collective sacrifice to restore the nation to fiscal
  good health, Mr Bayrou has focused overwhelmingly on the less well-off,
  pensioners and welfare recipients, as he seeks in the region of €44bn worth of
  savings. In a country where Mr Macron’s first-term abolition of a wealth tax
  has contributed to rising inequality and a boom in the assets of the
  super-rich, that has not gone down well. As one leftwing MP suggested this
  week, the prime minister’s chances of political survival would be far higher
  if he chose to put an end to the “fiscal gifts to the rich and to large
  companies, which Macron has increased like never before”. The chances of that
  happening are, of course, zero (although Mr Bayrou has vaguely hinted at the
  possibility of asking for a “specific effort” from the very wealthy). It thus
  appears likely that Mr Macron’s first autumn task will be to find yet another
  prime minister or call fresh elections with Ms Le Pen’s party far ahead in the
  polls. With a wave of planned strikes and demonstrations due to begin two days
  after Mr Bayrou’s fate is decided, Mr Macron’s presidency is petering out amid
  domestic acrimony and political stasis. He has only himself to blame.
