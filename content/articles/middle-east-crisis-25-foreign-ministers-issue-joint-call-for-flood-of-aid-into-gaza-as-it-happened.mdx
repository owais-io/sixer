  The foreign ministers of 25 countries including the UK, Australia, France,
  Spain and Japan as well as two signatories from the EU have released a joint
  statement saying that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable
  levels” and calling for the government of Israel to let in aid shipments and
  allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza. Israeli opposition
  leader Yair Lapid has backed calls for a general strike in solidarity with
  hostages still held in Gaza, AFP reports. “Strike on Sunday,” Lapid posted on
  X, saying even supporters of the current government should take part and
  insisting it was not party political. Iranian police arrested as many as
  21,000 “suspects” during the country’s 12-day war with Israel in June, Reuters
  reports, citing state media. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air
  strikes on Gaza City have intensified in recent days, following prime minister
  Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet approving plans to expand the war there,
  AFP reports. The World Health Organization said Israel should let it stock
  medical supplies to deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza,
  before it seizes control of Gaza City, AFP reports. Israel’s defence minister
  has reprimanded the country’s military chief over appointments made without
  his approval, as tensions simmered between the military and the executive
  ahead of a planned expansion of the war in Gaza. The Council of Europe urged
  its member states on Tuesday to halt deliveries of weapons to Israel if they
  could be used for human rights violations. Michael O’Flaherty, the Council’s
  commissioner for human rights, said member states should do “their utmost to
  prevent and address violations of international human rights” in the conflict.
  Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office has said Israel is blocking the entry
  of more than 430 food items into the territory, despite allowing some aid
  trucks through last month under international pressure. The Elders group of
  international stateswomen and statesmen for the first time on Tuesday called
  the situation in Gaza an “unfolding genocide”, saying that Israel’s
  obstruction of aid was causing a “famine”. At least 89 Palestinians, 31
  seeking aid, have been killed and 513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza
  in the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health ministry. France
  added to the voices condemning Israel’s strikes on journalists in Gaza and
  called on the Israeli authorities to guarantee “safe and unhindered access”
  for international media, AFP reports. Denmark will send a Hercules military
  plane to airdrop aid to Gaza, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen
  told reporters on Tuesday. Norway’s $2tn sovereign wealth fund, the world’s
  largest, has said it expects to divest from more Israeli companies as part of
  its ongoing review of investments in the country over the situation in Gaza
  and the West Bank, Reuters reports A Hamas delegation is holding talks with
  Egyptian officials in Cairo to repair their relationship after it deteriorated
  last week, Egyptian and Palestinian sources told Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
  Australia prime minister Anthony Albanese said his Israeli counterpart
  Benjamin Netanyahu was “in denial” about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a
  day after announcing Australia would recognise a Palestinian state for the
  first time, Reuters reports. Israel has stepped up bombing Gaza, killing at
  least 89 Palestinians in 24 hours, including at least 15 people queueing for
  food, despite global outcry over the deaths of six journalists in the
  territory the previous day. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air
  strikes on Gaza City had intensified in the three days after Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s security cabinet approved plans to expand the war in the
  territory. Five more people, including two children, were reported to have
  died of starvation, as the foreign ministers of 24 countries including the UK,
  Australia, France, Spain and Japan warned that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza
  has reached unimaginable levels”. The ministers and the EU foreign policy
  chief, Kaja Kallas, called on the government of Israel to let in aid shipments
  immediately and allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza.
  “Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation,” they said. More
  than 15 people were killed while waiting for food distribution at the Zikim
  crossing in northern Gaza, said Fares Awad, head of the ambulance services in
  northern Gaza. In the south of the territory, five people including a couple
  and their child, were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of
  Khan Younis and four by a strike on a tent encampment in nearby Mawasi, medics
  said. Iran could hold direct nuclear talks with the United States if
  conditions are suitable, first vice-president Mohammadreza Aref said on
  Tuesday, according to state media. But he said US demands for Tehran to drop
  uranium enrichment entirely were “a joke”. A sixth round of talks between
  Tehran and Washington was suspended following Israeli and US strikes on
  Iranian nuclear facilities in June. Both powers accuse Iran of seeking nuclear
  weapons, an accusation Tehran has rejected. A Palestinian man carries food
  items collected from aid packages dropped from an aeroplane, amid the hunger
  crisis, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, earlier today. Denmark
  will send a Hercules military plane to airdrop aid to Gaza, Danish foreign
  minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told reporters on Tuesday. Palestinian children
  carry jerrycans after collecting water from a distribution point in Gaza City
  today. France added to the voices condemning Israel’s strikes on journalists
  in Gaza and called on the Israeli authorities to guarantee “safe and
  unhindered access” for international media, AFP reports. On Sunday, five Al
  Jazeera journalists were killed in an Israeli strike on their tent in Gaza
  City. A freelance reporter was also killed in the strike. Condemning the
  strike, the French foreign ministry said that the journalists were targeted
  while “carrying out their reporting duties”. “Journalists must never be
  targeted,” Pascal Confavreux, a spokesman for the French foreign ministry,
  said in a statement, adding that they were protected by international
  humanitarian law. International journalists “must be able to operate freely
  and independently to document the reality of the conflict,” he added. The
  foreign ministers of 25 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain
  and Japan as well as two signatories from the EU have released a joint
  statement saying that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable
  levels” and calling for the government of Israel to let in aid shipments and
  allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza. The statement in full:
  The humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels. Famine is
  unfolding before our eyes. Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse
  starvation. Humanitarian space must be protected, and aid should never be
  politicised. However, due to restrictive new registration requirements,
  essential international NGOs may be forced to leave the OPTs imminently which
  would worsen the humanitarian situation still further. We call on the
  government of Israel to provide authorisation for all international NGO aid
  shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating.
  Immediate, permanent and concrete steps must be taken to facilitate safe,
  large-scale access for the UN, international NGOs and humanitarian partners.
  All crossings and routes must be used to allow a flood of aid into Gaza,
  including food, nutrition supplies, shelter, fuel, clean water, medicine and
  medical equipment. Lethal force must not be used at distribution sites, and
  civilians, humanitarians and medical workers must be protected. We are
  grateful to the US, Qatar and Egypt for their efforts in pushing for a
  ceasefire and pursuing peace. We need a ceasefire that can end the war, for
  hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered. The
  signatories: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
  France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the
  Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
  and the UK. The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
  and Vice-President of the European Commission, the EU Commissioner for the
  Mediterranean and the EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis
  Management. Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office has said Israel is
  blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into the territory, despite
  allowing some aid trucks through last month under international pressure. The
  office said banned items include “frozen meat of all kinds, frozen fish,
  cheese, dairy products, frozen vegetables, and fruits”, along with “hundreds
  of other items needed by the starving and sick”. The statement said the
  partial easing announced on July 27 has not lifted broad restrictions on food
  and other essential goods. The statement added that Israel had directly
  targeted food sources, by not just preventing aid, but deliberately bombing 44
  food banks, killing dozens of workers in them, and targeting “57 food
  distribution centers with bombardment”. The Guardian could not independtly
  verify these claims. Earlier today Cogat, the Israeli MoD organisation tasked
  with facilitating logistics in Gaza said: “300 trucks carrying humanitarian
  goods entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings, and over 270
  trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international
  organisations. Additionally, tankers of UN fuel entered for the operation of
  essential humanitarian systems.” Iranian police arrested as many as 21,000
  “suspects” during the country’s 12-day war with Israel in June, Reuters
  reports, citing state media. Following Israeli air strikes that began on 13
  June, Iranian security forces began a campaign of widespread arrests
  accompanied by an intensified street presence based around checkpoints and
  “public reports” whereby citizens were called upon to report on any
  individuals they thought were acting suspiciously. “There was a 41% increase
  in calls by the public, which led to the arrest of 21,000 suspects during the
  12-day war,” police spokesperson Saeid Montazerolmahdi said. He did not say
  what those arrested were suspected of, but Tehran has spoken before of people
  passing on information that may have helped direct the Israeli attacks. The
  Israel-Iran conflict has also led to an accelerated rate of deportations for
  Afghan migrants believed to be illegally in Iran, with aid agencies reporting
  that local authorities had also accused some Afghan nationals of spying for
  Israel. “Law enforcement rounded up 2,774 illegal migrants and discovered 30
  special security cases by examining their phones. 261 suspects of espionage
  and 172 people accused of unauthorised filming were also arrested,” the
  spokesperson added. Montazerolmahdi did not specify how many of those arrested
  had since been released. Israel’s defence minister has reprimanded the
  country’s military chief over appointments made without his approval, as
  tensions simmered between the military and the executive ahead of a planned
  expansion of the war in Gaza. Agence France-Presse reports that Israel Katz’s
  defence ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that deliberations conducted
  by chief of staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir on military appointments “took
  place... without prior coordination or agreement” with the minister. The
  statement added that this was “in violation of accepted procedure” and that
  Katz therefore “does not intend to discuss or approve any of the appointments
  or names that were published.” In an army statement published shortly
  afterwards, Zamir responded that he was “the sole authority authorised to
  appoint officers from the rank of colonel upwards”. “The chief of staff makes
  the appointment decisions - after which the appointment is brought to the
  minister for approval,” the statement added. Tensions have been simmering for
  two weeks between the chief of staff and Benjamin Netanyahu’s government over
  the next steps in the military operation in Gaza, aimed at freeing the
  remaining hostages and defeating Hamas. Israeli media reported that Zamir was
  opposed to a plan approved by the security cabinet on Friday to take control
  of all of Gaza City, instead favouring encircling it. The Council of Europe
  urged its member states on Tuesday to halt deliveries of weapons to Israel if
  they could be used for human rights violations. Michael O’Flaherty, the
  Council’s commissioner for human rights, said member states should do “their
  utmost to prevent and address violations of international human rights” in the
  conflict. “This includes applying existing legal standards to ensure that arms
  transfers are not authorised where there is a risk that they may be used to
  commit human rights violations,” he said, in a statement. It was also
  “essential to intensify efforts to provide relief to those affected by the
  conflict, by supporting efforts to ensure unhindered access for humanitarian
  assistance and by pressing for the immediate release of hostages,” O’Flaherty
  said. The call by the Council – a human rights organisation representing 46
  states – comes shortly after Germany said it would halt delivery to Israel of
  some weapons that could be used in Gaza as part of Israeli plans to take
  control of Gaza City. O’Flaherty said the Council had taken note of this and
  other government initiatives, and also of contributions by some national human
  rights structures in raising awareness. “However, more needs to be done, and
  quickly,” he said. The Elders group of international stateswomen and statesmen
  for the first time on Tuesday called the situation in Gaza an “unfolding
  genocide”, saying that Israel’s obstruction of aid was causing a “famine”.
  “Today we express our shock and outrage at Israel’s deliberate obstruction of
  the entry of life-saving humanitarian aid into Gaza,” the non-governmental
  group of public figures, founded by former South Africa president Nelson
  Mandela in 2007, said in a statement after delegates visited border crossings
  in Egypt. “What we saw and heard underlines our personal conviction that there
  is not only an unfolding, human-caused famine in Gaza. There is an unfolding
  genocide.” Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand, called on Israel
  to open the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza so aid could be
  delivered, after visiting the site. “Many new mothers are unable to feed
  themselves or their newborn babies adequately, and the health system is
  collapsing,” she said. “All of this threatens the very survival of an entire
  generation.” Clark was joined by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland
  and former UN high commissioner for human rights, on the visit. She said that
  international leaders “have the power and the legal obligation to apply
  measures to pressure this Israeli government to end its atrocity crimes”. The
  World Health Organization said Israel should let it stock medical supplies to
  deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza, before it seizes control
  of Gaza City, AFP reports. Israel has said its military would “take control”
  of Gaza City in a plan approved by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  security cabinet that sparked a wave of global criticism. “We want to stock
  up, and we all hear about more humanitarian supplies are allowed in – well
  it’s not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik
  Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in the Palestinian territories. 52% of
  medicines were running at zero stock, Peeperkorn said, speaking from
  Jerusalem. Peeperkorn said the WHO was able to bring in fewer supplies than it
  wanted “due to the cumbersome procedures” and products “still denied” entry –
  a topic of constant negotiation with the Israeli authorities. “We want to as
  quickly stock up hospitals … following the news – the whole discussion about
  an incursion in Gaza,” he said. “We currently cannot do that … We need to be
  able to get all essential medicines and medical supplies in.” Peeperkorn said
  only 50% of hospitals and 38% of primary health care centres were functioning,
  and even then partially. Bed occupancy has reached 240% capacity in the
  Al-Shifa hospital and 300% at Al-Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza. “The overall
  health situation remains catastrophic,” he said. “Hunger and malnutrition
  continue to ravage Gaza”. At least 89 Palestinians, 31 seeking aid, have been
  killed and 513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours,
  according to the territory’s health ministry. Eleven bodies were also
  recovered from the rubble of previous Israeli attacks, the ministry statement
  said on the Telegram messaging app. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed a total of
  61,599 Palestinians and injured 154,088 since October 7, 2023, the ministry
  added. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has backed calls for a general
  strike in solidarity with hostages still held in Gaza, AFP reports. “Strike on
  Sunday,” Lapid posted on X, saying even supporters of the current government
  should take part and insisting it was not party political. “Strike out of
  solidarity. Strike because the families have asked, and that’s reason enough.
  Strike because no one has a monopoly on emotion, on mutual responsibility, on
  Jewish values.” Sunday is the first day of the working week in Israel. Lapid’s
  post followed a call on Sunday by around 20 parents of hostages still held by
  Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip for a strike. On Monday, the Hostages
  and Missing Families Forum, the main representative group for relatives,
  backed the idea. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes on Gaza
  City have intensified in recent days, following prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s security cabinet approving plans to expand the war there, AFP
  reports. The Israeli government has not provided an exact timetable on when
  its forces would enter the area, but according to the civil defence agency
  spokesman Mahmud Bassal, air strikes on Gaza City have been increasing for the
  past three days. Bassal said the residential neighbourhoods of Zeitoun and
  Sabra have been hit “with very heavy airstrikes targeting civilian homes,
  possibly including high-rise buildings”. “For the third consecutive day, the
  Israeli occupation is intensifying its bombardment,” said the spokesman. “The
  Israeli occupation is using all types of weapons in that area - bombs, drones,
  and also highly explosive munitions that cause massive destruction to civilian
  homes,” he added. Bassal said that at least 24 people had been killed across
  Gaza on Tuesday, including several casualties caused by strikes on Gaza City.
  “The bombardment has been extremely intense for the past two days. With every
  strike, the ground shakes. There are martyrs under the rubble that no one can
  reach because the shelling hasn’t stopped,” said Majed al-Hosary, a resident
  in Zeitoun. AFP provides some analysis on what Israel’s military can expect to
  face in its new offensive on Gaza City: In a dense urban landscape, with
  likely thousands of Hamas fighters lying in wait, taking Gaza City will be a
  difficult and costly slog for the Israeli army, security experts say. On
  Sunday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out his vision of
  victory in Gaza following 22 months of war – with the military ordered to
  attack the last remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza City and the central camps
  further south. Amir Avivi, a former Israeli general and head of the Israeli
  Defense and Security Forum think tank, described the city as the “heart of
  Hamas’s rule in Gaza”. “Gaza City has always been the centre of government and
  also has the strongest brigade of Hamas,” he said. According to Michael
  Milshtein, who heads the Palestinian Studies Program at Tel Aviv University,
  Hamas’s military wing could have as many as 10,000 to 15,000 fighters in Gaza
  City, many of them freshly recruited. “It’s very easy to convince a 17, 18,
  19-year-old Palestinian to be a part of Al-Qassam Brigades,” Milshtein told
  AFP. Other obstacles could include improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and the
  use of civilians as human shields in a dense urban maze of narrow alleys and
  tall buildings, according to press reports. “It’s almost impossible to go in
  there without creating both hostage casualties and a large humanitarian
  disaster,” said Mairav Zonszein of the International Crisis Group. “They will
  simply destroy everything, and then nothing will be left,” she said. Israeli
  planes and tanks kept bombarding eastern areas of Gaza City overnight, killing
  at least 11 people, witnesses and medics said, Reuters reports. Witnesses and
  medics said the Israeli military pounded eastern districts of Gaza City again
  overnight, killing seven people in two houses in the Zeitoun suburb and four
  in an apartment building in the city centre. In the south of the territory,
  five people including a couple and their child were killed by an Israeli
  airstrike on a house in the city of Khan Younis and four by a strike on a tent
  encampment in nearby Mawasi, medics said. The Israeli military said it was
  looking into the reports and that its forces take precautions to mitigate
  civilian harm. Separately, it said that its forces had killed dozens of
  militants in north Gaza over the past month and destroyed more tunnels used by
  militants in the area. In a post on X, Israel Defense Forces claim to have
  “debunked” what it called Hamas’s “starvation campaign” in Gaza. The IDF said
  that reviews of documents showed that most deaths by malnutrition in Gaza were
  linked to “severe pre-existing conditions” and that only a handful of the 133
  deaths by malnutrition claimed by Gaza’s authorities in July could be
  “verified”. The post said that the “expert review concluded that there are no
  signs of a widespread malnutrition phenomenon among the population in Gaza”.
  While these claims could not be independently verified, the Guardian’s
  reporting has covered the growing starvation crisis in Gaza. The UN has said
  Gaza is facing “starvation, pure and simple”. The head of the World Health
  Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a “large proportion” of Gaza’s
  population was starving. As reported earlier this morning, Gaza’s health
  ministry recorded “five deaths due to famine and malnutrition over the past 24
  hours, including two children”, bringing the total number of hunger-related
  deaths recorded since 7 October, 2023 to 227, including 103 children. Writing
  after Israel killed six journalists in Gaza on Sunday night, including five Al
  Jazeera staff members, Hind Khoudary, an Al Jazeera journalist working in Gaza
  said: “Even though Anas (al-Sharif) has been assassinated, even though
  Mohammed (Qreiqeh) has been killed, there are many more Palestinian
  journalists willing to follow in their footsteps, and report on what is
  happening in those areas. This has been very hard on every single Palestinian
  journalist. Their funeral yesterday was very sad; people in the streets were
  crying and calling out, “Where did you go and leave us, Anas?” Palestinians
  feel they have lost a part of themselves and a member of their family. This
  has been very hard on us, but we are going to continue reporting. Gaza City
  will not be silenced.” Norway’s $2tn sovereign wealth fund, the world’s
  largest, has said it expects to divest from more Israeli companies as part of
  its ongoing review of investments in the country over the situation in Gaza
  and the West Bank, Reuters reports The fund announced on Monday it was
  terminating contracts with external asset managers handling some of its
  Israeli investments and has divested parts of its portfolio in the country.
  The review began last week following media reports that the fund had built a
  stake of just over 2% in an Israeli jet engine group that provides services to
  Israel’s armed forces, including the maintenance of fighter jets. The stake in
  the company, Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd (BSEL), has now been sold, the fund
  announced. Bet Shemesh did not respond to requests for comment. Norges Bank
  Investment Management (NBIM), an arm of Norway’s central bank, which held
  stakes in 61 Israeli companies as of 30 June, in recent days divested stakes
  in 11 firms, including BSEL. It did not name the other companies. “We expect
  to divest from more companies,” NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen told a press
  conference on Tuesday. Gaza’s health ministry has recorded “five deaths due to
  famine and malnutrition over the past 24 hours, including two children”. This
  brings the total number of hunger-related deaths recorded since 7 October,
  2023 to 227, including 103 children. The UN has warned Gaza is "experiencing
  “starvation, pure and simple” as Israel gears up for a renewed offensive in
  the territory. A Hamas delegation is holding talks with Egyptian officials in
  Cairo to repair their relationship after it deteriorated last week, Egyptian
  and Palestinian sources told Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Khalil al-Hayya, a
  high-ranking Hamas figure in Qatar, had hinted Egyptians should rise up in
  protest of the starvation in Gaza, leading to tensions between Hamas and
  Egypt. “Netanyahu is setting conditions for surrender and is not hinting at
  any change in his position, so the round of talks is starting with little
  hope,” a source told the newspaper. Meanwhile, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are
  working on a nnew ceasefire and hostage-release plan to be presented to Hamas,
  according to a report by Sky News Arabia. The UN agency for Palestine, Unrwa,
  has warned that Gaza’s children face becoming a “lost generation” as conflict
  has robbed them of education. “The longer children in Gaza are out of school,
  the greater the risk of a lost generation. Every day away from the classroom
  takes away the future they deserve. The consequences of this war are long term
  for Gaza’s children. A ceasefire is the first step to getting them back to
  school,” the agency said in a post on X. The United Nations office for the
  coordination of humanitarian affairs said that according to the latest
  satellite-based damage assessment in July, 97% of educational facilities in
  Gaza have sustained some level of damage with 91% requiring major
  rehabilitation or complete reconstruction to become functional again.
  Australia prime minister Anthony Albanese said his Israeli counterpart
  Benjamin Netanyahu was “in denial” about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a
  day after announcing Australia would recognise a Palestinian state for the
  first time, Reuters reports. Australia will recognise a Palestinian state at
  next month’s United Nations General Assembly, Albanese said on Monday, a move
  that adds to international pressure on Israel after similar announcements from
  France, the UK and Canada. Albanese said the Netanyahu government’s reluctance
  to listen to its allies contributed to Australia‘s decision to recognise a
  Palestinian state. “He again reiterated to me what he has said publicly as
  well, which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for
  innocent people,” Albanese said in an interview with state broadcaster ABC,
  recounting a Thursday phone call with Netanyahu discussing the issue.
  Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state is conditional on
  commitments received from the Palestinian Authority, including that Islamist
  militant group Hamas would have no involvement in any future state.
  Right-leaning opposition leader Sussan Ley said the move, which breaks with
  long-held bipartisan policy over Israel and the Palestinian territories,
  risked jeopardising Australia’s relationship with the US. People gathered in
  cities around the world to protest the Israeli killing of six journalists in
  Gaza. Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said now is not the time
  to recognise a Palestinian state. Blinken, who served under president Joe
  Biden from 2021 to 2025, argued in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that
  the focus should be on the release of Israeli hostages, bringing humanitarian
  aid into Gaza and the withdrawal of the IDF from the Palestinian territory.
  Blinken said the decision by France, the UK and other countries to recognise a
  Palestinian state is “morally right and reflects a global consensus,” but
  added that doing so without requiring the removal of Hamas from power “would
  fortify proponents of terror on the Palestinian side and rejectionists of
  Palestinian statehood on the Israeli side.” Israel has stepped up bombing in
  Gaza despite global outcry over the killing of six journalists in the
  territory on Sunday night. Israeli forces killed at least 55 people across the
  Gaza Strip over Sunday night and into Monday, including a well-known
  journalist Israel said was a Hamas militant, as well as people seeking
  humanitarian aid, according to local health officials. Hospital officials
  reported at least 34 people were killed on Monday, not including the six
  journalists who were slain in a tent shortly before midnight. More than 15
  people were killed while waiting for aid at the Zikim crossing in northern
  Gaza, said Fares Awad, head of the ambulance services in northern Gaza.
  Israel’s military did not immediately respond to questions about the deaths.
  Earlier on Monday, it said air and artillery units were operating in northern
  Gaza and in Khan Younis, where resident Noha Abu Shamala told AP that two
  drone strikes killed a family of seven in their apartment. Other key events
  include: Palestinians reported the heaviest bombardments in weeks on Monday in
  areas east of Gaza City, just hours after Israeli prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu said he expected to complete a new expanded offensive in the
  territory “fairly quickly”. The EU condemned the killing of five Al Jazeera
  journalists in an Israeli airstrike outside Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City,
  including Al Jazeera correspondent Anas Al Sharif. “We take note of the
  Israeli allegation that the group was Hamas terrorists, but there is a need in
  these cases to provide clear evidence, in the respect of rule of law, to avoid
  targeting of journalists,” foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in a
  statement on X. The EU joins the UN, Reporters Without Borders, the Foreign
  Press Association and a host of other organisations in denouncing the attack.
  Palestinians in Gaza gathered on Monday for the funeral of the five Al Jazeera
  staff members and a sixth reporter killed in an Israeli strike. Dozens stood
  amid bombed-out buildings in the courtyard of Al-Shifa hospital to pay their
  respects to Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera correspondent aged 28, and
  four of his colleagues, killed on Sunday. Video footage appears to show the
  moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward
  him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank
  last month. The video released Sunday by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights
  group, shows Israeli settler Yinon Levi firing a gun toward the person
  filming. The footage cuts but the camera keeps rolling as the person moans in
  pain.

The foreign ministers of 25 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain and Japan as well as two signatories from the EU have released a joint statement saying that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels” and calling for the government of Israel to let in aid shipments and allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has backed calls for a general strike in solidarity with hostages still held in Gaza, AFP reports. “Strike on Sunday,” Lapid posted on X, saying even supporters of the current government should take part and insisting it was not party political. Iranian police arrested as many as 21,000 “suspects” during the country’s 12-day war with Israel in June, Reuters reports, citing state media.

Israel’s defence minister has reprimanded the country’s military chief over appointments made without his approval, as tensions simmered between the military and the executive ahead of a planned expansion of the war in Gaza. The Council of Europe urged its member states on Tuesday to halt deliveries of weapons to Israel if they could be used for human rights violations. Michael O’Flaherty, the Council’s commissioner for human rights, said member states should do “their utmost to prevent and address violations of international human rights” in the conflict. Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office has said Israel is blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into the territory, despite allowing some aid trucks through last month under international pressure. The Elders group of international stateswomen and statesmen for the first time on Tuesday called the situation in Gaza an “unfolding genocide”, saying that Israel’s obstruction of aid was causing a “famine”. At least 89 Palestinians, 31 seeking aid, have been killed and 513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health ministry. France added to the voices condemning Israel’s strikes on journalists in Gaza and called on the Israeli authorities to guarantee “safe and unhindered access” for international media, AFP reports. Denmark will send a Hercules military plane to airdrop aid to Gaza, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told reporters on Tuesday. Norway’s $2tn sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has said it expects to divest from more Israeli companies as part of its ongoing review of investments in the country over the situation in Gaza and the West Bank, Reuters reports A Hamas delegation is holding talks with Egyptian officials in Cairo to repair their relationship after it deteriorated last week, Egyptian and Palestinian sources told Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Australia prime minister Anthony Albanese said his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu was “in denial” about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a day after announcing Australia would recognise a Palestinian state for the first time, Reuters reports. Israel has stepped up bombing Gaza, killing at least 89 Palestinians in 24 hours, including at least 15 people queueing for food, despite global outcry over the deaths of six journalists in the territory the previous day. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes on Gaza City had intensified in the three days after Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet approved plans to expand the war in the territory. Five more people, including two children, were reported to have died of starvation, as the foreign ministers of 24 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain and Japan warned that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels”. The ministers and the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called on the government of Israel to let in aid shipments immediately and allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza. “Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation,” they said. More than 15 people were killed while waiting for food distribution at the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza, said Fares Awad, head of the ambulance services in northern Gaza. In the south of the territory, five people including a couple and their child, were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of Khan Younis and four by a strike on a tent encampment in nearby Mawasi, medics said. Iran could hold direct nuclear talks with the United States if conditions are suitable, first vice-president Mohammadreza Aref said on Tuesday, according to state media. But he said US demands for Tehran to drop uranium enrichment entirely were “a joke”. A sixth round of talks between Tehran and Washington was suspended following Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June. Both powers accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, an accusation Tehran has rejected. A Palestinian man carries food items collected from aid packages dropped from an aeroplane, amid the hunger crisis, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, earlier today. Denmark will send a Hercules military plane to airdrop aid to Gaza, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told reporters on Tuesday. Palestinian children carry jerrycans after collecting water from a distribution point in Gaza City today. France added to the voices condemning Israel’s strikes on journalists in Gaza and called on the Israeli authorities to guarantee “safe and unhindered access” for international media, AFP reports. On Sunday, five Al Jazeera journalists were killed in an Israeli strike on their tent in Gaza City. A freelance reporter was also killed in the strike. Condemning the strike, the French foreign ministry said that the journalists were targeted while “carrying out their reporting duties”. “Journalists must never be targeted,” Pascal Confavreux, a spokesman for the French foreign ministry, said in a statement, adding that they were protected by international humanitarian law. International journalists “must be able to operate freely and independently to document the reality of the conflict,” he added. The foreign ministers of 25 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain and Japan as well as two signatories from the EU have released a joint statement saying that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels” and calling for the government of Israel to let in aid shipments and allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza. The statement in full: The humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels. Famine is unfolding before our eyes. Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation. Humanitarian space must be protected, and aid should never be politicised. However, due to restrictive new registration requirements, essential international NGOs may be forced to leave the OPTs imminently which would worsen the humanitarian situation still further. We call on the government of Israel to provide authorisation for all international NGO aid shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating. Immediate, permanent and concrete steps must be taken to facilitate safe, large-scale access for the UN, international NGOs and humanitarian partners. All crossings and routes must be used to allow a flood of aid into Gaza, including food, nutrition supplies, shelter, fuel, clean water, medicine and medical equipment. Lethal force must not be used at distribution sites, and civilians, humanitarians and medical workers must be protected. We are grateful to the US, Qatar and Egypt for their efforts in pushing for a ceasefire and pursuing peace. We need a ceasefire that can end the war, for hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered. The signatories: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, the EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean and the EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management. Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office has said Israel is blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into the territory, despite allowing some aid trucks through last month under international pressure. The office said banned items include “frozen meat of all kinds, frozen fish, cheese, dairy products, frozen vegetables, and fruits”, along with “hundreds of other items needed by the starving and sick”. The statement said the partial easing announced on July 27 has not lifted broad restrictions on food and other essential goods. The statement added that Israel had directly targeted food sources, by not just preventing aid, but deliberately bombing 44 food banks, killing dozens of workers in them, and targeting “57 food distribution centers with bombardment”. The Guardian could not independtly verify these claims. Earlier today Cogat, the Israeli MoD organisation tasked with facilitating logistics in Gaza said: “300 trucks carrying humanitarian goods entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings, and over 270 trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international organisations. Additionally, tankers of UN fuel entered for the operation of essential humanitarian systems.” Iranian police arrested as many as 21,000 “suspects” during the country’s 12-day war with Israel in June, Reuters reports, citing state media. Following Israeli air strikes that began on 13 June, Iranian security forces began a campaign of widespread arrests accompanied by an intensified street presence based around checkpoints and “public reports” whereby citizens were called upon to report on any individuals they thought were acting suspiciously. “There was a 41% increase in calls by the public, which led to the arrest of 21,000 suspects during the 12-day war,” police spokesperson Saeid Montazerolmahdi said. He did not say what those arrested were suspected of, but Tehran has spoken before of people passing on information that may have helped direct the Israeli attacks. The Israel-Iran conflict has also led to an accelerated rate of deportations for Afghan migrants believed to be illegally in Iran, with aid agencies reporting that local authorities had also accused some Afghan nationals of spying for Israel. “Law enforcement rounded up 2,774 illegal migrants and discovered 30 special security cases by examining their phones. 261 suspects of espionage and 172 people accused of unauthorised filming were also arrested,” the spokesperson added. Montazerolmahdi did not specify how many of those arrested had since been released. Israel’s defence minister has reprimanded the country’s military chief over appointments made without his approval, as tensions simmered between the military and the executive ahead of a planned expansion of the war in Gaza. Agence France-Presse reports that Israel Katz’s defence ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that deliberations conducted by chief of staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir on military appointments “took place... without prior coordination or agreement” with the minister. The statement added that this was “in violation of accepted procedure” and that Katz therefore “does not intend to discuss or approve any of the appointments or names that were published.” In an army statement published shortly afterwards, Zamir responded that he was “the sole authority authorised to appoint officers from the rank of colonel upwards”. “The chief of staff makes the appointment decisions - after which the appointment is brought to the minister for approval,” the statement added. Tensions have been simmering for two weeks between the chief of staff and Benjamin Netanyahu’s government over the next steps in the military operation in Gaza, aimed at freeing the remaining hostages and defeating Hamas. Israeli media reported that Zamir was opposed to a plan approved by the security cabinet on Friday to take control of all of Gaza City, instead favouring encircling it. The Council of Europe urged its member states on Tuesday to halt deliveries of weapons to Israel if they could be used for human rights violations. Michael O’Flaherty, the Council’s commissioner for human rights, said member states should do “their utmost to prevent and address violations of international human rights” in the conflict. “This includes applying existing legal standards to ensure that arms transfers are not authorised where there is a risk that they may be used to commit human rights violations,” he said, in a statement. It was also “essential to intensify efforts to provide relief to those affected by the conflict, by supporting efforts to ensure unhindered access for humanitarian assistance and by pressing for the immediate release of hostages,” O’Flaherty said. The call by the Council – a human rights organisation representing 46 states – comes shortly after Germany said it would halt delivery to Israel of some weapons that could be used in Gaza as part of Israeli plans to take control of Gaza City. O’Flaherty said the Council had taken note of this and other government initiatives, and also of contributions by some national human rights structures in raising awareness. “However, more needs to be done, and quickly,” he said. The Elders group of international stateswomen and statesmen for the first time on Tuesday called the situation in Gaza an “unfolding genocide”, saying that Israel’s obstruction of aid was causing a “famine”. “Today we express our shock and outrage at Israel’s deliberate obstruction of the entry of life-saving humanitarian aid into Gaza,” the non-governmental group of public figures, founded by former South Africa president Nelson Mandela in 2007, said in a statement after delegates visited border crossings in Egypt. “What we saw and heard underlines our personal conviction that there is not only an unfolding, human-caused famine in Gaza. There is an unfolding genocide.” Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand, called on Israel to open the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza so aid could be delivered, after visiting the site. “Many new mothers are unable to feed themselves or their newborn babies adequately, and the health system is collapsing,” she said. “All of this threatens the very survival of an entire generation.” Clark was joined by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner for human rights, on the visit. She said that international leaders “have the power and the legal obligation to apply measures to pressure this Israeli government to end its atrocity crimes”. The World Health Organization said Israel should let it stock medical supplies to deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza, before it seizes control of Gaza City, AFP reports. Israel has said its military would “take control” of Gaza City in a plan approved by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet that sparked a wave of global criticism. “We want to stock up, and we all hear about more humanitarian supplies are allowed in – well it’s not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in the Palestinian territories. 52% of medicines were running at zero stock, Peeperkorn said, speaking from Jerusalem. Peeperkorn said the WHO was able to bring in fewer supplies than it wanted “due to the cumbersome procedures” and products “still denied” entry – a topic of constant negotiation with the Israeli authorities. “We want to as quickly stock up hospitals … following the news – the whole discussion about an incursion in Gaza,” he said. “We currently cannot do that … We need to be able to get all essential medicines and medical supplies in.” Peeperkorn said only 50% of hospitals and 38% of primary health care centres were functioning, and even then partially. Bed occupancy has reached 240% capacity in the Al-Shifa hospital and 300% at Al-Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza. “The overall health situation remains catastrophic,” he said. “Hunger and malnutrition continue to ravage Gaza”. At least 89 Palestinians, 31 seeking aid, have been killed and 513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health ministry. Eleven bodies were also recovered from the rubble of previous Israeli attacks, the ministry statement said on the Telegram messaging app. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed a total of 61,599 Palestinians and injured 154,088 since October 7, 2023, the ministry added. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has backed calls for a general strike in solidarity with hostages still held in Gaza, AFP reports. “Strike on Sunday,” Lapid posted on X, saying even supporters of the current government should take part and insisting it was not party political. “Strike out of solidarity. Strike because the families have asked, and that’s reason enough. Strike because no one has a monopoly on emotion, on mutual responsibility, on Jewish values.” Sunday is the first day of the working week in Israel. Lapid’s post followed a call on Sunday by around 20 parents of hostages still held by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip for a strike. On Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main representative group for relatives, backed the idea. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes on Gaza City have intensified in recent days, following prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet approving plans to expand the war there, AFP reports. The Israeli government has not provided an exact timetable on when its forces would enter the area, but according to the civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal, air strikes on Gaza City have been increasing for the past three days. Bassal said the residential neighbourhoods of Zeitoun and Sabra have been hit “with very heavy airstrikes targeting civilian homes, possibly including high-rise buildings”. “For the third consecutive day, the Israeli occupation is intensifying its bombardment,” said the spokesman. “The Israeli occupation is using all types of weapons in that area - bombs, drones, and also highly explosive munitions that cause massive destruction to civilian homes,” he added. Bassal said that at least 24 people had been killed across Gaza on Tuesday, including several casualties caused by strikes on Gaza City. “The bombardment has been extremely intense for the past two days. With every strike, the ground shakes. There are martyrs under the rubble that no one can reach because the shelling hasn’t stopped,” said Majed al-Hosary, a resident in Zeitoun. AFP provides some analysis on what Israel’s military can expect to face in its new offensive on Gaza City: In a dense urban landscape, with likely thousands of Hamas fighters lying in wait, taking Gaza City will be a difficult and costly slog for the Israeli army, security experts say. On Sunday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out his vision of victory in Gaza following 22 months of war – with the military ordered to attack the last remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza City and the central camps further south. Amir Avivi, a former Israeli general and head of the Israeli Defense and Security Forum think tank, described the city as the “heart of Hamas’s rule in Gaza”. “Gaza City has always been the centre of government and also has the strongest brigade of Hamas,” he said. According to Michael Milshtein, who heads the Palestinian Studies Program at Tel Aviv University, Hamas’s military wing could have as many as 10,000 to 15,000 fighters in Gaza City, many of them freshly recruited. “It’s very easy to convince a 17, 18, 19-year-old Palestinian to be a part of Al-Qassam Brigades,” Milshtein told AFP. Other obstacles could include improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and the use of civilians as human shields in a dense urban maze of narrow alleys and tall buildings, according to press reports. “It’s almost impossible to go in there without creating both hostage casualties and a large humanitarian disaster,” said Mairav Zonszein of the International Crisis Group. “They will simply destroy everything, and then nothing will be left,” she said. Israeli planes and tanks kept bombarding eastern areas of Gaza City overnight, killing at least 11 people, witnesses and medics said, Reuters reports. Witnesses and medics said the Israeli military pounded eastern districts of Gaza City again overnight, killing seven people in two houses in the Zeitoun suburb and four in an apartment building in the city centre. In the south of the territory, five people including a couple and their child were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of Khan Younis and four by a strike on a tent encampment in nearby Mawasi, medics said. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports and that its forces take precautions to mitigate civilian harm. Separately, it said that its forces had killed dozens of militants in north Gaza over the past month and destroyed more tunnels used by militants in the area. In a post on X, Israel Defense Forces claim to have “debunked” what it called Hamas’s “starvation campaign” in Gaza. The IDF said that reviews of documents showed that most deaths by malnutrition in Gaza were linked to “severe pre-existing conditions” and that only a handful of the 133 deaths by malnutrition claimed by Gaza’s authorities in July could be “verified”. The post said that the “expert review concluded that there are no signs of a widespread malnutrition phenomenon among the population in Gaza”. While these claims could not be independently verified, the Guardian’s reporting has covered the growing starvation crisis in Gaza. The UN has said Gaza is facing “starvation, pure and simple”. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a “large proportion” of Gaza’s population was starving. As reported earlier this morning, Gaza’s health ministry recorded “five deaths due to famine and malnutrition over the past 24 hours, including two children”, bringing the total number of hunger-related deaths recorded since 7 October, 2023 to 227, including 103 children. Writing after Israel killed six journalists in Gaza on Sunday night, including five Al Jazeera staff members, Hind Khoudary, an Al Jazeera journalist working in Gaza said: “Even though Anas (al-Sharif) has been assassinated, even though Mohammed (Qreiqeh) has been killed, there are many more Palestinian journalists willing to follow in their footsteps, and report on what is happening in those areas. This has been very hard on every single Palestinian journalist. Their funeral yesterday was very sad; people in the streets were crying and calling out, “Where did you go and leave us, Anas?” Palestinians feel they have lost a part of themselves and a member of their family. This has been very hard on us, but we are going to continue reporting. Gaza City will not be silenced.” Norway’s $2tn sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has said it expects to divest from more Israeli companies as part of its ongoing review of investments in the country over the situation in Gaza and the West Bank, Reuters reports The fund announced on Monday it was terminating contracts with external asset managers handling some of its Israeli investments and has divested parts of its portfolio in the country. The review began last week following media reports that the fund had built a stake of just over 2% in an Israeli jet engine group that provides services to Israel’s armed forces, including the maintenance of fighter jets. The stake in the company, Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd (BSEL), has now been sold, the fund announced. Bet Shemesh did not respond to requests for comment. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), an arm of Norway’s central bank, which held stakes in 61 Israeli companies as of 30 June, in recent days divested stakes in 11 firms, including BSEL. It did not name the other companies. “We expect to divest from more companies,” NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen told a press conference on Tuesday. Gaza’s health ministry has recorded “five deaths due to famine and malnutrition over the past 24 hours, including two children”. This brings the total number of hunger-related deaths recorded since 7 October, 2023 to 227, including 103 children. The UN has warned Gaza is "experiencing “starvation, pure and simple” as Israel gears up for a renewed offensive in the territory. A Hamas delegation is holding talks with Egyptian officials in Cairo to repair their relationship after it deteriorated last week, Egyptian and Palestinian sources told Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Khalil al-Hayya, a high-ranking Hamas figure in Qatar, had hinted Egyptians should rise up in protest of the starvation in Gaza, leading to tensions between Hamas and Egypt. “Netanyahu is setting conditions for surrender and is not hinting at any change in his position, so the round of talks is starting with little hope,” a source told the newspaper. Meanwhile, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are working on a nnew ceasefire and hostage-release plan to be presented to Hamas, according to a report by Sky News Arabia. The UN agency for Palestine, Unrwa, has warned that Gaza’s children face becoming a “lost generation” as conflict has robbed them of education. “The longer children in Gaza are out of school, the greater the risk of a lost generation. Every day away from the classroom takes away the future they deserve. The consequences of this war are long term for Gaza’s children. A ceasefire is the first step to getting them back to school,” the agency said in a post on X. The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said that according to the latest satellite-based damage assessment in July, 97% of educational facilities in Gaza have sustained some level of damage with 91% requiring major rehabilitation or complete reconstruction to become functional again. Australia prime minister Anthony Albanese said his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu was “in denial” about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a day after announcing Australia would recognise a Palestinian state for the first time, Reuters reports. Australia will recognise a Palestinian state at next month’s United Nations General Assembly, Albanese said on Monday, a move that adds to international pressure on Israel after similar announcements from France, the UK and Canada. Albanese said the Netanyahu government’s reluctance to listen to its allies contributed to Australia‘s decision to recognise a Palestinian state. “He again reiterated to me what he has said publicly as well, which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for innocent people,” Albanese said in an interview with state broadcaster ABC, recounting a Thursday phone call with Netanyahu discussing the issue. Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state is conditional on commitments received from the Palestinian Authority, including that Islamist militant group Hamas would have no involvement in any future state. Right-leaning opposition leader Sussan Ley said the move, which breaks with long-held bipartisan policy over Israel and the Palestinian territories, risked jeopardising Australia’s relationship with the US. People gathered in cities around the world to protest the Israeli killing of six journalists in Gaza. Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said now is not the time to recognise a Palestinian state. Blinken, who served under president Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, argued in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that the focus should be on the release of Israeli hostages, bringing humanitarian aid into Gaza and the withdrawal of the IDF from the Palestinian territory. Blinken said the decision by France, the UK and other countries to recognise a Palestinian state is “morally right and reflects a global consensus,” but added that doing so without requiring the removal of Hamas from power “would fortify proponents of terror on the Palestinian side and rejectionists of Palestinian statehood on the Israeli side.” Israel has stepped up bombing in Gaza despite global outcry over the killing of six journalists in the territory on Sunday night. Israeli forces killed at least 55 people across the Gaza Strip over Sunday night and into Monday, including a well-known journalist Israel said was a Hamas militant, as well as people seeking humanitarian aid, according to local health officials. Hospital officials reported at least 34 people were killed on Monday, not including the six journalists who were slain in a tent shortly before midnight. More than 15 people were killed while waiting for aid at the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza, said Fares Awad, head of the ambulance services in northern Gaza. Israel’s military did not immediately respond to questions about the deaths. Earlier on Monday, it said air and artillery units were operating in northern Gaza and in Khan Younis, where resident Noha Abu Shamala told AP that two drone strikes killed a family of seven in their apartment. Other key events include: Palestinians reported the heaviest bombardments in weeks on Monday in areas east of Gaza City, just hours after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected to complete a new expanded offensive in the territory “fairly quickly”. The EU condemned the killing of five Al Jazeera journalists in an Israeli airstrike outside Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City, including Al Jazeera correspondent Anas Al Sharif. “We take note of the Israeli allegation that the group was Hamas terrorists, but there is a need in these cases to provide clear evidence, in the respect of rule of law, to avoid targeting of journalists,” foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in a statement on X. The EU joins the UN, Reporters Without Borders, the Foreign Press Association and a host of other organisations in denouncing the attack. Palestinians in Gaza gathered on Monday for the funeral of the five Al Jazeera staff members and a sixth reporter killed in an Israeli strike. Dozens stood amid bombed-out buildings in the courtyard of Al-Shifa hospital to pay their respects to Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera correspondent aged 28, and four of his colleagues, killed on Sunday. Video footage appears to show the moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month. The video released Sunday by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, shows Israeli settler Yinon Levi firing a gun toward the person filming. The footage cuts but the camera keeps rolling as the person moans in pain.
