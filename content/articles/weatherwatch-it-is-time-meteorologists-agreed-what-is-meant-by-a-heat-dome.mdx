  Some forecasters attributed the recent warm weather to a “heat dome”. This
  sounds like a technical term, but the expression is not used in scientific
  circles and some question whether it should be used at all. Loosely speaking,
  a heat dome occurs when a stationary mass of high-pressure air forms over a
  region. This has a doming effect, blocking more warm air from rising, which
  raises pressure and temperature further. A 2016 Guardian piece discussed how
  the term “heat dome” was starting to be used by American forecasters
  describing extreme conditions. One science editor complained that the new term
  was employed “with a kind of breathlessness that implies there is something
  unusual and catastrophic going on”. Others thought that it was helpful in
  describing the mechanism causing especially high temperatures. In 2019 the Met
  Office described “heat dome” as “not a meteorological term that is recognised
  professionally”. But the expression took off, particularly in media
  discussions of the June 2021 Pacific north-west heatwave. In 2022 the American
  Meteorological Society added “heat dome” to its glossary of terms. Technically
  correct or not, “heat dome” is here to stay. A recent paper by the American
  Meteorological Society argues that the best course for meteorologists would be
  to agree a rigorous definition and get the media to use it correctly.
