  When Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump meet in Alaska, the Russian president
  will set out to woo his US counterpart and dangle financial incentives for
  siding with Moscow over Ukraine. The hastily arranged summit, organised at
  Putin’s request, will be his first invitation to meet a US president on
  American soil since he visited George W Bush in 2007. The surprise
  announcement caught Kyiv and its European allies off guard but for Putin it
  signals a preliminary diplomatic victory: a face to face with Trump requiring
  no concessions, and a step towards his goal of deciding Ukraine’s future at
  the table with Washington. Key to Putin’s message on Friday will be an appeal
  to Trump’s business instincts. On Thursday, the Russian president’s adviser
  Yuri Ushakov said the leaders would discuss the “huge untapped potential” in
  Russia–US economic relations. “An exchange of views is expected on further
  developing bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic sphere,”
  Ushakov said. “This cooperation has huge and, unfortunately so far, untapped
  potential.” Notably, alongside a cadre of veteran diplomats, Putin is bringing
  two prominent economic advisers. The inclusion of the finance minister, Anton
  Siluanov, is particularly notable: he has led Russia’s response to western
  sanctions, the removal of which the Kremlin has consistently set as a key
  condition for any peace deal. “Putin sees this as a chance to show Trump that
  he is more than ready to agree to peace if the conditions are right. He wants
  to portray [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy as the one prolonging the war,”
  said a former high-ranking Kremlin official who, like several other sources,
  spoke on condition of anonymity. “Putin knows Trump sees the world through a
  business lens, and will pitch a peace on his terms as the gateway to lucrative
  opportunities,” the former official added. If past encounters between the two
  leaders are any guide, it may be Putin, the former KGB operative, who edges
  the upper hand in Alaska. “Trump is exactly the kind of leader Putin believes
  he can always strike a deal with, an authoritarian in the mould of [Recep
  Tayyip] Erdoğan, Xi Jinping or [Narendra] Modi,” said a Russian academic close
  to the foreign ministry, citing the leaders of Turkey, China and India
  respectively. Analysts and insiders say the summit, convened after weeks of
  largely fruitless talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey, has been
  organised on too short a timescale to deliver any meaningful outcome. Russia’s
  foreign ministry reiterated on Wednesday that Putin’s conditions for ending
  the war remained unchanged: the full withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from key
  regions and the renunciation of Kyiv’s Nato ambitions. Kyiv has ruled out
  these demands from the outset. “This is not a final summit where lasting peace
  can be achieved,” said a member of the Russian foreign policy establishment
  who advises Putin. “Not enough groundwork has been laid for that. But it does
  offer a rare chance to win Trump over to Russia’s side.” Trump has been
  unusually careful not to raise expectations on the outcome. On Monday, he
  described the talks as a “feel-out” to determine whether a peace deal was
  possible. “I may say ‘lots of luck, keep fighting’ or I may say we can make a
  deal,” the president said. The next day, the White House press secretary,
  Karoline Leavitt, described the meeting as a “listening exercise” and said
  there was no specific outcome Washington could predict. What is clear is that
  for both leaders the summit comes at an opportune moment. In recent weeks,
  Trump’s rhetoric towards Putin had hardened: he accused the Kremlin leader of
  feeding Washington “a lot of bullshit” and issued a public ultimatum, warning
  that continued fighting in Ukraine would spark sanctions. In Moscow, there was
  a growing sense that sustained European lobbying on behalf of Kyiv was
  beginning to have an effect. But Putin brushed off Trump’s outburst, keen to
  keep channels with the US president open. For Trump, the summit offers a
  convenient off-ramp from imposing sanctions for which he had little appetite
  in the first place. In recent days, Trump has reverted to his more familiar
  posture of criticising Zelenskyy and striking a milder tone with Putin – an
  attitude that emerged after his envoy Steve Witkoff met the Russian leader in
  the Kremlin last Wednesday. Details of that meeting remain murky and at times
  contradictory. Witkoff, who often travels to Russia alone and without his own
  interpreters, is believed to have floated a proposal for Kyiv to cede full
  control of two regions in eastern Ukraine – Luhansk and Donetsk – in exchange
  for a ceasefire. Luhansk is almost completely occupied by Russia but Ukraine
  still controls a large portion of Donetsk, which it would have to voluntarily
  give up under this plan. Witkoff initially told European partners that Russia
  was prepared to give up the territory it controlled in southern Ukraine. But
  after further talks with European leaders, it emerged that Moscow had no
  intention of ceding any land; instead it insisted that Kyiv surrender the
  areas it holds in the Donbas in return for a ceasefire that would lock in the
  frontlines elsewhere. This idea has since coloured much of Trump’s pre-summit
  rhetoric, with the US leader telling the media he intends to pursue a form of
  “land swapping” to end the war. In Alaska, Putin is likely to push for full
  control and US recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as Russian territory, two
  sources in Moscow said. Kyiv still holds key cities in Donetsk, such as
  Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, along with heavily fortified positions of critical
  strategic importance whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives. All
  sources consulted said Russia was highly unlikely to relinquish territory it
  held in southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which forms a vital land bridge
  from the Donbas along the Sea of Azov to Crimea. Russia claims to have annexed
  all four regions plus the Crimean peninsula, which it captured in 2014. Moscow
  could offer to relinquish small slivers of Ukrainian land it captured in the
  Kharkiv and Sumy regions. While Kyiv is unlikely to renounce its legal claim
  to the occupied regions, it is generally understood it could accept a freezing
  of the frontlines. Zelenskyy stressed on Tuesday that Ukraine could not agree
  to a Russian proposal to give up more of his country’s territory in exchange
  for a ceasefire because Moscow could use what it gained as a springboard to
  start a future war. “We find ourselves at a total dead end,” said the former
  Kremlin official, summing up the current standoff. “In Moscow, the view is
  that Trump can pressure Ukraine into giving up its land. But Kyiv has shown
  independence.” Even if a provisional agreement could be reached on territory,
  peace would still appear distant, given Russia’s other maximalist demands.
  “Trump seems to be under the illusion that Putin only cares about the land,”
  said the former official. They argued that the Trump administration had yet to
  grasp that from the outset, territory was secondary to Ukraine’s independence
  and Putin’s “root causes” that led him to invade. Those “root causes” that
  Putin often refers to include his demands for Ukraine’s formal renunciation of
  Nato membership as well as its “demilitarisation” and “denazification” – a
  vague set of demands that in practice amount to the removal of Zelenskyy. The
  timing of the summit works in Putin’s favour. This week, Russian forces made a
  sudden push into eastern Ukraine, a move seen as an attempt to increase
  pressure on Kyiv to concede territory and to reinforce Putin’s negotiating
  position. “Given that the situation is developing in Russia’s favour, there
  must be some major incentives for Putin to stop the fighting,” said the
  Russian academic close to the foreign ministry. “Putin believes that if
  diplomacy fails, he can simply press ahead militarily.” But even with
  expectations low, there are risks for Putin. Leaving Trump empty-handed could
  provoke the unpredictable US leader. Andrey Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based
  political analyst, said Trump’s patience may not last indefinitely. “Putin is
  stalling for time but there comes a point when it is no longer possible to
  stall,” Kolesnikov said. “At some stage he will have to give something.” One
  possibility, sources suggest, is that Putin agrees to a temporary halt on
  long-range strikes. But the Russian leader is unlikely to accept a full
  ceasefire unless his conditions are met. Whatever the outcome, Kolesnikov
  said, on Friday Putin will find himself exactly where he wants to be. “Putin
  has a messianic streak in everything he does,” he said. “He wants to carve up
  the world into spheres of influence with Trump and Xi. A new Yalta is his
  dream.”
