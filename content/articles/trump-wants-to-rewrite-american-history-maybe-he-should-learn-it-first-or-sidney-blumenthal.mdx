  Of all the presidents, Donald Trump – the man who would remake the Smithsonian
  and alter its presentation of “how bad slavery was”, as he put it – is surely
  the most ignorant of American history itself. What Trump doesn’t know fills
  the Library of Congress, whose chief librarian he has fired, along with
  driving out the heads of the National Archives and the National Portrait
  Gallery, as well as dissolving programs of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities and defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which as a
  result has paused the acclaimed American Experience documentary series. Trump
  claims he is tearing down the entire federal support for history in order to
  reveal the true story. In his executive order of 27 March, “Restoring Truth
  and Sanity to American History”, he stated: “Over the past decade, Americans
  have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s
  history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by
  ideology rather than truth.” The “improper ideology” that needs to be
  extirpated is a “divisive, race-centered ideology”. The White House issued a
  memo on 21 August, titled “President Trump Is Right About the Smithsonian”,
  citing a broad swath of scattered incidents ranging from “wokeness” to
  representations of immigration to a picture of the former leading health
  official Anthony Fauci, who is anathema to the right. Trump appointed a review
  panel to be headed by his vice-president, JD Vance, and the attorney and White
  House staffer Lindsey Halligan, who is actually the one in charge of the
  project. Echoing Trump, she explained: “We don’t need to overemphasize the
  negative to teach people that certain aspects of our nation’s history may have
  been bad.” She told Fox News, “What I saw when I was going through the museum,
  personally, was an overemphasis on slavery, and I think there should be more
  of an overemphasis on how far we’ve come since slavery.” A Trump White House
  aide elaborated: “President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get
  the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable.” The aide had the
  Trump formula down pat: after the purge comes the retribution. Trump tweeted:
  “I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact
  same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where
  tremendous progress has been made.” When Trump met on 28 August with Lonnie
  Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian and founding director of the
  Smithsonian’s African American Museum of History, he brought along Halligan as
  his expert. Her credentials for this crucial assignment in the culture war –
  after twice competing in the Miss Colorado USA beauty pageant, then becoming
  an insurance lawyer in Florida – must have been her work as one of Trump’s
  attorneys involved in the case over classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Trump
  initially noticed her at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach
  in 2021. She is now, in addition to her other duties, the de facto Trump White
  House historian-in-residence. She told the Washington Post she was interested
  in the civil war and westward expansion. A former colleague described her as
  “a fan of history”. Beyond Halligan’s comments in a letter about packaging the
  past into a palatable Happy Meal of “ideals” and “Americanism”, the
  administration did not present its actual alternative history or the policies
  that flow from it. Trump bellowed that the Smithsonian contained “Nothing
  about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future”. But this
  gospel of positive-thinking twaddle aside, Trump, proudly ignorant though he
  is, has for years articulated a vision of American history. That vision does
  not emphasize the strides the nation has made through tumultuous struggle
  since the abolition of slavery. Instead, it honors the those who defended
  slavery, committed treason to preserve it and claim it to be a worthy American
  “heritage”. Trump has repeatedly sought to shield the Confederate statues and
  symbols erected as tribute to the “lost cause” myth. He has expressed and
  unqualified admiration for Robert E Lee as a quintessential American hero
  almost always coupled with belittling remarks about Lincoln. His view of
  history squarely aligns him with neo-Confederates, not least those who carried
  the Confederate flag at the US Capitol during the insurrection on 6 January
  2021 and whom he subsequently pardoned. Trump’s version of history is not,
  however, simply reactionary nostalgia, or treacly kitsch for the restoration
  of “Uncle Herschel”, the “Old-Timer” to the Cracker Barrel logo. His use of
  the culture war is a key element to advance his policy agenda. After the civil
  war, in reaction to Reconstruction, the southern slaveholding oligarchy
  regrouped to form the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist militias, most under
  the direction of former Confederate officers, to destroy the possibilities of
  emancipation and civil rights in the name of what they called “redemption”.
  Nearly a century later, the civil rights revolution of the 1960s overthrew the
  southern segregationist regime to restore and expand the enforcement of the
  original civil war amendments to the US constitution – the 14th amendment
  securing equal protection under the law and birthright citizenship and the
  15th amendment protecting Black voting rights. The great southern historian C
  Vann Woodward called the civil rights movement the Second Reconstruction.
  Trump’s neo-Confederate culture war is the symbolic cover for his full-scale
  political assault on those civil war amendments and the further enactment of
  their intent in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of
  1965. He is directing a second redemption to tear down the Second
  Reconstruction. The attack on the constitution has been swift, comprehensive
  and sharply partisan. Trump is seeking to nullify birthright citizenship in
  the 14th amendment. He is challenging the Voting Rights Act and abandoning
  previous justice department positions on the constitutionality of remedying
  racially discriminatory voting maps in support of arguments in the supreme
  court case Louisiana v Callais. In fear of losing Republican control of the
  Congress in the 2026 elections, he has encouraged states to ignore the
  practice of redistricting congressional districts based on the census and
  instead to redraw racially discriminatory lines to create new Republican
  seats. He has dismantled the civil rights division of the justice department.
  Seventy per cent of its attorneys have been fired or driven to resign. His
  administration has planned to close the Community Relations Service, a unit
  created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to mediate racial tensions. He has
  withdrawn from numerous justice department lawsuits challenging voter
  suppression laws. He has issued an executive order to prevent federal agencies
  from enforcing regulations forbidding “disparate impact” discrimination. He
  has attacked grants, contracts and programs related to diversity, equity and
  inclusion (DEI), with his justice department creating an Orwellian-named
  “civil rights fraud initiative” to target what his agents choose to define as
  illegal DEI practices, and use it to leverage control over universities, law
  firms and private businesses. Perhaps no official presidential statement
  exemplifies Trump’s adherence to the “lost cause” mythology more flagrantly
  than his veto of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, which
  included the creation of the National Naming Commission to remove names
  honoring the Confederacy from nine federal military forts and thousands of
  other assets. “I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated
  attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress
  our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles,” Trump
  stated. The House and the Senate overwhelmingly overrode his veto. Once Trump
  reassumed office, he authorized wiping away the new names, some of them of
  Black soldiers, and reinstated the old last names of Confederate generals at
  the forts but with the cynical twist of claiming they were really for
  different people with the same names. The secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth,
  who called the National Naming Commission “woke lemmings” and its changes
  “garbage”, said: “Unlike the left, we recognize our history, we don’t erase
  it.” He announced the return of the Confederate memorial at the Arlington
  national cemetery, whose frieze depicts a faithful enslaved woman taking care
  of a Confederate soldier’s child as he marches off to battle. In the West
  Point library, the Pentagon has rehung the 20ft-tall portrait of Robert E Lee
  in his gray Confederate uniform with a faithful enslaved person tending his
  horse, Traveller, in the background. Trump’s vision of restored “Americanism”
  might be found in the preserved “lost cause” wing of the Virginia Museum of
  History in Richmond, an exhibit originally constructed in 1921 by the
  Confederate Memorial Association, with huge murals of Lee and Stonewall
  Jackson as gallant cavaliers. The eulogizing of “the Four Seasons of the
  Confederacy” is now reframed with contemporary texts to explain the post-civil
  war romanticizing of the slave republic. The exhibit also features a widely
  circulated “lost cause” pamphlet published by the United Confederate Veterans
  in 1919 that urged southern school districts: “Reject a book that says the
  South fought to hold her slaves … Reject a book that glorifies Abraham Lincoln
  and vilifies Jefferson Davis.” For perspective, around the corner from this
  exhibit, the Virginia Museum of History has stationed the white hood and sheet
  of a Ku Klux Klansman. In 2020 and 2021, the row of five towering Confederate
  statues along Richmond’s Monument Avenue of Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall
  Jackson, Jeb Stuart, and Matthew Fontaine Maury, erected as “lost cause” icons
  during the Jim Crow era, were removed. In the interest of “Restoring Truth and
  Sanity to American History”, the Smithsonian would do well to mount a proper
  exhibit dedicated to Trump’s historical ignorance and his “divisive
  race-centered ideology”. The exhibit could begin with a kind of preface,
  posting the remarks of Trump’s chief of staff in his first administration, the
  former marine general John Kelly, who revealed Trump to be the
  ignoramus-in-chief. “He doesn’t know any history at all, even some of the
  basics on the US,” Kelly said. Trump reportedly told Kelly that Adolf Hitler
  “did a lot of good things”. He also reportedly said he needed “the kind of
  generals that Hitler had”, people “who were totally loyal to him, that follow
  orders”. (Trump representatives deny he made the remarks.) Kelly described the
  conversation to Jeffrey Goldberg in the Atlantic: “‘Do you mean Bismarck’s
  generals?’” Kelly asked. “‘Do you mean the Kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t
  mean Hitler’s generals?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.’” Trump
  asked Kelly who the “good guys” were in the first world war. Then the exhibit
  might move on to President William McKinley, whom Trump lately has invoked as
  the “tariff king” to justify his own tariffs, largely ruled illegal so far by
  the courts. Trump seems to care about no other aspect of McKinley or his
  presidency – say, the Spanish-American War – while he has revived his memory
  by removing the Native American name of Mount Denali in Alaska and renaming it
  Mount McKinley. Trump has ignored McKinley’s second thoughts about tariffs,
  including his final speech before his assassination in 1901, in which he
  abjured severe tariffs. But how would Trump know that? Next the exhibit would
  devote ample space to Trump’s relationship to Abraham Lincoln, the one
  president Trump has discussed more than any other. In 2018, as Trump’s poll
  ratings dived, he tweeted: “Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the
  Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.” Of
  course, there were no polls in Lincoln’s time. In 2019, Trump stated: “The
  radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it … Abraham Lincoln
  could not win Texas under those circumstances.” In fact, Lincoln’s name was
  kept off the ballot in Texas in the 1860 election and, of course, in 1864 when
  Texas was part of the Confederacy. In 2020, staging an interview with Fox News
  within the Lincoln Memorial, Trump used Lincoln as a prop to elevate himself
  as a greater martyr. “They always said, ‘Lincoln, nobody got treated worse
  than Lincoln.’ I believe I am treated worse.” He apparently had forgotten
  Lincoln’s assassination. On the third anniversary of the January 6
  insurrection, in 2024, he appeared to blame Lincoln for the civil war. “So
  many mistakes were made,” Trump said. “See, there was something I think could
  have been negotiated, to be honest with you. I think you could have negotiated
  that. All the people died, so many people died. You know, that was the
  disaster … Abraham Lincoln, of course, if he negotiated it, you probably
  wouldn’t even know who Abraham Lincoln was.” Of course, Lincoln held out an
  olive branch in his first inaugural address, appealing to the “mystic chords
  of memory” and “the better angels of our nature”, which was met a month later
  with the firing on Fort Sumter. But in Trump’s view he had failed the art of
  the deal. He was the 19th century’s Zelenskyy. Then the exhibit would come to
  Robert E Lee. In the aftermath of the neo-Nazi rally at Charlottesville in
  2017 in which 35 people were injured and a young woman was murdered, about
  which Trump infamously said there were “some very fine people on both sides”,
  he defended Confederate monuments against a protest to remove a statue of Lee
  that had been erected as a tribute to the “lost cause”. “Sad to see the
  history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal
  of our beautiful statues and monuments,” he tweeted. “So,” he said at a rally
  in 2018, “Robert E Lee was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a
  phobia, he couldn’t beat Robert E Lee. He was going crazy … but Robert E Lee
  was winning battle after battle after battle and Abraham Lincoln came home and
  he said, ‘I can’t beat Robert E Lee.’” Lincoln had a clear and firm opinion
  about Lee. He considered him a traitor. Naming Lee high among officers of the
  army who had betrayed their oath to the United States, Lincoln wrote on 12
  June 1863 that they were “now occupying the very highest places in the rebel
  war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion
  began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now”. Lincoln
  wrote: “I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed” for not
  having arrested Lee and the others when their treasonous intent was known
  before they had joined the Confederacy to lead an armed insurrection against
  the United States. Of course, there is a memorial on the estate overlooking
  Washington where Lee lived before the war. Quartermaster General Montgomery
  Meigs, who had been a West Point classmate and friend of Lee, declared those
  grounds the Arlington national cemetery in 1864, planting the first graves of
  fallen soldiers in the rose garden as close to the house as possible, to
  ensure that Lee would never return. Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser
  to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a
  projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man,
