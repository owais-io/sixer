  Borderlands 4 The boisterous “looter shooter” series returns, bringing
  ridiculously powerful weapons, a cool new hoverbike and a vast planet to
  explore, while dealing with the threat of a ruthless cosmic dictator known as
  the Timekeeper. It’s been five years since the last instalment, and developer
  Gearbox has massively updated the signature cartoon visuals to bring us the
  next generation of sci-fi comic book anarchy. • Released 12 September; PC,
  PS5, Xbox, Switch (3 October) Silent Hill f Looking to scare yourself stupid
  as the long dark nights draw in? The first completely new instalment in
  Konami’s psychological horror series for over a decade has been cautiously
  welcomed by fans – but the proof will be in the (extremely bloody) pudding.
  Set in 1960s Japan, it follows high-school student Hinako Shimizu as her home
  town becomes shrouded in a dense fog filled with freakish monsters. • 25
  September; PC, PS5, Xbox EA Sports FC 26 The superlative footie simulation
  heads back on to the pitch, sporting a revived game engine with an emphasis on
  fluid animation, super smart computer-controlled teammates and of course
  accurate up-to-date teams and players. Designed in conjunction with fans and
  pro footballers it’s a marked improvement on last year’s edition. • 26
  September; PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Ghost of Yōtei The sequel to acclaimed
  samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima takes place 300 years later in the early
  17th century, with vengeful ronin Atsu on the trail of a renegade samurai
  warlord and his clan. Expect another sombre and challenging epic, combining
  authentic combat and leisurely exploration beneath the beautiful and imposing
  Mount Yōtei. • 2 October; PS5 Battlefield 6 Billed as a spiritual successor to
  the excellent Battlefield 4, this pulverising first-person shooter is set
  during a modern-day global conflict, abandoning the sci-fi shenanigans of its
  predecessor, Battlefield 2042. Early previews of the game’s online multiplayer
  mode have been promising, with incredibly intense battles and detailed scenic
  destruction. • 10 October; PC, PS5, Xbox Pokémon Legends: Z-A If you need a
  little light in your life as the evenings darken, Nintendo and developer Game
  Freak have the answer, a fresh instalment in the Pokémon series, set in the
  French-themed Lumiose City, a peaceful place to explore during the day, a hive
  of ambitious Pokémon trainers at night. Expect the usual blend of cosiness and
  gentle challenge. • 16 October; Switch Keeper So few video games these days
  give you the chance to play as a sentient lighthouse with a friendly seabird
  assistant – thank goodness kooky San Francisco studio Double Fine is here to
  address the shortfall. It promises an emotional tale of companionship and
  metamorphosis, set in a mythical seaside realm. • 17 October; PC, Xbox Ninja
  Gaiden 4 Set in a near-future Tokyo awash with the blood of fallen warriors,
  the latest hack-and-slash adventure from Team Ninja dials up the gore and
  introduces a new character, the young ninja prodigy Yakumo. This is an
  unapologetically tough old-school brawler, designed to be played at a
  lightning pace. • 21 October; PC, PS5, Xbox Once Upon a Katamari Created by
  designer and artist Keita Takahashi, the Katamari series of surreal puzzle
  games require players to collect a variety of familiar objects into huge balls
  in order to repair broken planets. Once Upon a Katamari is the first new
  instalment for 14 years, bringing a whole new generation into this bright,
  weird and funny universe. • 24 October; PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Goodnight
  Universe Nice Dream, the LA-based team behind Bafta award-winning game Before
  Your Eyes, returns with another offbeat, emotionally intelligent adventure,
  this time centring on six-month-old baby Isaac whose burgeoning psychic powers
  capture the attention of a shadowy government agency. Like its predecessor,
  the game makes interesting use of webcams, lending a cinéma vérité feel to the
  narrative. • 11 November; PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox
