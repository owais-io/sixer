  A pro-Palestine protest that plans to march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge
  will go ahead with legal protection after its organisers won a supreme court
  challenge. The court heard up to 50,000 people were expected to attend – the
  same number of people who marched across the bridge for World Pride in 2023.
  New South Wales police sought powers to move on protesters and expressed
  serious concerns about the disruption a large protest on the bridge would have
  on the city. But Justice Belinda Rigg said disruption and inconvenience alone
  were not enough to stifle the right to political protest and noted
  “significant support for the march”. Here are some answers to questions you
  may have about the march, including its planned route, transport disruptions
  and potential risks. The court has ‘authorised’ the protest, what does that
  mean? The ruling means protesters will have immunity from being charged under
  the Summary Offences Act. This includes protection from offences like
  “obstructing traffic” – crucial in this particular protest. However, police
  will still have access to a range of other powers to stem what the court
  described as “antisocial behaviour” or other types of offending. This includes
  showing prohibited symbols. David Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the Human
  Rights Law Centre, said the authorisation “doesn’t give people the ability to
  engage in all types and all forms of activism”. “It’s really important for
  people who do attend that they follow the directions of organisers and
  marshals.” There is no authority to ban protest or deem it unlawful in NSW.
  This is because, while there is no express right to protest in the state, it
  is covered in common law and by the Australian constitution, which the high
  court has found implies the right to freedom of political communication. What
  is planned and how long will the bridge shut down for? The protest will begin
  at 1pm on Sunday at Lang Park in Sydney’s CBD. Protesters will then march
  across the Sydney Harbour Bridge into north Sydney. Early plans shared with
  protesters stated the march would end at the US consulate, but this may
  change. The protest is expected to last several hours. The bridge will be
  closed to traffic from about 11.30am. Police hope it will reopen to traffic
  from about 4pm. They have advised people to avoid the CBD and travel in the
  city unless necessary. Are police still concerned? Yes, but NSW police will
  comply with the court’s decision and say they are working with protest
  organisers to address issues and concerns. A significant police presence will
  be in the city, including officers brought in from across the suburbs. The
  force has said it will also use specialist resources, including the public
  order and riot squad and mounted police. Police have advised the public to
  expect significant disruptions in and around the CBD. What about the
  counter-protest? A counter protest against antisemitism, organised by the
  Christian-led group Never Again is Now, will not be granted legal protection
  because, according to the supreme court, “notice was served less than seven
  days before the proposed assembly”. The group had been planning to protest
  outside the Sydney harbour tunnel, close to the pro-Palestinian march. Rigg
  said police would have the legal power to direct this group to move on or, if
  necessary, arrest demonstrators for non-compliance. These powers will not
  extend to those marching in the pro-Palestine demonstration. What has the
  government said? The state government is yet to respond to the supreme court
  decision. Earlier this week, Chris Minns opposed the protest, saying: “We
  cannot allow Sydney to descend into chaos.” But several NSW Labor MPs defied
  their premier, vowing to attend the march. Labor’s Stephen Lawrence, Anthony
  D’Adam, Lynda Voltz, Cameron Murphy and Sarah Kaine were among 15 NSW
  politicians who signed an open letter on Thursday evening calling on the
  government to facilitate “a safe and orderly event” on Sunday. The state
  opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said while he respected the freedom to
  protest, including with rallies and marches, “allowing the takeover of the
  Harbour Bridge for a protest in the middle of the day sets the wrong precedent
  for the future”. What’s happening in Melbourne? Protesters in Melbourne are
  also planning to blockade the King Street bridge from midday on Sunday in
  solidarity with NSW demonstrators. Event organisers Free Palestine Coalition
  Naarm have urged supporters to “block the city for Gaza” and to bring pots and
  pans to “highlight the manufactured starvation that is causing mass casualties
  in Gaza”. Victoria police on Friday said they had made “repeated requests” for
  protesters to change their plans, as blocking the bridge – which provides a
  major thoroughfare into the city - could delay emergency services. They said
  there would be a visible police presence in the city on Sunday “to keep the
  peace and ensure the safety of the community”. - With Benita Kolovos
