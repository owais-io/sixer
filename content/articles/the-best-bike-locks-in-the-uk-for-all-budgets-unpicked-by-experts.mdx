  Few among us do not have a tale of a stolen bike: you leave work with your
  helmet fastened or come out of a shop after picking up some milk, and your
  bike has disappeared. Tens of thousands of people reported a bike theft to
  police in England and Wales in 2024, so having the right lock is crucial to
  protect your two-wheeler. But just as everyone has their own preferred bike,
  choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is
  very personal. Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their
  bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes),
  and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best
  option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to
  keep your ride secure. What you need to know The Metropolitan police urges
  people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels
  to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the
  saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around
  for some time, so weight is key. The Sold Secure rating system, owned by the
  Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks
  locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the
  more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond
  (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks). Carl Ellis, who
  founded thebestbikelock.com after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t
  recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough
  protection in most cases. So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can
  get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks
  usually costing about £40. If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a
  lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of Stolen Ride, a
  cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft. At a glance

  affordable lock Halfords 23cm D Lock £35 at Halfords Carl Ellis’s pick is the
  Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a
  mount included to attach to the frame of the bike. The only drawback is that
  there is no cable to protect the wheel. If you want this extra piece of
  security, try the OnGuard Pitbull DT 8005, which Ellis says is practically
  sized – big enough to go around the frame and one wheel of most bikes – and
  gives the extra layer of security. Sold Secure rating: gold Weight: not listed
  Number of keys: two Frame mount: included *** Best angle grinder resistant
  lock Hiplok D1000 £249.99 at Hiplok £249.99 at Balfe’s Bikes
  Angle-grinder-resistant bike locks are the security device of choice for some
  riders, and it’s not hard to understand why. “[Angle grinders] can make
  cutting standard locks very quick,” says Richard Cantle. “There are only a
  handful of these specific locks in this new area of the market, from
  well-known companies such as Hiplok, Litelok, and Squire. It’s worth pointing
  out that Sold Secure doesn’t have a specific rating for these locks yet to
  show their angle grinder credentials; they fall under the diamond rating
  category that also includes non angle grinder resistant bike locks.” The most
  accessible of the high-end locks, says Ellis, is the Litelok X1. But he picks
  the Hiplok D1000 as the most angle grinder resistant lock. It comes with a
  lifetime warranty and is fortified with a graphene composite material that
  makes it much more difficult to cut with an angle grinder. Sold Secure rating:
  diamond Weight: 1.9kg Number of keys: three (with registration and replacement
  key programme) Frame mount: no *** Best for city cyclists Kryptonite Evolution
  Mini-7 £44.99 at Halfords £44.99 at Amazon London and other major cities have
  some of the highest rates of bike theft in the UK. Hackney sat at number one
  on that undesirable chart in 2024, followed closely by Hammersmith and Fulham,
  and Cardiff, while Bristol wasn’t far off the top. The city cyclist can first
  look at getting a U-lock, also called a D-lock, which offers the “best price
  to security ratio”, says Ellis. “They’re usually the easiest to use, and since
  cities are full of bike racks, you shouldn’t struggle to find somewhere to
  lock your bike, even with a mini U-lock.” Sam Crabtree, a buyer at Halfords,
  says a good option for city cyclists who need something light on their commute
  is the gold-rated Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7. “It has a sliding dust cover as
  well as a higher-security disc-style cylinder that is pick and drill
  resistant,” he says. “Kryptonite locks offer anti-theft protection cover [on
  bikes] up to a value of £1,500. “The KryptoFlex cable that comes with the
  Mini-7 extends its versatility. The cable allows users to secure additional
  parts of the bike, like the front wheel, or to lock the bike to larger or
  awkwardly shaped objects that the U-lock alone wouldn’t fit around. While the
  cable itself isn’t as secure as the U-lock, it’s a good deterrent for
  opportunistic thieves and adds an extra layer of protection.” Sold Secure

  combination lock Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo £51.99 at Freewheel £53.73 at
  Decathlon The attraction of a combination lock is that you don’t have to
  remember a key. But they’re not as safe as some of those with a key. “Thieves
  can crack the code through trial and error,” says Crabtree. This would, of
  course, take the time to go through all of the possible combinations, which
  would be in the thousands. There are fewer combination locks with high Sold
  Secure ratings, says Ellis. Of those that are available, he says the
  Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo comes with a gold rating and a mount for the frame
  of your bike. “The mount is simple to install and holds the lock firmly in
  place,” he says. “It’s just a good all-round lock that doesn’t require keys.
  You can also register your combination with Kryptonite in case you forget it.”

  Halfords £59.99 at Tredz Even though chain locks can offer high levels of
  security, they’re often too heavy for daily use, says Ellis. Where chain locks
  come into their own is when bikes are locked at home. Admiral says that 40% of
  claims on its policies for stolen bikes are for those taken from sheds and
  garages, and another 25% are taken from inside homes themselves. Ellis
  recommends the gold-rated Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2 chains, which come in
  varying sizes. They also come with the option of a combination lock or a key
  and are a reasonable weight Sold Secure rating: gold Weight: 2.52kg Number of
  keys: two Frame mount: no *** Best lightweight lock Foldylock Mini From £76.98
  at Amazon Cyclists looking for a light lock face a problem – typically,
  security and heaviness go hand and hand. “Chains and U-locks tend to be the
  most secure – however, you pay for this security in weight,” says Crabtree.
  “Cable and folding locks are typically more transportable but tend to offer
  lower security.” The silver-rated Foldylock Mini weighs just under 1kg,
  folding down to a compact and easy-to-carry package, says Ellis. It’s the
  smallest and lightest silver-rated folding lock available, he says, and the
  folding mechanism is smoother than the competition. “Because that compact
  shape is so close to your frame, the lock tends to be kept very firmly in
  place, even on bumpy rides. In contrast, D-locks are always bigger and can
  sometimes be less stable in their frame mounts,” he says. “The other advantage
  of folding locks is that they can be shaped around your bike and whatever
  you’re trying to lock it to.” Sold Secure rating: silver Weight: 0.89kg Number
  of keys: three Frame mount: yes *** Which lock? The different types explained
  D-lock/U-lock This ubiquitous lock can be called by either of its names and
  has been around since the 1970s. It essentially acts as a large padlock and
  comes in varying degrees of strength, security and price. It consists of a
  stiff shackle (the ‘U’ part) and a crossbar that secures it in place. Cable
  lock This lightweight, flexible lock is usually easy to transport. It uses a
  steel cable that can be wound around a bike’s frame and wheels a number of
  times. Best for low-risk areas, as they can be weak and easy to cut with bolt
  cutters. Chain lock This is a chain with locking mechanisms at both ends. This
  can be fed through the bike frame a number of times as well as the bike rack.
  The links and weight of the chain can vary in size and strength. Typically
  covered with a protective sleeve, a chain lock can be bulky so isn’t as
  portable as other types of lock, but it can create problems for thieves trying
  to use power tools. Folding lock These are usually compact and can be attached
  to the frame of the bike when not in use. It’s made from steel plates that can
  be moved around to give different locking combinations and then folded into a
  convenient package that’s easy to transport. However, there aren’t as many
  options on the market as other types of lock. They’re also generally more
  expensive. Bikes: a guide to security Learn to lock up your bike properly.
  Keep the lock as far from the ground as possible – thieves may use the ground
  for leverage – and ensure it goes around both the frame and a wheel. Write
  down your frame number in case your bike is stolen. Register your bike with
  schemes such as Immobilise and the BikeRegister Database, which help identify
  stolen property to the police. Take pictures of your bike, including any
  distinctive features. Get a lock that’s the tightest possible fit – not too
  big that it’s slack, but also not so small that it doesn’t lock the bike
  properly. Lock your bike wherever it is – at home or in the street. When
  locking it at home, make sure the doors and windows are locked and the bike is
  out of sight. Ensure your bike is covered under your home insurance policy. •
