  In Sand Point, Alaska, the radio dial is mostly empty. For a commercial
  broadcaster, running a station in this Aleutian Island fishing town of about
  600 people just is not worth the cost of doing business. But KSDP, the local
  public radio station for Sand Point, is a community anchor, bringing listeners
  music, emergency alerts, live color commentary of high school sports, state
  and local news. Without a newspaper specifically serving the town, the station
  is residents’ resource for all things local. On 1 August, for example, KSDP
  hosted an interview with local fish biologist Matthew Keyes. Asking the
  questions was Austin Roof, general manager of the station. Over fuzzy
  microphones, the two volleyed stats back and forth about the escapement rates
  of “pinks” and “kings” (colloquialisms for two of the most fished species of
  salmon). Roof served as a stand-in for the laborers listening at home or
  aboard their ships, asking about the noticeably low catches early that summer;
  Keyes told listeners that while June was among the lowest harvests on record,
  July had been much better. He then announced the fishing schedule for early
  August: there would be no fishing allowed for 60 hours straight as officials
  monitored fish populations, after that, anglers could tune to the radio daily
  for specific opening and closing times. In a region where livelihoods are tied
  to this turbulent and highly regulated industry, this information gave
  residents a chance to plan their summer of labor. In just the past few summer
  months KSDP has brought listeners not only crucial information about local
  fisheries, but also delivered updates and orders to get to high ground in the
  wake of two tsunamis. All the while, legislators 4,000 miles away in
  Washington DC were solidifying a decision that will fundamentally alter the
  media available to millions of Americans, especially in rural areas: on 17
  July, Congress voted to rescind all funding for public broadcasting. Within
  hours of Roof’s fishery interview, the hammer dropped: the Corporation for
  Public Broadcasting (CPB), through which federal funding is disbursed to
  public radio and television stations, announced it will close down at the end
  of September. The average public radio station in the US gets less than 13% of
  its budget from the federal government. For many coastal and big-city
  stations, it is an even smaller portion. But at smalltown and rural stations,
  where donor bases are less robust, that number can climb above 50%. KSDP,
  which operates a far-reaching AM signal, a web stream and four small FM
  repeater signals placed in villages across a several hundred mile stretch of
  islands, gets 70% of its operating budget from CPB – among the highest shares
  of federal support for any station in the country. “The rural communities are
  definitely gonna be hit the hardest,” Roof says. “How do you prepare for the
  end of the world? The loss of federal funding is truly that seismic for us.”
  Chairs in KSDP’s broadcasting studio and office are stacked high with jackets.
  Shoes overflow from a cardboard box in the small meeting room, and haphazardly
  folded garments fill any unused tables or shelf space. Crammed in Sand Point’s
  city hall, the station doubles as a donation center and hosts clothing swaps a
  few times a year. If you attend a community barbecue in town, a public
  back-to-school party, or holiday celebration, there’s a good chance the radio
  station put it on. Power tools are a permanent fixture in the studio, and
  there is always a neighbor ready to do the simple fixes for free or cheap.
  Roof has personally ascended the station’s 200ft AM tower in climbing gear
  many times to save money on repairs. Until a few years ago, KSDP and the Sand
  Point area did not have a reporter dedicated to their stretch of the Aleutian
  Islands: a remote archipelago extending south and west from mainland Alaska,
  and home to roughly a dozen communities ranging in size from about 20 to a few
  thousand residents. For years, KSDP relied on coverage from the radio station
  KUCB in the larger Aleutian town of Unalaska, nearly 400 miles (644km)
  south-west, as well as statewide and national programs. Now the station
  finally has its own reporter: Theo Greenly, who splits his time between KSDP
  and two other radio stations, KUCB and KUHB, each hundreds of miles apart
  across the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands. Together with his colleagues Sofia
  Stuart-Rasi and Maggie Nelson at KUCB in the larger 4,400-person town of
  Unalaska, Greenly is one of just three journalists covering the 1,000-mile
  archipelago, and the only one assigned to cover Sand Point. Greenly’s
  reporting regularly brings him to isolated communities for weeks at a time, as
  ferries between towns in his coverage area sometimes run only monthly, and
  flights are often delayed or cancelled. “There are many, many places to get
  news from Washington or New York,” says Greenly. “But there are zero
  alternatives for news from this region.” Greenly has covered dangerous sea
  algae blooms, Indigenous language revitalization efforts, and a cargo ship
  carrying lithium batteries that caught on fire in a local port. He was on the
  ground when the Aleutian town of King Cove’s main employer, the Peter Pan
  fishing cannery, closed down, leaving many residents without jobs and many
  anglers unpaid for the hauls they had already delivered. In July, a resident
  of the 400-person town St Paul, located about 400 miles north-west of Sand
  Point, informed Greenly that the town was running out of food; the sole
  grocery store, owned by the local tribal government, had been waiting over a
  month to receive a large shipment of stock that it had paid for, but was stuck
  at the Anchorage airport. Ace Air Cargo had not flown to St Paul in all that
  time, citing weather issues. Not long after Greenly reported the story, the
  company got its cargo planes in the air, delivering more than 10,000lb of food
  and two tons of mail to St Paul. It costs money to report these stories but
  there is not a lot of money to be made in sharing them – especially in the
  far-flung, sparsely populated Aleutian Islands. Commercial radio stations are
  exceedingly rare here; there’s simply not enough listeners. Public media, by
  design, fills the market gap. “Rural America costs a lot of money,” says Roof.
  Alaska is one of the most heavily federally subsidized states in the US in
  terms of public services such as education, internet connection and media.
  Nevertheless, Nick Begich, Alaska’s sole congressperson, voted with all but
  two of his fellow Republicans to take back federal funds that had been
  allocated for broadcasting. Greenly followed debate on the cuts closely. “I
  mean, there is nobody covering this stuff,” he says, noting that he and his
  two colleagues in the Aleutians essentially double as the region’s only
  newspaper reporters, as the paper serving the archipelago runs print versions
  of the public radio pieces alongside stories reported out of Anchorage or by
  national newsrooms. And he says it is not just locals who will suffer if
  public journalism in Alaska takes a hit, mentioning that his colleagues were
  key in covering the 2023 story of the possible Chinese surveillance balloons
  over Alaska. “When Shell was doing exploratory drilling in the Arctic, this
  was their home port. When Chinese and Russian military ships cross into the
  Exclusive Economic Zone, we are the closest reporters,” he says. “If you don’t
  have reporters here, the nation is missing out on vital information.” Roof,
  the general manager, says KSDP has enough to “keep the lights on for a while”.
  And while he doesn’t have imminent plans to close, he knows that losing more
  than two-thirds of the station’s operating budget will fundamentally change
  what they can do. He says they will have to rely increasingly on volunteers
  rather than paid staff if they want to survive. And he can’t imagine how he
  will be able to continue hosting things like big public events. “Those are the
  kinds of things that really make our community a fun place to live,” Roof
  says. “And so I just don’t see that coming back.” Roof is already planning one
  major change due to the cuts: he expects to have to shut down KSDP’s
  far-reaching but costly AM signal by the end of the year. While AM
  listenership may be declining nationwide, it still plays an essential role
  here: AM signals reach much farther than FM, penetrate terrain, and carry
  extraordinarily far – sometimes hundreds of miles – over water, making it easy
  to be heard on distant islands or on ships. Roof is planning to shutter the AM
  signal rather than sell it, as he does not expect to have any interested
  buyers. The tower, he assumes, will be torn down and sold for scrap. For now,
  Roof plans to keep operating KSDP on a handful of very small, localized FM
  signals located in four villages across the Aleutians, and online via web
  stream, since many people in this region have internet connection for the
  first time thanks to new fiber optic lines and satellite systems such as
  Starlink. But not everyone lives in the villages with FM coverage, and the web
  is not always reliable, says Greenly. A ship’s anchor once ripped apart the
  fiber cable bringing internet to the Aleutian Islands. Ultimately, says
  Greenly, cuts to public radio will have an impact on residents regardless of
  how they tune in. “The word ‘radio’ is kind of a misnomer in a way,” he says.
  He tells me that people always ask him if people can’t just get this
  information online. “Yes,” he tells them, “because we, the radio station, did
  the work, investigated it, and put it on the internet.” Without the newsrooms
  and stations supported by CPB, he says, “they can’t get that information.”
  Greenly says he doesn’t know what will happen to his position. His role as the
  shared reporter for KSDP and two other local stations is funded by a grant
  from CPB. But his livelihood, he says, is the least of his concerns. “I’m more
  saddened for the nation than for myself. I’m worried about the community. I’m
  worried about Sand Point,” he says. As for him, the intrepid local reporter
  braving the elements to cover stories from fishing to fracking? He says: “I
  mean, I go back to bartending.”
