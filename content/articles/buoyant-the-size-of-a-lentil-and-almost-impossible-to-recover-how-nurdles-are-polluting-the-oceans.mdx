  When a Liberian-flagged container ship, the MSC Elsa 3, capsized and sank 13
  miles off the coast of Kerala, in India, on 25 May, a state-wide disaster was
  quickly declared. A long oil slick from the 184-metre vessel, which was
  carrying hazardous cargo, was partially tackled by aircraft-borne dispersants,
  while a salvage operation sealed tanks to prevent leaks. But almost three
  months later, a more insidious and persistent environmental catastrophe is
  continuing along the ecologically fragile coast of the Arabian Sea. Among the
  643 containers onboard were 71,500 sacks of tiny plastic pellets known as
  nurdles. By July, only 7,920 were reportedly recovered. Millions of these
  plastic balls have continued to wash ashore with the fierce monsoon storm
  surges that demolished a stretch of palm-fringed beach in Thiruvananthapuram,
  Kerala’s capital, in June. They lie scattered by the sea-facing Catholic
  church at Vettukadu and in tide lines on the beach, where giant jute bags of
  them, gathered by volunteers, await collection. Lightweight, buoyant and
  almost impossible to recover, they will circulate in moving sand and ocean
  currents for years, experts say. “The nurdles haven’t just polluted the sea –
  they’ve disrupted our entire way of life,” says Ajith Shanghumukham, a fish
  worker in the town. A fishing ban, imposed after the spill by local
  authorities in four Kerala districts, has since been lifted but fears over
  contamination have hit fishing communities already struggling with declining
  fish populations and the changing climate’s intensifying storms. “Very few
  people now venture out to sea because the local markets simply aren’t buying
  fish,” says Shanghumukham. Those who do report nets full of nurdles and
  declining catches. “People continue to worry about contamination,”
  Shanghumukham says. While 100,000 fishing families received compensation of
  1,000 rupees (£8.50) from the state, this represented less than a week’s
  income for most. “The crisis has plunged many families into poverty,” he says.
  Nurdles, a colloquial term for the plastic pellets, are the raw material used
  for nearly all plastic products. Lentil-sized, at between 1-5mm, and thus
  potentially classifying as microplastics, or fragments smaller than 5mm, they
  can be devastating to wildlife, especially fish, shrimps and seabirds that
  mistake them for food. They also act as “toxic sponges” attracting so-called
  forever chemicals such as PCBs and PFAs in seawater on to their surfaces, and
  also carry harmful bacteria such as E coli. “When ingested by marine life,
  these pellets introduce a cocktail of toxins directly into the food web,” says
  Joseph Vijayan, an environmental researcher from Thiruvananthapuram. “Toxins
  can accumulate in individual animals and increase in concentration up the food
  chain, ultimately affecting humans who consume seafood.” Microplastics have
  been found in human blood, brains, breast milk, placentas, semen and bone
  marrow. Their full impact on human health is unclear, but they have been
  linked to strokes and heart attacks. The spill’s location and timing could not
  have been worse, Vijayan says. Nearly half of India’s seafish are landed in
  the Malabar upwelling region, where the shipwreck happened. And Kerala’s
  turbulent monsoon season, from June to August, which has hampered clean-up
  operations, is a time of great marine productivity, when rising nutrient-rich
  waters bring blooms of plankton, the foundation of the marine food web.
  Worryingly, following the Keralan spill, there have been reports of nurdles
  once again washing up on beaches in Sri Lanka, a reminder of the worst
  recorded plastic pollution spill in history when the X-Press Pearl container
  ship, carrying chemicals, caught fire and released 1,680 tonnes of nurdles
  into the sea off Colombo in 2021. The Kerala disaster, the latest in a series
  of pellet spills, has again exposed huge gaps in accountability, transparency
  and regulation in the plastics supply chain, environmentalists say. Dharmesh
  Shah, a Kerala-based plastics campaigner at the Centre for International
  Environmental Law, says: “These spills expose the transboundary nature of
  pellet pollution, affecting countries regardless of their role in plastic
  production. “They reveal a chronic lack of enforceable global standards across
  the supply chain – from production to transport – coupled with inadequate
  transparency, reporting and accountability.” Sekhar L Kuriakose, of the Kerala
  State Disaster Management Authority, estimates the clean-up could take up to
  five years. The state has filed a $1.1bn (£820m) compensation claim against
  MSC. The container shipping company MSC, which chartered the vessel, along
  with the owner, have filed a counterclaim, disputing jurisdiction and seeking
  to limit their liability. But the consequences of nurdle spills are being felt
  globally. In March, nurdles washed up on Britain’s Norfolk coast after a
  container ship collided with a tanker in the North Sea. In January 2024,
  millions of pellets washed up on Spain’s Galician coast. Communities can wait
  years for compensation. It took until last month for Sri Lanka’s highest court
  to rule that the X-press Pearl’s Singapore-based owners owed $1bn compensation
  for the 2021 sinking’s “unprecedented devastation to the marine environment”
  and economic harm. At least 445,000 tonnes of nurdles are estimated to enter
  the environment annually worldwide; about 59% are terrestrial spills, with the
  rest at sea. The number of big nurdle spills at sea is increasing, according
  to Fidra, a Scottish environmental charity. With plastic production expected
  to triple to more than 1bn tonnes a year by 2060, along with more frequent and
  intense storms, the threat is expected to grow, with some 2tn nurdles spilling
  into the environment a year. Yet no international agreements exist on how to
  package and transport nurdles safely, or even to classify them as hazardous.
  This week, delegates from more than 170 countries are meeting at the UN’s
  plastic pollution talks in Geneva, in an effort to resolve deep divisions over
  whether plastic production will be included in a final treaty. Campaigners
  hope successful talks will allow a global approach to pellet loss, packaging,
  transportation and legal accountability. Amy Youngman, a lawyer at the
  Environmental Investigation Agency, says: “Because of the biodiversity in the
  area, the Kerala spill is devastating. But coming four years after the X-Pearl
  Xpress, it was foreseeable.” One problem, she says, is that ships are not
  required to disclose they are carrying pellets. Another is the failure to
  recognise harm when spilled. “They are not seen as hazardous or dangerous
  material so they are shipped like any other produce,” she says. Human error
  causes most spills, she says, adding that laws on handling and storing pellets
  could reduce spills by 95%. A research paper published in June co-authored by
  Therese Karlsson, a scientific adviser for the International Pollutants
  Elimination Network, showed that plankton may well have been malformed after
  exposure to leached chemicals from plastic and burnt plastic debris from the
  X-Pearl Express. Of 16,000 chemicals in plastic, 4,000 are known to be
  hazardous. “But for more than 10,000 of them we don’t know the health
  impacts,” she says.
