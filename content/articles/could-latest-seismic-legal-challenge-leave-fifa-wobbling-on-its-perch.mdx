  The tectonic tensions in the world of football produced a seismic tremor this
  week. News emerged from the Netherlands of a class action that promised to
  seek compensation for players whose careers – the case claimed – had been
  blighted by Fifa’s rules. The scale of the action, undertaken by the group
  Justice For Players, is potentially vast: it holds that every active
  professional player, male or female, since 2002 could claim against Fifa for
  about 8% of their career earnings. Coming as a consequence of the ruling by
  the European court of justice (CJEU) on the Lassana Diarra case last year, the
  class action is considered exceptional by many in football because it has the
  potential to hit a governing body hard in the pocket. Should enough players
  and former players join, and were it to be successful, Fifa could be liable
  for a sum in the billions. Whether that materialises is another matter. The
  Guardian has spoken to multiple figures within the game, including those close
  to the JFP action, who regard the likely outcome as one that ends in
  negotiation, with the hope of achieving substantial systemic changes. The
  Diarra judgment found that Fifa rules relating to the authorisation of
  transfers for players restricted freedom of movement, a key tenet of EU law,
  and that rules requiring buying clubs to cover the cost of compensation for a
  player who breaks a contract “without just cause” are anticompetitive. One aim
  for the group, therefore, could be a remedy known as “injunctive relief”,
  whereby a defendant must carry out a certain action, in this case such as
  making a set of agreed changes to the transfer rules, alongside paying
  damages. Among the possible solutions is a stipulation that release fees are
  inserted into all footballers’ contracts, as in Spain, although it would be
  tough to ascertain a universal market value. Another may be that players sign
  shorter deals, for example for two years with an option, rather than the
  standard four-plus-one; that would have the effect of reducing transfer fees
  but could also mean players respond by requesting higher wages. A key actor in
  the class action has been Dupont-Hissel, a Belgian law firm. One of its
  partners, Jean-Louis Dupont, represented Jean-Marc Bosman in the historic 1995
  case and the firm has been a consistent thorn in the authorities’ side, also
  representing the European Super League’s backers in their recent case against
  Uefa, and the Belgian club RFC Seraing in their successful case against Fifa
  and Uefa, where they challenged the court of arbitration for sport’s role in
  the game. Fifa faces other issues. Last year European Leagues and Fifpro, the
  global players’ union, announced they had complained to the European
  Commission over Fifa’s alleged lack of consultation over changes to the
  international match calendar. In a related action, five European player
  unions, including the Professional Footballers’ Association, submitted a claim
  to the Brussels court of commerce asking for the CJEU to intervene. The legal
  route has been increasingly embraced by stakeholders who feel there has been a
  lack of constructive dialogue with the global regulator. Last month the Fifpro
  leadership travelled to New York expecting to meet Gianni Infantino to discuss
  player rest breaks before the final of the Club World Cup, a tournament that
  caused much consternation inside the union. They say they were guided to
  another meeting while Fifa’s president met union leaders unaligned with
  Fifpro. Two weeks later the Fifpro president, Sergio Marchi, criticised what
  he called the “autocracy” of Fifa under Infantino; in response Fifa issued a
  statement accusing Fifpro of “blackmail” and demanding the union publish its
  financial reporting in full. If Fifpro did not do so, the statement said, Fifa
  would “move forward together with players and those who really want the best
  for football”. Fifpro gave tentative backing to the JFP claim this week. The
  number of legal challenges to Fifa is rising, even if there does not appear to
  be a coordinated effort, and there are those within the game who regard it as
  the best opportunity for stakeholders to get the global governing body to
  listen to their concerns. Those with knowledge of the Fifpro legal action say
  it is conceived of in those terms, with the hope that the EU will seek to
  bring parties together to address their dispute. Behind it all lies not only
  an increasing frustration with Infantino’s running of Fifa but a desire for
  reform of the European model of sports governance. Questions raised by the
  CJEU Super League ruling – over whether a regulator such as Fifa can also be a
  competition organiser – have not gone away and are an undercurrent in the
  latest debates. The Justice For Players class action is being led by serious
  figures, meanwhile, with Dupont and JFP recruiting the former Tottenham
  technical director and England assistant manager Franco Baldini to the group’s
  board. Baldini’s connections within the game remain widespread and he has
  form, particularly while with Roma, for taking on the status quo. The question
  is whether this particular challenge is the one that finally sets Fifa
  wobbling on its perch. Fifa has been approached for comment.
