  A man has been arrested in Lancashire after racist and abusive messages were
  sent online to the England defender Jess Carter during the women’s Euros in
  July. The UK football policing unit launched an investigation after receiving
  a report that the messages had been sent on social media. Officers worked in
  partnership with social media companies to identify the people responsible. On
  Thursday, police arrested a 59-year-old man from Great Harwood on suspicion of
  malicious communications in relation to some of the messages. He has been
  released on bail while the investigation continues. Police said the messages
  Carter had been sent were “appalling” and they expected the arrest to be “the
  first of many”. “The messages directed towards Jess Carter were appalling and
  I would like to commend her for standing up to this abuse and assisting with
  our investigation,” said Mark Roberts, the chief constable of Cheshire
  constabulary and the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) lead for football
  policing. “Nobody should be subjected to such disgusting abuse, and I expect
  that today’s arrest will be the first of many over the coming months. We want
  to make it clear that racist abuse of this nature will not be tolerated.
  Everyone is responsible for what they do and say, and we want to ensure
  offenders cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments.” PC
  Dan Fish of Lancashire police said: “Lancashire police does not tolerate hate
  of any form, either in person or online. I hope this arrest sends out a clear
  message that Lancashire police will leave no stone unturned in identifying
  those who engage in such unacceptable behaviour – no matter how long it
  takes.” Carter spoke out last month about racist messages she had received
  while playing in the Euros, which England went on to win.
