  Something is thinning in public space. Pavements are still crowded. Parks
  still bustle. But if you look more closely – or, better still, if you measure
  it – the texture of our interactions has changed. Together with colleagues at
  Yale, Harvard and other universities, we used AI to compare footage of public
  spaces from the 1970s with recent video in the same locations in New York,
  Boston, and Philadelphia. The findings are striking: people walk faster,
  linger less, and are less likely to meet up. That’s no surprise in a world
  where phones, Netflix and AI companions are luring us away from real-world
  spaces and real-world friends. Yet, if technology is part of the problem, it
  may also be part of the solution. By using AI to study urban public spaces, we
  can gather data, pick out patterns and test new designs that could help us
  rethink, for our time, our modern versions of the agora– the market and main
  public gathering place of Athens. The urban playground has always drawn
  curious minds. Among the sharpest was William “Holly” Whyte, who filmed plazas
  and parks in 1970s New York. He was fascinated by where people chose to sit,
  how they navigated space, and what drew them together. His findings,
  documented in The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces (1980), were at times
  beautifully simple: “What attracts people most, it would appear, is other
  people.” From his footage, Whyte turned his observations into data-backed
  recommendations: he said seats should be “two human backsides deep” and sung
  the praises of movable chairs that let people chase sun or shade. His analysis
  helped save New York spaces such as Bryant Park and shaped our modern approach
  to people-centred design. Whyte’s experiments were revelatory, but hard to
  replicate. Why? Analysing the footage, frame by frame, took a team of
  assistants months. Now, finally, that challenge has been overcome, as we have
  invented non-human evaluators. Our team digitised Whyte’s original footage and
  compared it with recent videos – of Bryant Park, the steps of the Met Museum
  in New York, Boston’s Downtown Crossing, and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street –
  collected by sociologist Keith Hampton. Then we trained an AI model to analyse
  the two sets of footage. AI allows self-driving cars to recognise bikes and
  pedestrians; that same technology excels at analysing footage of parks and
  plazas, and keeping track of hundreds of people at the same time. What took
  Whyte months now takes minutes. So how have cities changed between 1970 and
  2010? As we discuss in a recent paper in the proceedings of the National
  Academy of Sciences, walking speeds have increased by 15%. People stand still
  less often. Dyads – pairs meeting and then walking together – have declined.
  Downtown Crossing in Boston, once lively and social, has become a
  pass-through. Even in Manhattan’s Bryant Park – improved, according to Whyte’s
  vision – the number of social interactions has fallen. Cities have not
  emptied, but a part of their essence has thinned. Different forces have caused
  these changes. Work rhythms are accelerating and as time becomes more
  precious, we are less willing to spend it meandering. Perhaps people prefer
  Starbucks to the park. The iPhone was barely three years old in 2010, yet
  already we may have been pulled into our personalised data streams, abandoning
  the wandering gaze of the flâneur. That could be a disaster for our social
  fabric. Online, we drift into curated echo chambers, scrolling past discomfort
  and filtering out dissent. Public space, by contrast, remains gloriously
  unfiltered. It invites friction, messiness, surprise. A rival football fan
  holds the door for you. Your children play with children who speak different
  languages. If we spend less time in public space, we might lose tolerance for
  the wider public – and thus lose the habit of citizenship itself.
  Paradoxically, the same technologies pulling us inward might help bring us
  back out. Social media is addictive because algorithms are constantly testing
  out what we like. If we use AI to analyse outdoor public spaces, we can do the
  next best thing: give every park, plaza and street corner its own, personal
  William Whyte to test improvements there. What types of chairs and benches
  best promote interaction? Could adding greenery or water features create a
  more comfortable microclimate? Which public games might help break the ice?
  Temporary design interventions could be introduced, evaluated with AI, and
  iterated through a process of trial and error – evolving organically, much
  like nature itself. To this end, architects should not shy away from using new
  AI tools, as we argue at this year’s Biennale Architettura in Venice. But how?
  First, with humility. Public spaces of the past were far from perfect – often
  excluding women, minorities, and those with access needs. We should not
  romanticise them. Nor should we surrender to a technology-led present.
  Optimising public life through data alone risks repeating the mistakes of high
  modernism. AI can reveal patterns. It cannot dictate what is good. Second,
  with curiosity. Public space is not static. It is alive. It responds to heat,
  light, geometry, programme. Small interventions – a bench in shade, a water
  fountain on a hot day, a winding path instead of a shortcut – can transform
  behaviour. In a recent study in Milan, we found that compliance with 30km/h
  speed limits had less to do with signage and more to do with street geometry.
  What slows us down is not instruction but design. Climate change, too, plays a
  growing role. As temperatures rise across southern Europe, many urban spaces
  remain shaped by outdated climatic expectations. Sicily can now grow mangoes,
  yet its squares offer little protection from heat. We might learn from cities
  such as Singapore, where the orchestration of vegetation, water, and shading
  are used to actively mitigate heat. If Europe’s climate is changing then its
  public spaces must follow. The deeper challenge is this: for too long,
  designers have worked at a remove – imagining how people should behave from
  studios located far from the street. Today, we have tools to observe how
  people actually behave. To test hypotheses. To prototype joy and proximity.
  Yet these tools must be used not for optimisation but for stewardship. If we
  can use them wisely, we can counter the hollowing of public space. The agora
  isn’t dead. It just needs redesigning. And if we’re smart about it, AI might
  just help us get there. It may help us hear something else too: the fragile,
  elusive symphony of the commons. Carlo Ratti is professor at MIT and
  Politecnico di Milano, and director of Venice’s 2025 Biennale Architettura
