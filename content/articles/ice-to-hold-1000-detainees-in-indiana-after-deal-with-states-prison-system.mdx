  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) is expanding its detention
  capacity by 1,000 beds in Indiana through a partnership with the midwest
  state’s prison system, federal officials announced on Tuesday. Ice will be
  housing detainees at the Miami correctional center, a prison run by the
  Indiana department of corrections. The move is part of the US government’s
  rapid expansion of immigration jails after Donald Trump’s sweeping spending
  bill allotted roughly $170bn to Ice, an extraordinary sum making the agency
  the most heavily funded law enforcement department within the federal
  government. Kristi Noem, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, said
  the Indiana facility would be called the “Speedway Slammer”, following last
  month’s opening of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail in
  Florida, in collaboration with Ron DeSantis, the state’s Republican governor.
  Noem claimed Tuesday that the Indiana prison would house “some of the worst of
  the worst” of undocumented people, echoing DHS’s repeated claims about the
  targets of its enforcement. But records from the jail in the remote Florida
  Everglades, which critics have called a concentration camp, cast doubts on
  those assertions. Reporting from the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times last
  month found more than 250 people detained at the jail who have no criminal
  convictions or pending charges in the US, despite state and federal officials
  saying the jail was for “vicious” and “deranged psychopaths” facing
  deportation. Those newspapers also recently reported that a 15-year-old boy
  with no criminal record was sent to the jail, which is not supposed to house
  youths – a mistake the jail claimed was due to the boy “misrepresenting” his
  age. Florida advocates have alleged that the conditions at the Everglades jail
  were appalling, with detainees forced to sleep in overcrowded pods where
  sewage backups led to cages flooded with feces. While officials have denied
  claims of inhumane treatment, the Trump administration has also promoted the
  brutality of the facility, including with the widely criticized decision to
  name the jail “Alligator Alcatraz, a reference to the remote location in a
  wetland surrounded by crocodiles, alligators, pythons and mosquitoes. DHS
  appears to be using a similar tactic with the “Speedway Slammer” name in
  Indiana, which Noem promoted with a social media post, saying: “If you are in
  America illegally, you could find yourself in Indiana’s Speedway Slammer.
  Avoid arrest and self deport now.” DHS did not immediately respond to
  questions about the timeline of the Indiana expansion and how the facility
  would be run. The Miami correctional facility is a maximum-security prison at
  a former air force base, roughly 70 miles north of Indianapolis, and has
  capacity for around 3,100 people, according to the IndyStar newspaper. The
  Florida jail is run by that state’s division of emergency management, an
  arrangement that has raised alarm among advocates, as journalists found many
  detainees were housed in the facility even though they were not listed in
  Ice’s database. Mike Braun, Indiana’s governor, said in a statement the state
  was “taking a comprehensive and collaborative approach to combating illegal
  immigration” and was “proud to work with President Trump and Secretary Noem as
  they remove the worst of the worst”. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
  in Indiana has previously raised alarms about Miami correctional center
  conditions. In cases filed in 2021, the ACLU said some incarcerated people in
  segregated housing were forced to live in prolonged darkness, in cells with
  live electrical wires hanging from fixtures that in some cases shocked the
  residents. “We wouldn’t tolerate animals being held in such horrifying
  conditions, how can we tolerate them for people?” the ACLU said in 2021.
  Corrections officials declined to comment at the time. Annie Goeller, a
  spokesperson for the Indiana department of correction (IDOC), did not respond
  to questions about conditions on Tuesday, but said in an email her department
  was working with the governor to “partner with federal authorities to enforce
  immigration laws”, adding: “Details about the partnership and how IDOC can
  best support those efforts are being determined.” The Indiana move comes as
  the Trump administration has increasingly sent immigration detainees to
  federal prisons that house criminal defendants. Those partnerships have
  reportedly caused chaos behind bars, with immigrants and their lawyers
  reporting horrific conditions and overcrowding, exacerbating problems for the
  long-term residents serving sentences. Also on Tuesday, the Associated Press
  reported that the DeSantis administration in Florida is planning to build a
  second immigration detention center. Noem has said the Everglades jail in
  Florida would be a model for state-run immigration detention centers. And DHS
  has said that Trump’s bill will provide funding for 80,000 new beds for Ice.
