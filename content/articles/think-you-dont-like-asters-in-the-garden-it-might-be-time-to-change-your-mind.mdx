  Think you don’t like asters in the garden? It might be time to change your
  mind

  One of the things that makes gardening so perpetually, addictively interesting
  to me is how it challenges beliefs I’d previously held about myself – often on
  an annual basis. Some beliefs are big, others are smaller, such as my dislike
  of asters. Ask me in the middle of spring, when everything is new and fresh,
  and the tulip petals look as if they’ve been streaked with a fan-shaped brush,
  and I will confidently say I’m not an aster fan. Too fussy, too much lilac,
  too bushy. But scoot forward six months, and I regret I hadn’t planted a few
  in the gaps that appear at this time of year. For the uninitiated, asters –
  also known as Michaelmas daisies because they are often in flower in late
  September – are a large group of several species of shrubby daisies. They are
  unfussy to grow, will put up with part shade or full sun, and aren’t
  particularly needy, as long as they’re not subjected to drought or boggy
  conditions. In short, there’s probably somewhere in your growing space that
  could accommodate one where there isn’t anything else growing for the next few
  months. I’ve been prompted to think about asters because we’ve just moved into
  a house with a blank slate of a back garden, and the promise of a good, dry
  garden out the front. The number of ornamental plants growing across both
  could be counted on one hand, and the bog-standard pale purple (a colour that
  always reminds me of Tammy Girl circa 1998, iykyk) aster is among them. If
  you’re starting a garden from scratch, with not much money, addressing whether
  you can accept what’s currently happy there is a fair basis for a contented
  relationship. I’m beginning to think I will welcome them not only into the
  front garden, but also into the back, where my dreams of Piet Oudolf-style
  clouds of dew-dropped asters will shiver into future autumns. Oudolf – the
  Dutch garden designer whose clumps of naturalistic planting have inspired more
  contemporary gardens than most – deployed A. umbellatus in the Oudolf Field at
  Hauser &amp; Wirth art centre in Bruton, Somerset. It’s white, which makes it
  a great palette-cleanser for the bolder, warmer tones of late-summer and
  autumn planting, and pleasingly tall. I’m also eyeing up A. pyrenaeus
  ‘Lutetia’, a favourite of Beth Chatto’s, which has large, spidery flowers in
  the palest lilac. If you wanted something more keenly purple, check out
  Symphyotrichum novi-belgii ‘Violetta’, which is real wizard’s-robe territory.
  Some will flower long into the autumn, and then offer up graceful skeletons
  for catching frost. In spring, cut them back, remind yourself you once said
  you didn’t like asters, and be grateful you’ve changed your ways.
