  People in the US: have you been affected by interest resuming on student loan
  debt under the Save plan?

bodyText: >-
  Under the Biden administration, about 8 million people enrolled in a 2023
  income-driven repayment plan for student debt – the Saving on a Valuable
  Education (Save) plan. But as of 1 August, the Trump administration has
  resumed charging loan interest under the Save plan to borrowers, who have been
  in forbearance since last year. The Department of Education has recommended
  people switch to another repayment plan for their federal student loans.
  Borrowers can still forgo payments, but will see interest accruing on their
  loans and won’t make any progress toward student loan forgiveness. We want to
  hear from you. Are you a US borrower who enrolled in the Save plan? What do
  you plan to do now that interest is again being charged? Will you be forced to
  make changes to your spending habits in order to make new payments? How will
  this affect you? If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read
