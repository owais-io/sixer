  Ozzy Osbourne, the Black Sabbath frontman and a defining figure of British
  heavy metal, died of cardiac arrest and also suffered from coronary artery
  disease and Parkinson’s disease, according to a death certificate filed by his
  daughter and obtained by the Sun and the New York Times on Tuesday. The death
  certificate, which was reportedly filed at a registry in London by Aimée
  Osbourne, one of Ozzy Osbourne’s daughters, reportedly lists the official
  cause of death as “(a) Out of hospital cardiac arrest (b) Acute myocardial
  infarction (c) Coronary artery disease and Parkinson’s disease with autonomic
  dysfunction (Joint Causes)”. Osbourne died on 22 July at the age of 76. In a
  statement confirming his death, the Osbourne family said: “It is with more
  sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved
  Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and
  surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this
  time.” His funeral was held on 30 July in his home city of Birmingham,
  England. As the hearse carrying Osbourne made its way through the city centre
  to his private funeral, thousands of fans lined the streets to honor him and
  pay their respects. Osbourne’s wife Sharon, along with their children Aimée,
  Kelly and Jack, joined mourners for the emotional tribute. Osbourne’s death
  came just weeks after his final performance. On 5 July, Osbourne reunited with
  his original Black Sabbath bandmates for the first time in nearly two decades
  at a farewell concert. In recent years, Osbourne faced numerous health
  challenges. A fall in 2019 worsened a prior spinal injury and required
  multiple surgeries. In 2020, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with a
  form of Parkinson’s disease in 2019. In an interview with Good Morning America
  in 2020 after announcing the diagnosis, Osbourne said: “It’s been terribly
  challenging for us all.” He added: “I did my last show New Year’s Eve at The
  Forum. Then I had a bad fall. I had to have surgery on my neck, which screwed
  all my nerves.”
