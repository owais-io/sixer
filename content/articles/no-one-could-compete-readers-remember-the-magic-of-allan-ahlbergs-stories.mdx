  Burglar Bill ‘I worked with kids who struggled – this one boy would listen
  with rapture’ Thirty years ago I was a healthcare assistant working for CAMHS
  in a major city. It was a brilliant creative job where I worked with primary
  school kids who were struggling with home and school life. We had one little
  boy, aged seven, who was a world of chaos, he found it hard to connect with
  others and he had a tough exterior on show nearly all the time. However, a
  couple of times a week, we had story time in the library, a quiet and tiny
  room, and he would always, without fail, come and sit as close to me as he
  could, and ask very quietly for “Bogalabol” – Burglar Bill. He would then
  listen with rapture and delight to the whole story, and join in with his
  favourite phrases. As he listened, he became a little boy again, taking
  pleasure in this story with its salt of the earth burglars, and the simple joy
  of being read to. It remains one of my favourite memories of that time. Of
  course I read Burglar Bill to my own kids, and I expect I’ll read it to any
  grandchildren I have! Tanya Logan, 53, Frome, Somerset ‘I used to do my best
  Ray Winstone growl when reading’ I loved Burglar Bill. He steals such bonkers
  stuff, and then he finds – a baby! And eventually true love with Burglar
  Betty. I used to read it to my kids doing Burglar Bill in my best Ray Winstone
  growl. They loved it. The books were a great way to introduce my own kids to
  reading, and later many others when I worked as an English teacher. Esther
  Pocock, librarian, Sweden The Happy Families books ‘I still use the letter he
  wrote to me to this day’ I’m a primary school teacher and about 12 years ago I
  wrote to Allan Ahlberg with my class. He took care to write a really
  individual letter back to us, addressing every child’s comments (and mine),
  and he also shared some early drafts of Mrs Wobble the Waitress and some
  copies of a couple of his new books at the time (Hooray for Bread was one of
  them). I was really impressed by his generous spirit in replying in such
  detail, and I still use the letter with classes to this day to say: “Look,
  real authors need to re-draft, so you should too!” Luke Stratton, 41, primary
  school teacher, Coalville, Leicestershire Each Peach Pear Plum ‘On a whim, I
  texted my 28-year-old daughter the first line and she replied with the next
  one – and so it went on for 10 minutes’ All of them are favourites – but
  particularly Each Peach Pear Plum and The Jolly Postman books. On a whim I
  texted the first line of the former to my 28-year-old daughter the other day.
  She immediately texted back (while at work I may add) the following line from
  the book, and so it went on for 10 glorious minutes between us both, word
  perfect with no cheating, smiling away at our phones. Me – charmed at the way
  this book has resonated through the years between mother and daughter. She –
  thrilled with a young child’s delight in being clever in remembering it all in
  the middle of her busy day. It is still the book I buy for all new parents I
  come across, as I will do for hers as and when she has children of her own.
  Jayne Stead, retired teacher, York ‘My two girls love it’ The wonder of the
  Ahlbergs’ books span generations and they are so detailed, clever and don’t
  talk down to children. [Allan’s wife Janet Ahlberg illustrated all his books
  until her death in 1994.] They are among the few authors I enjoy reading night
  after night; I received Each Peach Pear Plum from a friend with older
  children, who wistfully said she could still happily recite it from memory. My
  two girls love the book. Caroline Haywood, 39, lawyer, Nairobi, Kenya Peepo!
  ‘My child who was non-verbal until three could still communicate by finding
  items in the pictures’ With my own child, who was non-verbal until three,
  books with things to look for such as Peepo! meant they could still
  communicate by finding items in the pictures. The repetitive nature also meant
  things could be mimed or signed. Then when speech came the rhymes were fun and
  they were reading without noticing! Allan Ahlberg’s books enriched my teaching
  and the lives of children I know. Isn’t that a special legacy? Kathie, former
  teacher now works in data protection, St Helens Cops and Robbers ‘No one could
  compete with the Ahlbergs’ There are so many to choose from but I’d have to
  opt for Cops and Robbers as it went from mild peril to slapstick comedy and
  had everything in between. I loved them when I was a kid and when my daughter
  was little I read her every Janet and Allan Ahlberg book I could get my hands
  on. We read a lot of books together but no one could compete with the
  Ahlbergs. They are the greatest children’s authors of all time, bar none.
  Martin Hall, 46, librarian, Frankfurt, Germany The Baby’s Catalogue ‘It helped
  me as a new parent’ The Baby’s Catalogue was introduced to me by an unemployed
  mother while waiting in a Berkeley unemployment line 40 years ago. Two
  children later, while waiting in a pediatrician’s office I discovered a ratty
  copy of Burglar Bill on the book pile. The story was so enchanting that I am
  ashamed to say I nicked it. The Baby Catalogue helped me as a new parent
  understand that the smallest, mundane parts of a child’s day could be
  beautiful and important to them so to accept it with patience and grace. As
  for Burglar Bill, my boys didn’t turn to a life of crime like their mother. In
  my defence I’ve taken good care of the book. Kathy Nilsson, 67, retired,
  Mountain View, California Funny Bones ‘To open his books is to feel a jolt of
  warmth and home again’ I had all but forgotten about Ahlberg’s books until I
  started working as a children’s bookseller. To discover them again, to turn
  the pages 20 years on from the last time, made me ache for a time and a place
  long gone. That feeling never leaves me. Peepo! and Each Peach Pear Plum both
  sit on my son’s bookshelves and even though I see the spines every single day,
  to open them is to feel that jolt of warmth and home again. They are
  perfection. Funny Bones has now become one of my son’s favourite books. People
  complain it’s too long, but how can you not relish getting to linger over
  those “dark, dark” lines? Hannah Renowden, 42, page planner, Glasgow
