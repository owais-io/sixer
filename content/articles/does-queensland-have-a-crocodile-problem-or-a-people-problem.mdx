  “We from the country have had enough.” So ends the submission of Kelvin
  Douglas John Bunyan to a Queensland parliamentary committee considering
  legislation that would allow for safari-style hunting and the harvesting of
  eggs of the most fearsome apex predator of the tropical north: the saltwater
  crocodile. The 177 submissions lodged in response to Katter’s Australian
  party’s crocodile control and conservation bill 2025 are penned by the kind of
  rich and colourful cast for which the far north is renowned. And, like the
  country itself, they are submissions full of surprise and contradiction. There
  is the bowhunter, spearfisher, ex-professional fighter and diesel trucks
  driver who writes with passion and erudition that the proposed crocodile cull
  is “incredibly naive”, unscientific and dangerous – and then there is the
  general practitioner and standup paddle boarder who believes crocodiles need
  to be “kept in their place” so that young people can get off their phones and
  back into the fresh waterways. There is the Carpentaria Land Council
  Aboriginal Corporation, which supports the bill “overall” – though with the
  important caveats that Indigenous people play a more integral role in croc
  management and that the species’ conservation be given greater emphasis. Then
  there is the Kunggandji cultural custodian to whom Kunjurra Kunggandji – or
  the saltwater crocodile in his language – is a totem, a spiritual guide and an
  ancestor, and for whom the killing of this sacred animal is the killing of
  kin. Sign up: AU Breaking News email There are the tour guides who say they
  would be embarrassed to tell international visitors they lived in a state that
  slaughtered wild crocs and that removing salties would hurt their businesses.
  Then the charter boat operators and fishing guides who fear for their
  industries should the bill not pass. There is the houseboat resident who says
  she nearly lost her husband to a lunging croc a week after it took her dog.
  And the Daintree forest dwellers who say their swampy retreat is healthier
  with crocodiles in it. There is Bunyan, born in 1961, who grew up on a farm in
  the Innisfail region and who writes – almost entirely unburdened by
  punctuation – with echoes of the wild poetry of the Jerilderie Letter, that
  handwritten manifesto of the legendary bushranger Ned Kelly. “At those times
  there was no crocodiles however eventually after 10 or so years we suspected
  that they’re crocodiles and sure enough on New Year’s Day in about 1983
  several young children on the side of the river we’re going down for a swim
  when a crocodile took their pet dog my father warned me that at some point
  that would be the case making one of the children but fortunately Oh well
  unfortunately for the dog he was the victim in that case … ” And there is the
  University of Queensland’s crocodile expert, Prof Craig E Franklin. A global
  authority on Crocodylus porosus, Franklin is the scientific lead for the
  world’s largest and longest active tracking program of crocodiles, which is
  carried out in collaboration with Australia Zoo on the saltwater crocs of far
  north Queensland. Franklin recommended the bill be rejected outright,
  describing it as “foolish, misguided and dangerous”. In the end, it was by the
  likes of Franklin that the parliamentary committee tasked with reading through
  these submissions – and attending several public hearings as well as
  travelling through croc country – was swayed when it handed down its
  recommendations on the crocodile bill in late July. The health, environment
  and innovation committee recommended the bill not be passed and was, Franklin
  says, “quite damning” of the proposal. The Gold Coast-based Liberal National
  party chair, Rob Molhoek, began his foreword to the report by noting more
  Australians are “injured or killed by everyday incidents like accidental
  falls, choking, drowning or homicide than by crocodiles”. In 2023 one
  Australian was killed by a crocodile, compared with six people by dogs, while
  accidental falling accounted for 4,105 deaths, choking 1,427 and drowning 204,
  he wrote. Molhoek cited Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service’s croc expert,
  Simon Booth, who argued that even if crocodiles could be removed from the
  state’s waterways, the stealthy ambush predators would still migrate in from
  afar. And the International Union on the Conservation of Nature’s Crocodile
  Committee co-chair Charlie Manolis, who asserted, with more than a hint of
  sarcasm, that making waterways safe in Queensland was “simple”. “You have to
  make crocodiles extinct entirely – remove every single one of them – and then
  put a fence up between the Northern Territory and Queensland, to stop them
  swimming across, put up another fence between Papua New Guinea and us to stop
  them coming down, and then you will be able to guarantee safety,” Manolis
  wrote. Finally, Molhoek signed off with a nod to those who said that crocodile
  attacks were often a result of people engaging in risky behaviour – and that
  the key to avoiding human fatalities was to encourage “crocwise” behaviour.
  “Throughout this inquiry, many submitters told the committee that
  fundamentally Queensland does not have a crocodile problem; Queensland has a
  people problem,” he wrote. For the man who tabled the bill, KAP’s Shane Knuth,
  the “people problem” line adds insult to injury. “That is the biggest woke,
  insulting statement that I’ve ever come across since I’ve been in the
  parliament, 21 years,” he tells Guardian Australia. Knuth says his bill –
  which also called for the creation of a Queensland Crocodile Authority based
  in Cairns and the creation of “zero-tolerance” crocodile zones – would help
  take the fresh waterways of the north back to the “good old days” of the “70s,
  80s, 90s and even early 2000s” when swimming the creeks and waterholes carried
  an “acceptable risk”. He cites the example of the Tully River in his
  electorate of Hill, south of Cairns. “That river, 20 years ago, was full of
  families camped on the sands, kids snorkelling,” he said. “Now it is
  completely taken over by crocs.” Knuth rejects the evidence submitted by
  scientists which showed crocodile numbers were stable or still gradually
  recovering from being hunted to near local extinction. “Just tell ’em to come
  swim across the North Johnstone River or the Tully,” he says. “That’s the true
  science of whether there is an explosion in croc numbers or it’s an illusion.”
  The LNP defector from Tully laments that there were no north Queenslanders on
  the parliamentary committee, and that they “wouldn’t have a clue of the
  reality of what’s going on here in the north”. Brisbane-based Franklin
  bristles at that criticism, which he says is frequently directed at him. “I’ve
  spent well and truly more than a year of my life living under canvas in north
  Queensland catching crocodiles – and I do that safely,” he says. “It is easy
  to live alongside crocodiles. It is just following common sense and some
  simple rules.” The crocodile researcher left Brisbane on Friday for a month of
  crocodile field work on the Wenlock River north of Weipa. Knuth’s bill will
  probably be debated in parliament in coming weeks. If, as the parliamentary
  committee recommends, it is rejected, Knuth promises it won’t be the last word
  on a croc cull. This is the fifth similar bill he has tabled since 2017. “I
  will keep tabling and putting in bills until north Queensland is heard and
  action is taken.”
