  Law enforcement agencies have urged people living in coastal communities in
  the UK to help them catch drug gangs that are using ever more imaginative
  methods to get vast quantities of cocaine into Britain. They have warned that
  gangs are favouring a method called “at-sea drop-offs” (Asdos) in which
  packages of drugs are released into the ocean from “mother ships” for smaller
  vessels to pick up and take into the UK via small coves and harbours. But
  there is also growing concern the gangs may begin to use more sophisticated
  techniques such as deploying underwater drones, nicknamed narco submarines, to
  evade Border Force cutters. The appeal and warnings come as members of a gang
  involved in an attempt to smuggle £18m of cocaine into the UK using the Asdo
  method were sentenced at Truro crown court in Cornwall for conspiracy to
  import class A drugs. The gang included a Hampshire fisher who had fallen on
  hard times, three Essex men believed to have been aiming to sell the drugs in
  the south-east of England, and a Colombian man thought to have been acting as
  security for the South American drug cartel. Three of the men were caught
  after their boat was chased for almost 30 miles by Border Force officers,
  while the other four were arrested after an investigation by the National
  Crime Agency (NCA) into the wider network. Charlie Eastaugh, the director of
  Border Force maritime command, said Asdos appeared to be the preferred method
  of drug smugglers. “It’s a persistent and continuing threat,” he said. Last
  year, law enforcement agencies in the UK prevented almost 6.5 tonnes of
  cocaine, with a street value of £520m, from reaching the streets via Asdos.
  But much more is clearly getting in. It is estimated that people in England,
  Wales and Scotland consume 117 tonnes of cocaine a year. Eastaugh said Border
  Force maritime had more than two dozen vessels patrolling, ranging from
  cutters to rigid-hull inflatable boats and jetskis, and worked with police
  forces as well as military special forces. “We have crews out for up to two
  weeks at one time patrolling around UK territorial waters,” he said. But the
  jagged nature of the coastline in south-west England means there are myriad
  spots for smugglers to land undetected. Eastaugh said good relations were
  being created between agencies and coastal communities through an initiative
  called Project Kraken. “Coastal communities and the maritime commercial
  industry are really key parties in the fight against organised criminality at
  sea and smuggling. They can help contribute by being the eyes and ears of
  Border Force Maritime around the UK coastline.” He said the drug importers
  would innovate. “We would expect, as we would with any type of criminality,
  that the wheel will turn and there will be a threat from other modes in the
  future. “Something we have seen elsewhere in the world is underwater remotely
  piloted smuggling attempts - essentially subsea drones. It continues, as with
  every threat, to be plausible. A more modernised version of smuggling is
  something we’re on the lookout for.” Adam Thompson, the head of drugs threat
  at the NCA, said the Asdos tended to take place in the south-west approaches
  off Cornwall but had also been observed in the Irish Sea and North Sea. “They
  throw them into the sea wrapped up in waterproof packaging and buoyancy aids.
  And then a smaller vessel will come out and fish those out and take them to
  land. That’s the methodology that we’re seeing used most frequently over the
  last two years.” He said changes to the way borders are managed during Covid
  and after Brexit may have prompted the rise of Asdos. “We’ve seen a trend for
  larger loads being put on to these vessels in South America. This is a very
  good way to offload very significant loads – tonnes at a time typically. You
  can throw it into the sea, bring it into a little beach. You don’t even need a
  marina.” Thompson said 34 people involved in Asdos had been arrested last year
  and more than 60 investigations into the method had taken place. He said:
  “We’ve got very good partnerships with Border Force and with maritime agencies
  around the world. This method relies on container ships coming over from South
  America on commercial routes. “We look to understand which ones may have been
  contaminated with cocaine and focus on those routes which we know are being
  used.” Sentencing four of the men, Judge James Adkin said: “This was an
  international conspiracy to smuggle a large quantity of cocaine into the UK.”
  Scott Johnston, 38, of Havant in Hampshire was jailed for 24 years; Michael
  May, 47, of Brentwood, Essex for 19 years; Terry Willis, 44, of Chelmsford,
  Essex for 21 years; and Edwin Yahir Tabora Baca, 33, of Barcelona for 17 years
  and seven months. Three others – Bobbie Pearce, 29, of Brentwood in Essex;
  Alex Fowlie, 35, of Chichester in West Sussex; and Peter Williams, 44, of
  Havant in Hampshire – are to be sentenced later this month.
