  Children in Florida will no longer be required to receive vaccines against
  preventable diseases including measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio and
  hepatitis, said Joseph Ladapo, the state’s surgeon general, on Wednesday in a
  speech during which he likened vaccine mandates to “slavery”. Ladapo,
  hand-picked for the role by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, is a
  long-time skeptic of the benefit of vaccines, and has previously been accused
  of peddling “scientific nonsense” by public health advocates. In his
  announcement on Wednesday, at a press conference in Tampa hosted by DeSantis,
  he said that every state vaccine requirement would be repealed, and that he
  expected the move would receive the blessing “of God”. “Every last one of them
  is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” said Ladapo, who altered data in
  a 2022 study about Covid-19 vaccines in an attempt to exaggerate the risk to
  young men who received one. “People have a right to make their own decisions.
  Who am I, as a government or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in
  your body? Our body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because
  of your relationship with your body and your God.” Ladapo condemned lockdowns
  and vaccination requirements during the coronavirus pandemic as a time “when
  crazy things did happen”, and said that growing skepticism of vaccines were
  “reflections of God’s light against the darkness of tyranny and oppression”.
  Formerly affiliated with the controversial ultra-conservative America’s
  Frontline Doctors group, Ladapo has long railed against Covid-19 vaccines. In
  2023, he urged Florida residents to ignore public health advice and reject
  mRNA booster shots that he falsely claimed had not been tested on humans.
  Several of his other positions on public health issues, such as promoting the
  removal of fluoride from drinking water and urging parents to reject measles
  vaccines for their children, have been called “dangerous” and a “disservice to
  Florida residents”. His “slavery” comment, made with DeSantis at his side, was
  notable. The governor drew allegations of racism in 2023 when the state
  introduced a new education curriculum teaching that the “full truth” of
  America’s history with slavery is that it was beneficial to those enslaved.
  Florida’s department of health currently has strict requirements for
  immunizations that must be given during childhood, which are posted to its
  website. No child can be enrolled in a Florida public school unless they have
  received a series of shots against a number of diseases. Routine childhood
  vaccinations will have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness,
  32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13m deaths among children born in the US
  between 1994 and 2023, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention (CDC) report published last year. It estimated that the vaccine
  program nationally resulted in direct savings of $540bn and societal savings
  of $2.7tn. Ladapo gave no details or timeline for the proposed repeal, but
  said his department would work with lawmakers and the DeSantis administration
  to make it happen. “I love our lawmakers. They’re going to have to make
  decisions … People are going to have to make a decision,” he said. “People are
  going to have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that the moral
  side is so simple.” Ladapo also said that “it’ll be wonderful for Florida to
  be the first state to do it”. Florida’s plan drew praise from Robert W Malone,
  a conservative physician and prominent anti-vaxxer appointed by the US health
  secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to his new advisory committee on immunization
  practices that replaced the independent panel he fired. “Go Joe!” Malone said
  in a post to X, shortly after another tweet in which he said he spoke to
  Ladapo on Tuesday and called him “a measured scientist – who is on fire to
  change the system for the better”. Others were not so convinced. Anna
  Eskamani, a Democratic Florida state representative, called the move “a public
  health disaster in the making”. “Ending vaccine mandates is reckless and
  dangerous. It will drive down immunization rates and open the door to
  outbreaks of preventable diseases, putting children, seniors and vulnerable
  Floridians at risk,” she said in a statement. David Jolly, a former Republican
  congressman for Florida who is running as a Democrat to succeed DeSantis as
  governor when he is termed out in 2027, posted to X that he believed Ladapo’s
  tenure could be limited. “The next Governor gets to fire this guy. I know I
  would. Hopefully Byron Donalds or Paul Renner would do the same,” he wrote,
  referring to two high-profile Florida Republicans who have announced their
  candidacies. “Since the 1980s, all states had school vaccines mandates. If
  Florida abolishes [its mandate], it would be the first in recent times to do
  so,” said Dorit Reiss, professor of law at the University of California
  College of the Law, San Francisco, who specializes in vaccines law and policy.
  But she pointed out that there doesn’t seem to be a law introduced yet, which
  is a big if. She noted that Idaho attempted to end school mandates in April,
  but ended up carving out exceptions for existing mandates – effectively
  rendering that part of the law moot – after pushback from advocates. “I would
  also add that one reason all states adopted them is that evidence showed
  school mandates reduce and prevent outbreaks. If Florida does this, it’s
  creating an unfortunate natural experiment with its children as guinea pigs,”
  Reiss said. “Children deserve better.” The Florida department of health did
  not immediately respond to a request for comment. Melody Schreiber contributed
