  Awdah Hathaleen, the prominent Palestinian activist who was killed late last
  month by an extremist Jewish settler in the West Bank, filmed the moment he
  was shot, newly released video footage reveals. Hathaleen, who worked on the
  filming of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, which examined settler
  violence against the Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta, was killed by
  Yinon Levi, a settler who was already under sanctions in the UK and EU for
  violent acts against Palestinians. The footage – released by the Israeli human
  rights group B’Tselem – appears to offer clear evidence of Levi’s direct
  involvement in the killing of Hathaleen, an English teacher and activist
  resident in Umm al-Khair in the south Hebron hills, on 28 July, in an incident
  that sparked international outrage. Levi was arrested over the killing but
  quickly released by a court after a ruling that the evidence he had fired at
  Hathaleen had “weakened”. Levi has denied he fired the shot that killed
  Hathaleen. However, the footage filmed by Hathaleen himself shows Levi draw
  his weapon and fire in Hathaleen’s direction. Hathaleen is then heard groaning
  and falling to the ground. Hathaleen was filming settlers operating an earth
  mover when he was shot. According to witnesses, a confrontation that was
  taking place between Levi and Palestinian residents became more heated when
  the digger attempted to approach a fenced-off grove belonging to a Palestinian
  family, with at least one stone thrown. The footage, filmed from some distance
  away, shows Levi waving a gun and scuffling with residents as they attempt to
  block the earth mover. Levi can then be seen taking several steps to his right
  before raising his gun, aiming it in Hathaleen’s direction, and firing. The
  footage sharply contradicts claims by Levi’s lawyer, Avichai Hajbi, that he
  had been “forced to fire his weapon into the air” because he felt his life was
  in danger. Hathaleen’s footage is backed up by witness evidence provided to
  B’Tselem, including by his brother-in-law Alaa Hathaleen, who was present at
  the time of the killing and is seen in the footage remonstrating with Levi at
  close quarters and attempting to film the events himself with his phone. “The
  settler Yinon Levi arrived,” Alaa Hathaleen told B’Tselem. “The residents
  shouted at him, and he drew his gun. I tried to film him pulling out the gun,
  but he attacked me and grabbed my phone. “Suddenly, while we were trying to
  move people away and the excavator was already on the road leading to the
  settlement, Yinon Levi fired one shot, and then another shot. “I heard shouts:
  ‘Awdah! Awdah!’ I turned around and found my cousin Awdah lying in the public
  garden of Umm al-Khair’s community centre. He was bleeding heavily from the
  chest and mouth. It turned out he had been shot while filming the events, from
  about 40 meters away, behind a metal fence we had put up around the garden.”
  Levi was sanctioned by the UK in 2024, along with others, because he “used
  physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property
  as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian
  communities”. Levi’s treatment by the courts since the shooting is in line
  with a long history of lenient treatment by both the Israeli civilian and
  military courts of Israelis who kill Palestinians.
