  Every now and then, a bit of nostalgia bait drifts across my social media
  feed, with people pining for the brighter colors of the past – the vivid hues
  of the Toys R Us logo, or a 90s McDonald’s play zone. On Reddit, posters
  observe: “As I get older it feels like life is losing its color,” and ask:
  “Were colors brighter and more vibrant when I was younger?” Indeed, according
  to research from the UK’s Science Museum Group, there’s been a stark increase
  in gray everyday objects since the mid-20th century. But this dullification
  may go beyond the modern preponderance of ashen cars, sad beige nurseries and
  millennial gray apartments. Scientists believe that color perception itself
  can fade, altering how the world appears. Depending on how your eyes – and
  brain – age, the bright red balloon you remember from your seventh birthday
  party might not look as vivid if you came across it again at 93. Changes in
  color perception can occur for several reasons. One common factor is
  structural shifts in the eye. For instance, a cataract – a condition that
  clouds the eye’s lens – can gradually tint vision with a yellow-brown
  “brunescent” hue. In the US, about 4m cataract surgeries are performed
  annually. A brunescent lens “can pull the blue and green out” of the world
  around us, says Dr Andrew Iwach of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
  After a cataract is removed, the difference in color clarity afterward can be
  so striking that Iwach wears a bright blue tie to delight his recovering
  patients. Changes in color perception can also be caused by glaucoma or
  macular degeneration. Iwach recommends routine eye exams, and says if you
  notice this type of change, see an ophthalmologist. Research from 2024 found
  that up to 15% of global dementia cases could be linked to problems with color
  perception issues, meaning that an eye exam can be an important step in
  screening and mitigating the disease. Some medications can also affect color
  perception, says Iwach – namely Viagra (pilots are required to abstain from
  the drug eight hours before flying lest it affect their perception of blue
  hues) and some types of heart and tuberculosis medications. Yet research
  suggests that even in the absence of eye disease or medication use, color
  perception can shift over the course of our lives. Dr Janneke van Leeuwen, a
  social neuroscientist and honorary research fellow at University College
  London’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, noticed a subtle trend in
  behavioral studies from the last three decades: older adults consistently
  rated colors duller than younger participants did. Van Leeuwen set out to
  investigate: do we truly see the world differently as we age? And if so, is it
  the eyes or the brain driving that change? Her 2023 study involved 17 young
  adults and 20 older adults in “an eye tracking experiment” featuring 26
  colors, which varied in lightness (how light or dark a color appears) and
  saturation (how pure and intense a color appears). Using a camera that
  recorded pupil diameter 1,000 times per second, Van Leeuwen’s team observed
  how participants’ pupils reacted to each color. They found a reduction in the
  way older people’s pupils responded to more highly saturated colors, even when
  correcting for the shrunken baseline pupil sizes that come with age. Thus, it
  seems some older adults may genuinely perceive the world as less colorful. Van
  Leeuwen recalls one participant saying: “Oh, it’s a shame there’s not a real
  punchy red.” “I was thinking: ‘Well, you’re looking at one!’” she says. The
  issue, Van Leeuwen explains, “doesn’t necessarily originate in the eyes, but
  in the brain”. Pupil responses are controlled by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus,
  a midbrain structure that receives input from the retina and the visual
  cortex. This means that pupillary reactions reflect both what the eyes detect
  and how the brain processes that information. The brain becomes less sensitive
  to how saturated and vivid colors are not because the eyes fail to register
  them, says Van Leeuwen, but because the visual cortex may no longer interpret
  them with the same intensity. “Older adults seem to be particularly less
  sensitive to the intensity of colors on the magenta-green pathway,” she adds,
  referring to the anatomical structures in the eye that help process colors.
  More research is needed to understand why, but the cause probably lies in how
  the cones in our eyes interact with color-processing pathways in the brain.
  Currently, Van Leeuwen is following up her study with an investigation into
  how differences in saturation perception influence the way colors make younger
  and older adults feel. The 2023 study’s findings align with a phenomenon
  called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect: the brain’s tendency to perceive
  highly saturated colors as brighter than less saturated ones, even if their
  actual lightness is the same. Believed to be an evolutionary trait for
  important evaluations such as the ripeness of fruit, this effect also takes
  place in the primary visual cortex. This “further supports our findings that
  the decline in sensitivity in color saturation in healthy ageing originates in
  the brain, and not the eyes”, says Van Leeuwen. There is no sign this loss of
  saturation perception follows the same process as the onset of certain types
  of dementia, Van Leeuwen emphasizes – many older adults experience vision
  declines without developing dementia, which has multiple risk factors.
  However, the study does provide insight into how our brains change as a result
  of normal, healthy ageing, which is useful context in the study of
  neurological disease. Is there anything you can do to stop age-related
  declines in saturation perception? Researchers don’t currently believe that
  lifestyle habits can meaningfully influence this process. But there’s some
  evidence that the brain can be “trained” to see the world differently. Anya
  Hurlbert, a color and vision scientist at Newcastle University, points to a
  2020 study involving EnChroma glasses, which feature a saturation-boosting
  tint to help reduce the effects of some types of color blindness. Participants
  with red-green color perception deficiencies who wore the glasses reported
  seeing increased color saturation even after removing them. Alternatively,
  simply surrounding oneself with more intense colors could help. As Van Leeuwen
  notes, “Older adults tend to evaluate more saturated colors more positively
  than younger adults … which seems to suggest they might need the extra
  stimulation.” Just another reason to see the new Wes Anderson movie.
