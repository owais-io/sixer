  Donald Trump has said he believes Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal on
  the war in Ukraine as the two leaders prepare for their summit in Alaska on
  Friday, but his suggestion that the Russian leader and Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  could “divvy things up” may alarm some in Kyiv. The US president, who left the
  White House on Friday at 7.30am, implied there was a 75% chance of the Alaska
  meeting succeeding, and that the threat of economic sanctions may have made
  Putin more willing to seek an end to the war. “HIGH STAKES!!!” he posted on
  Truth Social as his motorcade idled outside the White House shortly after
  sunrise in Washington. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he would not let
  Putin get the better of him in the meeting, saying: “I am president, and he’s
  not going to mess around with me. “I’ll know within the first two minutes,
  three minutes, four minutes or five minutes … whether or not we’re going to
  have a good meeting or a bad meeting. And if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end
  very quickly, and if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace
  in the pretty near future.” Trump also said a second meeting – not yet
  confirmed – between him, Putin and Zelenskyy would be the more decisive. “The
  second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that’s going to be
  a meeting where they make a deal. And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’
  things up, but you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term, OK?” Trump
  told Fox News Radio. He was referring to the possibility that Zelenskyy will
  have to accept “land swaps” – the handing over of Ukrainian territory to
  Russia, potentially including some not captured by Moscow. Later on Thursday,
  Trump suggested that any second, trilateral meeting could happen quickly – and
  possibly take place in Alaska. “Tomorrow, all I want to do is set the table
  for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” he said. “I’d like to see
  it actually happen, maybe in Alaska.” Any such meeting would be a concession
  by Putin since he refuses to recognise Zelenskyy as the legitimate leader of
  Ukraine. Trump conceded he was unsure whether an immediate ceasefire could be
  achieved, but expressed interest in brokering a peace agreement. On Putin, he
  said: “I believe now, he’s convinced that he’s going to make a deal. I think
  he’s going to, and we’re going to find out.” Zelenskyy will face a difficult
  choice if Putin rejects Ukraine’s call for a full 30-day ceasefire and offers
  only a partial break in the fighting, particularly if Trump thinks a three-way
  meeting should still go ahead. The Ukrainian president spent much of Thursday
  in London discussing Wednesday’s video call between European leaders and Trump
  with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. European leaders were largely
  relieved with the way the conversation went, but know Trump is unpredictable
  and prone to acting on instinct, rather than sticking to a script. The US
  secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said changes on the battlefield could make
  peace harder. “To achieve a peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have
  to be some conversation about security guarantees,” he said. Trump has
  rejected offering such guarantees before, but it is possible European security
  guarantees could be agreed. Rubio said he believed Trump had spoken by phone
  to Putin four times and “felt it was important to now speak to him in person
  and look him in the eye and figure out what was possible and what isn’t”.
  Starmer and Zelenskyy met in Downing Street for breakfast on Thursday and
  hailed “a visible chance for peace” as long as Putin proved he was serious
  about ending the war. European leaders emerged from Wednesday’s meeting
  reassured that Trump was going into his summit focused on extracting Putin’s
  commitment to a durable ceasefire and was not seeking to negotiate over
  Ukraine’s head. The plan for Trump and Putin to hold a joint press conference
  after their talks suggests the White House is optimistic the summit will bring
  about a breakthrough. Moscow is determined that the summit should not just
  focus on Ukraine but also agree steps to restart US-Russian economic
  cooperation. In a brief summary of the Downing Street meeting, British
  officials said Zelenskyy and Starmer expressed cautious optimism about a truce
  “as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious” about peace. In a
  separate statement, Zelenskyy said there had been discussions about the
  security guarantees required to make any deal “truly durable if the United
  States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killing”. On Wednesday Starmer
  co-chaired a virtual meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – a
  European-led effort to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine to enforce any
  deal – where he said there was a “viable” chance of a truce. On Thursday the
  prime minister gave Zelenskyy a bear hug in the street outside the door to No
  10 in a symbol of continuing British solidarity with the Ukrainian cause.
  Similar public displays of solidarity followed the disastrous February meeting
  between Trump and Zelenskyy, when the two leaders quarrelled in front of the
  cameras in the White House. Further sanctions could be imposed on Russia
  should the Kremlin fail to engage, and Starmer said the UK was already working
  on its next package of measures targeting Moscow. Trump has frequently said he
  will know if he can achieve peace in Ukraine only by meeting Putin personally.
  He sets great faith in his personal relationship with the Russian leader, but
  on Wednesday he played down expectations of what he could do to persuade Putin
  to relent. At the same time he warned there would be “very severe
  consequences” for Russia if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, a veiled
  threat to increase US sanctions on Russian oil exports. He has so far held off
  from imposing such economic pressure on Russia, but by the end of the month
  the US is due to impose additional tariffs on Indian imports into the US as a
  punishment for India continuing to buy Russian oil. The UK would like to see
  the US consider other, more targeted sanctions, either on the shadow fleet of
  Russian oil tankers or on refineries that use Russian oil. But Moscow briefed
  that the Alaska summit, far from leading to extra economic pressure on the
  Russian economy, would instead include discussion and agreements on new
  US-Russian economic cooperation, a step that would relieve the pressure on
  Russian state finances. Some European leaders took heart from the detailed
  grasp of the issues shown on the call by the US vice-president, JD Vance, and
  by hints that Trump could be willing to contribute US assets to a European-led
  security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement. The Alaska
  summit, due to start at 11.30am local time (2030 BST), will include a
  one-to-one meeting between Trump and Putin, with interpreters, then a wider
  meeting. The Russian delegation will include the foreign minister, Sergei
  Lavrov; the defence minister, Andrei Belousov; the finance minister, Anton
  Siluanov; the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev; and
  Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov.
