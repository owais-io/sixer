  Manchester United’s plans to build a 100,000-seat stadium next to Old Trafford
  are facing delays due to a standoff over the price of land needed to begin
  work on the construction of the proposed ground Sir Jim Ratcliffe has called
  “the Wembley of the North”. The club want land used as a rail freight terminal
  to complete the Old Trafford Regeneration Project, which they claim will bring
  £7.3bn a year to the UK economy. United have held talks with Freightliner, the
  haulage company that owns and operates the terminal, about buying the land,
  but negotiations are deadlocked due to a disagreement over the price. While
  Freightliner is understood to have expressed a willingness to relocate from
  Trafford Park to nearby St Helens, the company is seeking around £400m for the
  land, with United valuing it at between £40m and £50m. Ratcliffe has made it
  clear United are unwilling to accept the asking price set by Freightliner’s
  parent company, Brookfield, and initial discussions are believed to have
  reached an impasse. A source said Freightliner “have United over a barrel”.
  The company is willing to relocate to a proposed new site that would offer
  increased capacity for trains, but it is in no rush to move. The club’s view
  is that Freightliner will only receive what would be a significant windfall if
  they are willing to drop the asking price. When unveiling designs for the Old
  Trafford master plan, produced by Foster + Partners, in March, Ratcliffe set
  an ambitious target of completing what he described as a five-year build by
  2030. United had been hoping to begin preparatory building work by the end of
  this year, but failing to secure the Freightliner site will delay the start
  date. United’s options at this stage would be to increase their offer, wait
  for Freightliner to lower its demands, or scale back the project so that the
  freight terminal land is not required. It is also possible the new Old
  Trafford Mayoral Development Corporation, chaired by Sebastian Coe, could
  issue a compulsory purchase order, although that would be subject to legal
  challenges and would lead to further delays. Completion by 2030 was always
  seen as an ambitious target outside the senior leadership team at Old
  Trafford, given United have yet to obtain planning permission, secure
  ownership of all the land required or formally appoint architects. While
  Foster + Partners produced the artist impressions and videos of the proposed
  new stadium, the club plan to run a formal tender process to appoint
  architects. At a Fans Forum event on 30 June, United conceded that securing
  the land required could prove an obstacle to beginning work this year. United
  were asked by supporters whether building would commence in 2025 or 2026 and
  responded: “Planning work is continuing, including the consultations with fans
  discussed during today’s meeting. “Discussions are also ongoing with local
  authorities, land owners and potential funding partners with a view to
  securing the land and the finance we need to proceed with the project. It
  remains our ambition to proceed with the project as quickly as possible, but
  we can only do this once the necessary land and funding is in place.” United
  have estimated the cost of the project at £4.2bn, but claim it will bring huge
  social and economic benefits to the local community and wider region,
  including 92,000 jobs, more than 17,000 new homes as well as attracting an
  extra 1.8 million visitors annually. The cost for the stadium has been
  projected by United to be around £2bn, although given the tented roof alone is
  likely to cost £300m, industry sources say £3bn is a more realistic budget.
  Freightliner’s demands for £400m could result in the redevelopment being
  significantly over budget from the start. United are not seeking any public
  money to build the stadium itself. The club declined to comment on a private
  commercial negotiation.
