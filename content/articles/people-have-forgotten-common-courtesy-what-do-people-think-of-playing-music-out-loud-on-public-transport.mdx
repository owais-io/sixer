  ‘People have forgotten common courtesy’: what do people think of playing music
  out loud on public transport?

  A campaign by Transport for London (TfL) to target people playing music or
  videos out loud on public transport is launching this week, with posters
  targeting “headphone dodgers” appearing on the Elizabeth line and other
  services from autumn. TfL bylaws already ban passengers from singing or
  playing music out loud anywhere on the network unless they have a licence such
  as the ones granted to approved buskers. For some, the campaign is overdue,
  while for others, questions on how it will be enforced have been raised.
  ‘Since the pandemic, people have forgotten common courtesy’ I think this is
  long overdue. Particularly since the pandemic, lots of people seem to have
  forgotten how to behave with common courtesy in public. I’ve started pulling
  people up on this kind of behaviour and it’s really satisfying, to be honest.
  However, I think the other issue is a structural one: our public services,
  particularly transport (outside London, anyway) are massively degraded. Asking
  people to respect public spaces, if it’s going to work, needs to be a two-way
  street: you show everyone around your respect by keeping your devices quiet,
  but we (the state) show you, the public, respect in return, by investing in
  public transport that people feel comfortable on and proud of as a national
  asset. That’s the only way to solve this problem permanently. Tom, 33,
  lecturer, Leeds ‘I’m autistic and even noise-cancelling headphones are not
  perfect’ It absolutely needs to happen. I’m autistic and the constant
  bombardment of noise really upsets me. I’ve bought expensive noise-cancelling
  headphones that cost £299 and they’re still not perfect. One person on a tram
  was blasting out music so loudly behind me that it overpowered my headphones.
  When I politely asked him to turn it down, he said I should just put my
  headphones back on. Only when he became threatening did the tram conductor get
  involved. I don’t know what “asking people to be considerate” is going to do.
  The people that are doing it know they’re being inconsiderate and don’t care.
  Michael, 35, trade union official, Sheffield ‘No one seems willing to pay for
  trained people’ It would be a good thing, but it seems odd that TfL did not
  predict that the provision of internet access on the underground would
  inevitably lead to what people are complaining about now. It was common on
  buses long ago. Of course there is far too much unnecessary noise, but it has
  been tolerated and even encouraged for so long that I doubt it can be dealt
  with effectively now. No one seems willing to pay for the number of trained
  people (police and others) it would take to civilise the UK. Chris, 61,
  paralegal, London ‘Suck it up and get over it’ Has the country really come to
  the stage where everything is so perfect that we don’t have anything else to
  be worried about? There’s often antisocial behaviour on public transport, but
  are we going to police everyone’s behaviour? I can’t stand the smell of people
  eating or those who smell of tobacco. What are you going to do? You suck it up
  and get over it. When the tube has all its escalators working, every station
  is step-free, the air con is working when you need to and there are safe,
  clean toilets at every station, then get back to me. Stephanie, 58, career
  coach, London ‘TfL should look to itself before it preaches about noise
  pollution’ I agree that the use of headphones should be encouraged, but that
  isn’t the only source of noise pollution on London transport. TfL plays far
  too many unnecessary announcements: “Hold the handrail”, “Don’t run when the
  floor is wet”, “Stand behind the yellow lines”, and the list goes on. Each
  announcement taken individually is not unreasonable, but collectively is an
  incessant barrage of noise pollution. I’ve bought noise-cancelling headphones
  just to wear on the underground, and that isn’t because of the people who play
  music or have phone conversations. TfL should look to itself before it starts
  preaching to others about noise pollution. John, 68, retired, London ‘For
  those with hearing issues, loud sounds create a stressful environment’ I live
  with one-sided hearing loss, so all sounds I hear are via my one working ear.
  For people like me, multiple voices overlap and combine into a meaningless
  jumbled cacophony. A person in a confined area speaking loudly on their phone,
  or playing media without headphones, is not just distracting and irritating
  for everyone affected. For those with hearing issues, they create an extremely
  unpleasant and stressful environment. When those of us who struggle are trying
  to get somewhere, we feel trapped, and that really is horrible. Shell, 48,
  singer, Cardiff ‘Feels like a pointless waste of resources’ As much as I hate
  music being played out loud on public transport, it’s usually just an
  individual on their own, so I find it incredibly annoying and selfish. How
  could this possibly be clamped down on? Feels like a pointless waste of
  resources to put these posters up when there will never be staff members to
  enforce the rule. Jane, 33, research scientist, London ‘It’s encouraging but
  needs to be firmer’ I think addressing sound pollution on TfL is long overdue.
  I enjoy taking public transport because it’s an “in-between” space, of sorts.
  We’re constantly stimulated by sounds and images, so the train feels like one
  of the only quiet spaces left. While it’s encouraging to see this campaign, it
  is too soft and needs to be firmer. Signs suggesting that we would rather
  audio isn’t played out loud won’t work, because people are so absorbed in
  their phones to look up and actually see the sign. Paradoxically, I don’t mind
  when people get on the night tube with a boom box or play music on the way to
  the Notting Hill carnival. That’s a whole vibe and a bit of London flair. It’s
  somehow different, because it encourages a sense of participation. Remy, 30,
  humanitarian worker, London • This article was amended on 27 August 2025 to
  change the image to one that better reflected the editorial content.
