  Summer seems to end earlier every year – the weather turns, the football
  starts, and you realise you’re going to spend the remainder of August trying
  to reconnect with your lost luggage. This year the traditional demarcation
  between the seasons – when we arrive home from holiday to find everything in
  our house in dire need of immediate repair – has come so early that we haven’t
  even been away yet. The light switch in the downstairs loo is stuck in the on
  position. The back door will not shut. The garden hose has exploded. “Nothing
  in this house works,” my wife says, trying to flick the jammed light switch.
  “Better always on than always off,” I say, trying to be positive. A stuck
  light switch is no reason to cancel your holiday, after all. It has been a
  bright, warm summer morning, but now the sky suddenly darkens. A steady rain
  starts to fall. I begin the long process of trying to close the garden door:
  yanking it shut while lifting the handle – repeatedly – until it finally
  catches. After a few moments the rain turns heavy, battering the skylight
  above. “I was gonna buy a new hose today,” I say. “I guess there’s no hurry.”
  “We needed the rain, I suppose,” my wife says, staring out the window as the
  back garden blurs. “That’s the spirit,” I say. The oldest one appears, down
  from the attic bedroom where he now lives and works. “The roof is leaking,” he
  says. “I need something to catch the water.” “Take a bowl,” my wife says. “I
  put a bowl there already,” he says. “But the bowl is full. I need a bucket.”
  We find a bucket and follow him upstairs. A crack has appeared in the bedroom
  ceiling – several cracks, in fact, forming a jagged asterisk with water
  pouring steadily from its centre. “That’s new,” I say. In the distance I hear
  the ominous roll of thunder. I think: this actually is the kind of thing
  people cancel holidays for. By the time the bucket is full the rain has
  stopped and the sun is out. Normally I would take this opportunity to put the
  problem out of my mind, but I was struck by the speed at which the water
  cascaded from the crack. It wasn’t like a leaking roof. It was like not having
  a roof at all. Later, on my way to bed, I find a wet spot on the lower
  bannister, which I trace to a second leak – water raining down two floors from
  the very top of the staircase. I decide not to tell anyone about this. “Did
  you call Mark?” I ask my wife the next day. I am referring to Mark the
  builder, who my wife sometimes calls “Mark No Problem” in order to contrast
  his approach to life and work with mine. “Yes,” she says. “I told him it was
  fairly urgent.” “Did he say ‘no problem’?” “He didn’t, actually,” she says.
  “He said the roofer he usually recommends has just retired.” “Oh,” I say. “But
  he’s going to try to find someone else,” she says. The next day my wife texts
  me a phone number to call. It’s from Mark, but it’s a recommendation once
  removed: he’s heard good things. The man at the other end of the phone seems
  mildly suspicious of me, an unrecommended customer. But he says he will try to
  stop by and look at my leak before Thursday. “I’m going on holiday on
  Thursday,” he says. I text him my details. The person who calls me on Tuesday
  is not the man I called originally. He’s the man’s nephew, he says, and also a
  roofer. He can come on Wednesday. “Is there easy access to the roof?” he says.
  “No,” I say. The nephew arrives the next morning. I take him through the house
  to the garden, so I can point at the bit of roof in question. “It’s the flat
  bit right at the top,” I say. “Above the window.” “It’s just a question of how
  we get everything up there,” he says. I take him up to see the star-shaped
  crack in the ceiling, with the bucket still underneath. “That’s not good, is
  it?” he says. “No,” I say. “Let me get out there and have a look,” he says,
  climbing out the window. He stands on the apex of the rear extension, on his
  toes. I can only see his legs from where I’m standing, by the bucket. “Oh
  that’s bad,” he says. “What?” I say. He pulls his phone from his pocket and
  starts taking pictures. “That’s really bad,” he says.
