  Bad men problem: Gareth Ward and Mark Latham leave NSW parliament in uncharted
  territory

  The New South Wales parliament has a problem with men behaving badly. But more
  to the point, it seems to have an inability to deal with it. On Tuesday, the
  parliament will try to deal with two very different cases that share a common
  consequence: damage to its reputation as an institution. Gareth Ward Despite
  being a convicted rapist in custody awaiting sentence, Gareth Ward, the MP for
  Kiama, remains a member of the Legislative Assembly, drawing a base salary of
  more than $170,000 courtesy of NSW taxpayers. Labor plans to move a motion to
  have him expelled when parliament resumes on Tuesday and the opposition has
  said it will support it. Expelling Ward will almost certainly lead to more
  litigation, especially as the government will probably try to call a
  byelection in his south coast seat soon after. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  But first to backtrack a little. Most politicians being investigated or facing
  criminal charges choose to resign, or their parties put the pressure on the MP
  to draw a line under their faltering political career. But Ward has toughed it
  out and continues to claim his innocence, despite being convicted for serious
  sex offences against two young men. He was suspended and left the Liberal
  party in 2022 after being charged with sex offences. He then ran as an
  independent in the 2023 state election and was returned by the voters of
  Kiama. Now that he has been convicted, he faces a potential sentence of more
  than five years. Under section 13A of the NSW constitution, a person is
  ineligible to be an MP if they are convicted of an offence punishable by five
  years or more. But it’s only counted as a conviction once the person has
  reached the end of the appeals process and has not had their conviction
  overturned, constitutional expert Prof Anne Twomey says – and Ward has
  confirmed he plans to appeal against the verdict. The appeals process could
  take years. The other route is expulsion. The NSW constitution does not give a
  specific power to expel a member, but Twomey says there is an inherent power
  for the NSW parliament to expel an MP to protect itself and its proper
  functioning. This appears to be where the premier, Chris Minns, is headed –
  but it is relatively untested territory. The courts have ruled that expulsion
  must not be as punishment, but it can be done to protect public confidence in
  the integrity of the parliament. If Ward is expelled, a byelection would need
  to be held to replace him, which only adds to the complications. Would Ward
  seek an injunction to prevent the byelection while he appeals the expulsion
  and the criminal conviction? Understandably, there are few cases to guide the
  way – the last time an MP was expelled from the NSW lower house was in 1917.
  But what is certain is that unless Ward resigns voluntarily, litigation
  appears inevitable. The first stop will be the supreme court, followed by a
  possible high court appeal. For those who want a deeper dive, Twomey’s
  podcast, Constititional Clarion, explores all the twists and turns that could
  emerge over coming weeks. Mark Latham The controversial independent upper
  house member Mark Latham is also under the microscope but for entirely
  different reasons. The former One Nation MP is under scrutiny over his use of
  privilege within the chamber and his general standard of behaviour, which
  Labor has been calling out of late. Has the Minns government suddenly found a
  new moral rectitude? Or is the premier motivated by more base political
  considerations? Latham has been working with the opposition and crossbench to
  block changes to workers compensation legislation that the government dearly
  wants passed. In parliament, Minns has called him “one of the most shameful
  bigots in NSW” who has an “odious Twitter account”, which he deployed for a
  “disgusting homophobic attack” on independent MP Alex Greenwich. More recently
  prurient allegations about Latham’s personal life have spilled into the public
  domain due to a relationship breakdown, which have added fuel to the fire of
  outrage. These are the subject of a case seeking a domestic violence order
  that he is vehemently contesting. As the relationship degenerated, allegations
  from court filings including leaked texts about female MPs and other unsavoury
  exchanges have found their way into the public domain. Latham’s behaviour
  raises questions of respect for the parliament and female MPs, and whether the
  behaviour is appropriate in any workplace. Latham allegedly covertly
  photographed female workmates and shared the images with derogatory
  commentary. If true, in any other workplace, that would at the least prompt
  counselling, a warning or possibly dismissal. Then there is Latham’s use of
  parliamentary privilege. Privilege exists to allow politicians to speak freely
  without fear of defamation, but Latham arguably pushes its limits. He is a
  blunt, borderline-rude interrogator of witnesses before committees. In the
  chamber he has used privilege to attack his enemies, such as Greenwich, who
  won a $140,000 defamation settlement against Latham in 2024, and domestic
  violence campaigner Rosie Batty. Last month Latham outraged colleagues by
  talking about Greenwich’s medical records, which had been produced as part of
  a separate case Greenwich has brought against Latham in the NSW civil and
  administrative tribunal. But can the upper house actually mete out a
  punishment or persuade Latham to alter his behaviour? The answer is probably
  no. Labor plans to move two motions in the next sitting period, which starts
  on Tuesday: one relating to a specific breach of privilege and another more
  general censure. Labor will allege that Latham breached privilege in relation
  to certain documents about the former police commissioner Karen Webb and
  investigations into gifts of gin that were produced on the basis that only
  parliamentarians could view them. Labor wants Latham referred to the
  privileges committee for breaching the order, something he disputes. The
  allegations of exposing medical records, taking covert photos and perhaps
  other actions are likely to be wrapped up into a censure motion condemning his
  behaviour. But as for meaningful outcomes, don’t hold your breath. The
  privileges committee could recommend an apology or perhaps a suspension, but
  that is rare. Labor lost control of this powerful committee a month ago after
  a dispute with the crossbench and the opposition. They combined to cut a Labor
  member so control of the now seven-member committee is out of Labor’s hands.
  And what of a censure? It is likely to be little more than a slap on the wrist
  for Latham, while he enjoys the notoriety and attention that this latest saga
  will bring. The problem for the NSW parliament is that its rules to set and
  enforce appropriate standards of behaviour are hopelessly outdated, its
  processes are archaic and it has failed to implement many of the
  recommendations from a report by Liz Broderick completed two years ago. The
  federal parliament has moved to establish a standards commission with real
  teeth to fine or even suspend parliamentarians for poor behaviour outside the
  chamber. It is still to be tested but it is a start. Instead, in NSW, we will
  spend weeks on the immediate crises that will further lower the parliament’s
  standing in the public eye, without dealing with the real problem of cultural
  change that is sorely needed.
