  Labour-run councils are considering legal challenges to stop hotels from
  housing asylum seekers after a landmark ruling prompted officials to consider
  increasing the use of former military sites as emergency accommodation. Wirral
  and Tamworth councils said they are exploring high court injunctions to remove
  claimants after the Conservative-run authority in Epping Forest won a
  temporary high court injunction to remove people from the Bell Hotel. The
  developments come after the Home Office minister, Dan Jarvis, said the
  government is looking at alternative options if there is a flurry of
  successful challenges from councils. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is
  determined to stick to her plan after the Epping ruling and its consequences,
  a source said. “We have a plan and we’re sticking to it to close asylum hotels
  by the end of the parliament. This is one narrow court judgment that happened
  yesterday. We’re not being knocked off course, this is our manifesto
  commitment,” the source said. Ministers are reluctant to disclose the details
  about alternatives to asylum hotels because of concerns that it could be used
  as a recruitment tool for the far right, a government source said. Cllr Paula
  Basnett, the leader of Wirral council whose boundaries include the Wallasey
  constituency of the immigration minister Angela Eagle, said the council is
  actively considering “all options” to close a local hotel. She added: “Like
  many other local authorities, we have concerns about the Home Office’s
  practice of placing asylum seekers in hotels without consultation or regard to
  local planning requirements. “We are actively considering all options
  available to us to ensure that any use of hotels or other premises in Wirral
  is lawful and does not ride roughshod over planning regulations or the wishes
  of our communities. “Wirral has always been proud of its record in supporting
  families and those fleeing conflict, but it is unacceptable for the government
  to impose unsuitable, short-term arrangements that disrupt communities and
  bypass local decision-making. “If necessary, we will not hesitate to challenge
  such decisions in order to protect both residents and those seeking refuge.”
  Labour councillor Carol Dean, leader of Tamworth borough council, said the
  council had explored similar legal avenues in 2022 when the Home Office first
  started using a local hotel, but did not end up pursuing them. “The situation
  at Epping Forest represents a potentially important legal precedent, and we
  are carefully assessing what this might mean for our circumstances here in
  Tamworth. “We fully recognise the UK government has a statutory duty to
  accommodate people seeking asylum. However, we have consistently maintained
  that the prolonged use of hotel accommodation may not represent the best
  approach,” she added. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has written to all
  Conservative council leaders encouraging them to launch legal action to close
  hotels housing people claiming asylum. “In the case of Epping, this challenge
  was brought under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. I am encouraging
  Conservative council leaders to take the same steps if your legal advice
  supports it,” she said. Conservative-run Broxbourne council in Hertfordshire
  has said it was taking legal advice “as a matter of urgency”, while Tory-run
  East Lindsey district council in Lincolnshire said officers are investigating
  and “will take appropriate action”. West Northamptonshire council and
  Staffordshire county council, which are led by Reform UK, also said the
  authorities would look at the options available after the high court ruling.
  On Tuesday, Reform UK leaders Nigel Farage and Richard Tice indicated that
  councils run by the party will consider their own legal challenges. However, a
  number of these do not have responsibility for planning permission, which may
  limit their ability to launch legal bids. Other authorities have ruled out
  legal action, with the leader of Labour-run Newcastle city council saying she
  was “confident” the council could end the use of hotels without going to
  court. Karen Kilgour said: “We recognise that people seeking asylum include
  families, women, and children, many of whom have faced unimaginable trauma.
  “Newcastle has a proud history of offering sanctuary, and we stand ready to
  play our part – but it must be done in a way that works for our city and
  supports the dignity and wellbeing of those who come here.” Mr Justice Eyre
  granted the Epping injunction after hearing the local council’s complaints
  that planning law had been breached in changing the site’s use. Epping
  district council also cited disruption caused by the protests and concerns for
  the safety of the asylum seekers themselves. The hotel has been at the centre
  of violent far-right protests since an asylum seeker was charged with sexually
  assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu has denied charges
  against him and is due to stand trial later this month. Since 2020, there has
  been greater reliance on hotels to house asylum seekers, with 32,345 being
  housed temporarily in England and Wales at the end of March this year. Labour
  has promised to end the use of hotels by 2029 by cutting small boat crossings
  and building new accommodation. Asked on Times Radio about possible housing
  options for anyone removed from hotels, Jarvis said on Wednesday that the
  government is “looking at a range of different contingency options”. These are
  understood to include placing people removed from hotels in Wethersfield air
  base in Essex and Napier Barracks in Kent, the two most high-profile disused
  military bases used to house refugees. Figures from the end of March show that
  almost a third of asylum seekers that receive government support were housed
  in “contingency accommodation” – flats and houses. The statistics, from the
  National Audit Office and other official sources, says this amounts to about
  32, 300 people, a reduction of 42% compared with its 2023 peak. Despite
  ministers coming under heavy criticism for the conditions refugees have been
  forced to endure, this Labour government is set to expand the use of both
  bases. It comes after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, pledged to stop using
  taxpayer-funded hotels by 2029 in her Spending Review, in a drive to save
  £1bn. The Home Office aims to achieve this by moving refugees into cheaper
  sites. In April of last year, Cooper said Wethersfield is neither “a
  sustainable solution” nor provides “value for money for the taxpayer”. But an
  internal Home Office memo dated 24 July, seen by the Guardian, shows there are
  plans to put people in Wethersfield despite it being at maximum capacity. It
  states: “While the site’s regular cap is 800 an additional 445 bed spaces may
  be used temporarily during peak demand. There are no plans to exceed 1,245.”
  In March, the high court found the previous government’s use of Wethersfield
  to be unlawful after three men likened their conditions to a prison. Napier
  Barracks, which was due to be handed back to the Ministry of Defence in
  September, will instead continue to house migrants into 2026.
