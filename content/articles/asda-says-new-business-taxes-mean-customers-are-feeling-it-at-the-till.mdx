  New business taxes mean “the consumer is feeling it” as companies pass on
  their costs to shoppers, according to the boss of Asda. However, Allan
  Leighton said the supermarket chain was investing to keep a lid on prices and
  attract cash-strapped shoppers. The UK’s third largest supermarket chain,
  which is at risk of being overtaken by the discounter Aldi, said sales fell by
  0.2% to £5.3bn in the three months to 30 June. The decline was less steep than
  in the prior quarter after the retailer made a “material investment” in
  keeping prices down. An 8.6% rise in sales at Asda Express convenience stores
  and a 2.5% rise in George fashion sales helped to boost the numbers. Leighton,
  who returned to Asda as executive chair last year to help turn around the
  company 20 years after he first rescued it, told the Guardian: “A lot of taxes
  are hitting down on businesses and that’s flowing through to the consumer and
  the consumer is feeling it.” Retailers face a £7bn increase in costs this
  year, according to the British Retail Consortium, after changes were
  introduced in April to employers’ national insurance contributions, packaging
  levies and the legal minimum wage. “To a degree that’s unhelpful,” Leighton
  said, with weak consumer confidence making life harder for retailers as taxes
  and commodity price rises continue to drive inflation. But he said pressure on
  disposable income also “puts us in a good position” given Asda’s historic
  reputation for value, which he is trying to revive. Leighton said he still
  expected a “material reduction in profit” at the business this year as it
  intended to invest what he has called “a pretty significant war chest” in
  keeping prices down and putting more staff on the shop floor. The company said
  on Thursday it had cut prices by an average of 22% on more than half its
  products, with price rises in its stores “significantly lower”. It said
  product availability was now at the highest in eight years. Leighton said his
  turnaround job was on track and that while the task was not harder than he had
  expected, “it is hard as the business underperformed for a long period of
  time”. The company said the sales improvement in the last quarter may not be
  maintained over the summer because of “temporary disruption with product
  availability” in stores and disruption to its “online experience” caused by
  teething problems with the rollout of new IT systems. Asda, which runs more
  than 580 supermarkets, nearly 500 convenience stores and 769 petrol
  forecourts, said it had this week completed a revamp of IT systems to end its
  reliance on technology provided by its former parent Walmart. The project,
  which had been planned to be completed by the end of 2024, is thought to have
  cost close to £1bn, £200m more than initially hoped. Leighton said he still
  expected to end the year with sales in growth but he reiterated a forecast
  that it could take three to five years to revive Asda’s fortunes. The retailer
  has been struggling since a £6.8bn buyout by the Blackburn billionaires the
  Issa brothers and the private equity firm TDR Capital in 2021. TDR now
  controls the business after buying out one brother, Zuber, while the other,
  Mohsin, stepped back from in effect running the retailer last year but retains
  a 22.5% stake. Asda’s parent group slumped to a near £600m loss last year as
  sales at the supermarket group fell and the cost of servicing its debt pile
  increased. Sales at established stores slid by 3.4%. Asda said it would resume
  opening new Express convenience stores in early October with a new site in
  Castleford, West Yorkshire. Up to 20 further convenience sites are scheduled
  to open in October and November, taking the group’s total to almost 500.
