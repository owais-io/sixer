  Dead Man’s Wire review – Gus Van Sant calls the shots with surreal true-crime
  thriller

  With terrific chutzpah, black-comic flair and cool, cruel unsentimentality,
  screenwriter Austin Kolodney and director Gus Van Sant have made a true-crime
  suspense thriller set in the 1970s, tapping into the spirit of both Sidney
  Lumet’s Dog Day Afternoon and Network. Apart from anything else, it is a
  reminder that in that post-Kennedy, post-Watergate age, plenty of lawless and
  febrile things happened that would now be considered phenomena purely
  attributable to social media. In 1977, an Indianapolis businessman named Tony
  Kiritsis, with many acquaintances in the police department, kidnapped a
  mortgage broker named Richard Hall, and tied Hall’s neck with a “dead man’s
  wire” to his shotgun, which would therefore go off if police sharpshooters
  tried to kill him. Kiritsis even paraded his victim like this on TV while he
  read out his demands, a grotesque display in which national TV networks were
  blandly complicit. Van Sant’s recreation of this extraordinary moment calls to
  mind the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in front of police and
  press. Kiritsis had mortgaged himself to buy land he thought could be
  developed as a shopping mall, but fell behind with the loan repayments and
  became convinced – perhaps not without reason – that Hall and his fellow
  mortgage broker father were manipulating and exploiting the situation with
  secret designs on his land. Bill Skarsgård, as tense and pop-eyed as a
  character in The Simpsons, plays the paranoid and rage-filled Kiritsis; Dacre
  Montgomery is the unhappy Hall imprisoned in Kiritsis’s apartment with the
  wire-noose around his throat and the shotgun barrel jammed to his neck for 72
  hours straight. Al Pacino has an uproarious cameo in the “southern gentleman”
  voice that he has adopted these days, as Hall’s high-handed father who refuses
  to give Kiritsis the apology he wants over the phone and even jeers at his son
  for having “Stockholm syndrome”. Myha’la (from TV’s Industry) plays
  fictionalised TV reporter Linda Page determined not to be cheated of her
  scoop, and Colman Domingo has a richly enjoyable role as imperturbably
  laid-back radio DJ and phone-in host Fred Temple, based on the real life
  Indianapolis radio star Fred Heckman, whom Kiritsis actually did call up to
  broadcast his grievances on the air. What is extraordinary about this drama is
  that, played another way, Hall’s unspeakable ordeal – for that is surely what
  it was – would be material for something deeply and almost unthinkably
  shocking. But Hall’s mental health and what would presumably be lifelong PTSD
  is given scant attention here, mimicking the media and the courts at the time
  who were instead infatuated by the issue of whether Kiritsis was insane and if
  he was therefore entitled to an insanity plea. (By contrast,the US’s other
  great kidnapping case of the time, the 1974 abduction of Jack Teich, was the
  subject of Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s novel Long Island Compromise, which
  explored the idea of generational PTSD that went down to the victim’s
  children.) The personae and performances of Pacino, Domingo and Myha’la
  complicate the psychopathic nastiness of the affair, and create something
  surreal and bizarre and often hilarious: a display of, not heartlessness,
  exactly, but a shrewd professional sense that pity and fear were emotions that
  could only benefit the kidnapper. It’s a gripping picture with excellent
  performances. • Dead Man’s Wire screened at the Venice film festival.
