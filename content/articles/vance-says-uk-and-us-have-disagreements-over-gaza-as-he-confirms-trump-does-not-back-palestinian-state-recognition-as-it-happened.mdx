  not back Palestinian state recognition – as it happened

  JD Vance, the US vice president, has said that he does not “know what it would
  mean” for the UK to recognise Palestinian statehood. He also said that
  President Trump would not be following Keir Starmer, who announced last week
  that the UK is on course to recognise the state of Palestine in September.
  Vance was speaking alongside David Lammy in a brief press conference at
  Chevening, the foreign secretary’s grace-and-favour residence, at the start of
  what is a mostly social visit. Vance, who is having a family holiday in
  England, admitted that the US and the UK have some “disagreements” over Gaza
  policy, but the two men were keen to stress the strength of the UK/US
  relationship, as well as their personal friendship. Keir Starmer denounced the
  Israeli government’s decision to take over Gaza City, agreed overnight, saying
  it will “only bring more bloodshed”. The Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the
  Green party have also strongly criticised the Israeli move, and this afternoon
  the Greens have joined the SNP in demanding the recall of parliament to
  discuss the situation. The Green MP Ellie Chowns said: We need to recall
  parliament immediately to hold the UK government to account, to urgently
  assess whether we are meeting our obligations under the Genocide Convention,
  and to enact immediate measures — including sanctions on the Israeli cabinet
  and suspension of all military cooperation and arms sales — to prevent further
  atrocities. The Conservative party and Reform UK have not commented officially
  on the Israeli move. Instead, they have both been tweeting about migrants. The
  independent MP Rupert Lowe has agreed to donate £1,000 to a charity after
  mistaking its rowing crew, including a former Royal Marine, for possible
  “illegal migrants”. For a full list of all the stories covered on the blog
  today, do scroll through the list of key event headlines near the top of the
  blog. Vance said he was not taking any more questions, but a reporter asked
  Lammy if he thought his relationship with Vance might help the US and the UK
  agree a position on a ceasefire in Gaza. Lammy said Keir Starmer discusses
  these issues with President Trump on a weekly basis. They all want a
  ceasefire, he said. And they all want the hostages out. He went on: We are
  hugely concerned by the humanitarian suffering that we’re seeing in Gaza … I
  am concerned about what is developing in Gaza at this time, and the recent
  decision by the [Israeli] cabinet. I’m hugely concerned, as I think a lot of
  Israeli people are, about the impact, particularly on the hostages, and we’ll
  be able to discuss these issues in the hours ahead. And that was the end of
  the questions. Lammy’s language was a lot weaker than what has been said by
  most British politicians commenting on the Netanyahu decision today, including
  Keir Starmer. (See 9.04am.) Q: Will you be raising concerns about free speech
  in the UK in your talks with Lammy? You have talked about that before? Vance
  said he had also raised concerns about free speech in the US. He went on: I
  think the entire collective west, the transatlantic relationship, our Nato
  allies, certainly the United States under the Biden administration, got a
  little too comfortable with censoring rather than engaging with a diverse
  array of opinions. So that’s been my view. Obviously, I’ve raised some
  criticism and concerns about our friends on this side of the Atlantic. But the
  thing that I’d say to the people of England or anybody else, to David, is many
  of the things that I worry most about were happening in the United States from
  2020 to 2024. I just don’t want other countries to follow us down what I think
  was a very dark path under the Biden administration. At that point Vance tried
  to wrap up the Q&amp;A. Asked if the US was given prior warning of Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s decision to order the occupation of Gaza City, Vance said he was
  not going to talk about private conversations. He said he expected President
  Trump to speak to the media himself about this. He repeated his point about
  the US being focused on making sure Hamas could not attack Israel again, and
  dealing with the humanitarian crisis is Gaza. The US government was “in
  constant negotiations and conversations” about the aid situation, he said. But
  it was not simple, he said. It’s a tough situation. Of course, we’re not going
  to know exactly how to solve a very complicated problem. As the president has
  said himself, the people, in some ways, have been fighting for thousands of
  years. If it was easy to bring peace to that region of the world, it would
  have been done already. Q: What did you think of President Trump saying
  recently you were his “most likely” successor in 2028? Vance said he did not
  want to talk about “lowly things like politics in this grand house”. He went
  on: I think my view on the politics of 2028 is I’m not really focused even on
  the election in 2026, much less one two years after that. And if we do a good
  job for the American people, the politics will take care of itself. So I’m
  going to try to do a good job for the American people, just as David’s trying
  to do a good job for the people of UK. Q: What do you think of the UK’s
  decision to recognise the state of Palestine? Vance says this is one of the
  issues he and Lammy will discuss. He goes on: Obviously, the United Kingdom is
  going to make its decision. We have no plans to recognise a Palestinian state.
  I don’t know what it would mean to really recognise a Palestinian state, given
  the lack of functional government there. And what the president has made very
  clear is our two goals are very simple right now, vis-a-vis the situation in
  Israel and Gaza. Number one, we want to make it so that Hamas cannot attack
  innocent Israeli civilians ever again, and we think that has to come through
  the eradication of Hamas. Second, the president has been very moved by these
  terrible images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. So we want to make sure
  that we solve that problem. I think all of us can work on how to solve that
  problem. Obviously, it’s not an easy problem to solve, or it would have
  already been dealt with, but we share, I think, that focus and that goal. We
  may have some disagreements about how exactly to accomplish that goal, and
  we’ll talk about that today. Vance is now replying. He says his children have
  been sleeping on Lammy’s floor already, and they caught fish. He praises Kent.
  It is great to be here in Kent again. My wife and I love this area of the UK.
  We actually were here a couple of years ago. We went to Dover and to the
  cathedral in Canterbury. So we love this country. We certainly love this part
  of the country, and so it’s great to be here. He says they have big issues to
  discuss. But he also says Lammy is a good friend, and their children get on
  well, he says. He ends by praising the house. I really love this country – and
  in particular, having never been to this beautiful house before and seen the
  surrounding area – I just say that the people who built it, the people who
  sustained it, I think, really love the human spirit, and being here lifts up
  the human spirit. Lammy is doing the opening spiel. He says: I’ve spent lots
  of time in the US, and I’m very, very fond of the country. Our bilateral
  relations are in a wonderful place, having struck our economic prosperity deal
  and working hard on a new technology partnership, which will be very, very
  exciting. Today, of course, we will be discussing the developing situation in
  the Middle East and in Gaza, which is of great concern. And of course, the
  ongoing war in Ukraine, and our desire to see that come to an end. He ends by
  saying: “Welcome to my home here.” (Technically, it is not really his home. It
  is a grace-and-favour property, traditionally allocated to the foreign
  secretary.) David Lammy and JD Vance are about to speak to the media from a
  room in Chevening. Or maybe they are speaking already. The signal from
  Chevening does not seem to be very good, and the footage froze at first. The
  SNP is calling for the recall of parliament so that MPs can approve sanctions
  against Benjamin Netanyahu in the light of his decision to extend the
  occupation of Gaza. In a statement Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at
  Westminster, said: A genocide is happening before our eyes in Gaza. Words of
  condemnation aren’t anywhere near enough - if we have any hope of stopping
  this genocide strong actions are desperately needed, now. That means Keir
  Starmer needs to recall Westminster and take concrete steps to sanction the
  Israeli government. Those sanctions must include ending all arms sales to the
  Israeli military, stopping all training, logistical and military support to
  the IDF, directly and personally sanctioning Netanyahu and his ministers and
  finally and immediately recognising the state of Palestine before it is
  brutally wiped off the map. If the international community fails to act - we
  are consciously and complicitly standing idly by - allowing Benjamin Netanyahu
  to plan, implement and inflict an ongoing genocide in Gaza. Technically
  parliament does not need to be recalled for the UK government to impose
  sanctions on Netanyahu, but the recall of parliament (which almost certainly
  will not happen over this) would be a powerful act of political messaging.
  There is no word yet as to what David Lammy, the foreign secretary, and JD
  Vance, the US vice president, have been talking about at Chevening today, but
  we do have a picture of them fishing together in the lake there. An IT bug
  causing “technical issues” within the body running courts in England and Wales
  is “unbelievably serious” and could be compared to the Post Office Horizon
  scandal, a former justice secretary has said. The BBC has reported that it
  took HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service (HMCTS) several years to react to the
  bug, which is said to have caused evidence to go missing, be overwritten or
  appear lost, resulting in judges in civil, family and tribunal courts making
  rulings on cases when evidence was potentially incomplete. PA Media reports:
  HMCTS said there is no evidence to suggest any case outcomes were affected as
  a result of the issues. The bug was found in case-management software used by
  HMCTS and the Social Security and Child Support (SSCS) Tribunal, which handles
  benefit appeals, is thought to have been most affected, according to the BBC.
  Referred to as Judicial Case Manager, MyHMCTS or CCD, the BBC said the
  software is used to manage evidence and track cases, and is used by judges,
  lawyers, case workers and members of the public. Documents seen by the BBC
  show the bug caused data to be obscured from view, meaning some evidence was
  sometimes not visible as part of case files used in court. The BBC said a
  leaked internal report said HMCTS did not know the full extent of the data
  corruption, including whether or how it had affected cases. Alex Chalk, a
  former justice secretary, said what has happened was “incredibly serious” and
  could have involved cases which determine whether a child is taken into care.
  Chalk told the Today programme: “And the thing that is so troubling is that
  this report evidently got on to the desk of the senior leadership of HMCTS in
  March 2024 when I was in office, and it was never brought to my attention.
  “And I am incredibly troubled by that, because any lord chancellor, of any
  stripe, if they discover that there’s potentially a situation in the courts
  which is leading to injustice, then you will immediately want to investigate
  that, and yet in effect that was covered up and I’m afraid I think that is
  extremely serious.” The BBC said several sources within HMCTS have likened the
  situation to the Horizon Post Office scandal. Chalk was asked on Today if what
  has happened could be compared to the Post Office scandal, and he said: “It
  could be.” An HMCTS spokesperson said: “Our internal investigation found no
  evidence that any case outcomes were affected as a result of these technical
  issues. The digitisation of our systems is vital to bring courts and tribunals
  into the modern era and provide quicker, simpler access to justice for all
  those who use our services. We will continue to press ahead with our important
  modernisation.” It is understood that while the bug resulted in some documents
  not being accessible to users on the digital platform, they were in fact
  always present on the system. It is also understood that because of a number
  of “fail-safes”, parties and judges involved in these cases always had access
  to the documents they needed. The Times is running a story today saying that
  Israel is considering withdrawing defence and security cooperation from the UK
  if Keir Starmer goes ahead with his plan to recognise Palestininian statehood
  in September. In their story, which is based on comments from unnamed sources,
  Matt Dathan, the paper’s home affairs editor, and Gabrielle Weiniger, the
  paper’s Israel correspondent, say: Diplomatic sources have told The Times that
  Binyamin Netanyahu’s government is examining the response as one of a range of
  options if Britain presses ahead with Palestinian recognition next month. An
  official warned that Britain and other countries considering diplomatic
  recognition should “carefully consider” the consequences of such a move.
  Another diplomatic source said: “London needs to be careful because Bibi
  [Netanyahu] and his ministers have cards they could play too. Israel values
  its partnership with the UK but recent decisions mean it is coming under
  pressure and the UK has a lot to lose if Israel’s government decides to take
  steps in response.” Dathan and Weiniger say that “Israel intelligence has
  provided crucial information to Britain’s spy agencies about Iranian-backed
  threats in the UK”, and also that British arms producers rely to a great
  extent on components from Israeli companies. Reports like this help to explain
  why Keir Starmer, like previous prime ministers, has been more supportive of
  Israel than critics of its treatment of Palestinians would wish. But ministers
  will have to decide to what extent threats like this are a bluff. Given the
  conditions that Starmer set for the UK not to go ahead and recognise
  Palestinian statehood in September, and Israel’s response, it would be
  impossible for Starmer to withdraw the recognition proposals (as Israel wants)
  without a colossal loss of face. In a statement about the latest decision from
  the Israeli government, the independent MP and former Labour leader, Jeremy
  Corbyn, has restated his claim that the UK is complicit in genocide. If the
  government was truly horrified by Israel’s occupation of Gaza, it would stop
  supplying them with the weapons they need to carry it out. The prime minister
  can condemn Israel’s plans all he wants. He cannot hide the truth: his
  government is complicit in genocide. John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister,
  says Israel’s decision to occupy Gaza City is “completely and utterly
  unacceptable”. In a message on social media, the SNP leader said: The decision
  of the Israeli government to seize control of Gaza City is completely and
  utterly unacceptable. It will create even more human suffering for the
  Palestinian people and further escalate the conflict. The international
  community must stop Israel and secure a ceasefire. The Green party has also
  called for the end of all arms sales to Israel. Ellie Chowns, the Green MP and
  a candidate to be co-leader in the current leadership contest, posted this on
  social media. Netanyahu’s brutal plan to take control of Gaza is yet another
  declaration of intent to commit war crimes. The UK must do more than express
  disapproval: end military cooperation and arms sales, recognise Palestine,
  demand an immediate ceasefire and accountability for war crimes. The Liberal
  Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has also condemned Israel’s decision to expand the
  takeover of Gaza. Davey said: [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s plans to occupy the whole
  of Gaza are utterly abhorrent – and it’s increasingly clear that his goal is
  ethnic cleansing. This plan will only serve to wreak more devastation on the
  lives of millions of Gazans – whose homes and communities have already been
  destroyed – while endangering the lives of those hostages still held by Hamas.
  Rather than sitting on its hands and issuing strongly worded statements, the
  UK government needs to take decisive action. Keir Starmer needs to stop the
  export of all UK arms to Israel – today – and sanction Netanyahu and his
  cabinet. The independent MP Rupert Lowe has agreed to donate £1,000 to a
  charity after mistaking its rowing crew, including a former Royal Marine, for
  “illegal migrants”, Kevin Rawlinson reports. Here is the message that Lowe
  posted on X last night about the “illegal migrants”. Quite why Lowe thought
  small boat migrants might be landing at Great Yarmouth is a mystery. It is 90
  nautical miles from Calais (from where the boats normally leave), and 85
  nautical miles from Dover (where they normally land, or are brought shore).
  And here is the message Lowe posted this morning owning up to his mistake.
  Good news. False alarm! The unknown vessel was charity rowers, thank goodness.
  As a well done to the crew, I’ll donate £1,000 to their charity – raising
  money for MND. Keep going, and watch out for any real illegal migrants! We
  received a huge number of urgent complaints from constituents – I make no
  apologies over being vigilant for my constituents. It is a national crisis. No
  mass deportations for the charity rowers, but we definitely need it for the
  illegal migrants! Good morning. Keir Starmer has this morning denounced the
  Israeli government’s decision to take over Gaza City, agreed overnight, saying
  it will “only bring more bloodshed”. He has been under growing pressure for a
  long time, from within the Labour party, as well as from the Liberal
  Democrats, the Greens and the Corbyn/Sultana independent leftwingers, to be
  more critical of Israel, and that led to the decision last week to recognise
  the state of Palestine. This morning’s statement, which will almost certainly
  have no practical impact but which is marginally stronger than what Starmer
  has been saying in the past, is fresh evidence of a shift in thinking. In his
  statement, Starmer said: The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate
  its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately. This
  action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the
  release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed. Every day the
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held
  in appalling and inhuman conditions. What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in
  humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated
  solution. Hamas can play no part in the future of Gaza and must leave as well
  as disarm. Together with our allies, we are working on a long-term plan to
  secure peace in the region as part of a two-state solution, and ultimately
  achieve a brighter future for Palestinians and Israelis. But without both
  sides engaging in good faith in negotiations, that prospect is vanishing
  before our eyes. Our message is clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but
  both parties must step away from the path of destruction. Amy Sedghi has more
  coverage, with the global perspective, on our Middle East live blog. There is
  not much happening in UK politics today, but the only item in the diary is
  David Lammy, the foreign secretary, hosting JD Vance, the US vice-president,
  at Chevening. Vance is starting a family holiday in England, and the visit is
  mostly social (Daniel Boffey has a good account of the counter-intuitive
  Lammy/Vance friendship here), but the two men are also due to have a formal
  bilateral at around lunchtime and Gaza is bound to come up. If you want to
  contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open
  (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.
  I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed
  at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that
  word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social
  media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The
  Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual
  Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me
  there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it
  very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is
  too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t
  promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can,
  either BTL or sometimes in the blog.

Chalk was asked on Today if what has happened could be compared to the Post Office scandal, and he said: “It could be.” An HMCTS spokesperson said: “Our internal investigation found no evidence that any case outcomes were affected as a result of these technical issues. The digitisation of our systems is vital to bring courts and tribunals into the modern era and provide quicker, simpler access to justice for all those who use our services. We will continue to press ahead with our important modernisation.” It is understood that while the bug resulted in some documents not being accessible to users on the digital platform, they were in fact always present on the system. It is also understood that because of a number of “fail-safes”, parties and judges involved in these cases always had access to the documents they needed. The Times is running a story today saying that Israel is considering withdrawing defence and security cooperation from the UK if Keir Starmer goes ahead with his plan to recognise Palestininian statehood in September. In their story, which is based on comments from unnamed sources, Matt Dathan, the paper’s home affairs editor, and Gabrielle Weiniger, the paper’s Israel correspondent, say: Diplomatic sources have told The Times that Binyamin Netanyahu’s government is examining the response as one of a range of options if Britain presses ahead with Palestinian recognition next month. An official warned that Britain and other countries considering diplomatic recognition should “carefully consider” the consequences of such a move. Another diplomatic source said: “London needs to be careful because Bibi [Netanyahu] and his ministers have cards they could play too. Israel values its partnership with the UK but recent decisions mean it is coming under pressure and the UK has a lot to lose if Israel’s government decides to take steps in response.” Dathan and Weiniger say that “Israel intelligence has provided crucial information to Britain’s spy agencies about Iranian-backed threats in the UK”, and also that British arms producers rely to a great extent on components from Israeli companies. Reports like this help to explain why Keir Starmer, like previous prime ministers, has been more supportive of Israel than critics of its treatment of Palestinians would wish. But ministers will have to decide to what extent threats like this are a bluff. Given the conditions that Starmer set for the UK not to go ahead and recognise Palestinian statehood in September, and Israel’s response, it would be impossible for Starmer to withdraw the recognition proposals (as Israel wants) without a colossal loss of face. In a statement about the latest decision from the Israeli government, the independent MP and former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has restated his claim that the UK is complicit in genocide. If the government was truly horrified by Israel’s occupation of Gaza, it would stop supplying them with the weapons they need to carry it out. The prime minister can condemn Israel’s plans all he wants. He cannot hide the truth: his government is complicit in genocide. John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, says Israel’s decision to occupy Gaza City is “completely and utterly unacceptable”. In a message on social media, the SNP leader said: The decision of the Israeli government to seize control of Gaza City is completely and utterly unacceptable. It will create even more human suffering for the Palestinian people and further escalate the conflict. The international community must stop Israel and secure a ceasefire. The Green party has also called for the end of all arms sales to Israel. Ellie Chowns, the Green MP and a candidate to be co-leader in the current leadership contest, posted this on social media. Netanyahu’s brutal plan to take control of Gaza is yet another declaration of intent to commit war crimes. The UK must do more than express disapproval: end military cooperation and arms sales, recognise Palestine, demand an immediate ceasefire and accountability for war crimes. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has also condemned Israel’s decision to expand the takeover of Gaza. Davey said: [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s plans to occupy the whole of Gaza are utterly abhorrent – and it’s increasingly clear that his goal is ethnic cleansing. This plan will only serve to wreak more devastation on the lives of millions of Gazans – whose homes and communities have already been destroyed – while endangering the lives of those hostages still held by Hamas. Rather than sitting on its hands and issuing strongly worded statements, the UK government needs to take decisive action. Keir Starmer needs to stop the export of all UK arms to Israel – today – and sanction Netanyahu and his cabinet. The independent MP Rupert Lowe has agreed to donate £1,000 to a charity after mistaking its rowing crew, including a former Royal Marine, for “illegal migrants”, Kevin Rawlinson reports. Here is the message that Lowe posted on X last night about the “illegal migrants”. Quite why Lowe thought small boat migrants might be landing at Great Yarmouth is a mystery. It is 90 nautical miles from Calais (from where the boats normally leave), and 85 nautical miles from Dover (where they normally land, or are brought shore). And here is the message Lowe posted this morning owning up to his mistake. Good news. False alarm! The unknown vessel was charity rowers, thank goodness. As a well done to the crew, I’ll donate £1,000 to their charity – raising money for MND. Keep going, and watch out for any real illegal migrants! We received a huge number of urgent complaints from constituents – I make no apologies over being vigilant for my constituents. It is a national crisis. No mass deportations for the charity rowers, but we definitely need it for the illegal migrants! Good morning. Keir Starmer has this morning denounced the Israeli government’s decision to take over Gaza City, agreed overnight, saying it will “only bring more bloodshed”. He has been under growing pressure for a long time, from within the Labour party, as well as from the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Corbyn/Sultana independent leftwingers, to be more critical of Israel, and that led to the decision last week to recognise the state of Palestine. This morning’s statement, which will almost certainly have no practical impact but which is marginally stronger than what Starmer has been saying in the past, is fresh evidence of a shift in thinking. In his statement, Starmer said: The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately. This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed. Every day the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held in appalling and inhuman conditions. What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated solution. Hamas can play no part in the future of Gaza and must leave as well as disarm. Together with our allies, we are working on a long-term plan to secure peace in the region as part of a two-state solution, and ultimately achieve a brighter future for Palestinians and Israelis. But without both sides engaging in good faith in negotiations, that prospect is vanishing before our eyes. Our message is clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but both parties must step away from the path of destruction. Amy Sedghi has more coverage, with the global perspective, on our Middle East live blog. There is not much happening in UK politics today, but the only item in the diary is David Lammy, the foreign secretary, hosting JD Vance, the US vice-president, at Chevening. Vance is starting a family holiday in England, and the visit is mostly social (Daniel Boffey has a good account of the counter-intuitive Lammy/Vance friendship here), but the two men are also due to have a formal bilateral at around lunchtime and Gaza is bound to come up.

I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.
