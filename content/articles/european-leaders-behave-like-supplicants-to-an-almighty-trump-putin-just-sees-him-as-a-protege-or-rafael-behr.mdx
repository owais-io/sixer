  A hungry pigeon given food at frequent but irregular intervals will develop
  weird rituals – tics, dances, erratic head jerks – in the hope of summoning
  another morsel. BF Skinner, the psychologist who first demonstrated this
  effect in 1947, described the birds adopting “a sort of superstition … as if
  there were a causal relation between its behaviour and the presentation of
  food, although such a relation is lacking”. It would be unkind to compare that
  bird-brained affliction to the behaviour of European leaders trying to make
  sense of Donald Trump’s erratic distribution of favours. Their diplomatic
  manoeuvres are more rational. And they get results. But there is also an
  element of superstition. Visiting politicians make lavish gestures, strike
  unusual poses, cultivate White House contacts, looking for the sequence of
  steps that will unlock a steady supply of American amity. The causal relation
  is not lacking, but it is unreliable. In February, Keir Starmer wooed Trump
  with an invitation to visit Britain as a guest of his majesty the king. The
  prime minister was rewarded with relative leniency under the White House’s
  punitive tariff regime. In March, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb,
  impressed his US counterpart with technical prowess on the golf course.
  Between shots, he seeded the conversation with warnings not to trust Vladimir
  Putin. There followed a discernible dip in Trump’s patience with the Russian
  president. At a summit in June, Nato leaders presented hikes in their national
  defence budgets as tributes paid in honour of the US president’s superior
  statecraft. The alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, performed a
  rhetorical kowtow, praising “daddy” Trump, thanking him for making Europe pay
  more for its own defence. Choreographed sycophancy seemed to work. Trump spoke
  of Nato with uncharacteristic warmth. His tone towards Russia turned chillier.
  It didn’t last. Putin countered with his own campaign of flattery. Trump
  emerged from last week’s bilateral summit in Alaska with a roadmap to peace in
  Ukraine that followed twisted Kremlin directions – no imminent ceasefire and
  cessions of unconquered land to Russia. And so the ritual dance began anew. A
  flock of European pigeons raced to Washington, cooing and flapping in support
  of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hoping to generate a fresh
  portion of transatlantic solidarity. The result could have been a lot worse.
  There was no repeat of the notorious ritual humiliation that Trump inflicted
  on Zelenskyy for the cameras in February. In place of bullying there was
  bonhomie. On the substance of a peace settlement, there is talk of security
  guarantees for Ukraine resembling but not replicating article 5 – the mutual
  assistance clause of Nato’s founding charter. What that really means, how it
  might be enforced, whether it will be underwritten by US military might and
  therefore how deterred Russia would be from any renewed landgrabs are all
  questions left hanging. The next stage is a proposed face-to-face meeting
  between Zelenskyy and Putin, followed by a trilateral summit with Trump. The
  Russian president is reported to be open to the idea of direct talks with his
  Ukrainian enemy, but there is no enthusiasm for such an encounter in the
  Kremlin. To justify full-scale invasion, Putin cast Zelenskyy as the despised
  boss of a drug-addled, neo-Nazi junta preventing Ukraine’s eager reintegration
  into the greater slavic motherland. When that fiction proved hard to sustain,
  the emphasis shifted to presenting the Ukrainian leader as a pawn in a
  long-running western campaign to diminish and humiliate Russia. That story was
  meant to end with Zelenskyy’s death or surrender. It will not be easy for
  Moscow propagandists to narrate a different denouement where the Ukrainian
  president talks terms with Putin as his unvanquished peer. Avoiding such a
  scenario had been one of the Russian president’s two big achievements in
  Alaska. First, by insisting on a bilateral meeting, Putin was able to bounce
  Trump into endorsing a template for peace that contains no hint of rebuke or
  reparation for flagrant territorial aggression. Second, by recreating the
  optics of cold war detente – a superpower summit to settle the fate of lesser
  nations – Putin signalled to his domestic audience that Soviet-style parity
  with the US was restored. To European democracies he hoped to prove that their
  efforts at isolating Russia as a thuggish pariah state would come to naught.
  The notion of Russia as America’s equal on any measure of power (except the
  size of nuclear arsenal) was a delusion even before the USSR unravelled, but
  one that Trump willingly indulges. It is a corollary of his obsession with
  making America great again, and doing so by authoritarian measures. It
  predisposes him to denigrate the accomplishments of 20th-century US democracy
  and project greatness on to regimes that showcase despotism under a
  personality cult. Putin is skilled at manipulating that attraction. While
  European leaders lobby Trump in the style of supplicants at the court of a
  king, Russia’s modern tsar cultivates him as something more like a protege – a
  recruit to the exclusive club of world historical figures who dictate the
  destiny of millions. They are the kind of men who redraw borders and parcel
  out land among themselves, not the kind that whines when the territorial
  allocation is unfair. It is a concept of geopolitics that despises
  international law and denigrates multilateral alliances as crafty games that
  minnow countries play to trap the big fish. That speaks to Trump’s
  narcissistic personality and aversion to any institutional constraint on his
  power. It means the Russian president is communicating with the White House on
  his own special channel, on a higher frequency. European counter-signals
  aren’t blocked. The evidence shows real success in shifting Trump away from a
  policy of unthinking pro-Kremlin alignment. But there is a perverse imbalance
  of influence. Just when the leaders of America’s oldest and most loyal allies
  think they have mastered the art of Trump-whispering, they find his ears have
  been thoroughly bent by Russian disinformation. In the short term, there isn’t
  an obvious alternative but to carry on with the current method, using force of
  numbers and repetition to persuade Trump that his route to greatness goes by
  way of durable Ukrainian independence with muscular security guarantees. It is
  certainly feasible that the Europeans’ diplomatic dance can nudge the
  president’s position in a more equitable direction on the road to a peace
  deal. But they will not effect any revision of his view of a world divided
  between mighty power players, to whom no rules apply, and vassal states. The
  challenge then is to develop European capacity as a coherent and autonomous
  power player – to evolve and coordinate the continent’s economic and military
  heft with confidence and on a scale to command respect in the only language
  the US president understands. The current approach isn’t exactly failing. But
  Trump-whispering is an unstable and inherently transient method at best. At
  worst it starts to look like a superstitious belief that performing the
  rituals of an old alliance will conjure it back into being. The right pigeon
  steps can win vital favours from the US president. The idea that he could ever
  be the true friend Europe wants him to be is for the birds. Rafael Behr is a
