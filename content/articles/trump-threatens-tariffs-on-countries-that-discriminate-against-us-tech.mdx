  Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs and export restrictions on
  countries whose taxes, legislation and regulations target US big tech
  companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Apple. In a post on the US
  president’s social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said “digital taxes,
  legislation, rules or regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate
  against, American technology”. He added that such measures, which includes the
  UK’s digital services tax that raises about £800m annually from global tech
  companies through a 2% levy on revenues, also “outrageously give a complete
  pass to China’s largest tech companies”. “As the president of the United
  States, I will stand up to countries that attack our incredible American tech
  companies,” said Trump. “Unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I,
  as president of the United States, will impose substantial additional tariffs
  on that country’s exports to the USA, and institute export restrictions on our
  highly protected technology and chips.” Trump’s threat puts pressure on the UK
  and EU – which also has in place regulations to curb the power of big tech
  companies through the Digital Services Act – which both struck recent trade
  agreements with the US. Several EU member states, including France, Italy and
  Spain, also have digital services taxes in place. US officials have criticised
  the UK’s digital services tax (DST), which has been in place since 2020,
  although it was kept in place after the deal with the Trump administration
  that was reached in May. Trump has complained about the impact that DSTs
  around the world are having on US companies. In February, he issued an
  executive order – titled Defending American Companies and Innovators from
  Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties – threatening tariffs in
  retaliation. In April, it emerged that Keir Starmer offered big US tech
  companies a reduction in the headline rate of the DST to placate Trump, while
  at the same time applying the levy to companies from other countries.
  “America, and American technology companies, are neither the ‘piggy bank’ nor
  the ‘doormat’ of the world any longer,” Trump said on Monday. “Show respect to
  America and our amazing tech companies or consider the consequences.” The
  warning from the president comes a week after the US and the EU agreed in a
  joint statement that they would together “address unjustified trade barriers”.
  However, the EU said separately that it had not committed to alter any digital
  regulations. In June, Canada scrapped its digital services tax, which Trump
  had described as a “direct and blatant” attack, in an effort to smooth trade
  negotiations with its neighbour.
