  Good Night, Oscar review – Sean Hayes brings panache to tense talkshow
  encounter

  There is a small set of stage plays in which the younger, upstart medium of
  television is the hero: Peter Morgan’s Frost/Nixon, James Graham’s Best of
  Enemies and Aaron Sorkin’s The Farnsworth Invention. This genre is swelled by
  Doug Wright’s Good Night, Oscar, a 2024 Broadway success now transferring,
  with some English cast substitutions, to London. In common with the Morgan and
  Graham dramas, it is set around a notable television interview. The early
  realisation in TV that millions of viewers would happily sit on sofas to watch
  celebrities chatting on chairs meant that the role of talkshow host – Jack
  Paar, Johnny Carson, David Frost, Michael Parkinson – soon evolved a breed of
  alpha guests: Peter Ustinov, Kenneth Williams, Robin Williams and, in America,
  Oscar Levant, a classical pianist and movie supporting actor (An American in
  Paris) who became a waspish and risque late-night anecdotalist. Wright
  imagines a 1958 encounter between Paar (Ben Rappaport) and Levant (Sean
  Hayes), in which, just before a ratings-crucial broadcast, the presenter
  discovers that his star guest, who will also play out the show at the piano,
  has recently been committed to a mental health facility. Scenes of off-air and
  on-air tension alternate. As in the 1996 movie Shine – also turning on whether
  a psychiatric patient will succeed with a complex piano piece – there is a
  risk of glorifying the myth that men (as they generally are) with identified
  conditions can do much what they want. Also, in a play that explicitly hymns
  integrity and honesty in the entertainment industry, it feels queasy that the
  events depicted in Good Night, Oscar never occurred as shown. Levant was once
  released from a mental health facility to guest on a quiz show but the play’s
  fictional transference of this incident to The Tonight Show on its first
  transmission from the west coast injects false jeopardy and adds to a sense of
  moral confusion. Wright follows the standard stance of stage plays set in
  television – also found in Sorkin’s screen-about-screen work, The Newsroom and
  Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip – that a potentially beautiful and influential
  medium is ruined by greedy and censorious executives. That’s a fair view but
  in Good Night, Oscar the spoilsport NBC honcho must decide whether someone is
  physically fit to appear. Audiences encouraged to despise network chief Bob
  Sarnoff (Richard Katz) for trying to keep a seriously unwell man off air would
  perhaps soon join calls for the sacking of broadcast bosses who failed in
  their “duty of care” by allowing such a vulnerable person to broadcast now. As
  Levant, Hayes gives a performance of such busyness – twitches, tics, lip
  curls, cigarette business – that you wonder if the stage has a fast-forward
  button. He also, in the moment that surely guaranteed his Tony award, delivers
  the piano climax live at a Steinway with exceptional panache. Lisa Peterson’s
  slick, whizzy production, co-starring Rosalie Craig as Levant’s wife June, is
  a thrilling theatrical experience but, perhaps perversely for a play arguing
  for television to be more serious, does not bear looking at too closely. • At
  the Barbican theatre, London, until 21 September
