  conspiracy’ against Trump

  A former CIA officer who helped lead the intelligence assessments over alleged
  Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election has said Tulsi Gabbard,
  the director of national intelligence, is ignorant of the practices of
  espionage after she accused Barack Obama and his national security team of
  “treasonous conspiracy” against Donald Trump. Susan Miller, the agency’s head
  of counter-intelligence at the time of the election, told the Guardian that
  Gabbard’s allegations were based on false statements and basic
  misrepresentations of discoveries made by Miller’s team about Russian actions,
  which she insisted were based on multiple trusted and verified sources.
  Gabbard has accused Obama and his former national security officials of
  “manufacturing” intelligence to make it appear that Russia’s president,
  Vladimir Putin, had intervened on Trump’s side when they knew it was untrue.
  The goal, she insisted, was to make Trump’s election win appear illegitimate,
  thus laying the basis of a “years-long coup against him”. She has passed the
  matter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, who last week announced a justice
  department “strike force” into the affair. However, reports have suggested
  that Bondi was caught off-guard by Gabbard’s request that her department
  examine the matter. Gabbard has called for criminal prosecutions against
  numerous officials involved, including Obama himself. Obama last week
  denounced the allegations as “outrageous and ridiculous”, and part of an
  attempt to distract attention from the Jeffrey Epstein files, in which Trump’s
  name reportedly appears. Until Wednesday, none of the other high-level
  officials named in Gabbard’s recent report – including James Clapper, her
  predecessor as national intelligence director; John Brennan, the former CIA
  director; or the ex-FBI director James Comey – had responded publicly to her
  allegations. Clapper and Brennan broke their silence for the first time on
  Wednesday with a jointly written op-ed article in the New York Times in which
  they called Gabbard’s allegations “patently false” and accused her of
  “rewrit[ing] history”. In an interview, Miller – who is not named in the
  national intelligence director’s public narrative – questioned Gabbard’s grasp
  of intelligence matters. Gabbard, who has never worked on the House
  intelligence committee while she was a member of Congress, has criticized the
  “tradecraft” of agents who compiled the assessment of Russia’s election
  activities. “Has she ever met a Russian agent?” asked Miller, a 39-year agency
  veteran who served tours as CIA chief of station abroad. “Has she ever given
  diamonds to a Russian who’s giving us, you know? Has she ever walked on the
  streets of Moscow to do a dead drop? Has she ever handled an agent? “No. She’s
  never done any of that. She clearly doesn’t understand this.” Miller told the
  Guardian she was speaking out because Gabbard’s claims besmirched her work and
  and that of her team of up to eight members who worked on the Russia case. “My
  reputation and my team’s reputation is on the line,” she said. “Tulsi comes
  out and doesn’t use my name, doesn’t use the names of the people in my team,
  but basically says this was all wrong and made up, et cetera.” Miller and her
  former team members have recently hired lawyers to defend themselves against
  charges that could put them in jail. Miller has hired Mark Zaid, a prominent
  Washington defense attorney, to represent her. The scenario reprises a
  situation she faced in 2017, when – still a serving officer – Miller hired a
  $1,500-an-hour lawyer to represent her after being told she might face
  criminal charges for her part in authoring the same intelligence report now
  being scrutinized by Gabbard. Investigators interviewed her for up to eight
  hours as part of a trawl to ferret out possible law-breaking under Obama that
  eventually that culminated in Bill Barr, the attorney general in Trump’s first
  administration, appointing a special counsel, John Durham, to conduct an
  inquiry into the FBI’s investigation of links between the Trump campaign and
  Russia. “They were asking things like: ‘Who told you to write this and who
  told you to come to these conclusions?’” Miller recalled. “I told them:
  ‘Nobody did. If anybody had told us to come to certain conclusions, all of us
  would have quit. There’s no way, all none of us ever had a reputation for
  falsifying anything, before anything or after.’” No charges were brought
  against her, but nor was she told the case was closed. Durham’s 2023 report
  concluded that the FBI should never have launched its full investigation,
  called “Crossfire Hurricane” into the alleged Trump-Russia links. But his
  four-year investigation was something of a disappointment to Trump and his
  supporters, bringing just three criminal prosecutions, resulting in a single
  conviction – of an FBI lawyer who admitted to altering an email to support a
  surveillance application. It is this ground that is now being re-covered by
  Gabbard in what may be a Trump-inspired bid for “retribution” against
  political enemies who he has accused of subjecting him to a political
  witch-hunt. But the crusade, Miller says, is underpinned by false premise –
  that the Russia interference findings were a “hoax”, a description long
  embraced by Trump and repeated by Gabbard in her 18 July report. “It is not a
  hoax,” she said. “This was based on real intelligence. It’s reporting we were
  getting from verified agents and from other verified streams of intelligence.
  “It was so clear [the Russians] were doing that, that it was never in issue
  back in 2016. It’s only an issue now because Tulsi wants it to be.” Briefing
  journalists at the White House last week, Gabbard cited a 2020 House of
  Representatives intelligence committee report – supported only by its
  Republican members – asserting that Putin’s goal in the election was to
  “undermine faith in the US democratic process, not showing any preference of a
  certain candidate”. Miller dismissed that. “The information led us to the
  correct conclusion that [the interference] was in Trump’s favor – the
  Republican party and Trump’s favor,” she said. Indeed, Putin himself –
  standing alongside Trump at a news conference during a summit meeting in
  Helsinki in 2018 – confirmed to journalists that he had wanted his US
  counterpart to win. Rebuffing suggestions that she or her team may be guilty
  of pro-Democrat bias, she said she was a registered Republican voter. Her team
  consisted of Republicans, Democrats and “centrists”, she said. Gabbard has
  claimed that agents were pressured – at Obama’s instigation – into fabricating
  intelligence in the weeks after Trump’s victory, allegedly to raise questions
  about its electoral legitimacy and weaken his presidency. “BS [bullshit].
  That’s not true,” said Miller. “This had to do with our sources and what they
  were finding. It had nothing to do with Obama telling us to do this. We found
  it, and we’re like, what do we do with this?” At the core of Gabbard’s
  critique are two assertions that Miller says conflates separate issues. One is
  based on media reports of briefings from Obama administration officials a
  month after Trump’s victory, including one claiming that Russia used “cyber
  products” to influence “the outcome of the election”. Gabbard writes that this
  is contradicted by Obama’s admission that there was no “evidence of [voting]
  machines being tampered with” to alter the vote tally, meaning that the
  eventual assessment finding of Russian interference must be false. Miller
  dismisses that as a red herring, since the CIA’s assessment – ultimately
  endorsed by other intelligence agencies – was never based on assumptions of
  election machine hacking. “That’s not where [the Russians] were trying to do
  it,” she said. “They were trying to do it through covert action of press
  pieces, internet pieces, things like that. The DNC [Democratic National
  Committee] hack [when Russian hackers also penetrated the emails of Clinton’s
  campaign chairman, John Podesta, and passed them to WikiLeaks] … is [also]
  part of it. “That’s why we came out with the conclusion that 100% the Russians
  tried to influence the election on Trump’s part, [but] 100%, unless we polled
  every voter, we can’t tell if it worked. If we’d known anything about election
  machines, it would have been a very different thing.” Miller also denied
  Gabbard’s claim that the intelligence community’s “high level of confidence”
  in Russian interference had been bolstered by “‘further information” that
  turned out to be an unverified dossier written by Christopher Steele, a former
  British intelligence officer, which suggested possible collusion between
  Russia and Trump. “We never used the Steele dossier in our report,” she said.
  The dossier – which included salacious allegations about Trump and Russian sex
  workers – created a media sensation when it was published without permission
  in January 2017 days before Trump’s inauguration. Miller said it was only
  included in an annex to the intelligence assessment released in the same month
  on the insistence of Comey, the FBI director, who had told his CIA
  counterpart, Brennan, that the bureau would not sign off on the rest of the
  report if it was excluded. “We never saw it until our report was 99.99%
  finished and about to go to print. We didn’t care about it or really
  understand it or where it had come from. It was too poorly written and
  non-understandable. “But we were told it had to be included or the FBI
  wouldn’t endorse our report. So it was put in as an addendum with a huge cover
  sheet on it, written by me and a team member, which said something like: ‘We
  are attaching this document, the Steele dossier, to this report at the request
  of the FBI director; it is unevaluated and not corroborated by CIA at this
  time.’”
