  An Israeli government cybersecurity official was reportedly arrested recently
  by Las Vegas police and other authorities in Nevada who were conducting an
  undercover investigation aimed at online users seeking to sexually prey on
  children. Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, 38, faces felony charges of luring a child
  with a computer for a sex act, alongside several other suspects who were
  apprehended during the two-week sting operation, the Las Vegas metropolitan
  police department said in a statement published on Friday. He has since been
  released from custody on $10,000 bail after an initial court appearance,
  records show, and returned to Israel. As first reported by the news site
  Mediaite, a publicly posted screenshot of Alexandrovich’s page on the LinkedIn
  professional networking platform described him as the executive director of
  the Israel Cyber Directorate, an Israeli government agency under the purview
  of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. Other information online
  attributes the same position to Alexandrovich. The screenshot first reported
  by Mediaite also showed a post under Alexandrovich’s name alluding to his
  having been in Las Vegas earlier in August for the Black Hat Briefings, a
  yearly meeting of cybersecurity professionals. “Two things you can’t escape at
  Black Hat 2025: the relentless buz of generative [artificial intelligence] and
  the sound of Hebrew … in every corridor,” Alexandrovich wrote in part in an
  accompanying post. Invoking an abbreviation for large language models and
  referring to one of Israel’s largest cities, the post continued: “The key
  takeaway? The future of cybersecurity is being written in code, and it seems a
  significant part of it is being authored in #TelAviv and powered by LLMs. An
  exciting time to be in the field!” That LinkedIn page under Alexandrovich’s
  name has since been deleted. The Israeli news outlet Ynet reported on
  Wednesday that the US had detained “an employee of the Israel National Cyber
  Directorate” for interrogation while he was representing his country at a
  professional conference. That employee then returned to his hotel and flew
  back to Israel two days later. “Israeli officials downplayed the incident,
  saying it carried ‘no political implications’ and was resolved quickly,” Ynet
  reported, without naming Alexandrovich or mentioning he had been arrested in
  connection with a felony charge leveled against him by Nevada law enforcement
  officials. “The reasons for the questioning remain unclear but may relate to
  the employee’s conduct.” Ynet reported early on Saturday evening US eastern
  time that Alexandrovich was on leave from the Cyber Directorate by “mutual
  decision”. The outlet also said that the Cyber Directorate claimed the earlier
  information about Alexandrovich was “accurate based” on what had been provided
  to the agency. Mediaite reported that Netanyahu’s office issued a statement
  denying that the employee in question had even been arrested. “A state
  employee who traveled to the US for professional matters was questioned by
  American authorities during his stay,” the prime minister’s office said. “The
  employee, who does not hold a diplomatic visa, was not arrested and returned
  to Israel as scheduled.” Nevada’s internet crime against children taskforce
  helmed the operation which resulted in the arrests of Alexandrovich and seven
  other men in the city of Henderson, which is near Las Vegas. All of the
  suspects believed they were meeting minors when undercover officers instead
  confronted and arrested them, police said. The arrested men were all brought
  to jail after being taken into custody, said the statement from the Las Vegas
  metropolitan police department, which participated in the operation alongside
  local, state and federal law enforcement officials. Among the other suspects
  was Las Vegas Redemption church pastor Neal Harrison Creecy, 46, the local CBS
  affiliate reported. A church official told the station that Creecy resigned
  shortly after being released from jail on a $10,000 bond. Under Nevada law,
  luring a child with a computer for a sex act can carry between one and 10
  years in prison.
