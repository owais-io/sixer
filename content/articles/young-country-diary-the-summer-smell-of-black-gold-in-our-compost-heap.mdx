  The fresh “forest floor” smell filled my nostrils as Mum twisted the lid off
  the compost bin. “Get a lungful,” she said, sticking her head over it and
  encouraging me to do so. It smelled fantastic – magical almost – raw nature
  broken down into dark, crumbly, nutrient rich compost; not pungent and wet
  like in winter. We call it our black gold. We’ve been taking turns to stir it
  all year, rain or shine, mixing our compost “soup”. We add layers of kitchen
  waste – greens and browns – fruit skins, vegetable peelings and cardboard
  tubes. We chop them up so they break down more easily. We water our heap when
  it feels dry, with the rainwater that collects in our water butt and rolls
  down the drainpipe from Dad’s shed. Compost contains bacteria known as
  Mycobacterium vaccae and apparently inhaling or absorbing these bacteria
  stimulates serotonin production in the brain, making us feel happy and
  relaxed. And that’s exactly how we felt, Mum and me. We grabbed a handful of
  compost each and let it crumble through our fingers. We marvelled at the life
  that had made a home there. Our friends the woodlice, worms, slugs and snails
  that had come to their calling, to do their duty in the circle of life –
  eating, digesting and expelling black gold. Springtails sprinkled the soil
  like glitter, and we watched as millipedes and beetles darted in and out of
  the decayed detritus. They’re doing an excellent job, as are we – teamwork!
