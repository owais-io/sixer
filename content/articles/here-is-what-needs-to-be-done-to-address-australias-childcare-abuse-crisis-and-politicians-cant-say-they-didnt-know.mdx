  On Friday, state education ministers will meet Jason Clare to discuss the
  thorny and critically important issues facing the country’s childcare sector.
  There could not be a more significant moment for the conversations that we are
  having about the safety of the more than 1 million Australian children who
  attend childcare. Except for the last most significant moment. And the one
  before that. Because this – tragically – is not the first time there has been
  a government meeting or report or a major review into childcare policy after
  horrifying allegations of serial abuse of children in childcare. Review after
  review has made recommendations to the government – about record-keeping,
  oversight, regulation, funding – that have sat, for years, gathering dust on
  government shelves. After charges were laid against Ashley Paul Griffith, who
  was found guilty last year of abusing 73 girls while working in childcare in
  Brisbane and Italy over two decades, Clare commissioned a review. It made
  recommendations about how to monitor childcare workers who exhibit concerning
  behaviour, and even those who have serious reports of child abuse made against
  them to police but who aren’t convicted. These recommendations still have not
  been implemented. Last year, the Productivity Commission handed down a
  comprehensive report into the childcare sector, which included recommendations
  related to standards and safety, including that an independent national
  commissioner for early childhood be established and that regulators be given
  additional funding so they could conduct more frequent inspections. Many of
  these recommendations still have not been implemented. Before that, there were
  recommendations handed down in 2015 after the royal commission into the
  institutional abuse of children, which included a call to have a national
  working with children’s check, a recommendation that sat in the too-hard
  basket for a full decade until last week, when the attorney general announced
  there would be a national working with children check (WWCC), of sorts, by the
  end of the year. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In light of this, it is
  imperative that Friday’s meeting produces real solutions that are actually
  implemented. Here is what the government has indicated will be on the table. A
  national register of childcare workers This idea has been mentioned a number
  of times by Clare since the arrest of a Melbourne childcare worker, who has
  been charged with sexually abusing eight children in his care, was announced
  in July. Parents across Victoria were subjected to the horrific experience of
  getting a “drip feed” of information about where the alleged offender had
  worked, said Clare, as police were forced to pore over the records at
  individual centres to find out if, and when, the alleged offender had been
  there. “This highlights … why you need a database or a register, so you know
  where all childcare workers are and where they’re moving from centre to
  centre,” Clare said. I don’t know anyone who would disagree. But, if this is
  all the national register does – tell us who has worked where and when – then
  its utility is extremely limited. A more useful register is one that would
  allow centre directors, the regulator, even police, to create a record of “red
  flag” behaviour, logging when someone has been fired for cause, or for
  allegedly grooming a child; or of times someone has been reported to the
  police for alleged child abuse, even if the police have not been able to lay
  charges, so that people looking to employ a childcare worker can know the
  history of the person they are dealing with. Last week, Det Sup Linda Howlett,
  the head of the New South Wales police child sexual abuse squad, threw her
  support behind a “red flag” register, saying it would likely help police
  identify and apprehend potential offenders much earlier. “At the end of the
  day, the offenders that we’ve actually charged, and a number of them are quite
  high profile, have never had a criminal history,” she said. Obviously this
  would be tricky to do. Obviously there are privacy concerns and legal issues
  to be sorted. Our society operates on the fundamental principle of people
  being innocent until proven guilty; we don’t want a system where one false and
  malicious accusation can ruin a person’s career and life. However, we also
  don’t want a situation like the one we find ourselves in now, where the
  concern for the privacy or reputation of the adult so dramatically trumps the
  safety of the child. Such a system could have made an enormous difference in
  preventing some of the offending of Griffith. Before he was investigated and
  arrested, more than one complaint was made about Griffith to his employers,
  the Early Childhood Regulatory Authority and the Queensland police, including
  at least one of sexual abuse against a child in his care. The earliest of
  these reports to police was made more than a decade before he was eventually
  arrested. Nationalising working with children checks This was a recommendation
  presented to the government in 2015. The attorney general, Michelle Rowland,
  acknowledged last week that the fact it had taken 10 years to implement was a
  “failure of successive governments”. However, Rowland acknowledged governments
  wouldn’t be standardising the criteria that led to someone’s WWCC to be
  revoked across the states. Instead they would implement a system that meant
  someone banned from working with children in one state wouldn’t be able to
  keep their WWCC in another state. Firstly, let it sink in that that hasn’t
  been the policy until now. It is great that a “banned in one, banned in all”
  policy will be introduced by the end of the year. But this is a bare minimum.
  It should happen, but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s the answer. In the
  case of Griffith, at the time of his arrest, he didn’t have a criminal
  conviction and still had a valid WWCC. A national WWCC system would have made
  no difference in preventing his offending. What could have played a role is if
  the bar for cancelling someone’s WWCC was lowered, so that it considered
  repeated reports to police alleging sexual abuse as a reason to cancel
  someone’s right to work with kids. A review of the Victorian childcare system,
  released on Wednesday, recommended precisely this – that a worker’s WWCC could
  be suspended or refused when there were “credible allegations or patterns of
  concerning behaviour with children”. It will be interesting to see how much
  traction this suggestion gets at the national table on Friday. Pulling funding
  from underperforming centres After huge community outrage after the recent
  Victorian allegations, one of the first things the federal government
  announced it would do was to introduce legislation that would allow it to pull
  funding from centres that repeatedly failed to meet national safety standards.
  The government introduced this in the first week of the new parliament and it
  has already put about 30 childcare centres on notice that they need to pick up
  their game or face a funding freeze. We have seen enough reports of
  poor-performing centres, where children are kept in unsafe or neglectful
  circumstances, to know that this is a good change. And while it will help to
  address the centres that operate so poorly that children are in danger, it’s
  not a policy that will necessarily help with the other issue at the front of
  mind for the public – sexual abuse of children. Installing CCTV There are
  arguments in favour of this. Howlett told a parliamentary inquiry last week
  that CCTV has been instrumental in some prosecutions of childcare workers, who
  would have escaped justice without that evidence. However, there are valid
  concerns about introducing this surveillance into childcare centres, including
  hacking, the safe storage of footage and who is allowed to access and view it.
  Implementing CCTV safely will cost money, with Goodstart, one of the largest
  not-for-profit childcare providers, saying the “installation costs of secure
  systems are in the tens of thousands of dollars per centre”. So, that’s one to
  watch closely at Friday’s meeting – if CCTV is mandated, it must come with
  adequate funding to be implemented safely, or we are opening up a whole new
  dangerous can of worms. None of us watching this unfold think their task is an
  easy one, but it’s far too important a task for them to look for easy wins.
