  Angela Rayner is battling for her political survival after she admitted
  underpaying stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat and referred herself to
  the ministerial ethics adviser after days of denials of wrongdoing. The deputy
  prime minister confirmed her tax arrangements after coming under intense
  pressure to be more transparent about her properties, but has been left with
  her reputation damaged and future hanging in the balance. Keir Starmer
  immediately threw his weight behind Rayner, but faced criticism after Downing
  Street refused to say when he had been told about her situation. Government
  sources suggested the ethics inquiry could be completed within days. The
  controversy comes as the prime minister faces a turbulent autumn, with tax
  rises expected to be announced in the 26 November budget, which will arrive
  against a difficult economic backdrop. Rayner, who is also the housing
  secretary, has faced charges of hypocrisy as tax rises could include those on
  property. She has also previously called for wealth taxes to help ease the
  UK’s strained public finances, including targeting people who used companies
  to avoid stamp duty. After referring herself to the ethics adviser, Sir Laurie
  Magnus, Rayner said she had received inaccurate legal advice that led her to
  underpay stamp duty. She confirmed she will have to pay more as a result of
  incorrectly paying the lower rate on the flat in Hove, East Sussex. Experts
  have said the bill could run to as much as an extra £40,000. In a highly
  personal statement to the Guardian, she said she “deeply regretted” that the
  error had been made, after classifying the flat as her only property, despite
  spending much of her time with her children at the family house in
  Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. Rayner’s fate, as deputy prime minister
  and as a cabinet minister, could come down to whether she can prove that she
  was given the wrong advice by her lawyers, as she has claimed, when she bought
  the Hove flat in May. In an early sign of support for Rayner, Starmer told MPs
  he was “very proud to sit alongside” her in the Commons. The prime minister,
  who patted her shoulder when he arrived for PMQs, said referring herself was
  the “right thing to do”. “She has explained her personal circumstances in
  detail. She has gone over and above in setting out the details, including
  asking the court to lift a confidentiality order in relation to her own son,”
  he added. “I know from speaking at length to the deputy prime minister just
  how difficult that decision was for her and her family, but she did it. She
  did it to ensure that all information is in the public domain.” But his
  spokesperson refused to say when Rayner received new advice that she had
  underpaid. No 10 also declined to confirm when Starmer was told. As recently
  as Monday, he said she was the victim of “people briefing against her and
  talking her down over and over again”. Starmer has a track record of
  ruthlessness when it comes to firing errant ministers, but while Rayner faces
  a moment of great uncertainty, she could yet be protected by her relatively
  powerful position within the Labour party, as a standard bearer of the left
  and working-class voice. Months before the purchase of her Hove flat, Rayner
  had put her stake in her constituency home in Ashton into a trust, which was
  originally set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who, after a
  “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby, had been left
  with lifelong disabilities. In May 2025, when she bought the south coast
  property, she said she was advised by lawyers over the level of stamp duty
  required. Subsequently, tax experts had told her that the flat could not be
  treated as her only residence because of the provisions of the trust. Tax
  experts say that, even though she gave up her financial stake in the Ashton
  house after her divorce, Rayner would be regarded as still owning it if she or
  her children were a beneficiary under the trust and entitled to occupy the
  dwelling for life. As the flat was an additional dwelling, she would be
  expected to pay the higher stamp duty rate of £70,000, rather than the £30,000
  she actually paid. She is now working with HM Revenue and Customs to establish
  exactly how much extra tax is owed. Regardless of ownership, the Ashton
  property remains her family home and where she is registered for most official
  and financial purposes, including council tax and the electoral roll. It is
  where her children live full-time, while she and her former husband take turns
  living at the house. In her statement, Rayner said: “When purchasing the
  property, my understanding, on advice from lawyers, was that my circumstances
  meant I was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty. “However, given the
  recent allegations in the press, I have subsequently sought further advice
  from a leading tax counsel to review that position and to ensure I am fully
  compliant with all tax provisions. “I have now been advised that although I
  did not own any other property at the time of the purchase, the application of
  complex deeming provisions which relate to my son’s trust gives rise to
  additional stamp duty liabilities. “I acknowledge that due to my reliance on
  advice from lawyers which did not properly take account of these provisions, I
  did not pay the appropriate stamp duty at the time of the purchase. I am
  working with expert lawyers and with HMRC to resolve the matter and pay what
  is due”. While Starmer awaits the ethics adviser’s conclusions, he will face
  pressure over Rayner’s position. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader,
  said: “If he had a backbone he would sack her.” The Tories published multiple
  old tweets from Rayner in opposition decrying “one rule for them, one rule for
  everybody else”. The Reform UK deputy leader, Richard Tice, said: “She was so
  vocal in attacking opposing politicians when she was in opposition that she
  can’t stand up and say: ‘I’m the biggest hypocrite in the land.’ She has to
  offer her resignation.” However, Rayner received unexpected support from Ed
  Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, who refused to join the chorus of critics
  calling for her to go. “Obviously if the ethics adviser says Angela Rayner has
  broken the rules, her position may well become untenable,” he said. “But as a
  parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is
  our son’s care after we have gone, so I can completely understand and trust
  that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here.” In her
  statement, Rayner added: “While I do not find it easy to publicly discuss
  personal and sometimes distressing family matters, I have always taken my
  responsibility as an MP and deputy prime minister seriously and tried to be as
  open as possible while protecting my family. “To address the allegations made
  against me, I have now taken the difficult decision to explain why my
  arrangements are as they are.” Downing Street had revealed on Monday that
  Rayner was prevented from publicising all of the details about her property
  ownership by a court order. In the interests of transparency, she applied to
  the court and was given permission to discuss them publicly on Tuesday night.
