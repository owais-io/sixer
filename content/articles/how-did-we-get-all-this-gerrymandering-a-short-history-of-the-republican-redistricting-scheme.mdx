  The gerrymandering wars are back. Perhaps they never really went away. Extreme
  GOP gerrymanders have remade American politics over the last 15 years. They
  have locked Republicans into office in state legislatures nationwide, even in
  purple states when Democratic candidates win more votes. They have delivered a
  reliable and enduring edge to the GOP in the race for Congress. Perhaps most
  importantly, they have entrenched hard-right lawmakers and insulated them from
  the ballot box, allowing them to enact conservative policies on reproductive
  rights and public education that are rejected by majorities of voters. Now
  Texas Republicans, spurred by Donald Trump, have readied a brazen mid-decade
  power grab that would award them as many as five additional seats in Congress.
  This would be a dramatic boost heading into the midterms, since the GOP only
  holds a three-seat majority. California has threatened to retaliate with a
  mid-decade redraw of its own. Other blue state governors are talking tough as
  well. But Republicans have more targets. They won’t stop in Texas. They will
  probably redraw Ohio, Missouri, Indiana and Florida as well. How did we get
  here? How did gerrymandered lines, rather than voters, gain the power to
  determine winners and losers? *** While politicians have gerrymandered since
  the dawn of the American experiment – even before it got its name from then
  Massachusetts governor Eldridge Gerry’s party crafting state senate districts
  around Boston that looked like salamanders – the modern story really begins in
  2008 with the election of Barack Obama and a blue wave that delivered
  Democrats trifecta power and even a US Senate supermajority. On television
  that election night, even the sharpest Republican analysts spoke of
  unbreakable emerging coalitions and demographic changes that could provide
  Democrats with majorities for a generation. It didn’t exactly work that way. A
  handful of savvy Republican strategists recognized that while 2008 may have
  been historic, 2010 could be much more consequential. It would be a census
  year. And after every census, the nation redistricts every state legislature
  and US House seat. A lightbulb went off at the Republican state leadership
  committee (RSLC). Executive director Chris Jankowski recognized the
  opportunity first: target states where the legislature controls redistricting.
  Pour millions into underfunded state legislative races. Drown Democratic
  incumbents. Flip as many chambers as possible. Redraw the lines. If
  Republicans could pull it off, they would go from demographically challenged
  to the catbird seat for a decade. “We should do this,” Jankowski remembered,
  in an interview for my book Ratf**ked. “I think we can get millions – and you
  don’t have to do anything other than what you were going to do anyway.” They
  called this Redmap, short for the Redistricting Majority Project. It
  transformed the nation. Karl Rove laid out the plan in a March 2010 Wall
  Street Journal op-ed that laid out the specific small towns in Indiana,
  Pennsylvania and Ohio where national Republicans would come gunning for
  small-town Democrats. His message: control redistricting, control Congress.
  “Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these
  seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190
  congressional seats.” Despite Rove’s announcement, Democrats never saw it
  coming. The 2010 Tea Party wave placed all those seats and more in the GOP
  column. Republicans took over in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina,
  Indiana, Alabama, Wisconsin and Ohio, among others, adding them to trifecta
  control in states like Texas and Florida. The following year, the RSLC paid
  master GOP mapmaker Thomas Hofeller to draw new lines in crucial states. New
  computer mapping software and voluminous new voter data turned redistricting
  into a video game. Republicans won, voters lost. It all paid off with a high
  score in 2012. Obama won re-election by a slightly smaller margin than 2008,
  but Democrats added seats in the US Senate. Republicans, thanks to their new
  lines, held the House and it wasn’t close. They won 234 seats to the
  Democrats’ 201 – even though Democrats won 1.4m more votes nationwide. Or look
  at the impact this way. Obama carried Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania,
  Wisconsin and Michigan. Republicans drew congressional lines in those states
  and won 64 of 94 seats. *** The modern, technologically enhanced gerrymanders
  held throughout 2014 and 2016. Even when Democratic candidates won more votes,
  they could not budge the state legislature in Michigan, for example, or an
  astounding 13-5 edge in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation. This futility
  and frustration at the ballot box turned into a national grassroots campaign
  to end gerrymandering. In 2018, grassroots movements in Ohio, Michigan,
  Missouri, Utah and Colorado established citizen commissions or other
  nonpartisan processes to draw lines. Meanwhile, the same technology that
  allowed partisans to crack and pack voters with such precision also allowed
  data scientists and courts to see through extreme gerrymanders. Voters and
  public interest law firms won new maps in states including Florida (ahead of
  2016) and Pennsylvania (2018), and won lower-court decisions in Ohio,
  Michigan, Maryland, North Carolina and Wisconsin that struck down extreme
  maps. This helped Democrats take back the House in 2018 without actually
  defeating the gerrymander: almost three-quarters of the seats they won were
  drawn by commissions or courts, or arose from new maps won via litigation. In
  states such as Wisconsin, the gerrymanders held strong: in 2018, Democrats
  swept the US Senate, governor’s offices in every statewide race and 53% of the
  state assembly vote. Republicans won 64% of the seats with just 45% of the
  vote. Polls showed that huge majorities of voters across party lines despised
  gerrymandering. Reform efforts won in red states and in blue states with big
  majorities. And in federal courts, judges appointed by presidents of both
  parties believed that they had all the tools they needed to strike down maps
  that decimated true political competition, and took aim at the radical
  outliers drawn by both parties. Reformers and voters had real momentum. ***
  Enter John Roberts. In 2019, the chief justice – whose antipathy to voting
  rights has been central to his life’s work ever since he arrived in Washington
  in 1982 as a young aide in Reagan’s Department of Justice – destroyed hopes
  that the federal courts would help defend voters and create a national
  standard. In a case from North Carolina called Rucho v Common Cause, a 5-4
  majority ruled that partisan gerrymandering was a nonjusticiable political
  issue. The decision, written by Roberts, closed the federal courts to future
  claims at the precise moment that they’d become the most important part of the
  solution. After all, politicians have long proven unwilling to reform the very
  process that elected them and helped entrench them in office. Roberts,
  however, said the federal courts could no longer be involved, because there
  was no clear and manageable standard. Multiple federal judges, of course,
  pointed to multiple clear standards. And even if Roberts didn’t find a
  standard to his liking, nothing required him to leap to making the issue
  nonjusticiable. The decision signed the death warrant for reform. Without the
  threat of a national, court-enforced standard, states had no reason to behave
  themselves. In 2021, Democrats – now fully awakened to the problem – claimed
  seats in Illinois (14 of 17) and Maryland (seven of eight) and took extra
  seats in Oregon, Nevada and New Mexico. Republicans, already enjoying an edge,
  claimed four in Florida then worked the margins in Texas, Tennessee, Indiana,
  Oklahoma, Georgia and Utah. According to the nonpartisan Brennan Center, the
  GOP had a 16-seat advantage this decade thanks to gerrymandering. While some
  suggested that the national congressional map had become much more balanced,
  this is misleading: any balance in the national map arrived because many more
  state maps had been gerrymandered, harming more voters, everywhere. Both
  parties knew increasingly partisan state courts were unlikely to block
  partisan power plays. In New York, a Democratic court allowed Democrats to
  remake the map before 2024. In North Carolina, the state supreme court upended
  a fair map and reversed a year-old decision banning partisan gerrymandering as
  soon as they took partisan control. Given free rein, the GOP drew themselves
  three extra seats and a 10-3 advantage. Those three seats, by the way, match
  the margin of the GOP House majority. That’s the power of one state map. The
  absence of any federal deterrence also encouraged state lawmakers to defy
  courts, commissions and state constitutions. In Ohio, lawmakers stiff-armed
  the state supreme court when it attempted to enforce anti-gerrymandering
  provisions enacted decisively by 75% of voters in a 2018 initiative. In
  Arizona, Republicans gamed the independent commission by stacking the
  commission that selects the supposedly nonpartisan chair who controls the
  tie-breaking vote. Utah simply ignored the 2018 vote establishing a
  nonpartisan commission. They all got away with it. *** Which brings us to the
  current moment. Trump kickstarted this new redistricting arms race when he
  demanded that Texas flip Democratic seats to the GOP. California and New York
  have talked tough about suspending their commissions and retaliating with
  gerrymanders of their own. That’s a long and complicated road, however:
  California voters would need to agree this fall. New York’s constitution
  couldn’t be amended before the 2028 cycle. Meanwhile, Democrats have few other
  likely targets, and Republicans look likely to continue their push into Ohio,
  Missouri, Indiana and Florida – and even Kansas, Kentucky and New Hampshire,
  if they choose. Frustrated Democrats have few appealing options. Such are the
  ongoing consequences of falling asleep 15 years ago and failing to counter
  Redmap. It has done precisely what the Republicans said it would do – with
  greater success and a longer lifespan than they ever could have imagined.
