  Indian oil refineries will continue to buy oil from Russia, officials have
  said, before threatened US sanctions next week against Moscow’s trading
  partners over the war in Ukraine. Media reports on Friday had suggested India,
  a big energy importer, would stop buying cheap Russian oil. Trump later told
  reporters that such a move would be “a good step” if true. “I understand that
  India is no longer going to be buying oil from Russia,” he said. “That’s what
  I heard. I don’t know if that’s right or not. That is a good step. We will see
  what happens.” However, official sources in India, quoted by the news agency
  ANI, rebutted Trump’s claim, saying Indian oil companies had not paused
  Russian imports and that supply decisions were based on “price, grade of
  crude, inventories, logistics and other economic factors”. Trump’s remarks
  came a day after the White House announced tariffs of 25% on all Indian goods,
  along with a penalty for buying arms and energy from Russia amid the war in
  Ukraine. Trump has given an 8 August deadline for Vladimir Putin to stop the
  war or risk further sanctions on tariffs on countries that import Russian oil.
  Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Indian state-owned refineries had
  suspended Russian oil purchases amid the tariff threats and narrowing price
  discounts. But on Saturday, the New York Times cited two unnamed senior Indian
  officials who said there had been no change in Indian government policy
  related to importing Russian oil. One said the government had “not given any
  direction to oil companies” to cease buying oil from Russia. “These are
  long-term oil contracts,” one of the sources said. “It is not so simple to
  just stop buying overnight.” The sources cited by ANI said Indian oil
  refineries operated in full compliance with international norms, and that
  Russian oil had never been directly sanctioned by the US or EU. “Instead, it
  was subjected to a G7-EU price-cap mechanism designed to limit revenue while
  ensuring global supplies continued to flow.” They added: “India’s purchases
  have remained fully legitimate and within the framework of international
  norms.” The sources also noted that if India had not “absorbed discounted
  Russian crude combined with Opec+ production cuts of 5.8 mb/d [millions of
  barrels a day], global oil prices could have surged well beyond the March 2022
  peak of US$137/bbl [a barrel], intensifying inflationary pressures worldwide”.
  Russia is the top oil supplier to India, responsible for about 35% of the
  country’s supplies. India says that as a major energy importer it must find
  the cheapest supplies to protect its population against rising costs. On
  Friday, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said: “We look
  at what is available in the markets, what is on offer, and also what is the
  prevailing global situation or circumstances.” Jaiswal added that India had a
  “steady and time-tested partnership” with Russia. This partnership has been a
  point of contention for the White House, with Trump posting on Truth Social on
  30 July that while India was “our friend”, it had always bought most of its
  military equipment from Russia and was “Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY,
  along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN
  UKRAINE – ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!” In a second post, Trump added: “I don’t care
  what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together,
  for all I care.” Ukraine’s military said on Saturday it had hit oil facilities
  inside Russia, including a refinery in Ryazan, causing a fire on its premises.
  The strike also hit an oil storage facility, a military airfield for drones
  and an electronics factory.
