  Carmakers claimed that leaving electric car sales rules unchanged would
  threaten British jobs and cost them hundreds of millions of pounds, according
  to documents that show the private lobbying for a slower transition away from
  fossil fuels. BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Toyota claimed that rules
  forcing them to sell more electric cars each year would harm investment in the
  UK, according to responses to proposed changes submitted to the government.
  The responses were obtained by Fast Charge, a newsletter covering electric
  cars, and shared with the Guardian. JLR, the Land Rover maker, said leaving
  the rules unchanged would “materially damage UK producers’ ability to invest
  in vehicle lines”. The last Conservative government said last year that
  automotive manufacturers must sell an increasing proportion of electric cars
  each year, or else face steep fines, under rules known as the zero emission
  vehicle (ZEV) mandate. Electric car sales have increased rapidly, accounting
  for more than a fifth of the market in July, and every carmaker complied with
  targets last year. However, carmakers earlier overestimated the demand for
  battery vehicles, meaning they have been forced to cut prices to attract
  buyers. Lower prices are good for consumers, but the industry has argued they
  are unsustainable. After intensive lobbying, the Labour government backed down
  in April, adding new “flexibilities” to rules that will allow carmakers to
  sell more petrol cars. The consultation responses reveal the detailed
  arguments that carmakers made in private in favour of leniency, despite advice
  from the government’s official climate adviser that the changes could raise UK
  carbon emissions. The German manufacturer BMW said the UK had become worse for
  manufacturing since Brexit, but added that the ZEV mandate was “much more
  radical and far-reaching” than the equivalent rules in the EU or California.
  BMW, which makes Mini and Rolls-Royce cars in Britain, wrote: “The UK has
  already become a far more difficult place to produce vehicles now post-Brexit,
  and a further challenging market environment could ultimately damage
  competitiveness and have a detrimental effect on the 8,000 jobs – up to 50,000
  with supply chain – we currently retain in the UK.” Japan’s Toyota, which runs
  factories in Derbyshire and north Wales, said “penalties could amount to
  hundreds of millions of pounds for individual manufacturers, a level that
  could place employment and investment across the industry at risk.” The
  world’s biggest carmaker by volume has focused on hybrid cars, combining a
  smaller battery and a petrol engine, and has lobbied successfully for hybrid
  sales to be allowed until 2035 in the UK. Its Japanese rival Nissan, whose
  sole European factory is in Sunderland, said carmakers needed more
  flexibilities or else face “critical levels” of costs that would divert money
  “away from battery EV research and development in the UK”. JLR, which has the
  most British factories, complained that a rule that allowed carmakers to buy
  “credits” from rivals whose electric car sales were above target meant that
  British companies were subsidising rivals particularly in China, which
  dominates electric car production. However, campaigners counter that the rules
  worked by forcing carmakers to go electric. Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of
  New Automotive, a group advocating the switch to electric vehicles, said: “The
  car industry’s own consultation responses confirm that the ZEV mandate’s 2024
  targets were met, proving the policy is a powerful driver of change. “The
  focus should now shift to accelerating the transition, as this data shows the
  UK automotive industry is capable of delivering cheaper, cleaner transport.”
  Tom Riley, the author of the Fast Charge newsletter, said: “Carmakers love to
  wave the union jack when it suits them, but threatening UK jobs and investment
  to weaken climate policy is a cynical tactic.” Mike Hawes, the chief executive
  of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group, said:
  “The automotive industry faces unprecedented challenges, not least the shift
  to EVs against a subdued economic backdrop and fierce global competition. The
  ZEV mandate intensifies the pressure with the timescale necessitating brands
  spend billions to drive demand to achieve compliance. UK manufacturers have
  consistently warned that this cost was unsustainable and would threaten
  further investment. He said the government was right to change previous
  targets, which would have meant “decarbonisation at the cost of
  de-industrialisation”. A BMW spokesperson said the company supported UK and
  global climate targets, but added: “We believe consumers will ultimately
  determine the pace of transition to ZEVs, as mandates do not create demand.” A
  Nissan spokesperson said: “We welcome the government’s pragmatic approach to
  lower-than-anticipated EV take-up, including the introduction of consumer
  incentives designed to bring consumer demand closer to ZEV mandate
  requirements.” JLR and Toyota declined to comment.
