  Taylor Townsend capped a whirlwind 48 hours at the US Open with one of the
  finest performances of her career, upsetting No 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2
  under the lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium to reach the fourth round in New York
  for the first time since 2019 and equal her best performance at any major. The
  29-year-old American, ranked outside the top 100 in singles but world No 1 in
  doubles, steadied herself after a nervy start and won four of five games to
  take the opening set. She then took complete control after getting broken
  early in the second, continuing to rush the net and ride the energy of a
  raucous crowd to win the last six games on the trot and close out a
  straight-sets win in 76 minutes. It was third career win over of a top-10
  opponent, along with victories over Simona Halep here in 2019 and Jessica
  Pegula in Rome last year. A former world No 1 junior from Georgia who
  reinvented herself as a doubles star, she won 21 of 29 points when she came
  forward and struck nearly four times as many winners (23) as Andreeva (six).
  “God damn, this feels so good,” she said afterwards. “Welcome to the show.”
  Townsend has become one of the tournament’s central figures since her
  second-round win over Jelena Ostapenko, after which she revealed that the
  Latvian told her she had “no class” and “no education”. The comments, which
  Ostapenko justified as a reaction to Townsend not apologizing for a shot that
  clipped the net cord, prompted accusations of racism. “I also want to say
  thank you to everyone who supported me over these last 48 hours,” Townsend
  told the Ashe crowd. “It’s bigger than me. It’s about the message, it’s about
  the representation, it’s about being bold and being able to show up as
  yourself and I did that tonight. You guys saw the real Taylor Townsend
  tonight.” Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka were among those who publicly came to
  Townsend’s defense over the past two days, with Osaka calling Ostapenko’s
  alleged comment “one of the worst things you can say to a Black tennis player
  in a majority-white sport”. After Friday’s triumph, Townsend said handling the
  fallout was easier than some might think. “It hasn’t been hard at all,” she
  said. “I said to my team, I’m made for this type of stuff. It wasn’t hard,
  because I stood in my truth. I didn’t have to defend anything that I said.
  What I said, I said, and I meant. “When it’s time to do the job, it’s time to
  do the job. And that’s what I think is a testament to being professional,
  being able to block out what’s on the outside and when you step in the lines
  you handle business.” The Ostapenko controversy also tapped into a deeper
  history. In 2012 the USTA asked Townsend, then 16 and the world’s top junior,
  to sit out the US Open girls’ event and denied her wild cards into the main
  draw or qualifying because of concerns over her fitness. The move, condemned
  by Serena Williams, Martina Navratilova and Lindsay Davenport, forced her
  mother to pay her way and ultimately led Townsend to leave the federation’s
  program to work with Zina Garrison. That the same player once deemed “not
  ready” for Ashe could return years later to topple one of the sport’s
  prodigies on the biggest stage spoke to the depth of her resilience. Already a
  Wimbledon and Australian Open doubles champion alongside Katerina Siniakova,
  Townsend proved on Friday she still has the power to make her mark in singles.
  Townsend said the night felt worlds away from her breakthrough win over Halep
  six years earlier on the same stage. “In 2019 I felt like I was climbing and
  trying to get over the hump ... it helped validate me as a player,” she said.
  “This time it just feels completely different. I wasn’t searching for
  anything, I wasn’t looking, trying to find answers. I had all the answers in
  here.” For Andreeva, an 18-year-old who for years has been earmarked as a
  future slam winner, the defeat brought an end to a season of consistency at
  the biggest tournaments, where she had reached the second week at each of the
  first three majors of the year, including the quarter-finals at Roland Garros
  and Wimbledon. The Russian, who claimed WTA 1000 titles at Dubai and Indian
  Wells earlier in 2025 and reached a career-high ranking of No 5, was simply
  outplayed in the end as Townsend fed off the Ashe crowd and her confidence
  mounted. Townsend will next face the unseeded Czech Barbora Krejcikova, who
  upset 10th seed Emma Navarro in three sets earlier Friday, for a place in the
  last eight. For a longtime fan favorite whose Instagram following has roughly
  doubled over the past week, it will offer her widest audience yet. “This is
  some people’s first time finding out who Taylor Townsend is,” she said.
  “People being able to see me now, but then being able to go back and follow my
  journey and figure out how I got here, I think that’s super cool. I’m just
  truly showing up as myself, and I think people see that and I think it’s cool
  they like what I see. I think I’m pretty cool. I think I’m funny. I think
  that’s all that matters.” Not long after Townsend completed her match, fourth
  seed Taylor Fritz ground out a 7-6 (3), 6-7 (11), 6-4, 6-4 victory over Swiss
  qualifier Jerome Kym next door on Armstrong, salvaging what had been a brutal
  day for the American men. Earlier, sixth seed Ben Shelton and 17th seed
  Frances Tiafoe were both eliminated within an hour of each other, leaving
  Fritz and Tommy Paul as the only US men left standing in singles. Paul, the No
  14 seed, will face Kazakhstan’s 23rd seed Alexander Bublik on Saturday on
  Ashe.
