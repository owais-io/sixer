  With net zero policies under attack from elected far-right populists as well
  as autocratic petrostates, and another summer of record-breaking temperatures
  in Europe, the failure to decarbonise the world’s power supply is as gravely
  concerning as ever. But the UN secretary general, António Guterres, struck an
  optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the
  cusp of a new era … The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to
  falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price
  shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres
  are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon
  electricity by 2030. Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to
  renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand
  action from US businesses at this point. In Scotland earlier this week, Mr
  Trump launched his latest misleading tirade, urging European leaders to “stop
  the windmills”. His repeated attacks on wind power, as well as the recent
  cancellation of billions of dollars of green energy investment, make Mr Trump
  a destructive outlier. But populist parties in other countries are also
  ramping up their opposition to climate goals. In the UK, such positions were
  once confined to the political fringe. Now, the Conservative leader, Kemi
  Badenoch, is a net zero sceptic who has floated the possibility of a future
  government quitting the Paris agreement, while her acting shadow energy
  secretary, Andrew Bowie, accused the UN’s most senior climate scientists of
  bias. This disturbing shift rightly provoked a strong response from the
  government. In July Ed Miliband called out Ms Badenoch’s party for its
  irresponsible and anti-science stance. With the UN’s deadline for countries to
  present their climate plans (known as nationally determined contributions)
  coming up, Mr Miliband deserves praise for his commitment. Climate diplomacy
  depends on politicians having the courage to face down opponents – and
  convince the public that a safe and secure energy future is within reach. This
  is the prospect held up by Mr Guterres, who hopes it will galvanise
  much-needed action. The goal, agreed two years ago, of tripling global
  renewable energy capacity by 2030, is nowhere near being reached. With the UN
  climate summit nearing, all eyes are on China – the key player in the global
  renewables boom and the fight to stay within climate limits. Internationally,
  and domestically, renewables are the right choice. Colonial rule saw Carbon
  Brief rank the UK as the world’s fourth-largest historical emitter, behind
  only the US, China and Russia. To keep UK public support strong for green
  policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure a well-planned
  green transition to bring down prices. Grids need upgrades to handle wind
  turbine growth. Supply chain bottlenecks and concerns about human rights in
  critical minerals mining must be addressed. In Britain, proposals from Labour
  MPs to reform energy billing – cutting costs for low-income households that
  use less power – aren’t just about lowering inflation. They raise a deeper
  question of fairness, and deserve serious attention as a step toward a more
  equal energy system, potentially through a social tariff. Ultimately, reforms
  should cut gas’s sway over electricity prices and couple optimism on
  renewables with honesty about the challenges. Do you have an opinion on the
