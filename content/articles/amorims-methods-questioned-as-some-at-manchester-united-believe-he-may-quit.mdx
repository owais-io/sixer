  Ruben Amorim’s tactics and man-management are being questioned by some in the
  Manchester United dressing room and there is a feeling at the club that the
  head coach may resign unless results pick up. Amorim is under severe pressure
  after the Carabao Cup penalty shootout elimination by Grimsby, the first time
  United have lost to a fourth-tier team in the competition. The reverse means
  the side are without a victory this season, having also lost to Arsenal and
  drawn with Fulham in the league, putting pressure on them before their home
  game with Burnley on Saturday. United are understood to have no plans to sack
  Amorim but there is a sense at the club that if results do not turn his
  stubbornness may prompt him to walk away – possibly as early as next week
  during the international break – rather than change his methods. After last
  season’s record low Premier League finish of 15th, the poor run is sparking
  questions of Amorim from within the squad, the Guardian understands. The head
  coach’s insistence on a 3-4-3 formation is causing particular scrutiny after
  earning 27 points in 29 league matches. There is also bemusement regarding his
  man-management approach, which is viewed by many players as well-meaning but
  sometimes counter-productive. After the Grimsby loss Amorim said “something
  has to change” but he is viewed at United as being wedded to his formation, so
  there is no expectation that was a reference to altering the shape he also
  used consistently – and successfully – at Sporting in his previous job. Jason
  Wilcox, the director of football, is thought to be aware of the problems
  regarding Amorim’s tactics and handling of his players and may move to address
  these. Amorim also said after the Grimsby match: “Let’s focus on the next game
  and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things
  through.” United’s match with Burnley is their last before the international
  break. The message from within Old Trafford on Thursday was that it remained
  business as usual. United resume after the break with the derby at Manchester
  City on 14 September. One player who will not feature again for United is
  Alejandro Garnacho. The winger – one of the players Amorim was keen to move on
  – appears likely to move to Chelsea. The two clubs have finally agreed a £40m
  deal with a 10% sell-on fee.
