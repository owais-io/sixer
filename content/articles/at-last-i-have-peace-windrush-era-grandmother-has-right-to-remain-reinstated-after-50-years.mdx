  reinstated after 50 years

  “It will be nice to have a rest at last,” said Comfort Olufunmilayo Olawo, who
  has spent the last 50 years commuting between the UK and Nigeria. After
  racking up around 300,000 air miles and spending thousands of pounds on
  flights and visa fees, the 82-year-old Windrush-generation grandmother who
  originally settled in the UK almost 60 years ago has finally been granted
  permission to stay here. Olawo first arrived in the UK in 1966 and in December
  of that year married Emmanuel Layiwola Olawo, a quantity surveyor, at a
  ceremony in Islington, north London. Both were granted indefinite leave to
  remain in the UK. She had several jobs in London, including one at the
  Institute of Mechanical Engineers where she worked as a typist. “I was a very
  good typist and I loved my job,” she said. The couple had two children who
  were born in London, but when she became pregnant with their third child she
  decided to return to Nigeria to give birth so that she could get support from
  her extended family there. She took the older two children with her and
  planned to return to London with them after the birth. But by the time she was
  ready to return permanently to London to rejoin her husband, more than two
  years had passed. According to the immigration rules, anyone who has
  indefinite leave to remain but is out of the UK for more than two years loses
  their right to remain. The only legal option available to her from that point
  onwards was to apply for an annual six-month visitor visa every year and
  commute between her husband in London and her extended family in Nigeria. She
  abided by these immigration rules scrupulously and did not overstay her
  visitor visas. Almost all of her family, which includes five children and 10
  grandchildren, live in the UK. The previous government introduced a returning
  resident visa, for which her lawyer successfully applie, finally offering a
  legal alternative to the increasingly exhausting annual commute. At the age of
  82 she no longer needs to travel between continents every six months. “My
  children were getting worried that I was too old to go back and forth, back
  and forth all the time. I’ve spent 50 years running up and down between here
  and Nigeria. I belong to the UK and at last I have peace,” she said. Olawo’s
  daughter June Alawode welcomed the Home Office’s decision to grant her mother
  indefinite leave to remain for a second time. “This is very good news. It has
  not been easy for my mum to go backwards and forwards between here and Nigeria
  for 50 years. Getting the visa and air ticket every year was challenging. My
  mum is an amazing person but all of this has taken a toll on her. Dad died
  three years ago. Now it’s time for my mum to relax and enjoy the rest of her
  days. As children we went backwards and forwards to Nigeria with my mum. My
  childhood was between two countries and I just had to accept that.” Naga
  Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, representing Olawo, said: “Our client, now 82, has
  finally been granted permanent settlement in the UK and reunited with her
  British-born children after more than 50 years of separation caused by
  inflexible immigration rules and administrative failure.” Kandiah added: “Now
  finally settled, her story highlights the enduring harm caused by historical
  immigration injustice and the need for a more humane system.”
