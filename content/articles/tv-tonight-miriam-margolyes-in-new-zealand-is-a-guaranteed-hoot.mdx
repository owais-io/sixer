  Miriam Margolyes Discovers New Zealand 9pm, BBC Two After her great series
  exploring Australia, Miriam Margolyes is now in New Zealand, shooting a film
  in which she plays a nun. She invites the cameras to follow her as she asks
  how being a New Zealander is different from being Australian. (“I haven’t got
  a flying fart of an idea.”) Any show with Margolyes is a guaranteed hoot and
  serves up wisdom, too. Hollie Richardson Beethoven’s Ninth at the Proms 8pm,
  BBC Four Beethoven’s Symphony No 9 was a joyful statement written as the
  composer was going deaf. It backends a Prom that also features Bent Sørensen’s
  Evening Land, about childhood memories in Denmark, and Anna Clyne’s The Years,
  inspired by lockdown isolation. HR Under the Bridge 9pm, ITV1 The 1990s
  Canada-set true-crime drama ends in a dramatic courtroom showdown this week.
  Teenagers Kelly (Izzy G) and Warren (Javon Walton) are finally standing trial
  for the murder of a bullied 14-year-old, as Rebecca (Riley Keough) and Cam
  (Lily Gladstone) look on in mounting horror. Ellen E Jones First Dates 10pm,
  Channel 4 Caitlin is making a play for children’s entertainer Michael, who
  harbours a sincere side under his giant mascot costume. Meanwhile, erotic
  fiction writer Immogen is searching for a romantic plot twist, and Elleigha,
  the naked cleaner, is ready to make a clean sweep. Ali Catterall Peacemaker
  10pm, Sky Max John Cena returns as the hulking hero so devoted to peace he
  doesn’t care who he kills to achieve it. But even after saving the world in
  season one, Peacemaker is still viewed as a liability, much to his dismay. The
  mix of puerile humour and ultraviolence may be divisive but Cena plays the
  self-delusional manchild to the hilt. Graeme Virtue Chappell Roan @ Reading
  Festival 2025 10.40pm, BBC One Pop’s biggest star du jour Chappell Roan and
  Irish balladeer Hozier are Friday night’s headliners at this year’s Berkshire
  bash, with Bloc Party and the Kooks before them. This highlights package will
  bring the best bits. HR Film choice The Surfer, (Lorcan Finnegan, 2024),
  7.25am, 12.35pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Lorcan Finnegan’s sunburnt
  psychological thriller is an electrifying throwback to Australian cinema’s new
  wave of the 70s and its studies in toxic masculinity. Nicolas Cage is almost
  too perfectly cast as “the Surfer”, a father hoping to introduce his teenage
  son to his childhood seaside home and ride some waves. However, a gang of
  larrikins led by Julian McMahon’s smug Scally deem Luna Bay a locals-only
  venue – and will do anything to stop his attempts to surf there. This brightly
  lit but darkly menacing film grows increasingly hallucinatory and nightmarish
  as the Surfer is stripped of his money, phone, food, car, even his board. And
  Cage on the edge is, as always, a magnetic watch. Simon Wardell Live sport
  Women’s rugby World Cup: England v USA, 6.30pm, BBC One Zoe Aldcroft leads the
  host nation’s opening match at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. Premier
  League football: West Ham v Chelsea, 7pm, Sky Sports Main Event At the London
  Stadium.
