  Kanpur: 1857 review – a British imperial atrocity retold down the barrel of a
  cannon

  When it comes to cruel and unusual punishment, it is hard to think of anything
  more grizzly than that meted out by the British army in Kanpur (then
  anglicised as Cawnpore) in retribution for the 19th-century Indian uprising
  against colonial occupation. Having been rounded up, each ringleader was tied
  to the mouth of a cannon. Before the eyes of the public, the weapon was fired.
  To emphasise the point, a cannon sits on stage in Kanpur: 1857 – surely the
  largest prop at the fringe – positioned threateningly behind Niall Moorjani,
  who plays a storyteller facing their final hour, trying to come up with a
  narrative that makes sense of their awful predicament. How did someone who
  grew up peacefully on the banks of the Ganges, who was captivated by poetry
  and the beauty of the spoken word, end up in this situation? Didn’t their
  fellow rebel forces have the good grace to free their captured enemies and
  return their weapons? They sees themself as a good person caught up in the
  harsh tide of history. Moorjani, a storyteller, is a still and compelling
  narrator, whose performance is enhanced by the live tabla playing of Sodhi
  (Hardeep Deerhe), sitting meditatively by their side. They are joined by
  Jonathan Oldfield as the British army executioner, whose membership of a
  Scottish regiment (posh southern accent notwithstanding) serves as a reminder
  that Scotland was as gung-ho a part of the British empire as England. The
  soldier is intrigued by their captive’s tale, but on too much of a power kick
  to be empathic. The character’s presence in and out of the audience gives the
  performance a lively dynamic, although not quite enough to create a
  full-fledged play. The production sits in limbo between storytelling and
  drama, even as it remains a shameful and important reminder of a neglected
  period of British history. • At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24
  August. • All our Edinburgh festival reviews • This article was amended on 1
  August 2025 to correct some personal information.
