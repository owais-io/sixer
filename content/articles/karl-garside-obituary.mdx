  My friend Karl Garside, who has died aged 59 of heart disease, was an Animal
  Liberation Front (ALF) activist, hunt saboteur and animal rights investigator.
  Across four decades of direct action he was involved in more operations
  claimed by the ALF than any other individual, making him Britain’s most
  prolific ALF activist. Karl was born in Birkenhead in Merseyside to Sheila
  (nee Morton), an office worker, and David Garside, an electrician. The family
  settled in Altrincham in Cheshire in the mid-1970s, where Karl went to
  Wellington Road school. In 1983, aged 17, he bunked off South Trafford College
  in Altrincham to take part in an invasion of the Grand National at Aintree
  racecourse. By the mid-80s Karl had joined the Northern Animal Liberation
  League and Manchester Hunt Sabs. Ahead of a major 1984 raid, he posed as a job
  applicant to case ICI’s Alderley Edge laboratories, which were later stormed
  by 300 activists. On that occasion the goal was not to rescue animals but to
  document and expose the extent of animal experimentation. In August that year
  he also took part in a daylight raid on Unilever’s research facility in
  Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, with similar aims. The action led to the conviction
  of 25 people, and Karl served eight months in prison for conspiracy to burgle
  and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. Despite being jailed, he remained
  deeply involved in direct action throughout the 80s, 90s and noughties,
  playing a key role in campaigns against Consort kennels in Hereford, where he
  freed a number of beagles, at Shamrock farm in West Sussex, which was the UK’s
  only commercial primate importation and quarantine centre, and Hillgrove farm
  in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories. He later played a key role
  in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign, which targeted the Huntingdon
  Life Sciences animal testing laboratory in Cambridgeshire and became one of
  the largest anti-vivisection efforts in British history. Most of his activity
  for the campaign was clandestine, trying to pressure the company and disrupt
  its relationships with suppliers. He also took part in the Surrey Anti-Hunt
  Campaign, sabotaging countless fox hunts by calling the hounds off or getting
  between the fox and the hounds. In 2014 he founded the Hunt Investigation
  Team, which went on to expose cruelty at hunts, farms and abattoirs across
  Britain. His investigative work featured on ITV News and on the BBC, and in
  the Guardian and the Independent. Shortly before his death he had become an
  investigator for the League Against Cruel Sports. In the later part of his
  life, Karl was a full-time freelance animal rights investigator, including for
  Tracks Investigations. In the years before that, he worked variously as a
  firefighter, an electrician and a nurse. He is survived by a daughter and two
  granddaughters.
