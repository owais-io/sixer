  “I’m a children’s illustrator working on books, including the lovely Welcome
  to Our … series, which looks at how children live around the world. I’m also a
  part-time graphic designer with Cambridge University Press. Mainly I work from
  home but I go into the office once a week. It’s not far from where I live in
  Cambridge. My day changes depending on the project. I start about 7:30am with
  my morning routine and skincare. Working from home gives me more flexibility
  but it can make me a bit lazy, skipping some steps. I don’t do makeup because
  it’s quite rare to have video calls. I have started to use retinols in the
  evening though so I need more sunscreen because of the extra sensitivity they
  cause. On my office days, I put in more effort. I’ve got dry skin so when I
  wear makeup I try to make the base really hydrated, otherwise I get quite red
  later on. I’m Korean and there’s the popular Korean beauty trend – the seven
  skin method – that involves applying a hydrating toner seven times so your
  skincare products are better absorbed. I don’t have time to do seven layers so
  I do three!” Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme Dr Ejikeme says: “Harriet’s approach to
  layering hydration is thoughtful, but the persistent redness suggests her skin
  barrier is under some stress, likely from a combination of environmental
  changes and dry indoor conditions. A barrier-first strategy is key. Start with
  Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Essence Toner with niacinamide and ginseng,
  which gives the skin essential hydration and helps balance tone and texture.
  Follow this with Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Hydrating Serum with
  niacinamide and ashwagandha. This simple pairing mimics the benefits of the
  ‘seven skin’ method with fewer layers, helping Harriet maintain hydration
  without the time commitment or risk of product overload.” “My home workspace
  is a desk in my bedroom. I have two monitors and lots of illustrations and
  pictures on the wall. It’s a corner full of colourful artwork, which makes me
  happy. Most of my work is done digitally, so I spend a lot of time at this
  desk. I use the downstairs dining table when I need more space, especially
  during the initial sketch phase, because I still like to work with pen and
  paper for that part. I start work around 9am, after dropping my son off at
  school. I’m not really a morning person – it takes me a long time to warm up,
  so I use that time for admin and image research. Then I’ll do some light
  sketching to warm up my hands and get some layout ideas. By that time, the
  morning’s normally gone. My husband, who’s a software engineer, works from
  home as well, so we usually have lunch together and then take a short walk for
  a proper break. Even though I try to remember to drink water during my working
  day, I’m really bad at doing it. I’m sitting down, so I don’t feel like I need
  it. I have quite dry skin anyway, so it often feels tight and dehydrated.” Dr
  Ejikeme says: “Harriet’s low water intake combined with indoor heating or
  cooling leads to transepidermal water loss [evaporation from the skin].
  Harriet needs both hydration and barrier support. To achieve this, I’d
  recommend Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Hydrating Serum with niacinamide
  and ashwagandha.” “The afternoon is my focus time. I put on music or a podcast
  and then I just draw for three to four hours without stopping. It’s hard to
  get into the flow, but once you’re in it you don’t want it to end. Some days
  I’ll need to draw for 10 hours if I have a pressing deadline, but that’s not
  often. ‘I always double cleanse in the evening’ Because I sit for such long
  periods, I think my skin looks really tired, especially around the eyes, and
  I’ve noticed more dark circles and puffiness there in the morning. I’m not
  sure if it’s my lifestyle or something else, but my hyperpigmentation is
  worse. I’ve heard it’s because of the blue light from screens.” Dr Ejikeme
  says: “Harriet’s long hours in front of multiple screens can contribute to
  tiredness around the eyes and worsening pigmentation. This is common in people
  who spend extended periods in front of screens. For the eye area, Modern
  Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening Eye Cream with vitamin C and caffeine is
  highly effective; it brightens, reduces puffiness and hydrates without feeling
  greasy. To address pigmentation, using a stable vitamin C serum such as
  Chemistry Glow 10% Vitamin C Serum With Ferulic Acid is a smart addition to
  Harriet’s routine. This will help reduce the appearance of dark spots and
  brighten overall tone.” ‘Creating these images brings me real joy’ “Around 4
  or 5pm, I stop work to spend time with my son, make dinner and help with
  homework. Then after he’s gone to bed, I might do some editing on a personal
  project – a picture book I’m writing. I’ll also check Instagram to see what
  others are doing. Before bed, I do some cardio exercises for 20 minutes and
  then shower. I always double cleanse in the evening, and I apply a hyaluronic
  acid essence twice, to try to hydrate my skin. Twice a week, I mix a 0.5%
  retinol with my moisturiser and if I’ve had a stressful day, I’ll pop on a
  sheet mask for 15 minutes before bed. I’ve been drawing ever since I was
  young, I always loved it. I think it’s how I tackle the world around me and
  express my feelings. Creating these images brings me real joy. Most of my
  personal work starts with random ideas and then the characters start coming to
  life. Someone once described my illustration style as ‘friendly yet stylish’
  and I quite like that. Working on the Welcome to Our … series was special
  because I got to draw children from many different cultures all around the
  world. It’s incredibly meaningful to be able to share the message of diversity
  through my illustration. I feel so grateful that it could help make the world
  a little more welcoming and open.” Harriet’s Modern Chemistry formula Dr
  Ejikeme’s summary: “Harriet’s skin is responding to the demands of her
  environment, long hours in front of screens, low water intake and the drying
  effects of central heating. Though she’s already applying hydration in layers,
  her persistent dryness and sensitivity suggest a compromised barrier. A gentle
  yet effective routine that combines targeted hydration, antioxidant support,
  and consistent barrier repair will help rebalance her skin. With the right
  products, including lightweight hydrating essences and calming serums, her
  skin can remain resilient and radiant even through long creative sessions and
  screen time.” AM routine Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening Eye Cream

  Restore Hydrating Serum Double cleanse: start with an oil-based cleanser to
