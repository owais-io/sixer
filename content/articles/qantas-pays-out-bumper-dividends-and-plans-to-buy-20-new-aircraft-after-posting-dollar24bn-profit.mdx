  Qantas has paid out bumper dividends to shareholders and announced it would
  buy 20 new aircraft after its before-tax profits rose by $300m to $2.4bn in
  the year to June Australia’s biggest airline expanded its profit margin after
  holding ticket prices steady while fuel costs eased, its annual results showed
  on Thursday. Investors bid up the company’s share prices in early trading,
  sending its market value up 8% to a record $18bn, double the capitalisation it
  enjoyed a year prior. The airline paid compensation and penalties of $210m
  after the federal court found it illegally sacked workers. Its net profits
  still rose by a third to $1.6bn, even after accounting for tax, legal expenses
  and other one-offs. Underlying earnings across the group rose more than $200m
  to $2.6bn, with budget alternative Jetstar narrowing the gap between its
  contribution and that of Qantas domestic flights for the third year in a row.
  Earnings held at $1bn for Qantas domestic but rose from about $500m to $769m
  at Jetstar as it brought new planes into service and attracted growing numbers
  of customers in the year to June, two-thirds of whom paid $100 or more for
  their flight according to the company. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  group held ticket prices steady in 2024-25, with ticketed passenger revenue
  and ticket sales both rising by about 7%, reaching nearly $17bn from 56m
  tickets. Costs fell for the second year in a row as fuel prices slipped,
  meaning air fares surged relative to the price of jet fuel, confirming
  analysis from the competition watchdog earlier in August. Lower costs boosted
  the group’s operating margin over the year to 11.1%, up from 10.4%, with
  Jetstar growing its margin for the third year in a row to 13.7%, or as high as
  16% for domestic flights, the company report showed. The exit of Tiger
  Airways, Bonza and Rex had boosted the smaller player’s activity, Jetstar’s
  chief executive, Stephanie Tully, told investors on Wednesday. Qantas’ group
  chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, said the group dominated two-thirds of
  Australia’s airline market and customer demand would continue to rise as
  business travel approached pre-pandemic levels. “Zoom and Teams meeting have
  not ended the need for face-to-face business meeting,” she said. Qantas’
  frequent flyer loyalty program also delivered underlying earnings of over
  $550m – a 9% increase – after attracting a rising number of customers, who
  earned 222bn frequent flyer points but redeemed only 185bn of them over the
  year. The surge in before-tax profits to $2.4bn saw the company announce $400m
  in dividends for shareholders, on top of the $400m payout awarded in February,
  which was the company’s first dividend payment since 2019. Qantas also
  announced it would buy 20 new Airbus A321XLR planes to support the group’s
  363-strong fleet as it retires its Boeing 737s, which the report warned would
  increase costs in the coming year. Qantas has also criticised the Albanese
  government’s “same job, same pay” laws, which it said added $65m more in
  labour costs in 2024-25, a figure set to rise to $115m for the year 2025-26.
  Net profit rises despite legal costs The airline also saw increased costs on
  legal provisioning, which rose by $65m and a further $20m as Qantas prepared
  to pay penalties for illegally sacking ground staff. The federal court in 2024
  ordered Qantas to spend $120m compensating affected workers and then in August
  fined it $90m to deter other businesses from taking similar action, with
  Justice Michael Lee finding the airline was “the wrong kind of sorry”. Hudson
  told reporters the company had learned lessons from the findings and
  apologised to the former staff. “I am genuinely sorry for the impact that
  losing their job and the subsequent five-year legal process has had on them
  and their families,” she said. “I won’t for a second pretend that the job is
  done, far from it, but the culture … will continue to change for the better.”
  The Transport Workers’ Union was awarded $50m of that fine but Lee is yet to
  determine how much of the remaining $40m of the fine should go to the union or
  the sacked employees. “I’m just trying to work out a fair way of doing this to
  get it to the people who need it most with minimum cost,” Lee told a hearing
  on Wednesday. “These people will be in radically different positions … There
  will be people who are working next week and someone whose life has been
  completely destroyed.” The penalty determination will return to court in
  September.
