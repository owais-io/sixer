  New South Wales is heading for a sodden Saturday, with the wet and wintry
  weather that has been plaguing the east coast expected to ramp up over the
  weekend. After a week of intermittent showers, the bulk of the rain was
  forecast to hit on the weekend as a low-pressure system deepened off the
  coast, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. “The rain, which we’ve seen
  over the past few days for eastern Australia, will be greatly amplified,” said
  senior meteorologist Angus Hines. “That’s going to mean a very, very wet
  weekend.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email On Friday, a large chunk of
  sandstone cliff at Bronte beach, in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, dislodged and
  fell onto the sand after several days of rain, with NSW lifeguards warning
  locals to stay clear of the area. Heading into Saturday, the weather system
  was expected to home in on NSW, with severe weather warnings issued for
  damaging winds and heavy rainfall for central eastern parts of the state. Much
  of the NSW coastline could receive falls of between 50 to 100mm over the
  weekend, Hines said, with the heaviest falls expected for the coast and ranges
  between the Hunter and mid north coast. Some places could even see “a serious
  amount” – more than 150mm. The NSW State Emergency Service urged residents in
  coastal areas to prepare for the risk of flash flooding and renewed river
  rises, along with potential storm damage with damaging wind gusts of about
  90km/h likely. Assistant commissioner Nicole Hogan said there were simple
  things people could do to reduce the risk, such as clearing gutters and
  downpipes, trimming trees and tying down loose items. Flood watches had
  already been issued for rivers between Newcastle and Coffs Harbour, some of
  which could spill, causing minor or moderate flooding. “We would also like to
  remind everyone to never, under any circumstance, drive through flood water,”
  she said. “If you come across a flooded road, stop, turn around and find an
  alternative route.” While less than half of the amount of rainfall that fell
  in May was expected over the weekend, the ground was already “pretty
  waterlogged” and it would not take much to get the rivers going, Hines said.
  At higher elevations, snow was “definitely possible” on Saturday morning, he
  said. Flurries in the central and northern tablelands of NSW were likely, and
  there was even an “outside chance” of snow in the Granite Belt of Queensland.
  On Saturday and Sunday, large seas with swells reaching up to 5.5 metres could
  be generated across much of the Tasman Sea, according to Weatherzone. Across
  the capitals, Sydney would be dreary, grey and wet, while the weather was
  predicted to be breezy in Brisbane and chilly in Canberra. Pleasant, settled
  and sunny weather was forecast for Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide, and typical
  mid-dry season high temperatures in Darwin. Meanwhile, a weather system
  arriving in the west would deliver rain, wind and cold conditions to Perth.
  Weekend forecast: Sydney: Rain. Saturday max 18C. Sunday max 19C. Melbourne:
  Mostly cloudy on Saturday, max 15C. Sunday, mostly sunny, max 18C. Brisbane:
  Shower or two. Saturday max 19C. Sunday max 21C. Adelaide: Partly cloudy on
  Saturday, max 14C. Sunday, max 17C. Perth: Rain. Saturday, max 18C. Sunday,
  mostly sunny, max 29C. Canberra: Shower or two on Saturday, top 13C. Sunday,
  cloudy, max 15C. Hobart: Mostly sunny. Saturday 14C. Sunday max 15C. Darwin:
  Sunny. Saturday and Sunday max 31C.
