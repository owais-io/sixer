  Reform UK has engaged in a war of words with the Church of England over the
  party’s plans to deport all asylum seekers who arrive in small boats, after
  the church’s most senior bishop called the proposal “isolationist, short-term
  [and] kneejerk”. Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader, hit back against the
  archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, on Sunday, accusing him of interfering
  in domestic politics. This week Nigel Farage, Reform’s leader, announced the
  party’s migration policy, under which Britain would leave the European
  convention on human rights (ECHR) and deport people who arrive or have
  recently arrived by small boat from France. Cottrell told Sky News’s Trevor
  Phillips: “We should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short-term,
  kneejerk – in this case, ‘send them home’. Mr Farage is saying the things he’s
  saying but he is not offering any long-term solution to the big issues which
  are convulsing our world, which lead to this.” Responding on the same show,
  Tice rejected the criticism and urged the bishop, who is the acting head of
  the church while it searches for a new archbishop of Canterbury, to stay out
  of migration policy. Asked which of Cottrell’s criticisms were wrong, Tice
  replied: “All of it’s wrong.” He said: “I enjoy the church, I believe in God.
  But the role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international
  migration policies.” Farage’s new asylum policy involves deporting asylum
  seekers who cross the Channel, even to countries such as Afghanistan and
  Eritrea. To do so, Reform is promising to take Britain out of the ECHR, the
  1951 refugee convention, the UN convention against torture and the Council of
  Europe anti-trafficking convention. A Reform government would then send teams
  of immigration officials into communities across the country to find people
  who have settled here after arriving as irregular migrants and deport them as
  well. The party has struggled to answer detailed questions about how the
  policy would work and how much it would cost. Farage initially said women and
  children would be detained and deported as well as men, but a day later he
  appeared to row back on that, suggesting doing so was not “part of our plan”.
  Asked by the Guardian why he had costed the proposals at £10bn when a
  thinktank had priced a similar plan by his former colleague Rupert Lowe at
  £47.5bn, Farage responded: “Zia [Yusuf, the senior Reform official] is very
  good at maths.” Reform has also talked about deploying the navy to help it
  enforce its migration plans. Asked on Sunday whether its role would be simply
  to act as observers while small boats continued to cross, Tice replied: “Yes.
  In a sense, that’s what the Border Force are currently.” Reform is looking to
  keep the pressure on the government to close asylum hotels even after a court
  ruled that ministers could continue to use the Bell hotel in Epping to house
  people whose claims had not yet been processed. Bridget Phillipson, the
  education secretary, said on Sunday that the government would look to close
  hotels in an “orderly” way by the end of the parliament. “We can’t end up with
  hundreds of people just out on the street because a hotel has closed,” she
  said. Separately, she appeared to put pressure on the prime minister and the
  chancellor to end the two-child benefit cap, which Cottrell warned was driving
  up child poverty. “I’m ashamed of the very high numbers of children growing up
  in poverty that we see in our country,” she said, adding that bringing that
  level down was “what I came into politics to do”. Asked specifically about the
  benefit cap, she said: “It’s not the only way we can lift children out of
  poverty, and of course, it does come with a big price tag. But we know that
  not acting also comes with serious consequences and impact too.”
