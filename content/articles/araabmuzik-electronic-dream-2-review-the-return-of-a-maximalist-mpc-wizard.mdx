  Could there be a better time for AraabMuzik – the Rhode Island MPC wizard also
  known as Abraham Orellana – to return with a sequel to Electronic Dream, his
  generation-defining 2011 debut? The original album was confounding and
  exhilarating in equal measure, thanks to its canny fusion of EDM rave-up
  synths and blown-out hip-hop beats. Alongside the rise of producers such as
  Clams Casino, it spoke to a post-financial crisis millennial generation
  finding much-needed euphoria in electronic maximalism. Now, gen Z-beloved
  artists such as Bladee and Nettspend are reviving an even bigger, bolder
  version of that sound, and finding huge cult audiences But perhaps that’s why
  Electronic Dream 2 – while engrossing and atmospheric, capturing AraabMuzik’s
  trademark fusion of dread and debauchery – almost feels meek. Some songs, such
  as the smeary, blushing Til You Drop, capture the hallucinatory brilliance of
  the original album. Others, such as opener 3AM and the moody Half a World
  Away, feel more like generic beat tape cuts, in part because AraabMuzik’s
  sound has been so influential that it now seems a little rote. Dubbing the
  album a sequel to Electronic Dream may have been a mistake: the grand trap
  track Reach Out is imposing and scary, building to a dense cacophony, but it
  feels out of place on a sequel to an album with such a defined sound. It’s an
  understandable impulse to make a sequel: rappers have done it for years, and
  nostalgia-bait has become a dominant form of popular art – to the point that
  Madonna has been teasing Confessions Part 2. But for an innovator such as
  AraabMuzik, moving on seems the best path.
