  some readers. It also contains references to Indigenous Australians who have
  died Malcolm McKinnon remembers poking around under Great-Uncle Bill’s big old
  house in Brisbane while the adults were having afternoon tea. Once he found a
  pile of rusty old chains. Some had big loops, one was a breastplate of some
  kind. He thought they looked strange. Malcolm’s brother Ross, 62, also
  remembers seeing the chains under Bill’s old Queenslander. “They were too big
  to be handcuffs,” Ross says, “but as kids we didn’t think about it any more
  than that.” The boys grew up hearing about how Bill had been a famous police
  officer on the frontier in the Northern Territory. “Bill was seen in the
  family as a bit of a legend,” Malcolm, now 69, says. “He was involved in the
  Petrov affair, he was active during Cyclone Tracy, he was the last cop who
  rode a camel.” Much later, they realised there was another side to the story.
  The chains had been for capturing and imprisoning Aboriginal people. By the
  neck. A fuller picture of Constable Bill McKinnon’s policing career has
  emerged – and it has been confronting, revelatory and life-changing for
  Malcolm, Ross and their youngest brother, Alistair. In 1934 McKinnon shot and
  killed an Aboriginal man named Yukun at Uluru. He told an inquiry it was
  accidental and he was exonerated but almost 80 years later it emerged – via
  the discovery of his diary – that he had indeed “fired to hit” Yukun. He is
  not the only one to have concealed his actions from scrutiny. Guardian
  Australia has uncovered the diary of a Western Australian colonist called
  Major Logue who used a Masonic code to write about the killings of at least 19
  Aboriginal people around Geraldton between 1851 and 1853. These exploits were
  written about by the colonists themselves, which makes it difficult for
  descendants and their extended families to dismiss them. Yet some still have
  concerns about publicising these records. Logue’s diaries are being prepared
  for publication but the historian who has worked on them told Guardian
  Australia the coded entries are being deliberately left out, according to the
  preference of the direct descendant who holds the originals. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email “To protect the person who holds the diaries we felt it
  was … expedient, perhaps, to not have that in writing. Everyone knows they did
  it,” Nan Broad says. “But there’s nothing in writing, and we prefer nothing to
  be in writing.” Theona Councillor, who says she and Naaguja Yamatji families
  represent the “other side of the shield”, believes truth has a way of making
  itself known. “Truth will always uncover itself,” she says. “It wants to come
  out. And that blood needs to be heard. That blood is calling out, the blood of
  my people. “It happened 170 years ago but it feels like yesterday for me. And
  the way that people are hiding their records, it feels like yesterday for them
  too, by the sounds of it.” Truth is vital for healing, she says, to allow
  Naaguja Yamatji and settler descendants to come together for the first time as
  equals and confront their bloody history with honesty. Only then can the
  scales of denial begin to fall. “Go back to the beginning, and be brave,” she
  says. “We are not a nation of weaklings. We can handle the truth.” Colonial
  silence In 2018 Guardian Australia’s series documenting the frontier violence
  of Australia’s colonial past, The Killing Times, revealed a confronting
  picture of the scale of the massacres – and the involvement of government
  forces in an overwhelming number of them. As part of that series we brought
  together families grappling with their “side” of that history, some of them
  meeting for the first time. The Descendants builds on that foundation.
  Families from over Australia are coming to terms in different ways with the
  real-life challenges of truth telling. For them, this work is real, personal
  and local. There are no guidelines. Uncovering the truth comes with the risk
  of family estrangement. It can lead to denial and indifference. It can also be
  a liberation. Some descendants of perpetrator families are challenging what
  they call “colonial silence”. In Geraldton Bruce Baskerville, a historian and
  descendant of the Criddle family who took part in the Bootenal massacre of
  1854, talks about accepting that he has an ancestor who was a “cog in the
  machinery of imperial governance” – and that he has materially benefited from
  the dispossession of others. “I know that I’m a beneficiary of all of that,”
  he says. “My life, all the food I’ve ever eaten, that’s been grown here, the
  education that I had, all of that’s all been paid for, from that. That’s how
  that wealth was created.” George Criddle, who has spent years working between
  colonist and Yamatji families to break the silence, says settler families have
  to “unlearn” their understanding of history: “There’s a lot of entrenched
  ideas about who tells the story, and there’s a lot of white families who
  believe they are the storytellers, and that their side of the truth is the
  right side.” Prof Mark McKenna, another historian, spent years investigating
  the shooting of Yukun for his book Return to Uluru. Yukun endured further
  indignity after death. The 1935 board of inquiry exhumed his remains and took
  them to Adelaide. Prompted by McKenna’s book, a forensic search was made for
  them but only Yukun’s skull could be located, in the South Australian Museum,
  in 2019. He was laid to rest in a deep, narrow grave in 2022. A small cross
  marks the spot near the Mutitjulu waterhole. Ross, Alistair and Alistair’s
  wife, Ruth, went to Uluru for the repatriation. They stood quietly to one side
  of the ceremony, unsure how they’d be received. But they were welcomed,
  literally embraced. It felt like a family funeral. “It was a privilege to be
  there,” Ross says. The brothers have met in Melbourne on a blustery winter day
  to talk about their family legacy. Alistair says their parents would have been
  proud of them for representing the McKinnons. Their parents believed in the
  importance of public service, of doing right by others. “It was incredibly
  enriching,” Alistair says. To other families who might be fearing facing up to
  the actions of their ancestors, he says: “Embrace it. Do it.” “The experience
  was so life-changing, and when we saw how much it meant to the families on the
  other side … we left welcomed, and it was so important to them, for us to be
  involved.” Ross says he’s not convinced by the argument that men like his
  uncle Bill were “of their time”. “These people did not live by the standards
  of their time either,” he says. “The actions at Uluru were not a one-off. They
  were known for being cruel. They knew what they were doing was wrong.” McKenna
  says facing the truth of colonisation means understanding it still having real
  effects on Aboriginal people today. “It’s not something that’s in the distant
  colonial past. It’s not something that is separated from us by time or by
  flesh or by country. It’s present now, and I think that’s still something that
  non-Indigenous Australians struggle to understand.” In the case of Yukun, it
  led to his remains finally being found and laid to rest. McKenna recalls
  looking at the “shelves and shelves of boxes” of Indigenous human remains
  “which literally tower over you” at the South Australian Museum. “To see
  Yukun’s remains [there] and then to watch them come back to country, and see
  hundreds of people gathered there at Mutitjulu – it’s not history,” he says.
  “It’s understanding that First Nations people have to live with this today,
  the consequences of colonisation and the consequences of all of the racist
  policies that have been mounted against them over the years.” Councillor says
  Aboriginal people are waiting for others to put down their “comfortable
  untruth” and reckon with what happened. “Answer that blood properly,” she
  says. “Give my ancestors that time, that place, that voice that needs to be.
  You can’t just brush over a quick sorry and then it’s finished. It’s just the
  beginning of a reconciliation.” • Indigenous Australians can call 13YARN on 13
