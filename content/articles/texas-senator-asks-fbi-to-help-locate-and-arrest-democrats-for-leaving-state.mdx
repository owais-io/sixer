  The US senator John Cornyn of Texas has asked the FBI to aid Texas law
  enforcement in locating and arresting Democrats who left the state to
  forestall a plan sought by Donald Trump to aggressively redraw the state’s
  congressional map in a way that could help Republicans keep their House
  majority after the 2026 midterm elections. The senator’s request is a
  significant escalation in the fast-moving showdown that could set up a
  confrontation between the blue state leaders shielding the Democratic state
  lawmakers and the Trump administration. Earlier on Tuesday, Texas Democrats
  denied a legislative quorum for the second day in a row by scattering across
  the country, with many decamping to Chicago, Illinois, where the Democratic
  governor, JB Pritzker, has vowed to protect them. In a letter to the FBI
  director, Kash Patel, Cornyn, a Republican, said “federal resources are
  necessary to locate the out-of-state Texas legislators who are potentially
  acting in violation of the law”. The FBI declined to comment on the senator’s
  request to involve its agents. Ken Paxton, the state’s Republican attorney
  general, announced what experts say is likely a longshot bid to convince a
  court to declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not
  return to work at the statehouse by Friday. “The people of Texas elected
  lawmakers, not jet-setting runaways looking for headlines,” Paxton, the
  long-embattled Trump loyalist challenging Cornyn for the Republican Senate
  nomination, said in a statement. “If you don’t show up to work, you get
  fired.” On Tuesday evening, Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott,
  announced that he had filed an emergency petition with the state supreme court
  seeking to remove from office state representative Gene Wu, chair of the House
  Democratic caucus who has sought refuge in Illinois. “Texas House Democrats
  abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences,” Abbott said
  in a statement. Responding to the governor’s petition from Chicago, Wu said it
  was both his “moral” and “constitutional” duty to “not be a willing
  participant” in Abbott’s attempt to appease Trump’s demand for more
  congressional seats. “Denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment of
  my office,” Wu said. “It was a fulfillment of my oath.” Trump, who had been
  unusually silent on the dramatic showdown that he set in motion, also weighed
  in on Tuesday. Asked by a reporter whether the FBI should assist with tracking
  down state Democratic lawmakers, the president said the agency “may have to”.
  “The governor of Texas is demanding they come back,” Trump said. “You can’t
  just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That’s what
  elections are all about.” Earlier on Tuesday, Trump argued that Republicans
  were entitled to the five additional seats they could stand to gain if the new
  map were approved. “We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats,”
  Trump said in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box. “We have a really good
  governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas. I got the highest
  vote in the history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to
  five more seats.” “In Illinois, what’s happened is terrible what they’re
  doing,” the president added. “And you notice, they go to Illinois for safety,
  but that’s all gerrymandered. California is gerrymandered. We should have many
  more seats in Congress in California. It’s all gerrymandered.” Democrats and
  Republicans have both used gerrymandering to maximize their party’s political
  power, though in recent years Republicans have been far more aggressive – and
  effective – in deploying the tactic. California voters approved an independent
  redistricting commission to draw the state’s congressional maps for the first
  time in 2010. But the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has vowed to “fight
  fire with fire” by asking voters to override the commission and approve new
  maps that would favor California Democrats if Texas moved forward with its
  gerrymandering plan. At a press conference on Monday, Newsom said he hoped
  Texas Republicans would retreat, but that California would not hesitate to
  respond in a way that carried “profound national implications” for the balance
  of power in Washington. At a news conference in Illinois, Texas Democrats were
  joined by Pritzker, who hailed them as “heroes”, and the Democratic National
  Committee chair, Ken Martin, who accused Republicans of attempting to “steal
  their way to victory”. Pritzker has also said that Illinois may respond to
  Texas’s efforts by redrawing its own map in Democrats’ favor, given that
  “everything has to be on the table”. “Trump came up with a new scheme to rig
  the system by ramming through a corrupt, mid-decade redistricting plan that
  would steal five congressional seats, silencing millions of voters, especially
  Black and Latino voters,” the governor said. The Texas house reconvened at 1pm
  local time on Tuesday, but enough Democrats were still outside the state to
  deny quorum for a second day. “There being 94 members present, quorum is not
  present,” said the Texas house speaker, Dustin Burrows, a Republican. He added
  that state troopers were “actively working to compel their attendance after I
  signed their civil arrest warrants yesterday”. Burrows said the chamber would
  reconvene and attempt to reach quorum again on Friday. Gina Hinojosa, a
  Democratic state representative who left Texas for Illinois on Sunday, said
  that she and her colleagues planned to be absent from the state capitol for
  “as long as it takes” to thwart the Republicans’ redistricting plans. The
  current special legislative session, called by the Texas governor, lasts until
  19 August. Abbott could continue to call additional special sessions, and it’s
  not clear how long Democrats could stay outside the state. Each lawmaker who
  has absconded faces a $500-per-day fine, and Abbott has ordered the Texas
  department of public safety to “locate, arrest and return to the House chamber
  any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans”. Hinojosa shrugged off
  Republicans’ threats to remove Democratic members from office, calling it
  “disrespectful” to the Texans who elected them, many of whom, she said, have
  expressed “nothing but gratitude” to the lawmakers standing up to Trump.
  Though she lamented the redistricting “arms race” that the Texas undertaking
  had triggered – with Democratic states vowing to respond in kind – Hinojosa
  said it was imperative that her party confront the “real, present-day threats”
  posed by redrawn congressional maps. “Democrats need to fight to win,” she
  said. “We fight to win for the day, and we take tomorrow as it comes.” Yet
  breaking quorum is a time-honored minority party tactic in Texas. During a
  contentious mid-decade redistricting battle in 2003, Democrats fled the state
  in an attempt to prevent Republicans from approving a new congressional map.
  Eventually, enough members returned to Austin, and the map was adopted. “The
  thing that’s new now is the sense that there is no other recourse,” said
  Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los
  Angeles whose expertise is in redistricting. He pointed to the 2019 supreme
  court decision, in which the justices ruled that federal courts were powerless
  to hear challenges to partisan gerrymandering. Meanwhile, the
  Republican-controlled Congress has shown no appetite for defying Trump, even
  if some Republican members are beginning to fear his gambit in Texas could
  backfire politically. While partisan redistricting is not illegal under the US
  constitution, Levitt said many voters, and especially Democrats, are furious
  over what Barack Obama has called a “power grab” by Trump and Texas
  Republicans. “In any society, when people see a breakdown in the rule of law
  and no opportunity for accountability, they tend to turn to self-help,” Levitt
  said.“It’s not good … but a zone where politics is used not to build but to
  punish is not a positive development for American democracy.”
