  A military vehicle crashed into a car in Washington DC on Wednesday morning,
  an incident that comes as six Republican-led states have all pledged to send
  more national guard troops to DC. The city’s local CBS station first reported
  on the accident, which happened in Washington’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, and
  cited confirmation from the DC fire and emergency services. On social media,
  the department said that one person was extricated and transported with “minor
  injuries”. A Reddit user posted a video of the collision’s aftermath – showing
  a Humvee-style vehicle and a shattered silver SUV. A military affairs reporter
  for the Washington Post noted on X that according to the national guard, “one
  of the vehicles in this accident was an M-ATV, an armored tactical vehicle
  with a V-shaped hull designed to deflect roadside bombs. They have commonly
  been used in war zones for years, and weigh about 14 tons each.” The DC fire
  department and the national guard did not immediately respond to the
  Guardian’s requests for comment and further details on the crash. The incident
  comes as Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, South Carolina and West
  Virginia have all pledged to send at least 1,200 national guard troops to DC,
  to assist the president’s crackdown on “bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor” in the
  nation’s capital, despite a falling crime rate.
