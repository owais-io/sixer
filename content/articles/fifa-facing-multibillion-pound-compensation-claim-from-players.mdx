  Fifa is facing a multibillion-pound claim for compensation from a group of
  current and former players after last year’s ruling by the European court of
  justice (CJEU) that its transfer rules are unlawful. The Justice for Players
  foundation, a Dutch group that has the former England assistant manager Franco
  Baldini on its board, has served notice of its intention to file a class
  action against Fifa and the football associations of France, Germany, the
  Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Justice for Players is seeking compensation
  on behalf of players who have lost income because of Fifa’s transfer rules
  since 2002. It says the legal case will involve about 100,000 players. The
  claim will be filed in the district court of Midden Nederland, with the
  Netherlands chosen as the jurisdiction because Dutch law permits claims from
  anyone who has worked within the European Union and the United Kingdom. The
  Football Association is understood to have been sent a copy of the letter
  before action. Although not named as a defendant, it could be added later.
  Fifa and the five domestic FAs have been given until September to respond. The
  compensation claim is the result of the CJEU judgment last October in the case
  brought by former Chelsea and France midfielder Lassana Diarra, who sued Fifa
  after the world governing body refused to issue him with an international
  transfer certificate (ITC) to join the Belgian club Charleroi in 2016 after he
  was found to have breached his contract with Lokomotiv Moscow two years
  earlier. Fifa fined Diarra €10.5m and suspended him from football for 15
  months for breaching his contract, in a ruling upheld on appeal at the court
  of arbitration for sport. After blocking his registration at Charleroi, Fifa
  was then hit with a counterclaim from Diarra, with the CJEU ruling that its
  transfer regulations were unlawful. The CJEU found that the Fifa regulations
  on the status and transfer of players infringed EU competition law and the
  right to free movement of workers. Fifa has amended its transfer regulations,
  although the new rules have not been accepted by the international players’
  union, Fifpro. The Justice for Players foundation is understood to have been
  set up this year with the intention of bringing a mass legal action. Diarra’s
  lawyer, Jean-Louis Dupont, who won the landmark case at the CJEU on behalf of
  Jean-Marc Bosman that established the principle of free movement for players
  out of contract, in 1995, is advising Justice for Players. The legal letter
  sent to Fifa makes reference to the class action being a multibillion claim.
  This figure is understood to be based on independent analysis from economists
  at Compass Lexecon, who have estimated that players would have earned about 8%
  more over their careers since 2002 had Fifa’s transfer regulations not been
  unlawfully restrictive. The CJEU judgment ruled that Fifa’s regulations
  restricted free movement by establishing unlawful criteria for determining
  compensation to be paid by a player who breaks their contract, allowing the
  national federation of the former club to withhold a player’s ITC, making the
  player’s new club liable for the compensation to be paid to the former club
  and allowing Fifa to impose disciplinary sanctions on the player and their new
  club. Fifa has been contacted for comment.
