  Nevada sheriffs are asking the public’s help in identifying a man killed on
  Saturday in an apparent homicide at the Burning Man festival. In a statement
  on Monday, Pershing county sheriff Jerry Allen asked for assistance to
  identify the man, who was found dead in the futurist encampment of Black Rock
  City as the festival reaching its climax when an effigy – the eponymous
  burning man – was set alight. “We are specifically looking to identify the
  white male adult decedent who is between the ages of 35 and 40, approximately
  6 feet tall and 200 lbs, with short brown hair and facial hair,” Allen said in
  a statement reported by the Reno Gazette Journal. The sheriff’s office are
  looking for any information from people who heard or saw anything between 8
  and 9.30pm. “We are also currently seeking information regarding any suspect
  identifiers for any person who would commit such a heinous crime against
  another human being,” Allen said. “At this time, no information is too small
  to disregard, so do not hesitate to contact my office.” A murder investigation
  was launched on Sunday after a man was found “lying in a pool of blood” on
  Saturday night, police said. That came after a festival-goer alerted a police
  officer that a man was found “lying on the ground, obviously deceased”. Part
  of the site was cordoned off as on-site police began investigating. Organizers
  with the Burning Man Project said it was cooperating with law enforcement. In
  a statement, Burning Man officials asked those still on the playa not to
  interfere with law enforcement. “The safety and well-being of our community
  are paramount,” Burning Man said. Sheriff Allen said “several participants in
  the immediate area” were interviewed. “Although this act appears to be a
  singular crime, all participants should always be vigilant of their
  surroundings and acquaintances,” Allen warned. “There is no further
  information available at this time but it will be released as appropriate to
  provide for communication, while still preserving the integrity of the
  complicated investigation of a crime in a city which will be gone by the
  middle of the week,” he added. Burning Man has become the site of unexpected
  attention in recent years. In 2023, it was washed out by strong rain storm
  that turned the desert to mud, killing one person; this year, a dust storm
  tore temporary structures away, including one named the “orgy dome”. The
  festival has previously experienced deaths, including when a man ran into the
  fire in 2017. Last week, Burning Man co-founder John Law made a rude gesture
  when he was asked to describe the festival, saying it had strayed far from its
  late stage counter-culture origins in the 1980s. “We were going to go out to
  the Black Rock Desert to just go crazy, and, you know, drive 100 miles an hour
  with the lights out, set bonfires and go up to the hot springs. We didn’t plan
  on bringing any art with us,” Law said. But he broke with the festival in 1996
  when it grew large and more commercialized. “It’s a giant party for rich white
  people,” Law told SF Gate. “They’re selling the idea of freedom, and it’s not
  free. The whole philosophy, it’s a bunch of crap.” He added that the festival
  now demands conformity. “The star f–kers started coming around. It’s as clubby
  in its own way as the Elks or some hunting lodge in Minnesota.”
