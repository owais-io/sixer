  At least 20 people are missing following violent protests that have gripped
  cities across Indonesia over the past week, a human rights group has warned.
  Mass protests first erupted on 25 August, prompted by anger over the perks and
  benefits given to lawmakers, including a controversial housing allowance.
  Public fury escalated further when a motorcycle taxi driver, 21-year-old Affan
  Kurniawan, was run over by a police vehicle at a protest site. At least six
  people have been killed since the protests began, while 20 people remain
  missing, according to a statement released by the Commission for the
  Disappeared and Victims of Violence (KontraS). “Based on public reports
  submitted to KontraS ... as of September 1, there were 23 reports of missing
  persons. After the search and verification process, 20 missing persons remain
  unfound,” KontraS said. The group said the 20 were reported missing in the
  cities of Bandung, Depok and the administrative cities of Central Jakarta,
  East Jakarta and North Jakarta that make up the wider capital city, with one
  incident taking place in an “unknown location”. On Monday, hundreds gathered
  again outside parliament in Jakarta, where increased security measures were in
  place. Police set up checkpoints across the capital, while officers and the
  military conducted city patrols and deployed snipers in key locations. Schools
  and universities in Jakarta have switched to online classes until at least
  Tuesday, and civil servants have been asked to work from home. President
  Prabowo Subianto said on Sunday night he had ordered the military and police
  to take firm action in response to the burning and looting of some
  politicians’ homes and state buildings. Protests at parliament in Jakarta
  ended in the evening, though larger protests, and clashes, were reported
  elsewhere, including in Gorontalo city on Sulawesi island – where police fired
  teargas and water cannon – and in Bandung on the main island Java, where
  protesters hurled molotov cocktails and firecrackers at the provincial council
  building, according to Agence France-Presse. Thousands also rallied in
  Palembang on Sumatra island and hundreds gathered separately in Banjarmasin on
  Borneo island, Yogyakarta on Java, and Makassar on Sulawesi, according to AFP
  journalists. The United Nations on Monday called for an investigation into
  alleged use of disproportionate force in the protests. “All security forces,
  including the military when deployed in a law enforcement capacity, must
  comply with the basic principles on the use of force and firearms by law
  enforcement officials,” said UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina
  Shamdasani. Prabowo has promised an investigation into Kurniawan’s killing,
  and pledged to help his family. Seven officers have been detained for further
  investigation. On Monday, Agus Wijayanto, head of the accountability bureau at
  the national police, told reporters an investigation had found criminal acts
  committed by two officers – the driver of the van and the officer next to him.
  They “could be dishonourably discharged”, Agus said. The protests prompted a
  rare concession from Prabowo, who announced on Sunday that political parties
  had agreed to cut some lawmakers’ perks, including a housing allowance of 50m
  rupiah ($3,075). The allowance, which is nearly 10 times higher than the
  minimum wage in Jakarta, had outraged the public. However, Prabowo, while
  reiterating his government’s respect freedom of expression, also warned: “But
  when demonstrations turn anarchic, destroying public facilities, endangering
  lives and attacking private homes or public institutions, this becomes a
  serious violation of law.” The homes of several political party members and
  state buildings have been targeted by looters or set on fire, including a
  house owned by the finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati.
