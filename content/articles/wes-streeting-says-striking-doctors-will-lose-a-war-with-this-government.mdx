  The doctors union “will lose a war with this government”, Wes Streeting has
  said, adding that the NHS is ready to tough out a prolonged series of strikes
  by the British Medical Association (BMA). In his most outspoken comments so
  far about the dispute involving resident doctors in England, the health
  secretary vowed that Labour would never give in to their demand for a 29% pay
  rise. However, in a plea to the BMA, he urged it to agree a deal based on
  tackling other frustrations those doctors have, separate to their salaries, in
  which both sides would “win the peace”. Fresh talks are planned next week. For
  these to have any chance of success, Streeting said, the BMA should agree it
  will not call any more strikes and accept that other NHS staff deserve decent
  pay increases too, not just medics, who are already paid more than many
  colleagues. “It should be clear to the BMA by now that they will lose a war
  with this government. It’s not too late for us both to win the peace,”
  Streeting said in an opinion piece for the Guardian. It comes after the end of
  a five-day stoppage by thousands of resident doctors that disrupted NHS
  services including cancer care between last Friday and Wednesday morning. “All
  I ask of the BMA is two things. The first is to drop this unnecessary and
  unreasonable rush to strike action. It mars doctors, it harms patients and it
  is fundamentally self-defeating because it leaves the NHS with less money to
  address the issues that doctors care about,” Streeting said. “The second is to
  recognise that this government has a responsibility to all NHS staff and,
  above all, to patients. We can’t fix everything for everyone everywhere all at
  once.” The chances of the negotiations succeeding appear slim. Rejecting a
  potential deal based on non-pay issues such as doctors being able to access
  hot food at night and having part of their exam fees covered, a BMA
  spokesperson said: “This is still primarily a pay dispute and we don’t accept
  there is no room to budge on pay. We need a credible offer on a path to pay
  restoration.” The BMA says resident doctors deserve such a hefty pay rise,
  despite having received an uplift of 22% over the last two years, because the
  real-terms value of their salaries since 2008 has been heavily eroded. The
  union has pledged to strike until it achieves “full pay restoration”. Dr Ross
  Nieuwoudt and Dr Melissa Ryan, the co-chairs of the BMA’s resident doctors
  committee, insisted that Streeting must find some way of upping their 5.4% pay
  award for 2025-26. The end of the five-day strike must be “a moment for the
  health secretary to reconsider his strategy,” they said. If he does make an
  undefined “credible offer” on pay then they said this week’s walkout – the
  12th by resident and formerly junior doctors since 2023 – could be their last.
  In Streeting’s article, he also: Accused the BMA of causing “damage” to the
  NHS through its “reckless” long walkout. Claimed it deliberately sought to
  ruin through strikes the NHS’s effort to cut its 7.4m-strong backlog of care,
  which Labour has pledged to eradicate by 2029. Said the BMA’s 29% demand and
  strike had left other NHS staff “dismayed and appalled”. Streeting, a kidney
  cancer survivor, related how he had spoken last weekend to a patient with the
  same disease whose operation was postponed until late next month because of
  the strike. Patients whose care had to be rescheduled ended up with “fear and
  anxiety” as a result, he stressed. In remarks that may be interpreted as
  implying the BMA’s 29% demand is greedy, Streeting pointed out that other
  health unions such as the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unison were
  unhappy with their members’ pay award – of 3.6% – but were not seeking the
  same huge uplift as the BMA and were not engaged in the same “rush” to
  industrial action. The RCN will on Thursday publish the outcome of an
  indicative vote it has run among nurses in England, Wales and Northern
  Ireland, which is already known to have resulted in a majority coming out
  against the 3.6% award. Hospital bosses have made clear to the BMA that it
  must accept what Streeting has repeatedly insisted and that resident doctors
  will not force him to give a bigger pay award for this year. Rory Deighton,
  the acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, which
  represents NHS hospital trusts, said: “After a week of disruption to services,
  health leaders will be pleased that the BMA wants to resume talks. But it has
  to recognise the red lines set by the government, as the NHS must live within
  its means. “We hope that this [exchange of letters] marks the beginning of a
  dialogue that can resolve this issue without further walkouts which would only
  see patients end up suffering the most.”
