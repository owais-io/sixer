  Good afternoon. The Albanese government confirmed it will permit salmon
  farming to continue in Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania, despite concerns from
  conservationists about the risks to the endangered Maugean skate. The
  environment minister, Murray Watt, wrote to three environment groups on
  Wednesday to notify them of the widely expected decision, which follows the
  passage of amendments to Australia’s nature laws to protect the salmon
  industry earlier this year. The groups had asked the government in 2023 to
  reconsider a 2012 decision to allow a salmon farming expansion in Macquarie
  Harbour without an assessment under Australia’s environmental laws. Watt said
  all relevant information had been carefully considered before reaching his
  decision, but the Bob Brown Foundation and the Australia Institute accused
  Watt of condemning the skate to extinction. Top news David Stratton, esteemed
  Australian film critic, dies aged 85 Childcare workers with ‘red flags’ should

  largest collection of Australian insects and related invertebrates – including
  2.4 million moths and butterflies and more than 1 million beetles. What they
