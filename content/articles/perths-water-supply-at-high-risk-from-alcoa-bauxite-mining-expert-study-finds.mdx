  Alcoa’s plan to vastly expand its strip mining of forest near Perth’s dams
  poses a high risk to the water supply for the city’s 2.3 million people,
  according to global engineering consultancy GHD. The US aluminium producer
  commissioned the detailed analysis as part of its bid for approval to mine an
  additional 67 sq km of jarrah forest for bauxite – the source material for
  aluminium. GHD identified 22 pathways for Alcoa’s mining to contaminate dams
  inland of Perth and concluded that all but one of them presented a high risk.
  The triple threats to the water supply are contamination of the dams by
  pathogens from sewage, hydrocarbons from oil spills (both from Alcoa’s mining)
  or simply excessive soil washing into the dam, which makes the water unclear,
  rendering water treatment plants ineffective. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Extensive reporting has documented how Alcoa’s wholesale clearing of the
  forest and tardy rehabilitation after mining have increased the open area at
  risk of significant runoff, while its preventive drainage works have a history
  of frequent failures. The GHD study of Alcoa’s expansion reinforces concerns
  of the state-owned Water Corporation, which regards contamination of its
  reservoirs from Alcoa’s current mining as certain. The utility faces a bill of
  $3.25bn if it has to upgrade water treatment plants for all dams where Alcoa
  is now mining. If the crucial Serpentine Pipehead dam is contaminated, more
  than 100,000 households could be consuming contaminated water within six
  hours. Within weeks, Perth and Western Australia’s South West could face water
  restrictions. The WA Forest Alliance director, Jess Boyce, said the study
  showed there should be an immediate ban on mining in reservoir protection
  zones, which extend 2km around dams, and a complete phase-out of mining in
  water catchments over the next few years. “This move would not only protect
  critical drinking water supplies for WA but also strong forest habitat for
  threatened plants and animals, including black cockatoos and quokkas, all of
  which are suffering in a changing climate,” she said. Even without mining, the
  highly biodiverse northern jarrah forest ecosystem is at risk of collapse from
  hotter and drier conditions with more fires, according to a 2022 assessment by
  the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Boyce called for a
  transition package for affected communities. The WA government has a $547m
  transition package under way at the coalmining town of Collie, where it will
  shut two coal-fired power stations by 2029. Alcoa depends on WA, where it
  employs about 4,000 people. It extracts three-quarters of its global bauxite
  production from the jarrah forest that is then processed into alumina – the
  feedstock for aluminium smelters – at refineries at Pinjarra and Wagerup. For
  six decades, the $12bn company has mined the jarrah forest shielded from
  regular environmental oversight by a legislated agreement with the state.
  However, it is now facing unprecedented scrutiny on two fronts. The northwards
  march of its mining has reached the edge of Serpentine Dam that supplies
  almost a fifth of Perth’s water, and alarmed government authorities. Now it
  wants access to the forest on the other side of the dam. WA’s independent
  Environmental Protection Authority will assess both Alcoa’s current mining and
  its proposed expansion after public comments on its plans close on Thursday.
  GHD’s damning finding appeared on page 103 of one of 68 documents appended to
  23 main reports Alcoa submitted to the EPA. As well as concerns about the
  water supply, Alcoa is having to defend its record of not completing
  rehabilitation a single hectare of the 280 sq km of forest it has cleared
  since 1963. In late 2023, the WA Labor government stepped in to allow Alcoa to
  keep mining while the WA EPA assessed its current operations. It did so
  despite warnings from Water Corporation and its Department of Water and
  Environmental Regulation, which wrote that Alcoa’s plan “lacks the clarity and
  coherence necessary” and rejected it “in its entirety”. GHD followed a
  guideline from WA’s environment regulator to assess the risk to the water
  supply from Alcoa’s mining. It identified seven pathways for pathogens to
  enter the water supply, each with catastrophic consequences, defined as a
  major impact on a large population, but these would be rare, occurring only in
  exceptional circumstances. An Alcoa spokesman said the guideline recommended
  consequence levels of “catastrophic” for pathogens, and “major” for
  hydrocarbons and turbidity. “Under the risk framework, this level of
  consequence is deemed to have a minimum risk level of ‘high’, regardless of
  the likelihood,” he said. Alcoa planned numerous measures to reduce the risks
  from its expansion, including avoiding mining within 2km of reservoirs and
  improving drainage works to stop runoff into the dams. GHD concluded these
  measures reduced the likelihood of 20 of the risks to “rare” and one to
  “unlikely”. “Alcoa intends to continue its more than 60-year history of
  operating without negative impact to Perth’s drinking water supply,” he said.
  The EPA is likely to release its advice to the WA environment minister,
  Matthew Swinbourn, in 2026, who will then decide the conditions placed on
  Alcoa’s mining based on social and economic factors as well as environmental
  protection.
