  I’m puzzled by the conditions Keir Starmer has set for Israel to meet, failing
  which he’ll recognise Palestine as a state (UK to recognise state of Palestine
  in September unless Israel holds to a ceasefire, 29 July). Why does
  recognition depend on Israel’s actions? Surely it should depend on
  Palestine’s: commitments to abjure terrorism, disarm Hamas, hold democratic
  elections and, of course, to release the hostages. As for Israel, UK policy
  should be to impose draconian sanctions: if Israel continues to act like a
  pariah state, let it be treated as one. Without sanctions, there would
  probably still be an apartheid regime in South Africa. The UK must act now,
  not half-heartedly in September; thousands of children in Gaza can’t wait
  until then. Doug Maughan Dunblane, Perthshire • Like so many people in the UK,
  I thought that my despair and shame over the situation in Gaza could not be
  deepened. Keir Starmer achieved that. How like this prime minister to
  obfuscate further and kick any sense of decisiveness into the long grass of
  contingency. One might think that Britain has some special responsibility for
  recognising the state of Palestine, whose population it abandoned to the
  predations of its neighbour in 1948. What will be left of Gaza, the West Bank
  and its people by September? A genocide? A diaspora? The UK doesn’t negotiate
  with terrorists, just with war criminals. Emeritus Prof Graham Mort Lancaster
  University • Soon after the atrocities of 7 October 2023 I heard someone on
  the radio say, with respect to Israel’s imminent invasion of Gaza, “Beware of
  being goaded by your enemy into doing what your enemy wants you to do.” Nearly
  two years on, the Israeli government seems hell-bent on creating a moral
  equivalence between itself and Hamas. If you become like your enemy, then your
  enemy has won. Thus, despite what it says about recent moves to recognise a
  Palestinian state, the Israeli government, more than any other, is “rewarding”
  Hamas for its terrorist actions. The Rev Rob Kelsey Berwick-upon-Tweed,
  Northumberland • It is impossible for us to know the depth of despair
  Palestinians must feel to hear western nations pontificating that we will not
  recognise them as a nation if their oppressors stop killing them. It seems
  this is the ultimate acknowledgment that they have no rights except those we
  deem to give them. We have expelled them from the land in which they lived to
  ensure that Europe didn’t have the problem of resettling the thousands
  displaced by a European war. They are being attacked in Gaza and the West Bank
  with weapons supplied by western governments. They are being starved in Gaza
  to keep their oppressor-in-chief in office. And now our governments are
  praised for condescending to recognise the fact that they are a nation (that
  has existed for more than 1,000 years). How can we think we have any integrity
  left in our dealings with the oppressed? Michael McLoughlin Wallington, London
  • What will give greater weight to the call for a two-state solution is
  outlining the building blocks for establishment of a Palestinian state: for
  example, Gaza would be placed under UN control to allow for demilitarisation,
  the physical reconstruction and drawing up a basic law to guide the
  development of a constitutional state. Gavin Weir Cape Town, South Africa •
