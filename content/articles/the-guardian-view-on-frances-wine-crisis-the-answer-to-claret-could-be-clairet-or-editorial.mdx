  These are always anxious weeks in the Bordeaux vineyards, where 15% of
  France’s wine is grown, including in celebrated places like Chateau Latour and
  Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. In earlier years, this ritual anxiety among the
  region’s winegrowers had a pleasingly folkloric quality. In the middle of
  August, the grapes would ripen and their colour start to turn. About 45 days
  from now, tradition dictates, it will be time to start picking the 2025
  vintage. As the wine writer Edmund Penning-Rowsell put it: “To pick or not to
  pick is the most momentous decision in the winemaking year in Bordeaux.” This
  once timeless rhythm is now collapsing. Part of the problem is the climate
  crisis. Bordeaux still benefits from its moderate Atlantic climate. But
  south-west France is getting much hotter and drier. Even in the Gironde
  region, maximum temperatures have been close to 40C at times this past week.
  Adaptation, in the form of hardier grapes and greater crop diversity, feels
  unavoidable. A much larger challenge, however, is today’s changing wine
  market. Demand for red wine in general, and for the full-bodied, long maturing
  red wines with generally high alcohol content that are synonymous with
  Bordeaux in particular, has slumped. This has affected not just the signature
  premiers crus in which monarchs and the global rich have always invested, but
  also the vineyards producing the ordinary Bordeaux red wines sold in
  supermarkets around the globe. For a region whose wine output is 85% red, this
  is an existential crisis. Bordeaux produces around 650m bottles of wine each
  year; but it currently sells only 500m. Demand for red wine in France has
  fallen by 38% in the past five years; in the 10 years to 2023 the fall was
  45%. Nor is the slump confined to France. Demand in the Chinese market has
  halved since 2017. US tariffs will undoubtedly hit the 20% of Bordeaux exports
  that previously went across the Atlantic. These consumption changes are likely
  to be irreversible, at least in the short and medium term. A popular response
  for many would be to slash prices. Global Bordeaux prices soared outrageously
  in the Chinese boom years. But with consumers turning away in droves, and too
  many producers operating at a loss, price cuts have not reshaped the market.
  With aid from the French government and the EU, about 15% of Bordeaux
  vineyards have instead been dug up and put to new uses, including olives and
  kiwifruit, since 2019. In the nick of time, there is now a more traditional
  but also genuinely radical idea – to produce lighter and less tannic wines.
  History is on this idea’s side. Bordeaux reds have been known for centuries in
  Britain as claret. But this much debated word dates from when England’s Henry
  II and his descendants ruled in medieval Aquitaine. Back then, the reds of
  Bordeaux were often lighter, fresher wines known as clairet, somewhere between
  a modern red and a rosé, to be drunk young, which for the English meant soon
  after they arrived from their voyage from France. Small amounts of clairet are
  still produced in parts of the Bordeaux region even now. Today there are moves
  to expand production with the aim of winning new consumers who have rejected
  heavier reds. Clairet’s advocates say it should be drunk within a couple of
  years and should be drunk chilled. Traditional claret drinkers will upend
  their decanters in disgust. But clairet sounds just the thing to accompany a
  barbecue over a warm summer weekend.
