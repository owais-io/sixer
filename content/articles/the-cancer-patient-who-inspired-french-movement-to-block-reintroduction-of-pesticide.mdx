  On the day French MPs gave themselves a round of applause for approving
  legislation to reintroduce a banned pesticide last month, a figure rose from
  the public gallery to shout: “You are supporters of cancer … and we will make
  it known.” Fleur Breteau made it known. Her outburst and appearance – she lost
  her hair during chemotherapy for breast cancer – boosted a petition against
  the “Duplomb law” to well over 2m signatures. On Thursday, France’s
  constitutional court struck down the government’s attempt to reintroduce the
  pesticide acetamiprid – a neonicotinoid banned in France in 2018 but still
  used as an insecticide in other EU countries as well as the UK – in a judgment
  that took everyone by surprise. The ruling said the legislature had undermined
  “the right to live in a balanced and healthy environment” enshrined in
  France’s environmental charter. For Breteau, 50, a battle is won but the
  struggle goes on. “The law is a symptom of a sick system that poisons us. The
  Duplomb law isn’t the real problem. It’s aggravating an already catastrophic
  system,” she said. “We are living in a toxic world and need a revolution to
  break the chain of contamination in everything … If people don’t react we’ll
  find ourselves in a world where we cannot drink water or eat food that is
  uncontaminated, where a slice of buttered bread or a cup of tea poisons us. It
  will be a silent world, without animals, without insects, without birds. “We
  are accused of politicising cancer, of weaponising the disease. Yes, that is
  exactly what we’re doing because that is what’s necessary.” In an interview
  with the Guardian between radiotherapy treatments hours before the court’s
  decision, Breteau explained the “injustice and anger” she felt on learning
  that the government planned to reintroduce the pesticide, and how it prompted
  her to create the Cancer Colère (Cancer Anger) collective. She was in hospital
  for treatment for the second bout of cancer in three years when the bill was
  approved by the national assembly’s upper house, the Sénat. “I was having
  chemotherapy and it was really hard. I thought this law would never pass, that
  it would be impossible. When I learned senators had voted for it, I was filled
  with an intense anger,” Breteau said. “And the more I looked at the figures
  for cancer cases, the angrier I became.” In March, the national health body
  Santé publique France published the latest cancer figures that showed cases
  had doubled since 1990, while use of tobacco and alcohol, often blamed for the
  disease, had declined by 25% in the same period. It noted an alarming rise in
  cancers in children and those aged 15-39. Doctors and researchers responded
  with an open letter to Le Monde reporting that there was a cancer epidemic.
  Breteau said: “All the arguments they’ve given us – blaming individuals for
  habits like smoking and drinking or that the population is ageing – don’t hold
  water. “We know where there are lots of pesticides used, there are clusters of
  child cancers, so we can no longer doubt there is a link. Scientists have
  known this for years, but like the tobacco manufacturers, the agriculture
  lobbies know how to create doubt. They want us to prove the cancer of this or
  that person is directly linked to this or that pesticide.” Acetamiprid wipes
  out “sucking” insects on vegetable, citrus fruit and grape crops. First
  introduced in the early 1990s, its use is permitted in the UK where it is
  labelled “highly hazardous”. The potential effect of the neonicotinoid on
  humans is a source of concern, though the risks remains unclear in the absence
  of large-scale studies. Research on bees is inconclusive and controversial: it
  has been argued that acetamiprid is less toxic to the environment and insects
  than other insecticides. Others claim it is responsible for the collapse of
  bee colonies. Philippe Grandcolas, a deputy director at the CNRS, France’s
  national scientific research body, said: “What the studies have shown is that
  acetamiprid is the ‘least toxic, least harmful’ of the neonicotinoids, but
  it’s like choosing between the plague and cholera.” On Friday the French
  health minister, Yannick Neuder, pressed for a Europe-wide evaluation of the
  impact of acetamiprid on human health. “I am calling for a prompt, careful and
  transparent reassessment by European health authorities of the health impact
  of acetamiprid,” he told France Inter radio. Neuder said studies of its
  potential endocrine-disrupting or neurotoxic properties were ongoing. One of
  its manufacturers, the Chinese agrochemical firm Shijiazhuang Pomais
  Technology, has said acetamiprid has “low toxicity to humans and animals … it
  has low toxicity to fish, has little impact on bees and is highly safe”.
  Breteau has told French journalists she felt as if she was 90 years old, but
  she looked surprisingly healthy when the Guardian met her in a community park
  before she had to head across town to the Gustave Roussy hospital for her last
  radiotherapy session. The oncology hospital is said to be Europe’s top cancer
  treatment centre and is ranked as one of the world’s best. Wearing a crossbody
  bag high over her chest, Breteau moved it aside to tap where her right breast
  was. “The first cancer was in the left. This one was in the right. The tumour
  was abnormal and developing far too quickly, but that was not the problem,”
  she said. “In August last year I lost one of my best friends to brain cancer
  that spread and it’s several years now that members of my family and friends
  have had cancers.” Breteau said that while in hospital she was shocked to come
  across toddlers, teenagers and pregnant mothers in the cancer wards. “I
  thought I’d be the youngest. I spoke to my parents, and those of their
  generation and they told me we didn’t have that at your age. When we were 40,
  we didn’t have friends who died of brain cancer.” Breteau said Cancer Colère
  had gone from a handful of activists – mostly those who have or had the
  disease – to about 600 supporters in a matter of weeks. The collective has
  rejected affiliation to any political party and has learned from the gilets
  jaunes movement that demonstrating does not work. In September, Cancer Colère
  will begin a leafleting campaign outside hospitals that points out the dangers
  of pesticides. “There are solutions, farmers who use healthy agricultural
  methods, who respect animals and nature. We must listen to them and
  scientists, but we have to confront politicians and industrialists,” Breteau
  said. “Ordinary people are deeply angry and becoming more so. We’re thinking
  how we become a force.”
