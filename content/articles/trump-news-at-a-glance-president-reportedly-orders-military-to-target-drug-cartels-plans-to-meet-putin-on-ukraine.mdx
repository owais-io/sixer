  Donald Trump has reportedly given a secret directive to the Pentagon to use
  the military to target Latin-American drug cartels that his administration has
  designated terrorist organisations. The order “provides an official basis for
  the possibility of direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil
  against cartels”, according to the New York Times, which first reported the
  directive, citing people familiar with the matter. A US official later
  confirmed the signing of the directive but said military action did not appear
  imminent and it was unclear exactly what type of operations they would carry
  out. The order has forced Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum to calm fears in
  her country of a US invasion. The directive potentially opens the door for
  unilateral American military assaults across Latin America, an unprecedented
  escalation of tactics by a US administration in the region. Trump has made
  going after Latin American drug-trafficking organizations a priority of his
  administration: in February, the state department designated seven organized
  crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations, including five powerful
  cartels in Mexico. Meanwhile, Trump is planning a meeting with Vladimir Putin
  in Alaska on Friday next week to discuss the war in Ukraine, and said that
  ending the conflict would have to involve “some swapping of territories”.
  Mexico rejects US ‘invasion’ as Trump orders military to target cartels
  President Sheinbaum has rejected the idea that the US might invade Mexico
  after reports of Trump’s secret directive to the military. “The United States
  is not going to come to Mexico with their military,” she said during a daily
  news conference on Friday. “We cooperate, we collaborate, but there will be no
  invasion. It’s off the table, absolutely off the table.” Read the full story
  Trump to meet Putin to discuss war in Ukraine Trump has said he will meet with
  Putin to discuss the war on Friday next week in Alaska, saying that an end to
  the three-and-a-half-year war would have to involve “some swapping of
  territories to the betterment of both” Ukraine and Russia. Trump made ending
  the war in Ukraine part of his election campaign and boasted that he would be
  able to end the conflict in his first 24 hours in office. In more than six
  months, however, he has failed to prove he has any leverage with his Russian
  counterpart, who has ignored Trump’s deadlines and continued to strike
  Ukraine. Read the full story Trump ambassador to Israel taunts British PM The
  US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has launched an undiplomatic attack on
  Keir Starmer, comparing Israel’s war in Gaza to the allied bombing of Dresden
  after the British prime minister criticized the Israeli security cabinet’s
  decision to expand the war in Gaza. “So Israel is expected to surrender to
  Hamas &amp; feed them even though Israeli hostages are being starved?”
  Huckabee wrote on social media in response to a post by the British prime
  minister calling for an immediate ceasefire and lamenting the humanitarian
  crisis in Gaza, as well as the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages being
  held by Hamas. Read the full story Texas house again fails to meet quorum The
  Texas House of Representatives reconvened without the necessary number of
  lawmakers to conduct business on Friday, the deadline set by top state
  Republicans before the Democrats who have left for blue states face arrest or
  removal from office. Read the full story No contempt for Trump officials over
  deportations An appeals court on Friday tossed out a judge’s finding of
  contempt against the Trump administration in a case over the notorious
  deportations of Venezuelans from the US to an El Salvador prison without due
  process. The decision from a divided three-judge panel based in the nation’s
  capital vacates a finding from US district judge James Boasberg. Read the full
  story Trump demands $1bn from UCLA to restore federal funding The Trump
  administration is seeking a $1bn settlement from the University of California,
  Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday. The administration suspended
  $584m in federal research funding over allegations of civil rights violations
  related to antisemitism and affirmative action following protests on campus in
  2024. Read the full story Kristi Noem responds to South Park episode South
  Park’s recent satirical depiction of Kristi Noem as having undergone a
  defective cosmetic procedure and shooting dogs has rankled the US homeland
  security secretary, she said in a new interview. “It’s so lazy to just
  constantly make fun of women for how they look,” Noem remarked on Thursday’s
  episode of the Glenn Beck Program podcast – a little more than a year after
  her disclosure in a memoir that she shot and killed her family’s dog on a
  farm. Read the full story What else happened today: Donald Trump ordered
  federal officers to start patrolling Washington DC, launching what the White
  House is calling a seven-day crackdown on “violent crime”. The justice
  department has issued two subpoenas to Letitia James, the New York attorney
  general who Trump has repeatedly criticized, according to reports. The price
  of gold futures soared to a record high after it emerged that the US would put
  tariffs on imports of 1kg bars, in a further trade blow to Switzerland.
