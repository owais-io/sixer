  Senior Republican lawmakers are condemning the decision of their party leader,
  Donald Trump, to fire the leading US labor market statistician after a report
  that showed the national economy added just 73,000 jobs – far fewer than
  expected – in July. The disappointing figures – coupled with a downward
  revision of the two previous months amounting to 258,000 fewer jobs and data
  showing that economic output and consumer spending slowed in the first half of
  the year – point to an overall economic deterioration in the US. Trump
  defended his decision to fire the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
  commissioner, Erika McEntarfer. Without evidence to back his claims, the
  president wrote on social media that numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the
  Republicans, and ME, look bad” and the US economy was, in fact, “BOOMING” on
  his watch. McEntarfer said she was honored to serve as commissioner. “It has
  been the honor of my life to serve as Commissioner of BLS alongside the many
  dedicated civil servants tasked with measuring a vast and dynamic economy,”
  she said in a post on the social media platform Bluesky. “It is vital and
  important work and I thank them for their service to this nation.” But the
  firing of McEntarfer, who had been confirmed to her role in January 2024
  during Joe Biden’s presidency, has alarmed members of Trump’s own party. “If
  the president is firing the statistician because he doesn’t like the numbers
  but they are accurate, then that’s a problem,” said the Wyoming Republican
  senator Cynthia Lummis. “It’s not the statistician’s fault if the numbers are
  accurate and that they’re not what the president had hoped for.” Lummis added
  that if the numbers are unreliable, the public should be told – but firing
  McEntarfer was “kind of impetuous”. The North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, a
  Republican, said: “If she was just fired because the president or whoever
  decided to fire the director just … because they didn’t like the numbers, they
  ought to grow up.” The Kentucky senator Rand Paul, another Republican,
  questioned whether McEntarfer’s firing was an effective way of improving the
  numbers. “We have to look somewhere for objective statistics,” he said. “When
  the people providing the statistics are fired, it makes it much harder to make
  judgments that you know, the statistics won’t be politicized.” According to
  NBC News, Paul said his “first impression” was that “you can’t really make the
  numbers different or better by firing the people doing the counting”. Tillis
  and Paul were both opponents of Trump’s recent economic legislative package,
  which the president dubbed the “big, beautiful bill”. But the Alaska senator
  Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who supported the legislation after winning
  substantial economic support for her state, remarked that the jobs numbers
  could not be trusted – and “that’s the problem”. “And when you fire people,
  then it makes people trust them even less,” she said. William Beach, a former
  BLS commissioner appointed by Trump in his first presidency, posted on X that
  McEntarfer’s firing was “totally groundless”. He added that the dismissal set
  a dangerous precedent and undermined the BLS’s statistical mission. Beach also
  co-signed a letter by “the Friends of the Bureau of Labor Statistics” that
  went further, accusing Trump of seeking to blame someone for bad news and
  calling the rationale for McEntarfer’s firing “without merit”. The letter
  asserted that the dismissal “undermines the credibility of federal economic
  statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by
  businesses, families and policymakers”. The letter pointed out that the jobs
  tabulation process “is decentralized by design to avoid opportunities for
  interference”, adding that US official statistics “are the gold standard
  globally”. “When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it
  has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government
  science,” the letter said. Democrats and others have also hit out at Trump’s
  decision. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders described it as “the sign of an
  authoritarian type”, and he said the decision would make it harder for the
  American people “to believe the information that comes out of the government”.
  Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations
  on Federal Statistics, described the president’s allegation against McEntarfer
  as “very damaging and outrageous”. He said: “Not only does it undermine the
  integrity of federal economic statistics, but it also politicizes data which
  need to remain independent and trustworthy. This action is a grave error by
  the administration and one that will have ramifications for years to come.”
