  Encouraging signs. Gimmers of promises. Green shoots. It is indicative of just
  how far Manchester United have sunk that the reaction to their 1-0 defeat to
  Arsenal last Sunday was not shock or scorn or even schadenfreude; it was
  encouragement. United used to inspire fear in opponents; now they inspire
  pity. It is not that there were no reasons for optimism for United. The new
  forwards who started, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, looked intermittently
  dangerous. Mason Mount offered a reminder of his quality and if he can stay
  fit he could have a major role to play. Patrick Dorgu dominated his flank.
  Amad Diallo sparkled after coming off the bench. David Raya was forced to make
  seven saves. Dorgu hit a post. There were plausible claims for a penalty when
  William Saliba appeared to go through the back of Cunha. Opta’s xG model had
  United winning 1.5 to 1.3. Fans looking for crumbs of comfort could have found
  enough to make a decent meal for a small bird. After months of United being
  terrible, they looked OK. But they still lost. Already they are three points
  behind the leaders and, given the context, there is inevitably already
  pressure. It is probably just as well they face Fulham away on Sunday, because
  Fulham away is as near to a sure thing as there is for United these days. Not
  since 2009 have Fulham beaten Manchester United at home. They have managed one
  draw in the nine games. Craven Cottage is the one ground where United can feel
  safe, a time capsule in which Alex Ferguson still glowers from the dugout, Roy
  Keane still dominates the midfield and Ryan Giggs still speeds down the wing.
  United need to win. If they do not, Ruben Amorim will be back to having the
  worst win percentage of any United manager since Herbert Bamlett, whose
  contract was not renewed after relegation in 1931. In some ways that is a
  quirk, a freak stat that does not take into account the weirdness of last
  season. But it is also a reminder of just how bad United have been under Erik
  ten Hag’s successor. There is no credit in the bank. To believe that Amorim is
  the right manager for United is an act of faith. That is not to say that it is
  misplaced; Amorim looked a very impressive manager at Sporting and he
  inherited an extremely difficult situation. But it does perhaps explain why
  there has been such eagerness to magnify the few fragments of optimism from
  the opening game of the season. The risk United are taking is enormous. Amorim
  is a fundamentalist. He will only play one way. 3-4-2-1 is the one true faith
  and there can be no deviation from that. United’s squad when he arrived was a
  hodgepodge accumulated over the reigns of six managers, with few common
  characteristics other than their mutual unfamiliarity with 3-4-2-1. Some will
  adapt, but many of the playing personnel will have to be replaced, a major
  overhaul to suit a manager who may by Sunday night have the worst win
  percentage at the club in almost a century. Burnley at home a week later
  offers a further opportunity for United to get points on the board, gain
  confidence and bolster faith in Amorim before the much more testing business
  of the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, straight after the
  international break. Perhaps the £200m attacking combination of Benjamin
  Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo can drive United forward. The absence of European
  football should help. But Sunday also demonstrated United’s many shortcomings.
  Neither Altay Bayindir nor André Onana have offered any suggestion they can be
  a consistent high-level Premier League goalkeeper. United, more generally,
  have a major problem dealing with inswinging set-plays. If United can ever
  offload one of the many players they have made clear have no future at the
  club to create profitability and sustainability headroom, and Gianluigi
  Donnarumma is available and interested for a knockdown price, he surely must
  be a priority. Leny Yoro has shown sufficient promise that it is possible to
  think he will be the first senior arrival to get definitively better after
  joining United since Ashley Young and David De Gea signed in the same week in
  2011. Cases could be made for Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot, but they have
  probably done little more than maintain their level – achievement enough in
  the Old Trafford permacrisis. Nonetheless, it is far from clear who Yoro’s
  most effective partners are. Matthijs de Ligt has never convinced since
  leaving Ajax. Lisandro Martínez has been unfortunate with injuries, as has
  Luke Shaw over a much longer period. Harry Maguire, his demeanour increasingly
  that of a put-upon husband from an 80s sitcom, is as much an emergency
  late-game striker these days as a central defender. Ayden Heaven is
  inexperienced. Whoever plays in the defensive three is going to struggle given
  the dearth of options at the back of midfield. Amorim seems convinced by the
  idea of Fernandes as one of the deep-lying players, but if that is to have a
  chance of working he needs an aggressive and industrious ball-winner alongside
  him. Casemiro no longer has the energy, while Manuel Ugarte, who played in a
  similar role for Sporting, has never come close to adapting to the pace and
  physicality of the Premier League, his loss of confidence reflected in some
  bizarre decision-making in the defeat against Arsenal. But the issue of
  Amorim’s dogmatism is not just that of the struggle to find players to fit. It
  is also of the sense of wastage, those players United have who have no obvious
  role in the 3-4-2-1. Is Amad, with his skittering feet and remarkable left
  foot, really best served operating as a right-wingback? And what of Kobbie
  Mainoo, prodigiously gifted, still only 20, a starter for England in the Euros
  final last summer, but not a natural fit for any role in Amorim’s system? How
  much faith do United have in Amorim? Enough to sideline Mainoo’s talents?
  Enough to carry on the overhaul of the squad to his specifications, even
  though that could take a further three or four windows? Enough to keep
  plodding through the wilderness, extolling every wisp of positivity in the
  belief the promised land will at some point be reached? Enough to survive
  defeat at Fulham?
