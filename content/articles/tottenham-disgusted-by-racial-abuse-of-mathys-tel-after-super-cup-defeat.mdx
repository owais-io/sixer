  Tottenham have condemned the online racist abuse aimed towards Mathys Tel
  after the forward missed a penalty in Wednesday’s Uefa Super Cup loss to Paris
  Saint-Germain. Tel was targeted after firing wide in the shootout and his club
  threw their backing behind him after a spate of unacceptable comments on
  social media. “We are disgusted at the racial abuse Mathys Tel has received on
  social media following last night’s Uefa Super Cup defeat,” Spurs said.
  “Mathys showed bravery and courage to step forward and take a penalty, yet
  those who abuse him are nothing but cowards – hiding behind anonymous
  usernames and profiles to spout their abhorrent views. “We will work with the
  authorities and social media platforms to take the strongest possible action
  against any individual we are able to identify. We stand with you, Mathys.”
  Tel, who came on in the 79th minute, joined Tottenham for £30m from Bayern
  Munich in June after a half-season loan. He is the latest footballer to be
  abused in a pattern that social media companies show little ability to arrest.
  Last month, the England defender Jess Carter withdrew from any active social
  media presence after being racially targeted during Euro 2025. The
  anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out said: “If you’re a black player, it
  would be totally understandable to think: ‘Why would I want to take a
  penalty?’ That’s the state of the game right now and the sad fact is, it’s
  nothing new. Players are routinely targeted with racism online and want
  action; we want action, too. “Accountability from offenders and social media
  companies is a baseline, but it’s not being met. Football bodies, authorities
  and the regulator Ofcom must come together to accelerate a plan that better
  protects players.” It was a bleak end to what, for long periods, proved an
  encouraging exercise for Spurs. They were better than a rusty PSG for much of
  the game, leading through goals by Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero, and
  posed problems with some bright running in attack. Mohammed Kudus, who signed
  from West Ham this summer, was lively in a strike partnership with Richarlison
  and said the performance proved they can mix it with the best. “I am really,
  really proud of the team for their work ethic and energy because we had them
  for most of the game. It was just the last part we need to fix,” he said. “We
  competed against one of the best teams in the world and showed we can play at
  that level. It is just [about] staying focused for the whole game. “This is a
  good step, of course a big disappointment, but we have a lot more to play for
  this season, a lot more competitions” The Ghana international Kudus, who
  scored 19 goals in two seasons for West Ham, will have competition for his
  place if Thomas Frank succeeds in adding to his front line. Eberechi Eze and
  Savinho are top targets; Kudus, though, has begun promisingly and believes
  life at Spurs is suiting him well. “I’m very excited to have joined this
  beautiful club,” he said. “I am still settling in, trying to adapt and to get
  used to my coaches, but, with the help of the club, it has been going so
  smoothly. I still have a lot more to show.”
