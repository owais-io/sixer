  The first farmer-led programme to vaccinate badgers against tuberculosis is
  beginning in Cornwall with an aim to prevent transmission of the disease to
  cattle. The programme is significant because farmers and scientists have long
  been at loggerheads over the culling of badgers as a way to control TB. The
  three-year trial will start with 70 farms and involve farmers trapping,
  testing and vaccinating badgers, with training provided by scientists. An
  earlier pilot study of the approach showed TB rates in badgers fell from 16%
  to zero in four years. TB can devastate cattle herds and more than 20,000
  infected cattle were slaughtered in the last year in England. The badger cull
  started in 2013 and has killed about 250,000 badgers but has been highly
  controversial. Most scientists have argued since the start that culling can
  make no meaningful contribution to TB control in cattle, based on a
  large-scale trial from 1998 to 2005. They say most cattle are infected by
  other cattle and that controlling livestock movements are key. Most farmers
  argue that badgers are a dangerous reservoir for the disease and must be
  controlled. The results of the culling to date are contested. Badger culling
  is due to end in 2029. The £1.4m project is the first time the National
  Farmers’ Union has led a badger vaccination programme. Previous badger
  vaccination trials have been conducted by wildlife groups. Prof Rosie
  Woodroffe, at the Institute of Zoology in London, said: “For half a century,
  wildlife advocates and farmers have argued about the best way to manage the
  risk of TB transmission between badgers and cattle. Ultimately, we all want
  the same thing: to see TB eliminated so that farmers, their livestock, and
  wildlife can all thrive. “By working together to compare different approaches,
  we can develop a shared understanding of the evidence and use it to identify
  TB control solutions which are effective and sustainable.” Bridget Whell, a
  farmer and the NFU’s Cornwall chair, is taking part in the project and has
  1,200 cattle serving two dairies. She has lost half the cattle from one of the
  dairies in the past and her farm has spent most of the last 15 years under
  government restrictions due to TB infections. “It was really devastating,” she
  said. There have been six years of badger culling on Whell’s farm but that
  have now ended due to the government’s decision to end culling. “It does seem
  now that in terms of the tools available, aside from biosecurity and [cattle]
  testing, [badger vaccination] is the future,” she said. Cattle vaccines for TB
  are being developed but have been complicated by the need to be able to
  distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals when they are tested.
  “There’s been a lack of confidence [about badger vaccination] because there’s
  been no information,” Whell said. “What we hope to ultimately get out of [the
  project] is whether [badger vaccination] affects the cattle levels of TB –
  that remains to be seen, but I think it’s well worth doing.” “My scepticism,
  if any, is whether this is as a policy is sustainable, financially and
  practically.” The project will begin with 70 farmers over 80 sq km in
  Cornwall, and expand over three years to cover 400 to 500 sq km. It will
  assess the impact of badger vaccination on TB control and examine how
  vaccination can be scaled up and delivered in the most cost-efficient way. The
  project will assess three vaccination approaches to determine which works
  best: annual vaccination over four years, vaccination every other year or
  reactive vaccination based on TB infection on farms.
