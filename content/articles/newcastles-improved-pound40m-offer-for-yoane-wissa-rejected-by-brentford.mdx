  Newcastle have had an improved £40m bid for Yoane Wissa rejected by Brentford
  as they seek to reinforce Eddie Howe’s attack amid uncertainty regarding the
  future of Alexander Isak. As Isak trains separately from his Newcastle
  teammates in an attempt to force a move to Liverpool, Wissa missed Brentford’s
  3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest last weekend as he, in turn, attempted to push
  through a transfer to St James’ Park. Newcastle insist Isak will not be
  allowed to leave the club this summer. Wissa’s potential arrival could yet
  alter that narrative. Despite suggestions from within St James’ Park that
  Wissa is seen primarily as a replacement for Callum Wilson following the
  latter’s move to West Ham this summer, it is striking how much the
  28-year-old’s Premier League scoring statistics from last season mirror those
  of Isak. Wissa scored 19 goals in 35 appearances for Brentford, all from open
  play, while Isak managed 23 goals in 34 appearances, with four of those
  resulting from penalties. Although Wissa, who turns 29 next month, has only
  one year remaining on his contract, Brentford are reluctant to lose him after
  their manager Thomas Frank departed for Tottenham, their captain, Christian
  Nørgaard, joined Arsenal, and Bryan Mbeumo, Wissa’s strike partner at the
  Gtech Community Stadium, left for Manchester United this summer. Newcastle’s
  initial £25m offer for the DR Congo forward was rejected but it was widely
  expected they would return. Their latest offer, submitted within hours of
  Isak’s incendiary Instagram post in which he claimed Newcastle had broken
  promises and breached his trust, is believed to be an initial £35m with a
  further £5m in add-ons. Brentford did not wait long to tell Newcastle it also
  fell short of their valuation for Wissa, which is believed to be between £50m
  and £60m. They could well sell should Newcastle make another improved offer
  given the player’s attempts to leave, which have included deleting all
  Brentford references from his social media accounts. The west London club have
  also added the forward Dango Ouattara to their ranks, increasing Newcastle’s
  confidence of a deal being done in the coming days. Any agreement is unlikely
  to come in time for Howe to field Wissa in the hotly anticipated Premier
  League meeting with Liverpool at St James’ Park on Monday night.
