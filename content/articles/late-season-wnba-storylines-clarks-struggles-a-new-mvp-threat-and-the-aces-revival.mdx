  The WNBA regular season concludes on 11 September after a turbulent summer
  shaped by injuries, comebacks and unexpected contenders. With the playoffs
  looming, here are the narratives that have defined the second half of the
  campaign. Caitlin Clark’s injuries reshape the Fever Unfortunately for the
  Indiana Fever – and their passionate fans – Caitlin Clark has spent most of
  this season in a role no one expected: as a coach from the sidelines. The
  23-year-old has been limited by recurring groin injuries during the second
  half of the campaign. She has not been the Fever’s only casualty. On 7 August
  the team lost Aari McDonald, to a broken foot, and Sydney Colson, to a torn
  ACL. Ten days later Sophie Cunningham tore her MCL, while newcomer Chloe Bibby
  – signed on 1 August to a rest-of-season contract – injured her knee on 22
  August. The string of setbacks has forced the club to cycle through hardship
  contracts and reshuffle its roster every few games. That the Fever remain in
  playoff contention despite such upheaval is a testament to their coaching and
  resilience – but whether that will be enough to meet their 2025 ambitions is
  another question. Natalie Nakase proves a rookie coach can win It’s not yet
  clear whether the WNBA’s newest team will reach the playoffs, but the fact
  that the Golden State Valkyries are even in contention is among the season’s
  biggest storylines. The league’s first expansion side since Atlanta in 2008
  entered the year with a giant lavender question mark over their heads – and
  have steadily erased each doubt since. The Valkyries are led by Natalie
  Nakase, hired away from the Las Vegas Aces after three seasons as Becky
  Hammon’s top assistant. While Nakase has brushed off talk of individual awards
  – “Honestly, I’m just being deadass, our goal is to make the playoffs,” she
  told Clutch Points last week. “It should be coaching staff of the year.” – the
  case for her as Coach of the Year is difficult to ignore. The achievements of
  the Valkyries in their debut campaign will be hard for anyone else to match.
  The Aces are back in contention We are on the brink of the playoffs and
  somehow the Aces – who had a 5-6 record by mid-June and were playing so poorly
  at the beginning of July that even Becky Hammon questioned their abilities –
  ended August ranked No 2 in the league with a 26-14 record and are now within
  reach of a championship run. And sure, this is a team coming off six
  back-to-back winning seasons and two titles, but saying the Aces were bad
  before the All-Star break this year isn’t an understatement. At the core of
  the team’s rapid ascension is the inevitable A’ja Wilson, who is averaging
  23.4 points and 10.1 rebounds this season and has found new and bolder ways to
  carry the team in their lowest moments and inspire them at their peak. Don’t
  be surprised if Las Vegas end up in the finals this season. A new name in the
  MVP race For most of the year the MVP race looked set to come down to A’ja
  Wilson defending her crown or Napheesa Collier wresting it away. That was the
  prevailing narrative at the start of 2025 – and both players did plenty to
  sustain it. But Collier’s ankle injury in early August opened the door for
  another contender. Alyssa Thomas, one of the most complete athletes in
  basketball, has seized the moment and is showing no signs of slowing down. The
  Phoenix Mercury forward is averaging 15.8 points, 8.9 rebounds and 9.2
  assists, numbers that only hint at her impact. Thomas has produced a
  league-high seven triple-doubles this season and became the first WNBA player
  to record at least 10 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a game (her line
  that night was 13-12-16). She has been both floor general and steadying
  presence, quietly steering Phoenix from opening tip to playoff chase. The
  Mercury have dropped 14 games, but rarely through any fault of Thomas. Since
  returning from a calf injury in June, she has been unshakable – and right now,
  she looks like the player most capable of reshaping the MVP conversation.
  Liberty injuries complicate a title defence Injuries have reshaped the season,
  sidelining some of their biggest stars and leaving teams scrambling to adjust.
  No one has felt it more than the Liberty. They lost Jonquel Jones to an ankle
  injury in June, then Breanna Stewart to a bone bruise in late July. Sabrina
  Ionescu also spent time out with a toe problem, while Natasha Cloud has been
  sidelined with a broken nose. If Jones’s absence was damaging, Stewart’s
  seemed to send New York into a tailspin. The Liberty were 17-6 and second in
  the league when she went down; since then, they have slipped to No 5. That
  slide underscores Stewart’s value – and raises the stakes in New York’s bid to
  repeat as champions. To defend their title, the Liberty will almost certainly
  need a top-four seed to secure home-court advantage and avoid a punishing
  early clash with the Lynx. It’s a tall order, but with their roster finally
  healthy again, not an impossible one.
