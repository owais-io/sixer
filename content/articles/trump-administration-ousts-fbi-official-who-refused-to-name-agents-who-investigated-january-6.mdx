  The Trump administration is forcing out a senior FBI official who resisted
  demands made earlier this year for the names of agents who investigated the
  January 6 insurrection, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
  Brian Driscoll briefly served as acting FBI director in the first weeks of
  Donald Trump’s new term, and his final day at the bureau is Friday, the people
  told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not
  authorized to discuss the move. Further ousters were possible. The FBI
  declined to comment to the Guardian. The New York Times further reported that
  the FBI was forcing out Walter Giardina, a special agent who worked on cases
  involving Trump as well as Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to the president
  who was convicted of contempt of Congress. The ousters were the latest under
  the FBI director, Kash Patel, and his deputy, Dan Bongino, who had repeatedly
  alleged that the bureau had become politicized under Joe Biden. Numerous
  senior officials, including top agents in charge of big-city field offices,
  have been pushed out of their jobs, and some agents have been subjected to
  polygraph exams, moves that former officials say have roiled the workforce and
  contributed to angst. The FBI Agents Association, which represents current and
  former bureau staff, issued a statement saying they were “deeply concerned” by
  reports that senior agents and leaders were going to be fired. “Agents are not
  given the option to pick and choose their cases, and these agents carried out
  their assignments with professionalism and integrity. Most importantly, they
  followed the law,” the organization said. “If these agents are fired without
  due process, it makes the American people less safe,” they added, noting that
  they were “actively reviewing all legal options to defend our members”. Mark
  Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said: “The
  continued purging of experienced, non-partisan FBI agents by the Trump
  administration is nothing short of alarming. These are individuals who have
  dedicated their careers to protecting the American people, and their firings
  are part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation and politicization at an
  institution charged with safeguarding national security and the rule of law.
  “President Trump may believe he can manipulate the levers of power to serve
  his own ends, but history will not judge this recklessness kindly, and neither
  should Congress,” he added. Driscoll, a veteran agent who worked on
  international counter-terrorism investigations in New York and also had
  commanded the bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team, had most recently served as acting
  director in charge of the Critical Incident Response Group, which deploys
  people and resources to crisis situations. He was named acting director in
  January to replace Christopher Wray and served in the position as Patel’s
  nomination was pending. He made headlines after he and Rob Kissane, the then
  deputy director, resisted Trump administration demands for information about
  agents who had participated in investigations into the January 6 riot at the
  US Capitol by a mob of Donald Trump’s supporters. Emil Bove, the then senior
  justice department official who made the request and was last week confirmed
  for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo accusing the FBI’s top
  leaders of “insubordination”. Responding to Bove’s request, the FBI ultimately
  provided personnel details about several thousand employees, identifying them
  by unique employee numbers rather than by names. The FBI has moved under
  Patel’s watch to aggressively demote, reassign or push out agents. In April,
  for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed
  kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020
  death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, two people
  familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Numerous special agents in charge
  of field offices have been told to retire, resign or accept reassignment.
  Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign
  or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with
  Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was
  fired by the justice department in 2018 following revelations that he had
  exchanged negative text messages about Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.
