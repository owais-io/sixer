  Morning everyone. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a warmer welcome in
  Washington overnight compared with last February, and there were encouraging
  noises from Donald Trump about possible security guarantees for Ukraine, but a
  ceasefire did not seem to be on the table. Meanwhile, Jim Chalmers’ much-hyped
  economic summit is the big setpiece political event of the day, though it
  risks being overshadowed by a diplomatic stoush with Israel which has
  cancelled some diplomatic visas. Plus: we explain why scientists are excited
  about a “really fun space rock”. Australia Summit summary | Road charges for
  EV drivers, cutting red tape to speed up the construction of houses and AI
  guardrails are expected to be discussed as Jim Chalmers’ long-awaited
  productivity summit begins today. Is it going to change the political weather
  or is it just a “Canberra Coachella”? Tit-for-tat | Israel’s foreign minister
  has revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian
  Authority in a tit-for-tat move following the Albanese government’s refusal to
  grant a visa for Simcha Rothman, a far-right Israeli politician who called for
  Israel’s total control of the West Bank. Chevron challenge | The boss of
  Chevron, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, has given some
  frank advice to Australia – be more like the US and Middle East petrostates to
  attract investment for fossil fuel industries. ‘Really fun rock’ | Scientists
  are excited about comet 3I/Atlas, a “really fun space rock” that is only the
  third interstellar object to be observed. So where is it heading and can
  stargazers see it? Baby death | The body of a dead infant has been found in a
  stormwater drain in Perth, Western Australia police said last night. World
  Hamas accepts deal | Hamas says it has accepted an outline Gaza ceasefire deal
  that would include the release of half of the approximately 20 remaining
  Israeli hostages. Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised massive street protests
  against his handling of the war. Washington welcome | Donald Trump has
  welcomed Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the White House but appeared to rule
  out arranging a ceasefire as part of plans to try to end the country’s war
  with Russia. We have the latest on our live blog of the proceedings. There was
  no repeat of February’s dressing down for the Ukrainian president who was
  supported by a team of European “bodyguards”. Also, read our explainer on why
  Donbas has become critical to the talks Europe ablaze | Relentless heat and
  raging wildfires continue to ravage southern Europe, with a quarter of weather
