  The Islamic Council of Victoria has reported an increase in Islamophobia,
  warning that the number of victims is likely far higher than reported. On
  Saturday, the council held its first conference on Islamophobia, with
  politicians, police, religious leaders and academics among those in attendance
  at the event in Melbourne. In a report released to coincide with the
  conference, it estimated more than 85% of Islamophobia incidents were not
  reported. The council received 96 individual case reports from people affected
  by Islamophobia since 2021, but 26 of these had come in only six months, from
  January to July this year, the council said. Most of the reports related to
  verbal abuse or mockery, followed by workplace discrimination. Islamophobia
  incidents that were not directly reported by a victim – but could include
  occurrences of anti-Muslim racism such as online “hate comments”, emails sent
  to Muslim organisations, “hostile phone calls” and other material including
  “dehumanising media commentary” – had also increased, the council said. It
  reported 3,254 such incidents between January and July. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The council said many Muslims did not report Islamophobia because
  they feared not being taken seriously and had a distrust of police and
  government bodies. “Underreporting makes it easier for institutions to deny
  the scale of the problem,” the ICV found. “It also means many victims never
  access the support, validation or justice they deserve.” Reports of
  Islamophobia and antisemitism have increased amid a backdrop of the war in
  Gaza. On Friday, in New South Wales the Minns government announced a $1m
  program to combat anti-Muslim hate, including establishing a support hotline
  for victims and a program to build awareness of Islamophobia. The initiative
  will fund a support hotline for those experiencing Islamophobia and a case
  management system for victims of abuse so authorities and the community have
  better information about what behaviours are being experienced. The Action
  Against Islamophobia program, which will administer the grant, is run by the
  Australian National Imams Council (ANIC). The ANIC president, Imam Shadi
  Alsuleiman, previously told Guardian Australia there had been a rise in
  anti-Muslim hate, which had left many anxious about engaging in daily
  religious activities, such as praying in mosques or leaving the house wearing
  the hijab. “Islamophobia manifests itself in the community in several
  different ways, and we’ve seen an increase in micro aggressions that are often
  brushed off as ignorance or rude behaviour. “Understanding how Muslims
  experience Islamophobia will help guide our approach to combating the issue on
  a holistic level.”
