  Molly Picklum joined the pantheon of Australian surfing champions after
  claiming her first world title with an imperious display at the season-ending
  WSL Finals in Fiji. The 22-year-old from Gosford dominated 2023 world champion
  Caroline Marks of the US in the final at Cloudbreak after roaring back to post
  a 2-1 victory, having lost the first heat of the best-of-three final. “I
  cannot believe it,” an emotional Picklum said afterwards. “I didn’t make it
  easy for myself. I was pretty excited and made it hard, but I locked in and
  did what I’ve done all year.” Picklum posted a combined wave score of 10.50 in
  the opening heat as Marks pipped her with 12.50 to take the early advantage,
  only for scores of 15.83 and 16.93 in the next two heats to blow away the
  American and secure the Australian’s title. “She [Marks] got me good, but I
  was still kind of there for the first heat, and then, I just found my form
  that second heat to combo, and she made one mistake,” Picklum said. “And then
  to do it again, it just like really solidifies it for me – there’s no ifs or
  buts about my year this year, and I’m so, so grateful to be taking the trophy
  home.” Picklum was ranked No 1 for much of the WSL season having won two tour
  events and only finished lower than fifth once, and her consistency was
  rewarded with a ticket directly into Tuesday’s title decider at the famous
  break in Fiji. Marks, conversely, had to fight through the heats to reach the
  final and by the time she got in the water to face Picklum, she had already
  seen off Bettylou Sakura Johnson, Caitlin Simmers and Gabriela Bryan over
  three qualifying rounds. While Marks began the final strongly, her exertions
  over the course of the day caught up with her and she could only manage
  combined wave scores of 8.03 and 6.24 in the second and third heats against
  Picklum, who at the same time threaded two barrels to impress the judges.
  Picklum follows in the footsteps of Australian greats Layne Beachley, Steph
  Gilmore – who last won the title for Australia in 2022 – and Tyler Wright in
  being crowned world champion. Earlier, Olympic silver medallist Jack Robinson,
  the only other Australian title hopeful this week in Fiji, was unable to
  progress beyond the first heat and exited contention in the men’s event with
  defeat to Brazil’s Italo Ferreira. Ferreira eventually went out to Griffin
  Colapinto who reached the final with victory over Jordy Smith, but lost out to
  top seeded Yago Dora. Dora outscored third-ranked Colapinto 15.66 to 12.33 in
  the first and only heat of the men’s final to become the sixth Brazilian man
  to win the world title in the last seven years. “The signs were all there for
  me and I felt something special this week since I got here,” Dora said. “I
  knew something was going my way, it didn’t matter whoever I was going to get
  in the final things were going to happen and I’m going to come out with the
  win – I’m so happy, it’s unbelievable.”
