  West Ham will step up their hunt for midfield reinforcements after reaching an
  agreement to loan Edson Álvarez to Fenerbahce. The departure of the Mexico
  international gives the club extra funds to bring in new players. West Ham
  want Álvarez’s wages of £115,000 a week off the books and have been waiting
  for him to agree to a season-long loan to Fenerbahce, who have included an
  option to buy in the deal. Álvarez has fallen from favour under Graham Potter,
  who is looking to add energy and creativity to his midfield. West Ham want two
  midfielders – one to sit deep and control play, another to operate in an
  advanced role – and have identified a number of targets. West Ham, who opened
  their campaign with a 3-0 loss to Sunderland, lodged unsuccessful bids for
  Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes, Barcelona’s Marc Casadó and Chelsea’s Andrey
  Santos this week. Their improved offer of £30m plus £2m add-ons for Fernandes
  fell well below Southampton’s valuation of the 21-year-old. Southampton are
  likely to strengthen their financial position and boost their chances of
  keeping the Portuguese midfielder by selling the England under-21 winger Tyler
  Dibling to Everton. Potter views Fernandes as his ideal No 8, but West Ham are
  not willing to meet Southampton’s asking price of £50m and will consider other
  options. The club are tracking Werder Bremen’s Romano Schmid and are
  interested in the Lens midfielder Andy Diouf. West Ham are scouting
  extensively in France and like the 21-year-old Rennes midfielder Djaoui Cissé,
  who is reportedly a target for Inter. They are also looking at the Eredivisie
  and have added Ajax’s Kenneth Taylor to a list that already contains
  Feyernoord’s Quinten Timber. Another player of interest is Torino’s Ivan Ilic.
  A possible affordable option to play further forward is Getafe’s Christantus
  Uche. The 22-year-old Nigerian can play as an attacking midfielder and up
  front. Uche scored and made a goal in Getafe’s win over Celta Vigo last
  Sunday. West Ham remain open to offers for Guido Rodríguez and Andy Irving.
  They have signed four players this summer and have not been working with a big
  budget. Concerns over meeting the Premier League’s profitability and
  sustainability regulations forced them to wait for Mohammed Kudus to join
  Tottenham for £55m before making signings. Meanwhile, Bournemouth are
  exploring a move for the Chelsea defender Axel Disasi, who spent the second
  half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. Disasi, a £38.7m arrival from
  Monaco on a six-year contract in 2023, had an indifferent spell at Villa,
  making 10 appearances in all competitions. Bournemouth want to strengthen at
  centre-back after the sales of Illia Zabarnyi and Dean Huijsen. They have
  added Bafodé Diakité from Lille but are searching for further defensive
  reinforcements. They previously expressed interest in the Chelsea teenager
  Josh Acheampong, who started against Crystal Palace last Sunday. Disasi was
  left out of Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad and did not feature against Palace.
  Bournemouth have done business with Chelsea this summer, with the Serbia
  goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic joining in a £25m deal. They have also signed
  Amine Adli, Ben Doak and Adrien Truffert this window. Luis Sinisterra, signed
  last year from Leeds, is poised to join Cruzeiro on loan. Leeds have signed
  Switzerland forward Noah Okafor from Milan for a reported fee which could rise
  to £18m. Okafor, who spent the later part of last season on loan at Napoli, is
  Leeds’s ninth summer signing after promotion to the Premier League. The club
  said: “Leeds United are delighted to announce the signing of Noah Okafor on a
  four-year contract, subject to a work permit and international clearance. The
  25-year-old arrives at Elland Road on a permanent deal from Italian giants AC
  Milan and can operate across the forward areas on either wing, or as a central
  striker when required to do so.” Okafor, who began his professional career at
  Basel, scored 34 goals and made 23 assists in 110 appearances for Salzburg
  before joining Milan in a £13.4m deal in July 2023. He scored seven goals and
  made five assists in two seasons at the Serie A club, which included his
  four-month loan spell at Napoli. Nottingham Forest have announced the signing
  of Douglas Luiz on loan from Juventus. The 27-year-old Brazilian midfielder,
  who played for Aston Villa for five seasons from 2019, joins on a season-long
  loan with a conditional obligation to buy next summer. Forest’s chief football
  officer, Ross Wilson, told the club’s website: “It’s been a very busy but
  successful period for us in the window in the past few weeks, and Douglas is
  another addition to the squad that will bring significant quality to the
  group. He’s played at the highest level for a long time, understands the
  demands of the Premier League, and has experience playing in elite European
  competition.” PA Media contributed to this report
