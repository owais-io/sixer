  On the first day of this year’s US Open, Alexandra Eala came back from 5-1
  down in the third set to upset Clara Tauson in front of a rapturous crowd,
  Novak Djokovic rope-a-doped a fresher opponent barely half his age, Rebeka
  Masarova hit an overhead smash into the only racket-sized area inside the
  lines that would ensure she lost the point, and Daniil Medvedev all but
  incited a riot in the stands of Louis Armstrong Stadium while down match
  point. Amidst the overstimulating slate of matches, the US Open quietly
  published the first episode of the dating video series Game, Set, Matchmaker
  on their official YouTube channel. In it, host Ilana Sedaka, a figure skater
  and influencer, had a blind date with Ronnie, a lacrosse coach. They exchanged
  bright smiles and music tastes. They bonded over their love of Drake – what
  were the odds? Though the date took place on US Open grounds with players
  practicing in the background, very little of the conversation concerned
  tennis. It is Ronnie’s first time at the US Open: “This place is insane,” he
  said. Slap it on a poster. “Are you a tennis fan?” Sedaka asked midway
  through. “I just got, kind of got into it last year,” Ronnie said. At video’s
  end, Sedaka offered Ronnie a ticket to the US Open so he could join her on a
  second date. Ironically for a piece presumably intended to generate interest
  in tennis, it cut off as they walked onto the grounds. The next episode, a
  charmingly awkward date between influencer Emma and fitness trainer Natalie,
  featured no tennis talk but 30 seconds or so on the NFL. The videos begged the
  question of why exactly the US Open had provided the platform. Per the New
  York Times, a United States Tennis Association spokesperson’s reasoning for
  the series was that it is “trying to attract an entirely new audience,
  reaching fans at the intersection of tennis, pop culture and entertainment”.
  The trouble is that tennis seems absent in the first two episodes of Game,
  Set, Matchmaker aside from the backdrop. The videos sputtered to modest
  viewcounts, outpaced by virtually all of the match highlight reels alongside
  it on the same channel. It seemed that those who came to the US Open’s channel
  did so to watch some of the US Open. It’s difficult to imagine anybody
  becoming a tennis fan on account of these episodes under any circumstances,
  but the rollout of Game, Set, Matchmaker couldn’t have helped. The episodes’
  release schedule wasn’t readily available, and mere days before the pilot
  dropped, the format changed from a Bachelorette-style series, in which Sedaka
  would go on dates with different men, to eight distinct couples on their first
  dates. (Maybe Ronnie proved an unexpected keeper?) But many fans had less of a
  bone to pick with the format than the idea itself – why was this relevant to a
  tennis tournament, again? The US Open set a new attendance record in 2024,
  welcoming more than one million fans through its gates. Tennis participation
  in the US is spiking. The overall prize pot at the US Open is up 20% from
  2024, itself then a record high. Game, Set, Matchmaker implies a lack of faith
  in a product that by all appearances is doing very well. Game, Set, Matchmaker
  isn’t the first attempt to find new tennis fans by eschewing the tennis of it
  all. Break Point, the short-lived tennis Netflix series, was cripplingly
  reliant on player access and allergic to showing tennis footage from a
  recognizable angle. An episode in which Carlos Alcaraz defeated Djokovic in a
  pulsating five-set Wimbledon final bizarrely featured Holger Rune as its
  protagonist. The show depicted the flow of a match as a trio of momentum
  swings: one player seized the initiative, mentally floundered, then recovered
  to seize victory. Forehands and backhands were neglected; tactics may as well
  not have existed. The show seemed geared more towards convincing viewers to
  follow various players on social media than to watch them play tennis. As if
  anticipating their own intense disappointment with Break Point, hardcore fans
  repeated that they were not the target audience, like a mantra, in the lead-up
  to its release. This was true; the goal was to create new fans, not comfort
  existing ones. But too often, this goal is used as an excuse for disappointing
  existing fans, or presenting a distorted picture of reality. In April, Netflix
  released an Alcaraz-focused documentary called My Way, presenting his
  tumultuous 2024 season. Alcaraz won Wimbledon that year when Djokovic netted a
  backhand return off a second serve. My Way instead depicted match point as a
  cinematic, hard-hitting rally that ended with Alcaraz demolishing a forehand
  winner. If Netflix felt it had to embellish the match to the point of
  misleading the viewer, you wonder why they bothered making the documentary in
  the first place. Other sports have dabbled in the Netflix treatment, too, in
  attempts to emulate the wildly successful Drive To Survive. None have matched
  that success; like Break Point, cycling and rugby docs were canceled. The
  mixed doubles tournament preceding this US Open, too, aimed to capture viewers
  through means aside from the tennis they played. The Open cannibalized the
  format with singles stars, forcing out almost all of the doubles specialists
  who had tailored their skills to the format – and who, unlike top singles
  players, rely on these tournaments to make a living. But even that wasn’t
  enough. Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz partnered for the tournament; being
  young, attractive stars, they were inevitable fodder for fanfiction and
  shipping. Most would just expect such fantasizing to come from fans, rather
  than official tournament accounts. The US Open leaned into the partnership,
  hard, and luckily for them Alcaraz and Raducanu played ball rather than
  running for the hills. The tactic successfully sacrificed dignity for outsized
  attention. On one point, against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula, Raducanu
  defended a series of attacks only to be passed by a Draper backhand. Thinking
  the point was over, Raducanu hung her head, and into her peripheral vision
  raced Alcaraz to rescue the rally with a forehand winner around the net. They
  laughed delightedly, white teeth flashed. I forwarded such telegenic clips of
  Alcaraz and Raducanu to my tennis-curious partner, who didn’t watch the
  tournament but later offered “I ship Emmaraz.” I even caught myself enjoying
  the pair’s first-round loss. These style-over-substance tactics are often a
  slap in the face, either to the mixed doubles players who had spent their
  lives training for and excelling at the format, or to the hardcore fan.
  They’re also about fame and fandom more than the sport itself. The film
  Challengers had many virtues and achieved the rare coup of thrusting tennis
  into mainstream discourse, and did not shy away from the sport itself. The
  film returned to the pivotal showdown between two protagonists throughout its
  runtime, taking care to highlight key moments. We saw the match take shape. We
  saw the players’ contrasting styles. We saw sweat drip from their bodies. We
  saw tennis as it was: a prolonged, unpredictable crucible of stress dotted
  with moments of brilliance. The film ended with players and spectators alike
  celebrating a particularly spectacular point. Nonfiction tennis is
  frustratingly resistant to doing the same, despite a dream cast of stars.
  After years of catastrophizing about a world after Serena Williams and the Big
  Three, a handful of supernaturally talented successors have fallen into the
  sport’s lap. Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have taken to playing in the final of
  every big tournament lately, drawing comparisons to great rivalries of old.
  Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka have each enjoyed spells of dominance on the
  WTA yet have no shortage of talented competitors. When tennis is at its best,
  people tend to enjoy it. The US Open and other tournaments would do well
  simply to highlight such instances and do their best to get them in front of
  as many eyes as possible. If someone isn’t interested in that, tennis probably
  isn’t for them, and that’s OK, too.
