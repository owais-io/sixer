  Simon Goodwin, Melbourne’s only premiership coach in the past 60 years, has
  been sacked by the Demons. The former Adelaide champion, who led the club to
  the drought-breaking 2021 flag, was let go following just seven wins this
  season, with Troy Chaplin confirmed as the interim replacement. Taking over
  from Paul Roos in a succession plan for the 2017 season, Goodwin led Melbourne
  to their first premiership in 57 years. But off-field turmoil and dwindling
  performances on the field placed the 48-year-old’s job in jeopardy. President
  Brad Green said the board made the decision on Monday night but it had been
  considering Goodwin’s position over a number of weeks. “We just believed that
  the club was looking for a new voice and a new leader to take this group
  forward,” he said. While the pressure on Goodwin had been building for some
  time, the timing of his axing was ultimately a surprise. The Demons outclassed
  West Coast by 83 points on Saturday and Goodwin was optimistic when speaking
  to the media afterwards. “I’ve got a clear plan, I’m well supported by the
  board in terms of where we’re heading and what we’re trying to achieve, and
  they also understand that sometimes when you’re building something, that
  challenge will occur and what happens is you ride the challenge, you have
  clarity, and you keep building,” he said. Addressing the media on Tuesday,
  Goodwin admitted he “got that wrong”, and while he was disappointed he
  accepted the board’s decision. “We stayed up there in the top four for a
  couple of years post [premiership], which is a really tough thing to do,” he
  said. “And right now we’re in a little transition phase and I certainly
  believe that we’re a hell of a lot closer than what people think.” The club is
  currently being overseen by interim chief executive David Chippindall before
  Paul Guerra, the current CEO of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce, takes over
  next month. Green said Goodwin should be “incredibly proud of what he’s
  achieved at the Melbourne Football Club”. “To take a group of players and help
  shape them into a premiership team is something only four other AFL coaches
  have achieved within the history of the club,” Green said in a statement. “He
  has given absolutely everything, not just as a coach, but as a person and we
  are extremely grateful for his contribution to the red and blue.” Goodwin said
  rather than wait out the season he made the call to step down immediately.
  “It’s just to give the players the clear air,” he said. “I talk to our players
  about the team first mentality and no one’s bigger than the club or bigger
  than the team, and it just gives them a pathway forward to finish the year
  really strongly.” Former Demons captain Garry Lyon said he was “absolutely
  stunned” by the board’s decision. “I thought that there would be a long review
  at the end of this year and then determine whether he coached out his final
  year [of his contract],” he told radio station SEN. “Premiership coaches are
  pretty rare at the Melbourne footy club, he’s one of four, he will be a hero
  of this football club forever and a day, but that obviously doesn’t guarantee
  your tenure, and this is a massive call.” Goodwin has been a target of online
  vitriol in recent weeks, including an apparent death threat, and the AFL
  provided additional security at Marvel Stadium on Saturday. He has been the
  club’s most prominent voice during a period since the 2021 flag in which the
  Demons have been drawn into repeated controversy. Former Demons club doctor
  Zeeshan Arain alleged last year players had been pulled from selection to
  protect them from possible drug testing on game day that would see them
  suspended. Defender Joel Smith received a four-year ban for returning a
  positive test for cocaine in 2023. Star midfielder Clayton Oliver has faced
  personal struggles and has struggled to recapture his premiership form,
  although that is an allegation that could be levelled at much of the Demons’
  side during the period. The club finished fourth in 2023, but dropped to 14th
  the following year to miss the finals for the first time since 2020. Melbourne
  currently sit 12th on the ladder, but are out of finals contention. The club
  has called a press conference for Tuesday afternoon.
