  ‘Sir, are you aware those are women’s clothes?” Even the most basic
  interactions can be fraught when you’re transgender, and Sam Nicoresti builds
  their show around one such happening. Misgendered by a shop assistant, we find
  Sam in a department store changing room, squeezing into a dress from which
  they’re then unable to extricate themselves. How to escape this with some
  shred of dignity intact? It’s a big-hitting and farcical standup sketch,
  delivered with such self-deprecating joyfulness by Nicoresti that you almost
  forget the sensitivity of its subject matter. That’s of a piece with the rest
  of Baby Doomer, a set that addresses with grace and buoyant humour our host’s
  wrestle with their gender and mental health. No tub-thumping here, just a
  high-joke-count hour from an act still learning how to be a woman (and quick
  to caricature how imperfectly they’re doing so) but cocky about their
  credentials as trans. It’s a step forward, and towards a more mainstream brand
  of standup, too, after Cancel Anti Wokeflake Snow Culture, the quirky
  multimedia offering that established Nicoresti three years ago. The show takes
  that pressure-cooker changing room experience as a prompt to explore
  Nicoresti’s life in a Britain not always accommodating to a natal male walking
  down the street in a skirt suit. To whom might they look for a role model?
  Nicoresti proposes Sméagol/Gollum, greatly to the amusement of fellow nerds in
  the front row. Are they aunt Sam to their nephew, or uncle Sam? Should
  marriage be preferred to a polycule, or would it merely endorse the
  cis-normative status quo? As if to emphasise Nicoresti’s repositioning as a
  standup who wouldn’t look out of place on Live at the Apollo, there’s a
  home-banker routine about having sperm frozen (mirroring Tim Key’s and Ian
  Smith’s set pieces elsewhere in town), and another about receiving a walking
  tour-style induction at the local gym – “as if I’m the king”, says Nicoresti,
  in a choice image. It’s quite the trick Nicoresti pulls off here, never
  soft-soaping the challenges of life as a trans woman while making of it an
  ebullient hour of comedy. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August
