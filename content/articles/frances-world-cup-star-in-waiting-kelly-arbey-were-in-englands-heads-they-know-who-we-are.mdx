  Kelly Arbey has made a habit of scoring against England. Having made her mark
  with a hat-trick of tries for France Under-20s against the Red Roses a year
  ago, the jet-heeled young wing added to her record with a spectacular solo try
  for the senior team at Twickenham in April, holding off two defenders from a
  standing start before speeding down the line. The Red Roses responded within
  minutes but the effort was a catalyst for a late resurgence from Les Bleues in
  the Six Nations decider. “We were under pressure at that point of the game, so
  it helped us get back into the match and gave the team a boost,” says Arbey.
  “I’m very proud of it.” Arbey’s stunning try helped stake her claim for a spot
  in the World Cup squad. “I hadn’t played against England at that level before,
  so this was something else entirely. The game was a lot quicker, the hits were
  harder, and to play against an England side who are that good gives you a
  boost.” The 20-year-old echoes the French camp’s sense of optimism after
  pushing England all the way, despite ultimately falling to a 15th straight
  defeat: “We made an impression on the best team in the world, so it’s very
  positive. “We showed that we can compete with them. The result hurt us, but it
  also makes us want to come back stronger.” A native of the Tarn département,
  Arbey began playing rugby at her father’s former club Revel before joining
  Castres at an early age, training alongside her studies. Arbey, who also took
  up football, tennis and judo as a child, was inspired to start playing rugby
  by her older brother when she was four. “He had an important role in my life,
  and still does today. He stopped playing after three years, but I kept going.”
  She made the short move south-west to sign for Toulouse, then the reigning
  national champions, in 2022. “That’s where it all began, where the gates to
  the French national teams were opened to me,” she says. “At Toulouse, our
  training sessions were during the day, the same as for the boys, and it was
  more professional.” Arbey is one of the youngest players in France’s World Cup
  squad, which the head coaches Gaëlle Mignot and David Ortiz finalised this
  week. While she only graduated to the senior national team in March 2024, the
  following 12 months gave her international experience on several fronts as she
  crossed over to sevens. “I wasn’t doubting myself, I just took things as they
  came,” she says of a year which saw her juggle between two codes all the while
  continuing her physiotherapy studies. “It was a bit unexpected, it happened
  after a few players were injured,” Arbey admits of her debut against Ireland
  in last year’s Six Nations. “I took it as a big opportunity, I still had to
  prove myself. I worked hard, both on and off the pitch, and I got the chance
  to play.” Her first try for the XV de France came just a week later, against
  Scotland. Arbey’s inclusion in the sevens team after the Paris Olympics, which
  saw her take part in the Dubai, Cape Town and Perth tournaments, also proved
  pivotal for her progression. “It’s helped me a lot in terms of my reading of
  the game, especially of open spaces. “Technically speaking, I was able to
  improve my passing and kicking games. It also helped with my cardio, since
  it’s a sport where everything is always at full speed.” Playing several
  matches in quick succession over the course of a weekend also helped her to
  build up a capacity for recovery. “When you lose a match in Sevens, you have
  to be able to move on to the next one quickly. That mentality helps me a lot
  and I think it’s very positive – now I can say, OK, we’ve lost against
  England: where did it go wrong and what can we do to stop that from happening
  again?” The decision to phase Arbey back into the senior team at the start of
  the year has more than paid off. “The coaching staff help me really well with
  that transition. Every time I go back to union from sevens, and vice-versa, I
  spend a month back in Toulouse getting accustomed to it again.” The Stade
  Toulousain back also plans to remain involved in sevens for the foreseeable
  future: “Next year, I’ll be back with them to prepare for the next Olympics.
  It’s a longer-term objective, but it’s something to keep in mind, it’s in
  three years and we need to be ready for it.” For now, though, the focus is on
  beating England, in Saturday’s warm-up match in Mont-de-Marsan and in the
  World Cup. “The goal was to leave our mark, to show that we’re here. Now that
  we’re in their heads, and they know who we are, we’ll have to keep pushing to
  get the win.” Like the rest of the France setup, however, Arbey is acutely
  aware of the aspects Les Bleues have needed to improve: “When you’re playing
  against a team of that level, you know that any error will cost you points, so
  you have to be disciplined. That’s something we need to work on.” A semi-final
  against England next month could stand between France and a first-ever World
  Cup final. Arbey is not looking that far ahead, though: “We can’t start
  imagining ourselves in the final – we’ll have to win our other matches first
  to build up our confidence. “In the group stage we’ll be starting off against
  Italy, who are a hard team to beat. We played well against them in the Six
  Nations, so we need to continue in that vein. We played against the South
  Africans in a training match as well, and we saw how combative they are. There
  won’t be any room for easing up. Personally, my aim is just to be
  well-prepared for the tournament and to earn some caps.” While she is more and
  more a key member of the France squad, Arbey insists she is still “building”
  herself, with the help of senior teammates such as Pauline Bourdon-Sansus and
  Charlotte Escudero. “They’re amazing, they really support me a lot. My status
  in the squad might have changed in the sense that I’m more integrated in the
  team, but I’m still just focused on improving my performances.” In
  Mont-de-Marsan, the 20-year-old will earn her sixth senior cap against an
  increasingly familiar opponent. While some of the more seasoned Bleues have
  downplayed the importance of a potential win, Arbey has struck a more
  combative, confident tone: “We’re not talking about a warm-up match here. We
  have to leave our mark on them and give it our all.” ‘It’s far from a
  friendly’: England enter hostile territory The Stade André-et-Guy-Boniface,
  named for the brothers who shone for Les Bleus and led resident club Stade
  Montois to their only national title in 1963, is gearing up to host its first
  senior international Test. With over 7,000 tickets sold (higher than the Pro
  D2 side’s average attendance), locals of the south-western town, deep in
  France’s rugby heartland, will be turning up in their numbers under scorching
  temperatures. While England coach, John Mitchell, will be prioritising
  performance over result on the trip to the Landes, extending a 15-match
  winning streak over his team’s strongest continental challengers would be the
  ideal way to cap off the lengthy World Cup preparations. After a demolition of
  Spain last Saturday, in which the Red Roses’ points tally fell just shy of a
  century, the blockbuster clash with France will invariably make for a sterner
  test. Mitchell has made 11 changes to the side that dismantled Las Leonas,
  with the absentees including Marlie Packer through suspension and Emily
  Scarratt due to a head injury. The former captain is expected to return for
  the tournament opener against the US in Sunderland on 22 August, once her
  one-match ban for a dismissal against Spain has been served. The lineup is not
  short of star names, though, with reigning World player of the year, Ellie
  Kildunne, indisputably the face of the tournament, making her return from
  injury. The full-back will be taking to the field for the first time in four
  months, with Les Bleues having been spared from her try-scoring exploits in
  the Six Nations decider in April. The captain, Zoe Aldcroft, is also back in
  the team at flanker, while Zoe Harrison will hope to strengthen her claim as
  England’s starting fly-half. Scheduling just the one warm-up match, against
  the top-ranked side in the world no less, does seem to be an ambitious
  approach for France. “In our minds, both for the coaching staff and the
  players, we’re ready to evaluate ourselves,” the co-head coach Gaëlle Mignot
  said on Thursday. “There’s no better opponent in terms of figuring out what we
  still need to work on.” Despite the Red Roses’ dominance on the continental
  stage over the last few years, Le Crunch has lost none of its bite. “It’s far
  from a friendly,” France winger Marine Ménager said. “We’ve had a lot of
  defeats to England, but if we want to progress, we’ll need to stop thinking
  about it all the time. Let’s see if we manage to compete with then.” The squad
  picked to take to the field in Mont-de-Marsan resembles the one that nearly
  turned the match around at Twickenham in April, led by the co-captains Manaé
  Feleu and Ménager. Pauline Bourdon Sansus is serving two-match suspension for
  her critical comments on the -refereeing of the French domestic final that her
  Toulouse team lost to Stade Bordelais, with Alexandra Chambon stepping up in
  her place. “We know that England began their training camp before us, they’re
  a well established team,” said the flanker Teani Feleu earlier in the week.
  “It’ll also be a chance for them to see where they are with their
  preparations.” If all goes to plan, the cross-Channel rivals will meet again
  in Bristol in five weeks for a World Cup semi-final – a hurdle France have
  never cleared in eight attempts since 1991. Breaking the losing streak against
  the cross-Channel rivals tonight would go a long way towards making that
  potential obstacle somewhat less daunting. It is an entirely different kind of
  pressure for the Red Roses, who will look to cap off their golden age with a
  second World Cup title, this time on home soil.
