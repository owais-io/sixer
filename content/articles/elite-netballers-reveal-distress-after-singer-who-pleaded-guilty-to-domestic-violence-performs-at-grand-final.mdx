  Australia’s elite netballers have expressed their disappointment that an
  artist who performed at last week’s Super Netball grand final has previously
  pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges. Siala Robson, who appeared on The
  Voice in 2020, was one of three Universal Music singers selected to entertain
  more than 15,000 netball fans during half-time at Rod Laver Arena last
  Saturday. Robson appeared in court in Queensland last year and pleaded guilty
  to two charges of assault occasioning bodily harm in a public place while
  adversely affected by an intoxicating substance. No conviction was recorded
  and Robson was ordered to pay $1,000 in compensation and given a community
  service order of 60 hours. Players union the Australian Netball Players’
  Association [ANPA] issued a statement on Friday expressing the distress of
  their athletes. “ANPA is extremely disappointed that an individual, who has
  previously been found guilty of domestic violence charges, was engaged to
  perform at one of the sport’s premier events,” it said. “This decision has
  caused genuine hurt among the playing group and undermines the values they
  stand for – particularly their strong and ongoing commitment to ending
  domestic violence in Australia.” Netball Australia issued a statement saying
  they were not aware of the offences committed by Robson before the event and
  the matter was only brought to their attention after the match. “Netball
  Australia has a zero-tolerance position on violence and actively campaigns
  against domestic violence with the support of our playing group, who are
  deeply connected to this society-wide issue,” it said. “With respect to the
  necessary checks and balances in place, we relied on the third-party agency we
  partnered with to supply the talent. This was not sufficient and Netball
  Australia will immediately strengthen its event risk management protocols to
  ensure this doesn’t happen again.” Universal Music has been contacted for
  comment. ANPA said they acknowledged Netball Australia has accepted
  responsibility for “this serious oversight” and appreciated the governing
  body’s commitment to ensuring it does not happen again. “Our players have
  consistently used their platform to advocate for change,” the union said.
  “They wore purple armbands at every Suncorp Super Netball match last year to
  raise awareness of violence against women, recently produced a video
  reaffirming their commitment to being part of the solution, and continue to
  work on further initiatives aimed at making Australia safer for all.”
  Melbourne Vixens defeated West Coast Fever in the entertaining decider,
  watched by a record crowd of 15,013. The total attendance for the Super
  Netball season was 386,455, making it the past year’s most-attended women’s
  sporting league in Australia. • In Australia, the national family violence
  counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the UK, call the national domestic
  abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid. In the US, the domestic
  violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Other international helplines may
  be found via www.befrienders.org.
