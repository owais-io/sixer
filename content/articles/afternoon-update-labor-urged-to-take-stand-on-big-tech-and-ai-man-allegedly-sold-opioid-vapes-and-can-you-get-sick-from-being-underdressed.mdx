  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. Arts, creative and media groups have
  demanded the government rule out allowing big tech companies to take
  Australian content to train their artificial intelligence models, with
  concerns such a shift would “sell out” Australian workers and lead to “rampant
  theft” of intellectual property. The Albanese government has said it has no
  plans to change copyright law, but any changes must consider effects on
  artists and news media. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has demanded that
  copyrighted material must not be used without compensation. “It is not
  appropriate for big tech to steal the work of Australian artists, musicians,
  creators, news media, journalism, and use it for their own ends without paying
  for it,” Ley said on Wednesday. Top news US research station staff evacuated
  from Antarctica in high-risk operation News Corp’s Australian newspaper

  there’s no place in the game for it. The last thing you want to see is kids

  after Wests Tigers players used a gesture offensive to some
  Lebanese-Australians in Sunday’s victory over Canterbury-Bankstown. The NRL
  let the players off with a warning after they used “the khawd” – but some
  Lebanese-Australians felt the incident had been blown out of proportion. Full
  Story The Descendants episode 2: the search for Tom Wills For several years
  there have been suggestions that in the 1860s Tom Wills, Australia’s first
  sports hero and a founder of Australian rules football, may have taken part in
  the massacres of Gayiri people in central Queensland. Now, in a Guardian
  Australia investigation, Indigenous affairs reporter Ella Archibald-Binge
  travels in search of the truth behind the allegations. In this two-part
  special Full Story, she and Lorena Allam from UTS’s Jumbunna Institute discuss
