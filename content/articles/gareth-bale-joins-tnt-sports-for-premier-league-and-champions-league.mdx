  Gareth Bale has joined TNT Sports as one of the broadcaster’s main pundits
  this season. The former Real Madrid and Wales forward has signed a deal to
  work on its Premier League and Champions League coverage throughout the
  2025-26 campaign. Bale will join TNT’s lineup of Peter Crouch and Joe Cole in
  its live coverage of the Premier League on Saturday lunchtimes, with Owen
  Hargreaves, Steve McManaman, Ally McCoist and Karen Carney also among its
  pundits. Bale is understood to have impressed TNT executives with his analysis
  of Tottenham’s Europa League final triumph against Manchester United in Bilbao
  in May. The 36-year-old had been used previously in its coverage of
  Liverpool’s Champions League group game against Real Madrid. Bale is a
  high-profile replacement for Rio Ferdinand, who opted not to sign a new
  contract at the end of last season after 12 years at TNT, which until last
  year was known as BT Sport. Ferdinand left to pursue other business interests
  and to spend more time with his family. TNT has exclusive rights to 52 Premier
  League matches this season, 32 of them 12.30pm Saturday kick‑offs and two
  complete midweek rounds. The midweek fixtures will be spread from Tuesday to
  Thursday, with kick‑off times of 7.30pm and 8.15pm in an attempt to increase
  viewing figures. In the first year of a new four-year rights cycle, more
  Premier League games will be broadcast live this season than in previous
  seasons, with Sky Sports showing 215 matches live, starting with Liverpool
  hosting Bournemouth on Friday evening. All games that do not kick off at 3pm
  on Saturdays will be available live, either on Sky or TNT. TNT also has
  exclusive rights to every Champions League, Europa League and Conference
  League fixture other than one Tuesday night Champions League game, which will
  be streamed by Amazon Prime. TNT also starts a new four-year deal for the FA
  Cup this season, with the contract including the Community Shield between
  Liverpool and Crystal Palace at Wembley on Sunday. While TNT bought exclusive
  rights for the competition, the BBC will show 14 games, including two
  quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. TNT declined to comment, but the
  broadcaster is expected to confirm its punditry lineup for the season at the
  start of next week.
