  Many of us crave the rest and relaxation of a holiday, but long days of travel
  can also be a recipe for restlessness, fatigue, dry skin and bleary eyes –
  especially if you throw early wake-ups into the mix. Skin feels the effects of
  travelling even if you’re not moving outside your time zone. As consultant
  dermatologist Dr Anjali Mahto says, long stints sitting in train carriages,
  ferries, cars or planes “expose skin to stressors, such as aircon or low cabin
  humidity, which can make it feel tight or dry, due to what’s known as
  transepidermal water loss.” She adds that “disrupted sleep patterns,
  dehydration from limited water intake, and poor diet choices” can lead to
  dullness, puffiness and inflammation. Eyes are particularly affected by long
  trips, especially if you’re looking at a phone or other screen for long
  periods, or a contact lens wearer with naturally dry eyes like myself.
  “Screens cause us to blink less, while dry air and overall dehydration can
  leave eyes gritty, sore and tired,” says consultant ophthalmic surgeon Ali
  Mearza. However, a little pampering on the go, plus some smart tech, can help
  to mitigate the worst effects. This year, I’ve taken train journeys across
  Italy, an overnight long-haul flight to Sri Lanka, and mini buses through the
  hairpin roads of the Alps. Along the way I’ve tried and tested plenty of
  products. These are the travel beauty saviours that have kept me feeling my
  best, many of which I wouldn’t go on a trip without. *** Beauty hacks for long
  journeys *** Keep hydrated Larq bottle filtered flip top, 500ml £49.50 at Larq
  £39.95 at Amazon Dehydration can exacerbate skin dryness and dullness after
  travel, so keep on track by drinking the recommended six to eight cups of
  fluid a day. Larq’s sleek smart-tech water bottle has a filtration system that
  removes heavy metals, chlorine and other particulates to improve the taste of
  tap water on the go. It comes on a carabiner so you can pop it on a backpack
  when you need to be hands-free. For more, read our guide to the best water
  bottles tried and tested *** Calm your nerves Ross J Barr Calm patches £15 for
  10 at Selfridges £15 for 10 at Victoria Health If, like me, travelling makes
  you feel a little antsy or fatigued, you may find these herb-infused
  aromatherapy patches help you feel more at ease. I pop them on the temples or
  wherever I’m seeking relief – they have a soothing effect and can be used for
  many things, from headaches to tension and even brain fog. Pat them on to skin
  for a couple of minutes to allow them to work. These include chuanxiong for a
  calming effect, safflower to reduce inflammation and asarum for aches and
  pains. *** Multitasking skin spray Clinisoothe+ skin purifier, 100ml £14.95 at
  Sephora £14.20 at Amazon If you’ve not heard of hypochlorous acid, then it’s
  time to get familiar. Beauty insiders swear by its effectiveness at calming
  and cleansing skin. It has a skin-neutral pH, so it’s gentle on sensitive and
  acne-prone complexions. Clinisoothe is a multitasking skin spray with a high
  purity of hypochlorous – and for me, it’s a must-have when travelling. Spritz
  it on your face – keep your eyes closed – or body whenever skin feels tight,
  irritated, or in need of a cleanse. I also use it on surfaces in my vicinity
  when on a long-haul journey. Don’t let the word acid scare you: hypochlorous
  acid is naturally produced by the body as an antimicrobial with healing
  function. *** Hydration for the eyes Peep Club instant relief eye spray, 17ml
  £15 at Peep Club £15 at Amazon If you suffer from dry eyes like me, Peep
  Club’s gentle spray provides instant relief for dry and itchy eyes. A single
  spray on closed lids hydrates and comforts not just the eyes, but the delicate
  eyelid and undereye area too. It contains colourless sea buckthorn oil to help
  soften skin and lock in moisture. *** A nice smell to escape any bad ones Diem
  Quiet Riot eau de parfum £25 for 10ml plus case at Diem You can’t control the
  smells around you, especially on public transport, but you can control your
  own. I like to pack a mini perfume to transport myself somewhere
  sweeter-smelling at a moment’s notice. Diem’s reusable twist-to-release case
  and 10ml minis are ideal for travel, and are eau de parfums, so they’re longer
  lasting than diluted eau de toilettes. I love Quiet Riot: it has fresh matcha
  and basil leaf notes, and the magnolia and osmanthus are comforting and
  calming. For more, read our guide to the best travel minis *** An app to help
  with jet lag Timeshifter app £9.99 per plan or £21.99 a year at Timeshifter If
  you’re changing time zone on your trip, then several things can help minimise
  the jet lag: light exposure, altering your bedtime and wake-up alarm and
  controlling caffeine intake. This app has been a saviour for me on long-haul
  trips as it does all the hard work for you, suggesting new timings for your
  routine once you input your flight details. *** Lightweight glasses for long
  journeys Jimmy Fairly Elvie frames From £135 at Jimmy Fairly For comfort and
  hygiene, contact lenses are best swapped for glasses during travel, especially
  in aeroplane cabins where low humidity can dry out eyes. Larger frames can
  feel cumbersome when worn for long periods, so I like Jimmy Fairly’s petite,
  Miu Miu-style Elvie ones as they’re lightweight and comfy. *** Drink greens on
  the go WelleCo the Super Elixir mini £2 at WelleCo High-sodium travel snacks
  can leave you feeling sluggish, bloated and dehydrated – not helped by sitting
  still for hours. So, when packing fresh food isn’t an option, I pop a greens
  powder in my water bottle to add antioxidants and fibre to my fluid intake.
  Elle Macpherson’s WelleCo Super Elixir comes in sachets that are super-handy
  for travel, and I enjoy the taste much more than many similar products. ***
  Antioxidant capsules Beauty Pie Superactive capsules £27 at Beauty Pie These
  Beauty Pie capsules are filled with serum for a dose of the antioxidants
  vitamin E and C, which help shield skin from light and pollution damage. Twist
  the neck of a capsule to release the serum and apply before moisturiser in
  advance of a long journey. I transfer a bunch to a reusable travel pot to use
  on the go. *** Remove your makeup Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water
  cleanser for sensitive skin, 100ml £6.49 at Superdrug £6.50 at Look Fantastic
  Makeup can quickly make skin feel tight on planes and trains and is likely to
  clog pores in such occlusive conditions. I whip it off as soon as I can with
  micellar water. Bioderma’s is a lovely toning formula that removes every trace
  when used with a reusable pad, and feels nice and refreshing. It also means
  you don’t have to splash any water from a sketchy onboard sink on your face.
  *** Soothe tired eyes Summer Fridays Jet Lag undereye patches £25 for six at
  Space NK £25 for six at Sephora Summer Fridays’ cult patches are the perfect
  in-flight treat for tired eyes. They’re filled with ingredients to soothe the
  delicate eye area, from hydrating glycerine to calming panthenol and
  niacinamide, as well as caffeine to reduce puffiness. I wear them for about 20
  minutes on clean skin, then follow up with moisturiser and SPF so I’m ready
  for arrival. *** A handbag-sized moisturiser Alpha-H High Tide water cream,
  15ml £15.99 at Cosmetify £15.99 at Face the Future Pack a light, quenching
  moisturiser such as this water cream in your handbag to apply before and
  during your long journey. My skin drinks up Alpha-H’s water cream easily, and
  it leaves it looking healthy and dewy. *** Wear a broad-spectrum SPF Ultra
  Violette Future Fluid SPF50+ superlight mineral skinscreen, 50ml £38 at Boots
  £38 at Cult Beauty UVB rays can’t penetrate through windows, but UVA rays –
  which contribute to skin ageing and damage – can. So a broad-spectrum SPF is a
  must, even if you’re inside. Ultra Violette’s new formula is light and won’t
  clog pores, plus it feels smooth to apply. For more, read Sali Hughes’s guide
  to the best sunscreens *** Skin barrier protection Sunsolve MD Detox + Shield
  SPF50, 48ml £77 at Liberty Sunsolve MD’s Detox + Shield SPF50 is designed to
  protect the skin from environmental stressors, with a mineral formula (meaning
  it creates a physical barrier on the skin) that still feels lightweight. It
  also promises to strengthen the skin’s protective barrier over time, so if you
  have sensitive skin and are hopping between cities, it could be worth the
  hefty price. *** Block out stressful noise Loop earplugs Quiet 2 £19.95 at
  Loop Earplugs £19.95 at Amazon I’m sensitive to noise and swear by Loop’s
  reusable silicone earplugs to keep me feeling calm in loud spaces, or to help
  me switch off when it’s time to sleep. They’re easy to clean and come in a
  travel case. *** A lip mask for long journeys Drunk Elephant Plump-C
  tripeptide lippe mask, 15ml £26 at Sephora £26 at Cult Beauty The sensitive
  skin on lips can feel particularly parched while travelling, so patting on a
  lip mask during a long journey, or the night after, can help keep them juicy.
  This new Drunk Elephant launch is a treatment version of its popular balm,
  restoring hydration and softness with marula oil and shea butter. It also has
  a plumping effect, if that’s your bag. For more, read our guide to the best
  lip balms tried and tested *** A luxury travel pillow Slip Jet Setter striped
  silk travel pillow £120 at Selfridges £120 at Sephora Spending hours lying on
  a synthetic pillow can leave skin feeling itchy or aggravated – especially
  when you’re in close, occlusive conditions. Slip’s silk travel pillow feels
  like the ultimate luxury, and is much more comfy than plane handouts. ***
  Treat your skin Beauty of Joseon centella asiatica calming mask £5 each at
  Superdrug £6 for three at Look Fantastic Applying a sheet mask is a great way
  to treat skin during transit, even if you get a few funny looks. K-beauty
  favourite Beauty of Joseon’s soothing centella asiatica mask is made with
  three types of hyaluronic acid for intense hydration and won’t stress
  sensitive skin. Apply on a cleansed face or on top of a serum, wear for about
  20 minutes and massage the remaining product into the face and neck. ***
  Massage your face FaceGym Face Coach Q10 face oil, 30ml £56 at Look Fantastic
  £56 at Selfridges FaceGym multi-sculpt high-performance contouring tool £50 at
  Cult Beauty £53 at Look Fantastic If you’re prone to puffiness when
  travelling, try massaging your face with (clean!) knuckles gently from the
  neck up, using a serum or oil. I like FaceGym’s Face Coach oil for this – and
  even better, use the brand’s gua sha for the massage to aid lymphatic
  drainage. It’s stainless steel, so it will also cool and calm skin. *** A
  toothbrush great for travel Suri electric toothbrush From £63.75 at Suri
  £63.75 at Healf For overnight journeys and travel in general, this is hands
  down my favourite electric toothbrush. Made from sleek aluminium, it’s much
  lighter than other models and can be bought with a UV light charging case that
  neutralises bacteria. The battery lasts for up to 40 days, too. For more, read
  our guide to the best electric toothbrushes tried and tested *** Moisture for
  frazzled hair Sam McKnight Happy Endings nourishing balm mini, 30ml £22 at Sam
  McKnight £22 at Cult Beauty The low humidity on trains and planes can dry out
  hair as well as skin. So, for when ends start to feel frazzled, or if you want
  to give locks a zhoosh before you land, pack Sam McKnight’s multitasking Happy
  Endings balm. It’s one of my hair care ride or dies: it instantly nourishes
  and smoothes, and can also be used to define layers, but it’s not heavy or
  greasy. *** A post-travel breath freshener Selahatin Blue Forever eau
  d’extrait oral, 18.5ml £36 at Niche Beauty If you need a quick breath
  freshen-up, this Selahatin spray looks and tastes luxurious. It contains
  liquorice, which has antibacterial benefits, as well as refreshing citrus and
  peppermint. *** Hayley Spencer is a journalist and editor with 15 years’
