  I can remember many things about the afternoon I told Betsy that she had stage
  IV lung cancer. I can still see how the single ray of sunshine from the
  skylight in the atrium behind us entered the crack between the curtains in her
  hospital room, shooting right through the crystalline IV bag hanging from the
  pole next to her, turning it into a depressing sort of disco ball. I can still
  hear the sardonic laugh we shared about the unwieldy chest tube emerging from
  between her ribs that was slowly re-inflating her lung after a biopsy had
  caused it to partially collapse. But, as her oncologist, what I remember most
  clearly was her outward equanimity about it all. She was 72 years old,
  divorced, fierce and sarcastic. She’d later tell me how caring for her mother
  as she’d slowly declined with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had put
  her “firmly in the quality over quantity camp”. She had already been treated
  for breast cancer, having gone through surgery, radiation and hormonal
  therapies some years before. She knew very well the promises and limitations
  of modern oncology, and that each path had its costs. Hard-earned experience
  meant she harbored few illusions about any of it. I went over the PET scan
  she’d had before her admission to the hospital. Masses in both lungs. “We know
  what that means,” she said, pursing her lips. My job was to provide
  information, I thought then. Her job would be deciding what we did with it.
  “Well, yes, I don’t think we’re looking at something that’s curable.” Betsy
  would later tell me that while she wouldn’t call herself a control freak, she
  felt driven by a deep need to remain in control of her own circumstances. We
  would spend the next two years figuring out what that meant. ••• Two weeks
  later, we went over the biopsy results in my outpatient office. The
  pathologist had finalized a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma; subsequent
  testing had shown that her tumor harbored a significant level of PDL1
  expression. “And what does that mean?” “It means it would be reasonable to
  treat you with immunotherapy alone,” I said, explaining that we could use a
  drug called pembrolizumab to better allow her own immune system to find and
  kill the cancer cells inside of her body. “We don’t have to start with any
  chemotherapy.” “Good, because I’m never going to do any chemotherapy.” I
  nodded, though I’d heard these declarations before from dozens of other
  patients. But when the scans showed progression, and the progression was
  causing pain, and the prospect of one’s death loomed ever closer, red lines
  drawn in the light of better health suddenly didn’t seem so final. “Sure, we
  can talk about that when we get there.” I instinctively recoiled from
  challenging my patients’ values. This was what it meant to give our patients
  autonomy, I thought. She didn’t say anything, but the look in her eyes told me
  what I needed to know. I’d later asked how her previous experience getting
  treated for breast cancer informed her approach to this new diagnosis, how
  she’d come into it with a rare clarity on what she would and would not accept.
  “The only negative that stuck with me from breast cancer was never to get
  married again, because my husband was not supportive.” We laughed. “You know,
  people say, ‘Oh, they fought and fought and fought,’ and I don’t know that I
  agree with that. I don’t ever want to be kept alive. I don’t ever want my life
  to be one day of suffering and fighting after another. I don’t want that.” I
  could appreciate that. I agreed it wasn’t true that the only sane response to
  lived experience was more of it. But I also thought chemotherapy occupied an
  unfair place in the popular imagination. Sometimes, the pain, weight loss and
  weakness that patients and families blamed on paclitaxel or oxaliplatin were
  just as much caused by the cancer itself. And often, in the grieving
  imagination of those left behind, a death from cancer gradually became a death
  from the treatment. Still, there was no denying the toll taken by the
  indefinite treatments we recommended to patients with incurable cancers. “My
  nextdoor neighbor was about 10 years younger than I am and she was diagnosed
  with pancreatic cancer. At the same time, my uncle by marriage was diagnosed
  with a glioblastoma. I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was like, ‘Don’t
  drink the water where we are, you know?’” She paused until I got the joke. “I
  watched both of them, my uncle and my dear friend go from treatment to
  treatment to treatment. Never, quote, “giving up” and being pushed by their
  families to continue treatment. And I thought it was very inhumane. If you’re
  going to extend somebody’s life by a week and a half or six months, and those
  six months are going to be hell, I’m not going to sign up for them.” ••• A
  2016 study had led to pembrolizumab’s approval for a subset of people with
  advanced lung cancer. Nearly half of the patients in the trial responded to
  that drug alone without the use of chemotherapy. And, in a disease where
  survival is often measured in months, nearly a third were still alive five
  years later. On average, the patients in the trial lived about two years – a
  meaningful gain for those who might live only a few months without treatment.
  I talked about this data with Betsy and her family before she eventually
  agreed to undergo therapy. She later told me she appreciated that I’d been
  honest and open about the numbers, that she’d had a good idea from the
  beginning of how long the treatment would be effective. Growing up, Betsy’s
  family called her Big Momma – “and it wasn’t a compliment … it was basically
  implied that I was bossy or needed to have things done my way”. That baseline
  need was further sharpened by her mother’s exacting standards and the
  subsequent responsibilities she took on caring for her brother, who suffered
  from severe mental illness. It further solidified, years later, when she had
  to find ways to make ends meet as a single mother. In an important way, her
  fastidiousness was rooted in the knowledge that so much depended on her doing
  things right the first time. As the decades passed, friends and family learned
  she could be counted on to help them navigate complicated medical decisions
  like choosing a nursing home or arranging a home health aide. Now, she’d draw
  on that energy to get through her own cancer treatment. Over her first few
  months on pembrolizumab, her chest and back were slowly covered with a fine
  red rash that itched like hell – a condition called immune dermatitis, which
  resulted from the same T-cells that were being activated to fight the
  patient’s cancer mistakenly targeting their skin. The itching went from a mild
  annoyance to an around-the-clock obsession that made sleep impossible. Betsy
  herself described her years-long experience with it as “almost torture”. We
  recommended plastic jars full of steroid creams, metal tubes of steroid
  ointments and soothing lotions of varying potency. We also tried an assortment
  of antihistamines without much success. Poring over case reports online, I
  found some data to support the prescription of gabapentin – a medication
  typically used to treat diabetic neuropathy – for her itching. That helped a
  little. She was also getting more and more fatigued. She still worked from
  home part-time, but she’d finish for the day and collapse on her couch,
  sleeping for hours at a time. We checked her thyroid and cortisol levels, both
  of which are commonly affected by immunotherapy. Both normal. We checked her
  blood counts. Nearly normal. I couldn’t find anything to fix. We were
  prisoners of the measurable. I was left recommending her to sleep as much as
  she could and do only as much as her body allowed. Yet despite all of the
  negatives, the treatment was also clearly working to control her cancer’s
  growth. I can recall the feeling of anxious anticipation when I got the
  message that the results of her first scan were ready. It echoed what I’d felt
  in high school when I’d gotten a large envelope in the mail from a college I’d
  applied to – a fragile expectation that contained within it an implicit
  admonition not to get my hopes up. I took a deep breath and clicked on the
  result. Her cancer was shrinking. The response continued at six months out. It
  continued at 12 months. It was difficult to live like that, from scan to scan.
  Not many are equipped to handle that kind of sustained uncertainty. Betsy
  seemed to be doing well enough with it, though. At least that’s what she let
  me see. We felt it was worth it to continue. For now. “I am very good at
  weighing pluses and minuses,” she told me, “but my pluses and minuses can be
  very different than someone else’s.” I wondered how long this new equilibrium
  could last. ••• In the first two years after we diagnosed Betsy’s cancer, I
  wrote 33 progress notes in her chart. That meant I saw her 33 times, an
  average of about once every three weeks. We developed a strange kind of
  intimacy. I didn’t know where she grew up, what her house looked like, what
  her favorite movie was. Yet, I’d seen into her lungs. I knew why she couldn’t
  sleep. I had data that told me how long she might live. I was witnessing her
  facing death. I knew in a very real way what she was about. That vulnerability
  went only one way, however. Though Betsy and my other patients got to know me,
  I was able to hide behind the dry-cleaned fabric of my white coat and the
  emotional remove of my role as doctor. That was how I had been taught to be.
  My patients didn’t need to know about my hangovers, my heartbreaks. They
  didn’t need to know, I told myself, what treatments I’d recommend to my own
  family members. Yet I still think Betsy learned enough about what I was about
  to stick around. I wasn’t as hidden as I thought. There were plenty of
  oncologists in our city. For a patient to stay with me was a choice, the
  implications of which I never took lightly. Our relationship was about more
  than five-year overall survival numbers and maintaining adequate kidney
  function. To be the doctor she needed, I knew I’d have to find a way to keep
  giving her more. ••• In the spring following Betsy’s diagnosis, she was
  admitted to the hospital with bacterial pneumonia. The cough lingered for
  weeks, though she eventually recovered enough to make a trip to Colorado. A
  few months later, she suffered a viral upper respiratory tract infection that
  was soon complicated by another bacterial pneumonia. Her scans became more
  difficult to interpret, the smoothly outlined opacities of her cancer now
  superimposed with the ground glass caused by repeated infections. PET-CT scans
  showed more metabolic activity in the lungs as well, but it wasn’t clear
  whether this was a sign of growing cancer cells or an immune system struggling
  to fight off multiple infections. We spent long visits talking about the
  implications of those hard-to-parse scans, poring over measurements of size,
  of metabolic activity. I tried to provide reasonable explanations for any
  increases, explanations that didn’t involve a growing resistance to the
  therapy that had been so successful for over a year. I wanted to take what I
  knew about her case to tell a story that was reassuring. I couldn’t adhere any
  longer to some imagined ideal of impartiality at odds with what I understood
  it meant to care for another person. I remember one such visit particularly
  well, a little over a year into therapy. The scan we’d done before the
  appointment showed new findings in both breasts. This was not an area that
  lung cancer was known for going, I told her. We couldn’t explain this away.
  She was unmoved. “I’ve had that right breast biopsied a few times since I was
  treated for the breast cancer way back when.” “Still, I’d like you to go see
  the breast surgeon. Get it checked out. There’s a small spot on the PET scan
  in the left breast too, even though we can’t feel anything there.” She went
  under protest. A few weeks later, after talking Betsy into another biopsy, the
  surgeon called me. It was a small cancer on the left side. My colleagues and I
  discussed her case with all the relevant specialists, and we shared our
  recommendations with her. She didn’t want to have surgery and she didn’t want
  to risk an anti-estrogen medication. What was the point of being aggressive
  with treating the breast cancer at all, she wondered, given that it was more
  likely that lung cancer would threaten her life first? Even the medicine
  sounded like too much. She’d taken it for five years following her first
  breast cancer diagnosis nearly a decade ago, and it had made her so tired. The
  pembrolizumab was making her tired enough. We agreed – we would watch it. We’d
  act not to control the cancer, but to control what we would and would not do
  about it. The decision had emerged from Betsy’s own history with breast cancer
  and its treatments. She knew in a very real way what each option would cost
  her. “So what’s going on with my lung cancer, anyway?” Even a change of
  subject couldn’t get us any real relief. One scan pointed to it looking worse,
  another better. I squinted at the pixels on the screen. Maybe if I looked hard
  enough, I thought, I could see what was going on inside those inscrutable
  cells. It was like staring into the sun. “I’d have to say things are
  relatively stable. We’ve been seeing small changes in both ways over the last
  year. Nothing conclusive.” An exhale. A shift in gravity and light. “I don’t
  know how long I can keep doing this.” Bone-deep exhaustion. The rash and
  itching that kept her up at night. Nothing I’d tried had worked. She kept
  refusing oral steroids – the big gun – because prednisone spiked her anxiety
  and wrecked what little sleep she got. I could see what was coming. And while
  I could no longer confine myself to a dry recounting of the facts, I didn’t
  know what else I could say to change Betsy’s mind. What did it mean to fight?
  Wasn’t it more important to ask what we were fighting for? ••• August in
  Houston. A hot, hot afternoon. The humid air so heavy it could be cut into
  blocks and stored. That day, nearly two years into her treatment, Betsy told
  me she couldn’t work any longer, couldn’t do anything after noon but nap and
  lie on her couch. When I think about that appointment now, nearly a year
  later, it seems delusional that I tried so desperately to convince her to
  change her mind after she went on to tell me she didn’t want any more
  infusions. But I was motivated, I think, by a need to move beyond a
  dispassionate recitation of facts and options. I wanted to help her make a
  choice that was consistent with what mattered most to her, especially if it
  wasn’t obvious at first. It was a transition that Drs Linda and Ezekiel
  Emanuel had written about in a landmark 1992 examination of the doctor-patient
  relationship they had published in the Journal of the American Medical
  Association, describing how clinicians might move from a purely informative
  mode to what they termed a deliberative one. But I didn’t know any of that
  then. I just wanted her to leave my clinic without any regrets. So I tried to
  talk her out of her decision. She wasn’t in the hospital, after all. She’d
  just traveled across the country for her stepdaughter’s wedding. She was
  living alone and independently in her own home. Her last scans showed that the
  cancer wasn’t growing. The patients in the trial had each received three years
  of Keytruda, and she’d be stopping short of two. Would she take a break from
  treatment and restart in a few months when she was feeling better? I asked.
  No. Would she take a break and consider chemotherapy? Also no. Her daughter
  Lindsey later told me that she had made the decision to stop therapy with the
  firm expectation that the end of her life would soon follow. She’d lived with
  a sense of fatalism since her breast cancer diagnosis; both of her parents
  hadn’t made it to their 80s. She’d helped so many navigate their final weeks
  and months, and the knowledge of death’s inevitability was never far from her
  mind. Her sister Leslie shared with me that she also had a sense that the
  treatment had bought her enough time to get her affairs in order. Now that she
  knew she’d done all she could to make sure her children would be taken care of
  financially, she felt she could let go. When, against her expectations, she
  made it to fall, she planned for Thanksgiving to be her grand goodbye. Family
  from across the country flew to Houston to be with her, and everything was
  arranged just so. But then she made it to Hanukah, then New Year’s. She
  continued to feel well enough; she was still working; the scans showed no
  growth. Lindsey tried to remind her mother about how the data showed that a
  small fraction of patients had made it to five years with something like the
  therapy she’d gotten. “She goes back and forth between being very fatalistic,
  like where I’m dying imminently … to ‘I’m not that bad, back off, you’re not
  my mother.’” She’d crested the hill, taken her hands off the handlebars,
  entrusted herself to what fate had in store. Her final act of control was to
  relinquish it. Maybe she thought it was the choice that would best ensure the
  kind of death she wanted. But when February rolled around and she was still
  going strong, Lindsey had to finally ask, “OK, we need to start talking about
  your birthday. We’re running out of time. Do you want this party or not?” •••
  On an unseasonably cool May afternoon, I joined Betsy’s family and friends to
  celebrate her 75th birthday in her back yard, where we shared memories over
  lemonade and fajitas. When we’d stopped the pembrolizumab nine months before,
  none of us had known if this celebration was in the cards. Now, we sat
  together, watching the sun set over the neatly manicured flower beds and the
  precisely arranged folding tables. Drinks were arrayed on the sideboard in the
  dining room, and trays of tortillas lay ready in the kitchen. Being on the
  treatment had made this perfect night possible. Coming off the treatment also
  had. When I’d told her I wanted to write about her story, Betsy said that she
  supported the idea. She wanted her family to understand why she’d made the
  choice that she had. I asked her how her relationships with those closest to
  her had changed in the months since she’d stopped therapy. “Well, everybody is
  making their pilgrimages. You don’t have to lift a finger, or you can just sit
  in your house and people can come, and then when it’s time for them to go,
  they can go home.” But, for now, it wasn’t time to go home yet, not for
  another few hours. When faced with serious illness, I think we all want to
  reach that state of balance in which we neither welcome death nor push it
  away. Betsy had come closer to that equilibrium than most, and she’d done that
  by being true to herself. As much as she still expected the end of her life
  was near, that didn’t mean she wouldn’t celebrate it while she still could.
  The cake was brought out of the kitchen, and as we sang, circled around, I
  read the inscription in icing – “Happy Birthday, Bestsy” it said. Her sister
  said the misspelling had been intentional. On this night, so perfectly
  planned, we all needed a little reminder that some things in these beautiful
  lives of ours would always remain just beyond our ability to control them.

The decision had emerged from Betsy’s own history with breast cancer and its treatments. She knew in a very real way what each option would cost her. “So what’s going on with my lung cancer, anyway?” Even a change of subject couldn’t get us any real relief. One scan pointed to it looking worse, another better. I squinted at the pixels on the screen. Maybe if I looked hard enough, I thought, I could see what was going on inside those inscrutable cells. It was like staring into the sun. “I’d have to say things are relatively stable. We’ve been seeing small changes in both ways over the last year. Nothing conclusive.” An exhale. A shift in gravity and light. “I don’t know how long I can keep doing this.” Bone-deep exhaustion. The rash and itching that kept her up at night. Nothing I’d tried had worked. She kept refusing oral steroids – the big gun – because prednisone spiked her anxiety and wrecked what little sleep she got. I could see what was coming. And while I could no longer confine myself to a dry recounting of the facts, I didn’t know what else I could say to change Betsy’s mind. What did it mean to fight? Wasn’t it more important to ask what we were fighting for? ••• August in Houston. A hot, hot afternoon. The humid air so heavy it could be cut into blocks and stored. That day, nearly two years into her treatment, Betsy told me she couldn’t work any longer, couldn’t do anything after noon but nap and lie on her couch. When I think about that appointment now, nearly a year later, it seems delusional that I tried so desperately to convince her to change her mind after she went on to tell me she didn’t want any more infusions. But I was motivated, I think, by a need to move beyond a dispassionate recitation of facts and options. I wanted to help her make a choice that was consistent with what mattered most to her, especially if it wasn’t obvious at first. It was a transition that Drs Linda and Ezekiel Emanuel had written about in a landmark 1992 examination of the doctor-patient relationship they had published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, describing how clinicians might move from a purely informative mode to what they termed a deliberative one. But I didn’t know any of that then. I just wanted her to leave my clinic without any regrets. So I tried to talk her out of her decision. She wasn’t in the hospital, after all. She’d just traveled across the country for her stepdaughter’s wedding. She was living alone and independently in her own home. Her last scans showed that the cancer wasn’t growing. The patients in the trial had each received three years of Keytruda, and she’d be stopping short of two. Would she take a break from treatment and restart in a few months when she was feeling better? I asked. No. Would she take a break and consider chemotherapy? Also no. Her daughter Lindsey later told me that she had made the decision to stop therapy with the firm expectation that the end of her life would soon follow. She’d lived with a sense of fatalism since her breast cancer diagnosis; both of her parents hadn’t made it to their 80s. She’d helped so many navigate their final weeks and months, and the knowledge of death’s inevitability was never far from her mind. Her sister Leslie shared with me that she also had a sense that the treatment had bought her enough time to get her affairs in order. Now that she knew she’d done all she could to make sure her children would be taken care of financially, she felt she could let go. When, against her expectations, she made it to fall, she planned for Thanksgiving to be her grand goodbye. Family from across the country flew to Houston to be with her, and everything was arranged just so. But then she made it to Hanukah, then New Year’s. She continued to feel well enough; she was still working; the scans showed no growth. Lindsey tried to remind her mother about how the data showed that a small fraction of patients had made it to five years with something like the therapy she’d gotten. “She goes back and forth between being very fatalistic, like where I’m dying imminently … to ‘I’m not that bad, back off, you’re not my mother.’” She’d crested the hill, taken her hands off the handlebars, entrusted herself to what fate had in store. Her final act of control was to relinquish it. Maybe she thought it was the choice that would best ensure the kind of death she wanted. But when February rolled around and she was still going strong, Lindsey had to finally ask, “OK, we need to start talking about your birthday. We’re running out of time. Do you want this party or not?” ••• On an unseasonably cool May afternoon, I joined Betsy’s family and friends to celebrate her 75th birthday in her back yard, where we shared memories over lemonade and fajitas. When we’d stopped the pembrolizumab nine months before, none of us had known if this celebration was in the cards. Now, we sat together, watching the sun set over the neatly manicured flower beds and the precisely arranged folding tables. Drinks were arrayed on the sideboard in the dining room, and trays of tortillas lay ready in the kitchen. Being on the treatment had made this perfect night possible. Coming off the treatment also had. When I’d told her I wanted to write about her story, Betsy said that she supported the idea. She wanted her family to understand why she’d made the choice that she had. I asked her how her relationships with those closest to her had changed in the months since she’d stopped therapy. “Well, everybody is making their pilgrimages. You don’t have to lift a finger, or you can just sit in your house and people can come, and then when it’s time for them to go, they can go home.” But, for now, it wasn’t time to go home yet, not for another few hours. When faced with serious illness, I think we all want to reach that state of balance in which we neither welcome death nor push it away. Betsy had come closer to that equilibrium than most, and she’d done that by being true to herself. As much as she still expected the end of her life was near, that didn’t mean she wouldn’t celebrate it while she still could. The cake was brought out of the kitchen, and as we sang, circled around, I read the inscription in icing – “Happy Birthday, Bestsy” it said. Her sister said the misspelling had been intentional. On this night, so perfectly planned, we all needed a little reminder that some things in these beautiful lives of ours would always remain just beyond our ability to control them.
