  Mikel Arteta has backed Eberechi Eze to make an impression on his debut as
  Arsenal prepare to face Liverpool on Sunday without several key attacking
  players including Bukayo Saka. Arteta is, however, close to having a new
  defensive option in Piero Hincapié after loan terms were agreed with Bayer
  Leverkusen. The England forward Saka will miss the trip to Anfield after
  picking up a hamstring injury against Leeds last Saturday, although Arteta was
  hopeful the winger could be back after the international break. The Arsenal
  manager also confirmed Kai Havertz had undergone surgery on a knee problem
  that will keep him out for several weeks. Martin Ødegaard and Leandro Trossard
  are major doubts for the game against the champions. Ødegaard was named in
  Norway’s squad for their World Cup qualifiers but has not trained since
  sustaining a shoulder injury in the 5-0 win over Leeds. Arteta said there was
  a chance his captain could play against Liverpool but believes Eze, who scored
  winners for Crystal Palace at Anfield in April 2024 and in May’s FA Cup final
  against Manchester City, is eager to make an impact after his arrival for a
  fee worth up to £67.5m last weekend. “I think he’s the type of player that
  loves those scenarios and those moments,” the manager said. “I think the
  moment he starts to play, we will see how the team will react and what
  connections will flourish from his interventions. I’m very confident that he’s
  played in the league for so many years. “We have to put him in the positions
  and scenarios where he can deliver those moments which are the reason why we
  brought him here: to give us something different, something unexpected, and we
  will adapt to more what is necessary as we know the outcome of that is really
  big.” Arsenal agreed a deal with Bayer Leverkusen to sign Hincapié on an
  initial loan, with an option to make the Ecuador defender’s move permanent
  next summer for €52m (£45m). Hincapié, who is understood to have already
  agreed personal terms for his move to north London, is expected to complete
  his medical over the weekend before becoming Arsenal’s eighth signing of the
  summer. His impending arrival is likely to lead to the departure of Jakub
  Kiwior to Porto in a loan deal that includes an obligation for the Poland
  defender to make the move permanently next summer for up to €27m, with
  interest also building in Oleksandr Zinchenko Arteta’s side have already spent
  more than £250m on new players in this transfer window and Arsenal had been
  looking to structure their move for Hincapié as an initial loan so they do not
  fall foul of Uefa’s regulations on financial fair play. They are believed to
  have discussed the deal with Leverkusen officials on Friday and reached an
  agreement over the 23-year-old, who had a release clause of €60m but expressed
  his wish to leave. Hincapié, who can play as a left-sided centre‑back or
  left-back, joined the Bundesliga club from the Argentinian side Talleres in
  2021 and has 46 caps for his country. Kiwior had interest from Crystal Palace
  but preferred to join Porto, who have agreed to pay around £2m to take the
  25-year-old on loan for the season before he completes his permanent move.
  Arsenal did not want to sanction his departure until they had secured a
  replacement and are now stepping up their efforts to offload other fringe
  players before Monday’s transfer deadline. Marseille have enquired about
  signing Zinchenko, although the Ukrainian’s wages could be a stumbling block.
  Fulham and Palace have both been in talks over Reiss Nelson, while Stuttgart
  are expected to step up their efforts to sign the Portugal midfielder Fábio
  Vieira before the end of the window. Ben White and Christian Nørgaard are also
  struggling to be available for the Liverpool game as Arsenal’s injury concerns
  have continued from last season, when they were without Saka, Ødegaard and
  Havertz for lengthy spells. Arteta revealed that Arsenal had been looking into
  why they have been dealing with so many absences and said they were
  “continually monitoring and evolving the needs of the players and the
  schedule”. He said Saka’s repeated problems were a big concern. The forward
  was out for more than three months after surgery on his right hamstring in
  December and has picked up the latest injury in his other leg. “He does not
  need surgery,” said Arteta. “It’s not as bad as the previous one. He felt
  something, so he will be out for a couple of weeks. But it is obviously a
  concern, a big one, especially when we talk about a sprinter and a player that
  gets into that zone very often in a football match, who needs that burst, that
  change of rhythm of pace to be as threatening as possible. “But we will learn
  again as to why it happened and make him stronger. Unfortunately injuries are
  part of a career. He hasn’t had that many, to be fair, with the amount of
  games that he has played at his age but it is something that we want to
  eradicate.”
