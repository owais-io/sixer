  A prominent Al Jazeera journalist who had previously been threatened by Israel
  has been killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike. Anas
  al-Sharif, who was one of Al Jazeera’s most recognisable faces in Gaza, was
  killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza
  City on Sunday night. His funeral was held on Monday morning. Seven people in
  total were killed in the attack, including al-Sharif, Al Jazeera correspondent
  Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and
  Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster. The Israel Defense
  Force admitted the strike, claiming the reporter had “served as the head of a
  terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organisation and was responsible for
  advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF forces”. It claimed
  it had intelligence and documents found in Gaza as proof but rights advocates
  said he had been targeted for his frontline reporting on the Gaza war and that
  Israel’s claim lacked evidence. Calling al-Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest
  journalists,” Al Jazeera said the attack was “a desperate attempt to silence
  voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza.” Last month Israeli IDF
  spokesperson Avichai Adraee shared a video of al-Sharif on X and accused him
  of being a member of Hamas’ military wing. At the time the UN special
  rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, called it “an unsubstantiated
  claim” and a “blatant assault on journalists”. In July, al-Sharif told the
  Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that he lived with the “feeling that I
  could be bombed and martyred at any moment”. After the attack, the CPJ said it
  was “appalled” to learn of the journalists’ deaths. “Israel’s pattern of
  labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises
  serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said CPJ
  regional director Sara Qudah. “Journalists are civilians and must never be
  targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.” The
  Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate condemned what it described as a “bloody
  crime” of assassination. In January this year, after a ceasefire between Hamas
  and Israel, al-Sharif drew widespread attention when, during a live broadcast,
  he removed his body armour while surrounded by dozens of Gaza residents
  celebrating the temporary halt in hostilities. A few minutes before his death,
  al-Sharif posted on X: “Breaking: Intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment
  using ‘fire belts’ is hitting the eastern and southern areas of Gaza City.” In
  a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which
  was posted to al-Sharif’s X account after his death, the reporter said that he
  had “lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many
  times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without
  distortion or falsification.” “Allah may bear witness against those who stayed
  silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose
  hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing
  nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year
  and a half,” he continued. The 28-year-old leaves behind a wife and two small
  children. His father was killed by an Israeli strike on the family home in
  Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza City in December 2023. At the time al-Sharif said
  he would continue to report and refused to leave northern Gaza. Another Al
  Jazeera journalist in Gaza, Hani Mahmoud, said: “This is perhaps the hardest
  thing I’m reporting about the past 22 months. I’m not far from al-Shifa
  hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that
  took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa hospital. “I could
  see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it
  was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa hospital.” Al-Sharif
  and his colleagues have been reporting from Gaza since the beginning of the
  conflict. “It’s important to highlight that this attack is just a week after
  an Israeli military official directly accused Anas and directly ran a campaign
  of incitement on Al Jazeera and correspondents on the ground because of their
  work, because of their relentless reporting on the starvation and the famine
  and the malnutrition,” Mahmoud added. Israel has killed multiple Al Jazeera
  journalists and members of their families, including Hossam Shabat, who was
  killed in March, and Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were
  killed in August. Chief correspondent Wael al Dahdouh’s wife, son, daughter
  and grandson were killed in October 2023 and he himself was injured in an
  attack weeks later that killed Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa. Israel,
  which does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza and which has targeted
  local reporters, has killed 237 journalists since the war started on 7 October
  2023, according to Gaza’s government media office. The Committee to Protect
  Journalists said at least 186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza
  conflict. Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists. With Reuters and
