  It took more than 100 years after universities were established in Australia
  for an Indigenous student to graduate. Margaret Williams-Weir, a Gumbaynggirr
  and Malera Bundjalung woman, completed a diploma in physical education at the
  University of Melbourne in 1959. Since Williams-Weir, more than 1,400
  Indigenous students have graduated from the sandstone university, and a record
  536 were enrolled in 2023. But that is still only 1.27% of students, compared
  with 3.8% of the general population who are Indigenous. The university has
  also failed to reach its targets for Indigenous staff. Amid efforts to improve
  Indigenous representation, the university has released the second volume of
  Dhoombak Goobgoowana – translated as “truth-telling” in the Woi Wurrung
  language of the traditional owners of the land on which the university was
  built. The first volume, published last year, laid bare the dark side of the
  university’s history, revealing how Nazi apologists, massacre perpetrators,
  grave robbers, racists and eugenicists had been celebrated as hugely
  influential heroes of academia. The second volume, Voice, does not shy away
  from the the university’s troubled historical relationship with Indigenous
  people, but shifts its focus to stories of resilience, resistance and reform,
  which its editors hope will contribute to reconciliation. The deputy
  vice-chancellor (Indigenous) , Prof Barry Judd, says Voice is about “who gets
  to speak, who gets heard, and what it takes to create space for Indigenous
  leadership in systems not built for us”. “This volume documents progress, but
  also calls us to go further,” he says. “It is both a record of progress and a
  foundation for ongoing cultural transformation.” The work was commissioned as
  part of the university’s commitment to truth telling. Both volumes were
  submitted to the Yoorrook Justice Commission, the first formal truth-telling
  process into injustices experienced by Indigenous people in Victoria. Prof
  Marcia Langton, who co-wrote and edited the book, says the works of Indigenous
  staff and students to turn the university towards respect for Indigenous
  knowledge “echo across history and continue to inspire”. When Langton was
  hired in 2000 to construct an undergraduate program in Australian Indigenous
  studies, she was the first Aboriginal professor at the university and among
  only a handful of full-time Indigenous academic staff. She says Dhoombak
  Goobgoowana would have been “impossible to write” when her tenure began.
  “There were no Indigenous studies programs at all,” she says. “Today we are
  the only university in the world that has reckoned with its Indigenous history
  and its engagement with Indigenous people honestly and truthfully. “Before we
  were able to do this, it was a matter of great shame to many Indigenous people
  that our university had this past and didn’t acknowledge it.” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email White students in blackface When Williams-Weir began at
  the university, campus racism was overt. In 1951, the book recounts,
  first-year students were greeted at the university’s official welcome by white
  students in blackface dressed as “spear-waving ‘aborigines’”. Six years later,
  when a fundraising body for Indigenous tertiary education, Abschol, advertised
  it would sell buttons, a group of students hung an effigy of an Indigenous
  person from a tree outside Union House. An article published in the student
  newspaper Farrago in 1959 mocking Abschol’s work said attempts to offer
  charity to Indigenous people produced an “apathetic, disease-ridden, violent,
  metho-drinking community who have no other values than the satisfaction of
  their desires”. Abschol students’ own efforts also demonstrated a limited
  connection to the Indigenous community at the university. Their float for the
  1956 Moomba parade featured five white students who had blackened their skin
  and wore headdresses taken from communities in far north Queensland. This was
  the environment the university’s first Aboriginal liaison officer, Destiny
  Deacon, entered when she began her role in 1975. She resigned a year later
  over “intractable disagreements” about her autonomy and under-resourcing.
  Deacon went on to complete a bachelor of arts degree in 1979 and became a
  celebrated artist, broadcaster, academic and political activist, but during
  her tenure she came up against persistently racist ideas about Aboriginal and
  Torres Strait Islanders. Launching the first Black Week of the Students
  Representative Council in 1974, Deacon lamented: “Some of us think the
  dishonest acquisition of our land by the whites happened because we, at the
  time, had no concept of the white man’s irrational notion of his divine right
  to plunder the lands and property of human beings whom he considers to be
  ‘primitive’, ‘barbaric’ or ‘uncivilised’,” she told the crowd. “They conned us
  into believing that they were superior”. Langton says Deacon did an
  “extraordinary job” supporting the students and “breaking down the walls of
  exclusion” at the university. “[Her speech] represents the tipping point from
  the view of Aboriginal people as primitives, which had been the subject of so
  much pseudoscience at the university,” she says. “Change really began to
  accelerate from the advocacy of a few enlightened individuals.” Despite the
  efforts of students such as Deacon, the university’s colonial past remained
  evidenced in the names of buildings promoting eugenicists, and tucked behind
  closed doors. In 2002, a collection of more than 800 Indigenous remains was
  discovered by chance in a locked basement storeroom. The remains had been
  collected by Richard Berry, a professor of anatomy at the university in the
  early 1900s and prominent eugenicist. He was one of multiple academics who
  took remains from Indigenous communities as late as the 1950s. After
  amendments to the Victorian government’s Relics Preservation Act in the 1980s,
  Gunditjmara elder Uncle Jim Berg arrived at the UoM with the legal injunction
  to repatriate the stolen items. The book recounts Berg’s recollection that the
  then vice-chancellor, David Caro, met him in his office and shouted: “Who in
  the hell do you think you are, taking on the University of Melbourne?” A
  collection of about 800 Indigenous remains, excavated from gravesites on the
  Murray River by George Murray Black, was returned. But despite the injunction
  explicitly including Berry’s collection as well as Black’s, it would sit in
  the Medical Building for another two decades, and even now families are
  waiting for their ancestors to be repatriated. A subsequent audit by the
  university found about two dozen Aboriginal remains and cultural artefacts,
  including the skull of a tribal leader stored alongside animal specimens and
  Aboriginal stone artefacts stored in a service duct. There were some academics
  who championed Indigenous knowledge, including Dr Leonhard Adam, Baldwin
  Spencer and Donald Thomson, whose collection consists of more than 10,000
  Indigenous objects. This year, the university’s Potter Museum unveiled the
  jestingly titled exhibition 65,000 Years: A Short History of Australian Art,
  featuring more than 400 artworks and cultural objects from the university’s
  collection, many of which had rarely been seen by the public, including
  segments of Thomson’s collection. Co-curated by Langton, the exhibition
  confronts Australia’s colonial history and the process of collection from
  Indigenous lands, as well as the belated acceptance of Aboriginal art into the
  fine art canon. Langton says academics such as Thomson were “collecting vast
  amounts of Aboriginal cultural heritage, but after they retired or passed,
  those collections sat in storerooms and were rarely seen by the public … Our
  exhibition puts their collections in their historical context.” This,
  co-editor Dr James Waghorne says, is what a history of inclusion looks like:
  “Imperfect, overdue and then often painfully slow, but marked by stories of
  courage and hope. “Dhoombak Goobgoowana traces a series of beginnings,” he
  says. “When academic leaders repudiated race science with growing insistence,
  when pioneering Indigenous students made the most of their chances, and their
  allies in student clubs and societies championed their cause. “When the first
  staff broke through, and when the university established partnerships with
  Indigenous groups beyond its gates.”
