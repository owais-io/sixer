  An unattributed missile is launched at the US, setting off a desperate effort
  inside the White House to determine who fired it and how to respond: not the
  latest news headline but the premise of Kathryn Bigelow’s political thriller A
  House of Dynamite, which will premiere at the Venice film festival. The film
  marks a return to the large-scale, geopolitically attuned storytelling that
  made Bigelow one of the most decorated directors of her generation. Few
  film-makers have been so consistently engaged with the faultlines of American
  power as Bigelow. In 2008’s The Hurt Locker she charted the psychological
  intensity of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. Four years later, in Zero Dark
  Thirty, she dramatised the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden. Her latest
  film turns to a different, though no less urgent, anxiety: the prospect of
  nuclear catastrophe. “I grew up in an era when hiding under your school desk
  was considered the go-to protocol for surviving an atomic bomb,” Bigelow, 73,
  said before the premiere. “Today, the danger has only escalated. Multiple
  nations possess enough nuclear weapons to end civilisation within minutes. And
  yet, there’s a kind of collective numbness – a quiet normalisation of the
  unthinkable.” Bigelow was born in San Carlos, California, in 1951, the
  daughter of a factory manager and a librarian. By her own account she was a
  shy child, drawn to art as an outlet. She studied painting at the San
  Francisco Art Institute before moving to New York, where she immersed herself
  in conceptual art and studied under Susan Sontag at Columbia. “Painting is a
  bit elitist,” she later said. “Film crosses culture and class.” Her first
  feature, The Loveless (1981), co-directed with Monty Montgomery and starring a
  young Willem Dafoe, gave little indication of the trajectory to come. In the
  1980s and 1990s she built a reputation directing cult thrillers that inverted
  genre conventions, including the vampire western Near Dark (1987), the cop
  drama Blue Steel (1990), and the surfer-heist thriller Point Break (1991),
  which starred Keanu Reeves and was later hailed as a cult classic in action
  cinema. Bigelow’s pivot toward historical, politically grounded narratives
  came with K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), a cold war drama about a group of men
  aboard the Soviet Union’s first nuclear-powered submarine, starring Harrison
  Ford and Liam Neeson. But her real breakthrough did not come until 2008 with
  The Hurt Locker, a film she partly self-financed and shot under punishing
  conditions in Jordan, where temperatures reached 54C. The story of three
  soldiers disarming roadside bombs, written by the journalist Mark Boal, won
  six Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. Bigelow became
  the first woman to win the directing prize, beating her ex-husband, James
  Cameron, who was nominated for Avatar. Until Bigelow, only three women had
  been nominated for best director in nearly a century of Academy Awards. In the
  years since, just two others – Chloé Zhao and Jane Campion – have joined her.
  But Bigelow resisted the moment’s symbolism and has repeatedly rejected overt
  labels. In interviews, she paraphrased Gertrude Stein – “A filmmaker is a
  filmmaker is a filmmaker” – and said her aptitude was not to “break gender
  roles or gender traditions” but to “explore and push the medium”. Still,
  critics have pointed to the undercurrents of masculinity and power in her
  films, which tend to centre on themes of violence. In 2010, Time Magazine paid
  tribute to her ability to capture “the intense, skewered madness of war and
  the distortion in men’s souls”, naming her as one of the 100 most influential
  people in the world. Bigelow’s follow-up in 2012, Zero Dark Thirty, revisited
  the US’s “war on terror” with a procedural account of the CIA’s pursuit of Bin
  Laden, starring Jessica Chastain. The film was a critical and commercial
  success but provoked controversy for its depiction of “enhanced interrogation”
  techniques such as waterboarding. Anti-torture activists staged protests
  outside its premiere in Washington DC. Bigelow defended the work, writing in
  the Los Angeles Times: “Depiction is not endorsement. It does seem illogical
  to me to make a case against torture by ignoring or denying the role it played
  in US counter-terrorism policy and practices.” The director also described
  herself as a “lifelong pacifist” and said such sentiments would be more
  appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered US policies. In the
  decade since Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow’s output has been sparse. She directed
  Detroit in 2017, a harrowing account of the 1967 Detroit uprisings, and
  produced the Netflix documentary Cartel Land in 2015, which won an Emmy. That
  long gap is partly what makes A House of Dynamite so highly anticipated.
  Produced by Netflix and starring Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts,
  Greta Lee and Jared Harris, it unfolds through the perspective of White House
  officials grappling with an imminent ballistic threat. It will premiere in
  competition in Venice before a limited theatrical release and a rollout on
  Netflix on 24 October. “I wanted to make a film that confronts this paradox –
  to explore the madness of a world that lives under the constant shadow of
  annihilation, yet rarely speaks of it,” Bigelow said. For a director who has
  long been drawn to life’s toughest adventures, including once climbing
  Kilimanjaro, it marks the resumption of a career defined by confronting some
  of the world’s most volatile flashpoints.
