  Australia still expect Pat Cummins to be available for the first Ashes Test,
  even as the captain deals with stress in his back. The star quick will miss
  the upcoming T20 tour of New Zealand and back-to-back home white-ball series
  against India due to lumbar bone stress. Cummins has been cleared of stress
  fractures after a routine scan had earlier picked up an issue, but will be
  racing the clock to be fit for Australia’s opening Test in Perth against
  England starting on 21 November. Chairman of selectors George Bailey has
  backed Cummins to lead Australia out at Optus Stadium to begin the defence of
  the urn. “There still feels like there’s plenty of time,” Bailey said,
  referencing 80 days until the Ashes starts. “On the back of the scan, there’ll
  just be continued rehab and monitoring around that. Full expectation [is] that
  Pat would be right to go come the first Test.” Cummins was expected to skip
  the tour of New Zealand but his preparations for the Ashes have been disrupted
  with the 32-year-old ruled out of the three match one-day series against India
  in October. Ahead of finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter If
  Cummins is not able to prove his fitness in time to face England, Australia
  have captaincy and bowling options to cover him. Scott Boland would almost
  certainly be called into the pace attack, with the Victorian spectacularly
  taking a hat-trick in Australia’s previous Test against West Indies in July.
  Former skipper Steve Smith has also covered for Cummins numerous times since
  the pacer became Test captain in November 2021. Cummins missed a Test during
  the 2021-22 Ashes due to Covid-19 protocols, while he didn’t play in the final
  two games of Australia’s tour of India in 2023 due to the death of his mother.
  “Despite this planned de-load period, Cummins has experienced some ongoing
  lower back pain following the West Indies Test tour,” a Cricket Australia
  spokesperson said. “Further investigation has identified a level of lumbar
  bone stress that will require further management over the coming months.”
  Left-arm quick Mitchell Starc has meanwhile announced his retirement from
  international T20s in a bid to preserve his Test career. Starc’s 79 wickets in
  65 T20Is places him second on the all-time list for Australia behind Adam
  Zampa. “Test cricket is and has always been my highest priority,” Starc said.
  “I have loved every minute of every T20 game I have played for Australia,
  particularly the 2021 World Cup, not just because we won but the incredible
  group and the fun along the way. “Looking ahead to an away Indian Test tour,
  the Ashes and an ODI World Cup in 2027, I feel this is my best way forward to
  remain fresh, fit and at my best for those campaigns.” Australia’s squad to
  tour New Zealand for three T20s includes left-armer Ben Dwarshuis, alongside
  Josh Hazlewood and Sean Abbott. Mitch Owen returns after being concussed in
  the second game against South Africa with Matt Short named after recovering
  from a side strain. Experienced all-rounder Marcus Stoinis also returns to the
  squad for the series starting on 1 October. Australia T20 squad Mitchell Marsh
  (capt), Sean Abbott, Xavier Bartlett, Tim David, Ben Dwarshuis, Josh
  Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Matt Kuhnemann, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell
  Owen, Matthew Short, Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa.
