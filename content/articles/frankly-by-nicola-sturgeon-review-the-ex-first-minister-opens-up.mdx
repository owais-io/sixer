  When the title of Nicola Sturgeon’s memoir, Frankly, was first announced, I
  had my doubts. Partly, of course, it was a touching nod to her late friend,
  the comic Janey Godley. Godley’s viral Twitter voiceovers of the first
  minister of Scotland’s press conferences always ended with the catchphrase:
  “Frank, get the door!” As a reporter covering her decade in power, however,
  I’d always found her to be a master of the lengthy, lawyerly obfuscation and
  the disarming but consequence-free apology. Would she really engage with the
  questions that overshadowed the final years of her leadership until her shock
  resignation in 2023? Questions about Alex Salmond’s sexual harassment
  investigation, the Scottish government’s secrecy during the pandemic, the
  toxic legacy of her gender recognition reforms, the stalled delivery of some
  of her flagship policy pledges, not to mention independence itself. And what
  about that rumoured lesbian affair? With her ex-husband, former SNP chief
  executive Peter Murrell, currently awaiting trial for alleged embezzlement of
  party funds, that topic is rendered conveniently off-limits under contempt of
  court rules. But that doesn’t mean readers will be able to dispel from their
  minds images of the famous blue police tent planted in her garden. Following
  her own arrest and release without charge in June 2023, she remained subject
  to investigation as part of the probe into SNP finances for almost two years.
  This book was written during those dark days (she was formally told there
  would be no further action in March this year). But first, Frankly takes us
  back to a council flat in the former mining village of Dreghorn, Ayrshire.
  There, a young Nicola identified with tomboyish George from the Famous Five,
  worried constantly about her dad joining the swelling ranks of the unemployed,
  and broke up with her primary school best friend because she wanted to spend
  more time on her homework. She identifies the fundamental contradiction that
  would propel her: “Alongside shyness, crippling lack of confidence and a
  dreadful fear of failure was a burning ambition, a drive to succeed, a craving
  to be ‘seen’.” It’s a psychic schism that is evident throughout the book. When
  she starts canvassing as a teenager, “somehow the girl who found it almost
  impossible to chat with people she knew was able to stand on the doorsteps of
  complete strangers and ask them to vote SNP”. And later, as Sturgeon and her
  party soared in popularity after the 2014 independence referendum, she became
  “scared that my public persona was now so far removed from my private self
  that I wouldn’t be able to live up to her”. One is left in no doubt about the
  sheer force of will required to be Nicola Sturgeon, and how very good she
  became at hiding that struggle. There are some moments of bracing honesty. She
  reveals she came close to having a breakdown after giving evidence at the UK
  Covid inquiry. It was intolerable to her “being confronted with everything my
  worst critics wanted people to believe of me”. I can’t think of another
  politician of her stature who’d describe themselves on the floor of their home
  office, gripped by a panic attack as they struggled to edit a crucial policy
  document – in this case the Scottish government’s white paper on independence.
  And a lengthy passage on her pregnancy loss, in which she writes about her
  lingering guilt and shares the name she had chosen for the baby, Isla, is
  almost unbearably intimate. As you might expect from a book-lover like
  Sturgeon, she is an entertaining storyteller, with a good eye for detail –
  such as the relief she felt on discovering a dead fly in her restaurant meal
  at her first SNP conference, meaning she didn’t have to pay for it from the
  £40 her cash-strapped parents had given her to last the weekend. She also
  enjoys a plot twist: after a thorough take-down of the much-recycled rumour
  that she had an affair with the female French ambassador, she writes that “the
  nature of the insult was water off a duck’s back … I have never considered
  sexuality, my own included, to be binary”. It’s startling to read her account
  of the tension and hostility she claims characterised her relationship with
  Alex Salmond long before the public split that resulted from her government’s
  handling of sexual harassment allegations made against him by two civil
  servants. (These later formed part of his criminal trial on 13 counts of
  sexual assault, of which he was acquitted in March 2020.) The pattern of
  behaviour she lays out – bouncing her into standing for parliament before she
  felt ready, overriding her concerns about releasing the Lockerbie bomber on
  compassionate grounds, taunting her about her caution on pushing for another
  independence referendum – comes across as little short of bullying. Of course
  this cannot be tested against Salmond’s own recollection because of his sudden
  death last October, and will further infuriate those who believe those sexual
  assault allegations were a conspiracy confected by Sturgeon and her allies, a
  theory she takes apart piece by piece. She says she “agonised” about “stirring
  up pain for his wife and family” but concluded “I cannot let what he said
  stand unchallenged”. It’s a trade-off that makes sense from someone who
  recognises what an “increasingly polarising figure” she had become – indeed
  anything she writes now will be understood from whichever side of the various
  fissures readers locate themselves on, be they Scottish independence, Alex
  Salmond or gender. On that issue she also stands her ground: where plenty of
  others have shifted position since the supreme court ruling on biological sex,
  she refuses to, while offering her most conciliatory words yet over her
  “complacency” about other women’s worries. What’s clear is the utter
  discombobulation she felt at having been earlier feted as a role model -
  “living up to the honour of being the first female incumbent of my office
  became almost an obsession”, she writes - only to be decried by some gender
  critical campaigners as a “destroyer of women’s rights”. At one point,
  Sturgeon observes that “whenever a man is alleged to have done something wrong
  some people’s first instinct is to find a woman to blame”. Right enough, but
  there are also legitimate questions about how someone in a position of power
  and leadership could be so ignorant of someone as close to her as Salmond was.
  Neither does she explain why the women who brought the original harassment
  complaints against Salmond described being left without any support by the
  Scottish government she led. She fails to reflect on how having a married
  couple at the very top of the SNP for more than a decade impacted the party,
  encouraging the apparently lax governance so many colleagues complained about.
  She says she “hated” the cultish focus on her as an individual, particularly
  after 2015, but doesn’t explain why it was allowed to continue. Nor does she
  address the lack of succession planning for her eventual departure. Despite
  the book’s promise of candour, it seems like Sturgeon is only willing to
  entertain her readers’ curiosity so far. She writes latterly that “even if I
  haven’t changed anyone else’s view of me, the process of writing this book has
  helped me arrive at a more balanced sense of myself”. That may be so, but it
  doesn’t feel like the whole story. • Libby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland
