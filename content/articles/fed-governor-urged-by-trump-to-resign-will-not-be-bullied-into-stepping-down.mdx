  Donald Trump has called on a Federal Reserve governor to immediately resign,
  renewing his extraordinary attack on the central bank’s independence as
  officials mull next steps on interest rates. A close Trump ally accused Lisa
  Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden, of “potentially committing mortgage fraud”
  and urged the US Department of Justice to investigate. The claims have not
  been confirmed, and this evening Cook said she had “no intention of being
  bullied” into stepping down. The US president has repeatedly broken with
  precedent in recent months to demand the Fed cut rates and urge its chair,
  Jerome Powell, to quit after disregarding such calls. On Wednesday, Trump
  leaped on the allegations about Cook. The governor “must resign, now!!!”, he
  wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. Cook, whose current term on
  the Fed’s board extends until 2038, previously served on the council of
  economic advisers under Barack Obama. When she took office in May 2022, she
  became the first Black woman to sit on the central bank’s board. On Wednesday
  morning, Bill Pulte, head of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has
  become – beyond the president himself – one of the Trump administration’s most
  vocal critics of Powell and the Fed, published allegations against Cook. In
  June 2021, Cook entered into a 15-year mortgage agreement on a property in Ann
  Arbor, Michigan, and declared her intention to use it as her principal
  residence, according to Pulte. In July 2021, Cook bought a property in
  Atlanta, Georgia, and also committed to use that property as her primary
  residence when taking out a 30-year mortgage, according to Pulte. Pulte
  referred Cook to the justice department for a criminal investigation, and
  promptly called on her to resign. “How can this woman be in charge of interest
  rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?” he wrote on
  X, formerly Twitter. In a statement, Cook responded: “I have no intention of
  being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised
  in a tweet.” She said she had learned Pulte had announced he was making a
  criminal referral “from the media”. She said: “I do intend to take any
  questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal
  Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any
  legitimate questions and provide the facts.” Cook is the latest figure to be
  targeted by Trump officials over claims of mortgage fraud. Pulte has made
  similar allegations about the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and
  the California senator Adam Schiff, both Democrats. The justice department is
  reportedly investigating. James has dismissed the claims as “baseless”. Schiff
  has vehemently denied the allegations, and accused the administration of
  weaponizing the US justice system. As Trump and his officials continue to
  pressure the Fed to cut rates, minutes from the central bank’s latest meeting
  underlined how most policymakers plan to scrutinize data over the coming weeks
  to gauge the economic impact of the administration’s policies. While Fed
  policymakers again opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in
  July, two of its governors opposed the decision – the first time multiple
  governors have voted against the majority since 1993. Fed officials “assessed
  that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in the prices of
  some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation
  remained to be seen”, the minutes said. “They also noted that it would take
  time to have more clarity on the magnitude and persistence of higher tariffs’
  effects on inflation.” After the meeting, official employment data showed that
  jobs growth stalled this summer – prompting Trump to fire the federal
  government official in charge of labor statistics – as inflation continued to
  rise. The two governors who called for rate cuts, Christopher Waller and
  Michelle Bowman, were each appointed by Trump during his first term. Both have
  been floated as potential replacements for Powell, whose term as chair will
  end next May. Powell is due to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the
  annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Wyoming on Friday, which will
  be closely scrutinized for signs of where the Fed plans to take rates over the
  coming months.
