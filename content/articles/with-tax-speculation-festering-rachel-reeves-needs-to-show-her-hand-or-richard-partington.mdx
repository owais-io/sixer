  The cruel summer of speculation is here. Barely a day passes without the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, waking to another newspaper headline about possible
  tax-raising options for her autumn budget. After the bonanza of June’s
  spending review, Reeves had been warned that uncertainty about the public
  finances would set tongues wagging. Britain’s economy has far from shot the
  lights out since, the global backdrop remains fairly bleak, borrowing costs
  are high, and inflationary pressures are building. This week marks the point
  at which November becomes the earliest date the chancellor can hold her
  budget, given the 10 weeks’ notice she must provide the Office for Budget
  Responsibility (OBR) to prepare its forecasts. Between now and then will feel
  like a near carbon copy of Labour’s first months in office, packed with
  rumours about a tax-laden autumn budget, only worse: this time the feelgood
  spending decisions have already been announced. Within the Treasury officials
  are running the rule over several options. However, forecasters are unclear
  about just how much needs to be done; causing a headache for Labour by sending
  the rumour mill into overdrive. On the most extreme estimates, Reeves is
  facing a shortfall of as much as £50bn to maintain the same headroom against
  her self-imposed fiscal rules as she had left herself in the spring. Others
  say the sum could be as little as £17bn. Any talk of such a “black hole” is
  still obviously bad news. After Reeves blasted Jeremy Hunt for leaving Labour
  a £22bn shortfall ahead of the last autumn budget, deflecting blame will be
  tougher a second time around. Still, the uncertainty ought to be illustrative.
  Forecasting the British economy at the moment is a fool’s errand. On the one
  hand, inflationary pressures are building and unemployment is rising. Growth
  remains weak and Donald Trump’s trade war looms in the background. On the
  other hand, wage settlements are still robust, and business activity, consumer
  sentiment and public borrowing levels appear stronger than anticipated. Mired
  in the fog, the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee required an
  unprecedented two rounds of voting this month to overcome a split decision on
  interest rates. A slim majority on the nine-strong panel felt that a weak
  economic outlook required a cut in borrowing costs, while others – including
  the MPC’s deputy governor, Clare Lombardelli, and the Bank’s chief economist,
  Huw Pill – felt that growth was resilient enough, and feared inflationary
  pressures. Woeful data quality from the Office for National Statistics – where
  several key economic indicators are bogged down with issues – is making
  matters worse, with the Newport-based agency openly described by experienced
  economists as “a shower” and “in chaos”. Ahead of the autumn budget, the OBR
  is working to update its assessment of the economy’s productive capacity. Most
  economists predict a hefty downgrade, which could add £20bn to Reeves’s budget
  shortfall. But two key datasets for the measurement of output per hour of
  work, GDP and the labour force survey, are prone to revision or are being
  fixed because of quality issues. Taking all of this together, analysts at the
  Japanese bank Mizuho last week warned global investors looking at Britain:
  “It’s hard to know if we’re looking at a truthful message. Forget summer
  holidays, it’s survival camp and the compass is broken.” But while extracting
  the signal from the noise – as economists describe the job of translating
  messy data – is a thankless task, somebody has to do it. And the danger is
  that missteps will be made as policymakers rush to turn around years of
  underperformance. Part of the reason Reeves has not set a budget date is the
  hope that things will improve as summer turns to autumn. But because she left
  slim headroom against her fiscal rules at the spring statement, even small
  negative developments have the capacity to blow things off course. While
  Labour has signalled that it will roll the pitch to manage budget
  expectations, so far it has left tax speculation to fester. That approach is
  one that cannot last. Economists have warned Reeves repeatedly against
  fine-tuning her fiscal plans against highly changeable forecasts. Like most
  forecasters, the OBR often gets things wrong, and always updates its view.
  Given the higher degree of uncertainty than normal, an even more cautious
  approach is warranted this time. As Prof Jagjit Chadha, the Cambridge
  University economist and former director of the National Institute of Economic
  and Social Research, told me: “Should you be driving a car with mechanical
  problems as fast as you’re trying to drive it? The answer is no.” As she
  prepares for a high-stakes budget, Reeves could look to the Bank, her former
  employer, for guidance. Threadneedle Street has taken its fair share of flak
  over recent years for its communication. But, unusually, its message is
  currently spot-on. Andrew Bailey, the governor, has spoken of the need for a
  “gradual and careful” approach to cutting interest rates given the uncertain
  outlook and conflicting messages from official data sources. For Reeves, the
  trouble is that Britain has been through years of chaos and uncertainty,
  having been jolted through external shocks and self-inflicted wounds under a
  merry-go-round of incompetent Tory administrations. After Labour’s promise of
  “change”, voters are impatient to see a turnaround. Waiting for a clearer
  economic picture to emerge is incompatible with the job of governing. To quell
  the summer of speculation the chancellor will need to start sending a few
  signals soon.
