  Donald Trump renewed a threat to impose sanctions on Russia if there was no
  progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine, as Moscow said there
  remained “no meeting planned” between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
  “I’m going to make a decision as to what we do and it’s going to be a very
  important decision, and that’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or
  massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it’s your fight,” Trump
  said, showing apparent frustration at Moscow a week after his meeting with
  Putin in Alaska. The president said he was unhappy about a Russian strike on
  an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured
  some of the facility’s employees. The Ukrainian president said on Friday that
  Russia was doing everything it could to prevent a meeting between him and
  Putin. Trump had said he had begun the arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskty
  meeting after a call with the Russian leader on Monday that followed their
  Alaska meeting, while Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for Putin to meet him,
  saying it is the only way to negotiate an end to the war. Russia’s foreign
  minister, Sergei Lavrov, told NBC there was no meeting planned, but Putin was
  “ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And
  this agenda is not ready at all.” The statement, echoing Moscow’s rhetoric
  about a leaders’ meeting being impossible unless certain conditions were met,
  was a setback for Trump, who had spent the week declaring a diplomatic
  breakthrough in his bid to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to peace. Even as
  Trump voiced frustration with the slow progress on a potential peace deal, he
  showed White House reporters a photograph of his meeting with Putin on the red
  carpet in Alaska, and said Putin wanted to attend the World Cup 2026 football
  tournament in the US. “I’m going to sign this for him. But I was sent one, and
  I thought you would like to see it, it’s a man named Vladimir Putin, who I
  believe will be coming, depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he
  may not, depending on what happens,” Trump said. Trump’s comments did not
  address the fact that Russia was banned from international competitions such
  as the World Cup after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and has not taken part in
  qualification for the 2026 tournament, which will be hosted by the US, Canada
  and Mexico. During a visit to a nuclear research centre on Friday, Putin said
  there was “light at the end of the tunnel” for a restoration of US-Russia
  relations. “We had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,” Putin
  said, adding “the next steps now depend on the leadership of the United
  States, but I am confident that the leadership qualities of the current
  president.” His comments signalled Russia’s optimism that it can mend
  relations with the US and strike business deals, despite the lack of clear
  progress towards ending the Ukraine conflict. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians
  have been killed in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Russia launched in
  2022. Analysts estimate that more than a million soldiers on both sides have
  been killed or wounded and fighting is continuing unabated, with both sides
  also attacking energy facilities. Russia has maintained its longstanding
  demand for Ukraine to give up land it still holds in two eastern regions while
  proposing to freeze the frontline in two more southerly regions Moscow claims
  fully as its own and possibly hand back small pieces of other Ukrainian
  territory it controls. Zelenskyy meanwhile has dropped his demand for a
  lengthy ceasefire as a prerequisite for a leaders’ meeting, although he has
  previously said Ukraine cannot negotiate under the barrel of a gun. On
  Thursday, Zelenskyy had accused Russia of “trying to wriggle out of holding a
  meeting”, adding that Moscow wanted to continue the offensive. The question of
  eventual security guarantees for Ukraine has been front and centre of the
  US-led diplomatic push to broker a peace deal to end the conflict. Trump – who
  hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders at the White House on Monday before
  making a call to Putin – said Russia had agreed to some western security
  guarantees for Kyiv. But Moscow later cast doubt on any such arrangement,
  Lavrov saying on Wednesday that discussing them without Russia was “a road to
  nowhere.” “When Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, I honestly do
  not yet know who is threatening them,” said Zelenskyy, who wants foreign
  troops in Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the future. With Reuters, Agence
  France-Presse and the Associated Press
