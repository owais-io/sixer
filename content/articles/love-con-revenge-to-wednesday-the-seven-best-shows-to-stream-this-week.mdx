  Pick of the week Love Con Revenge You might recognise Cecilie Fjellhøy from
  Netflix’s 2022 documentary The Tinder Swindler – she was one of the victims of
  fraudster Simon Leviev. This series represents another related dispatch from
  the wild west of modern communication. Fjellhøy is turning detective, joining
  forces with formidable private investigator Brianne Joseph (“I’m like a
  pitbull: when I grab hold of something, I don’t let it go”) to unmask romantic
  scammers on behalf of men and women who have been duped. It is startling how
  widespread this kind of crime has become. Expect a mixture of assiduous online
  preparation and high-octane moments when scammers are physically confronted.
  Netflix, from Friday 5 September *** The Runarounds Another entry into the
  patchy pantheon of bands who only really exist in the context of TV shows.
  This earnest YA drama tells the story of the Runarounds, a band who popped up
  in the third season of mystery series Outer Banks but now have an origin story
  of their own. They play a clean-cut brand of pop-rock but, like all
  semi-fictional bands, have a backstory full of strife. Frontman William is a
  true rock’n’roll believer – the band is his ride-or-die career option. Can he
  keep the dream alive in the face of self-doubt, disapproving parents and
  bandmates disappearing to university? Prime Video, from Monday 1 September ***
  Wednesday Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) has a new spirit guide. But while
  the return of Gwendoline Christie’s Principal Weems is a fine act of fan
  service, it won’t be much fun for Wednesday. As the concluding four episodes
  of this wickedly enjoyable second season arrive, she has a lot on her plate.
  Worse still, most of it is her own fault – for a start, can she recapture
  Tyler before he endangers her family? This show is an absolute treat,
  imaginatively realised and swarming with witty, macabre detail. Plus, prepare
  for a new cast member who is guaranteed to send the Monsters absolutely Gaga.
  Netflix, from Wednesday 3 September *** A Remarkable Place to Die Skippers
  Canyon in Queenstown, New Zealand might prosaically be described as an
  accident blackspot. But this dangerous stretch of road is at the heart of a
  sturdy if unremarkable cop drama. Anais Mallory (Chelsie Preston Crayford) is
  the gifted but mildly troubled detective at the heart of the action. She has
  returned to her small town, ostensibly to help her mother through a
  bereavement, but secretly to solve a mystery with a grievous personal loss at
  its core. Why do cars continue to plunge from the nearby cliff? Are these
  crashes really accidents? U, from Wednesday 3 September *** Omerta This
  self-consciously weighty thriller (adapted from a novel by Ilkka Remes)
  capitalises on the often tricky geopolitical position of Finland – which is
  often regarded as a buffer state between Europe and Russia. On the country’s
  Independence Day, celebrations turn to terror as the Finnish president is
  taken hostage by apparent terrorists. But, as is usually the way, the stakes
  are even higher than they first appear as a plot unfolds that threatens the
  whole continent. Can hostage negotiator Max Tanner (Jasper Pääkkönen) save the
  day? Channel 4, Friday 5 September *** Road Trip: Shorts These snappy and
  cheerfully inventive animations bring together characters from across the
  channel’s extensive cartoon portfolio. Running at about a minute each, they
  feature the likes of Kiff the mischievous squirrel and anxious teen Hailey
  Banks as they embark upon a variety of road trips. The format is basic but the
  subject matter is child’s-eye universal. From the excitement of ordering fast
  food to the nightmare of having to visit a historical museum instead of a
  waterpark, they’re full of recognisable childhood holiday experiences.
  Disney+, from Friday 5 September *** Queen Mantis There is an awkward
  mother-son relationship in this Korean drama: Jeong I-sin was given the
  nickname Mantis after committing five brutal murders. Subsequently, she’s
  spent two decades in prison while her son, Cha Soo-yeol, has grown up to be
  very different. He is now a police officer who has disowned his mother and,
  somewhat inevitably, specialises in capturing serial killers. However, when a
  murder bears all the hallmarks of a Mantis copycat killing, he is forced to
  pay her a long-overdue visit. Absurdly contrived but good, gruesome fun.
