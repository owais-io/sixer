webTitle: Sault review – GCSE-level drama performance borders on the pretentious

  It’s no surprise that Sault’s All Points East performance is their first UK
  festival slot ever. An elaborate storyline, conveyed through GCSE-level acting
  and colossal set design, lands on the deaf ears of an audience who came to
  listen, not watch. External factors cause a rocky start. Their set time is
  changed at the last minute to 5pm, clashing with every other stage. As crowds
  reluctantly drag themselves to the East Stage, they wait until 6pm for
  anything to happen: a full hour of inactivity. Worse, Cleo Sol, Chronixx and
  Sault are billed as Providence, meant to perform until 11pm, holding audiences
  hostage without set times, clarity, or other stages to go to. A towering
  pyramid looms in the crowd, visually impressive but obscuring the main stage
  for many. Then an equivocal drama performance begins. As a collective, Sault
  revel in mystery: aside from Cleo Sol and Inflo, its members are anonymous.
  But the actors’ dialogue is inaudible, and the audience grows restless.
  Finally, a traditional African choir opens before the collective launches into
  Glory and Free. The aesthetic – simultaneously Star Wars Tatooine futuristic
  and biblically ancient – looks polished, and fits with Sault’s knack for
  blending classical and contemporary genres in their music. Standout moments
  include Warrior, with Chronixx joining on stage, Son Shine and Wildfires,
  perfect for London summer evenings. Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def) also
  delivers a seamless guest verse on Stop Dem. For the rest of the show, the
  dancers appear to be the focus, but the visual impact is impaired by the
  massive pyramid. Hits like Masterpiece are diminished. Pray for Me and SOTH
  feel overly artistic, bordering on pretentious. Theatrics might work in an
  intimate venue, but for the festival crowd, the inaccessible themes feel
  alienating. After another awkward drama piece, Chronixx brings the evening
  back with a captivating reggae set. But things unravel when Bey returns for a
  surprise 30-minute set, spinning like a whirling dervish while questioning
  societal progress in his freestyles. Neighbours gently explain, “This guy sang
  Ms Fat Booty.” When Cleo Sol finally appears at 10pm, she thanks the crowd
  “for your patience”. Real name Cleopatra Nikolic, she looks pharaonic atop the
  pyramid with an ethereal voice, but by then, the crowd has thinned
  significantly. Spellbinding singing can’t save Sault. The interstitial skits
  occupy nearly as much time as the performance, and the audience members strain
  to wrap their heads around something they shouldn’t have to understand.
