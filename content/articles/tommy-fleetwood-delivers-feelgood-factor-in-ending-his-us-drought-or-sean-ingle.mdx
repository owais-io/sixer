  Some of us have always known that deep inside Tommy Fleetwood lurked a
  cold‑blooded winner. Back in the late 90s I was working at the golf magazine
  Fore! when the deputy editor, Simon Caney, returned to the office after being
  thrashed 6&amp;5 by a tiny eight-year-old who had shown him no mercy. His
  name? Tommy Fleetwood. Now the rest of the world knows that killer instinct
  exists, too. But Fleetwood’s FedEx Cup victory, his first in 164 events on the
  PGA Tour, also reinforced something else. Everyone loves Tommy. Right. Left.
  Maga. Liberal. Whatever. It doesn’t matter. At East Lake they were chanting
  his name as he lifted the trophy – while on X, Tiger Woods, Adam Sandler and
  Caitlin Clark all posted their support. Even on social media, so often a
  cesspit of anger and bile, the equivalent of a Christmas Day armistice broke
  out. Back in 2023 a survey in Sportico found that PGA supporters were among
  the most rightward fanbases in sport, with 56% self-identified as “more
  conservative” compared with 44% who were “more liberal”. Yet in our
  hyper-polarised world, where sides are taken and battle lines drawn, Fleetwood
  is one of the few male sports stars for whom we universally root. How many
  others come to mind? Leo Messi, Carlos Alcaraz and Luke Littler, for sure.
  Scottie Scheffler and Justin Rose, too. Until last week I would have said
  Eberechi Eze as well. But after that my list soon dries up. Of course seeing
  the nearly man of golf finally break America was behind the vast outpouring of
  joy on Sunday. How could it not be? But Fleetwood’s reaction to his victory
  showed you why so many were willing him home in the first place. After he hit
  the winning putt he leaned back and screamed towards the heavens in an act of
  joy and catharsis, before the camera panned to Justin Rose and Shane Lowry,
  who were both celebrating. But before greeting his Ryder Cup teammates,
  Fleetwood went over to hug his stepson Oscar, who was sobbing away, and ask
  him: “Are you OK?” You can’t fake genuine. And that one small act told you
  everything you need to know about Fleetwood. Even in the moment of his
  greatest triumph, he was being human and thinking of others. Then again
  Fleetwood, the son of a roadworker from Southport who started playing at his
  local municipal course, has long shown us the type of person he is. When
  President Trump criticised the NHS in 2018, for instance, Fleetwood retweeted
  a post telling him to mind his own business. And then he made his feelings
  ever clearer in an interview in the Times shortly afterwards. “I thought what
  he said was absolute rubbish,” he said. “There are certain things you are
  proud of as a British citizen and the NHS is by far and away the No 1 thing.
  I’m a big believer.” Of course things got a bit hairy on Sunday. There was a
  wobble on holes 8, 9 and 10, and with Scheffler and Keegan Bradley mounting a
  charge you feared that history might repeat itself. If Fleetwood was nervous
  he certainly had plenty of time to think about it, too, given his playing
  partner, Patrick Cantlay, was dawdling even more than usual. Imagine what was
  going through Fleetwood’s mind. In the past seven years he had finished in the
  top five 29 times on the PGA without winning. No wonder that when he led by
  two shots with three holes to play, as he had at the Travelers and the St Jude
  Championship, he had the walk of a condemned man. Yet this time the nerve
  held. “When you have lost it so many times, a three‑shot down the last doesn’t
  feel that many,” he joked afterwards. It was classic Fleetwood, modest and
  self-effacing. Beforehand he had talked about taking the positives from every
  setback. That is what every sports star says, of course. But Fleetwood
  actually proved as good as his word. How he didn’t plunge into a doom‑spiral
  or weeks of self-pity should be a subject for a sports psychology textbook.
  And his victory also served as a pick‑me-up to the rest of us. Perhaps if you
  take enough shots at something, even when you are getting kicked in the teeth,
  the hard work will pay off. Either way, it always felt harsh for some to brand
  Fleetwood a choker, or – as in Paul Azinger’s case five years ago – demand
  that he win in the US to prove himself. The 34-year-old is, after all, a
  multiple winner on the DP World Tour and an Olympic silver medallist. He also
  gained four points out of five on his Ryder Cup debut in 2018 and earned the
  Cup-winning point in Rome in 2023. You don’t do that if your knees are always
  knocking under pressure. True, this wasn’t the biggest or most dramatic
  golfing victory of the year. Rory McIlroy at the Masters sewed up that award
  long ago. But it was, to these eyes, the most heartwarming: the equivalent of
  a John Lewis Christmas advert that makes you feel better every time you think
  about it. Of course it will be very different when it comes to the Ryder Cup
  in four weeks’ time. President Trump will be there. The crowd will be pumped
  up and baying for blood. And there certainly won’t be any “Tommy! Tommy!”
  chants. But for now we can all rejoice in having watched Fleetwood break the
  curse. And doesn’t the world feel a better place for it?
