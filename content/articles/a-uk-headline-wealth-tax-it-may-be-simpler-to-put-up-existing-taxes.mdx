  Pressure to go further on wealth taxes – by creating new modes of clawing at
  hoards of hard-to-reach cash – is mounting. For starters, the fiscal picture
  is looking fairly bleak, with economists estimating that Rachel Reeves must
  raise £20bn – or even as much as £50bn – to meet her goal of balancing
  day-to-day spending against the revenue raised from taxation. On the
  government backbenches, meanwhile, MPs want the chancellor to squeeze the
  richest in society harder. They even put forward an early day motion last
  month calling for a 2% annual tax on individual assets over £10m. Yet
  introducing these kinds of taxes is often not straightforward, with the
  behaviour of the wealthy being hard to monitor and harder still to predict.
  The first significant problem is working out where the assets are and who
  holds them. That has always been difficult and has become even more
  challenging after one of the most important economic surveys, the household
  wealth data series, was suspended by the Office for National Statistics
  because of its low quality. The upshot is that HMRC simply does not know how
  many millionaires or billionaires there are in the UK. Without reliable
  figures, it is extremely hard to write policies, cost them and administer
  them. There is also a battle to be had with an “old guard with set views” in
  Whitehall. Whitehall sources paint a picture of a Treasury led by figures
  influenced by economists whose thinking was prominent at Oxford University in
  the 1980s and 90s – such as James Mirrlees, Christophe Chamley and Tony
  Atkinson – leading to something of an orthodox view. In a nutshell, that
  position is that if you tax capital too much, it will stop investment and
  hamper growth. Or, in Chamley’s words: “Tax rate on capital income tends to
  zero in the long run.”. Since this era, the debate within economics has become
  more nuanced. A growing body of research suggests that some taxation on
  capital, even at relatively high rates, could lead to greater investment. As
  it becomes less attractive to hoard wealth because of taxation, risk appetites
  would then increase in pursuit of higher returns. You might be less tempted to
  keep your money in a vanilla savings account that can be taxed hard and easily
  if you can get a much better rate of return – even with a bit more risk –
  elsewhere. Treasury insiders argue that Reeves has followed the more modern
  logic, having already taken steps to widen the scope of inheritance and
  capital gains tax (IHT and CGT). They posit that her reluctance to pursue a
  headline wealth tax does not mean she has pulled her punches when it comes to
  taxing wealth. Hostile backbenchers, on the other hand, suggest she follows
  the old orthodoxy too closely. They often cite her decision to go for
  relatively small changes in the amounts of tax paid via CGT, rather than bring
  it more closely in line with income tax at the last budget, which also upset
  more senior political colleagues. What the debate about how to handle changes
  to IHT (which have been fiercely opposed by farmers) or CGT illustrates is
  that if the government really wants to tax wealth more effectively then it has
  all kinds of ways to do so before opting for a politically – and potentially
  economically – sensitive route with a headline wealth tax. Yet even changing
  existing mechanisms might not be easy, when the UK already has one of the
  highest rates of tax on property and wealth among developed economies,
  according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
  Political pressure may make it harder to maintain a more gradualist approach,
  however. Figures on the left of the Labour parliamentary party are attracted
  to totemic wealth taxes of the kind introduced in Spain – its so-called
  solidarity tax – and Switzerland. They see it as part of showing a commitment
  to rebalancing the economy. Reeves is critical of international examples,
  saying that Switzerland does not have IHT, and that Spain’s wealth tax is so
  riddled with exemptions that it raises too little money. Some developed
  economies that had comparable wealth taxes have dropped them, too. “We have
  inheritance tax. We have capital gains. We’ve just got rid of the non-dom tax
  status that doesn’t exist anymore in our tax system. So we do have taxes that
  tax the wealthy,” Reeves said in a recent interview with LBC. Other measures
  that go further are not yet proven to work, she claims, saying that those who
  “come up with simple solutions” must do more to “explain exactly how it would
  work, whether it’s an ongoing tax, what it would do to tax avoidance, what it
  would do about people moving or changing the way that their wealth is stored”.
  Economists argue that the government should focus its energies on raising
  existing taxes, such as equalising CGT with income tax, for example, or
  changing gifting rules around IHT first, rather than introduce a novel wealth
  tax. The Treasury is already examining gifting rules among other possible IHT
  changes. Yet while Reeves might agree with some of these arguments, it’s less
  clear whether her cabinet colleagues will tolerate a slow and steady approach,
  particularly if the fiscal picture sours.
