  You remember your first. Mine was in 1978 – a turquoise flash zipping low over
  a murky Oxfordshire river. A moment in the eyes, a lifetime in the memory.
  I’ve seen plenty more kingfishers since then, but you never spurn an
  opportunity, and the Water of Leith – a tranquil haven minutes from
  Edinburgh’s centre – fits the bill. Just over 20 miles from source in the
  Pentlands to outflow into the Firth of Forth, it has earned its reputation as
  Edinburgh’s hidden jewel. You could spend a month here and never suspect its
  existence, yet for the initiated it offers respite from the relentlessness of
  fringe season. Upstream, there are otters tumbling in the stiller waters
  outside the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art; downstream, a tern colony
  watching over Leith Docks. Here at Stockbridge, a heron stands patiently on
  the bank, straggle-bearded with a dagger bill. The city’s bustle is just up
  the hill, a thousand miles away. Once part of Edinburgh’s industrial
  heartland, with more than 70 mills lining its banks, the river’s shallow
  waters now run clear, home to thriving fish and invertebrate populations – and
  that means birds. A dipper sits on a midstream rock, brown plumage matching
  the peat-stained water, white chest catching the eye. Portly yet nimble, it
  hops down, plunges below the surface, and walks along the bed. Most songbirds
  don’t do this. But most songbirds don’t have solid bones, nasal flaps to stop
  water going up their nose, or a milky-white third eyelid – a “nictitating
  membrane” – to protect the eyes. A special bird, the dipper. This one rummages
  with nervous bobbing movements – then it’s off, like a dumpling late for a
  dentist’s appointment. And where there are dippers, grey wagtails often
  follow. Grey above and yellow below, their tails pump constantly as if plugged
  into the mains. Two of them cavort in the shade by the water’s edge –
  irrepressible, irresistible. Up the rise towards Dean Village. All I need to
  complete the walk is oh look. A turquoise flash – a time-traveller from 1978 –
  zips low over the water. It lands, sits, still. But not for long. A darting
  foray and up it comes with a wriggling silver sliver. Sit, dive, fish – a
  stunning trifecta of kingfisheriness. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of
