  Yasir al-Rumayyan will not have to step very far from the front door of his
  magnificent Riyadh villa to encounter a chameleon. The kaleidoscopically
  coated members of the lizard family can be found almost everywhere across the
  Arabian peninsula and the wider Middle East but Newcastle’s chair probably did
  not expect to meet one at St James’ Park on Monday night. Given Eddie Howe’s
  preference for wearing the same black club tracksuit at almost every
  opportunity he initially seems an unlikely northern European offshoot of the
  species. Yet in responding to a series of setbacks by, sometimes quite
  radically, adjusting his tactical colours, Newcastle’s manager has proved
  himself the cleverest of chameleons. In the absence of their striking striker,
  Alexander Isak, Newcastle have taken one point from two games, at Aston Villa
  and at home to Liverpool, but those stumbles were much more about bad luck
  than Howe’s judgment. It is not the manager’s fault that Isak’s enduring
  desperation to force a move to Anfield is understood to have left him
  resistant to an olive branch extended by Newcastle’s minority owner Jamie
  Reuben and representatives of the majority owners, Saudi Arabia’s Public
  Investment Fund, when they met the Sweden forward in Northumberland on Monday
  afternoon. Much as the T-shirts and hats on sale outside St James’ Park
  bearing the message “Isak is a rat” emphasised that the love affair between
  the Swede and Newcastle fans seems all but over, so too is Howe’s time as a
  football romantic. A coach who, during his Bournemouth days, was regarded as
  far too wedded to an idealistic Kevin Keegan-esque dream of attacking purism
  to develop the pragmatism and defensive nous needed to reach the top is now
  fully adept at altering his strategic colours to suit differing tactical
  challenges. Chameleons tend to turn darker when facing potential stress and
  this was how Howe’s team approached Mohamed Salah’s visit with Liverpool. The
  pair have history: the Egypt forward has scored or created 22 goals against
  Howe’s Bournemouth and now Newcastle, making him the player with the most goal
  contributions against a single manager in Premier League history. Granted it
  was Salah’s cross that led to the 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha’s winner as, in the
  11th minute of stoppage time, Arne Slot’s team secured a dramatic 3-2 victory,
  but the right-sided forward was otherwise well subdued by Howe’s blueprint.
  “I’m not sure if I saw a football match today,” reflected Slot, tellingly. “It
  was set piece after set piece, long throw after long throw. It was impossible
  for us to control this game.” Had Anthony Gordon not been sent off for an
  unnecessary lunge into Virgil van Dijk late in the first half and the key
  midfielders Sandro Tonali and Joelinton not subsequently sustained
  worrying-looking respective shoulder and groin injuries, Newcastle might well
  have reprised March’s Carabao Cup triumph against Liverpool. Significantly,
  Howe’s decision to deploy a barrage of long balls as his team turned unusually
  direct forced Liverpool into hurried clearances and left Salah and Cody Gakpo
  chasing a stream of aerial balls they were never going to control. In refusing
  to risk passing out from the back, while ensuring Alisson was pressed into
  persistently kicking long, a tall, physical Newcastle ensured the ball was in
  play for only 40.8% of the contest. That was the lowest percentage registered
  in a Premier League game since 2010 when Stoke and Blackburn recorded similar
  statistics as they traded broadly similar blows. Howe may once have revelled
  in watching reruns of Keegan’s Newcastle entertainers and adored Arsenal’s
  passing and movement during Arsène Wenger’s Cesc Fàbregas era but he will not
  allow Newcastle to develop similar vulnerabilities. It explains why, despite
  an ongoing failure to sign at least one new striker, – although an improved
  bid for Jørgen Strand Larsen is expected to be considered seriously by the
  Wolves board this week – Newcastle’s appointment of Martin Mark as their new
  set-piece coach constituted an important piece of close-season recruitment.
  Mark, who joined from Midtjylland in his native Denmark, has evidently been
  schooling Tino Livramento in the art of long throws and the England
  full-back’s missiles persistently unsettled Slot’s defence as Howe’s 10 men
  briefly drew level after falling 2-0 behind. More of the same will be required
  at Leeds on Saturday when Gordon begins a three-game suspension and Tonali,
  Joelinton and the concussed Fabian Schär are expected to be sidelined. “This
  isn’t going to be a simple season for us,” cautioned Howe as he awaits
  Thursday’s Champions League draw while hoping for a speedy resolution of the
  debilitating Isak saga. Rumayyan and his fellow visitors from Saudi Arabia
  made a great show of racing down to the pitch to console their manager at the
  final whistle on Monday but they should arguably have arrived on Tyneside to
  resolve Isak’s future far earlier. Howe is faced with the unpalatable prospect
  of the Saudis either refusing to sell the striker and leaving him stuck with
  an unwilling player or Newcastle receiving a record transfer fee from
  Liverpool too late to invest on the high-calibre replacement he desperately
  requires. Small wonder that, on Monday, the 47-year-old reiterated he wanted
  only players “committed to Newcastle” and required swift “clarity” on Isak in
  order to “change the narrative”. After a summer spent somehow retaining his
  dignity and courtesy amid an unrelenting blizzard of striking forward-related
  inquiries at a club still seeking a chief executive and sporting director,
  Howe deserves much more than performative public hugs from Rumayyan.
