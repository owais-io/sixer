  People seeking cheap Botox-like injections have been warned by experts against
  doing it themselves due to the risk of “eyelid droops”, infection and even
  botulism. There are growing concerns over the availability of medication
  called Innotox that is being sold illegally online in the UK. Unlike Botox,
  which comes as a powder that must be reconstituted for use in an injection,
  Innotox is a ready-to-use liquid – making it easier to self-administer. Wes
  Streeting, the health secretary, announced plans this week to introduce
  legislation cracking down on England’s cosmetic “wild west”, where there is
  scant regulation of who can deliver treatments such as dermatological filler
  and Botox. Experts say Innotox is not licensed for use in the UK, unlike some
  other liquid Botox-like injections, meaning its quality and safety has not
  been assessed. Aenone Harper-Machin, a consultant plastic surgeon and
  spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and
  Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS), said the online availability of Innotox was
  frightening and appalling, and she cautioned against DIY jabs. “People could
  be giving themselves eyelid droops and all sorts of weird asymmetries by
  injecting it in the wrong place, too deeply, too superficially. You can inject
  it into your blood vessel and give yourself botulism,” she said. Products such
  as Botox and Innotox contain type A botulinum toxin, which blocks nerve
  signals and prevents muscles from contracting. While botulinum toxin is a
  prescription-only medicine in the UK, Innotox can be readily bought online
  without one, amid longstanding concerns about untrained and unregulated
  providers, as well as unlicensed or counterfeit products. Health officials
  have said 41 recent cases of botulism poisoning in England have been linked to
  unlicensed jabs. Harper-Machin has had Botox-like injections but said she
  would not self-administer them. “I wouldn’t have it done by anybody other than
  a consultant plastic surgeon who has intimate knowledge of facial anatomy,”
  she said. Botox jabs have become a routine procedure for many people. The
  government estimates that about 900,000 such injections are carried out in the
  UK each year. Despite now being available in high street clinics, their high
  cost and the regular need for top-up treatment has fuelled a desire for
  cheaper alternatives. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
  (MHRA) says it is unlawful to sell unauthorised medicines, although in certain
  circumstances unauthorised medicines may be supplied under the supervision of
  a healthcare professional. Nora Nugent, the president of the British
  Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), said: “While rare, BAAPS
  has become aware of isolated but concerning cases of individuals experiencing
  serious complications following self-injection of botulinum toxin and dermal
  filler products. “These include infections, tissue damage and, in extreme
  cases, the need for multiple surgical interventions. We are aware of cases
  that have resulted in significant tissue damage and tissue loss needing
  multiple surgical interventions and resulting in permanent scarring.” Sophie
  Cooper, the managing director of the Harley Street Skin Clinic, said: “Content
  creators on TikTok have been sharing their results from self-injecting
  Innotox, which has been encouraging viewers to jump on the bandwagon. “Innotox
  has been reported to have a simpler injection process, be faster working,
  longer lasting and be lower in price. In reality, self-injecting Innotox as a
  Botox alternative comes with many dangers.” Tom Albright, the chief executive
  of Luvantas, a subsidiary of Medytox, which produces Innotox, said the company
  became aware in June of the unauthorised importation of Innotox to the US, UK
  and other countries and alerted Medytox management to the situation. “Medytox
  has opened an investigation into this matter and have engaged experts to
  assist in shutting down the sources of importation,” he said. “Patient safety
  is our highest priority. We strongly caution healthcare providers and
  consumers against purchasing unapproved or misrepresented botulinum toxins
  through unauthorised channels. Products distributed outside authorised supply
  chains may not meet safety, efficacy or storage standards.” He added:
  “Botulinum toxins should be administered only by qualified healthcare
  professionals in a medically appropriate setting. Administration requires a
  deep understanding of facial anatomy and aesthetic principles, which cannot be
  replicated in consumer-administered or unregulated environments.”
