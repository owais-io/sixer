  Florian Wirtz! Hugo Ekitiké! Milos Kerkez! Jérémie Frimpong! And soon,
  possibly, Alexander Isak! It’s vital, Bob Paisley always said, to build from a
  position of strength, and Liverpool this summer have certainly done that. If
  Isak does join, Liverpool’s transfer spending this summer will be approaching
  £400m, which would be the second-highest figure paid by any club in a single
  transfer window (behind only Chelsea in summer 2023) – the lack of signings
  last summer coupled with some canny sales has given them significant
  profitability and sustainability rules headroom. If there is a giddiness on
  Merseyside at the prospect, it’s understandable. Liverpool suddenly have a
  range of attacking options the like of which no Premier League club has had
  since perhaps the early days of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea. If pre-season
  games are anything to go by, it would seem there will be a shift from the
  4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid of last season to something more overtly 4-2-3-1, with
  Mohamed Salah, Wirtz and Cody Gakpo operating behind a centre-forward – at the
  moment Ekitiké but maybe later Isak. There is a clear sense of Arne Slot
  taking full command, as Jürgen Klopp’s rejig of the forward line is swept
  away. Which itself must be thrilling to Liverpool fans: if he could win the
  league, have them play as they did last season, with somebody else’s players,
  what could he do with his own? And it is exciting, there is a sense of a new
  era for the Premier League, of the battle ceasing to be Manchester City
  against Liverpool or Arsenal and becoming Liverpool against perhaps three
  challengers, if Chelsea’s performance in the Club World Cup final was
  indicative of the heights they could reach. But football is an endlessly
  complicated game; nothing is ever as straightforward as it appears it might
  be. With any change, there is doubt. In this era when so many coaches have a
  philosophy, a platonic ideal of the game towards which they are striving, it
  is one of football’s ironies that often the most successful sides are those
  that embody a tension. Slot won with Klopp’s players. Arsène Wenger
  constructed some of his best football at Arsenal on the foundations left by
  George Graham. Pep Guardiola finally won the Champions League after the
  arrival of Erling Haaland, whose reluctance to involve himself in midfield
  represented a significant point of difference to previous Guardiola
  centre-forwards. A pure manifestation of a theory without friction seems often
  less effective, perhaps more predictable, than a system built through
  compromise. That’s a vague, abstract concern, of greater relevance to future
  historians than the here and now; it would, after all, be absurd to criticise
  a manager for fashioning a team to their model of football. But there are more
  immediate worries. Firstly, by making possibly five major signings, have
  Liverpool changed too much at once? Every transfer is a risk, but changing
  almost half a team at once magnifies that risk. This probably isn’t what
  Liverpool planned. Uncomfortable as it may be to discuss Diogo Jota’s death in
  terms of its ramifications for squad-building, that is something the club have
  had to face. Liverpool seem to have acted very sensitively in helping players
  deal with their grief, but they also suddenly needed to buy a centre-forward.
  It may be that the new signings gel instantly but it’s entirely reasonable to
  expect that process of integration to take a few weeks. The more players come
  in, the longer that is likely to take and that could cost Liverpool a few
  points that, in a tight title race, could prove crucial. Liverpool perhaps
  benefited from the reverse last season, getting off to a fast start, winning
  11 of their first 13 league games under Slot in part because their lack of
  summer signings meant nobody (apart from Federico Chiesa) was having to adjust
  to new surroundings and teammates. Then there’s the question of balance.
  Jarell Quansah has been sold and while Joe Gomez remains at the club, his
  injury problems mean he cannot be relied upon. Ibrahima Konaté doesn’t have
  the best injury record and Virgil van Dijk is 34. That suggests a squad
  possibly short of a central defender, something highlighted by the fact Wataru
  Endo, Andy Robertson and Ryan Gravenberch have played in central defence at
  times in pre-season. Perhaps the plan is at times to use a midfielder in the
  back four, using possession as a defensive tool in the way Barcelona did with
  Javier Mascherano, but that would seem a ploy only really applicable to games
  against cautious opponents. That front four plus the two new full-backs feels
  very attacking. Perhaps that’s saying not much more than that Wirtz is a more
  attacking figure than Dominik Szoboszlai, but that will place additional
  defensive responsibility on the midfield pairing of Gravenberch and Alexis Mac
  Allister. Where Szoboszlai fits in is another question; as well as offering
  cover for Wirtz, he could perhaps play as one of the deeper midfielders
  against opponents who sit back and allow Liverpool possession. But that’s not
  the only tweak. Salah’s role could change quite significantly. He has always
  been at his best with a centre-forward who vacates the space for him to sweep
  into from his position on the right. Ekitiké and Isak are both mobile players,
  but they are both centre-forwards. They are not facilitators with the instinct
  to drop deep or pull wide in the way Roberto Firmino or Jota, or even Luis
  Díaz, did. Nor, in truth, with Wirtz seemingly likely to operate as a No 10,
  is there even obvious space for Ekitiké or Isak to drop into. That means an
  adjustment for Salah. It’s not an enormous issue. He’s played perfectly well
  with Darwin Núñez. There’ll be another tweak with Frimpong overlapping from
  full-back, going on his outside more frequently than Trent Alexander-Arnold
  did in later seasons. That should in theory help create room for Salah to dart
  inside, distracting the full-back, but it’s another element of uncertainty.
  And that’s the concern for Liverpool. The thrill of the signings is rooted in
  the pristine possibility, untarnished by experience, of what they could
  achieve together, but an inevitable accompaniment to that projection is the
  possibility of failure. The uncertainty of five new signings allows Liverpool
  to dream, but it also exposes them to doubt.
