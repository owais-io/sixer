  The crowd is sweltering under a red and gold awning, but Granny Wang has them
  rapt. Packed into the space in front of the 62-year-old’s small stage, and
  spilling out on to the wooden bleachers above, hundreds of people have
  gathered to hear Granny Wang – real name Zhao Mei – play matchmaker to young
  men and women at a daily show in a theme park in Kaifeng, an ancient city in
  central China’s Henan province. One man who volunteers to be set up comes on
  stage and tells Zhao that a previous relationship broke down due to a lack of
  time. “Well, now that you’ve met your ideal partner here, you’ll have the
  time,” she assures him, and the crowd cheers. Zhao has played the character of
  Granny Wang for eight years and introduced the matchmaking element of her show
  in 2023 – which brought her viral fame. Last year she went from having a few
  hundred thousand followers on Douyin, a Chinese social media app similar to
  TikTok, to more than 7 million, and has been called “China’s Cilla Black”, a
  reference to the late host of the British TV show Blind Date. But with some
  audience members arriving several hours early and enduring the mid-August heat
  to grab a front-row spot for the raucous and somewhat camp performance, Zhao
  could just as well be Henan’s Madonna. Most of the people in the audience are
  families looking for a way to entertain their children during the school
  holidays. But it seems that about one in five of them are looking for love. “I
  just do not want to stay single,” said Wang Mengjia, 18, after an unsuccessful
  spin on Zhao’s stage. Zhao has revived the character of the village
  matchmaker, a role that is going out of fashion now that many people meet
  online, through friends – or, increasingly, not at all. While there is a
  growing “love industry” of matchmaking services from local governments and
  commercial enterprises alike, would-be cupids face an uphill battle in China’s
  cities where the marriage market is increasingly being shunned altogether.
  Despite Zhao’s packed shows, China’s marriage rates have plummeted to record
  lows, a trend that is increasingly treated as a national crisis. Last year,
  the number of registered marriages dropped by a record 20%, falling to just
  over 6m, down from 7.7m in 2023. Compared with a decade earlier, the number of
  couples tying the knot each year has halved. The trend is particularly
  apparent among urban, educated women. More than 40% of urban 25- to
  29-year-olds have never married, up from 9% in 2000, according to analysis
  from Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California,
  Irvine. Some of this is because of China’s ageing population. Decades of the
  one-child policy, which was scrapped in 2016, forced the population into
  decline, meaning that the pool of people of marrying age has been shrinking.
  But, analysts say, demographics alone don’t explain the trend. “The deeper
  change is in attitudes,” said Lijia Zhang, a writer who is working on a book
  about marriage in China. “In the past, when the country was poor, marriage was
  an economic necessity … Now it’s about personal happiness, more than anything
  else, not filial duty or social obligation. Many urban, educated women no
  longer see marriage or motherhood as essential to a fulfilling life.” Hao
  Jingyi, 19, agrees. “If I don’t meet someone suitable, I would enjoy more
  freedom and comfort living alone … women are increasingly disappointed with
  men these days,” she said, as she waited for Zhao’s show to start. The Chinese
  government hopes to change her mind. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has called on
  women to “actively cultivate a new culture of marriage and childbearing” and
  has promoted a more traditional, patriarchal type of politics. China’s
  leadership is ideologically opposed to singledom and officials have a
  practical concern: falling birthrates. Even people who do couple up are
  increasingly rejecting parenthood, as young people – women in particular –
  worry that childrearing is too expensive and competitive. Last year China’s
  birthrate was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people, a slight increase on 2023’s
  record low of 6.39 but still dramatically lower than the figure from a decade
  ago. The Chinese authorities have introduced a slew of policies at national
  and local levels to encourage marriage and childbirth. This year the
  government rolled out an annual childcare subsidy of 3,600 yuan (£370) until
  the age of three and several provinces offer bonuses or extra holiday days for
  newlyweds. But many women feel it is not enough. Practicalities aside, there
  are other factors driving these trends. In July, the Chinese internet was
  briefly abuzz with the news of chat groups on the encrypted messaging app
  Telegram which, according to Chinese media reports, contained tens of
  thousands of Chinese men who shared pornographic pictures and videos of women,
  often taken without their consent, in the “MaskPark tree hole forum”. Women
  were outraged, with many feeling that the authorities did not do enough to
  protect them from sexual harassment. Violet Du Feng, a Chinese film-maker
  whose latest documentary, The Dating Game, follows men enrolled in a dating
  camp, said there was an increasing ideological gap between the sexes. She said
  the imbalance created by the one-child policy – there are now more than 30
  million more men than women in China – had led to “dissatisfaction about
  gender equality”. But while feminist activism used to be quietly tolerated, in
  the past decade the Chinese Communist party has cracked down on civil society,
  and the space to protest against issues such as sexual harassment has
  virtually disappeared. “Typically, in a more democratic society, you can point
  your finger at power,” Feng said, “but in China, you cannot.” So, “people are
  just pointing their fingers at each other. That creates even more extreme
  hostility between men and women.” Feng noted that when she was born in 1979,
  her mother had access to full-time, free childcare before she was two months
  old. When Feng had her own daughter in 2014, “there was nothing”. It’s not
  just women who are tired of the pressure to marry. Zhang Hongguang, 21, from
  Shandong province, attended Zhao’s event with his sister, who had persuaded
  him to join her in renting fancy-dress costumes for the outing. But the next
  day he had to return to his home town to grudgingly attend a blind date
  arranged by their parents, who had paid a matchmaker to set him up with
  someone. “I don’t like it, but it was the only way my parents had,” he said,
  adding that he preferred to just stay at home with his cat. His sister, Zhang
  Hongqian, a 24-year-old pilates teacher, had also been forced on several
  unsuccessful blind dates by their parents. “I’m not in a rush to find a
  partner,” she said. “If I can avoid getting married, I’ll choose not to get
  married.” Additional research by Lillian Yang
