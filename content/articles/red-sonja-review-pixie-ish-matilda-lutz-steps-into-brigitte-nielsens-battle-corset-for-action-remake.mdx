  Red Sonja review – pixie-ish Matilda Lutz steps into Brigitte Nielsen’s battle
  corset for action remake
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  Ever since Brigitte Nielsen unlaced her battle corset after shooting ended on
  pulpy fantasy actioner Red Sonja back in the 1980s, there’s been talk of
  sequels and/or reboots. Truffle around the internet and you’ll find a saga to
  rival the finest in Old Norse about deals signed and projects greenlit and
  then abandoned over the years, with names attached to direct ranging from
  X-Men’s Bryan Singer to Transparent’s Joey Soloway. What a shame Soloway’s
  version never got off the ground because that surely would have been a hoot,
  and probably more interesting than this soggy, CGI-infused, low-budget
  confection that’s finally arrived. Little-known actor Matilda Lutz gets the
  lead role this time around, as well as getting all the hair extensions in the
  auburn aisle. She presents a Sonja that’s more a pixie-like hippy chick than
  Nielsen’s Valkyrie heroine, a bit of a loner who mostly kicks around the
  forest with her beloved horse. Sonja finds herself sucked, at first
  unenthusiastically, into camaraderie after she is captured by evil emperor
  Draygan (Robert Sheehan, clearly enjoying himself) and compelled to fight in
  gladiatorial combats. Sometimes her opponents are the other prisoners, and
  sometimes they are gargantuan amalgamations of pixels and VFX fairy dust,
  including a grumpy cyclops roughly the size of a tower block who is controlled
  by Draygan with what looks like a magic torch. Wallis Day plays another
  antagonist with bleached eyebrows and agonising visions of all the people
  she’s ever killed, just to show that baddies have backstories too. Indeed,
  there’s quite a lot of backstorying going on here, with lashings of flashbacks
  as we find out how Sonja came to be a lonely child of the forest, how other
  characters got roped into all this, and even what makes Draygan so mean. The
  action sequences, which are what made the original Sonja so indelible
  (especially since Nielsen had Arnold Schwarzenegger as a co-star), are a bit
  more rote. But someone somewhere must have done a punch-up on the script,
  because every now and then a reasonably witty quip arrives out of nowhere
  before the dialogue reverts to faux medieval speak. • Red Sonja is on digital
  platforms from 18 August, and on DVD &amp; Blu-ray from 8 September
