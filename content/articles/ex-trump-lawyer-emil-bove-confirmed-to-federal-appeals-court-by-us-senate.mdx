  The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Emil Bove, a top justice department official
  and former defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a federal
  appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring
  court orders. The vote broke nearly along party lines, with 50 Republican
  senators voting for his confirmation to a seat on the third circuit court of
  appeals overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin
  Islands. All Democrats opposed his nomination along with Republican senators
  Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Tennessee senator Bill Hagerty missed the
  vote. Bove’s nomination for the lifetime position has faced strident
  opposition from Democrats, after Erez Reuveni, a former justice department
  official who was fired from his post, alleged that during his time at the
  justice department, Bove told lawyers that they “would need to consider
  telling the courts ‘fuck you’ and ignore any such court order” blocking
  efforts to remove immigrants to El Salvador. In testimony before the committee
  last month, Bove denied the accusation, and Reuveni later provided text
  messages that supported his claim. Last week, another former justice
  department lawyer provided evidence to its inspector general corroborating
  Reuveni’s claim, according to Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit representing the
  person, who opted to remain anonymous. On Tuesday, the Washington Post
  reported that a third whistleblower alleged Bove misled Congress about his
  role in the dropping of corruption charges against New York City mayor Eric
  Adams. Seven veteran prosecutors resigned rather than follow orders to end the
  prosecution, which Democrats allege was done to secure Adams’s cooperation
  with Trump’s immigration policies. “Like other individuals President Trump has
  installed in the highest positions of our government during his second term,
  Mr Bove’s primary qualification appears to be his blind loyalty to this
  president,” Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee,
  said in a speech before the vote. The senator said he was trying to get a copy
  of the complaint made by the anonymous whistleblower who corroborates
  Reuveni’s allegations, and accused the GOP of pushing Bove’s nomination
  forward without fully investigating his conduct. “It appears my Republican
  colleagues fear the answers. That is the only reason I can see for their
  insistence on forcing this nomination through at breakneck speed before all
  the facts are public,” Durbin said. In addition to the whistleblower
  complaint, Democrats have criticized Bove for his role, while serving as
  acting justice department deputy attorney general, in the firings of
  prosecutors who worked on cases connected to the January 6 insurrection, as
  well as for requesting a list of FBI agents who investigated the attack.
  During his June confirmation hearing, Bove denied suggesting justice
  department lawyers defy court orders, or that political considerations played
  a role in dropping the charges against Adams. “I am not anybody’s henchman,”
  he told the committee. Democrats walked out of the committee earlier this
  month when its Republican majority voted to advance his nomination, despite
  their pleas that the whistleblower complaints be further explored.
