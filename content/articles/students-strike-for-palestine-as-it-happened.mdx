  It’s time to wind down our coverage of what has been a big day of news. Here’s
  what has been keeping us busy: Disgraced MP Gareth Ward failed in his bid to
  seek an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the
  New South Wales parliament. The convicted rapist and member for Kiama faces
  expulsion from parliament on Friday. Kathleen Folbigg was compensated with an
  undisclosed sum after she spent two decades behind bars before having her
  convictions quashed. The sum was later revealed by the NSW Greens MP Sue
  Higginson, who was heavily involved in pressuring the government to release
  Folbigg after an independent inquiry, to be $2m. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers,
  and the Productivity Commission boss, Danielle Wood, were recorded in a hot
  mic moment criticising the Australian newspaper during an event at Parliament
  House. Students in Australia’s major cities gathered to strike for Palestine
  and demand universities cut ties with weapons companies. The national class
  walkout kicked off at Sydney’s town hall at midday, with students walking from
  nearby universities carrying Palestinian flags and banners. Finally, Labor has
  cast doubt on the possibility of the Trump administration transferring an
  Iranian-born man from US immigration detention to Australia, saying it has no
  knowledge of the case. The US government is threatening to deport Reza Zavvar,
  a 52-year-old recruiter from Maryland, to either Australia or Romania. Thank
  you, as ever, for joining us today. We’ll be back bright and early tomorrow.
  Convicted rapist Gareth Ward, the member for Kiama, faces expulsion from state
  parliament on Friday after the NSW court of appeal lifted an injunction that
  had stopped the parliament acting. The government ruled out moving a motion
  tonight, as urged by the opposition, and is expected to move to expel him
  tomorrow when the Legislative Assembly sits. It is expected to be carried
  unanimously, or near unanimously, with both Labor and the Coalition indicating
  that they will support it. The parliament has power to expel a member if it is
  necessary to maintain the integrity of the parliament and to protect itself.
  It can expel a member for “unworthy conduct” that would tend to undermine the
  parliament’s reputation in the eyes of the public. But it cannot exercise the
  power to punish a member. Ward argued that expulsion was punitive because it
  would trigger a byelection and he would be further punished by losing the
  opportunity to regain his seat. NSW opposition ‘ready to have Gareth Ward
  expelled’, Liberal leader says The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, has
  responded to Gareth Ward losing his bid to seek an injunction to stop his
  parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament.
  Speakman said: The opposition is ready to have Gareth Ward expelled from
  parliament forthwith. Palestinian statehood ‘a blessing to the region’ and
  recognition should not be used as a threat, former PM says Ehud Olmert did not
  go as far as saying Gaza was in a state of starvation but said there was
  “certainly a danger of starvation if humanitarian supplies will not be
  provided adequately and comprehensively and effectively”. Speaking with the
  ABC, the former Israeli prime minister said: But the way I look at it is very
  simple, Israel is the power there. Israeli army controls Gaza. So it’s
  incumbent upon the state of Israel to make sure that the humanitarian supplies
  are provided adequately, comprehensively, without interference, in an
  effective manner, and if it’s not done, this is the responsibility of the
  Israeli government. There is no question about it. It is inconceivable,
  unacceptable and unforgivable if it is not done. He also said the idea of the
  establishment of a Palestinian state being a “punishment” to Israel was
  flawed. I believe that a solution that will involve the creation of a
  Palestinian state is a blessing to the region. Is a blessing to us and to the
  Palestinians, because it may end the historic conflict between us and them. So
  why do I need to hear from the prime minister of Australia what I think is a
  great blessing for the future of the Middle East, that it comes within the
  framework of a punishment and a threat to the Israeli government, that if you
  will not behave [yourself], then we will recognise it? I think it’s put in the
  wrong context. Disgraced MP Gareth Ward has failed in his bid to seek an
  injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New
  South Wales parliament. Ward faced an urgent hearing before the court of
  appeal on Thursday against the leader of the Legislative Assembly, Ron Hoenig.
  It came after he commenced the proceedings to seek an injunction on Monday
  night via his lawyers from Silverwater jail, where he has been remanded
  pending sentencing in September. Ward was found guilty in July of sexually
  abusing two young men in 2013 and 2015. He is appealing against his
  convictions, which include three counts of indecent assault and one for sexual
  intercourse without consent. During the hearing, Ward’s lawyer, Peter King,
  said Ward’s convictions cannot alone be considered the “unworthy conduct”
  needed as grounds to expel him from parliament. Craig Lenehan SC, who appeared
  on behalf of Hoenig, disputed this. He told the court: “It’s obviously open to
  a legislative body to form a view that a member convicted by a jury of a
  serious sex offence should be expelled. Former Israel PM says most Israelis
  not in favour of Netanyahu government’s Gaza stance Ehud Olmert says Israel is
  in crisis – and that the majority of its population does not accept its
  government’s policy on Gaza. The former Israeli prime minister spoke with the
  ABC a short time ago. He said he hoped “Israel is not a pariah state”: Israel
  is in a crisis, and the policy of the government is unacceptable to, I
  believe, the majority of Israelis. It’s not expressed yet in the policy of the
  government, because the government still enjoys the majority of the last
  elections, but it will definitely be expressed when the next elections will
  take place, hopefully soon. So this is one thing I think needs to be
  emphasised: the majority of Israelis are not in favour of what the prime
  minister is doing, and we think that the present idea of conquering all of
  Gaza is something which is not going to do any good, not to the Israeli
  hostages, and not to the prospect of ending the war, and definitely not of
  refraining from killing unnecessarily … Palestinians, which will become
  victims almost inevitably, of this military operation. Search continues for
  missing light plane and occupants off Tasmania The search for a light plane
  and its two occupants, who have been missing since Saturday afternoon, will
  continue on Friday. Tasmania police’s Insp Craig Fox said PolAir would be
  deployed for sweeps along the northern Tasmanian coastline, based on
  Australian Maritime Safety Authority drift data, police said in a statement.
  Police vessel Cape Wickham will also be deployed for search duties. This
  afternoon, Fox said: On Thursday, the police helicopter conducted sweeps of
  the Furneaux Island group including Flinders Island, Cape Barren Island and
  Chappell Island, plus other smaller islands. Unfortunately, there was no sight
  of the plane or any other factors, such as debris, which may indicate its
  potential location. Gregory Vaughan, 72, and his partner, Kim Worner, 66, from
  Deloraine, took off in a green two-seater Bristell S-LSA from George Town
  airport about 12.45pm on Saturday. They did not arrive at their destination in
  central NSW as scheduled, and family members raised the alarm on Saturday
  evening, police said. Police said there is no evidence to suggest the
  circumstances of the missing plane are suspicious. Anyone with information
  that could assist the search is urged to contact Tasmania police. Higginson:
  Folbigg compensation amount an ‘absolute slap in the face’ Sue Higginson,
  Greens MP and spokesperson for justice, has labelled the $2m ex gratia payment
  to Kathleen Folbigg, who spent 20 years in prison after being convicted of
  killing her children, before being pardoned in 2023, “an absolute slap in the
  face and a failure of the New South Wales premier to uphold the principles of
  fairness and justice in NSW”. She said a more appropriate compensation figure
  would have been 10 times the amount Folbigg has been offered by the state
  government. She said: Wrongful conviction is probably one of the most heinous
  things that the state can perpetrate on a person. The state of NSW did this to
  Kathleen Folbigg, a woman who had lost her own children. It’s hard to
  reconcile a greater crime against a woman, and that’s what happened here in
  this state. It got it wrong, and it was on Chris Minns and Michael Daly, as
  the NSW premier and the NSW attorney general, to right this wrong. And they
  have failed. Higginson said that ex gratia payments “are referred to as
  payments of grace in good faith. This offer is disgraceful and it’s been made
  in bad faith.” She said a more appropriate compensation figure would have been
  something in the order of $23m to $26m, based on the fact that Lindy
  Chamberlain received a payment of $1.3m for having served three years in
  prison. Higginson said it was within Minns’ power to correct the wrong and
  urged him to meet with Folbigg and address the issue. She also called for an
  inquiry into the ex gratia payment system, saying there was a lack of
  transparency about how decisions were reached on the dollar amount people
  received: We know that people can make an application for an ex gratia
  payment, and then things go into a kind of a Tardis, a closed door, a back
  room. It’s time to open this system. There needs to be more accountability,
  more realism, some more economic rationalism in this system, because what
  we’ve seen today is a perverse outcome. Kathleen Folbigg’s lawyer says her
  client’s ex-gratia compensation offer of $2m is “profoundly unfair and
  unjust”. Rhanee Rego said in a statement this afternoon that the “sum offered
  is a moral affront – woefully inadequate and ethically indefensible”. She
  said: The system has failed Kathleen Folbigg once again. Kathleen lost her
  four children; she lost 20 of the best years of her life; and she continues to
  feel the lasting effects of this ongoing trauma. The payment does not reflect
  the extent of the pain and suffering Kathleen has endured. This should be
  about the system recognising the significance of what it did to her. An
  inquiry is urgently needed to understand how the government decided on this
  figure. When Lindy Chamberlain was exonerated, she received $1.3m for three
  years in prison. Kathleen Folbigg spent two decades in prison, yet for her
  wrongful imprisonment she has been offered $2 million. Kathleen Folbigg’s
  fight should be over. After being failed at her conviction and abused in
  prison, she is now being treated with contempt by the very system that should
  be making amends. More on Kathleen Folbigg’s compensation. NSW Greens MP Sue
  Higginson, who was heavily involved in pressuring the government to release
  Folbigg after the independent inquiry, has revealed the New South Wales
  government compensated her just $2m. Higginson said the amount was
  “insulting”. In a statement, she said: $2m barely covers what Kathleen could
  have earned on a full-time salary over 20 years. Kathleen has not only lost 20
  years of wages, she has lost her four children, her home and her
  employability. She has racked up legal costs fighting her wrongful conviction,
  she has lost her superannuation, and she has been the victim of one of the
  worst injustices in this state’s history – wrongful imprisonment. The finance
  department has rejected a last-minute bid from three senators who urged it not
  to lift a ban on PwC Australia competing for new work with the federal
  government. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed the finance department had
  recommended the end of a long-term ban triggered by a scandal involving the
  misuse of confidential Treasury information. Former PwC Australia partners no
  longer working at the firm remain under investigation by the Australian
  federal police. Finance’s report and recommendations were due to go public on
  25 July until the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, requested the views of
  three senators who led parliamentary inquiries into the tax leaks scandal were
  taken into consideration. The three senators wrote to the department late last
  month urging it not to lift the ban, which was introduced in April 2024, while
  the tax leaks scandal was being investigated by federal police. Earlier today,
  the finance department wrote to Greens senator Barbara Pocock, Liberal senator
  Richard Colbeck, and Labor senator Deborah O’Neill to inform them that while
  their views were respected, the ban would be lifted: Finance considers that it
  would not be appropriate to delay a decision on its assessment of the ethical
  soundness of PwC Australia. PwC Australia cannot bid for consultancy work
  until 2028 due to a non-compete clause with consultancy firm Scyne, which
  bought PwC’s government consultancy wing for just $1 at the height of the
  scandal. But the firm can bid for other work including audit services. Pocock
  said she was “deeply disappointed in the government for making this decision”:
  The government decision to let PwC back into the contracting consulting fold
  is an insult to the Senators and MPs who worked on two parliamentary inquiries
  examining what went wrong at PwC. We made a raft of recommendations which have
  yet to be enacted, while the government renews its contracting relationship
  with this disgraced entity. Chaney says proposal for GST review is about
  ‘tough conversations’ Kate Chaney says her proposal to review GST is about
  having “tough conversations” and not simply talking about tax cuts. The
  independent MP has just told ABC that as a “big part of our tax picture”, GST
  needs to be reviewed. “We’ve had no tax reform really in 20 years. And it’s a
  good tax. It’s efficient, it’s transparent, it’s simple,” she said. She said
  her plan meant “people who consume more, and who spend more, end up paying
  more tax” and ensured lower income earners were not penalised: We need leaders
  who are actually going to have the tough conversations, not only talk about
  tax cuts. At the moment, talking about any changes to the GST is just taboo.
  And we’re never going to have serious reform if we can’t even start the
  conversation. SA Greens urge premier to protect public servants’ right to work
  from home for South Australian Greens are urging the premier, Peter
  Malinauskas, to join them in legislating working from home protections for
  public sector workers. The Greens’ plan to introduce a private member’s bill
  would set guardrails to protect the right to work from home for one day a week
  for SA workers whose role can reasonably and practically be performed
  remotely, the Greens said in a statement. On Monday, Malinauskas told ABC
  Radio he did not support protecting work from home rights in law, despite the
  Victorian Labor government announcing plans to legislate a two-day WFH
  entitlement, they said. Robert Simms, SA Greens leader said: Workers are being
  stretched, and the Greens’ work from home bill will help them. This will mean
  more money in the pockets of workers and more time for your life, family and
  friends – while costing employers nothing. I urge the premier to embrace this
  opportunity to work with the Greens and avoid the perception that the Labor
  government is out of touch with modern workplaces. If the government fails to
  act, I have no doubt this will become a key issue for the next state election.
  Chalmers caught criticising News Corp in hot mic moment The treasurer, Jim
  Chalmers, and the Productivity Commission boss, Danielle Wood, have been
  recorded criticising the Australian newspaper during an event at Parliament
  House. The pair were preparing for a meeting of the treasurer’s investor
  roundtable on Wednesday when they were recorded discussing coverage of the
  upcoming productivity summit in the News Corp masthead. Neither appeared aware
  there were live microphones around them. Footage picked up by one of the news
  cameras given access to the start of the event showed Chalmers said the
  newspaper had “basically done a headline of the opposite of what I’d said”.
  Wood responded: “They’re getting so many things factually wrong.” Chalmers
  then said: “Deliberately so.” The government is continuing to roll out a
  series of pre-roundtable meetings ahead of the main talks in Canberra starting
  on 19 August. Chalmers, Wood and News Corp have been contacted for comment.
  Kathleen Folbigg has been compensated with an undisclosed sum after she spent
  two decades behind bars before having her convictions quashed. Folbigg was
  convicted in 2003 and ordered to serve a minimum 25-year sentence for the
  suffocation murders of three of her children and manslaughter of a fourth. She
  was granted an unconditional pardon and released from prison in June 2023
  after an independent inquiry which heard new scientific evidence that
  indicated her children may have died from natural causes or a genetic
  mutation. In December 2023, the appeals court upheld the inquiry’s findings to
  formally overturn her convictions and clear her name. On Thursday, the
  attorney-general, Michael Daley, said in a statement: The Attorney General has
  decided to make an ex-gratia payment to Kathleen Folbigg following her
  application. The decision follows thorough and extensive consideration of the
  materials and issues raised in Ms Folbigg’s application and provided by her
  legal representatives. At Ms Folbigg’s request, the Attorney General and
  Government have agreed to not publicly discuss the details of the decision.
  Legal experts had told Guardian Australia in 2023 that Folbigg should receive
  the biggest compensation payout in Australian history because no other
  wrongful conviction had caused as much harm. Opposition attorney-general
  spokesperson says tech platforms cannot steal the work of Australian artists
  without paying Federal coalition frontbencher Julian Leeser has called for
  Australian artists to be financially protected from a potential loosening of
  AI regulation. It comes after the Productivity Commission used an interim
  report to warn against the overregulation of AI. The commission is examining
  whether technology firms should be exempt from copyright rules that stop
  companies mining text and data to train AI models. Leeser, the opposition’s
  attorney-general spokesperson, said Australian artists and creatives should
  not be sold out to AI: If tech companies profit from the work of Australian
  artists and creatives, they should pay fair compensation, just like any other
  person. In the real world, we wouldn’t let someone use an artist’s work for
  commercial purposes without paying for it. The virtual world should be no
  different. Thank you, Nick Visser. I’m Daisy Dumas and I’ll be with you for
  the remainder of this Thursday’s live news coverage. Let’s get going. That’s
  all for me, thanks for sticking with us today. The talented Daisy Dumas will
  be your shepherd through this afternoon’s news. Students converge on NSW Labor
  party offices in Sydney Students have converged on the New South Wales Labor
  party offices in Sydney’s Sussex Street after several hundred gathered at the
  Town Hall this afternoon to call for an end to suffering in Gaza. The students
  are chanting “Penny Wong you will see, Palestine will be free” and “Chris
  Minns you will see, Palestine will be free”. The deputy Greens leader and
  higher education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, was among those in attendance
  at the Town Hall. She told students on social media they had her “full
  permission” to skip class to attend the rally. Police in NSW said no arrests
  had been made as a result of the strike. Meanwhile, students in Melbourne have
  begun their walk-off at the city’s State Library after gathering at several
  university campuses, including the University of Melbourne. Update: there are,
  in fact, some under-40s on the economic roundtable this month We reported
  earlier that the Intergenerational Fairness Coalition was demanding at least
  two under-40s at Jim Chalmers’ reform roundtable later this month. Turns out
  their wishes have already been granted. Guardian Australia asked around and
  there are at least two participants in their 30s: Cassandra Winzar, the chief
  economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia; and Joseph
  Mitchell, an assistant secretary at the ACTU. Victorian losses on pokies jump
  to record high Victorians lost $3.14bn on poker machines in the 2024-25
  financial year, a $115m jump from the previous reporting period and a record
  high. The Alliance for Gambling Reform said the spike in gambling losses on
  the pokies also came in a year when venues had changed operating hours that
  should have, in fact, led to a drop in losses. Uniform venue closing hours
  were in effect for all but two months of the last financial year. Martin
  Thomas, the CEO of the alliance, said: The new figures are appalling and
  represent devastating social harm across the state, not just financial loss,
  but in health and mental health conditions, marriage breakup, it exacerbates
  domestic violence and can lead to severe depression and suicide. This harm is
  actually becoming more acute as the figures show the number of people playing
  poker machines in Victoria has halved in the last 15 years. So there are fewer
  people who are being impacted. The alliance notes that in 2008, 21.5% of
  Victorians were gambling on poker machines. In 2023, that number dropped to
  just 10.7%. Dozens more countries face higher taxes on exports to US as new
  Trump tariffs come into effect Dozens of countries face higher taxes on their
  exports to the US now that Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific
  tariffs have come into force. The sweeping “reciprocal” levies announced by
  the White House a week ago – just before a previous 1 August deadline was due
  to elapse – were in place as of a minute past midnight Washington time on
  Thursday. Just before midnight, Trump claimed on social media that billions of
  dollars would start flowing into the US as a result of the tariffs. He wrote:
  The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court
  that wants to see our country fail. Read more here: Penny Wong complained to
  China about intimidation of exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners Foreign
  affairs minister Penny Wong directly complained about the targeted
  intimidation of exiled pro-democracy campaigners from Hong Kong to her Chinese
  counterpart, Wang Yi, during a bilateral meeting in Kuala Lumpur. The July
  meeting was the first face-to-face discussion between the pair since two Hong
  Kong activists wanted for alleged national security crimes were subjected to
  anonymous letters offering Australian neighbours $203,000 to inform on them.
  The letters are now being investigated by the countering foreign interference
  taskforce, which is led by Australia’s federal police and the domestic
  intelligence agency. Government sources confirmed Wong privately reiterated
  her public criticism of the targeting of Adelaide-based Ted Hui and
  Melbourne-based Kevin Yam. Her office previously described their treatment as
  “reprehensible” and a threat to “our national sovereignty”. Read more here:
  Tasmania premier says state has spoken after snap election and he expects
  ‘common sense’ to prevail Jeremy Rockliff, who was returned as Tasmania’s
  premier yesterday, at least until the state’s parliament returns on 19 August,
  said he is not expecting to lose a no-confidence motion threatened by
  opposition leader Dean Winter. Rockliff spoke to the press after announcing
  his new cabinet in Launceston this afternoon, saying: I am expecting to go to
  parliament and for common sense to prevail. The people have spoken. … What the
  election said and the people of Tasmania clearly demonstrated is that they are
  sick and tired of the political games. Mr Winter continues to play political
  games … What I’m about is ensuring that I can learn from the previous
  parliament and engage with the crossbench for the benefit of Tasmanians.
  Rockliff was adamant that there will not be another election. Twelve judges
  resigned from Queensland writers award after intervention over Gaza tweets 12
  judges resigned from the panels governing a Queensland writers award after
  First Nations writer Karen Wyld was stripped of a fellowship over tweets about
  the war in Gaza. State Library of Queensland chief, Vicki McDonald, revealed
  about a third of its 34 black&amp;write! writing fellowship judges had
  resigned after it was directed to withdraw the win by the minister in May.
  Arts minister John-Paul Langbroek said he “took action to uphold the integrity
  of publicly funded cultural institutions”. He said: I made it very clear that
  any perception that taxpayer funded awards are being granted to individuals
  who express views that justified terrorism undermines public confidence in our
  institutions and the broader cultural center sector. I will not rule out
  taking similar action in the future, if it is deemed necessary. If they choose
  not to be judges again, we will find other judges. Estimates also heard that
  the Queensland Performing Arts Centre board had recommended naming its new
  $184m theatre after an Indigenous Queenslander, particularly Indigenous poet
  and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal. Instead the state government put the decision
  to a public vote, with five options: Glasshouse theatre, Lantern theatre,
  Watershed theatre and Russell Street theatre, or suggest an alternative. It is
  to be called the Glasshouse theatre. Academic who had Palestinian flag removed
  from University of Sydney office applies to fly it again An academic who had a
  Palestinian flag removed from outside his office by the University of Sydney
  for breaching its new flag policy has applied for approval to fly the flag
  “for as long as Israel continues its genocide of the Palestinians”. Dr David
  Brophy, a senior lecturer in modern Chinese history, had been advised by the
  university its display breached the policy’s clause 2.8(1), which states that
  unapproved flags can be displayed in such areas on a temporary basis only. In
  a response to the university’s statement, Brophy said he had written to the
  vice-chancellor and the “Brand Team” for approval “to fly the same flag, from
  the same place, for as long as Israel continues its genocide of the
  Palestinians. I hope they’ll let me do it”. He said: It was always intended as
  a temporary gesture, until such time as Israel ends its genocide and withdraws
  from the Gaza Strip. Brophy said he was “glad” for one part of the
  university’s statement, which confirmed “we expect Palestinian flags to
  continue to feature on our campus”. “That’s something we can agree on,” Brophy
  said. Since Brophy’s flag was removed, three more Palestinian flags have
  appeared hanging from university buildings. A spokesperson for the University
  of Sydney said it would “assess any flags on campus in line with the flag
  policy”. This post has been updated to include the university’s response.
  Conviction for a ‘serious sex offence’ should be grounds for expulsion from
  parliament, Ron Hoenig’s lawyers argue Returning to the urgent hearing before
  the court of appeal right now after convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward sought an
  injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New
  South Wales parliament. The lawyer acting for the leader of the Legislative
  Assembly has disputed the Kiama MP’s assertion that his conviction alone is
  not “unworthy conduct”, and therefore parliament does not have grounds to
  undertake a vote on whether to expel him. Craig Lenehan, who is acting for
  Labor MP Ron Hoenig, argued: It’s obviously open to a legislative body to form
  a view that a member convicted by a jury of a serious sex offence should be
  expelled. He said the motion to expel Ward is not “some sort of illicit
  punitive purpose”, as argued by Ward’s lawyer, Peter King. Lenehan said:
  Nothing in the evidence suggests any such thing. Greens’ Nick McKim: ‘the best
  idea the teals can come up with is to make food more expensive?’ It’s not
  often that we see members of the crossbench take shots at each other, when
  they more often team up to push the government on various matters. McKim
  added: If we want to make people’s lives better we should make big
  corporations pay their fair share of tax and use the revenue to provide
  genuine cost of living relief. Since the pandemic the cost of essentials has
  skyrocketed, and the best idea the teals can come up with is to make food more
  expensive? McKim went on to claim “the teals want to hike up taxes on baby
  formula and electricity.” If we are serious about easing cost of living
  pressures we should be making big corporations and the super wealthy pay their
  fair share of tax. One in three of the biggest corporations pays no tax at
  all. The ultra-wealthy stash billions in trusts and tax shelters. Greens blast
  Kate Chaney’s GST idea as ‘lazy’ It’s a crossbench clash as the Greens accuse
  independent Kate Chaney of a “lazy idea” to raise the GST. Greens economic
  spokesperson Nick McKim shared a media statement titled “Teals’ GST plan shows
  warped priorities”. Referring to Chaney as a “teal” several times, in a rather
  critical takedown of her plan, McKim decried her idea, which he claimed would
  “jack up the GST and apply it to fresh food and utilities”. Instead the Greens
  are pushing their own plan to raise taxes on wealthy Australians and big
  businesses. McKim said: Kate Chaney’s plan to raise the GST to 15% and apply
  it to fresh food and utilities is a lazy idea. Students in Australia’s major
  cities are gathering to strike for Palestine and demand universities cut ties
  with weapons companies. The national class walkout kicked off at Sydney’s town
  hall at midday, with students walking from nearby universities carrying
  Palestinian flags and banners. Students are converging at Melbourne’s state
  library at 2pm, while Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Wollongong are
  also holding disruptions and sit-ins. The strike has been endorsed by the
  National Union of Students and the National Tertiary Education Union. On
  Thursday afternoon, students from the University of Sydney marched to the town
  hall carrying a banner reading: “There are no universities left in Gaza” and
  chanting “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”. Some
  universities have informed students they will not be penalised for attending
  the rallies, while others have urged participants to talk to their course
  conveners in advance. A bold proposal to give Australians an extra $3,300 per
  year in exchange for a rise in the goods and services tax is being treated
  with caution by the major parties, AAP reports. Independent MP Kate Chaney
  calls for the implementation of a “progressive GST model” as the federal
  government looks for ways to reinvigorate Australia’s languishing productivity
  and strengthen the budget at an economic roundtable. Under the plan, first
  proposed by economist Richard Holden, Australia would lift the rate of the
  consumption tax from 10 to 15% and apply it to exempt items such as food,
  education and health. But to mitigate the impact on those with lower incomes,
  all Australians aged 18 and older would be given a $3,300 rebate, meaning they
  would effectively pay no GST on the first $22,000 of their annual expenses.
  Cheney said: The major parties like to talk about tax cuts and spending but
  they’re less willing to discuss where the money will come from. We have to
  have courageous conversations about other revenue sources to avoid handballing
  this problem to future generations. Under-40s and the economic roundtable In
  hyping his talkfest back in June, Chalmers said “the decisions we make in the
  2020s will determine the sort of living standards and intergenerational
  justice that we have in the decades to come”. And younger Australians have
  plenty to worry about. Unaffordable homes, soaring student debt programs, the
  burden of higher taxes to pay for an ageing population and fears that AI will
  crush their careers – all threaten to leave the current generation with lower
  living standards than their parents. Then there’s the more existential threat
  from climate change. But, as Jane Body from the Intergenerational Fairness
  Coalition notes, the reform roundtable agenda also doesn’t find space for a
  specific session on intergenerational issues. • This post was updated on 7
  August 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated that there were no
  participants in the roundtable under 40 and said Jane Body called for at least
  two under-40 representatives to be added to the list of conference attendees.
  Please see our update here. Qantas has devalued its frequent flyer points.
  What should you do now? Qantas was back in the spotlight this week with news
  that affected members of its frequent flyer program. The airline has made
  significant changes to its loyalty program, effectively devaluing its frequent
  flyer points. Qantas has announced changes to its loyalty program. But will
  they benefit frequent flyers – and are members better off spending their

  The vacancy rate for Australian office buildings is at the highest level in
  three decades, according to new figures from the Australian Property Council.
  The body released new data today finding office vacancies had risen from 14.7%
  to 15.2% nationally. Mike Zorbas, the chief of the council, said many tenants
  were increasingly opting for premium offices that have been hitting the market
  in greater numbers. Those upper-tier choices have seen a year and a half of
  positive growth, while lower-grade choices had seen falling occupancy rates.
  The council notes that offices are graded on levels of quality, with premium
  and A grade the highest and B, C and D grades considered of “secondary”
  quality. Zorbas said in a statement: Tenants are capitalising on opportunities
  to occupy premium buildings in prime CBD locations, with premium space
  continuing to see higher demand levels than lower-grade buildings. Much of
  this demand is centred on Premium and A Grade buildings, with B, C and D grade
  office buildings experiencing negative demand over the last six months. Gareth
  Ward’s lawyer has argued the MP for Kiama’s convictions cannot alone be
  considered the “unworthy conduct” needed as grounds to expel him from
  parliament. Ward was found guilty in July of sexually abusing two young men in
  2013 and 2015. He is appealing his convictions, which include three counts of
  indecent assault and one for sexual intercourse without consent. Ward’s
  barrister, Peter King, said: It’s not, in our respectful submission, justice
  according to law to say to someone, ‘well you’ve been convicted, we’re now
  going to punish you by expelling you from the parliament’. We submit that the
  [common law] privilege doesn’t work that way. King said the four convictions
  cannot alone be the basis for the expulsion given the judicial process is yet
  to conclude, and that the government has identified no other “unworthy
  conduct” in its reasons to expel him. If he’s acquitted, and he’s lost all the
  rights that an innocent man would otherwise have, his career has been trashed.
  Chief justice Andrew Bell – one of the three judges overseeing the matter –
  interjected to say the criminal convictions were serious. Bell said: “He’s
  had, as you say, a nine-week trial, and he’s been convicted by 12 of his
  fellow citizens.” King later compared Ward’s absence from parliament to
  someone who has a “serious malady or illness or cancer or something” and
  cannot attend parliament for nine months. Continuing from previous post:
  Documents provided by US authorities suggest Zavvar could be sent to Australia
  or Romania, despite Zavvar having no links to either place. He has never lived
  in either country. Guardian Australia approached the home affairs minister,
  Tony Burke, and the foreign minister, Penny Wong, for an explanation about the
  case, but Labor says it has not been approached by the United States in
  relation to it. A government spokesperson said there was no new agreement for
  transfer of US immigration detainees to Australia. They said: We consider any
  application for a visa on its merits, we have not been contacted by the US
  government about this matter. There have been no new agreements made with the
  Trump Administration on immigration. Trump administration threatens to deport
  Iranian man to Australia Labor has cast doubt on the possibility of the Trump
  administration transferring an Iranian-born man from US immigration detention
  to Australia, saying it has no knowledge of the case. The US government is
  threatening to deport Reza Zavvar, a 52-year-old recruiter from Maryland, to
  either Australia or Romania. Zavvar is being held in detention, despite
  holding a US immigration green card, due to a historical conviction for
  marijuana possession which dates back to the 1990s. Zavvar cannot be sent back
  to Iran due to risk of persecution there, and his lawyer Ava Benach says he
  has been told he could be sent to a third country. The Trump administration
  has taken a hard line on deporting non-citizens from the US, often to
  countries in South America. The deportation policy has seen people arrested
  without warning by federal officials around the US, and has sparked a series
  of legal challenges. Albanese was asked about his position on work-from-home
  after Victoria premier Jacinta Allan outlined plans to legislate flexible
  working rights. The prime minister said during a press conference today: We
  think that working from home and flexible working arrangements can benefit
  both workers and employers. And during the election campaign … the Coalition
  promised, of course, to send people back to the office five days a week. That
  ended up with some of them not having an office any more. I think that
  flexible working arrangements benefit both workers and employers. When asked
  if he would support a legislated right to work from home on a federal level,
  Albanese said Labor had already amended the Fair Work Act in 2022 with the
  Secure Jobs, Better Pay amendment. Jacinta Allan is Victorian premier. She’s
  putting forward her views. I’ve got to say it’s consistent with our views,
  which are that working from home is something that’s important, something that
  Australians voted for, something that Peter Dutton tried to clamp down on, and
  Australians responded accordingly. Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward is facing
  an urgent court hearing this morning after he sought an injunction to stop his
  parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament.
  Ward’s barrister, Peter King, is providing his arguments now before the three
  judge bench in the court of appeal. King argued the NSW Legislative Assembly
  was seeking to expel Ward via a “kangaroo court” because Ward’s “existing
  right as a member of the assembly to speak in the debate to oppose the
  resolution is lost”. Ward, the independent MP for Kiama, is in Silverwater
  jail, where he has been remanded pending sentencing in September. King told
  the court this was one of a number of reasons why he would argue the
  government’s resolution to expel Ward was “punitive in nature”. Another reason
  he argued it was punitive was because Ward’s expulsion would trigger a
  byelection and “he’s further punished in that respect, by losing the
  opportunity to regain his seat”. A judge interjected to say Ward’s inability
  to attend parliament and oppose the resolution was “driven entirely” by the
  fact he applied for bail but was refused. King responded the difficulty was
  the resolution being “brought on hurriedly” and in “circumstances in which it
  means that his existing right as a member of the assembly to speak in the
  debate to oppose the resolution is lost.” The prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, and the health minister, Mark Butler, are in Melbourne to speak
  about the government’s efforts to open 50 Medicare urgent care clinics. The
  prime minister told media of three new clinics in Victoria: When you need
  healthcare, you can get it and you can get it for free. That is why this is so
  important going forward. My government is really proud that we’re doing this.
  We want to see, if possible, our objective of the 50 urgent care clinics,
  additional [ones] opened as soon as possible. Certainly within a year, but
  we’ll see how we go about how many we can get open in 2025. My government is
  determined that this will be a year of delivery – delivery on the commitments
  which Australians voted for. The three existing clinics in Warrnambool,
  Sunshine and Warragul were state-funded urgent care services, but have been
  brought in to the federal urgent care clinic network. Nine new clinics will be
  established in Victoria between 2025 and 2026. Butler said the new urgent care
  clinics were already taking pressure off hospital emergency departments,
  saying eventually four in five Australians will live within a 20-minute drive
  to an urgent care clinic. Butler said: It’s taking pressure off the hospital
  system, it’s providing people with that option for care seven days a week,
  extended hours, and fully bulk-billed. And it’s a central part of our
  strengthening Medicare agenda. Search for missing plane enters sixth day along
  Tasmania’s coast Tasmania Police are continuing the search for a small plane
  that went missing on Saturday after leaving the state’s George Town airport.
  Two people – identified as Gregory Vaughan, 72, and his partner, Kim Worner,
  66 – were on board, along with their dog, travelling to regional NSW. A police
  helicopter will search the coastline along northern Tasmania today after early
  searches found no sign of the light sport plane. No boats have been able to
  join the hunt since Tuesday due to challenging weather conditions and no new
  search areas have been identified. The matter is now part of an active
  investigation, officials said. Police said previously there has been no
  contact with the couple, or their plane, since it left the George Town airport
  near Tasmania’s north coast. Parts of central NSW still under evacuation
  orders as flood waters move downstream Some residents in the towns of Gunnedah
  and Narrabri remain under flood evacuation orders after last weekend’s heavy
  rain. The NSW SES notes 20 emergency warnings are active in parts of NSW,
  including 16 “evacuate now” alerts. About 2,200 volunteers have responded to
  more than 2,600 incidents since the latest weather event began, with 40 flood
  rescues so far. Officials said on social media those threats remain for those
  along the Namoi River at Wee Waa: The Namoi River at Wee Waa is continuing to
  rise and the flood risk in the town is increasing today and NSW SES has
  prepositioned crews and assets in the affected areas in preparation. SES
  officials urge residents in potentially impacted areas to stay up-to-date with
  the HazardWatch app. Some electric cars fall short of claimed range by up to
  23% A government-funded program to test the true performance of vehicles has
  found the driving range of five popular electric cars is between 5% and 23%
  lower than results from laboratory testing. The Australian Automobile
  Association tested vehicles from Tesla, BYD, Kia and Smart – the first EVs to
  be put through its four-year, federally funded Real World Testing Program to
  give consumers more accurate information on vehicle performance. The extended
  range variant of the BYD Atto3 had the largest discrepancy, according to the
  AAA, with a real-world range of 369km, 23% lower than the 480km achieved in
  laboratory testing. The Smart #3 had the lowest, with only a 5% difference.
  The Tesla Model 3 had a real-world range 14% lower than the lab test. Tesla’s
  Model Y and the Kia EV6 both had a real world range 8% lower. Read more here:
  National Union of Students calls for student referendum on Palestine The
  National Union of Students is endorsing a national student referendum on
  Palestine, and will poll students on whether to pass motions censuring the
  Australian government and their universities amid the ongoing war in Gaza. The
  union said mass meetings of students will take place at campuses across the
  country from 20 to 28 August, where those gathered will debate two motions.
  One includes students censuring the Australian government for its “complicity
  in the genocide in Gaza”, including a demand to end all weapons sales to
  Israel. The other calls on Australian universities to end their partnerships
  with weapons companies. James McVicar, the education officer for the union,
  said in a statement: In the face of our own government’s complicity in the
  crime of genocide, students are standing up and demanding to be counted. The
  National Student Referendum on Palestine will be a chance for students across
  the country to vote no confidence in our government and demand an end to
  weapons companies on our campuses. Hundreds more jobs could be axed at
  Australia’s national science agency, sparking concerns the country is gutting
  its research capability just as the Trump administration makes deep cuts into
  the sector in the US. The latest potential research job losses at the
  Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) follow
  440 positions being cut last financial year and earlier deep reductions under
  the Coalition government, including 300 in 2016. They coincide with the Trump
  administration slashing science agencies in the US, with warnings the loss of
  expertise could have global ramifications in health, climate science and
  weather forecasting. Read more: Peak welfare body calls for property tax
  breaks to be rolled back before productivity roundtable The Australian Council
  of Social Services (Acoss) says the government should roll back tax breaks for
  property investors, the latest major body to do so ahead of the treasurer’s
  productivity roundtable later this month. Acoss, the nation’s peak welfare
  body, says the capital gains tax should be halved and negative gearing should
  be limited. There should also be a commonwealth royalty payment for offshore
  gas, the group says, adding revenue generated by those changes should be
  invested in social housing. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of Acoss,
  told the ABC: We are very clear we would phase out the very generous 50% tax
  discount and get it down to 25%. So there’d be some tax reward for property
  investment, but nowhere near as generous. On Sunday, the head of the
  Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, also called for changes to
  the capital gains tax and negative gearing. She said at the time bold reforms
  were needed to help younger people, saying it was time for the country to
  “bite the bullet” on the ABC. The NSW parliament will introduce legislation to
  strengthen laws surrounding the creation and distribution of intimate and
  sexually explicit deepfake images, as well as criminalise the creation and
  distribution of sexually explicit audio. If passed, the expanded law would
  encompass sexually explicit content created entirely using artificial
  intelligence. It is already a crime in NSW to record or distribute intimate
  images of a person without their consent, including those that have been
  digitally altered. The amendments will see the production of a sexually
  explicit deepfake meant to depict a real, identifiable person become an
  offence subject to a punishment of three years in jail. Anyone convicted of
  sharing or threatening to share deepfake images, even if the person hasn’t
  created them, will also be punishable by up to three years in jail. NSW
  attorney general, Michael Daley, said the changes would close a gap in the law
  that leaves women vulnerable to “AI-generated sexual exploitation”. He added
  to media: These images can look very, very real. They can also be very, very
  harmful. And their prevalence is well on the increase. Almost all of the
  images circulating online are pornographic in nature. 99% of them are images
  of girls and women. One signatory says Gaza letter represents ‘strong, shared
  frustration’ at furrowed brows over action Peter Rodgers, a former ambassador
  to Israel, said the letter represents a call to action after a long period of
  “worried looks”. He told RN Breakfast this morning: I think there’s a strong,
  shared frustration, and indeed anger, at all the furrowed brows and the
  expressions of deep concern, growing concern, etc. etc, and very little
  action. And so I think that’s what this letter represents. It is time for
  action, not just worried looks. Rodgers said arguments the recognition of a
  Palestinian state would embolden Hamas were “nonsensical”, saying not doing so
  actually rewarded Israel’s campaign: It rewards the government of Benjamin
  Netanyahu for its campaign of genocidal violence in Gaza, for its campaign of
  ethnic cleansing and apartheid in the West Bank. And so it’s a nonsensical
  argument. The problem here is, certainly on the Palestinian side, there are
  some very nasty people. On the Israeli side, there are also nasty people … I
  think we need to be very careful of pointing the finger in one direction and
  forgetting what’s going on the other side. A group of former Australian
  ambassadors and diplomats have urged prime minister Anthony Albanese to do
  more to see the end of Israel’s war in Gaza, including the recognition of a
  Palestinian state. The coalition includes former ambassador to Israel, Peter
  Rodgers, former diplomat, Alison Broinowski, Australia’s first ambassador to
  China, Stephen FitzGerald and former ambassador to Japan, John Menadue. The
  letter says the recognition of a Palestinian state is deeply important as
  repeated calls for a two-state solution make “no sense when only one state
  exists, and that heavily-armed state, Israel, is engaged in apartheid, war
  crimes, and potential genocide of almost totally defenceless people”. The
  letter, sent Monday, reads in part: We are distressed that Australia has done
  so little to prevent the progressive erosion of international law, the
  persistent armed assaults on Palestinian people, and the violation of their
  human rights in Gaza and the West Bank. We acknowledge your statements,
  together with other leaders, about the need for cautious consideration of
  recognition of a Palestinian state, and about the need for a two-state
  solution. Your approach is supported by a growing number of Australians, of
  Jewish, Palestinian, and other backgrounds. This process, while welcome, is
  far too slow. It is taking more time than the famine-affected people of Gaza
  and the displaced Palestinians of the West Bank have, if they are to survive.
  Time is of the essence for them. You can read the full text of the open letter
  here. Treasurer says Australia can be ‘big player’ in future of data centres
  Chalmers was also asked about the former CEO of Atlassian, who recently said
  he wants to see Australia host massive data centres and see a change in the
  copyright law to allow exemptions for data mining for AI companies. Chalmers
  said the data centres were “a major opportunity” for Australia, adding: As it
  turns out, I’ve spent a few hours this afternoon with $3tn of Australian
  capital, the biggest investors in Australia, super and other institutional
  investors, we’ve been grappling with this question: how does Australia make
  the most of this opportunity when it comes to data centres and AI
  infrastructure more broadly? We have got a big chance, we’ll be mad not to
  grab it. We need to get the energy piece right, the zoning approvals piece
  right, the skills piece right as well. We can be a big player in data centres.
  Chalmers says he will err on the side of workers when it comes to AI The
  treasurer, Jim Chalmers, appeared on 7.30 last night, where he was talking
  about how AI will be a key topic at the government’s productivity roundtable
  in a few weeks. He was asked if he would support the Australian Council of
  Trade Unions’ call for workers to be able to veto AI in their workplace. He
  said he would err on the side of workers: We need to be realistic about it.
  And certainly, I agree that workers need to be part of the conversation when
  it comes to rolling out a technology that has this game-changing potential.
  And where there’s very real potential risks in the labour market. I would
  always err on the side of workers having a say in how their work is done. Good
  morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Nick Visser, I’ll be bringing
  you updates as the day gets rolling. Let’s start with this: The Australian
  Council of Social Services (Acoss) is calling for the government to roll back
  tax breaks for property investors before the treasurer’s productivity
  roundtable. Acoss is calling for the 50% capital gains tax discount to be
  halved “so there’d be some tax reward for property investment but nowhere near
  as generous”, the group’s chief told the ABC. Also today, a court is expected
  to hear jailed MP Gareth Ward’s bid to prevent the NSW parliament from
  expelling him. We’ll bring you all the developments. Stick with us.

It’s time to wind down our coverage of what has been a big day of news. Here’s what has been keeping us busy: Disgraced MP Gareth Ward failed in his bid to seek an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament. The convicted rapist and member for Kiama faces expulsion from parliament on Friday. Kathleen Folbigg was compensated with an undisclosed sum after she spent two decades behind bars before having her convictions quashed. The sum was later revealed by the NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson, who was heavily involved in pressuring the government to release Folbigg after an independent inquiry, to be $2m. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the Productivity Commission boss, Danielle Wood, were recorded in a hot mic moment criticising the Australian newspaper during an event at Parliament House. Students in Australia’s major cities gathered to strike for Palestine and demand universities cut ties with weapons companies. The national class walkout kicked off at Sydney’s town hall at midday, with students walking from nearby universities carrying Palestinian flags and banners. Finally, Labor has cast doubt on the possibility of the Trump administration transferring an Iranian-born man from US immigration detention to Australia, saying it has no knowledge of the case. The US government is threatening to deport Reza Zavvar, a 52-year-old recruiter from Maryland, to either Australia or Romania. Thank you, as ever, for joining us today. We’ll be back bright and early tomorrow. Convicted rapist Gareth Ward, the member for Kiama, faces expulsion from state parliament on Friday after the NSW court of appeal lifted an injunction that had stopped the parliament acting. The government ruled out moving a motion tonight, as urged by the opposition, and is expected to move to expel him tomorrow when the Legislative Assembly sits. It is expected to be carried unanimously, or near unanimously, with both Labor and the Coalition indicating that they will support it. The parliament has power to expel a member if it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the parliament and to protect itself. It can expel a member for “unworthy conduct” that would tend to undermine the parliament’s reputation in the eyes of the public. But it cannot exercise the power to punish a member. Ward argued that expulsion was punitive because it would trigger a byelection and he would be further punished by losing the opportunity to regain his seat. NSW opposition ‘ready to have Gareth Ward expelled’, Liberal leader says The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, has responded to Gareth Ward losing his bid to seek an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament. Speakman said: The opposition is ready to have Gareth Ward expelled from parliament forthwith. Palestinian statehood ‘a blessing to the region’ and recognition should not be used as a threat, former PM says Ehud Olmert did not go as far as saying Gaza was in a state of starvation but said there was “certainly a danger of starvation if humanitarian supplies will not be provided adequately and comprehensively and effectively”. Speaking with the ABC, the former Israeli prime minister said: But the way I look at it is very simple, Israel is the power there. Israeli army controls Gaza. So it’s incumbent upon the state of Israel to make sure that the humanitarian supplies are provided adequately, comprehensively, without interference, in an effective manner, and if it’s not done, this is the responsibility of the Israeli government. There is no question about it. It is inconceivable, unacceptable and unforgivable if it is not done. He also said the idea of the establishment of a Palestinian state being a “punishment” to Israel was flawed. I believe that a solution that will involve the creation of a Palestinian state is a blessing to the region. Is a blessing to us and to the Palestinians, because it may end the historic conflict between us and them. So why do I need to hear from the prime minister of Australia what I think is a great blessing for the future of the Middle East, that it comes within the framework of a punishment and a threat to the Israeli government, that if you will not behave [yourself], then we will recognise it? I think it’s put in the wrong context. Disgraced MP Gareth Ward has failed in his bid to seek an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament. Ward faced an urgent hearing before the court of appeal on Thursday against the leader of the Legislative Assembly, Ron Hoenig. It came after he commenced the proceedings to seek an injunction on Monday night via his lawyers from Silverwater jail, where he has been remanded pending sentencing in September. Ward was found guilty in July of sexually abusing two young men in 2013 and 2015. He is appealing against his convictions, which include three counts of indecent assault and one for sexual intercourse without consent. During the hearing, Ward’s lawyer, Peter King, said Ward’s convictions cannot alone be considered the “unworthy conduct” needed as grounds to expel him from parliament. Craig Lenehan SC, who appeared on behalf of Hoenig, disputed this. He told the court: “It’s obviously open to a legislative body to form a view that a member convicted by a jury of a serious sex offence should be expelled. Former Israel PM says most Israelis not in favour of Netanyahu government’s Gaza stance Ehud Olmert says Israel is in crisis – and that the majority of its population does not accept its government’s policy on Gaza. The former Israeli prime minister spoke with the ABC a short time ago. He said he hoped “Israel is not a pariah state”: Israel is in a crisis, and the policy of the government is unacceptable to, I believe, the majority of Israelis. It’s not expressed yet in the policy of the government, because the government still enjoys the majority of the last elections, but it will definitely be expressed when the next elections will take place, hopefully soon. So this is one thing I think needs to be emphasised: the majority of Israelis are not in favour of what the prime minister is doing, and we think that the present idea of conquering all of Gaza is something which is not going to do any good, not to the Israeli hostages, and not to the prospect of ending the war, and definitely not of refraining from killing unnecessarily … Palestinians, which will become victims almost inevitably, of this military operation. Search continues for missing light plane and occupants off Tasmania The search for a light plane and its two occupants, who have been missing since Saturday afternoon, will continue on Friday. Tasmania police’s Insp Craig Fox said PolAir would be deployed for sweeps along the northern Tasmanian coastline, based on Australian Maritime Safety Authority drift data, police said in a statement. Police vessel Cape Wickham will also be deployed for search duties. This afternoon, Fox said: On Thursday, the police helicopter conducted sweeps of the Furneaux Island group including Flinders Island, Cape Barren Island and Chappell Island, plus other smaller islands. Unfortunately, there was no sight of the plane or any other factors, such as debris, which may indicate its potential location. Gregory Vaughan, 72, and his partner, Kim Worner, 66, from Deloraine, took off in a green two-seater Bristell S-LSA from George Town airport about 12.45pm on Saturday. They did not arrive at their destination in central NSW as scheduled, and family members raised the alarm on Saturday evening, police said. Police said there is no evidence to suggest the circumstances of the missing plane are suspicious. Anyone with information that could assist the search is urged to contact Tasmania police. Higginson: Folbigg compensation amount an ‘absolute slap in the face’ Sue Higginson, Greens MP and spokesperson for justice, has labelled the $2m ex gratia payment to Kathleen Folbigg, who spent 20 years in prison after being convicted of killing her children, before being pardoned in 2023, “an absolute slap in the face and a failure of the New South Wales premier to uphold the principles of fairness and justice in NSW”. She said a more appropriate compensation figure would have been 10 times the amount Folbigg has been offered by the state government. She said: Wrongful conviction is probably one of the most heinous things that the state can perpetrate on a person. The state of NSW did this to Kathleen Folbigg, a woman who had lost her own children. It’s hard to reconcile a greater crime against a woman, and that’s what happened here in this state. It got it wrong, and it was on Chris Minns and Michael Daly, as the NSW premier and the NSW attorney general, to right this wrong. And they have failed. Higginson said that ex gratia payments “are referred to as payments of grace in good faith. This offer is disgraceful and it’s been made in bad faith.” She said a more appropriate compensation figure would have been something in the order of $23m to $26m, based on the fact that Lindy Chamberlain received a payment of $1.3m for having served three years in prison. Higginson said it was within Minns’ power to correct the wrong and urged him to meet with Folbigg and address the issue. She also called for an inquiry into the ex gratia payment system, saying there was a lack of transparency about how decisions were reached on the dollar amount people received: We know that people can make an application for an ex gratia payment, and then things go into a kind of a Tardis, a closed door, a back room. It’s time to open this system. There needs to be more accountability, more realism, some more economic rationalism in this system, because what we’ve seen today is a perverse outcome. Kathleen Folbigg’s lawyer says her client’s ex-gratia compensation offer of $2m is “profoundly unfair and unjust”. Rhanee Rego said in a statement this afternoon that the “sum offered is a moral affront – woefully inadequate and ethically indefensible”. She said: The system has failed Kathleen Folbigg once again. Kathleen lost her four children; she lost 20 of the best years of her life; and she continues to feel the lasting effects of this ongoing trauma. The payment does not reflect the extent of the pain and suffering Kathleen has endured. This should be about the system recognising the significance of what it did to her. An inquiry is urgently needed to understand how the government decided on this figure. When Lindy Chamberlain was exonerated, she received $1.3m for three years in prison. Kathleen Folbigg spent two decades in prison, yet for her wrongful imprisonment she has been offered $2 million. Kathleen Folbigg’s fight should be over. After being failed at her conviction and abused in prison, she is now being treated with contempt by the very system that should be making amends. More on Kathleen Folbigg’s compensation. NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson, who was heavily involved in pressuring the government to release Folbigg after the independent inquiry, has revealed the New South Wales government compensated her just $2m. Higginson said the amount was “insulting”. In a statement, she said: $2m barely covers what Kathleen could have earned on a full-time salary over 20 years. Kathleen has not only lost 20 years of wages, she has lost her four children, her home and her employability. She has racked up legal costs fighting her wrongful conviction, she has lost her superannuation, and she has been the victim of one of the worst injustices in this state’s history – wrongful imprisonment. The finance department has rejected a last-minute bid from three senators who urged it not to lift a ban on PwC Australia competing for new work with the federal government. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed the finance department had recommended the end of a long-term ban triggered by a scandal involving the misuse of confidential Treasury information. Former PwC Australia partners no longer working at the firm remain under investigation by the Australian federal police. Finance’s report and recommendations were due to go public on 25 July until the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, requested the views of three senators who led parliamentary inquiries into the tax leaks scandal were taken into consideration. The three senators wrote to the department late last month urging it not to lift the ban, which was introduced in April 2024, while the tax leaks scandal was being investigated by federal police. Earlier today, the finance department wrote to Greens senator Barbara Pocock, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, and Labor senator Deborah O’Neill to inform them that while their views were respected, the ban would be lifted: Finance considers that it would not be appropriate to delay a decision on its assessment of the ethical soundness of PwC Australia. PwC Australia cannot bid for consultancy work until 2028 due to a non-compete clause with consultancy firm Scyne, which bought PwC’s government consultancy wing for just $1 at the height of the scandal. But the firm can bid for other work including audit services. Pocock said she was “deeply disappointed in the government for making this decision”: The government decision to let PwC back into the contracting consulting fold is an insult to the Senators and MPs who worked on two parliamentary inquiries examining what went wrong at PwC. We made a raft of recommendations which have yet to be enacted, while the government renews its contracting relationship with this disgraced entity. Chaney says proposal for GST review is about ‘tough conversations’ Kate Chaney says her proposal to review GST is about having “tough conversations” and not simply talking about tax cuts. The independent MP has just told ABC that as a “big part of our tax picture”, GST needs to be reviewed. “We’ve had no tax reform really in 20 years. And it’s a good tax. It’s efficient, it’s transparent, it’s simple,” she said. She said her plan meant “people who consume more, and who spend more, end up paying more tax” and ensured lower income earners were not penalised: We need leaders who are actually going to have the tough conversations, not only talk about tax cuts. At the moment, talking about any changes to the GST is just taboo. And we’re never going to have serious reform if we can’t even start the conversation. SA Greens urge premier to protect public servants’ right to work from home for South Australian Greens are urging the premier, Peter Malinauskas, to join them in legislating working from home protections for public sector workers. The Greens’ plan to introduce a private member’s bill would set guardrails to protect the right to work from home for one day a week for SA workers whose role can reasonably and practically be performed remotely, the Greens said in a statement. On Monday, Malinauskas told ABC Radio he did not support protecting work from home rights in law, despite the Victorian Labor government announcing plans to legislate a two-day WFH entitlement, they said. Robert Simms, SA Greens leader said: Workers are being stretched, and the Greens’ work from home bill will help them. This will mean more money in the pockets of workers and more time for your life, family and friends – while costing employers nothing. I urge the premier to embrace this opportunity to work with the Greens and avoid the perception that the Labor government is out of touch with modern workplaces. If the government fails to act, I have no doubt this will become a key issue for the next state election. Chalmers caught criticising News Corp in hot mic moment The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the Productivity Commission boss, Danielle Wood, have been recorded criticising the Australian newspaper during an event at Parliament House. The pair were preparing for a meeting of the treasurer’s investor roundtable on Wednesday when they were recorded discussing coverage of the upcoming productivity summit in the News Corp masthead. Neither appeared aware there were live microphones around them. Footage picked up by one of the news cameras given access to the start of the event showed Chalmers said the newspaper had “basically done a headline of the opposite of what I’d said”. Wood responded: “They’re getting so many things factually wrong.” Chalmers then said: “Deliberately so.” The government is continuing to roll out a series of pre-roundtable meetings ahead of the main talks in Canberra starting on 19 August. Chalmers, Wood and News Corp have been contacted for comment. Kathleen Folbigg has been compensated with an undisclosed sum after she spent two decades behind bars before having her convictions quashed. Folbigg was convicted in 2003 and ordered to serve a minimum 25-year sentence for the suffocation murders of three of her children and manslaughter of a fourth. She was granted an unconditional pardon and released from prison in June 2023 after an independent inquiry which heard new scientific evidence that indicated her children may have died from natural causes or a genetic mutation. In December 2023, the appeals court upheld the inquiry’s findings to formally overturn her convictions and clear her name. On Thursday, the attorney-general, Michael Daley, said in a statement: The Attorney General has decided to make an ex-gratia payment to Kathleen Folbigg following her application. The decision follows thorough and extensive consideration of the materials and issues raised in Ms Folbigg’s application and provided by her legal representatives. At Ms Folbigg’s request, the Attorney General and Government have agreed to not publicly discuss the details of the decision. Legal experts had told Guardian Australia in 2023 that Folbigg should receive the biggest compensation payout in Australian history because no other wrongful conviction had caused as much harm. Opposition attorney-general spokesperson says tech platforms cannot steal the work of Australian artists without paying Federal coalition frontbencher Julian Leeser has called for Australian artists to be financially protected from a potential loosening of AI regulation. It comes after the Productivity Commission used an interim report to warn against the overregulation of AI. The commission is examining whether technology firms should be exempt from copyright rules that stop companies mining text and data to train AI models. Leeser, the opposition’s attorney-general spokesperson, said Australian artists and creatives should not be sold out to AI: If tech companies profit from the work of Australian artists and creatives, they should pay fair compensation, just like any other person. In the real world, we wouldn’t let someone use an artist’s work for commercial purposes without paying for it. The virtual world should be no different. Thank you, Nick Visser. I’m Daisy Dumas and I’ll be with you for the remainder of this Thursday’s live news coverage. Let’s get going. That’s all for me, thanks for sticking with us today. The talented Daisy Dumas will be your shepherd through this afternoon’s news. Students converge on NSW Labor party offices in Sydney Students have converged on the New South Wales Labor party offices in Sydney’s Sussex Street after several hundred gathered at the Town Hall this afternoon to call for an end to suffering in Gaza. The students are chanting “Penny Wong you will see, Palestine will be free” and “Chris Minns you will see, Palestine will be free”. The deputy Greens leader and higher education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, was among those in attendance at the Town Hall. She told students on social media they had her “full permission” to skip class to attend the rally. Police in NSW said no arrests had been made as a result of the strike. Meanwhile, students in Melbourne have begun their walk-off at the city’s State Library after gathering at several university campuses, including the University of Melbourne. Update: there are, in fact, some under-40s on the economic roundtable this month We reported earlier that the Intergenerational Fairness Coalition was demanding at least two under-40s at Jim Chalmers’ reform roundtable later this month. Turns out their wishes have already been granted. Guardian Australia asked around and there are at least two participants in their 30s: Cassandra Winzar, the chief economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia; and Joseph Mitchell, an assistant secretary at the ACTU. Victorian losses on pokies jump to record high Victorians lost $3.14bn on poker machines in the 2024-25 financial year, a $115m jump from the previous reporting period and a record high. The Alliance for Gambling Reform said the spike in gambling losses on the pokies also came in a year when venues had changed operating hours that should have, in fact, led to a drop in losses. Uniform venue closing hours were in effect for all but two months of the last financial year. Martin Thomas, the CEO of the alliance, said: The new figures are appalling and represent devastating social harm across the state, not just financial loss, but in health and mental health conditions, marriage breakup, it exacerbates domestic violence and can lead to severe depression and suicide. This harm is actually becoming more acute as the figures show the number of people playing poker machines in Victoria has halved in the last 15 years. So there are fewer people who are being impacted. The alliance notes that in 2008, 21.5% of Victorians were gambling on poker machines. In 2023, that number dropped to just 10.7%. Dozens more countries face higher taxes on exports to US as new Trump tariffs come into effect Dozens of countries face higher taxes on their exports to the US now that Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs have come into force. The sweeping “reciprocal” levies announced by the White House a week ago – just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in place as of a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Just before midnight, Trump claimed on social media that billions of dollars would start flowing into the US as a result of the tariffs. He wrote: The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail.

The July meeting was the first face-to-face discussion between the pair since two Hong Kong activists wanted for alleged national security crimes were subjected to anonymous letters offering Australian neighbours $203,000 to inform on them. The letters are now being investigated by the countering foreign interference taskforce, which is led by Australia’s federal police and the domestic intelligence agency. Government sources confirmed Wong privately reiterated her public criticism of the targeting of Adelaide-based Ted Hui and Melbourne-based Kevin Yam. Her office previously described their treatment as “reprehensible” and a threat to “our national sovereignty”.

Rockliff spoke to the press after announcing his new cabinet in Launceston this afternoon, saying: I am expecting to go to parliament and for common sense to prevail. The people have spoken. … What the election said and the people of Tasmania clearly demonstrated is that they are sick and tired of the political games. Mr Winter continues to play political games … What I’m about is ensuring that I can learn from the previous parliament and engage with the crossbench for the benefit of Tasmanians. Rockliff was adamant that there will not be another election. Twelve judges resigned from Queensland writers award after intervention over Gaza tweets 12 judges resigned from the panels governing a Queensland writers award after First Nations writer Karen Wyld was stripped of a fellowship over tweets about the war in Gaza. State Library of Queensland chief, Vicki McDonald, revealed about a third of its 34 black&amp;write! writing fellowship judges had resigned after it was directed to withdraw the win by the minister in May. Arts minister John-Paul Langbroek said he “took action to uphold the integrity of publicly funded cultural institutions”. He said: I made it very clear that any perception that taxpayer funded awards are being granted to individuals who express views that justified terrorism undermines public confidence in our institutions and the broader cultural center sector. I will not rule out taking similar action in the future, if it is deemed necessary. If they choose not to be judges again, we will find other judges. Estimates also heard that the Queensland Performing Arts Centre board had recommended naming its new $184m theatre after an Indigenous Queenslander, particularly Indigenous poet and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal. Instead the state government put the decision to a public vote, with five options: Glasshouse theatre, Lantern theatre, Watershed theatre and Russell Street theatre, or suggest an alternative. It is to be called the Glasshouse theatre. Academic who had Palestinian flag removed from University of Sydney office applies to fly it again An academic who had a Palestinian flag removed from outside his office by the University of Sydney for breaching its new flag policy has applied for approval to fly the flag “for as long as Israel continues its genocide of the Palestinians”. Dr David Brophy, a senior lecturer in modern Chinese history, had been advised by the university its display breached the policy’s clause 2.8(1), which states that unapproved flags can be displayed in such areas on a temporary basis only. In a response to the university’s statement, Brophy said he had written to the vice-chancellor and the “Brand Team” for approval “to fly the same flag, from the same place, for as long as Israel continues its genocide of the Palestinians. I hope they’ll let me do it”. He said: It was always intended as a temporary gesture, until such time as Israel ends its genocide and withdraws from the Gaza Strip. Brophy said he was “glad” for one part of the university’s statement, which confirmed “we expect Palestinian flags to continue to feature on our campus”. “That’s something we can agree on,” Brophy said. Since Brophy’s flag was removed, three more Palestinian flags have appeared hanging from university buildings. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney said it would “assess any flags on campus in line with the flag policy”. This post has been updated to include the university’s response. Conviction for a ‘serious sex offence’ should be grounds for expulsion from parliament, Ron Hoenig’s lawyers argue Returning to the urgent hearing before the court of appeal right now after convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward sought an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament. The lawyer acting for the leader of the Legislative Assembly has disputed the Kiama MP’s assertion that his conviction alone is not “unworthy conduct”, and therefore parliament does not have grounds to undertake a vote on whether to expel him. Craig Lenehan, who is acting for Labor MP Ron Hoenig, argued: It’s obviously open to a legislative body to form a view that a member convicted by a jury of a serious sex offence should be expelled. He said the motion to expel Ward is not “some sort of illicit punitive purpose”, as argued by Ward’s lawyer, Peter King. Lenehan said: Nothing in the evidence suggests any such thing. Greens’ Nick McKim: ‘the best idea the teals can come up with is to make food more expensive?’ It’s not often that we see members of the crossbench take shots at each other, when they more often team up to push the government on various matters. McKim added: If we want to make people’s lives better we should make big corporations pay their fair share of tax and use the revenue to provide genuine cost of living relief. Since the pandemic the cost of essentials has skyrocketed, and the best idea the teals can come up with is to make food more expensive? McKim went on to claim “the teals want to hike up taxes on baby formula and electricity.” If we are serious about easing cost of living pressures we should be making big corporations and the super wealthy pay their fair share of tax. One in three of the biggest corporations pays no tax at all. The ultra-wealthy stash billions in trusts and tax shelters. Greens blast Kate Chaney’s GST idea as ‘lazy’ It’s a crossbench clash as the Greens accuse independent Kate Chaney of a “lazy idea” to raise the GST. Greens economic spokesperson Nick McKim shared a media statement titled “Teals’ GST plan shows warped priorities”. Referring to Chaney as a “teal” several times, in a rather critical takedown of her plan, McKim decried her idea, which he claimed would “jack up the GST and apply it to fresh food and utilities”. Instead the Greens are pushing their own plan to raise taxes on wealthy Australians and big businesses. McKim said: Kate Chaney’s plan to raise the GST to 15% and apply it to fresh food and utilities is a lazy idea. Students in Australia’s major cities are gathering to strike for Palestine and demand universities cut ties with weapons companies. The national class walkout kicked off at Sydney’s town hall at midday, with students walking from nearby universities carrying Palestinian flags and banners. Students are converging at Melbourne’s state library at 2pm, while Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Wollongong are also holding disruptions and sit-ins. The strike has been endorsed by the National Union of Students and the National Tertiary Education Union. On Thursday afternoon, students from the University of Sydney marched to the town hall carrying a banner reading: “There are no universities left in Gaza” and chanting “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”. Some universities have informed students they will not be penalised for attending the rallies, while others have urged participants to talk to their course conveners in advance. A bold proposal to give Australians an extra $3,300 per year in exchange for a rise in the goods and services tax is being treated with caution by the major parties, AAP reports. Independent MP Kate Chaney calls for the implementation of a “progressive GST model” as the federal government looks for ways to reinvigorate Australia’s languishing productivity and strengthen the budget at an economic roundtable. Under the plan, first proposed by economist Richard Holden, Australia would lift the rate of the consumption tax from 10 to 15% and apply it to exempt items such as food, education and health. But to mitigate the impact on those with lower incomes, all Australians aged 18 and older would be given a $3,300 rebate, meaning they would effectively pay no GST on the first $22,000 of their annual expenses. Cheney said: The major parties like to talk about tax cuts and spending but they’re less willing to discuss where the money will come from. We have to have courageous conversations about other revenue sources to avoid handballing this problem to future generations. Under-40s and the economic roundtable In hyping his talkfest back in June, Chalmers said “the decisions we make in the 2020s will determine the sort of living standards and intergenerational justice that we have in the decades to come”. And younger Australians have plenty to worry about. Unaffordable homes, soaring student debt programs, the burden of higher taxes to pay for an ageing population and fears that AI will crush their careers – all threaten to leave the current generation with lower living standards than their parents. Then there’s the more existential threat from climate change. But, as Jane Body from the Intergenerational Fairness Coalition notes, the reform roundtable agenda also doesn’t find space for a specific session on intergenerational issues. • This post was updated on 7 August 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated that there were no participants in the roundtable under 40 and said Jane Body called for at least two under-40 representatives to be added to the list of conference attendees. Please see our update here. Qantas has devalued its frequent flyer points. What should you do now? Qantas was back in the spotlight this week with news that affected members of its frequent flyer program. The airline has made significant changes to its loyalty program, effectively devaluing its frequent flyer points. Qantas has announced changes to its loyalty program. But will they benefit frequent flyers – and are members better off spending their points on shopping instead of flights? My colleague, Catie McLeod, explains: The vacancy rate for Australian office buildings is at the highest level in three decades, according to new figures from the Australian Property Council. The body released new data today finding office vacancies had risen from 14.7% to 15.2% nationally. Mike Zorbas, the chief of the council, said many tenants were increasingly opting for premium offices that have been hitting the market in greater numbers. Those upper-tier choices have seen a year and a half of positive growth, while lower-grade choices had seen falling occupancy rates. The council notes that offices are graded on levels of quality, with premium and A grade the highest and B, C and D grades considered of “secondary” quality. Zorbas said in a statement: Tenants are capitalising on opportunities to occupy premium buildings in prime CBD locations, with premium space continuing to see higher demand levels than lower-grade buildings. Much of this demand is centred on Premium and A Grade buildings, with B, C and D grade office buildings experiencing negative demand over the last six months. Gareth Ward’s lawyer has argued the MP for Kiama’s convictions cannot alone be considered the “unworthy conduct” needed as grounds to expel him from parliament. Ward was found guilty in July of sexually abusing two young men in 2013 and 2015. He is appealing his convictions, which include three counts of indecent assault and one for sexual intercourse without consent. Ward’s barrister, Peter King, said: It’s not, in our respectful submission, justice according to law to say to someone, ‘well you’ve been convicted, we’re now going to punish you by expelling you from the parliament’. We submit that the [common law] privilege doesn’t work that way. King said the four convictions cannot alone be the basis for the expulsion given the judicial process is yet to conclude, and that the government has identified no other “unworthy conduct” in its reasons to expel him. If he’s acquitted, and he’s lost all the rights that an innocent man would otherwise have, his career has been trashed. Chief justice Andrew Bell – one of the three judges overseeing the matter – interjected to say the criminal convictions were serious. Bell said: “He’s had, as you say, a nine-week trial, and he’s been convicted by 12 of his fellow citizens.” King later compared Ward’s absence from parliament to someone who has a “serious malady or illness or cancer or something” and cannot attend parliament for nine months. Continuing from previous post: Documents provided by US authorities suggest Zavvar could be sent to Australia or Romania, despite Zavvar having no links to either place. He has never lived in either country. Guardian Australia approached the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, and the foreign minister, Penny Wong, for an explanation about the case, but Labor says it has not been approached by the United States in relation to it. A government spokesperson said there was no new agreement for transfer of US immigration detainees to Australia. They said: We consider any application for a visa on its merits, we have not been contacted by the US government about this matter. There have been no new agreements made with the Trump Administration on immigration. Trump administration threatens to deport Iranian man to Australia Labor has cast doubt on the possibility of the Trump administration transferring an Iranian-born man from US immigration detention to Australia, saying it has no knowledge of the case. The US government is threatening to deport Reza Zavvar, a 52-year-old recruiter from Maryland, to either Australia or Romania. Zavvar is being held in detention, despite holding a US immigration green card, due to a historical conviction for marijuana possession which dates back to the 1990s. Zavvar cannot be sent back to Iran due to risk of persecution there, and his lawyer Ava Benach says he has been told he could be sent to a third country. The Trump administration has taken a hard line on deporting non-citizens from the US, often to countries in South America. The deportation policy has seen people arrested without warning by federal officials around the US, and has sparked a series of legal challenges. Albanese was asked about his position on work-from-home after Victoria premier Jacinta Allan outlined plans to legislate flexible working rights. The prime minister said during a press conference today: We think that working from home and flexible working arrangements can benefit both workers and employers. And during the election campaign … the Coalition promised, of course, to send people back to the office five days a week. That ended up with some of them not having an office any more. I think that flexible working arrangements benefit both workers and employers. When asked if he would support a legislated right to work from home on a federal level, Albanese said Labor had already amended the Fair Work Act in 2022 with the Secure Jobs, Better Pay amendment. Jacinta Allan is Victorian premier. She’s putting forward her views. I’ve got to say it’s consistent with our views, which are that working from home is something that’s important, something that Australians voted for, something that Peter Dutton tried to clamp down on, and Australians responded accordingly. Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward is facing an urgent court hearing this morning after he sought an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him from the New South Wales parliament. Ward’s barrister, Peter King, is providing his arguments now before the three judge bench in the court of appeal. King argued the NSW Legislative Assembly was seeking to expel Ward via a “kangaroo court” because Ward’s “existing right as a member of the assembly to speak in the debate to oppose the resolution is lost”. Ward, the independent MP for Kiama, is in Silverwater jail, where he has been remanded pending sentencing in September. King told the court this was one of a number of reasons why he would argue the government’s resolution to expel Ward was “punitive in nature”. Another reason he argued it was punitive was because Ward’s expulsion would trigger a byelection and “he’s further punished in that respect, by losing the opportunity to regain his seat”. A judge interjected to say Ward’s inability to attend parliament and oppose the resolution was “driven entirely” by the fact he applied for bail but was refused. King responded the difficulty was the resolution being “brought on hurriedly” and in “circumstances in which it means that his existing right as a member of the assembly to speak in the debate to oppose the resolution is lost.” The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the health minister, Mark Butler, are in Melbourne to speak about the government’s efforts to open 50 Medicare urgent care clinics. The prime minister told media of three new clinics in Victoria: When you need healthcare, you can get it and you can get it for free. That is why this is so important going forward. My government is really proud that we’re doing this. We want to see, if possible, our objective of the 50 urgent care clinics, additional [ones] opened as soon as possible. Certainly within a year, but we’ll see how we go about how many we can get open in 2025. My government is determined that this will be a year of delivery – delivery on the commitments which Australians voted for. The three existing clinics in Warrnambool, Sunshine and Warragul were state-funded urgent care services, but have been brought in to the federal urgent care clinic network. Nine new clinics will be established in Victoria between 2025 and 2026. Butler said the new urgent care clinics were already taking pressure off hospital emergency departments, saying eventually four in five Australians will live within a 20-minute drive to an urgent care clinic. Butler said: It’s taking pressure off the hospital system, it’s providing people with that option for care seven days a week, extended hours, and fully bulk-billed. And it’s a central part of our strengthening Medicare agenda. Search for missing plane enters sixth day along Tasmania’s coast Tasmania Police are continuing the search for a small plane that went missing on Saturday after leaving the state’s George Town airport. Two people – identified as Gregory Vaughan, 72, and his partner, Kim Worner, 66 – were on board, along with their dog, travelling to regional NSW. A police helicopter will search the coastline along northern Tasmania today after early searches found no sign of the light sport plane. No boats have been able to join the hunt since Tuesday due to challenging weather conditions and no new search areas have been identified. The matter is now part of an active investigation, officials said. Police said previously there has been no contact with the couple, or their plane, since it left the George Town airport near Tasmania’s north coast. Parts of central NSW still under evacuation orders as flood waters move downstream Some residents in the towns of Gunnedah and Narrabri remain under flood evacuation orders after last weekend’s heavy rain. The NSW SES notes 20 emergency warnings are active in parts of NSW, including 16 “evacuate now” alerts. About 2,200 volunteers have responded to more than 2,600 incidents since the latest weather event began, with 40 flood rescues so far. Officials said on social media those threats remain for those along the Namoi River at Wee Waa: The Namoi River at Wee Waa is continuing to rise and the flood risk in the town is increasing today and NSW SES has prepositioned crews and assets in the affected areas in preparation. SES officials urge residents in potentially impacted areas to stay up-to-date with the HazardWatch app. Some electric cars fall short of claimed range by up to 23% A government-funded program to test the true performance of vehicles has found the driving range of five popular electric cars is between 5% and 23% lower than results from laboratory testing. The Australian Automobile Association tested vehicles from Tesla, BYD, Kia and Smart – the first EVs to be put through its four-year, federally funded Real World Testing Program to give consumers more accurate information on vehicle performance. The extended range variant of the BYD Atto3 had the largest discrepancy, according to the AAA, with a real-world range of 369km, 23% lower than the 480km achieved in laboratory testing. The Smart #3 had the lowest, with only a 5% difference. The Tesla Model 3 had a real-world range 14% lower than the lab test. Tesla’s Model Y and the Kia EV6 both had a real world range 8% lower. Read more here: National Union of Students calls for student referendum on Palestine The National Union of Students is endorsing a national student referendum on Palestine, and will poll students on whether to pass motions censuring the Australian government and their universities amid the ongoing war in Gaza. The union said mass meetings of students will take place at campuses across the country from 20 to 28 August, where those gathered will debate two motions. One includes students censuring the Australian government for its “complicity in the genocide in Gaza”, including a demand to end all weapons sales to Israel. The other calls on Australian universities to end their partnerships with weapons companies. James McVicar, the education officer for the union, said in a statement: In the face of our own government’s complicity in the crime of genocide, students are standing up and demanding to be counted. The National Student Referendum on Palestine will be a chance for students across the country to vote no confidence in our government and demand an end to weapons companies on our campuses. Hundreds more jobs could be axed at Australia’s national science agency, sparking concerns the country is gutting its research capability just as the Trump administration makes deep cuts into the sector in the US. The latest potential research job losses at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) follow 440 positions being cut last financial year and earlier deep reductions under the Coalition government, including 300 in 2016. They coincide with the Trump administration slashing science agencies in the US, with warnings the loss of expertise could have global ramifications in health, climate science and weather forecasting. Read more: Peak welfare body calls for property tax breaks to be rolled back before productivity roundtable The Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) says the government should roll back tax breaks for property investors, the latest major body to do so ahead of the treasurer’s productivity roundtable later this month. Acoss, the nation’s peak welfare body, says the capital gains tax should be halved and negative gearing should be limited. There should also be a commonwealth royalty payment for offshore gas, the group says, adding revenue generated by those changes should be invested in social housing. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of Acoss, told the ABC: We are very clear we would phase out the very generous 50% tax discount and get it down to 25%. So there’d be some tax reward for property investment, but nowhere near as generous. On Sunday, the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, also called for changes to the capital gains tax and negative gearing. She said at the time bold reforms were needed to help younger people, saying it was time for the country to “bite the bullet” on the ABC. The NSW parliament will introduce legislation to strengthen laws surrounding the creation and distribution of intimate and sexually explicit deepfake images, as well as criminalise the creation and distribution of sexually explicit audio. If passed, the expanded law would encompass sexually explicit content created entirely using artificial intelligence. It is already a crime in NSW to record or distribute intimate images of a person without their consent, including those that have been digitally altered. The amendments will see the production of a sexually explicit deepfake meant to depict a real, identifiable person become an offence subject to a punishment of three years in jail. Anyone convicted of sharing or threatening to share deepfake images, even if the person hasn’t created them, will also be punishable by up to three years in jail. NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, said the changes would close a gap in the law that leaves women vulnerable to “AI-generated sexual exploitation”. He added to media: These images can look very, very real. They can also be very, very harmful. And their prevalence is well on the increase. Almost all of the images circulating online are pornographic in nature. 99% of them are images of girls and women. One signatory says Gaza letter represents ‘strong, shared frustration’ at furrowed brows over action Peter Rodgers, a former ambassador to Israel, said the letter represents a call to action after a long period of “worried looks”. He told RN Breakfast this morning: I think there’s a strong, shared frustration, and indeed anger, at all the furrowed brows and the expressions of deep concern, growing concern, etc. etc, and very little action. And so I think that’s what this letter represents. It is time for action, not just worried looks. Rodgers said arguments the recognition of a Palestinian state would embolden Hamas were “nonsensical”, saying not doing so actually rewarded Israel’s campaign: It rewards the government of Benjamin Netanyahu for its campaign of genocidal violence in Gaza, for its campaign of ethnic cleansing and apartheid in the West Bank. And so it’s a nonsensical argument. The problem here is, certainly on the Palestinian side, there are some very nasty people. On the Israeli side, there are also nasty people … I think we need to be very careful of pointing the finger in one direction and forgetting what’s going on the other side. A group of former Australian ambassadors and diplomats have urged prime minister Anthony Albanese to do more to see the end of Israel’s war in Gaza, including the recognition of a Palestinian state. The coalition includes former ambassador to Israel, Peter Rodgers, former diplomat, Alison Broinowski, Australia’s first ambassador to China, Stephen FitzGerald and former ambassador to Japan, John Menadue. The letter says the recognition of a Palestinian state is deeply important as repeated calls for a two-state solution make “no sense when only one state exists, and that heavily-armed state, Israel, is engaged in apartheid, war crimes, and potential genocide of almost totally defenceless people”. The letter, sent Monday, reads in part: We are distressed that Australia has done so little to prevent the progressive erosion of international law, the persistent armed assaults on Palestinian people, and the violation of their human rights in Gaza and the West Bank. We acknowledge your statements, together with other leaders, about the need for cautious consideration of recognition of a Palestinian state, and about the need for a two-state solution. Your approach is supported by a growing number of Australians, of Jewish, Palestinian, and other backgrounds. This process, while welcome, is far too slow. It is taking more time than the famine-affected people of Gaza and the displaced Palestinians of the West Bank have, if they are to survive. Time is of the essence for them. You can read the full text of the open letter here. Treasurer says Australia can be ‘big player’ in future of data centres Chalmers was also asked about the former CEO of Atlassian, who recently said he wants to see Australia host massive data centres and see a change in the copyright law to allow exemptions for data mining for AI companies. Chalmers said the data centres were “a major opportunity” for Australia, adding: As it turns out, I’ve spent a few hours this afternoon with $3tn of Australian capital, the biggest investors in Australia, super and other institutional investors, we’ve been grappling with this question: how does Australia make the most of this opportunity when it comes to data centres and AI infrastructure more broadly? We have got a big chance, we’ll be mad not to grab it. We need to get the energy piece right, the zoning approvals piece right, the skills piece right as well. We can be a big player in data centres. Chalmers says he will err on the side of workers when it comes to AI The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, appeared on 7.30 last night, where he was talking about how AI will be a key topic at the government’s productivity roundtable in a few weeks. He was asked if he would support the Australian Council of Trade Unions’ call for workers to be able to veto AI in their workplace. He said he would err on the side of workers: We need to be realistic about it. And certainly, I agree that workers need to be part of the conversation when it comes to rolling out a technology that has this game-changing potential.
