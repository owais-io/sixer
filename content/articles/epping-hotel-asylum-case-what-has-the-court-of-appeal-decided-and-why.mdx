  A temporary injunction that would have blocked asylum seekers from being
  housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, has been overturned by the court of
  appeal. Here we explain what the court decided, and its significance. What was
  the appeal about? Last week, after an application by Epping Forest district
  council (EFDC), a high court judge ruled that asylum seekers could no longer
  be placed at the protest-hit Bell hotel and gave its owner, Somani Hotels,
  until 12 September to rehouse the 138 remaining there. Mr Justice Eyre granted
  the injunction, to remain in force until the case could be heard in full in
  October, after hearing EFDC’s complaints that planning law had been breached
  in changing the site’s use. Somani Hotels challenged the decision at the court
  of appeal, as did the Home Office, which had been refused permission by Eyre
  to intervene in the high court case. What did the court of appeal decide and
  why? The three justices said both Somani Hotels and the Home Office, which it
  permitted to intervene in the case, could appeal against Eyre’s decision and
  quashed the temporary injunction in the meantime. Lord Justice Bean, sitting
  with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said Eyre had made a
  number of errors in principle. He said: “The judge’s approach ignores the
  obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be
  identified elsewhere in the system.” Other reasons given for overturning the
  interim relief were that Eyre should not have given weight in his judgment to
  protests, including unlawful protests, taking place outside the hotel, as that
  could incentivise further protests and “further lawlessness”. The judges said
  this risk outweighed Epping residents’ fear of crime. They also cited the fact
  that the Bell hotel had been used to house asylum seekers since 2020 without
  EFDC taking any enforcement action. What is the significance of the decision?
  If the court of appeal had upheld the temporary injunction, it would not only
  have affected the situation in Epping but other councils had indicated they
  would consider their own legal challenges to prevent hotels in their area
  being used to house asylum seekers. Eyre had made plain that his decision was
  specific to the “narrow dispute” being discussed. But the court of appeal
  judgment said the interim relief “may incentivise local planning authorities
  who wish to remove asylum accommodation from their area to apply to the court
  urgently before capacity elsewhere in the system becomes exhausted. The
  potential cumulative impact of such ad hoc applications was a material
  consideration … that was not considered by the judge.” What does it mean for
  the policy of housing asylum seekers in hotels? Although the temporary
  injunction was set aside, EFDC’s challenge to the Bell hotel being used to
  house asylum seekers will still proceed to a trial, scheduled for October.
  Should EFDC be successful, the high court could then decide that asylum
  seekers should be removed from the Bell hotel. The court of appeal judges were
  clear in stating that the case “is not concerned with the merits of government
  policy in relation to the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers in
  hotels or otherwise”. What has the political reaction been? The appeal court
  ruling has recharged tensions over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.
  The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the judgment was a “setback but
  not the end” and urged councils to “keep going” with legal actions against
  asylum accommodation. Along with other senior Tories, Badenoch accused Labour
  of prioritising the rights of “illegal immigrants” over local residents, and
  she claimed her party had a plan to “end the asylum hotel scourge once and for
  all”, despite the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels having risen
  dramatically under the last Conservative government. The Reform UK leader,
  Nigel Farage, went further, saying: “The government has used the ECHR
  [European convention on human rights] against the people of Epping. Illegal
  migrants have more rights than British people under Starmer.” The ruling is
  likely to fuel his attacks on Labour and the Tories. In contrast, the Labour
  government has kept its response measured while defending its record, saying
  the ruling would help avoid a return to the “chaos of recent years”. Angela
  Eagle, a Home Office minister, said: “This government will close all hotels by
  the end of this parliament … we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell
  can be exited in a controlled and orderly way.” Could this set a precedent for
  future legal challenges? The court of appeal stressed that the decision was
  limited to interim relief, but the case could influence how future cases are
  approached. Local Conservative authorities considering their own legal actions
  may face a higher bar when seeking emergency injunctions to stop hotels being
  used for asylum accommodation. Councils may not be able to rely on public
  protest or local opposition to try to sway the courts, especially where the
  accommodation has been in place for some time.
