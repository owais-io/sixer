  Welcome to the celluloid jungle. Guitar legend and Guns N’ Roses axeman Slash
  is getting into movies, producing a “requel” of the 1983 cult Roger Corman
  trash classic Deathstalker. The film has its world premiere at the Locarno
  film festival in Switzerland, where Slash – aka Saul Hudson – is talking up
  this new addition to his CV. It turns out that Slash’s affection for
  Deathstalker goes way back. “When I was working at Tower Video, we had it on
  the monitors all the time. It was a real popular popcorn movie,” he says.
  “I’ve been producing movies for a little while now. I work with these Canadian
  producers and I did another film [The Breach] with them back in 2020. They
  managed to get the IP for Deathstalker, and they asked me about it, and I was
  like, ‘Oh, my God, yes.’ I thought the script was great and Steve Kostanski, a
  director I love, was into doing it.” Kostanski previously co-directed the
  wonderfully Lovecraftian The Void and the utterly bonkers Psycho Goreman,
  which with its kooky comedy and OTT splatter is similar in tone to the
  nostalgic delights and gunky gore of Deathstalker. “It’s all practical
  effects. I’m not a big CGI guy,” says Slash. “Steve was totally into doing it
  that way. He had no interest in making it a CGI movie, so we hit it off right
  away. I knew that Steve could make it better than the budget.” Other fantasy
  films from the period proved an inspiration. “I loved Krull and the original
  Conan the Barbarian,” says Slash. “And I loved Deathstalker. It was sort of
  tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated and low budget, and it had this great theme song.
  My whole interest in getting to do this new one – which isn’t a remake, it’s
  sort of another version of it – was really nostalgic for me. Once we got the
  script, I thought ‘Man, we could really make a great movie.’ And Daniel
  Bernhardt coming in and being the lead was awesome because he played the part
  so perfectly. It was really a passion project.” Veteran stunt performer
  Bernhardt, who has more than a passing resemblance to Hugh Jackman, plays the
  not-too-bright hero Deathstalker with a straight face. In the original movie,
  Deathstalker goes on a quest to collect magical objects and defeat evil wizard
  Munkar. “It’s got a great sense of humour to it, but it’s still effective as
  an action movie with a sort of fantasy element to it,” says Slash. “It ticks a
  lot of boxes.” Slash was born in the UK and spent his early childhood in
  Stoke-on-Trent before moving to the US at six years old. “I really grew up
  steeped in British Hammer movies. James Bond – seriously,” he says. “I loved
  horror from as early on as I can remember. That kind of film music was my
  first real introduction into scoring. And I don’t know if that had any
  influence on my tastes or not.” No doubt it did: Guns N’ Roses covered Paul
  McCartney and Wings’s Live and Let Die on their 1991 album Use Your Illusion
  I. “As far as visuals and storytelling, those were the first movies. And then
  there were the Edgar Allan Poe films of Roger Corman and more literary stuff
  that my dad turned me on to.” Slash’s handlers say strictly no questions about
  music, so I ask him about how the movies influenced his work. “There’s a lot
  of different angles to how I got into music and movies and the combination
  thereof,” he says. “When I was a kid, I always loved movie theme songs and
  scores, and that’s always been a huge influence on me. I don’t know if it had
  any influence on me picking up the guitar, I was more of a straight ahead
  rock’n’roll guy. But when I started getting into the idea of producing movies,
  one of the things that I was really into was the fact that I’d have some say
  on the music for whatever movie I was working on.” Slash’s first producer
  credit was on the 2013 Anne Heche horror movie Nothing Left to Fear; more
  recently he was involved in producing Scandi-thriller-adapted TV series The
  Crow Girl, and contributed score music for Nothing Left to Fear and the
  aforementioned The Breach. “Prior to producing, I’d done a lot of recordings
  for different movies. So when I pick a movie to produce, the first thing I
  think about is what the music is going to be like, and whether there’s going
  to be a theme song; what the vibe is going to be. It speaks to me in a
  different way than when I just think about writing a rock’n’roll song. I use a
  completely different part of my musical brain. It’s very satisfying.” •
  Deathstalker is due for release in the US in October.
