  It was the early 80s, and Sylvester Stallone was on a roll. After years of
  making ends meet with bit parts, background artist work and pornography, he
  wrote and starred in Rocky in 1976, breaking into mainstream success. Before
  long he had carved out a new niche, writing, directing, and acting himself
  into stardom with a string of tough-guy movies including two hugely successful
  Rocky sequels. Then came Rambo. The character is peak 80s Stallone, a byword
  for pure testosterone. An absurd, improbably muscular slab of ham with a
  headband and an M60 machine gun, spraying bullets at racial caricatures in a
  jungle or a desert somewhere. Which is a shame, because the original film is
  truly great. First Blood – the 1982 flick that launched a five-part franchise
  spanning almost four decades – is one of those films that isn’t what people
  think it is. It’s easy to conflate it with the torrent of other Stallone guff
  from the 80s – namely the film’s myriad sequels. Based on a novel by David
  Morrell and directed by Ted Kotcheff – who also made the brutal Australian
  classic Wake in Fright – First Blood is a film about PTSD, machismo, and the
  long aftermath of the Vietnam war. John Rambo is a drifter, a Vietnam vet
  without a purpose. His last war buddy has died from Agent Orange exposure, and
  he is unable to shut out the horrors. After being brutalised by police, he
  escapes custody and retreats to the woods, where his severe PTSD sends him
  into defensive bouts of violence as he maims everyone who comes after him. The
  70s were full of so-called “vetsploitation” films. Everything from high-end
  Oscar fodder like Taxi Driver to the notorious Blackenstein – yes, Black
  Frankenstein – mined the trauma of returned Vietnam servicemen. Stallone
  emphasises Rambo’s transition from kind and gentle in the film’s opening
  scenes to distressed and vacant, a hunted animal. His former commanding
  officer Trautman (Richard Crenna) is called in to talk Rambo down like he’s a
  tricky piece of equipment that needs defusing. As with other action films from
  the era, First Blood is tragic and bloodthirsty, basking in masculine excess
  at the same time as condemning it. First Blood has almost no women in it; an
  actress who plays a pivotal role at the beginning of the film is uncredited,
  and bizarrely remains unidentified. This is men without women, and it’s ugly,
  destructive and tragic. A review of Morrell’s original First Blood novel
  described it as “carnography”. Like Wake in Fright, First Blood presents
  masculinity as a trap: a battle with no winners. Stallone excels at playing a
  tragic hero. Both Rocky and Rambo are simple men with a talent for brutality,
  and a determination to go the distance. Both are plainly damaged by a world
  that only values them for their muscle. Neither knows when to stop. So of
  course there were sequels. But how do you make a sequel to such a complete,
  rounded story? Does Rambo join the anti-war movement? Lead a prison riot?
  Finally get that valet job? They went a different way. In the ensuing films,
  Rambo ventures on a series of top-secret missions in Vietnam, Afghanistan,
  Burma. As the American male grew bored of all that tiresome introspection,
  Rambo became a caricature, a walking action figure stuck in a string of
  delusional fantasies. And what’s the most logical next step for the story of a
  traumatised war vet who maims police officers? That’s right: a children’s
  animated series and accompanying toy range. Even Stallone was embarrassed
  about Rambo: The Force of Freedom – the 1986 animated series in which our hero
  and his team take on the Specialist-Administrators of Vengeance, Anarchy and
  Global Extortion (that’s Savage for short). But I’ve figured the sequels out.
  They’re dream sequences. After a brief moment of self-awareness at the end of
  First Blood, Rambo descends into a deep, decades-long psychosis. For John
  Rambo, the war is never over. First Blood is available to stream on Prime
  Video, Stan and Binge in Australia and available to rent in the UK and US. For
