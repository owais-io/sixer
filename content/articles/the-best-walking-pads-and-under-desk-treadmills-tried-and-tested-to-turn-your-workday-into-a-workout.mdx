  Various guidelines suggest we all try to walk at least 10,000 steps a day to
  improve our health and wellbeing. Public Health England encourages a slightly
  more manageable target of just 10 minutes of brisk walking daily to introduce
  more moderate-intensity physical activity and reduce your risk of early death
  by up to 15%. However, even squeezing in “brisk walks” can be a chore, with
  busy schedules and increasingly desk-bound jobs forcing more of us to remain
  sedentary for long periods. That is where walking pads come in, being lighter,
  smaller and often easier to store than bulky and tricky-to-manoeuvre running
  treadmills. When coupled with a standing desk, walking pads can be used while
  working – or when watching TV in the evening. Just a couple of 30-minute
  sessions add thousands of steps to your daily tally. In fact, a 60-minute walk
  at an easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories,
  helping those who want to improve their fitness and tone up without the
  sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session. Walking pads are
  often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to
  store, and they’re perfect for adding more movement to your life without
  having to give up the day job. *** At a glance Best walking pad overall: JTX

  Mobvoi *** Why you should trust me I’m a keen fitness fan who does everything
  from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs
  and cold-water surfing. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing
  fitness technology for industry magazines. I’ve always been one to get stuck
  in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch
  or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells. I’m a strong
  believer that you need to live with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it
  fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as
  possible and in the right environment. With walking pads, that meant strolling
  along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this
  feature. How I tested There was only one way to properly trial the five
  walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer
  journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then
  shoehorning them into daily life. The best walking treadmills – or walking
  pads – aren’t quite as bulky as regular running treadmills, so I could have
  multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of
  the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to
  ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each. The testing
  process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a
  whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was
  attempting to enjoy. Besides general observations on the heft, ease of
  storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any
  additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any
  remote controls or apps. To get a good idea of energy consumption and the
  overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power
  meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy use, and calculated the cost
  based on my energy tariff. Here are the five best walking treadmills you can
  buy now. *** The best under-desk treadmills and walking pads in 2025 *** Best
  overall walking pad: JTX MoveLight £449 at JTX Fitness £499 at Amazon JTX
  tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness
  equipment. The brand is known for offering affordability and reliable build
  quality, but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes. The MoveLight
  walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive
  walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it’s also one of the heaviest. That’s
  no bad thing, though: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when
  compared with the much cheaper Rattantree, for example. The JTX also offers a
  super-sized display, cushioned walking deck and quiet 1hp electric motor. It’s
  a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s possible to use
  it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart. Why we love it The
  JTX is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic
  chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s
  also a generous running deck area. The extra-large LED console is easy to use
  and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk.
  The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become
  tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you. A small
  plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and
  scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half, and speed
  and step count on the other. The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the
  deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others
  tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring
  that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable. Overall, it feels like a
  walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price. But
  that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the
  overall weight requiring some serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It
  also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine. Oh, and one final
  public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care
  that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.
  During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals,
  supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or
  about 90p a month if used for an hour each day. It’s a shame that … it’s so
  big and heavy to move around, which makes storing it after each session a
  chore. Size: 147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH) Weight: 29.5kg Walking deck size: 45 x
  122cm Maximum user weight: 100kg Average running cost: 3p/hour Incline: none
  Maximum speed: 6km/h Folding: no *** Best budget walking pad: Rattantree
  shock-absorbing treadmill £142.49 at Debenhams £151.99 at BoohooMan It was a
  bit of a surprise when this Rattantree treadmill arrived sporting
  HomeFitnessCode branding. It’s a mega-value, fairly generic option that hails
  from China, and it’s no surprise that it doesn’t offer all the bells and
  whistles of its pricier rivals. The build quality isn’t fantastic, but it is
  very lightweight, an absolute doddle to use and covers the basics required by
  most working walkers. It’s marketed for walking and running, with the belt
  managing speeds of up to 10km/h, but this feels extremely fast for such a
  barebones machine. Why we love it Let’s get straight to the point: this is a
  budget option. It’s much cheaper than most of the others tested and doesn’t
  come with any fancy features such as Bluetooth, incline or built-in speakers.
  It’s a simple 39 x 104cm revolving running deck, paired with a powerful (but
  noisy) 2.5hp electric motor that’s able to crank the belt up to 10km/h. Speed
  adjustment is taken care of by a small remote, which needs two AAA batteries
  to operate. Upon unboxing, the cost savings are immediately obvious. It is not
  only light but also basic in its build. A simple steel frame, a motor and a
  belt are about all you get. A small and often tricky-to-read LED console at
  the top scrolls through distance travelled, time elapsed and a rough guide to
  how many calories you’ve burned, but there’s no way of jumping to the data
  field you want. You just have to wait for it to come around again. The lighter
  overall weight makes it much easier to move around the house than others, but
  I found it also started to move around underfoot, creak and generally complain
  a little as the speeds went beyond 8km/h. Put it this way: I don’t think this
  lightweight walking pad would last an indoor marathon at a training pace. As a
  simple walking pad to tuck under a desk, though, it’s absolutely fine. The
  belt needed adjusting after about a week of use, but slurping just 70W of
  power at 3.5km/h means it costs pennies to use daily. It’s a shame that … it
  cranks up to speeds of 10km/h because it doesn’t feel sturdy enough for those
  speeds. Size: 122 x 49 x 14cm (LWH) Weight: 19kg Maximum user weight: 109kg
  Average running cost: 2p/hour Walking deck size: 39 x 104cm Incline: none
  Maximum speed: 10km/h Folding: no Prefer to sit while you work? We’ve also
  reviewed the best office chairs *** Best walking pad for beginners: Urevo
  Strol 2E £169.98 at Amazon It’s difficult to separate the Strol 2E from the
  Mobvoi below, with both opting for a slimline, folding handle design that
  allows them to transform from simple under-desk walking pads to more
  traditional running treadmills. Built of sturdier stuff than its doppelganger,
  the Strol also brings an impressive digital offering into the mix with the
  Urevo smartphone and tablet app. This provides free virtual walks and collates
  daily, weekly and monthly workout information. With an impressively quiet and
  powerful 2.25hp electric motor and plenty of shock absorption underfoot, it’s
  a great way to rack up additional steps during the day, whether from speedier
  walking sessions or even light jogs. Why we love it Aside from representing
  excellent value for money, the Strol 2E is smaller, easier to store and less
  of a task to move around the house than some of its counterparts. Its slim
  profile means it will slip under a sofa or bed when not in use. The downside
  of this is a small walking deck, which is particularly lacking in length. This
  makes it easy to run out of room if you have longer legs, and makes faster
  running sessions particularly awkward for anyone taller than 5ft. Urevo opts
  for a folding handle that flips up in running mode. This includes a magnetic
  safety catch that clips to your clothes and automatically shuts off the unit
  if you inadvertently run out of deck space. Aside from the quiet operation,
  well-cushioned walking surface and low power consumption, the Strol 2E is also
  one of the most technologically accomplished walking pads on this list. The
  free-to-download app offers virtual walks and allows you to set workouts based
  on time, step and calorie goals. You can control the speed of the treadmill
  from your phone or tablet, or use a slick remote control that can also turn
  off the annoying beeps at the press of a button. It comes with a plastic
  device holder that can be clipped on to the safety handle for bingeing Netflix
  or enjoying one of those scenic virtual tours – although you’ll need
  headphones because there’s no built-in speaker. For the price, it’s an
  accomplished package and excellent value for money. It’s a shame that … the
  belt is so short, making it awkward to run on. Taller users will probably find
  the walking deck too small for longer strides, too. Size: 122 x 57 x 99cm
  (LWH) Weight: 21.4kg Walking deck size: 38 x 102cm Maximum user weight: 120kg
  Average running cost: 3p/hour Incline: none Maximum speed: 10km/h Folding: yes
  – safety handle for running *** Best foldable walking pad: BodyMax WP60 £549
  at Amazon The most expensive model on test, the BodyMax walking pad also
  happens to be one of the best built and easiest on the eye. It’s the only
  model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a
  cupboard or wardrobe. However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the
  easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its
  end and rolled around. Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers
  a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel
  that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and
  average calorie burn. Very much the Porsche of the walking pad world, the
  BodyMax unit combines stylish looks and powerful performance – but it does
  require deep pockets. Why we love it Like most walking pads tested here, it
  comes with a small remote control to adjust the speed, but there’s also a
  clever automatic mode – or A Mode – that senses the foot placement and
  automatically adjusts the speed. Remain in the middle of the deck, and the
  walking pad will keep the same pace; walk towards the front, and it speeds up;
  hang back, and it slows things down. This is a really handy feature, meaning
  you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling. The
  deck itself is nicely cushioned, and the motor is among the quietest on test.
  It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted
  by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all. Those
  wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be
  disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace
  but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a
  convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy
  underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of
  a sprint session. If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60
  walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can
  be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use. It’s a shame
  that … it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.
  Size: 143 x 55 x 13cm (LWH) Weight: 28kg Walking deck size: 42 x 120cm Maximum
  user weight: 100kg Average running cost: 2.5p/hour Incline: none Maximum
  speed: 6km/h Folding: yes, folds in half for storage *** Best walking pad for
  incline: Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus £224.99 at Mobvoi Mobvoi is best known for
  its TicWatch line of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-value wireless
  headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.
  One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a
  slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’s Home Treadmill SE, as well
  as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for
  height. The build quality is good for the price, and the setup process is
  painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into
  a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a
  versatile choice for home users. Why we love it Mobvoi manages to make its
  Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the
  price soaring. It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy,
  so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move
  around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to
  keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though. When “folded” into walking
  mode, the built-in handrail lies flat, allowing you to slide it under a
  standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust
  the speed and turn the machine on and off. It doesn’t fold in half for
  storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so
  long as you have 12cm or more of clearance. It includes a safety mechanism for
  running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the
  machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s
  no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking
  mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most
  walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous. When
  extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top
  speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice
  that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many
  – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running
  deck isn’t big enough, and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I
  tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad
  claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling
  underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed. The pad does offer an
  efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side
  tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small
  incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles. In terms of
  efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed,
  meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common
  tariffs. Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair
  with virtual workout software such as Zwift, while a built-in speaker allows
  music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great –
  you’d be far better off with a good pair of headphones instead. It’s a shame
  that … it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss, and the legs add
  only a tiny bit of incline. Size: 138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode)
  (LWH) Weight: 24.6kg Walking deck size: 42 x 102cm Maximum user weight: 120kg
  Average running cost: 2p/hour Incline: six degrees Maximum speed: 12km/h
  Folding: yes – safety handle for running *** What you need to know *** How
  much should I spend? Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most
  affordable costing about £100. Anything less than that is unlikely to last
  until the end of the month. From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about
  £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. But
  some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These
  high-end models typically cost about £500. How much room do you need? If
  you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will
  happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a
  slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle, and you’re basically there.
  Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the
  length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to
  slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in
  mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move
  without help. How easy is it to maintain a walking pad? Most walking pads come
  with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the
  underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement.
  Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the
  belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre. Quickly check the deck
  alignment and any moving parts every couple of months, and it should be enough
  to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years. Do walking pads use a lot of
  electricity? Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running
  treadmill counterparts, and they often do away with power-sapping incline
  motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.
  During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively
  standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed
  increased. Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures
  equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym
  membership, but more costly than getting out in nature. Can I run on a walking
  pad? Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on
  them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description. Some walking pads we
  tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety
  handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the
  runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a
  separate safety system: a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If
  this becomes detached, the machine shuts off. It’s worth noting that the
  general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their
  running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift
  around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer
  runs. On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off
  functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when
  using them at higher speeds. In summary, running treadmills are better suited
  to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot
  cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which makes longer, faster sessions
  more comfortable and easier on the joints. *** Leon Poultney has been

The lighter overall weight makes it much easier to move around the house than others, but I found it also started to move around underfoot, creak and generally complain a little as the speeds went beyond 8km/h. Put it this way: I don’t think this lightweight walking pad would last an indoor marathon at a training pace. As a simple walking pad to tuck under a desk, though, it’s absolutely fine. The belt needed adjusting after about a week of use, but slurping just 70W of power at 3.5km/h means it costs pennies to use daily. It’s a shame that … it cranks up to speeds of 10km/h because it doesn’t feel sturdy enough for those speeds. Size: 122 x 49 x 14cm (LWH) Weight: 19kg Maximum user weight: 109kg Average running cost: 2p/hour Walking deck size: 39 x 104cm Incline: none Maximum speed: 10km/h Folding: no Prefer to sit while you work? We’ve also reviewed the best office chairs *** Best walking pad for beginners: Urevo Strol 2E £169.98 at Amazon It’s difficult to separate the Strol 2E from the Mobvoi below, with both opting for a slimline, folding handle design that allows them to transform from simple under-desk walking pads to more traditional running treadmills. Built of sturdier stuff than its doppelganger, the Strol also brings an impressive digital offering into the mix with the Urevo smartphone and tablet app. This provides free virtual walks and collates daily, weekly and monthly workout information. With an impressively quiet and powerful 2.25hp electric motor and plenty of shock absorption underfoot, it’s a great way to rack up additional steps during the day, whether from speedier walking sessions or even light jogs. Why we love it Aside from representing excellent value for money, the Strol 2E is smaller, easier to store and less of a task to move around the house than some of its counterparts. Its slim profile means it will slip under a sofa or bed when not in use. The downside of this is a small walking deck, which is particularly lacking in length. This makes it easy to run out of room if you have longer legs, and makes faster running sessions particularly awkward for anyone taller than 5ft. Urevo opts for a folding handle that flips up in running mode. This includes a magnetic safety catch that clips to your clothes and automatically shuts off the unit if you inadvertently run out of deck space. Aside from the quiet operation, well-cushioned walking surface and low power consumption, the Strol 2E is also one of the most technologically accomplished walking pads on this list. The free-to-download app offers virtual walks and allows you to set workouts based on time, step and calorie goals. You can control the speed of the treadmill from your phone or tablet, or use a slick remote control that can also turn off the annoying beeps at the press of a button. It comes with a plastic device holder that can be clipped on to the safety handle for bingeing Netflix or enjoying one of those scenic virtual tours – although you’ll need headphones because there’s no built-in speaker. For the price, it’s an accomplished package and excellent value for money. It’s a shame that … the belt is so short, making it awkward to run on. Taller users will probably find the walking deck too small for longer strides, too. Size: 122 x 57 x 99cm (LWH) Weight: 21.4kg Walking deck size: 38 x 102cm Maximum user weight: 120kg Average running cost: 3p/hour Incline: none Maximum speed: 10km/h Folding: yes – safety handle for running *** Best foldable walking pad: BodyMax WP60 £549 at Amazon The most expensive model on test, the BodyMax walking pad also happens to be one of the best built and easiest on the eye. It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe. However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around. Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn. Very much the Porsche of the walking pad world, the BodyMax unit combines stylish looks and powerful performance – but it does require deep pockets. Why we love it Like most walking pads tested here, it comes with a small remote control to adjust the speed, but there’s also a clever automatic mode – or A Mode – that senses the foot placement and automatically adjusts the speed. Remain in the middle of the deck, and the walking pad will keep the same pace; walk towards the front, and it speeds up; hang back, and it slows things down. This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling. The deck itself is nicely cushioned, and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all. Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session. If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use. It’s a shame that … it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive. Size: 143 x 55 x 13cm (LWH) Weight: 28kg Walking deck size: 42 x 120cm Maximum user weight: 100kg Average running cost: 2.5p/hour Incline: none Maximum speed: 6km/h Folding: yes, folds in half for storage *** Best walking pad for incline: Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus £224.99 at Mobvoi Mobvoi is best known for its TicWatch line of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-value wireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK. One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’s Home Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height. The build quality is good for the price, and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users. Why we love it Mobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring. It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though. When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lies flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off. It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance. It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous. When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough, and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed. The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles. In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs. Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such as Zwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair of headphones instead. It’s a shame that … it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss, and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline. Size: 138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH) Weight: 24.6kg Walking deck size: 42 x 102cm Maximum user weight: 120kg Average running cost: 2p/hour Incline: six degrees Maximum speed: 12km/h Folding: yes – safety handle for running *** What you need to know *** How much should I spend? Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £100. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month. From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. But some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost about £500. How much room do you need? If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle, and you’re basically there. Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help. How easy is it to maintain a walking pad? Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre. Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months, and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years. Do walking pads use a lot of electricity? Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts, and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral. During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased. Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature. Can I run on a walking pad? Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description. Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system: a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off. It’s worth noting that the general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs. On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds. In summary, running treadmills are better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which makes longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints. *** Leon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.
