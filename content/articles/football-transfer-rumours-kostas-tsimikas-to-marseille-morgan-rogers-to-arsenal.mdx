  Another name is ready to graduate from the Mill. Eberechi Eze was set for a
  move to north London and, even after a late twist, that remains the case.
  Tottenham were pushing for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup Final hero but Arsenal shot
  up a hand just before the gavel hit. It makes for a romantic script – even if
  Spurs would rather shred it, set it on fire and dispose of the ashes – with
  Eze rejoining the club he was released by as a boy. Does that stop Arsenal
  being linked with Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers, price quoted at £80m? Possibly.
  Possibly not. So how about another reunion? Matty Cash, the Aston Villa
  right-back, began his career at Nottingham Forest and has been linked with a
  return to the club he left in 2020 after making 141 first-team appearances.
  The heart tugs … yet Forest are also reportedly pursuing Sevilla’s José Ángel
  Carmona to fill that position. The Mill remains contractually obliged to
  discuss Newcastle’s striker troubles: a £40m bid for Yoane Wissa has been
  rejected by Brentford while Alexander Isak waits in the wilderness. Another
  forward whose future has been discussed ad nauseum is Manchester United’s
  Rasmus Højlund, who is said to have the attention of Napoli. Milan have been
  routinely linked with the Danish striker, but have got their mitts on Bayer
  Leverkusen’s Victor Boniface instead. A move to Naples would be a decent
  sequel to Scott McTominay’s transfer last year, Højlund primed for gongs and
  parades once free of Old Trafford’s haunted spotlight. Alejandro Garnacho’s
  switch to Chelsea continues to move at a tortoise-like speed. Eze’s move to
  Arsenal presumably ends the tittle-tattle that Richarlison was going to be
  offered to Crystal Palace by Spurs in a part-swap deal. He can’t be going
  anywhere after launching the Thomas Frank era with an opening-day double,
  outrageous scissor-kick included. Tyler Dibling had Crystal Palace as possible
  suitors on this page yesterday; it’s Everton who are back making noises for
  Southampton’s £50m-rated winger. Bournemouth – who have bid farewell to Dean
  Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi this summer – are apparently
  interested in Chelsea’s Axel Disasi as they try to rebuild their backline. The
  multi-club operation strikes once again, with Brighton’s Julio Enciso expected
  to become a BlueCo man, joining Strasbourg and creating the opportunity to
  play for Chelsea down the line. Liverpool are left-back heavy with Kerkez and
  Andrew Robertson, so what does that mean for Kostas Tsimikas? His name’s been
  thrown next to Marseille’s. The club are expected to extend their PSR headroom
  by selling Harvey Elliott to RB Leipzig.
