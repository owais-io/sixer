  Even if Sarah Hall did not begin her acknowledgments by saying that it’s taken
  her 20 years to write Helm it would be evident. Not from a cursory glance at
  her bibliography, perhaps: in that time Hall has published six other novels
  and three volumes of extraordinary short stories. But in every other way, and
  the moment you begin reading. There’s the subject, for starters. Ever since
  the first paragraph of her first novel, Haweswater, in which an early
  20th-century man drives his horse and cart through the waters of a Cumbrian
  valley recently drowned by a dam, Hall has been concerned with landscape, with
  weather, with nature in all its forms, with the ways in which we affect each
  other. In The Carhullan Army, climate change has already happened. Cumbria is
  semi-tropical, temperate England a folk memory; a dystopian vision that feels,
  this baked summer, uncomfortably close to reality. The Wolf Border, published
  in 2015, was, among many other things, about the ethics and unpredictabilities
  of rewilding an apex predator, while Hall’s last novel, Burntcoat, written in
  the first lockdown, was set in and after a pandemic. Her story Later, His
  Ghost is set in a perpetual windstorm of total climate breakdown; in One in
  Four, a virologist writes to his wife, apologising for getting things wrong.
  In this new novel, weather and climate are not just potent settings but the
  main event. The central character in Helm is the Helm, Britain’s only named
  wind. This wind, which is local to Cumbria, occurs when air sweeping down
  Cross Fell, above the Eden valley, creates both a crest and a low bar of
  cloud. “Tricky to explain/visualise”, admits Helm. “For now, imagine a skater
  launching off a quarter pipe two thousand feet high, then somersaulting.
  Again. And again and again.” As the book begins, Helm witnesses its own
  arrival. An ice age, sun flares, ash cloud; and, relatively insignificant in
  the context of such deep time, the evolution of humanity. Because there are
  many people in the novel, too, which is structured by braiding their stories
  with Helm’s, but also with lists: the forces of Helm, for instance, which
  range from “0. Zero Helm (complete calm). Mean wind speed &lt; 1mph.
  Weathervanes and trees unmoving, grass still, water as mirror, smoke rising
  vertically from roundhouses/cottages/plague pyres” to “12. Hurricane Helm
  (Hand of God). Wind speed 73-83mph, phenomenal damage and widescale loss of
  life, Eden reconfigured biblically, Carlisle-Settle train lifted off the
  tracks, history made, FIN.” Other lists include names for Helm and the damage
  Helm can wreak; or the trinkets Helm collects, often after that damage (Howdah
  pistol, iron skullcap, Apple iPhone 11 64GB, Tornado F3 series, eject pin).
  The pictures humans make, trying to understand, locate, corral Helm. Helm
  finds people amusing, and watches as they succeed each other; Hall’s ambition
  may be bounded by one valley, but it reaches through thousands of years. Her
  subjects range from a neolithic tribe to a medieval exorcist; from an isolated
  18th-century wife to a quixotic Victorian meteorologist; from a wind-touched,
  lonely mid-20th-century child to a present-day academic counting plastic
  particles in the air. From stone tools to the Industrial Revolution to the
  advent of AI, each era has its own existential encounters with Helm: as deity
  or devil, as a psychological or a scientific mystery. Both sides are made
  complacent by Helm’s longevity, size and power, by human smallness and
  briefness, neither realising, until perhaps too late, that these little beings
  threaten Helm’s own existence. A project of this scope, which requires a range
  of research and imagination that could have produced several historical
  novels, not to mention an entire other volume of meteorological expertise,
  holds so much in suspension around its whirling, windy core that it could
  easily blow apart. But, despite the occasional threat or lull, Helm doesn’t.
  Partly, I would argue, this is because of Hall’s development as a consummate
  short story writer. Her novels are never less than hugely accomplished, but
  the narrative demands of the longer form, especially in more conventional
  earlier work, can sometimes dissipate the blaze of which she is capable. Hall
  is freed by the constraints of the short story – like the female sculptor in
  her last novel, Burntcoat, she burns away everything extraneous – and her work
  only gains in concentrated, suggestive power. Each strand of Helm has this
  concentration; the characters and voices could stand alone, but they flow
  together into something deep and rich, held together by the Eden valley, and
  its Helm. And by the writing. Hall’s work on place, and especially this corner
  of England, has always been virtuosic, a tough and supple poetry anchored in
  decades of attention to Cumbrian land and plants and skies. In her first
  novels it sometimes threatened to submerge everything else, but in Helm is so
  embedded on the page that it’s easy to take for granted, until you pause and
  back up to really look at the “dirty, clay-slipped sky”, or a gaggle of
  Victorian children, born into the shantytown that grows up around the railway,
  collecting on a hillside to eat magic mushrooms and stare at the “silly
  jinking stars”. Every era in Helm has its own seeing; the same land, the same
  wind filtered through time-specific fears and hopes and work, time-specific
  knowings, from a neolithic world interpreted through animal behaviour to the
  bathos of 21st-century cycling waterproofs, pub menus, emails. Hall has a
  thrilling command of vocabulary, with the concurrent deployment of etymologies
  and the hinterlands they bring; words often work not as single notes, but as
  chords, big ideas slipping in on the wakes of concrete specificities. So
  NaNay, a neolithic girl, watches as the wind approaches: “In the centre it was
  blue-grey, like bull-hide, with the dull pearl-shine of scales at its edges.
  It was faceless and its body was its only government.” The “spectral gap” is a
  technical term of modern mathematics and quantum mechanics as well as
  meteorology. But what heft and metaphorical possibility such a gap has, when a
  retired policeman in a glider is required to fly into it. Above all it is the
  wind itself that holds this vastly ambitious, serious – but also often playful
  and ironic – book together. Some might find Helm’s voice initially a little
  arch, a little unplaced relative to the human voices, but it grows on you.
  Antic, needy, angry, curious, millennia-old Helm, who gives and takes,
  fascinates and awes, is feared and loved, and loves in return; who absorbs
  violences, propitiations, yearnings, and who is now beginning to feel “a bit
  wrong”. There has been so much change, over so many millennia, but this is
  different. “It’s complicated. Hard to put Helm’s fingers on it.” It isn’t that
  Helm is old, more that “Whatever is wrong … feels insidious, sneaky,
  infectious. The surprise disease on the routine tests. Some kind of weird
  intimate growth you find accidentally and go, Jesus, how long has that been
  there? A toxic waft when you’re asleep. Lights out.” The neolithic tribe
  listens to Helm in its prime, “splintering and shredding the valley, its voice
  mourning its own violence”. In the mid-20th century Helm searches for a young
  girl, his friend, who has been locked in an asylum, and, trying to look beyond
  the valley, “rises, higher, until being is difficult”. At the 21st-century
  meteorological observation post, 2,000ft up, Helm whips and churns and “calls
  to awful prayer”. A prayer for itself, perhaps, because whatever Hall’s
  intentions – an urgent rallying, a tribute, a warning – this novel reads like
  nothing so much as an elegy. • Helm by Sarah Hall is published by Faber (£20).
