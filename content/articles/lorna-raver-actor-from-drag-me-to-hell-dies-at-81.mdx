  Lorna Raver, who played Mrs Ganush in Sam Raimi’s hit horror Drag Me to Hell,
  has died at the age of 81. According to the Hollywood Reporter, her death was
  included in the “in memoriam” section of the Screen Actors Guild’s summer
  magazine. She died in May. Raver is best known for playing the woman who
  curses Alison Lohman’s bank teller in Drag Me to Hell, Raimi’s 2009 horror
  movie. The film premiered at Cannes and made more than $90m at the global box
  office. “We just wanted to tell the story of a person who wants to be a good
  person but who makes a sinful choice out of greed, for their own benefit, and
  pays the price for it,” Raimi said upon its premiere. It received positive
  reviews from critics, many of whom praised Raver’s performance. In her review
  for the New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis called Raver “gleefully
  disgusting” while Variety’s Peter Debruge referred to her as a “memorable”
  villain. “It was a lot of fun,” Raver said in an interview at the time. “I
  mean it was gruelling sometimes but it was a lot of fun and Sam is terrific to
  work with … I was a little apprehensive going into it but I had a wonderful
  time.” Raver’s film roles also included the dark 1996 comedy Freeway alongside
  Reese Witherspoon, the Matt Dillon-led crime thriller Armored and supernatural
  horror The Caller. On TV, she was best known for soap The Young and the
  Restless, where she appeared on 26 episodes. She also had roles in NYPD Blue,
  Bones, One Tree Hill, Weeds, Nip/Tuck, Star Trek: Voyager and Grey’s Anatomy.
  She also appeared in many off-Broadway productions and was a prolific
  audiobook narrator. “I can’t say exactly why I wanted to become an actor – the
  yen was just always there,” Raver said in a 2011 interview. “It was only after
  I became an actor that I learned what I love about it: I love the chance to
  live multiple lives and I’m stimulated by the work of developing the
  discipline, skill and openness one needs in order to inhabit those other
  lives.” She retired from acting in 2014. “I always had this idea that women of
  a certain age just shouldn’t even bother to try and make it in Hollywood, and
  I have been pleasantly surprised and blessed by all the work that has come my
  way,” she said in 2009.
