  As Erin Patterson faced a plea hearing on Monday, several of her victims’
  families told the court how the media’s interest in the case had exacerbated
  their suffering. The daughter of Heather and Ian Wilkinson, Ruth Dubois, said
  the media’s behaviour had changed the way she interacts with people, leaving
  her isolated. “The intense media coverage has left me second-guessing every
  word I say, worried about who I can trust with my thoughts and feelings,”
  Dubois said in her victim impact statement. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  “It is particularly revolting to experience our family’s tragedy being turned
  into entertainment for the masses and to know that people are using our
  family’s trauma for their own personal gain.” Dubois was referring to the
  multiple books, television programs and podcasts that the crime has spawned,
  and they are all about to be rolled out. A week after Patterson is sentenced
  on 8 September, Stan will screen the first episode of a three-part
  documentary, Revealed – Death Cap Murders, from Age journalists John Silvester
  and Marta Pascual Juanola. Crown prosecutor Jane Warren said she believed the
  fascination with the triple murderer would wane, just as it has for Martin
  Bryant, who killed 35 people in the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. Justice
  Christopher Beale asked Warren: “[Did] they make a TV series out of Martin
  Bryant?” Warren: “I think it was a different time then. No Netflix, your
  honour. They make TV series out of everything now.” Warren said that even when
  the court process ends, the case will continue to attract attention:
  “Everyone’s aware that there’s going to be some other media and content that
  refers to this case that’s going to come in the next while.” Gail Patterson’s
  sister, Lynette Young, said her family was subjected to a “media frenzy” and
  Erin’s estranged husband, Simon, told the court at length of the toll on his
  family. Simon said the court process and an “occasionally callous mainstream
  media” had been dehumanising and he was critical of the “deplorable” behaviour
  of journalists who stalked him and his children and knocked on the window of
  his house in the early hours. “My kids and I have suffered many days filled
  with strangers menacing our home, brandishing notebooks, phones, cameras and
  microphones,” he said. “We have faced people waiting in ambush at our front
  door, inches away with TV camera and microphone at the ready after ringing our
  door bell.” Greener pastures The ABC’s former defence correspondent Andrew
  Greene wasted no time in getting a new gig, after resigning this week after
  the investigation of “serious allegations” he failed to disclose a junket with
  an arms manufacturer. Media Watch revealed in June that Greene filed a story
  about a German shipbuilder without disclosing that he had travelled to Germany
  courtesy of Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, which was hoping to win Australian
  navy contracts. The story, broadcast on ABC Radio’s The World Today, failed to
  disclose that the journalist had been a guest of the defence company. He did
  not tell his editor that he had travelled to Germany while on personal leave.
  On Monday, the Canberra bureau was told Greene had resigned with a note which
  added: “The ABC maintains the importance of upholding its editorial and other
  policies.” By Thursday, it became clear Greene was ensconced with another
  media giant, Kerry Stokes’ Seven West Media, when he sat with the West
  Australian at the Midwinter Ball hosted by the Federal Parliamentary Press
  Gallery in Canberra. If you’re surprised he was picked up so fast after an
  ethical breach at the ABC, you haven’t been reading sections of the media. In
  the Murdoch press, where the unauthorised trip was described as “a puerile
  travel junket”, the sentiment was that he should be rapped over the knuckles
  and given another chance. Conservative broadcaster and former Seven news
  director Jason Morrison congratulated the West for hiring Greene, calling him
  one of the ABC’s genuine news-breakers. “He stuffed-up, should have been
  kicked up the arse for it – not driven out of the organisation. ABC’s loss is
  self-funded media sector’s gain,” he said on X. Chris Dore, the
  editor-in-chief of The Nightly and the West Australian, did not respond to a
  request for comment. The former editor-in-chief of The Australian is a man who
  knows about second chances. He was let go from News Corp after reports of
  inappropriate behaviour in 2023 and then hired by Stokes less than a year
  later. Out of Szeps It’s almost two years since broadcaster Josh Szeps
  resigned from the ABC, saying he was “a bit too spicy for this gig”. The gig
  was the highly coveted Afternoons slot on ABC Radio Sydney. But after several
  run-ins with management over his content, he walked away. In November 2023
  Szeps quit live on air, telling audiences: “I’m a misfit. I’m a child of
  refugees but I’m a white Australian. I’m a gay guy but I hate Mardi Gras. I
  have Holocaust-surviving grandparents but I’m conflicted about Zionism. I’m an
  ABC presenter but I don’t like kale. Szeps now hosts a hit podcast called
  Uncomfortable Conversations on Substack and has clocked up hundreds of
  interviews with everyone from Bob Carr to Candace Owens, Antony Loewenstein
  and comedian Jimmy Carr. His podcast is ranked top 20 globally in its
  category. Last week the broadcaster spoke to Substack founders Chris Best and
  Hamish McKenzie about reinventing media. During the 90-minute conversation
  Szeps asked the entrepreneurs how much their lives had changed since they
  became successful. (And that was after he joked in the intro that they would
  discuss “why Nazis are great”). Szeps asked them if they still they do their
  own laundry. Hamish said yes, he did laundry all the time, to which Szeps
  said: “This is why Filipinos exist, Hamish. You’re not supposed to be doing
  your own laundry, not at this level of success.” On the face of it this
  comment was at least uncomfortable, but Szeps told Weekly Beast it was “a
  satire of the way that suddenly wealthy, or not even suddenly wealthy, white
  people are likely to regard the people around them as being instruments of
  their own privilege”. He was trying to “prod and tease a couple of newly
  wealthy millionaires”. “The gag is on me,” he said. “We white, wealthy,
  middle-class people only see the people around us as being helpers, and we can
  outsource all of the labour of our lives to disadvantaged people.” Szeps added
  that he doesn’t think we should be so constrained that we can’t make playful
  comments without the fear of being cancelled: “Anything that is not anodyne is
  going to be potentially offensive to somebody.” ABC’s Beijing bureau reopens
  Almost five years to the day after it had to abandon its Beijing bureau, the
  ABC has announced it will return a correspondent to China. Bill Birtles, the
  ABC’s China correspondent in 2020, left Beijing in a hurry after being
  questioned by China’s ministry of state security about a case he was not
  involved in. The bureau has been empty every since, putting an end to a
  50-year presence in China which began in 1973 with Paul Raffaele – the first
  Australian journalist to be based in Mao’s China. The ABC news director,
  Justin Stevens, said a former Middle East correspondent, Allyson Horn, will
  take up the role in the coming weeks: “Having an Australian journalist
  reporting this story on the ground for us will significantly bolster our
  reporting,” he said. Marked man (and woman) Eight years after Laurie Oakes
  leaked Malcolm Turnbull lampooning the US president, Donald Trump, at the
  Midwinter Ball, Sky News host Sharri Markson has followed suit. The speeches
  by the prime minister and opposition leader are off the record, which is
  always a stretch when they are given in front of a room full of journalists.
  The former Nine political editor broadcast leaked audio and video in 2017,
  saying he was not bound by off-the-record tradition as he did not attend the
  ball. Markson replayed the Turnbull speech on her show this week and then
  announced she too had leaked audio and would broadcast it because, she too,
  did not attend the ball “Now to the Midwinter Ball in Canberra, held last
  night – where politicians get dressed up and mingle with journalists and
  lobbyists,” Markson said. “But really, the stars of the night are the
  politicians’ speech writers, who embrace the rare opportunity to show their
  comedic prowess and crack out the jokes.” Markson went on to replay some of
  opposition leader Sussan Ley’s very well-received speech, which included a
  joke about Markson. “Albo and I are pretty different people but we do have
  some similarities.” Ley said “Sharri Markson hates me. Sharri Markson hates
  him.”
