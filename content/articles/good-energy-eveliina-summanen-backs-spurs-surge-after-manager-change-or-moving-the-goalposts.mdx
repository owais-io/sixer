  When Eveliina Summanen joined Tottenham from the Swedish side Kristianstad in
  January 2022, everything changed for her. The 27-year-old knew she was coming
  to a league with ambition, a league increasingly catching the attention of the
  best European talent, and a league that stood to benefit from a home European
  Championship that would catapult interest and growth further. “At Spurs I got
  enough support and time to kind of grow into things,” Summanen says. “I wasn’t
  just thrown into the deep end right away. I got the right support, right help
  on and off the pitch to get to where I am now. It didn’t just happen
  overnight, I just slowly, slowly kept building and that’s still what I want to
  do, keep taking steps forward.” Summanen has become a key midfield cog for
  Tottenham, and earned the award for the Women’s Super League goal of the month
  in November for her stunning 40-yard winner against Aston Villa, which was
  also voted Tottenham fans’ goal of the season, a strike she describes as a
  “one-hit wonder”. The Finland midfielder says: “It’s a good thing to keep in
  mind, getting goals and assists and to be part of that attacking game as well.
  But I’m not expecting the same kind of goal.” Her goal was a rare highlight
  amid a difficult season for Spurs who finished 11th, six places lower than in
  the 2023-24 season, the year they also reached a first FA Cup final. What went
  wrong? “To be honest, I haven’t had so much time to reflect on last season
  myself, because of the Euros and then having to switch on to preparing for the
  new season,” Summanen says. “But, obviously it didn’t go as we wished for.
  That’s just a learning curve for all of us in the club and in and around the
  team, just to remember that nothing comes for free in this league and you just
  need to work for it. “Now we have a new chance with a new coach and just a lot
  of new positive energy coming to the team. So, the best thing is to focus on
  what’s coming next and not worry too much about what happened last season.
  That’s in the past now and we can’t change it. At the end of the day, that’s
  part of football sometimes. It’s going to be tough and there will be tough
  times during the upcoming season as well.” The disappointing campaign led to
  the departure of Robert Vilahamn as manager at the end of the season. The
  former Manchester United assistant Martin Ho, who spent two years in Norway as
  manager of Brann, was appointed the club’s new head coach. “There’s not been
  that much time yet with him but he’s given us a lot of good energy and that’s
  sometimes the most important thing,” Summanen says. “Without going into too
  much detail, he’s just tweaking small things. It’s still quite hard to judge,
  but the first impression has been really good and really positive and I feel
  like there is a route for us to go down. There is so much more potential than
  what we showed last season and I think he can bring that potential out of us.”
  Summanen does not just have to throw off the disappointment of last season;
  she also has to exorcise her frustrations at Finland’s exit from the European
  Championship in Switzerland this summer, with Riola Xhemaili’s injury-time
  leveller for the hosts ensuring they qualified from Group A ahead of the
  Finns. “It was a massive disappointment that we didn’t go through,” Summanen
  says. “That was our clear goal. We were so close to it and, in my opinion, we
  played well enough to deserve that chance in the knockout stage. But if you
  don’t win the right games you don’t get enough points, and that’s what it’s
  all about.” There were positives to take from the tournament for Finland;
  after three defeats in 2022 they at least earned four points in Switzerland.
  “We’ve been taking the steps in the right direction all the time,” Summanen
  says. “We’ve shown now at the Euros that we can compete against good teams,
  but we’re not there yet and the results show that. So we need to keep on
  working and obviously we’re focusing on challenging for the next things ahead
  of us when we have our next camp.” Summanen has come a long way from
  Lappeenranta, the small town she grew up in. “I don’t think I had any other
  option if I wanted to stay in my home town than to play with the boys. So that
  was kind of put on the table for me and I felt like that was the best thing to
  do so I could be more at home and where I have my family support around me,
  which has always been massive. Now, there’s more and more options for younger
  players, younger girls, to play with and against girls. You have more teams,
  you have more competition.” Competition couldn’t be fiercer than in the WSL.
  “I think the English league is the best in the world,” Summanen says. “There
  are more and more Finnish players coming to the league, which is really good
  for us. And the Finnish girls are also getting good roles in their teams, not
  just being rotation players. “It’s great that players are able to take these
  steps. In other countries as well. We have a lot of players that are taking
  the right steps right now and searching for the best possible environment, and
  I think I’m in one here.” Get in touch If you have any questions or comments
