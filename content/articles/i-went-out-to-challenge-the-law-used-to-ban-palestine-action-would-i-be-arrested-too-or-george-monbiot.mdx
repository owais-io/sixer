  I packed a toothbrush, books and a notepad in a small rucksack, took my laptop
  from the house and hid it, gave my phone to a friend to look after and put a
  “bust card” (lawyers’ details and legal advice) in my back pocket. I wasn’t
  certain I would be arrested, but I wanted to be ready. Then I stepped, with
  other, much braver people into a legal labyrinth. So broad are sections 12 and
  13 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and so madly oppressive is the government’s
  order applying it to the proscribed protest group Palestine Action that it is
  difficult, when contesting it, to tell which side of the law you might be on,
  and what the response of the authorities might be. When people who oppose all
  forms of violence, who are trying to stop war and terrorism, are arrested on
  terrorism charges, nothing makes sense any more. In some places, the police
  have gone berserk. South Wales police, for example, arrested, among others,
  two women of 75 and 80 who were sitting peacefully in Cardiff, holding signs
  the officers alleged were supportive of Palestine Action. They used the
  extended detention powers the act permits, denied one of them essential
  medicines, broke open the doors of their homes, seized not only electronic
  devices but also books about Palestine and a Palestinian flag and appeared to
  test the food in their kitchens for radiation. Obviously, if someone has been
  arrested under the Terrorism Act they must be planning an atrocity, perhaps
  cooking up a dirty bomb (doubtless a vegan one, to boot). West Yorkshire
  police arrested a man in Leeds for holding a cartoon from Private Eye
  satirising the government’s ban. Armed police in Kent threatened to arrest a
  woman for holding a Palestinian flag, claiming that this, too, contravened the
  Terrorism Act. An officer told her: “Mentioning freedom of Gaza, Israel,
  genocide, all of that all come under proscribed groups, which are terror
  groups that have been dictated by the government.” At least he got the
  dictated bit right. Other forces seem to have decided they had better things
  to do. Or maybe, just maybe, they’ve determined that our freedom of
  expression, enshrined in the Human Rights Act, overrides the ban on free
  expression applied through the Terrorism Act. The two are in direct conflict,
  leaving the police as confused as we are. On such judgments the future course
  of your life might hang: you can receive a 14-year sentence for expressing “an
  opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation”, if you are
  “reckless as to whether a person to whom the expression is directed will be
  encouraged to support” the group. Where the boundaries of this remarkably
  vague law lie is anyone’s guess. Our local force, Devon and Cornwall, arrested
  eight people in Truro for holding signs they suspected to be supportive of
  Palestine Action. So when we informed the deputy chief constable and our local
  police station that we were planning to stage a similar protest, we had reason
  to expect arrests. It might sound crazy to invite the police to your protest
  when the stakes are so high, but there is a long tradition of such accountable
  actions. Protest is effective when other people can see you mean it: that you
  are prepared to stand for your principles – all the way to prison, if
  necessary. The most powerful response to an oppressive and unjust law, which
  limits freedom of speech, is to challenge it, openly and without fear. Around
  the country, many brave people have done so. Some belong to a remarkable breed
  of older dissidents. The woman I sat beside while we held our signs in the
  marketplace is an 80-year-old retired nurse called Mary Light. She is a gentle
  soul with a steely determination to see good done that puts me to shame.
  Rather than enjoying an easy retirement, she has been arrested 11 times for
  environmental and Palestinian causes. She has stepped up to oppose genocide
  while the UK government’s contribution to international law consists of
  approving the sale of lethal weapons to Israel and fighting in court for this
  sale to continue. All while issuing meaningless homilies about maybe not using
  those weapons to kill quite so many unarmed civilians, if you would be ever so
  kind? My own placard sought to test the free speech implications of the law.
  It stated “Palestine Action are protestors, not terrorists”. As I see it, this
  is simply an expression of opinion: a critique of an illiberal and draconian
  order. How the police and courts might see it is another matter. One person’s
  legitimate expression of opinion can, it now seems, be another person’s
  support for terrorism. Similar opinions have been expressed by the UN human
  rights commissioner, Volker Türk, and by MPs in parliament. In fact, when she
  was in opposition, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, author of the ban on
  Palestine Action, chastised the Tories for doing what she has now done. She
  told them, “the government are extending powers that we would normally make
  available just for serious violence and terrorism to peaceful protest”. She
  argued that the Tories’ proposed legislation did not respect “historic
  freedoms to protest”. Could we be arrested for making the same point? Two
  police officers arrived, loitered without intent, then dispersed before
  causing a public nuisance. I remain free, but aware that next time the outcome
  might be different. People calling for peace risk arrest and prosecution under
  the Terrorism Act, while the state terrorists murdering civilians every day
  are protected from our free speech. Misquoting Voltaire, people have often
  noted that “those who believe absurdities commit atrocities”. But it is also
  true that those who facilitate atrocities become absurd. You do not need to
  support Palestine Action to note that they were seeking to uphold
  international law by trying to stop weapons from being supplied to a state
  committing genocide. Some were acquitted on this basis. Why has the UK
  government decreed they are terrorists? Perhaps because, by supplying weapons,
  it is complicit in that genocide. If you can turn the moral dial 180 degrees,
  maybe you can keep believing you are the good guys. The order the police are
  struggling to interpret is as ridiculous as it is oppressive. Oppression and
  absurdity are never far apart. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist On
