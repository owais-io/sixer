  Good morning. Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database
  indicate five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have
  been civilians, an extreme rate of slaughter rarely matched in recent decades
  of warfare. As of May, 19 months into the war, Israeli intelligence officials
  listed 8,900 named fighters from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as dead
  or “probably dead”, a joint investigation by the Guardian, the
  Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet
  Local Call has found. At that time 53,000 Palestinians had been killed by
  Israeli attacks, according to health authorities in Gaza, a toll that included
  combatants and civilians. Fighters named in the Israeli military intelligence
  database accounted for just 17% of the total, which indicates that 83% of the
  dead were civilians. How has Israel responded? The Israel Defense Forces said
  “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without specifying which
  data the Israeli military disputed. It also said the numbers “do not reflect
  the data available in the IDF’s systems”, without detailing which systems.
  What are human rights experts and legal scholars saying about Israel’s actions
  in Gaza? Many genocide scholars, lawyers and human rights activists, including
  Israeli academics and campaign groups, say Israel is committing genocide in
  Gaza, citing the mass killing of civilians and imposed starvation. This is a
  developing story. Follow our updates here. Federal judge orders closure of
  Trump’s ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ immigration jail A federal judge in Miami ordered
  late yesterday the closure of the Trump administration’s “Alligator Alcatraz”
  immigration jail within 60 days and ruled that no more detainees were to be
  brought to the facility while it was being wound down. The shock ruling by the
  district court judge Kathleen Williams builds on a temporary restraining order
  she issued two weeks ago halting further construction work at the remote
  tented camp, which has attracted waves of criticism for harsh conditions,
  abuse of detainees and denial of due process as they await deportation. Why
  did the judge decide to close it? In her 82-page order, published in the US
  district court’s southern district of Florida on Friday, Williams determined
  the facility was causing severe and irreparable damage to the fragile Florida
  Everglades. Fed chair Powell to give high-stakes speech at Jackson Hole amid
  Trump attacks For months, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has
  ignored demands from Donald Trump to cut interest rates and defied the US
  president’s calls to resign. Today, as Trump ramps up his extraordinary attack
  on the central bank’s independence, Powell will set out where he thinks the
  world’s largest economy is headed in a closely scrutinised speech at the
  Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming. As Trump’s erratic trade strategy continues
  to enshroud the US economy in a fog of uncertainty, investors, economists and
  officials hope Powell will provide hints of the Fed’s plans for the months
  ahead. What will he be talking about in the speech? At the Jackson Hole
  symposium in Wyoming today, Powell will address the economic outlook. It will
  be the last time he speaks as chair at the annual jamboree of central bankers,
  with his term due to expire next May. In other news … The governor of
  California, Gavin Newsom, yesterday signed a sweeping redistricting proposal
  aimed at redrawing the state’s congressional boundaries to create five new
  Democratic US House seats. The California board of parole hearings yesterday
  denied the release of Erik Menendez who has spent nearly 30 years in prison
  since he was convicted with his brother of the fatal shooting of their
  parents. A federal judge ruled yesterday that Donald Trump’s former lawyer,
  Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the top federal prosecutor in New
  Jersey. Matthew Brann finds the US government used “a novel series of legal
  and personnel moves” to try to retain Habba. Kim Jong-un has hailed North
  Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes” at a
  ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state
  media said today. Stat of the day: OnlyFans owner paid $701m in dividends as
  platform readies for potential sale The owner of OnlyFans was paid $701m
  (£523m) in dividends last year as the streaming platform best known for
  offering adult content readies for a potential multibillion-dollar sale. The
  UK-based company, which offers a range of subscription-based content from sex
  workers and celebrities, reported revenue of $1.4bn in its 2024 financial
  year. Don’t miss this: The umpire who picked a side – John Roberts and the
  death of rule of law in the US In the past 10 weeks the US has witnessed an
  extraordinary outpouring of decisions from its highest court, in effect
  greenlighting the president’s explosive and law-busting agenda. As John
  Roberts, the chief justice of the US, celebrates the completion of his 20th
  year at the pinnacle of the US judiciary, he is accused of betraying the very
  legal edifice he is supposed to protect. Climate check: Solar panels in space
  ‘could provide 80% of Europe’s renewable energy by 2050’ Solar panels in space
  could cut Europe’s terrestrial renewable energy needs by 80% by 2050, a study
  has found. Using a detailed computer model of the continent’s future power
  grid, the researchers found that a system of space-based panels designed by
  Nasa could reduce the cost of the whole of Europe’s power system by as much as
  15%. It could also cut battery use by more than two-thirds. Last Thing: Ethel
  Caterham, the world’s oldest person, marks 116th birthday Ethel Caterham, the
  last surviving Edwardian and the world’s oldest living person, celebrated her
  116th birthday yesterday. She was born in England three years before the
  Titanic disaster, lived through two world wars and survived the coronavirus
  pandemic. She became the oldest living person in April after the death of
  Sister Inah Canabarro Lucas, a Brazilian nun, at 116. Sign up First Thing is
