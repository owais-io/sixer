  The Queensland government is set for a showdown over its objections to a plan
  to reopen a pill testing clinic in Brisbane with private funding. The Loop
  Australia – which operated the CheQpoint clinic in Bowen Hills, in Brisbane’s
  inner north, with public money until April – has announced a plan to reopen on
  Friday after it received a private donation. But deputy premier, Jarrod
  Bleijie, stepped in over the weekend, threatening to legislate to ban the
  practice if they did not back down. “The government’s election commitment was
  not to support publicly or privately funded pill testing. [We] will do
  whatever is necessary to enforce our position,” he said. “We do not tolerate
  it. We will not allow it and we will legislate or regulate against those
  private providers.” The former Labor government opened the publicly funded
  service in April 2024, and also backed a second clinic on the Gold Coast. The
  LNP health minister, Tim Nicholls, ordered it closed a year later on the basis
  that it was not cost-effective. An independent review of the service conducted
  for the government has not been released. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  Loop Australia CEO, Cameron Francis, said it had received a donation from
  philanthropist Tanya Nelson Carnegie and her Vasudhara Foundation that is
  sufficient to fund it one day a week for about another year. The service
  informed the government in early July, 60 business days in advance of its
  planned reopening this Friday. Francis said the service had planned to act
  according to the policy regulating – but not banning – drug checking services
  available on their website. The plan was announced publicly on Friday,
  International Overdose Awareness Day. Asked whether they would still open
  their doors, Francis said The Loop Australia was reconsidering its options
  after the deputy premier’s comments. “We’re waiting to understand what the
  government’s policy is,” he said. “We have sought meetings with the health
  minister to discuss our work a number of times, but those requests have been
  declined.” It is unclear how or whether the government could prevent the
  service from opening before the next planned sitting of parliament, in the
  middle of month. Greens MP Michael Berkman said the service had been proven to
  reduce drug use. “Before the election, the premier promised that he’d listen
  to the experts. Instead the Queensland LNP is pursuing ideology over evidence,
  setting up an absurd showdown with the experts on pill testing and drug harm
  reduction,” Berkman said. Opposition leader, Steven Miles, said the government
  had made decisions based on its ideology. “Everyone other than the LNP agrees
  that pill testing saves lives,” Miles said. AMA Queensland president, Dr Nick
  Yim, said pill testing was “an evidence-backed method of reducing harm in the
  community from drugs and other substances”. “Services that not only prevent
  harm, but keep people out of our busy emergency departments, should be
  supported,” he said. “There is no viable alternative solution to pill testing
  as an early-warning system to alert our community to the circulation of
  harmful substances”.
