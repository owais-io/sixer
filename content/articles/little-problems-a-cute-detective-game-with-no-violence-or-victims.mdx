  As the latest generation of 18-year-olds is about to find out, starting
  university is an experience fraught with minor as well as major problems.
  Oversleeping and missing lectures, forgetting where your study group is
  meeting, mislaying your books – a lot of your time is spent looking for
  things. It is these small mysteries that concern Little Problems, a cute
  detective game, in which the protagonist, Mary, must use her sleuthing
  abilities to make it through each day as a new student . Created by Indonesian
  designer Melisa, who has chosen to go by her first name only, the idea comes
  from her love of detective stories, but also her wish to take violence out of
  the genre. “I read detective comic books, novels and manga, and have been
  playing detective games since I was a kid. I like horror as well, so I
  originally thought it would be a great idea to develop a detective game with a
  horror aesthetic. But after a few weeks of consuming murder and horror stories
  24/7, I began to feel depressed, like the world was such a dark place. I
  wanted to make a story about good people who grow up and make mistakes. This
  game is all about that nice fuzzy feeling you get from solving small life
  mysteries.” In short, there is no criminal activity here. Sometimes, it is
  just about Mary trying to find a favourite earring, a friend in the crowd – or
  her mischievous cat. Each scene works like a hidden object puzzle game; you
  search a location for clues, which may be photos, notes or schedules, and then
  deduce what has happened. Who broke your favourite mug? You need to check what
  was in it, then use information about what your housemates like to drink and
  if they were around at the right time to find the culprit. Surely this is the
  most relatable crime ever investigated in a video game. The wholesome,
  low-stakes feel is accentuated by an art style that draws inspiration from
  soft manga and anime such as Doraemon, Chibi Maruko-chan and Kobo-chan. As
  with similarly domestic titles such as Unpacking and A Little to the Left,
  there is a lot of subtle storytelling going on in the background around
  friendships and family, giving weight to the simple premise. Melisa started
  the project as a quick prototype for a Twitch game jam, but ended up spending
  two years on it, bringing two other staff onboard and setting up her studio,
  Posh Cat. It has been something of a passion project. “I would love to play
  more cosy detective games, so I made one,” she says. “Here’s to more cosy
  games in 2025 and beyond!” • Little Problems is released on PC on 9 September
