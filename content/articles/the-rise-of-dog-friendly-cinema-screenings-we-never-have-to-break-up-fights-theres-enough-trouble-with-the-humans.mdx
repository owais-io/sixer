  I know we’re off to a bad start when Jean refuses to board a tube train bound
  for central London. She plants herself on the platform and will not be moved.
  In the end I have to pick her up and carry her – squirming in protest and
  heavy – over the threshold. When the doors slide shut the woman standing next
  to me in the packed carriage asks if my dog has ever been on a train before.
  “No,” I say. “Can you tell?” “How far are you going?” she says. “Canary
  Wharf,” I say, “where we change trains, and then … ” The look of concern – or
  possibly scorn – on the woman’s face is such that I don’t finish my sentence:
  and then we’re going to the cinema. To be honest, I’d rank pet-friendly
  film-going pretty low on my list of needs. Taking your dog to the cinema
  strikes me as a bizarre and counterintuitive bit of entitlement. I go to the
  cinema to get away from my dog. Dog-friendly screenings first appeared in
  Britain a decade ago and have been spreading steadily since the end of Covid
  restrictions. Greenwich Picturehouse in south-east London, where we’re
  heading, schedules dogs-allowed showings for Sunday mornings, when people are
  already out with their pets. But why? “It’s a community thing,” says deputy
  manager Mike Miles. “It gives people a chance to meet up with their dogs, and
  come and chill out. For us it’s about providing that experience. And obviously
  we get to look at the cute dogs as they come in and make a fuss of them.” I
  won’t lie: the idea filled me with such dread that I rang up ahead of time for
  some reassurance. How did it work? Did I need to buy a ticket for my dog, next
  to me? “It’s unallocated seating, just choose a seat when you arrive,” the
  customer service representative said. “And you don’t need to book one for the
  dog.” This summer, the photographer Irina Werning, who is from Argentina,
  wanted to spend a month focused on a very British story. “It had to be dogs,”
  she says. To her, dog-friendly cinema represents a level of canine indulgence
  you just don’t see in other countries. “There are 18 cinemas that offer this
  just in London,” she says, “and more across the UK. I think there is one in
  Paris.” Some cinemas restrict dogs to the floor, but the Picturehouse chain
  allows them on the seats, as long as you use one of the fleece blankets
  provided. On dog days they restrict sales to half capacity to make sure
  there’s plenty of space. They also lower the volume of the film slightly and
  keep the house lights dimly lit, making this not unlike the baby-friendly or
  “relaxed” screenings cinemas often schedule for autistic people or those with
  dementia. It opens up film-going to people who might not otherwise have access
  to it, and is an opportunity to fill cinema seats on an early weekend morning.
  Werning spent August photographing dog-friendly screenings, often shooting on
  her knees to capture the dogs’ perspective. To minimise disruption, she took
  pictures only in the 15 minutes before the film started and the 15 minutes
  after it finished. In between, she took a seat and waited. “I saw The
  Fantastic Four twice, Jurassic Park twice,” she says. “I saw Superman … ” My
  dog and I, frazzled after our journey, arrive in good time for the 11am
  showing of The Fantastic Four: First Steps. There are dogs and owners outside,
  waiting to be let in. Because we are both still mildly hysterical, we keep a
  respectful distance until the doors open. “It’s our first time,” I say to the
  woman on the refreshment stand. “Exciting!” she says. I shrug. “She knows
  nothing of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” I say. I don’t say: neither do I.
  Picturehouse launched dog-friendly screenings in 2017 and half their sites
  regularly hold them; here in Greenwich they do one or two a month. “The next
  one is The Materialists,” says the man checking tickets. “Oh, great,” I say.
  We walk in as the adverts are beginning. There are about 15 dogs in the room,
  and I pick two seats as distant from anyone else as possible – fourth row, far
  right aisle. But the place is filling up; there will be about 30 dogs by the
  end – mostly poodle crosses and sleepy lurchers. As I predicted, my dog is
  beside herself: she can’t believe she’s in a room full of dogs, without a ball
  in sight. I pat the seat beside me and she climbs on to it. Leaning in close,
  I speak to her in the quiet but commanding tone I plan to adopt for the next
  two hours. “I should warn you,” I say, “there might not be any dogs in this
  film.” It’s a question I’ve been asking myself: is dog-friendly cinema just
  for the owners? Do the dogs get anything out of going, apart from not being
  left home alone? “It’s for the humans, obviously,” Miles says. “If it’s got a
  dog in it, great, that’s cute. But you’re bringing your dog along more for the
  socialising aspect of being around other dogs and doing something new. It’s
  fun to put a dog-themed film on now and again, but we do find they sell the
  least tickets, because people are just like: why would I want to come and
  watch Beethoven?” But according to Werning, a dog angle can make a real
  difference. “Superman has a lot of scenes with dogs and people were going
  wild,” she says. “The dogs were all barking and people were laughing like an
  orchestra together, looking at each other and enjoying it.” Just before the
  lights go down in Greenwich, a couple with a tiny lapdog sit down behind us.
  Jean, a labrador cross, immediately tries to bound over the seats to introduce
  herself. The little dog growls. I grip the lead tightly. I want to explain to
  the couple that they have chosen their seats poorly; that my dog’s
  interactions with other dogs – especially tiny, hostile dogs – are
  characterised by a kind of doomed optimism. She will not give up trying to be
  friends just because the other dog hates her. Unless one of us moves, I want
  to say, we are in for a long afternoon. But the film has started and, for the
  moment at least, it’s blowing my dog’s mind. The opening montage of the
  Fantastic Four’s past heroics is probably the biggest, strangest thing she has
  ever seen. She sits bolt upright, her eyes darting all over the screen:
  explosions, music, people shouting. We’re both gripped, and neither of us has
  the slightest idea what’s going on. The dog remains rapt for almost a full
  minute before turning to look at me in perplexity, and whining softly. “The
  woman and the stretchy one are married,” I say. “That’s all I know.” Jean
  wheels round and sticks her snout between our seat backs. The little dog
  behind growls. I pull on the lead. Jean jumps off the seat and prowls around
  under my feet. The other dogs are silent and still. It’s actually one of the
  best behaved cinema audiences I have ever seen. There is an occasional yap
  from the back – perhaps three in all – but that’s it. It occurs to me that all
  these dogs have been to the cinema before. It feels as if Jean and I are the
  only ones not following the plot. Half an hour in, I produce a dog treat,
  unintentionally letting the dog see that I’ve brought the whole packet with
  me. For 15 minutes Jean is entirely fixated on my rucksack, until the treats
  are gone. Then she curls up in her seat and falls asleep. A little later, so
  do I. As I’m drifting off, I think: this must be what dog-friendly cinema is
  all about – a chance for you and your pet to sit in the dark together and
  sleep through loud noises. Then again, we could do this at home. We often do.
  Why pay to take your dog to the movies? “Lots of people I asked why they
  brought their dogs said: because it’s cheaper than daycare,” Werning says.
  “And I’m like, what? You leave your dog in daycare every time you leave your
  house? And they said yes, because the dogs suffer. This, I think, is also
  something our generation is carrying, this overprotection of pets.” I am woken
  by a sharp constriction in my left ankle – the lead is wrapped once round my
  leg and the dog is in the aisle, trying to get to a lurcher one row up and six
  seats over. The lurcher has some kind of soft toy, and Jean wants it. I try to
  calm her down, to coax her back to her seat, but she’s having none of it.
  After a blissful five-minute nap I’m suddenly back to wondering: what’s the
  worst thing that could happen, and is it about to? “There are occasions where
  dogs don’t get on with each other, little tiffs, shall we say,” Miles tells me
  later. “But we’ve never had to break anything up, which is good. It’s enough
  dealing with humans.” Jean will not retake her seat, or settle anywhere else.
  At about the hour and 10 minute mark, with my arms aching from holding the
  lead, I decide we both need a break from the film. I take the dog into the
  empty lobby, where we sit for a moment to collect ourselves. “Did you notice
  that the big stone guy was cousin Richie from The Bear?” I say. The dog stares
  up at me with a look of boundless urgency, and I decide we are never going to
  find out how The Fantastic Four ends. * * * Marmaduke One seasoned canine
  cinemagoer is Marmaduke, a 12-and-a-half-year-old pug. “He is very well
  behaved, sitting on our laps,” says Nick, watching with him at the Curzon in
  Canterbury, but he is choosy about his films: “If it’s bad, he’ll go to sleep;
  if it’s good, he’ll watch attentively.” His favourites? “Anything with fish,
  fruit or other dogs. He has good taste.” * * * Blue and Elias For Lynne, a
  trip to the Hackney Picturehouse isn’t complete without her five-year-old
  shih-tzu Blue, a “very chill dog” who typically sleeps through films. Superman
  wouldn’t normally be their first choice, but the promise of Krypto the
  Superdog sealed the deal for them, as presumably it did for Elias, too. The
  two-year-old Italian greyhound never arrives at the cinema underdressed. His
  outfit here is just one of many his film buddy Nick has styled for their
  cinema trips: “When we went to see Wicked, he wore a little witch hat.” * * *
  Brugo Brugo came to the Chiswick Cinema in London with Lino and his wife,
  Anika, who found out about dog-friendly screenings through a blogger in 2024.
  They are now a favourite outing for the laid-back 11-year-old Pomeranian
  Japanese spitz mix, who usually snoozes through the action or snacks on
  popcorn, stirring only when another dog barks: “He’s a very good boy.”
