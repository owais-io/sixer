  Ian Wilkinson says he forgives Erin Patterson for trying to murder him but
  cannot offer her forgiveness for killing three other people with poisoned beef
  wellingtons, a Victorian court has heard. The supreme court also heard on
  Monday that the prosecution and defence both agreed that Patterson should
  receive a life sentence for her crimes, which Justice Christopher Beale agreed
  were “horrendous”. Wilkinson, a pastor whose wife, sister-in-law and
  brother-in-law were killed by Patterson after they were served the lunch in
  2023, told the court in Melbourne that he had not fully recovered from the
  death cap mushroom poisoning he suffered. Patterson was convicted last month
  of murdering Heather Wilkinson, 66, and Don Patterson and Gail Patterson, both
  70, and convicted of the attempted murder of Ian. She faced a plea hearing on
  Monday, where the court heard victim impact statements ahead of her sentencing
  by Beale in a fortnight. Wilkinson, standing at the end of the bar table
  throughout court and facing Beale rather than Patterson, spoke for about 20
  minutes about the impact of what he called the “fateful lunch”. “I make an
  offer of forgiveness to Erin,” he told the court. “In regards to the murders
  of Heather and Gail and Don, I am compelled to seek justice. “Now I am no
  longer Erin Patterson’s victim, and she has become the victim of my kindness.”
  Wilkinson said he bore Patterson no ill will and his prayer for her was that
  she would use her time in custody to reform. But he said he remained troubled
  by the decision she made to kill his loved ones and to try to kill him too. “I
  am distressed that Erin has acted with callous and calculated disregard for my
  life and the life of those I loved,” he said. “What foolishness possesses
  someone to think that murder could be the solution to their problems,
  particularly people who only have good intentions towards her?” Wilkinson’s
  was the first of seven victim impact statements read in court on Monday, with
  28 tendered to the court for Beale’s consideration. He spoke of his marriage
  of 44 years to Heather and the loss of joy and silence that her murder had
  caused. She was a stay-at-home mother to their four children, he said, who
  believed her greatest work was raising them to become good people. “She was
  wise, and had skills that made up for my shortcomings,” he said. “Together we
  faced life as a team, and we delighted in each other’s company. “The way our
  children conducted themselves through the crisis of our illness and the
  subsequent legal processings is testament to her mothering skills … the trauma
  they experienced at their mother’s death, and my near death, has left deep
  wounds.” Wilkinson said it was “a truly horrible thought to live with, that
  someone could decide to take her life”. At this point he removed his glasses,
  dabbed his tears with a tissue and sipped from some water before continuing.
  “My consolation is we will be reunited in the resurrection, and the age to
  come.” Wilkinson bemoaned that “so much attention is showered on those who do
  evil, and so little on those who do good” and said he also felt that the death
  of Don and Gail was the second-greatest impact of Patterson’s crimes on him.
  Simon Patterson, Erin’s estranged husband, had his victim impact statement
  read in court by Naomi Gleadow, his cousin. He said he missed his parents and
  aunt “more than words can express, I am thankful however that they are with
  God, and I will see them again”. Simon said he believed all three could have
  lived to 100, given the genes of their parents, had they not met an untimely
  end. Their two children, a son born in 2009 and a daughter born in 2014, had
  been “robbed of … the kind of relationship with their mother that every child
  yearns for”, Simon said. He said they lived in an “irreparably broken home,
  with only a solo parent, and almost everyone knows their mother murdered their
  grandparents”, but both children remained strong and knew they would always be
  loved and supported. Simon said the court process and media coverage had been
  dehumanising. He described the “callous” and “deplorable” behaviour of
  “strangers” clutching cameras and notebooks, who rapped on the window of his
  house in the early hours of the morning and stalked him and his children,
  including filming them in public. Ian Wilkinson also remained standing at the
  bar table while his daughter, Ruth Dubois, read her victim impact statement.
  Dubois said that it was deeply disturbing that Patterson had sat at the dining
  table watching her family members eat a meal that she knew would kill them and
  then followed that up with “extraordinary lies and a complete lack of care”.
  There were multiple times that Patterson could have abandoned the plan, but
  “at every step of the way, she chose to follow through”. Dubois found intense
  media coverage compounded her grief and left her second-guessing who she could
  share her pain with. It was “particularly revolting”, she said, that some
  media were using the tragedy as “entertainment for the masses”. Dubois said
  she could also not understand, as a mother, why Patterson had acted the way
  she had, given the impact it would have on Patterson’s two children.
  Statements from Lynette Young, Heather and Gail’s sister; Martha Patterson,
  Don’s mother; Colin Patterson, Don’s younger brother; and Tim Patterson, Don’s
  nephew, were also read into court. Tim Patterson, whose statement was also
  read by Gleadow, his sister, said that he wrote in his diary on 30 July, the
  day after the lunch: “Don and Gail in hospital with apparent food poisoning
  after eating at Erin’s. Coincidence, or is [there] evil at play here?” He said
  his worst fears were confirmed the following day, when their conditions
  worsened. He had “only experienced death at a distance before this”, but then
  had to reckon with the death of loved ones, including Don, who he described as
  his role model. “Why did Erin decide she would make her life’s work a portrait
  of death and destruction?,” he said. Patterson, 50, was not required to speak
  during the hearing, other that to confirm four questions about her
  particulars: her date of birth, age, previous job and former address.
  Appearing more drawn and gaunt than when she was last in court on the day of
  her verdict, Patterson watched on quietly but appeared to become emotional
  during the statements, occasionally dabbing at her eyes and nose with a
  tissue. Beale said he agreed with submissions by the prosecution that
  Patterson’s offending was “horrendous”, a factor he had to consider in
  sentencing. The defence and prosecution agreed that Patterson should receive a
  life sentence for the murders, though Colin Mandy SC, for Patterson, said she
  should receive a non-parole period. Mandy also submitted that Beale should
  consider the onerous conditions of Patterson’s current conditions in custody.
  Jane Warren, for the prosecution, agreed that Beale could consider these
  conditions. Beale said that the fact Patterson had spent 22 hours a day in her
  cell for at least 14 months since her arrest in November 2023 “doesn’t sound
  very humane”. The court earlier heard about Patterson’s time in custody from
  Jenny Hosking, an assistant commissioner of Corrections Victoria. Patterson
  was held in those conditions because of her notoriety, which could see her
  subject to violence and vitriol from other inmates, the court heard. Patterson
  is set to be sentenced on 8 September.
