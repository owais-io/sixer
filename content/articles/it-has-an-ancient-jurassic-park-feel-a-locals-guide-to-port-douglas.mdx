  I was born and raised in Mossman, 20 minutes from Port Douglas, and have
  worked in tourism on Kuku Yalanji country since 1999. When I was young, Port
  Douglas was a bunch of local fishers, a handful of shops and the pubs. When
  the Sheraton resort opened in 1987, development really kicked off. Now it’s
  one of those scenic resort towns you find all over the world. There are no box
  jellyfish from May to October (dry season). That’s peak season so it can go
  from about 3,500 people to 10,000. Wet season is from December or January
  until mid-April. You’ll get rained on a bit but the creeks are full, the
  rainforest is lush and the energy is different with so few tourists around.
  Food Four Mile beach is on the eastern side of town, then there’s a bustling
  marina with dive shops, boat centres, cafes and restaurants. The shopping area
  is mostly on Macrossan Street. People are drawn to eat outside in the tropical
  climate so most of the restaurants have outdoor seating. Salsa Bar and Grill
  is popular; it can be hard to get in. I order a steak but lots of people enjoy
  seafood like the saltwater barramundi. The Surfy (Port Douglas Surf Life
  Saving Club) is high on the levee on Four Mile beach with an open-air veranda
  overlooking the Coral Sea. I do the trout tacos to start and then I’ll get a
  steak. It does wine matching too. Zinc is a restaurant and cocktail bar that’s
  a bit fancier. • Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Tin Shed on the
  marina does good bistro-style meals: chicken parmigiana, steaks, pastas and
  kids’ meals. It does crocodile spring rolls and tacos, and gets fresh fish
  right off the boats, like nannygai (red snapper), red emperor, Spanish
  mackerel and tuna. For coffee, Sparrow Port Douglas opens at 6am so it’s good
  for early starts. Origin Espresso roasts its own beans and has baked goods and
  French pastries. It serves cold brew, green tea lattes and chai too. Nature
  Mossman Gorge is in the south of the world’s oldest rainforest, the Daintree.
  It has an ancient, Jurassic Park-feel and is thought to be 180m years old,
  predating the Amazon by about 100m years. The Kuku Yalanji dreamtime walks at
  Mossman Gorge are called ngadiku (stories from a long time ago). There’s a
  soap and paint-making demonstration as well as bush tea and damper. The
  rainforest is so diverse. There’s red mahogany trees, red tulip oaks and old
  strangler figs. Most of the bigger animals like pademelons and wallabies are
  nocturnal but you might see forest dragons, tree snakes or pythons and there
  are plenty of birds, butterflies and insects. Port Douglas is about 30 minutes
  closer to the Great Barrier Reef than Cairns. The smaller boats are the best
  option. Sailaway operates a solar-powered glass bottom boat and goes to the
  outer reefs. You’ll likely see turtles and reef sharks as well as fish.
  Wavelength Reef Cruises is a good small snorkelling boat and Calypso Reef
  Cruises and ABC Snorkel Charters do scuba diving too. Four Mile beach in Port
  Douglas is pretty touristy. It’s the only beach with a designated swimming
  area year-round with a box jellyfish enclosure and lifeguards watching for
  saltwater crocodiles. The crocs move around the coast all year here; not only
  during the wet season. At other beaches, you might not see another person all
  day. Wonga beach is a 30-minute drive north. It’s a long stretch of white sand
  fringed with rainforest trees, coconut palms and beach lettuce. It’s fun to go
  beachcombing with kids to see different shells and driftwood. We recommend
  taking a photo and leaving things in place. Cape Kimberley beach is across the
  Mossman River and is similar to Wonga. Further north in Cape Tribulation is
  Coconut beach, where the rainforest and the reef meet. At low tide, you can
  see the reef’s northern fringe. I live at Cooya beach, five minutes from
  Mossman. The water recedes more than a kilometre at low tide and you can walk
  to some smaller sections of the fringing reef. Nightlife If you’ve been out on
  a boat all day, Hemingway’s Brewery is an easy stop on the marina. It brews
  ales, lagers, pilsners and hefeweizen (wheat beer) and serves them on a big
  open deck overlooking the yachts. Chillys Pizza has open-air dining and a nice
  little bar. You can have a punt on the cane toads too. You pick a toad and
  they race from the centre of a circle. If yours is the first toad to jump out,
  you win. It gets pretty rowdy. Jimmy Rum’s is a cocktail bar that does fancy
  drinks. It’s a city-style small bar that does cocktails with smoke and flames
  and the lot. Rattle n Hum is great for younger folk. Its kids’ meals are all
  $12, including pizza made in its large stone oven. Paddy’s Irish pub is very
  popular. It has live music on weekends, an open mic on Wednesday night and a
  Sunday roast lunch. Inspiration My company, Walkabout Cultural Adventures,
  does spearing and mud-crabbing walks on Cooya beach. You can see a beautiful
  place anytime, but people on our tours come to understand how differently Kuku
  Yalanji and Aboriginal people see things. We notice everything – the changes,
  the animals and the ecosystems. Nature is still so important for human
  survival. Janbal Gallery is an Aboriginal art gallery in Mossman run by Brian
  “Binna” Swindley. He does contemporary dot art with designs of fruits,
  medicines, seeds and wildlife from cassowaries to sea turtles, crocodiles and
  goannas. Binna’s depictions are all about how we find them. He runs art
  classes too. Mossman markets are on Saturdays unless it’s bucketing down with
  rain. There’s tropical fruits and local chocolate tastings. The vendors are
  culturally diverse and everyone’s keen for a yarn. Port Douglas market on a
  Sunday is bigger and has everything from fresh sugarcane juice to coconuts,
  chocolate-coated bananas, tandoori, massage and local buskers. Taste Port
  Douglas (6-9 August 2026) is a tropical food and drink festival based at
  Sheraton resort. They get Australian and global chefs up to do classes on
  their signature dishes, like laksa or prawn shell bisque. Accommodation
  Sheraton Grand Mirage (from $395 for an entry-level room) is the only resort
  right on Four Mile beach. It has palm trees and lagoon-style pools and is high
  end. Silky Oaks Lodge (from $1,200 a night including food, wine, minibar and
  yoga) is on the Mossman River. It’s very flash treehouse-style accommodation
  and the restaurant uses lots of native ingredients. Pullman Port Douglas Sea
  Temple Resort and Spa (from $295 for a studio room) is away from the crowds.
  You can walk out of your room right into a central pool. My kids love waking
  up and having a swim or a Jacuzzi. Mandalay (from $425 a night for a
  two-bedroom standard apartment) is great for families too and right opposite
  Four Mile beach. Tropic Breeze Caravan Park (from $38 a night for a campsite)
  is quieter than the other caravan parks. If you want party-style camping,
  Dougies Backpackers Resort (from $38 a night for a supplied tent and linen) is
  the one. Juan Walker is a Kuku Yalanji man and the owner of Walkabout Cultural
  Adventures
