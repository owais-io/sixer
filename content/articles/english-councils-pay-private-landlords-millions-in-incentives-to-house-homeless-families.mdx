  Councils across England are increasingly spending millions of pounds a year in
  incentive payments to private landlords to persuade them to house homeless
  families, with campaigners describing it as a “senseless waste of public
  money”. Data gathered by the campaign group Generation Rent via freedom of
  information requests showed that 37 councils spent more than £31m on one-off
  cash payments to private landlords on 10,792 occasions in 2024-25. The data,
  from the 32 London councils and the 10 councils outside the capital with the
  biggest statutory homelessness issues, showed cash-strapped local authorities
  are increasingly using these payments to encourage landlords to house families
  who are homeless or facing eviction. In London, the amount being spent by
  councils on incentives to private landlords has increased by 54% since 2018,
  the last time data was collected. Ben Twomey, the chief executive at
  Generation Rent, said: “The soaring cost of renting and the government’s
  decision to freeze the local housing allowance has put councils across the
  country in a near impossible position. “In a desperate bid to avoid placing
  people in temporary accommodation, they’re forced to pay individual landlords
  sometimes tens of thousands of pounds just for them to agree to rent out their
  home. It’s a senseless waste of our public money.” Manchester city council
  spent the most on landlord incentives, spending £3.3m in 2024-25, with Enfield
  council in north London spending £2.7m, Ealing council in west London spending
  £2.3m and Birmingham city council spending £1.7m. Many of these local
  authorities are facing budget deficits and pushing through cuts to services
  and council tax hikes. Manchester city council reported an £18m budget gap
  earlier this year, while Birmingham city council made the largest cuts in
  local authority history after declaring itself effectively bankrupt. The
  highest single one-off payment to a landlord, £15,385, was paid by Southwark
  council in south London, with many other councils frequently paying more than
  £10,000 to landlords. In 2018, only one council in London reported paying
  £10,000 or more in a single incentive payment, while six reported doing so in
  2024-25. Twomey described the rental market as “like the wild west”, with
  landlords “rigging the system to line their own pockets at the expense of
  people experiencing homelessness and the local councils that are trying to
  house them”. He urged the government to unfreeze local housing allowance rates
  and give metro mayors the powers to limit rent increases to help curb the
  practice. Chris Norris, the policy director at the National Residential
  Landlords Association, said the incentives were a “poor way of funding the
  housing system” but had come out of an “enormous shortfall between local
  housing allowance rates in almost every area of the country and market rents”.
  He said landlords were “increasingly finding that people who are reliant on
  local housing allowance or universal credit simply can’t afford to rent”, and
  the incentives allowed landlords to take on families who were likely to fall
  into arrears. Norris also said incentives were offered to landlords to get
  them to take on tenants “perceived to represent a higher risk”, such as people
  with substance abuse issues or who had come out of prison. “Frankly, it does a
  job and it’s probably the least bad option available to a lot of local
  authorities at the moment,” he said. “It helps landlords cover their costs and
  to offer accommodation, but it would be far more efficient and equitable if
  the government actually ensured there was a welfare system that allowed people
  to access homes in the first place.” But campaigners said the system was open
  to abuse, and landlords could play councils off against each other or issue
  eviction notices in order to gain further payment. Grace Williams, the
  executive member for housing and regeneration at London Councils, said the
  capital was grappling with “the most extreme homelessness emergency in the
  country”, and boroughs were facing huge difficulties meeting their legal duty
  to find accommodation for homeless residents. “Rather than using expensive
  hotels and B&amp;Bs, working with local landlords in the private rented sector
  can secure better outcomes for homeless families and improved value for
  money,” she said. Birmingham city council said incentive payments were a
  “necessary and pragmatic response” to the fact more than 25,000 people in the
  city were on the housing register. Ealing council said incentive payments
  helped homeless households overcome barriers in accessing the rented sector,
  such as lack of credit history, affordability or previous tenancy experience.
  A Manchester city council spokesperson said the private rented sector was
  better value for money, and more appropriate and secure, than the “alternative
  options of costly hotels and B&amp;Bs”, which were also unlawful except in
  exceptional circumstances, and time-limited to six weeks.
