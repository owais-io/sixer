  Born With Teeth review – Ncuti Gatwa simmers in Elizabethan battle of the
  playwrights

  Forget William Shakespeare. This is Christopher Marlowe’s moment. Starring
  Edward Bluemel (My Lady Jane, Killing Eve) as hardworking, wary Will and Ncuti
  Gatwa (The Importance of Being Earnest, Doctor Who) as randy, troublesome Kit,
  Liz Duffy Adams’ new chamber play squirrels the literary titans away in a room
  in 1591 to 1593, playing out an energetic, erotic version of some historians’
  suspicions that the playwrights’ lives – and Kit’s violent death – were more
  intertwined than we think. “It is a history play,” Will chides, as Kit bends
  the truth in the script of Henry VI Part I, which the two great poets are
  writing together. “All the more reason to use our imaginations,” Kit retorts
  with an exaggerated flourish of his quill. Enjoying the historical license her
  character grants her, Duffy Adams whips the competitors into a frenzy and
  releases them at each other’s throats, letting them flirt, threaten, fight -
  and very occasionally write. But the bold imagination Kit calls for in
  reframing history is restrained by Daniel Evans’ staging. Three walls of Neil
  Austin’s blinder lights form the writers’ cage. A wooden table is their stage,
  bed and barrier as their charged emotions flip-flop from rivals to lovers,
  their sometimes overly earnest outpourings sitting flush with stabbing insults
  and religious musings. The sharp shock of innovation in the opening scene
  exists in isolation, with the rest of the show relegated to the two men
  prowling around the table. Bursts of violent action are reserved for mid-act
  screens, though tension is diffused as Will steps out to address the audience,
  undermining the intensity of the locked-door environment. Bluemel is a raggedy
  Will, shedding his initial weediness as his star rises. We watch as his
  reputation shifts from a wry whine that “no one’s studying me”, to an aside
  referencing his legacy where, “well,” he shrugs, “you know”. Sincere where his
  counterpart is scandalous, Will grapples with his feelings for Kit,
  simultaneously desiring acute proximity and terrified of giving in to
  temptation. But this is Gatwa’s show. His boisterous Kit sweats in Zoë
  Thomas-Webb’s leather two-piece, his every lithe action a flirtation. He
  lunges towards Will first out of pure instinct, as something to shag, but he
  grows gentler, softened by his literary sparring partner. Beneath his restless
  exterior, he hides genuine admiration for his uncertain lover and unmistakable
  fear for the murky waters he has waded into. The Elizabethan England Duffy
  Adams paints is one of heavy surveillance, as Kit tries to lure Will into his
  underworld of royal spies. But for all we’re told of the dangers outside this
  room, they remain at a distance. The stakes simmer throughout but never reach
  boiling point. The ego-pumped versions of these men we see on stage would be
  delighted to know audiences and academics continue to ogle their lives and
  work – though Kit would no doubt be fuming that Will’s star has so drastically
  eclipsed his. An intelligent slice of historical fiction that offers muscular
  performances and reminds us to lavish more attention on the other great
  Elizabethan playwright, Born With Teeth yearns for a sharper bite. At
  Wyndham’s theatre, London, until 1 November
