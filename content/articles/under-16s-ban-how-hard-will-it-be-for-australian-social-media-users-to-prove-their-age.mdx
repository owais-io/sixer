  Under-16s ban: how hard will it be for Australian social media users to prove
  their age?

  It could take just 40 seconds: that’s how long Australians might have to wait
  for age assurance technology to assess they’re allowed to be on social media
  from December, when the under-16s ban comes into effect. But the reality is,
  for many users, it could be a much more complicated and time-consuming
  process. The official trial of age assurance technology, whose report was
  published on Sunday, found that facial age estimation tests – which estimate a
  user’s age using an image of their face – took on average 40 seconds. But in
  the datasets the trial has released, it took some users between 10 minutes and
  an hour to get through the process. That’s before taking into account whether
  the system has correctly estimated their age. The federal government and the
  trial report downplayed concerns about error rates in facial age estimation,
  but the report acknowledged there will be errors, particularly for users
  closer to the 16-year-old age limit. Yoti – one of the more mature age
  assurance technology providers tested in the trial – had results showing an
  error rate of 34% for 14-year-olds and 73% for 15-year-olds, where the system
  incorrectly said those users were 16. For a social media ban aimed at keeping
  13- to 15-year-olds off social media, that’s a massive cohort that could
  potentially escape the planned ban. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The data
  reveals some of the age estimations can vary widely, particularly if you are
  non-Caucasian, female or older, according to the report. The data reveals one
  12-year-old was estimated to be 85. The report conceded that errors in age
  estimation technology were inevitable and fallback options would be required
  for platforms where the user says they’re not the age the technology guesses
  they are. That would probably lead anyone wrongly assessed as being under the
  age limit to have to provide IDs such as passports to be able to get on to
  social media – a much more privacy-intrusive method of verifying age.
  Worryingly, the report found some of the providers offering age verification
  tools were preempting expectations from law enforcement that the
  identification data might need to be retained for other purposes, which the
  report noted could risk privacy breaches. Concerns around wrongful bans What
  if someone doesn’t have an ID or can’t get back on to the platforms despite
  the additional hurdles? The communications minister, Anika Wells, said the
  government was mindful that wrongful bans could an issue, and under the rules
  there should be a way for people to appeal against a decision and that should
  happen quickly. However, any reporter working in the technology space in the
  past few months would know that Meta, in particular, is often not responsive
  to users requesting appeals when their accounts are banned. Whether the
  company develops a sudden sense of urgency for these accounts remains to be
  seen. Tellingly, in media interviews on the report on Monday, Wells talked up
  what is referred to in the report as “age inference”. This is the most
  frictionless and least privacy-invasive method. There is a view that social
  media companies collect vast amounts of data on their users already and,
  through this data, they can figure out the age of each user. A user, for
  example, who joined Facebook in the Kevin ‘07 era would be well past the age
  cut-off. There are also behavioural signs. Wells used the example of
  interacting on social media with retirees about caravanning being an indicator
  someone is older, and talking about Kpop Demon Hunters with 13-year-olds being
  a sign someone is a teenager. In an ideal world, in around 100 days when the
  ban comes into effect, the platforms will use this method for the vast
  majority of adults and no one will notice. That may be the case for some
  platforms – and we don’t know which method any of them will use yet – but
  smaller providers or those that deliberately avoid collecting much information
  on their users will have to employ some of the other methods. Some smaller
  providers may choose to opt out of Australia entirely. Twitter-X alternative
  Bluesky blocked users in Mississippi last month after a similar age assurance
  law passed in the US state, citing costs in developing age verification
  systems and lack of resources. Bluesky has not said what the plan is for
  Australia yet, but it’s not difficult to predict some smaller companies will
  choose to opt out of Australia altogether rather than face either the cost of
  compliance or fines of up to $50m. Josh Taylor is Guardian Australia’s
