  Democratic leaders across Illinois and Congress are condemning Donald Trump’s
  reported plans to send national guard troops to Chicago, denouncing what they
  call an unprecedented abuse of presidential power. The Illinois governor, JB
  Pritzker, is set to hold a news conference alongside the state’s attorney
  general, Kwame Raoul, later on Monday to formally oppose any federal troop
  deployment in the city. Pentagon sources confirmed to news outlets that
  planning is actively under way for the operation, though no final decision has
  been announced. Pentagon officials also told Fox News ahead of the weekend
  that up to 1,700 national guard personnel are prepared to mobilize across 19
  predominantly Republican states from August to mid-November to support
  immigration enforcement operations. Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, said the
  targeting of Chicago was “the most flagrant violation of our constitution in
  the 21st century” and promised court battles if troops arrive. Johnson also
  said his office received no direct communication from the White House
  regarding the reported plans. The deployment would mark an expansion of
  Trump’s domestic military operations, which have already seen armed national
  guard troops patrolling Washington DC and Los Angeles, which faces ongoing
  federal occupation despite legal challenges. The House minority leader, Hakeem
  Jeffries, accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis to justify the unprecedented
  move, responding to reports of the administration’s planning. Speaking on
  CNN’s State of the Union, the New York Democrat said the president was
  “playing games with the lives of Americans” through his domestic military
  deployments. “There’s no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially
  try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago,” Jeffries said. The
  Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth slammed the proposal as a dangerous
  distraction designed to “intimidate Americans in their own communities” and as
  a sort of red herring to deflect criticism from Trump’s unpopular policies.
  Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois branded the plans an “illegal
  attempt to militarize Chicago” that would “spark chaos and create spectacle”
  rather than address genuine public safety concerns. While presidents can
  federalize national guard units, their authority over cities beyond Washington
  DC is limited without the governor’s consent, typically restricting operations
  to protecting federal buildings and personnel. Meanwhile, California’s court
  challenge to Trump’s LA deployment remains unresolved. As for where the
  Pritzker stands, he accused Trump of attempting to “manufacture a crisis,
  politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to
  distract from the pain he is causing working families”. A spokesperson for the
  Pentagon would not confirm to the Guardian whether the national guard
  deployment would materialize in Chicago. “We won’t speculate on further
  operations,” a defense official said. “The Department is a planning
  organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans
  to protect federal assets and personnel.” Despite the opposition, some
  conservative voices in Chicago have expressed support for additional law
  enforcement presence. The group Chicago Flips Red argued that federal
  intervention may be necessary if local authorities can’t control crime.
