  The UK’s highest court is poised to give its verdict on the £44bn car finance
  scandal, which could pave the way for millions of motorists to claim billions
  of pounds in compensation for mis-selling. The supreme court judgment, which
  will be handed down after financial markets close at 4.35pm on Friday, will
  decide whether or not to uphold a finding by the court of appeal in October
  that hidden commissions paid to car dealers by lenders were unlawful. That
  ruling, based on test cases, said making such payments to brokers who arrange
  car loans without disclosing the sum and terms to borrowers was unlawful. The
  lenders involved in the case – FirstRand Bank and Close Brothers – appealed
  against that decision to the supreme court. The vast majority of new cars,
  about 90%, as well as many secondhand cars are bought using finance
  agreements. If the UK’s most senior judges uphold the earlier decision in its
  entirety then those customers could be entitled to billions in compensation,
  leading to huge liabilities for lenders. Lloyds Banking Group, which is one of
  the most exposed to the scandal through its Black Horse division, has already
  put aside £1.2bn for potential compensation. The industry, led by the
  Financing &amp; Leasing Association, which represents car lenders, argues it
  has done nothing wrong. Thousands of vehicle buyers were already in line for
  payouts if they bought before 2021 with a form of car finance banned that year
  by the Financial Conduct Authority, known as discretionary commission
  arrangements (DCAs). They meant some dealers received a bigger payment if they
  got car buyers to sign up to a higher rate on a loan. The FCA is likely to set
  up a central compensation scheme for drivers mis-sold loans through DCAs, and
  has said it will confirm whether it will do so within six weeks of the supreme
  court’s judgment. However, if justices also uphold the appeals court decision
  in its entirety, that could widen the pool of potential claimants
  significantly. If they side with lenders, then the scope of payouts to
  motorists will be much more limited. In February the supreme court rejected an
  unusual intervention by the government, which was concerned that huge amounts
  of compensation payments could dramatically affect the car market. The
  Treasury has said that it wants to see a “balanced judgment” to compensate
  consumers who were mis-sold loans while also allowing the car finance sector
  to continue to support motorists who need loans to buy vehicles.
