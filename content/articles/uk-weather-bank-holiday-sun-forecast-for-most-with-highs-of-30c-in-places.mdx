  Bank holiday temperatures are expected to soar to near 30C (86F) across parts
  of the UK on Monday before the remnants of Hurricane Erin bring wind and rain.
  Maximum temperatures on Sunday will be about 26C or 27C, then those attending
  Notting Hill carnival in London on Monday can expect it to reach 28C or 29C
  with widespread sunshine for most, the Met Office said. However, the weather
  is expected to cool by late on Monday as the remnants of Hurricane Erin bring
  rain and wind, which will continue throughout the week, the Met Office
  meteorologist Craig Snell said. For the rest of the week temperatures will be
  closer to average – low 20s in the south and high teens across the north.
  Snell said: “Today and tomorrow it will be largely dry across the UK apart
  from the odd spot of rain across Scotland today. There will be increasing
  amounts of sunshine and temperatures continuing to climb. “On Monday it will
  be a very warm and sunny picture for most. It will start to go downhill and
  rain will start to move in for Northern Ireland into the afternoon.” People
  planning to head to beaches on Monday or Tuesday are being advised to go to
  those with lifeguards as big waves are expected. From Tuesday onwards, spells
  of rain will be moving across all parts of the country, and it will be wettest
  in the west, Snell said. He downplayed the potential impact of Hurricane Erin
  on UK shores, which is now a category 2 storm moving eastwards across the
  North Atlantic. “It will be heavy at times in the west, but at the moment
  we’re not expecting too many impacts, and it may for farmers or anyone who
  needs the rain be welcome,” he added. On Wednesday, a band of rain will move
  across the whole country, and low pressure will remain until the weekend with
  further spells of rain. Hurrican Erin has lost some strength in the past week
  as it moved along the east coast of North America, having been classified
  previously as a category 5 storm, but has still caused more than 2,000 people
  to be evacuated in North Carolina and at least 60 swimmers to be rescued from
  rip currents at Wrightsville Beach on the state’s southern coast on Monday.
