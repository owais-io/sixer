  Good morning. The Republican-controlled Texas House passed a redrawn
  congressional map requested by Donald Trump on Wednesday despite the attempts
  of Democrats to thwart it. The redistricting vote came after weeks of protests
  by the Democrats, with a group of Democratic lawmakers leaving the state in
  order to stall the vote. They returned after California began advancing a
  redistricting bill to neutralize the Texas plan, which will hand the GOP up to
  five more congressional seats in the southern state. What happens now? The
  measure will go to the state senate, where it is expected to pass, before
  being signed into law by the state’s Republican governor. Could other states
  do the same? Yes – Trump has said “Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to
  do the same thing”. Even Democrats highly opposed to the brazen practice of
  gerrymandering are backing aggressive efforts to counter the Republicans’
  efforts. Trump to target Smithsonian museums to ‘get the Woke out’ The White
  House has flagged seven Smithsonian museums for review, the Guardian can
  reveal after it saw a document that details examples of how the popular
  museums are said to be casting US history in an over negative light. Based on
  public submissions shared with the administration, the document identifies
  what it views as problematic exhibits at seven different museums. This
  includes a Benjamin Franklin exhibit that links his scientific achievements to
  his ownership of enslaved people. It is the latest example of the Trump
  administration’s push to reshape cultural institutions. Under pressure, the
  Smithsonian has already changed an exhibit referencing Trump, removing all
  mention of his impeachments from a presidential power display at the American
  history museum in July. What has the administration been asking for? It has
  instructed museum officials to issue “content corrections” including replacing
  “divisive” language. Uganda reaches agreement with US to take in some of its
  asylum seekers Uganda has struck a deal with the US to take in deportees from
  third countries who may not get asylum but are “reluctant” to go back to their
  home countries, according to Uganda’s foreign ministry. The east African
  country will not accept people with criminal records or unaccompanied minors
  under the temporary arrangement, the foreign ministry’s permanent secretary
  said in a statement. He did not say whether Uganda would receive payments or
  other benefits, or how many deportees it would accept. Which other third
  countries has the US deported people to? In July, the US deported five people
  from various countries to Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), where they remain
  imprisoned, and eight to South Sudan. In other news … North Korea has a built
  an “undeclared” military base near its border with China that may house its
  long-range ballistic missiles, posing a “potential threat” to the US and east
  Asia, according to a report. JD Vance was booed as he posed for photos with
  national guard troops in Washington DC on Wednesday, with protesters shouting
  slogans such as “Free DC”. Campaigners are calling on Tanzania to free a
  victim of domestic violence with severe intellectual disabilities who has been
  on death row for 13 years. Brazil police have accused the former president
  Jair Bolsonaro of plotting to flee to Argentina ahead of the verdict in his
  trial for allegedly plotting a military coup. Stat of the day: Children
  exposed to corporal punishment are 24% less likely to be developmentally on
  track Children exposed to corporal punishment were 24% less likely to be
  developmentally on track than those who were not, according to a report that
  looked at 49 low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization
  labeled corporal punishment a global public health concern, warning that it
  seriously harms children’s physical and mental wellbeing and can lead to
  criminal behaviour. Don’t miss this: ‘Pregnant, homeless, what now?’ The
  search for a safe place to abandon a baby As far as records go back, we know
  that women have made the desperate decision to abandon their babies. The
  controversial baby window, which allows women to give up their newborn
  anonymously, has made a comeback globally since start of the 21st century. But
  does the modern iteration of the foundling wheel help or make matters worse?
  Climate check: Californians brace for worst multiday heatwave of the year
  Californians are bracing for 2025’s first major heatwave that could bring
  dangerous triple-digit temperatures. It is expected to last for multiple days
  and could pose significant health risks and severely increase the chance of
  wildfires. Fueled by the climate emergency, extreme heat is already the most
  deadly weather-related disaster in the US, and deaths are rising. Last Thing:
  Bare with me? How the thong bikini took over Thong bikinis are having a
  moment. What was once the preserve of Brazilian beaches and Love Island is now
  everywhere, writes the Guardian’s assistant features editor Leah Harper, who
  even spotted the skimpy bikini being worn at a Scottish loch. Harper
  investigates what’s behind the rise of the itsy-bitsy bathing suit. Sign up
