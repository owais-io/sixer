  The co-founder of Palestine Action has accused ministers of making false and
  defamatory allegations about the banned group, and of contradicting their own
  intelligence assessments in an attempt to justify recent mass arrests. The
  government has come under pressure to justify the detention of 532 people
  arrested over the weekend under the Terrorism Act – half of whom were 60 or
  older – on suspicion of showing support for Palestine Action. The number of
  people arrested for peaceful protests, together with the images of older
  people being led away and the demands placed on the criminal justice system,
  have led many to call into question the criminalisation of so many people. On
  Monday, a Downing Street spokesperson responded by saying Palestine Action,
  which last month became the first direct action protest group to be banned,
  was “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury,
  extensive criminal damage”. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the BBC
  that Palestine Action “is not a non-violent organisation” and claimed that
  court restrictions meant people “don’t know the full nature of this
  organisation”. But Huda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action, said: “Yvette
  Cooper and No 10’s claim that Palestine Action is a violent organisation is
  false and defamatory and even disproven by the government’s own intelligence
  assessment of Palestine Action’s activities … “It was revealed in court during
  my ongoing legal challenge to the ban that the Joint Terrorism Analysis
  Centre’s (JTAC’S) assessment acknowledges that ‘Palestine Action does not
  advocate for violence against persons’ and that the ‘majority’ of its
  activities ‘would not be classified as terrorism’. “Spraying red paint on war
  planes is not terrorism. Disrupting Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer,
  Elbit Systems, by trespassing on their sites in Britain is not terrorism. It
  is the Israeli Defense Forces and all those who arm and enable their war
  crimes who are the terrorists.” JTAC, a government body based within MI5,
  produced a secret report on 7 March which was disclosed in the high court.
  While recommending banning Palestine Action, JTAC said the group “primarily
  uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to
  property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and
  lock-ons,” it added. Defend Our Juries, which has organised multiple
  demonstrations, including Saturday’s, in support of Palestine Action, also
  highlighted Whitehall officials’ description – again in documents revealed in
  court – of a ban as “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an
  organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism
  mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to
  property”. A Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: “It is despicable that under
  political pressure, Yvette Cooper is now actively misleading the British
  public about the nature of Palestine Action, knowing that if people come to
  their defence to counter her disinformation, she can have them jailed for 14
  years [because they could be deemed to supporting a proscribed group].” The
  group said many hundreds of people had already committed to the next protest,
  which is likely to take place in early September and to be on an even larger
  scale. Uncertainty remains over the status of charges and prosecutions. Tom
  Franklin, chief executive of the Magistrates’ Association, said: “Based on the
  information that we currently have, and the statement put out by the
  Metropolitan Police yesterday [Sunday], it could take days and possibly weeks
  for decisions to be made on whether or not to charge any of those arrested
  over the weekend. Many of these cases may also be heard in the crown courts,
  rather than magistrates courts.” Magistrates courts hear less serious cases,
  although some charges under section 12 of the Terrorism Act are “either way”,
  meaning the defendant can choose whether to be tried before magistrates or a
  jury in the crown court. The Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: “Personally
  I would go to the crown court because I know where the British public is, both
  on the genocide in Gaza and secondly on the British government’s support for
  it, and thirdly on people not being allowed to express their opinions.”
  However, they added that they expected most charges to be laid under section
  13, which are all heard in the magistrates courts, as the criminal justice
  system would not be able to cope with so many jury trials. • This article was
  amended on 12 August 2025 to clarify that offences under section 13 of the
  Terrorism Act are dealt with by magistrates; offences under section 12 are
  dealt with “either way”.
