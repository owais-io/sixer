  It was grip-and-grin time for Ursula von der Leyen as she sat across from
  Donald Trump in Scotland last week, with the two announcing a deal for 15%
  tariffs on European imports that would avert a transatlantic trade war – but
  came at a stiff price for the 27-country bloc. After committing to a
  unilateral US raise on tariffs that came on the heels of a Nato commitment to
  increase defense spending to 5% of national GDPs, von der Leyen then thanked
  Trump “for his personal commitment and his leadership to achieve this
  breakthrough”. “He is a tough negotiator, but he is also a dealmaker,” she
  said, as the US president beamed. The EU was one of just a number of parties
  to strike a deal with Trump before his temporary pause on new tariffs came to
  an end this week. And like many others, the guiding principle for the EU
  appeared to be: it can always get worse. “This is clearly the best deal we
  could get under very difficult circumstances,” Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade
  chief, said. Others had a far bleaker interpretation of the dynamics, as Trump
  has wielded the threat of sky-high tariffs to cudgel his trading partners into
  submission. “It is a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, brought
  together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests,
  resigns itself to submission,” wrote the French prime minister, François
  Bayrou. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán put it another way: “It was
  Donald Trump eating Ursula von der Leyen for breakfast,” he said on his
  podcast. Later, he called her a “featherweight”. World leaders have been
  forced to adopt a position of appeasement and pragmatism as they’ve approached
  the Trump administration, which has swung between imposing staggering tariffs
  on imports and then announcing last minute pauses and exclusions that suggest
  there is little rhyme or reason to the White House’s tariff strategy. But the
  key factor for Trump appears to be taking whatever he can get. Countries
  across Asia exporting to the US were quickest to begin negotiating new trade
  deals with the White House. Vietnam was desperate to cut a 46% tariff imposed
  on the country, and Trump early last month announced that he had negotiated a
  20% rate with Vietnamese negotiators. Except, it turned out, they believed
  that they had negotiated an 11% rate, Politico reported. And treasury
  secretary Scott Bessent this week admitted that he had never seen the deal,
  which the Vietnamese authorities have never confirmed. Trump reportedly used
  the trade threats along with other incentives in order to broker a recent
  peace between Thailand and Cambodia after fighting broke out along the border
  between the two countries. He soon announced a 19% rate – a significant cut
  from 49% for Cambodia and 36% for Thailand – which appeared more motivated by
  international politics than trade considerations. But while many countries in
  the region will breathe a sigh of relief as they avert sky-high tariffs, some
  see a new danger in the arbitrary redrawing of the US’s trade relationship
  with the world. “What we felt during this negotiation is that the US trade
  environment is fundamentally changing,” South Korean trade minister Yeo
  Han-koo said shortly after a deal was made to tariff imports at 15%, down from
  a threatened 25%. The two sides had made a verbally agreement but had not made
  a formal draft, he said, because the deal had to be struck so quickly. “I
  think we are entering a new normal era,” he said. “So, although we have
  overcome this crisis, we cannot be relieved, because we do not know when we
  will face pressure from tariffs or non-tariff measures again.” Leaders who
  have stood up to Trump are having the hardest time. Among others, Trump has
  focused his ire on Canada, which he has blamed for the fentanyl crisis in the
  US, a charge that Canada’s prime minister Mark Carney has rejected. Trump on
  Friday announced that he would raise tariffs on Canada, a top trading partner,
  to 35%, as tough negotiations between the two sides continued. Carney, who had
  coined the elections slogan “Elbows up, Canada” as a signal of defiance
  against Trump’s tariff and annexation threats, said he was “disappointed”.
  “While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading
  relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control:
  building Canada strong,” Carney said.
