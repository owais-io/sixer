  Good morning. After a bruising leadership contest, Zack Polanski didn’t just
  win the Green party vote, he cleaned up. His “eco-populist” platform – which
  borrowed directly from Nigel Farage’s playbook – earned him 85% of votes.
  Polanski defeated Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, winning 20,411 votes
  relative to their 3,705 in a ballot of party members. The contest exposed
  deeper questions about Green party identity and how it positions itself amid a
  rapidly shifting political landscape. Essentially there were two options for
  members: a small-c conservative party (which Polanski characterises as
  over-timid and uninspiring) or a more radical, polarising one (which risks
  alienating moderate voters). They gambled on the latter. And so a party
  typically seen as so collegiate and cautious is taking a step into the
  unknown, voting in a spikier, more media-focused leader. I spoke to the
  Guardian’s senior political correspondent Peter Walker about what this win
  represents for green politics, and whether Polanski will woo voters. Five big
  stories UK news | Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit their highest
  level in 27 years, intensifying the pressure on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,
  before the autumn budget. Spain | Europe and western countries’ double
  standards over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine their global
  standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has warned. Brazil |
  Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his allies, including
  four senior members of the military, have gone on trial for allegedly
  attempting to stage a coup. China | Xi Jinping warned the world faced a choice
  between peace or war as he capped a week of diplomatic grandstanding with
  China’s largest-ever military parade, flanked by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and
  North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. UK news | Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered
  teenager Brianna Ghey, and the Oscar-winning actor Kate Winslet are calling on
  Keir Starmer to legally ban smartphones in schools. In depth: ‘The one thing
  it won’t be is boring’ Polanski is a 42-year-old, media-friendly former actor
  who lives in north-east London and has been Green party deputy leader since
  2022. He has previously expressed questionable views about hypnotherapy and
  breast enlargements, and loves going on hostile radio shows and afterwards
  arguing with presenters over X (formerly Twitter). His critique of the Green
  party is that change has been too slow, and as such, the party is getting left
  behind, not least with the rapid growth of Reform UK. “One of the curses of
  the Greens is that almost all their senior leaders are just very reasonable
  people,” said Peter Walker. “They don’t really like getting into these kinds
  of debates and giving these slightly populist talking points. And I’m not
  saying that Polanski isn’t reasonable, but he’s more a creature of the more
  modern age.” Polanski beat Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns who were seen as the
  co-leaders of choice for party establishment types, including former leader
  Caroline Lucas. They promised to gradually keep winning more council and
  parliamentary seats. Of course the Greens are a radical leftwing party (in
  their 2024 election manifesto they promised wealth taxes, nationalised
  utilities and a ban on some short-haul flights) but they have also made gains
  by appealing to a larger group of voters who are typically more centre or
  rightwing. The Polanski wing of the Green party, on the other hand, is more
  aligned with Corbynism-style politics, saying he would be willing to cooperate
  in a leftwing alliance with Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana. This may appeal
  to younger, more urban voters but it could scare away older, rural, Tory and
  Lib Dem-leaning voters. Ramsay and Chowns warned that the Greens risked
  becoming “a Jeremy Corbyn support act”. *** How much will Polanski change
  things? In terms of policy, probably not much. The Green leader in England and
  Wales has very limited power (the party didn’t even have a leader before 2008)
  with members having much more control than they do in other parties. “Even
  now, the leader has zero say over policy,” said Peter. According to the party
  itself, the primary purpose of the leader is to “provide visionary leadership
  and direction for the party”. Leadership contests are generally polite. “Every
  year I go to the Green conference, write one story from it, and no one really
  reads it because they do things in this quite sensible way. And there’s not
  really any big arguments. There’s not any kind of drama,” said Peter. This
  year’s race has been unusually divisive and attracted more attention This is
  partly down to Polanski, who has generated headlines by announcing his
  leadership bid to journalists before his colleagues, while also praising
  Farage’s storytelling techniques and the importance of connecting with anger.
  It is also because the party is getting stronger and there are more people
  with skin in the game. It now has four MPs and more than 800 council seats,
  clocking up 10% of support in polls. In debates Chowns has been horrified by
  the idea that the Green party could learn anything from Farage’s campaign
  style, while Polanski says the opposite. “The leader is the person to whom the
  media will kind of gravitate towards for any views. And that’s why it could be
  a significant change, because Polanski is quite a different beast to what
  they’ve had in the past,” said Peter. In his winning speech Polanski said the
  political space had become ripe for charlatans like Farage who pretend to
  serve working-class communities but are actually destroying our democracies,
  so he felt a moral responsibility to step up and be bold. *** What does the
  Green party membership make of him? Given his convincing win, it’s fair to say
  the membership likes him. But he remains divisive. Senior figures and some
  party veterans don’t like his “fighty language” – for example he directly
  challenge mainstream narratives about small boats as “bullshit” – which runs
  counter to the Green’s traditionally calm approach. One figure told Aletha Adu
  he felt uncomfortable with Polanski’s “violent metaphors”, saying that the
  party values persuasion not confrontation. He announced his leadership bid in
  a Guardian interview, with one member describing it a “hostile takeover” as no
  one knew he was planning to go for leadership and has since caused an influx
  of new members who are “very much from the left”. There are concerns that he
  could mess up years of work and process from the Greens, with Ramsay barely
  bothering to mask his disdain for Polanski’s approach. Others have been buoyed
  up by his energy which has resulted in so many new members. “During the
  leadership race, some senior greens I’ve talked to have been saying ‘I’m not
  sure about him’,” said Peter. “But a lot of them are saying he’s brought this
  real enthusiasm to the party … There’s a lot of new members coming in saying,
  I’m here because I think Zack is great.” *** What will voters make of him? It
  remains to be seen if Polanksi will cut through with voters. “It’s a bit of a
  punt by Green membership that he’s going to be able to do what he promises to
  do, which is to make a slightly Farage-like image and seize attention.” It is
  perhaps particularly risky, because leaders have had a good run of it over
  recent years. In 2024 the Greens took three new seats: one from Labour and two
  from the Conservatives. They held their existing seat in Brighton Pavilion.
  They went from one MP to four, which many said couldn’t be done. But these
  incremental gains may be too slow. “Politics is moving a bit too quickly,”
  said Peter. “Reform UK has already got many more members than the Greens … and
  could potentially form the next government. The Greens are nowhere near that.
  The thing is it needs to move a bit more quickly.” The thing to watch is
  whether Polanski can deliver on this communications style and also keep the
  party’s core member base on board, Peter noted. But whatever happens, said
  Peter: “The one thing it won’t be is boring.” What else we’ve been reading I
  loved reading this dispatch by journalist Iman Amrani about the joy of taking
  her twins to festivals this summer, where they could suspend reality and soak
  up the magic. It has inspired me to be brave and take my own little ones next
  year. Aamna Survivors of Afghanistan’s earthquake share moving testimonies
  about being buried under rubble, seeing their homes washed away, and worst of
  all, discovering how many of their loved ones had been killed. Phoebe I have
  yet to visit the UK’s first permanent exhibition and cultural space dedicated
  to Somali heritage. Reading this piece by Sundus Abdi on its power has made me
  realise I need to correct that immediately. Aamna In awe of IT consultant
  Julie Williams who is so committed to ball pits she had one installed in her
  house. Potential buyers have been told they can keep the balls. All 11,300 of
  them. Phoebe Calling all space nerds: the James Webb space telescope has
  spotted an ancient, “nearly naked” black hole that astronomers believe may
  have formed in the first fraction of a second after the big bang. If
  confirmed, it could upend our prevailing theories of the universe. Aamna Sport
  England-South Africa ODI | England were skittled for 131 at Headingley before
  Aiden Markram took apart the attack – in particular debutant Sonny Baker – in
  a crushing win. Tennis | Carlos Alcaraz moved effortlessly into the
  semi-finals of the US Open with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win against Jiri Lehecka.
  Boxing | Imane Khelif has appealed to the court of arbitration for sport over
  World Boxing’s decision to bar the 26-year-old from its events without a
  preliminary genetic sex test. The front pages The Guardian leads with
  “Europe’s response to Gaza has been a failure, says Spanish PM”. The i paper
  offers “Starmer plans ID cards for all to help stop UK boat migrants”. That’s
  one of the things getting the Mail exercised as it asks “When did Britain
  become North Korea?” – somehow it makes Angela Rayner’s fashion sense one of
  the indicators. The Telegraph is more favourable towards the PM with “Starmer
  attacks Met over trans tweet arrest”. Here’s the Metro to explain further:
  “Father Ted creator’s fury at arrest”. Arresting news of another kind in the
  Financial Times: “Reeves’ leeway shrinks as pound falls and borrowing costs
  hit 27-year high”. The other Times similarly has “Reeves sees borrowing costs
  reach 27-year high”. Top story in the Express is “‘100,000 lives at risk’ in
  cancer care lottery” and the Mirror reports “Brit drug mule’s plea deal … Pay
  up to go free”. Today in Focus Can the Green party’s new leader galvanise the
  left? How does Zack Polanski plan to get people talking about the Green party?
  Peter Walker reports Cartoon of the day | Ella Baron The Upside A bit of good
  news to remind you that the world’s not all bad A quick three-minute brainwave
  test could spot memory problems linked to Alzheimer’s long before diagnosis.
  In a small trial, it identified people with mild cognitive impairment who were
  more likely to develop the disease. Bigger trials are under way, but if
  confirmed, doctors could use it to work out who might benefit most from new
  Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab. Called the Fastball test,
  it uses EEG sensors on the scalp to track brain responses as people watch
  images on a screen. The test picks up memory issues without patients even
  realising they are being tested. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The
  Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work? And finally, the Guardian’s
  puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day. Until tomorrow.
