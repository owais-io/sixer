  to hold it together when the plan falls apart. Torchfire by Moira Buffini,
  Faber, £8.99 In a world divided by attitudes to songlight (or telepathy),
  tensions between the Aylish, who accept it, and the Brightlanders, who
  abominate it, have never been higher. Now the Teroans have entered the fray,
  telepaths (Torches) who hold ordinary humans in contempt. Who will win control
  of humanity’s future – those with songlight, or without? Buffini continues to
  enthral in the second volume of her hugely ambitious dystopian YA trilogy,
  interweaving multiple perspectives with effortless assurance and unforgettable
  impact.
