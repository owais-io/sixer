  Robert Jenrick has called for asylum seekers to be detained in “camps” with
  facilities like “rudimentary prisons”, in an apparent attempt to outflank
  Reform with his anti-immigration rhetoric. The shadow justice secretary told
  Tim Shipman at the Spectator of his hope for a “decade of net emigration” as
  Britain “now needs breathing space after this period of mad migration”.
  Jenrick said “there’s a lot to welcome” in Nigel Farage’s immigration plan but
  criticised Reform for its proposals on housing asylum seekers. “They should be
  detained in camps,” Jenrick said. “The facilities will need to be rudimentary
  prisons, not holiday camps. It’s not what Reform have suggested, which is
  cabins with a fence around them.” He also attacked Reform for indicating that
  their measures would focus on deporting undocumented males rather than women
  and children. Farage rolled back on his initial pledge to deport “absolutely
  anyone” 24 hours after he unveiled his immigration measures last week. Jenrick
  appeared to suggest the Conservative party should outflank Farage on
  immigration as he criticised the policy. “The people-smuggling gangs would
  exploit women and girls, and it would encourage even more young men to pose as
  15-, 16-, 17-year-olds,” he said. Asked about a “moment of radicalisation”, he
  reflected on his visit to a protest outside the Bell hotel in Epping. “I met a
  single mum who had three teenage daughters,” he said. “The oldest daughter,
  who was about to go to university, had bought some workmen’s boots and put
  them outside because she wanted the illegal migrants to think there was a man
  in the house.” Jenrick said another turning point had been a visit to Dover
  with the former MP Natalie Elphicke, where he described migrants walking
  straight into residents’ gardens and kitchens to steal food, a moment he said
  convinced him Westminster was “totally out of touch”. “Damaging though illegal
  migration is, legal migration is even more harmful to the country because of
  the sheer eye-watering numbers of people who have been coming across in recent
  years perfectly legally – it’s putting immense pressure on public services,”
  he said. Jenrick added: “I think the country now needs breathing space after
  this period of mass migration. The age of being open to the world and his wife
  who are low-wage, low-skilled individuals and their dependents has come to an
  end. “Reversing recent low-skilled migration will likely mean a sustained
  period of net emigration. I would support that.” He said Britain was a net
  emigration country in the 1960s to 1980s, and more than half a million people
  left the UK last year. The goal, he argued, was not to “close the border
  entirely” but to stay open to “coders, doctors and serial entrepreneurs”.
  Jenrick, still widely seen as promoting himself for a future leadership
  contest, denied trying to steal Kemi Badenoch’s thunder. “I fully support
  Kemi’s approach which is to develop serious policies with detailed substantive
  basis behind them. That’s the way we can begin to rebuild public trust,” he
  said. But his intervention comes before Tory party conference where Badenoch
  is expected to set out her own immigration plan. Jenrick did not shy away from
  criticising his shadow cabinet colleague Priti Patel. During the interview, he
  said the points-based system created by Conservative ministers “was the worst
  policy mistake in my lifetime”. The system came in when Patel was home
  secretary during Boris Johnson’s time as prime minister.
