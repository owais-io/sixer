  Donald Trump’s much-hyped summit in Alaska with Vladimir Putin ended on Friday
  after just a few hours with few details given about what they discussed and no
  agreement to end the war in Ukraine, despite warm words between the two
  leaders. Six key takeaways from the meeting: The summit produced slim pickings
  … in other words, no deal As Donald Trump conceded during his brief press
  conference with Vladimir Putin, “understanding” and “progress” are oceans
  apart from an agreement. At the end of a summit more notable for its
  choreography than its substance – frustrated reporters were not permitted to
  ask questions – the leaders failed to negotiate even a pause in fighting, let
  alone a ceasefire. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump conceded,
  while Putin described their talks only as a “reference point” for ending the
  conflict and, significantly, a potential launchpad for better diplomatic and
  economic ties between Washington and Moscow. This was a PR victory for a
  dominant Putin Putin may have been the guest at a meeting held on US
  territory, but the Russian leader gained far more cachet than his host. Putin
  spoke to reporters first – a break with convention that gave him the
  opportunity to set the tone of a brief and, at times, quixotic press
  conference in Anchorage. Clearly mindful of his surroundings, Putin, who had
  hitched a ride from to the venue in “the beast” – the secure US presidential
  limousine – reminded the world that the US and Russia were, in fact,
  geographical neighbours, although he stopped short of mentioning that Alaska
  had once been a Russian colony. Trump was effusive in his praise for the
  Russian leader, repeatedly thanking him for his time and later, in an
  interview with Sean Hannity on Fox, awarding a “10” for the Anchorage summit
  because “it’s good when two big powers get along”. As if to underline his
  dominant role in proceedings, Putin ended the briefing by suggesting that
  their next meeting be held in Moscow – an invitation that slightly wrongfooted
  Trump, who had to admit that it would generate “a little heat” at home. But he
  did not rule it out. Putin is still talking about ‘root causes’ that stand in
  the way of a breakthrough That is code for his non-negotiable demand that
  Russia retain the eastern Ukrainian regions it has captured during the
  three-and-a-half-year war, as well as other Kremlin “red lines”: no Ukrainian
  membership of Nato and the European Union, and an end to Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
  presidency. In a message to Keir Starmer and other regional leaders who made a
  public show of support for Zelenskyy on the eve of the summit, Putin warned
  “European capitals” against “creating obstacles” to peace in Ukraine. “I have
  said more than once that for Russia, the events in Ukraine are associated with
  fundamental threats to our national security,” he said. Trump appears to have
  more in common with Putin than with Zelenskyy The summit was notable for the
  absence of the man who leads the country whose fate now lies in the hands of
  Trump and an alleged war criminal. The contrast between the public ambushing
  of Zelenskyy by Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office in February and the
  personal connection – some might even call it warmth – on show in Anchorage
  was hard to ignore. Kyiv could perhaps take solace in the fact that Trump did
  not appear to have accepted all of Putin’s demands, but the summit did little
  to reassure Ukraine that it can, in Zelenskyy’s words, continue to “count on
  America”. As he ended his comments to the media, Trump, almost as an
  afterthought, said he would call the Ukrainian leader “very soon”, along with
  Nato leaders. Trump couldn’t resist revisiting domestic political grievances
  Trump is not a man to let go of the long list of resentments he harbours
  towards his political opponents at home; not surprisingly, he used a summit
  called in an attempt end the bloodiest war in Europe for eight decades as a
  platform to revisit some of those grievances. Perhaps encouraged by Putin –
  who revealed he had told Trump he agreed with the US president’s contention
  that the Ukraine war would not have started had he, and not Joe Biden, been in
  the White House when Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 –
  Trump repeatedly referenced “hoax” claims, backed by US intelligence, that
  Russia had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election. In his interview
  with Hannity, he also claimed that Putin had told him that the 2020 US
  presidential election “was rigged” through the widespread use of postal
  voting. The fighting in Ukraine will continue The Ukraine war raged on even as
  Trump and Putin sat in a room in front of a screen proclaiming that they were
  “Pursuing Peace”. As preparations were made for their first face-to-face
  meeting since 2019, there were no signs that Russian forces were preparing for
  a possible ceasefire, with reports that small sabotage groups had pierced
  Ukrainian defences in the eastern Donbas. Zelenskyy also warned that Russia
  was planning new offensives on three parts of the frontline. On the day of the
  summit Ukrainian military intelligence claimed that Russia was preparing to
  conduct tests of a new nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missile that,
  if successful, would be used to bolster its negotiating position with the US
  and European countries. As the two leaders met, most eastern Ukrainian regions
  were under air raid alerts, while the governors of Russia’s Rostov and Bryansk
  regions reported that some of their territories were under attack from
  Ukrainian drones. The continued fighting was proof that Putin had never been
  interested in negotiating a ceasefire, the Ukrainian opposition lawmaker
  Oleksiy Honcharenko said on Telegram: “It seems Putin has bought himself more
  time. No ceasefire or de-escalation has been agreed upon.”
