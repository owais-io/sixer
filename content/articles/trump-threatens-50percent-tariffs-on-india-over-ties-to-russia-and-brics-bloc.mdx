  The White House is placing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India,
  bringing total tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation for the country’s purchase of
  oil from Russia, according to an executive order signed on Wednesday morning.
  India has 21 days to respond to the potential tariffs before they go into
  effect. The tariffs will be tacked on to a 25% tariff on India Donald Trump
  set last week as a “penalty” for the country’s trading relationship with
  Russia. Last week, the president wrote on social media that India had “always
  bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are
  Russia’s largest buyer of energy”. “I don’t care what India does with Russia.
  They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he wrote.
  Trump had signaled on Tuesday that he would imminently announce new tariffs,
  telling CNBC that the country was “fueling the war machine” against Ukraine.
  India has said that it feels unjustly singled out for its trade relationship
  with Russia. In a statement on Wednesday, the country’s ministry of external
  affairs said that its imports “are based on market factors and done with the
  overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people in
  India”. “We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and
  unreasonable. India will take all actions necessary to protect its national
  interest,” the statement read. Previous trade talks between India and the
  United States collapsed over disagreements about opening up India’s vast
  agriculture and dairy sectors. On Thursday, India’s prime minister, Narendra
  Modi, said he would not compromise the interests of the country’s farmers even
  if he had to pay a heavy price for it, in his first comments since the threat
  of higher tariffs. Modi did not directly refer to the US tariffs or trade
  talks. Trump has also been critical of India’s role in the Brics trading bloc
  formed among some of the US’s trading partners and competitors, including
  Brazil, Russia, China and India. Trump has called the group “anti the United
  States”. In 2024, Indian imports into the US were estimated to be worth $129bn
  (£97bn). India now faces the highest tariff rate along with Brazil, which also
  has 50% tariffs in response to the country’s arrest of its former president
  Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. A slate of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set
  to go into effect this Friday, including the 50% tariff on Brazil, a 35%
  tariff on Canada and a 25% tariff on Mexico. In recent weeks, Trump has set
  his sights on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he had said he would end
  in his first 24 hours in office. Trump set a 10-day deadline for this Friday
  for Russia to make a peace deal with Ukraine. The US special envoy Steve
  Witkoff visited Moscow on Wednesday to hold talks with the Kremlin. Trump
  claimed “great progress was made” during the three-hour talks. When Trump was
  asked on Sunday what would happen if Russia does not end the war by his Friday
  deadline, he said: “Well, there will be sanctions, but they seem to be pretty
  good at avoiding sanctions.”
