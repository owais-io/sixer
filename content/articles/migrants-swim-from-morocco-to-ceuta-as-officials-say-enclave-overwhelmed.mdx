  About 100 people, including several children, risked their lives by trying to
  swim from Morocco into Spain’s north African enclave of Ceuta early on
  Saturday morning, as the territory’s authorities warned that its overwhelmed
  reception system was close to collapse. Recent weeks have seen a rise in the
  number of people trying to reach Ceuta, with more than 50 children swimming
  across from Morocco on 26 July alone. In the latest attempt, on Saturday
  morning, dozens of people were intercepted as they attempted to enter the
  enclave. Seven children reached the shore, where they were handed over to the
  regional authorities. “About 100 people tried to get in, taking advantage of
  the foggy conditions, which make it hard to spot people,” said a spokesperson
  for the Spanish central government’s delegation in Ceuta. “But they didn’t
  manage to do so because the Moroccan security forces and [Spain’s] Guardia
  Civil, working together with rescue boats, prevented them from getting to
  Ceuta.” However, he confirmed the arrival of the seven children. Usually
  people need to swim out from the Moroccan coast, into the treacherous currents
  of the strait of Gibraltar, to make their way to and around the long border
  fences that jut out into the sea, cordoning off the Ceuta enclave from
  Moroccan territory. The swimming migrants can be easy to pick up when there
  are just a few – so people try to go in large numbers in fog or at night-time.
  Those who are intercepted are returned to Morocco. Last month, Juan Jesús
  Rivas, the conservative president of the autonomous city, said Ceuta was
  “totally overwhelmed” by the number of young migrants it was hosting, and
  called for other Spanish regions to take in some of the children. “We’re a
  territory that comprises 20 square kilometres of the 500,000 square kilometres
  that make up the whole of Spain, but we take in 3% of the minors,” Rivas told
  El País. “Who doesn’t get that this is an unsustainable situation? The
  situation in Ceuta is one of collapse and that poses a very serious risk when
  it comes to looking after minors and to the city as a whole.” At the end of
  July, Alberto Gaitán, the Ceuta government’s spokesman, said the enclave was
  hosting 528 foreign minors when it was officially able to hold only 27. Gaitán
  pointed out that contingency plans were already in place to send the children
  to other Spanish regions. “Between 2021 and 2024, around 450 minors – to whom
  we should add another 80 because of family regrouping in different parts of
  Spain – were relocated to other self-governing regions,” he said. “That shows
  that other regions, whatever their political hue, are there to help and have
  shown they can help relieve Ceuta.” Four months ago, Spanish MPs approved a
  decree to redistribute the 4,400 foreign minors in the Canary islands, Ceuta
  and Spain’s other north African enclave of Melilla, across other regions. The
  decree, put forward by the socialist-led government and its parliamentary
  allies, was criticised by the conservative People’s Party (PP), as “arbitrary
  and unfair”. The far-right Vox party also voted against it, saying it opened
  “the doors to military-age men who aren’t fleeing any wars and who come from
  opposing cultures”. In July, PP-led regions boycotted a meeting on the
  redistribution of the children. . According to the UN’s International
  Organization for Migration, 572 people died or went missing last year trying
  to reach Spain from north Africa, while 155 people have lost their lives so
  far this year, seven of them children. A 23-year-old Egyptian man was pulled
  from the Mediterranean a few weeks ago after trying to reach Spain from
  Morocco using an inflatable ring and flippers. In 2021, a boy was seen
  floating on empty plastic bottles in his attempt to reach Ceuta.
