  Three years ago, New Zealanders would have it found it almost impossible to
  imagine the country’s sky-high house prices falling. The market was deemed one
  of the least affordable in the world, with house prices nearly nine times the
  average income and supply dismally low. Desperate first home buyers were being
  squeezed out of the market by cashed-up investors. Some of those in low paid
  or no work were thrust into homelessness and waitlists for social housing
  ballooned. In mid-2021 the crisis reached fever pitch, with the national
  average house price exceeding NZ$1m. But now, those prices are trending
  downwards. According to government-owned property valuer QV, national averages
  have fallen 13% since 2021, while Auckland has dropped nearly 20% and
  Wellington 30% - prompting questions about whether New Zealand has finally
  managed to turn around its housing crisis, and what it could mean for other
  overheated markets around the world. What led to New Zealand’s overheated
  market? In the decades leading up to the pandemic, home ownership became an
  increasingly distant hope for many New Zealanders. Urban planning regulations
  had stymied housing development, public housing was being sold off and the
  population was rapidly growing, putting pressure on the limited housing
  supply. Incomes did not increase at the same rate as house prices and the
  country’s tax and lending systems favoured investors and homeowners, making it
  harder for first home buyers to enter the market. New Zealand’s housing crisis
  worsened dramatically during the pandemic. “Covid kicked things into a whole
  other gear,” says Brad Olsen, an economist and the chief executive at
  Infometrics. “To try and stimulate the economy, we dropped interest rates to
  absolute record lows, and that worked incredibly well – so well that it saw
  house prices at one point up 20-30% on where they were a year before at a
  national level.” When house prices rise, investors “become very active,” says
  Andrea Rush, the national spokesperson for valuer QV. “Everyone gets on the
  bandwagon.” Meanwhile, high immigration during that period increased pressure
  on the market. “We had over 100,000 net gains of migrants and New Zealanders
  each year at that time, all needing somewhere to live,” Rush said. Why are
  house prices now falling? Now, the tide is turning. QV’s latest quarterly
  figures show national averages have dropped by 13.1% since the January 2022
  peak, bringing the new average house price to just over $900,000. Multiple
  factors are driving the downward trend, Rush said. The incredibly low
  pandemic-era interest rates had increased from roughly 2% to as high as 7-8%
  in recent years, making borrowing “incredibly difficult”. High unemployment in
  New Zealand, and record numbers of New Zealanders moving overseas has also
  reshaped the landscape, Rush said. Meanwhile, policies to promote
  intensification are starting to bear fruit, says Dr Michael Rehm, a senior
  lecturer in property at the University of Auckland. “At all levels of
  government, they want to promote housing supply,” Rehm said, adding that as
  demand slows and supply increases, the perception that housing is a safe
  investment has slipped. “Buyers and sellers are starting to get this
  impression that house prices in New Zealand do not always go up, and we’re
  finally breaking down that long-held belief.” Is this the end for New
  Zealand’s housing crisis? For those who bought at the height of the market,
  the drop in values may be a bitter pill to swallow but it will be welcome news
  to first home buyers and to renters, experiencing cheaper rents. So is the
  housing crisis over? Experts have offered a resounding “no”. The housing
  market could only be viewed as affordable if compared with “the Mount Everest
  of house prices”, Olsen said. Around 40% of the average household income is
  spent on mortgages – more affordable than the peak years at about 47% but not
  affordable overall. Rehm said fixing the crisis would require getting house
  prices more in step with household incomes. “But we are so out of whack
  still.” Meanwhile, interest rates are higher than during the peak. Paying back
  a mortgage at 6% or 5.5% interest, as opposed to a 2% during the pandemic, may
  make housing more expensive, Rush says. Prime minister Christopher Luxon told
  RNZ this week he hoped to see modest price increases. His housing minister,
  Christopher Bishop, however, wants to see them fall. “House prices outright
  falling would actually be advantageous,” Olsen said, adding that decoupling
  investment and housing is a good thing. That will be difficult, because many
  people have their wealth tied up in a house, Olsen said. “But over time, we’ve
  seen the sort of social ills and social challenges that have been created by
  having an overly hot and too expensive housing market.” What does it mean for
  other markets? New Zealand has long been watched as a canary in the coal mine
  for the world’s property markets. It is not the only country to experience a
  major reversal in house prices. Canadian prices have slumped by C$150,000
  since 2022, leaving the median Canadian home nearly 20% cheaper. Australia
  meanwhile is yet to experience a crash and will be “looking at what’s
  happening here closely”, Rehm said. Like New Zealand, Australia does not have
  many institutional investors in the market. “It’s a lot of ma and pa investors
  … they’re all banking on the fact that [housing] is going to increase in
  price, and if it doesn’t, then that’s a huge problem.” Olsen said Australia
  might be looking at New Zealand’s slowing market with envy, as they watch
  their own prices continue to rise. “If I was looking at other countries like
  Australia, I don’t know if I could say: ‘you know what, things look like
  they’re getting into a better place’. They’re just continuing to get more and
  more unaffordable.”
