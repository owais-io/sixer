  Director Spike Lee’s multi-part documentary series for ESPN Films about the
  former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sparked a national debate when he
  protested against racial injustice nearly a decade ago, will not be released,
  the film-maker and ESPN said. “ESPN, Colin Kaepernick and Spike Lee have
  collectively decided to no longer proceed with this project as a result of
  certain creative differences,” ESPN said in a statement to Reuters on
  Saturday. “Despite not reaching finality, we appreciate all the hard work and
  collaboration that went into this film.” Lee told Reuters on Friday that the
  series was not going to be released. “It’s not coming out. That’s all I can
  say,” Lee said on the red carpet ahead of the Harold and Carole Pump
  Foundation dinner, a fundraiser for cancer research and treatment, in Beverly
  Hills, California. Asked why, the Oscar-winning director declined to
  elaborate, citing a nondisclosure agreement. “I can’t. I signed a
  nondisclosure. I can’t talk about it.” Kaepernick ignited a national debate in
  2016 when he knelt during the US national anthem to protest against systemic
  racism and police brutality. The 37-year-old has not played in the NFL since
  that season. Many experts believed his political activism, which triggered a
  movement that drew the ire of Donald Trump, was the key reason teams were wary
  of signing him. He later filed a collusion grievance against team owners,
  which was settled with the league in 2019. Representatives for Kaepernick did
  not immediately respond to a request for comment. Production on the series
  began in 2022, with Walt Disney-owned ESPN touting it as a “full, first-person
  account” of Kaepernick’s journey that would feature extensive interviews with
  the player. Last year, Puck News reported the project faced delays amid
  disagreements between Kaepernick and Lee over the direction of the film. The
  series is co-produced by Jemele Hill, a former ESPN reporter who was suspended
  by the network in 2017, after she suggested that fans who disagreed with
  criticism of NFL players taking a knee from the owner of the Dallas Cowboys
  should boycott the team’s advertisers. A month earlier, she had enraged the
  White House when she tweeted: “Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has
  largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.” The network’s
  decision to drop the series comes as the Trump administration has sued
  broadcasters that reported critically on the president and pushed private
  businesses and schools to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that
  the government now defines as unlawful discrimination against white Americans.
  In December, Disney’s ABC News agreed to pay $15m to a foundation and museum
  to be established by Trump as part of a settlement in a defamation lawsuit
  Trump filed against the network.
