  Brittany Groth, the wife of the Victorian Liberals deputy leader, Sam Groth,
  has defended the timing of her relationship with her former tennis star
  husband as the pair threaten legal action against News Corp and a Labor
  minister. On Wednesday, the couple’s legal firm sent a defamations concerns
  notice to the Herald Sun, alleging two articles and social media posts by the
  publication were both a serious invasion of Brittany’s privacy and harmful to
  Sam’s reputation. The articles – which were condemned by the premier, Jacinta
  Allan, and the opposition leader, Brad Battin – claimed unnamed Liberal
  colleagues raised concerns over when the couple’s relationship began, as they
  feared the issue could be weaponised by their political opponents. But in a
  statement distributed by the pair’s legal team on Thursday, Brittany said the
  timeline suggested by the Herald Sun report was “baseless and false”. She said
  she was in a “relationship with someone else” when she first met Sam in
  September 2011, that he was not her tennis coach and he resumed his
  professional tennis career a month later, in mid-November 2011. “We did not
  engage in any conduct that would even arguably fall within the provisions
  quoted by the Herald Sun,” Brittany said. She said she never imagined she
  would be “forced to defend myself or my family against outrageous insinuations
  and a public dissection of my private life by a newspaper”. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email “The Herald Sun’s decision to speculate salaciously about
  my personal life from 14 years ago, when I was a teenager, is not journalism.
  It is a disgraceful smear campaign, devoid of fact, public interest or even
  basic decency,” Brittany said. She alleged the Herald Sun “never once”
  attempted to contact her, deliberately published “clickable” photos and
  allowed the publication on their platforms of “hundreds of vile and defamatory
  comments” by members of the public about her family. “You have now hidden
  them, but only after the damage was already done,” Brittany said. She alleged
  the publication’s conduct “has amounted to pressure on me to disclose intimate
  details of my personal and private life, including when I first had sex with
  my husband, to defend myself against fiction.” The legal letter to the Herald
  Sun demanded all the articles and posts be removed permanently by 5pm on
  Wednesday and the paper publish an apology. But the Herald Sun refused and
  published another report, claiming the Groths were attempting to “shut down
  discussion” on a matter of public interest. Editor Sam Weir was quoted in the
  Herald Sun: “We stand by our reporting on a matter of public interest,
  covering important issues which could have a major impact on Victorian
  politics in the lead-up to an election.” Brittany, however, disputed that her
  “teenage private life” was in the public interest. “There is no excuse for
  using the democratic process as a shield for harassment. There is no
  justification for attacking a woman’s integrity, let alone her children, in
  the pursuit of gossip,” she said. “I am the only person who owns my story. And
  I will not sit back while my family is dehumanised for headlines.” The
  couple’s lawyers have also written to the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas,
  asking her to publicly apologise for comments she made outside parliament on
  Tuesday about when the pair’s relationship had begun. The letter accuses her
  of making comments that were both defamatory and “highly inappropriate”. “They
  appear to have been made by you without any personal knowledge or
  understanding of the background facts about Mr and Mrs Groth’s relationship,
  without you having taken any steps to approach Mr Groth or his wife to discuss
  the situation with them,” the letter from Patrick George claimed. Thomas has
  been contacted for comment. The premier told reporters Thomas was “asked a
  more general question” and noted the reporting was the result of “deep
  division within the Victorian Liberal party”. “I reiterate my view that
  families should very much be off limits,” Allan said.
