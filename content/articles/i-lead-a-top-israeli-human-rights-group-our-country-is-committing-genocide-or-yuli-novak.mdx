  The question keeps gnawing at me: Could this really be it? Could we be living
  through a genocide? Outside Israel, millions already know the answer. But many
  of us here can’t – or won’t – say it aloud. Perhaps because the truth
  threatens to unmake everything we believed about who we are, and who we wanted
  to be. To name it is to admit that the future will require reckoning – not
  just with our leaders, but with ourselves. But the cost of refusing to see is
  even higher. For Israelis of my generation, the word “genocide” was supposed
  to remain a nightmare from another planet. A word tethered to our
  grandparents’ photographs and the ghosts of European ghettoes, not to our own
  neighborhoods. We were the ones who asked, from a distance, about others: how
  could ordinary people go on with their lives while something like this
  happened? How could they let it happen? What would I have done in their place?
  In a grotesque twist of history, that question now circles back to us. For
  nearly two years, we’ve heard Israeli officials – politicians and generals
  alike – say out loud what they intend to do: to starve, flatten and erase
  Gaza. “We will eliminate them.” “We will make it uninhabitable.” “We will cut
  off food, water, electricity.” These weren’t slips of the tongue; they were
  the plan. And then, the Israeli military carried it out. By the textbook
  definition, this is genocide: the deliberate targeting of a population not for
  who they are as individuals, but because they belong to a group – an attack
  designed to destroy the group itself. We told ourselves other stories to
  survive the horror, stories that kept guilt and grief at bay. We convinced
  ourselves that every child in Gaza was Hamas, every apartment a terrorist
  cell. We became, without noticing, those “ordinary people” who keep living
  their lives while “it” is happening. I can still recall the first time reality
  cracked open for me. Two months into what I was still calling a “war”, three
  of my B’Tselem colleagues – Palestinian human rights workers we’d worked
  alongside for years – were trapped in Gaza with their families. They told me
  about relatives buried under rubble, about not being able to shield their
  children, about the paralyzing fear. In the frantic efforts to extract them
  from Gaza, I learned something that has seared itself into my mind: at that
  moment, a living Palestinian in Gaza could be “ransomed” for roughly 20,000
  shekels. Children cost less. Life priced in cash, per head. These were not
  abstract statistics; these were people I knew. And that was when I understood:
  the rules had changed. Since then, the surreal has become routine. Cities
  reduced to ash. Entire neighborhoods flattened. Families displaced, then
  displaced again. Tens of thousands killed. Mass starvation engineered, with
  aid trucks turned away or bombed. Parents feeding animal fodder to their
  children, some of whom die waiting for flour. Others are shot – unarmed
  civilians, gunned down for approaching food convoys. Genocide does not happen
  without mass participation: a population that supports it, enables it or looks
  away. That is part of its tragedy. Almost no nation that has committed
  genocide understood, in real time, what it was doing. The story is always the
  same: self-defense, inevitability, the targets brought it on themselves. In
  Israel, the prevailing narrative insists this all began on 7 October, with
  Hamas’s massacre of civilians in southern Israel. That day was a true horror,
  a grotesque burst of human cruelty: civilians slaughtered, raped, taken
  hostage. A concentrated national trauma that summoned, for many Israelis, a
  profound sense of existential threat. But 7 October, while catalytic, was not
  enough on its own. Genocide requires conditions – decades of apartheid and
  occupation, of separation and dehumanization, of policies designed to sever
  our capacity for empathy. Gaza, sealed off from the world, became the apex of
  this architecture. Its people became abstractions, perpetual hostages in our
  imagination, subjects to bomb every few years, to kill by the hundreds or
  thousands, with no accountability. We knew more than 2 million people were
  living under siege. We knew about Hamas. We knew about the tunnels. In
  hindsight, we knew everything. Yet somehow we were incapable of understanding
  that some of them might find a way to break out. What happened on 7 October
  was not only a military failure. It was a collapse of our social imagination:
  the delusion that we could corral all the violence and despair behind a fence
  and live peacefully on our side. That rupture arrived under the most extreme
  rightwing government in Israel’s history, a coalition whose ministers openly
  fantasize about Gaza’s erasure. And so, in October 2023, every star in our
  darkest nightmare aligned. This week, B’Tselem released a report, Our
  Genocide, compiled by Palestinian and Jewish-Israeli researchers together. It
  is divided into two parts. The first documents how this genocide is being
  carried out: mass killings, destruction of living conditions, social collapse
  and engineered starvation, all fueled by incitement from Israeli leaders and
  amplified through media. The second part of the report traces the path that
  led here: decades of systemic inequality, military rule and policies of
  separation that normalized Palestinian disposability. To confront genocide, we
  must first understand it. And in order to do so, we – Jewish-Israelis and
  Palestinians – had to look at reality together, through the perspective of the
  human beings living on this land. Our moral and human obligation is to amplify
  the voices of the victims. Our political and historical responsibility is also
  to turn our gaze to the perpetrators, and to testify, in real time, to how a
  society transforms into one capable of committing genocide. Recognizing this
  truth is not easy. Even for us, people who have spent years documenting state
  violence against Palestinians, the mind resists it. It rejects the facts like
  poison, tries to spit them out. But the poison is here. It floods the bodies
  of those who live between the river and the sea – Palestinians and Israelis
  alike – with fear and unfathomable loss. The Israeli state is committing
  genocide. And once you accept that, the question we have asked ourselves all
  our lives rematerializes with urgency: what would I have done, back then, on
  that other planet? Except the answer is not rhetorical. It is now. It is us.
  And there is only one right answer: We must do everything in our power to stop
  it. Yuli Novak is the executive director of B’Tselem, the Israeli Information
  Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories
