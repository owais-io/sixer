  The Victorian opposition leader, Brad Battin, has defended taking a detour on
  his way to work to hold an impromptu press conference at the scene of a fatal
  stabbing in Melbourne’s south-east, saying he will continue to visit active
  crime scenes. Emergency services were called to a petrol station on the corner
  of Potter Street and Princes Highway at Dandenong about 4.50am on Tuesday in
  response to reports a man had been stabbed. The man, 39, was treated by
  paramedics but died at the scene. Battin told reporters he heard reports of
  the stabbing on the radio and decided to make a detour on his way to
  parliament. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I was coming into work this
  morning, I heard it on the radio. It is an area that I was a Victoria police
  officer, and I have seen these crimes in these areas in the past,” he said. “I
  then went there and spoke to the media. But the message was quite simple, the
  crime is out of control in the state.” Battin said he “did a press conference
  with the cameras” and spoke with police at the scene. He said he was unaware
  at the time that the victim’s body was still at the scene and his next of kin
  were yet to be contacted. Victorian government minister Colin Brooks said it
  was “appalling” that Battin stopped at the scene. “[The] government
  acknowledges the impacts of crime, particularly knife crime, is unacceptable,”
  Brooks told reporters. “But what we don’t need is politicians heading out to
  crime scenes, particularly if … family members haven’t been notified. That’s
  appalling behaviour from someone who aspires to be leader.” Brooks said while
  the opposition leader was “entitled to make political arguments” and
  “criticise the government” it was a “real error of judgment” to attend the
  scene. “He should apologise to the families,” Brooks said. But Battin said he
  had no regrets about the press conference and would not apologise. “If I’m out
  and about and there’s a crime scene and I pop past I will be making sure that
  people know what is going on in the state. I will continue to do that. I’ll
  continue to be the voice for Victoria police,” he said. “For a minister to be
  more worried about me than they are worried about the fact that we’ve had
  people stabbed in the streets here in Victoria … that’s a disgrace.” Det Insp
  Dean Thomas from the Victoria police homicide squad said the exact
  circumstances surrounding the man’s death were yet to be established. They
  were also yet to formally identify the man. He said it appeared he may have
  suffered stab wounds at a property nearby and urged anyone who saw anything
  suspicious in the vicinity of the area between 4.30am and 5am to contact Crime
  Stoppers. “It appears to be targeted but we’re still trying to understand what
  has gone on, and that’s why the appeal to anybody that may have been in the
  area at the time, that may have seen anything that looks suspicious – may have
  seen any people walking along, any vehicles that look suspicious – that they
  share that with us as soon as they can,” Thomas said. He refused to comment
  when asked whether it was appropriate for Battin to be at an active crime
  scene. “I’m not aware of what Mr Battin had to say. He’s entitled to say …
  whatever he would like to say, but I don’t know what was said,” Thomas said.
