  My friend Raymond Warren, who has died aged 96, was a composer of classical
  music who taught at Queen’s University Belfast and then the University of
  Bristol. Many of Raymond’s pieces were concerned with Christian responses to
  suffering, but he also wrote music for children and young people. A late
  success was his charming score for Ballet Shoes, written for the London
  Children’s Ballet, which was performed at the Peacock theatre in London in
  2001 and revived by that company in 2010 and 2019. Born in Weston-super-Mare,
  Somerset, Raymond was the eldest child of Arthur, a maths teacher and keen
  amateur musician, and Gwendoline (nee Hallett), a shorthand typist. He went to
  Bancroft’s school in Woodford Green, east London, and then studied music at
  Cambridge. After graduating, he began teaching music at Queen’s University
  Belfast in 1955, where he was given a personal chair in composition in 1966,
  before becoming professor of music there in 1969. By then receiving national
  attention for some of his compositions – including The Pity of Love, written
  for Peter Pears and Julian Bream to perform at the 1966 Aldeburgh festival –
  he became resident composer to the Ulster Orchestra and a key figure in the
  Belfast festival at Queen’s (now known as the Belfast international arts
  festival) from its inception in 1962. As the political atmosphere in Northern
  Ireland became increasingly tense, his music became a witness to events: Songs
  of Unity (1968), a work for children that celebrated ecumenism, was picketed
  by Ian Paisley at its premiere, and his powerful Second Symphony (1969)
  reflected the growing sectarian conflict of the time. Collaborations followed
  in 1970 with the choreographer Helen Lewis (There Is a Time, for double choir
  and dancers at the Cork choral festival) and with Seamus Heaney (A Lough Neagh
  Sequence, seven Heaney poems accompanied by Raymond on piano). Heaney also
  made a recording of his poetry with Warren’s music in 2011, shortly before his
  death. Raymond left Belfast in 1972 to take up a position as chair in music at
  the University of Bristol, a post he held until retiring from teaching in
  1994, although he remained active as a composer for many more years. His wife,
  Roberta (nee Smith), a textile artist whom he married in 1953, predeceased him
  in 2022. He is survived by their four children, Tim, Christopher, Ben and
  Clare, and eight grandchildren.
