  Trump’s mass deportation agenda

  Former Superman actor Dean Cain has announced he has signed up to join US
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), in order to support Donald Trump’s
  anti-immigration agenda. The federal law enforcement agency has aggressively
  ramped up immigration raids since Trump’s return to the White House and was
  recently awarded $75bn in extra funding as part of the president’s “big
  beautiful bill”, which includes billions for hiring an additional 10,000 Ice
  agents by 2029. Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday night, Cain told host Jesse
  Watters that he decided to join Ice after sharing one of their recruitment
  videos on his Instagram account on Tuesday, which Watters had spoken about on
  his show. “I’m actually a sworn deputy sheriff and a reserve police officer –
  I wasn’t part of Ice, but once I put that out there and you put a little blurb
  on your show, it went crazy,” Cain told Watters on Wednesday. “So now I’ve
  spoken with some officials over at Ice, and I will be sworn in as an Ice
  agent, ASAP.” Asked what inspired him to join, Cain said: “This country was
  built on patriots stepping up, whether it was popular or not, and doing the
  right thing. I truly believe this is the right thing.” He added: “We have a
  broken immigration system. Congress needs to fix it, but in the interim,
  President Trump ran on this. He is delivering on this. This is what people
  voted for. It’s what I voted for and he’s going to see it through, and I’ll do
  my part and help make sure it happens.” Cain, who played Superman opposite
  Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane in Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman
  in the 1990s, said he hoped others would join him. “I’m stepping up,” he said.
  “Hopefully, a whole bunch of other former officers, former Ice agents, will
  step up and we’ll meet those recruitment goals immediately, and we’ll help
  protect this country.” Ice has been conducting unprecedented immigration raids
  across the US since Trump was re-elected and now aims for 3,000 minimum
  arrests a day. The raids have seen undocumented people, residents with
  protected legal status, and even American citizens pulled off the streets and
  thrown into a deportation system that increasingly does not respect due
  process. Ice’s actions have sparked protests across the US, with the Trump
  administration jailing and prosecuting protesters, as well as civilians who
  film and object to Ice arrests. Cain recently made headlines for calling the
  latest Superman film “woke”, after director James Gunn described the character
  as an immigrant. Cain told TMZ: “How woke is Hollywood going to make this
  character? How much is Disney going to change their Snow White? Why are they
  going to change these characters [to] exist for the times? “We know Superman
  is an immigrant – he’s a freaking alien … The ‘American way’ is immigrant
  friendly, tremendously immigrant friendly,” he added. “But there are rules …
  There have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States.
  We can’t have everybody, society will fail. So there have to be limits.”
