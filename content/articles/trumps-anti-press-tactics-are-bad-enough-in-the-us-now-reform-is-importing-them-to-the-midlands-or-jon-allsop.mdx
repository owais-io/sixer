  On the day that he returned to office in January, Donald Trump signed an order
  renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”. A few days later, the
  Associated Press, a leading global news agency that is also a linguistic bible
  for newsrooms across the US, said that while it would acknowledge Trump’s
  order, it would mostly continue to use the original name. In response, the
  White House banned AP journalists from certain media availabilities. Trump
  accused the agency of failing to follow the law. The AP said the government
  was trying to dictate what words it can and cannot use. This week,
  Nottinghamshire’s Reform-led county council said that it would impose a
  sweeping ban on the Nottingham Post, its affiliated website and BBC-funded
  reporters who work there. At issue, apparently, was a story that the paper had
  written about a proposed reorganisation of local government. The leader of the
  council insisted that he welcomes scrutiny, but has a “duty” to combat
  “misinformation”. The Post’s editor called the decision “a massive attack on
  local democracy” – and it’s hard to disagree. The ban has clear echoes of
  Trump’s tactics, and some critics said as much explicitly. In the US, there is
  a clear longer-term trend of Republican officials imposing poorly justified
  restrictions on the press. But one doesn’t need to look as far as that to
  understand the Nottinghamshire ban. Indeed, Reform has been accused before of
  shutting out reporters, or otherwise treating them with disrespect: last year,
  the party reportedly excluded certain adversarial outlets and journalists from
  its conference; earlier this summer, Reform’s leader Nigel Farage accused
  local reporters in Scotland of helping to coordinate protests against him. It
  all seems to add up, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond, to a moment in
  which hard-right politicians, in particular, feel that they don’t need to
  engage with traditional news outlets to get their message out, and that they
  won’t suffer electoral consequences for shutting them out. They might even
  benefit from doing so, turning the media into a foil as part of a broader war
  against the establishment. And yet, there are also reasons to doubt these
  conclusions, or at least to texture them. It’s true that Trump, for example,
  has shut out journalists whose stories displease him. (In addition to the AP
  imbroglio, his White House recently barred a reporter from the Wall Street
  Journal from a trip to the UK, after that paper reported unflatteringly on
  Trump’s alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein.) At the same time, though, Trump will
  routinely talk to pretty much anyone who will listen, the mainstream media
  very much included. (Earlier this year, he called the editor of the Atlantic a
  “sleazebag” – then granted him an interview not long after.) Indeed, Trump has
  long used media coverage successfully to set the political agenda. In the UK,
  Farage seems to be using the same playbook. Sure, he has leaned, in
  particular, on the rightwing press. But such papers aren’t necessarily natural
  allies for Reform given their deep cultural ties to the Conservatives. And
  Farage has sucked up oxygen in more hostile quarters, too. This week, just as
  Nottinghamshire council was banning journalists, Farage was being praised, by
  Politico, for answering questions about his mass deportation plans with a
  directness that other parties should seek to emulate. Trump has clearly proven
  that there aren’t hard electoral consequences for press-bashing. But there are
  still important differences between UK and US political culture. Trust in the
  media is at a low ebb here, too. But in the recent past, rightwing political
  figures who have used Trumpian rhetoric to deflect blame for their own
  failures on to the media haven’t always been successful. Dominic Cummings
  goaded the press after his Covid-era drive to Barnard Castle, but could not
  escape massive public anger. Boris Johnson dodging tough questions – from the
  Today programme, for example, which his government boycotted – didn’t spare
  him from the glare of scandal in the long run. This doesn’t guarantee that the
  leaders of Nottinghamshire council will suffer from banning their local paper.
  Indeed, it might very well be to Reform’s advantage to let Farage suck up
  attention nationally while dodging scrutiny for the actions of the party’s
  councillors across the country; the party surely wants the media talking about
  immigration, not the reorganisation of local government. And local outlets
  might seem an easy target, diminished in power and reach in an age of cuts to
  local news and unchained online discourse. And yet Reform’s leadership of
  councils is an important test for the party in a country where voters still,
  to some extent, value competent governance. “If Reform can’t even face
  questions from the Nottingham Post,” the Conservative party chair Kevin
  Hollinrake wondered this week, “what hope is there that they could ever face
  the serious responsibilities of government?” He’s surely not the only one
  asking that question. Even in the US, where the culture of political
  press-bashing is more entrenched, local Republican legislators in some states
  are cooperating with proposals to steer more resources to their dwindling
  local news outlets. This isn’t some act of altruism, advocates say, but one
  born of the realisation that they need voters to know what they’ve been doing
  when elections roll around. The Reform ban might hold. But at some point,
  local Reform councillors will want to trumpet an achievement, and when they
  do, it would not be a massive surprise if they go running to the Nottingham
  Post. Politicians can, of course, reach voters on social media these days. But
  established local news brands can still confer prestige. And good publicity is
  good publicity. For now, Trump hasn’t let up on the AP. But he hasn’t been shy
  about showcasing its journalism when it suits him. An artwork based on the
  iconic image of Trump pumping his fist after his attempted assassination last
  year now adorns a White House wall. It was taken by an AP photographer. Jon
