  Health experts have urged Bridget Phillipson to stop schools using educational
  materials funded by the food, drink and gambling industries, in order to
  protect children from “harmful” influences. Dozens of doctors, health
  charities and public health specialists have written to the education
  secretary warning her that such firms are sponsoring resources used in lessons
  with pupils, despite them misrepresenting the evidence about diets, alcohol
  and betting. Some of the materials teach young people how to pour glasses of
  wine, distort the evidence about alcohol’s role in causing cancer, and promote
  “responsible gambling” to them, the letter says. The Obesity Health Alliance,
  British Medical Association, and directors of public health and World Cancer
  Research Fund are among those who have signed the letter. They are alarmed by
  companies gaining “corporate reach” in schools by supplying teacher resource
  packs and student information sheets that they claim constitute “misleading
  and harmful classroom materials”. “We wouldn’t let big tobacco teach children
  about smoking. So why are we allowing the alcohol, gambling and junk food
  industries into classrooms?” said Chris van Tulleken, a professor of
  infectious disease and global health at University College London. “Allowing
  these industries into schools distorts learning and helps industry establish
  the next generation of customers.” The coalition of 58 health experts, groups
  and academics wants Phillipson to adopt the same tough approach as the
  Republic of Ireland. In 2022 its government told schools not to use materials
  in the classroom that had been funded by the alcohol industry or other
  “parties with conflicts of interest”. Academic studies have found that
  “self-claimed prevention education programmes … serve the interests of their
  commercial funders. The materials help to normalise harmful behaviours, omit
  or misrepresent important risks, and shift responsibility for harm on to
  individuals, including children and young people, and away from the industries
  and their practices.” Dr May van Schalkwyk, a research fellow at the
  University of Edinburgh and expert in corporate tactics, said: “The evidence
  is clear. Industries whose products are undermining the health and wellbeing
  of children and young people fund harmful youth education programmes as part
  of their corporate strategies. Urgent action is needed to prevent this form of
  influence and conflicts of interest”. The letter highlights examples of how
  the alcohol, gambling and junk food industries have been gaining influence in
  schools by supplying sponsored resources. It claims that Smashed, a play about
  underage drinking sponsored by drinks firm Diageo used in PSHE lessons,
  contains “cancer misinformation, for instance omitting the most common forms
  of alcohol-related cancer or suggesting alcohol-related cancers are only
  associated with heavy drinking”. The letter also alleges that Gamble Aware, an
  industry-funded charity, has produced “educational materials that promote the
  industry-favoured idea of ‘responsible gambling’. These introduce young people
  to gambling products and may facilitate gambling initiations, for example by
  teaching students how to use a betting slip.” In addition, “in some sixth-form
  colleges, brands like Costa Coffee and Starbucks have set up entire outlets
  that sell items packed with sugar”, the letter adds. Zoe Osmond, Gamble
  Aware’s chief executive, said it commissions “a broad range of independently
  designed and delivered education programmes, which are evaluated using
  transparent criteria by independent researchers. “We only ever commission
  activity aimed to raise awareness of the risks of gambling and direct people
  to appropriate support and treatment. It is inaccurate and irresponsible to
  suggest otherwise.” Drinkaware said it no longer sponsors materials for
  schools. “The education programme referenced in the letter [about how to pour
  drinks] was wound down in 2019, six years ago and three years before the
  academic paper cited was published”, a spokesperson said. Diageo rebutted the
  letter’s description of Smashed, which it said “has successfully educated
  hundreds of thousands of young people on the risks of underage drinking. It is
  disappointing this letter attempts to undermine a proven initiative.
  “Ninety-nine per cent of participating teachers surveyed last year said it was
  important programmes like this are funded to visit schools, and 87% said they
  now feel more confident talking with young people about the dangers of
  underage drinking. “The programme makes clear unambiguous references to
  several risks associated with alcohol including various cancers, and it is
  misleading to suggest otherwise.” Starbucks said that it has opened outlets
  “in a small number of schools and further education facilities”, but in
  schools they are only available to sixth-formers. A Department for Education
  spokesperson said: “Through our plan for change we have already strengthened
  statutory guidance to address these concerns, making it clear that schools
  should check that external resources are unbiased and should guard against
  organisations that have a broader interest in promoting harmful products.
  “Schools are responsible for setting their own policies on these subjects, in
  line with this guidance, and are best placed to decide what materials,
  speakers or organisations to use based on their knowledge of their pupils and
  communities.”
