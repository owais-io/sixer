  Stocks soared on Friday following the strongest signal yet that US the Federal
  Reserve is gearing up to start cutting interest rates again this fall. But how
  long can this celebration last? While Wall Street cheered the biggest headline
  from the speech by the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, at the annual Jackson Hole
  symposium in Wyoming, Powell also delivered a reality check on where interest
  rates could settle in the longer term. “We cannot say for certain where rates
  will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher
  than during the 2010s,” said Powell. In other words: even if the Fed does
  start cutting interest rates again this year, they may not fall back to their
  pre-pandemic levels. It’s a signal, despite the short-term optimism on
  potential rate cuts, that the Fed’s long-term outlook is more unstable.
  “Markets might be ahead of their skis on how aggressive the Fed is going to be
  in reducing interest rates, because the neutral rate might be higher than some
  believe,” Ryan Sweet, an economist at Oxford Economics, said. Higher rates
  means borrowing money for loans, such as mortgages, will be more expensive.
  The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was just under 3% in 2021, when
  interest rates were near zero. Now the average mortgage rate is closer to
  6.7%. Paired with home prices at near-record highs, elevated mortgages mean
  many Americans will continue to struggle to purchase a home. Although Trump
  has been pushing the Fed for months to decrease rates to 1%, claiming that
  Powell is “hurting the housing industry very badly”, it seems unlikely that
  rates will return to such a level any time soon. The Fed is trying to achieve
  a Goldilocks balance. Rates that are too high risk unemployment, while rates
  that are too low could mean higher inflation. Policymakers are searching for a
  “neutral” level, where everything is just right. Many economists believed the
  central bank was close to achieving this balance before Trump started his
  second term. In summer 2022, as inflation scaled its highest levels in a
  generation, the Fed started raising rates, at the risk of hurting the labor
  market, in an attempt to get inflation down to 2%. Rates rose to about 5.3% in
  less than two years, but the jobs market remained strong. Unemployment was
  still at historically low even as inflation came down. Although some
  economists had feared rapidly increasing rates would throw the US economy into
  a recession, instead the Fed appeared to achieve what is known as a “soft
  landing”. But things were thrown into a tailspin when Trump returned to
  office, armed with campaign promises to enact a full-blown trade war against
  the US’s key trading partners. The president has long argued that tariffs
  would boost American manufacturing and set the stage for better trade deals.
  “Tariffs don’t cause inflation. They cause success,” Trump declared back in
  January, acknowledging that there might be “some temporary, short-term
  disruption”. But so far, success has been limited. Economists doubt the
  policies will generate a manufacturing renaissance, and Trump’s trade war has
  inspired new commercial alliances that exclude the US. All the while, US
  consumers are starting to see higher prices due to Trump’s tariffs. At Jackson
  Hole on Friday, Powell said tariffs had started to push some prices up. In
  June and July, inflation was 2.7% – up 0.4 percentage points since April, when
  Trump first announced the bulk of his tariffs. This is still only a modest
  increase in price growth, but the bulk of the White House’s highest tariffs
  only went into effect in early August. Fed policymakers are waiting to see
  whether Trump’s aggressive trade strategy will cause a one-time shift in price
  levels – or if the effects will continue. The once strong labor market has
  grown sluggish. Though there are fewer job openings, there are also fewer
  people looking for jobs. Powell called it “a curious kind of balance” where
  “both the supply of and demand for workers” have slowed. He noted that the
  balance was unstable and could eventually tip over, prompting more layoffs and
  a rise in unemployment. This instability in the labor market has made Fed
  officials more open to a rate cut. Powell pointed to a slacking in consumer
  spending and weaker gross domestic product (GDP), which suggests an overall
  slowdown in economic activity. Although it set the stage for a rate cut as
  soon as next month, Powell’s speech was far from optimistic. “In this
  environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trends, or structural
  developments is difficult,” he said. “Monetary policy can work to stabilise
  cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.” From
  Powell, who is typically diplomatic and reserved in his public statements,
  this seemed to be a careful warning: when executive policies destabilise the
  economy, the Fed can only do so much to limit the damage.
