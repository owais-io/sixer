  While patrolling the Great Barrier Reef, Gary Singleton was struck by an eerie
  stillness. The Coral Sea lay flat as glass beneath a heavy, windless sky. The
  heat was stifling, the water a little too warm. “It was beautiful,” he says.
  “But I remember thinking, ‘I feel sorry for the reef.’” That moment stayed
  with him. A Yirrganydji traditional owner and land and sea manager in the
  Cairns-Port Douglas region, Singleton has spent more than 12 years working to
  protect the reef – as warming seas, sediment runoff, pollution and overfishing
  steadily erode its resilience. Just this week a report found a record drop in
  live coral in two out of three sections of the reef, prompting warnings that a
  tipping point for the ecosystem’s future is approaching. “My biggest fear is
  that we’ll lose everything,” says Singleton, whose father, Gavin Singleton Sr,
  was also a sea ranger. “It’s a big part of our identity. We don’t just think
  of the Great Barrier Reef as coral, we think of it as an entire system. A
  living thing.” As traditional owners like Singleton witness the reef’s decline
  first-hand, some are beginning to ask a deeper question: what if the reef had
  the same legal rights as a person? Around the world, rivers, forests and
  mountains have been recognised as legal entities under a growing legal
  movement known as the “rights of nature”. In the case of the Great Barrier
  Reef, the rights of nature model could recognise the world’s largest coral
  system as a legal person: an entity capable of holding rights and having those
  rights defended in court. “I’ve been quite interested in the concept of
  recognising the reef as its own living entity,” Singleton says. “Like New
  Zealand, with some of the rivers and mountains being given[legal personhood]
  status. “It’s about separating the politics and all that outside noise and
  really giving the reef the respect it deserves as its own entity, its own
  being.” A living legal entity According to Dr Michelle Maloney, a lawyer and
  co-founder of the Australian Earth Laws Alliance, rights of nature laws could
  profoundly improve Australia’s environmental governance system. “Australian
  law, like most western legal systems, treats nature as human property: a
  collection of objects to be used, exploited or protected,” she says. “In
  contrast, Aboriginal legal systems, some of the oldest continuous legal
  systems in the world, have always seen nature as alive. We have a lot to learn
  from Aboriginal law.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads
  Rights of nature encompasses different approaches to trying to extend new
  rights or protections to nature, through granting ecosystems or natural
  objects status as legal persons or living entities. Legal personhood is a
  legal construct that grants legal rights to entities. Living entity is a term
  that recognises something is in fact alive, not just an object, but being
  granted this status doesn’t create a legal right. Maloney believes that
  granting the reef legal personhood could be relatively straightforward, if the
  political will were there. “In theory, the government could pass a law that
  says the Great Barrier Reef is a legal entity and has rights to exist, thrive,
  evolve and continue its vital cycles,” she says “And there are a number of
  different ways such a law could be implemented.” Under one model, guardians –
  including traditional owners and other stakeholders – would be appointed to
  act on the reef’s behalf. “It would mean a process that made sure all of the
  different First Nations people up and down the reef system could be guardians
  for their land and sea country.” she says. Maloney says this systemic change
  isn’t just a tool for symbolism but for action: “Let’s say a container ship
  leaked oil. The reef’s guardians could sue the company for damages on behalf
  of the reef. Guardians could also have a stronger voice in future planning to
  reduce activities that damage the reef.” The legal personhood model appeals to
  Victor Bulma, a Mandingalbay Yidinji man and marine park inspector who lives
  in Yarrabah, just south of Cairns. “I would definitely support it,” he says.
  “It is a great idea to give us some sort of rights and stuff. But yeah, that’d
  be a big hill to climb.” He has witnessed significant changes to the reef over
  his lifetime. But it’s the changes to the coral he finds most alarming. “Back
  when I was younger the reef was very, very colourful,” he says. “It was
  paradise. Global warming plays a big part in the damage of it. Some parts of
  the reef are just grey.” Maloney believes legal personhood could give
  guardians like Bulma greater power to defend the reef from climate change.
  “It’s not just the elephant in the room, it’s the elephant starting to crush
  us all,” she says. “And we have a government that refuses to take it seriously
  and denies any duty of care.” She points to the federal court ruling in the
  Pabai case, which found the government has no duty of care to Torres Strait
  Islanders on climate change, as evidence of the system’s failure. “I’d like to
  think legal personhood would change things for the better. Because if the law
  says its guardians have a right to do all they can to protect the reef, then
  they should be able to force real change.” Internationally, the rights of
  nature movement is gaining momentum. Ecuador became the first country to
  enshrine the rights of nature in its constitution in 2008; since then, dozens
  of successful court cases have been brought on behalf of ecosystems. In
  Australia, Victoria passed legislation in 2017 recognising the Yarra River as
  a living entity, acknowledging its ecological value and cultural significance
  to the Wurundjeri people. While New Zealand’s Whanganui River was granted
  legal personhood as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement, the path is more
  complex in Australia. “There are no treaties between First Nations people and
  the British or Australian governments, and Aboriginal people have fewer
  triggers in the law to insist on their rights,” Maloney says. “That makes it a
  little harder. Not impossible, but harder.” A song in need of protection For
  Singleton, who spends his days restoring coral and seagrass, monitoring marine
  life and planting trees along the coastline, the need to protect the reef is
  undeniable. “The thing is, the reef’s threats are cumulative … you can’t
  single out one thing,” he says. “The entire ecosystem needs protecting. Our
  elders have always seen the reef holistically.” He hopes the concept of legal
  personhood can help reframe public thinking, not just about damage, but about
  responsibility. “As people, we are benefiting from the reef – socially,
  economically and culturally,” he says. “But how does the reef benefit?” This
  year Singleton and Bulma joined a campaign to nominate the Great Barrier Reef
  for a UN lifetime achievement award; the first time a non-human entity has
  been put forward. The honour has previously recognised individuals such as Sir
  David Attenborough. In July the reef received a less celebratory distinction:
  the UN warned it could soon be added to the world heritage “in danger” list,
  citing mounting threats from climate change and pollution. The Australian
  government has until early 2026 to show progress – or risk the reef’s heritage
  status being downgraded. Singleton admits he initially questioned the intent
  behind the UN nomination. “I did hear a comment somewhere about whether this
  was a media stunt,” he says. “But I do think there is some genuine respect in
  there. It would be good to have more people speaking across the whole reef, to
  strengthen that voice.” That voice, he says, has always existed, if only we
  would listen. “In our language, we call the reef Yurrbinji, which means
  ‘song’. I’ve always thought, if the reef had a voice, it would sing.” Bulma
  shares that hope, especially for future generations. “It’s for our kids and
  grandkids. We’ve got to protect the reef, so they can see what we saw and feel
  that same connection.” “We need to put this more on a global level,” he adds.
  “I’ll cross my fingers for that.”
