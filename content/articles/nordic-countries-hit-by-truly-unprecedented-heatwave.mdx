  Cold Nordic countries are being seared by “truly unprecedented” heat, as hot
  weather strengthened and lengthened by carbon pollution continues to roast
  northern Europe. A weather station in the Norwegian part of the Arctic Circle
  recorded temperatures above 30C (86F) on 13 days in July, while Finland has
  had three straight weeks with 30C heat. Scientists say it is the longest
  streak in records going back to 1961, and 50% longer than the previous record.
  “Truly unprecedented heatwave still in full swing with maximum today about
  32-33C,” said Mika Rantanen, a climate scientist at the Finnish Meteorological
  Institute, in a social media post on Thursday. “Even the Arctic regions … have
  seen three weeks above 25C, and may rival tomorrow their August heat records.”
  The Norwegian Meteorological Institute said temperatures above 30C were
  recorded on 12 days in July by at least one station in its three northernmost
  counties. Although the country had a brief respite last week as hot weather
  moved north and east, the institute said it expected temperatures of 30C might
  be reached again over the weekend. “We have some hot days ahead of us in
  northern Norway,” it said. In Sweden, meteorologists said long-term heatwaves
  were noted at several stations in the north of the country, with a weather
  station in Haparanda measuring 25C or more for 14 days in a row. In Jokkmokk,
  Lappland, the heatwave lasted for 15 days. “To find a longer period at these
  stations, you have to go back more than a century,” said Sverker Hellström, a
  scientist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Blistering
  heat swept northern Europe in mid-July, driven by hot waters off the Norwegian
  northern coast and a stubborn area of high pressure that brought temperatures
  in the Nordics 8-10C above seasonal norms. The region has also since been hit
  by storms and lightning strikes that have sparked wildfires. The hot weather
  has taken people by surprise in a part of the continent better adapted to the
  cold. Researchers have found that countries such as the UK, Norway and
  Switzerland will face the greatest relative rise in uncomfortably hot days as
  the planet heats up, and have warned that their infrastructure is not
  well-suited to cope. On Wednesday, an ice rink in northern Finland opened its
  doors to people seeking refuge from the heat after they overfilled the local
  hospital’s emergency room, according to Finnish media. On Thursday, herders
  warned that their reindeer were on the verge of dying in the heat. Swedish
  radio reported that foreign tourists heading north to Scandinavia for
  “coolcations” had instead encountered dangerous heat warnings. “As climate
  change progresses, exceptionally severe heatwaves will intensify,” said Heikki
  Tuomenvirta, a scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. “They are
  occurring more frequently, are more severe and last longer.”
