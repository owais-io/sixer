  West Ham are poised to sign Mateus Fernandes from Southampton for a fee of
  about £38m. Talks progressed swiftly on Wednesday and it is understood the
  21-year-old midfielder has undergone a medical in London. West Ham have been
  hunting for midfield reinforcements and are also poised to finalise personal
  terms with Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa, who will cost €17m (£14.7m) plus €3m
  in add-ons. Graham Potter, who is under pressure after a dreadful start to the
  season, has been looking to make two additions in midfield. He wants a No 6 to
  break up and control play, and a No 8 to add creativity and energy in the
  final third. Magassa, 21, is regarded as the sitting player. The France
  Under-21 international underwent a medical on Wednesday and is poised to sign
  a six-year deal. West Ham had to fend off interest in Magassa from Nottingham
  Forest, who wanted to loan him to Eintracht Frankfurt. Forest’s attempt at a
  hijack piqued Frankfurt’s interest in Magassa, leading the Bundesliga side to
  explore whether they could muscle in on the deal on Wednesday. Magassa
  remained insistent that he wanted to join West Ham. Potter will hope that
  landing two promising young midfielders alters the mood at the London Stadium.
  West Ham made Fernandes their top target as a No8 but had two offers turned
  down. Southampton demanded at least £50m for Fernandes, who joined for £12m
  last year. It seemed a deal was unlikely when Southampton, who are looking for
  an immediate return to the Premier League, sold Tyler Dibling to Everton. They
  had indicated only one of Dibling and Fernandes would go. West Ham’s previous
  offer for Fernandes was £30m plus £2m in add-ons. Sources indicated a deal
  would be possible for a fixed fee of £35m plus a significant sell-on clause. A
  compromise has been reached on an initial fee of £35m plus £3m in add-ons, as
  well as a 15% sell-on clause. Fernandes is expected to sign his contract on
  Thursday. West Ham are also looking to sign a fast striker.
