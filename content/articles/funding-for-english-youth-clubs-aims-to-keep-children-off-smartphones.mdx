  Youth clubs and after-school activities in England will receive a funding
  injection of £88m as ministers try to get more children away from smartphones
  and computer screens. The package, which Keir Starmer announced on Tuesday, is
  intended to give pupils access to sport, outdoor activities, art, music,
  debating and volunteering. The prime minister said there was a “worrying
  trend” of young people finding themselves “isolated at home and disconnected
  from their communities”. He said the funds were designed to offer young people
  “a better alternative” and the opportunity to “develop the confidence and life
  skills that no algorithm can teach”. Of the £88m package, £22.5m is new money
  to fund extracurricular activities in up to 400 schools over three years. The
  remaining £65.5m was announced in the spending review in June. It will be
  spent on improving youth club infrastructure, including new gym equipment and
  climbing walls, in areas with high levels of child poverty and support youth
  work in areas with high rates of antisocial behaviour. The funds will also
  support local authorities to provide high-quality out-of-school activities and
  create thousands of places in youth organisations such as the Scouts, the
  Guides and the Volunteer Police Cadets. The number of youth centres run by
  local authorities in England almost halved between 2012 and 2023, with council
  spending on youth work decreasing by 75% and the number of youth workers
  falling by about 4,500. In the spring UK Youth, the country’s biggest
  youth-work charity, called on the government to urgently increase funding and
  said Labour had so far spent less than the Conservatives on youth work in
  England. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, last month told cabinet
  colleagues that deprivation, immigration and rising time spent online were
  having a “profound impact on society”. At a cabinet meeting, she said the
  government must confront people’s “real concerns” to rebuild trust. In March,
  Starmer praised the hit Netflix drama Adolescence and invited its makers to
  Downing Street to discuss the influence of toxic online material. He told the
  BBC that the series shone a light “on misogyny, on online content, and this
  sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn into this world”.
  Ministers are preparing to publish a national youth strategy in the autumn.
  Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said: “Strong local youth services are the
  bedrock of thriving communities that give our young people safe spaces to
  learn, grow and reach their potential.”
