  ‘This is probably the wildest place in the whole of the Vallée des
  Belleville,” says Roland, our guide, sweeping one arm across a bank of
  saw-toothed peaks as though conducting a great, brawny orchestra. My husband,
  two sons and I are midway through a four-day stretch of the Grand Tour de
  Tarentaise hiking trail in the French Alps, and we’ve stopped near the top of
  Varlossière, a roadless side valley among a great arc of mountains that runs
  to the west of the ski resorts of Val Thorens, Les Menuires and
  Saint-Martin-de-Belleville. Hiking up here from Gittamelon, a rustic,
  summer-only mountain refuge in the neighbouring Vallée des Encombres, we’ve
  paused to exhale breath, and to inhale the primeval views. High peaks loom
  either side of us, their shocking green flanks underscored by an elegantly
  designed bothy and its shepherd-dwelling twin, and we can hear the rush of
  water far below. It’s midmorning but the moon is low and large in a cloudless
  sky, adding to the otherworldly scene. Climbing higher, an eagle flies past
  almost at eye level, no more than six metres away. Though we meet three other
  hikers on the other side of the Col du Bonnet du Prêtre, the 2,461-metre
  (8,074ft) pass that leads from Varlossière to the Nant Brun valley – and
  detect from sheep bells that at least two shepherds must be somewhere among
  the great folds of these hills – it feels as though the landscape is ours
  alone. That may not be the case for long. Soaring temperatures across Europe
  this summer have fuelled a rush to the mountains, social media funnelling many
  visitors to the same honeypots and creating infrastructure pressure points; in
  Italy some farmers in the Dolomites have resorted to installing turnstiles and
  charging tourists €5 to pass, incensed at having their meadows trampled.
  Navigating these challenges is no easy task for Europe’s mountain resorts,
  which are increasingly encouraging summer tourism as the climate crisis
  signals a limited lifespan for ski tourism. One of the biggest issues is that
  many of these new summer visitors are first-timers, unfamiliar with the mores
  of mountain adventuring: treading gently on the environment, respecting local
  countryside codes, wearing suitable kit, knowing how to read a map rather than
  an app (we had no wifi or phone signal for two days of our hike), and packing
  enough food and water. In France, call-outs to mountain rescue services by
  inexperienced hikers have risen so sharply that workers now trawl social media
  looking for potential disaster hotspots in advance. In an attempt to tackle
  these issues, the Vallée des Belleville tourist office has introduced a range
  of summer initiatives to support new hikers, from kids’ mountain skills
  activity days to free wildlife talks and events. Lower-level footpaths and
  bike trails for children, pushchair-users and visitors with reduced mobility
  makes it safer for those groups to access the mountains, and easier for local
  communities to manage the larger numbers that tend to make use of them. And
  while challenging marked trails through more remote corners of the mountains
  are fairly easy to follow, visitors are encouraged to hire a guide (something
  we are glad of at Col du Bonnet du Prêtre, when Roland tracks down the
  shepherd owner of an aggressive dog and persuades him to move away from the
  trail). It is at our accommodation each night, in mountain refuges, that we
  really see support for new hikers in action, though. Several have been
  designed specifically with families and first-timers in mind, including Refuge
  Plan Lombardie, where we end our 12-mile (19km) hike from Gittamelon. We are
  not first-timers, but staying here is a good opportunity to remind ourselves
  of the rules of refuge culture, and for the boys to hang out with other
  children. Though we hike in, it’s possible to park about 20 minutes’ away and
  walk from there, something several guests with preschoolers have done,
  grateful for the treasure hunt-style sculpture trail the refuge has installed
  along the route to entice younger visitors uphill. Though we have seen less
  than a handful of hikers during the day, we find Refuge Plan Lombardie as
  packed as a marmot’s burrow. Approaching it in the soft glow of the afternoon,
  earlier arrivals have already nabbed the terrace’s deckchairs with a view.
  Instead, we collect beers and lemonades and find a free bench to enjoy them
  before swapping our boots for the refuge’s borrowed Crocs, and finding our
  allocated bunk beds. Refuges like this are more than just places to sleep.
  Full of city folk temporarily escaping to higher ground, they’re the human
  equivalent of a centuries-old rhythm of transhumance, where families bring
  sheep and cows up to the high pastures for the summer months. At dinner, we
  share a table with a mother from Chambéry who has brought her four-year-old
  son for his first visit to a refuge. “My friend gave me a list of the most
  family-friendly ones and I’ve decided to start a new tradition of visiting one
  every year with my son. I want him to love them as much as I do,” she told us
  between bites of a Savoyard blueberry version of Eton mess. The previous
  evening, in cosy Gittamelon refuge, we’d shared similar tales, and a dorm,
  with three generations of a Belgian family who were following the same trail
  as us but in the opposite direction. And the evening before that, we’d
  followed suit with other families, playing cards at Refuge du Lac du Lou, a
  modern, child-friendly refuge just 90 minutes’ hike above the resort of Les
  Menuires. Between Lac du Lou and Gittamelon we’d hiked with Estelle
  Roy-Berthaud from Les Menuires tourist office, following the trail through
  harebells, cotton grass, neon-coloured lichens and, much to the boys’ delight,
  thickets of wild blueberries. Stopping for lunch with Mont Blanc spearing the
  horizon in the distance, I ask her how the valley is managing increasing
  summer numbers. “Summer tourism is a relatively new concept here, so we are
  not seeing the overtourism issues experienced by more well-known summer
  destinations in the Alps,” she says. “We’re also protected by not having too
  many places to stay. In winter, we have around 27,000 beds, but in summer this
  reduces to just 8,000, so this naturally restricts the number of people in the
  valley.” Further along the trail, at Plan Lombardie, I wake in the night and
  slip out of one of those beds. Outside, the sky is luminous with stars, while
  the peaks and folds of the land are now entirely black beyond the winking of a
  distant light – a shepherd’s stove, perhaps, or the torch of a camper. The
  Belleville valley still feels wonderfully wild tonight. Transport from London
  to Chambéry was provided by Flixbus; return fares from £89pp. Half-board
  accommodation at Refuge du Lac du Lou from €39 children/€69 adults, Refuge
  Gittamelon €46pp, and at Refuge Plan Lombardie from €32 children and €52
  adults. Hiking guides from €25 for a half-day (guides-belleville.com). More
