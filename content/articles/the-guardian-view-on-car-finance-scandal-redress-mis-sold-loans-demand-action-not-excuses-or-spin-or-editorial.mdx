  With its ruling in the car finance case, the UK supreme court sent a clear
  message: some motorists purchased vehicles with deals that were indeed unfair,
  but it’s not the judiciary’s job to redraw the boundaries of consumer
  protection law. That burden, the justices suggested, rests with regulators and
  elected governments. This reasoning is in line with a major speech in June by
  the court’s president, Lord Reed, who argued that judges aren’t policymakers –
  and shouldn’t be. He led a bench that nonetheless upheld a finding of
  unfairness in the case of the factory supervisor Marcus Johnson. The court
  flagged the danger, defined the threshold – but stopped short of imposing
  redress itself. Now, the baton has been passed. Millions could get payouts if
  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) follows the court ruling with its
  proposed redress scheme, now out for consultation. The regulator admits what
  courts and campaigners have long suggested: that hidden commissions and opaque
  contracts were endemic, and that consumers were misled on a large scale. It
  may be 2025, but the roots of this scandal stretch back decades. More than 90%
  of new car purchases are financed, and for years, buyers weren’t offered the
  best deal – just the one that earned the broker the biggest cut. Last October,
  the court of appeal saw hidden commissions as tantamount to bribes – secret
  incentives to push pricier loans. Banks had been on the hook for potentially
  £40bn in compensation had that view prevailed. But the supreme court
  disagreed. Dealers aren’t fiduciaries, it said. They’re not priests or
  doctors. They’re salespeople and everyone knows it. The Treasury had tried,
  and failed, to intervene on behalf of banks that feared big payouts. The
  supreme court dismissed that petition with waspish brevity. Rachel Reeves may
  argue she was guarding financial stability, but it is not a good look to be
  siding with lenders over misled consumers, especially when there is a strong
  case to suggest regulators had been asleep at the wheel. The FCA now admits
  that many firms broke the rules. It plans a compensation scheme covering loans
  dating back to 2007, including both discretionary and some non-discretionary
  commission arrangements. The potential bill? At least £9bn, and possibly
  double that. Most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in
  compensation. The court’s refusal to stretch the law to encompass issues of
  trust wasn’t a shrug; it was a signal. The law allows unfairness to be
  addressed. But the heavy lifting must be done by the state. This episode lays
  bare a deeper malaise. Britain’s credit system often runs on skewed incentives
  and asymmetric information. Brokers pose as advisers but act as
  commission-driven salespeople. In Mr Johnson’s case a £1,650 hidden commission
  – a quarter of the car’s price – went undisclosed. That’s not a quirk; it’s
  economics’ classic lemons problem. In car finance, consumers didn’t know how
  much brokers were pocketing or how that skewed the deal. Without trust or
  clarity, quality suffers – and everyone overpays for “lemons” (duds). The
  court of appeal did focus minds; and failing to interpret the law robustly in
  the face of clear wrongdoing is itself a judicial choice. The supreme court
  smartly redirected the narrative. The regulator is stirring. Ministers must
  now support a consumer-facing system of redress and not shield the City from
  the consequences of its own mis‑selling. The public will be watching.
