  A Toast Fae the Lassies review – Robert Burns’s women torn between seduction
  and outrage
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  Safe to say that Agnes Broun, Jean Armour and the woman known only as Clarinda
  never met at the grave of Robert Burns to commemorate his birthday. Even safer
  to say that had mother, wife and upper-class lover had such a meeting, they
  would not have spent the time filling each other in on their relationship with
  the great poet. No matter. The contrivance of John Binnie’s play, set on 25
  January with an eye to performances on Burns Nights to come, paves the way for
  what really makes this show tick: an attractive compilation of favourite
  songs, sweetly sung by Alyson Orr (Agnes), Stephanie Cremona (Jean) and Eden
  Barrie (Clarinda), following the pretty harmonies of Orr’s arrangements and
  the simple acoustic guitar accompaniment of Chris Coxon. Seen at a preview
  performance, A Toast Fae the Lassies quickly makes you forget the staginess of
  the setup. The artifice seems more than justified by such tender renditions of
  Ae Fond Kiss, Charlie Is My Darling and A Red, Red Rose, as well as other
  songs and poems, especially when the actors step out of character to take on
  other scenes from the poet’s life. Harder to overlook is the graveyard set by
  Natalie Fern, which, with its raised platforms and scattered headstones,
  becomes an obstacle course for the actors, moving about the limited studio
  space in their period dress. It is needlessly cluttered. But what emerges
  forcibly, as the women trade notes, is a picture of a man who today would be
  called a sex addict. By the time he married Jean Armour, Burns had fathered
  several children by her – and by others, too – and however cerebral his
  meeting of minds with Clarinda, it did not stop him impregnating her maid.
  Here, the women are torn between being seduced and being outraged. On the one
  hand, the captivating hold of his language; on the other, poems they see as
  thinly disguised excuses for his philandering. In this way, Binnie, who also
  directs, paints a portrait of a contradictory man, one capable of indifference
  and tenderness, crude animal instinct and timeless beauty. It adds grit to a
  crowd-pleasing show. • At Pitlochry Festival theatre until 24 September
