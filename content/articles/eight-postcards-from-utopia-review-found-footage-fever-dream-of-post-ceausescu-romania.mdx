  Eight Postcards from Utopia review – found-footage fever dream of
  post-Ceauşescu Romania
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-08T06:00:03Z'
bodyText: >-
  Part of cinema’s Romanian wave has been a shrewd, satirically surreal use of
  archive clips as a way of remembering the strangeness of the country’s
  communist and pre-communist past. In 2010, Andrei Ujică’s three-hour The
  Autobiography of Nicolae Ceauşescu was a film footage collage of his
  dictatorial life and times; and in 2020 Radu Jude’s The Exit of the Trains
  used official archive material to shed light on wartime antisemitism. Jude,
  with co-director Christian Ferencz-Flatz, has now curated a found-footage
  fever dream of Romania’s post-Ceauşescu passion for capitalism. It is a mosaic
  of moments from TV ads in the 1990s, frantically flogging everything: soft
  drinks, sausages, laxatives, a new Dracula-based theme park, shares in
  Thatcher-style government privatisation schemes and mobile phones. One rather
  witty ad has Ceauşescu making a speech being interrupted by a phone – the
  tagline promises “free speech”. Romanian legends like Ilie Năstase and Nadia
  Comăneci appear, while the clips are broadly divided into chapter-headings;
  one tranche of ads displaying gender stereotypes is introduced with the
  Godardian intertitle “Masculine Feminine”. Sometimes Jude and Ferencz-Flatz
  take out the audio entirely so we can just focus on the eerie garish images in
  silence. Freeze-frames show us the quasi-porn ecstatic closing of eyes at the
  moment of taste. Ads for actual porn phone lines show us something similar. In
  one “cutting room floor” moment, we see multiple takes of an unhappy actor in
  an ad for financial services stumbling over the line “We all strive to
  multiply your money” over and over again. It’s an amusing collection – a
  glimpse of the id of Romania’s new psyche – but perhaps the same thing could
  be done and the same point made with TV ads from anywhere in the world. (In
  our online social media world, these expensively crafted vignettes themselves
  look a little antique.) I wonder if there is moreover a touch of naivety in a
  prestigious movie director treating ads as crude, almost unauthored primitive
  material to be ironically edited and juxtaposed by a higher artistic mind.
  Many advertising directors, after all, go on to make brilliant films –
  including the great Romanian auteur Cristian Mungiu who, before he was an
  arthouse film-maker of note, made a series of amusing TV ads for mobile phones
  featuring the yet-to-be-discovered actor Vlad Ivanov. At any rate, this is a
  diverting addition to Jude’s filmography. • Eight Postcards from Utopia is on
  Mubi from 8 August.
