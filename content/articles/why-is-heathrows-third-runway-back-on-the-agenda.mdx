  What is happening with Heathrow’s proposed third runway? The government has
  put big infrastructure at the heart of its strategy to kickstart economic
  growth – particularly if paid for through private investment – and has vowed
  to make building easier. Few projects come as big, or at such an advanced
  stage of planning, as Heathrow’s expansion. With record numbers of passengers,
  Europe’s busiest airport is at capacity, and it has new owners with deep
  pockets who see an opportunity to invest. Didn’t it already get permission to
  build a runway – what happened? Yes, more than once. The Conservatives
  overturned Heathrow’s original plan, which was approved by Labour in 2009,
  before setting up an independent airports commission, which found a new runway
  was needed. The plans were endorsed by the government and voted through
  parliament in 2018, and were eventually upheld by the courts. But then Covid
  happened, passengers disappeared, and Heathrow never submitted a full planning
  application. So are these new plans? They are fundamentally the same as last
  time, but Heathrow now believes it can pack in even more flights and
  passengers – up to 150 million a year – due to bigger planes and operational
  advances. It will cost more too because of inflation: £21bn for the runway;
  another £12bn to expand its terminals; and a further £15bn to upgrade the rest
  of the airport to match. Will the runway still go over the M25? Part of the
  engineering challenge is getting a runway over Britain’s busiest motorway, the
  M25 orbiting London, at one of its most congested points. At a cost of £1.5bn,
  Heathrow plans to build a new stretch of M25 further west, with the runway
  going over the top, ready for cars to be switched overnight and allow it to
  complete the rest of the two-mile strip. It believes this is still better
  value and more efficient than situating the runway further to the east, which
  would mean demolishing more houses and putting much more of west London under
  noisy flightpaths. What happens next? The government is officially reviewing
  the plan, as well as an alternative proposal submitted by the Arora group,
  alongside the existing airports national policy statement, to “ensure that any
  scheme is delivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate
  obligations”. A response is expected in early autumn and, if green-lit,
  Heathrow could launch a formal public consultation before submitting a full
  planning application. However, its new owners, which include Saudi Arabia and
  Qatar, want to be sure that the legal and political context has shifted enough
  for its near-£50bn investment plans to come to fruition. That means passing
  the planning bill, so neither bat, newt, nor judicial review blocks the
  runway. It also hopes for progress on airspace modernisation, to ensure the
  additional 750 planes a day can fly over London as required; and most of all,
  guarantees that the Civil Aviation Authority will let Heathrow charge airlines
  enough to recoup its investment. What about net zero? What indeed. The
  airports commission view a decade ago was that a third Heathrow runway could
  be compatible with the UK’s climate commitments, so long as other aviation
  growth was constrained. However, airports around the UK are also now looking
  to expand, not least Heathrow’s London rivals. Stansted’s growth was
  enthusiastically endorsed at an early Labour “growth summit” and the transport
  secretary, Heidi Alexander, has given the green light to plans to double the
  size of Luton airport. She has also said she was minded to approve Gatwick’s
  second runway plans, with a decision expected soon. What’s the good news? Tens
  of thousands of jobs created, economic growth, and competition, cheaper fares
  and new destinations for passengers flying from Heathrow. And the bad? Another
  276,000 flights a year overhead, adding to noise and air pollution. Locally,
  750 homes bulldozed, and years of disruption in construction for the rest. And
  an estimated extra 4.4m tonnes of CO2 a year from resulting flights,
  contributing to the climate emergency.
