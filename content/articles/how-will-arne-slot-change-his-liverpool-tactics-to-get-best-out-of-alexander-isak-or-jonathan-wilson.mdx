  On the face of it, it’s not hard to see why Liverpool would want Alexander
  Isak. He will not turn 26 until later this month and has scored more than 20
  Premier League goals in each of the past two seasons, something matched only
  by Erling Haaland. But he offers more than just goals; he’s a very modern
  centre-forward. Thirty or 40 years ago, when 4-4-2 was still the dominant
  formation, strike pairings tended to come in two forms: either target-man and
  finisher, or creator and finisher. These days, the very best centre-forwards
  combine traits of all three. This is not entirely new: the days of Kenny
  Dalglish and Ian Rush or Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips are long gone and
  football has been familiar for some time with players of the ilk of Didier
  Drogba, Andriy Shevchenko and Radamel Falcao, forwards with pace and some
  blend of physicality and technical ability. Haaland, huge and fast and a fine
  finisher, felt like a one-man extension of that, almost a generational freak
  in the manner of the fabled Argentinian Bernabé Ferreyra or the flawed Russian
  great Eduard Streltsov. But while Haaland at 6ft 5in still leads the way in
  terms of being a blend of size and pace, there are plenty of others in his
  mould. This summer’s transfer window has been characterised by the great
  carousel of strikers, most of whom conform to the template. Isak is 6ft 4in,
  Benjamin Sesko and Nick Woltemade are 6ft 5in, Viktor Gyökeres, Hugo Ekitiké
  and Randal Kolo Muani are 6ft 2in, and Liam Delap and Victor Osimhen are 6ft
  1in, yet none of them could be classed as target men. All are mobile, all have
  technical ability and none are reliant on trundling to the back post to meet
  long diagonals. Isak has not historically been especially prolific in the air,
  and his relatively wiry build means he is not going to bully many
  centre-backs, but four of his 23 goals last season were headers, including
  arguably his most memorable, as he met an outswinging cross from Anthony
  Gordon on the right to get the winner against Arsenal. More obviously
  eye-catching is his capacity to run the channels and work across the front
  line, receiving the ball in wide areas as well as in the box. Although he was
  mainly used as a central striker at Real Sociedad, there were times there when
  he played on both the left and the right flanks. Given how Cody Gakpo and
  Mohamed Salah naturally cut infield, and so need the striker to get out of the
  way to create space for them, it’s easy to see how the three could form an
  extremely fluid forward line, but with the added advantage that Isak can be
  used more in the manner of a traditional striker to try to meet crosses,
  albeit more with clever movement than by overpowering his markers. He also has
  an explosive turn of pace, so could perhaps benefit from through balls played
  by Florian Wirtz. That suggests it will usually be a case of Isak or Ekitiké
  in the starting lineup, although the France international, like Isak, is
  mobile and by no means fixed to a central role. At Eintracht Frankfurt there
  were times when Ekitiké played alongside Omar Marmoush in a 4-4-2. Although
  that would not seem a natural way to get the best out of Salah, there’s no
  reason why Ekitiké and Isak could not play as a pair, whether that is in a
  4-4-2 – Gakpo has at times played on the left side of midfield and, given
  Dominik Szoboszlai’s new-found capacity to operate at full-back, it would seem
  reasonable to suppose he could also operate as a narrow right-sided
  midfielder, perhaps with Jeremie Frimpong overlapping. Beginning to plan for a
  future after Salah makes sense. He is 33 and his contract expires in 2027,
  meaning next summer would seem a logical time to offload him. Without Salah,
  there is less need to stick to the 4-3-3 that has characterised how Liverpool
  have played for most of the past decade, even if Slot is characteristically
  Dutch in his preference for wide forwards. For all the drama and money spent,
  Liverpool have ended up with as many forwards as they had last season. It may
  feel distasteful to discuss the tragedy of Diogo Jota’s death in the context
  of squad planning but the grim reality is that he left a space that the club
  had to fill. With Darwin Núñez and Luis Díaz sold, and Wirtz, Ekitiké and Isak
  arriving, Liverpool’s squad has similar depth to last season, but perhaps
  greater quality. The doubt is that, for all its versatility, it is a little
  more focused on the centre. And the bigger concern, perhaps, is that the squad
  suddenly looks very frontloaded. For all the attacking options, there is a
  danger Liverpool are left short at the back of midfield. But if Szoboszlai can
  be an effective right-back, Slot could have all manner of contingencies lined
  up.
