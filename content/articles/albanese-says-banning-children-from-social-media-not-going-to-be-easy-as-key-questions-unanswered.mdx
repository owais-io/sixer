  Anthony Albanese admits banning children from social media “is not going to be
  simple”, with questions still unanswered over how tech platforms will check
  the ages of all Australian users – and which platforms will be included – when
  the government imposes its under 16s social media ban this year. The
  communications minister, Anika Wells, said on Wednesday the onus will be on
  platforms to design simple solutions, claiming there are “lots of ways” tech
  companies could check the ages of their users. The government is still waiting
  on results from a trial of age assurance technology, but is pressing on with
  plans for the ban to come into force on 10 December. “We will not be
  intimidated by legal threats, when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing
  of Australian kids,” Wells said on Wednesday. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  The government announced on Wednesday it would backflip on an earlier stance
  and include YouTube in the under 16s social media ban after all. The
  Google-owned video platform had earlier been promised an exemption, but it
  will now join Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, X and TikTok on the list of
  platforms to be banned for those under 16. While the government named select
  platforms in its announcement, the rules do not specify platforms covered by
  the ban, but instead list factors that could see platforms excluded from the
  ban. Smaller services – such as Discord, Twitch, Trump’s Truth Social or X
  rival Bluesky – may be required to comply. The rules would seemingly exclude
  LinkedIn, which had argued to the government during the development of the
  legislation it was not something that was of interest to children. From
  December, platforms which do not take “reasonable steps” to stop children from
  holding accounts on those platforms will be liable for fines up to $49.5m.
  Wells said such platforms will have to deactivate existing accounts of
  children, ensure no new ones are established and stop any efforts to skirt
  those rules. But some major tech platforms have privately raised concerns
  about a lack of information about what they must to do to meet the “reasonable
  steps” test, including what new barriers or verification methods they must add
  to their services. The government is expected to share more information and
  guidance about such steps in coming months. Wells pushed back on the concerns
  of the platforms, saying the government had outlined its expectations last
  year when the legislation passed parliament, and that the tech companies
  should be engaging with the eSafety commissioner on their responses. “Social
  media platforms have been on notice since December last year that this was
  coming. They have had 12 months to work with the eSafety Commissioner to
  determine what that looks like for their individual platforms,” she told a
  press conference in Parliament House. “The onus here is on the platforms. Come
  10 December, if your kid has a Facebook login, Facebook account, it is on
  Facebook to deactivate that account. It’s not on the parent to police that on
  behalf of Facebook. “These are not set-and-forget rules, these are
  set-and-support rules. They are world-leading. But this is manifestly too
  important for us not to have a crack.” YouTube last week wrote to the
  government, vowing to consider legal action if it was included in the ban. The
  company on Wednesday claimed YouTube was a video platform “not social media”.
  “We share the government’s goal of addressing and reducing online harms,” a
  spokesperson said. “The government’s announcement today reverses a clear,
  public commitment to exclude YouTube from this ban. We will consider next
  steps and will continue to engage with the government.” Albanese said the
  government wanted to be “cooperative” but believed tech companies could
  implement the ban with existing information they held. “We acknowledge that
  this is not going to be simple or easy … Some of this will be inevitably a
  work-in-progress,” he said. “But what we know is that social media does have
  more information about what [a person] does than perhaps some people who are
  your close friends. Where you go, who you talk to, what you’re interested in,
  you know, they do keep that information … They can use the capacity which we
  know that they have.” While the Coalition backed the social media ban, the
  shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, accused the government of a
  “blatant broken promise” over including YouTube after its prior exemption.
  “When the government introduced the legislation in November, they specifically
  excluded YouTube. This was the premise on which the legislation passed the
  Parliament,” she said. “The Albanese Labor government can change a Minister,
  but they cannot hide the fact they deliberately misled the public,” McIntosh
  said. Greens spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young called the push “delusional”,
  calling for stricter rules and a duty of care for users. “A blanket ban is
  simply a blunt instrument that will not make kids safer, we know that kids are
  going to get around it.” Albanese will use the United Nations general assembly
  in September to drum up international support for Australia’s world-first
  social media crackdown. He said Australia would hold an event at the session
  in New York City, to advocate for the policy.
