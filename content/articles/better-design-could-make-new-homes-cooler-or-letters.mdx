  There are two main issues driving the problem of overheating in modern housing
  (Overheated homes: why UK housing is dangerously unprepared for impact of
  climate crisis, 10 August). First, in order to maximise profit, developers
  often do the bare minimum required by legislation, without any consideration
  of the building’s performance in use over its lifespan. This desire for
  economy also often leads to the reduction of natural elements (such as tree
  planting in urban areas), which may otherwise assist in tempering heat
  buildup. Second, too often we seek to solve fundamental flaws in the building
  design with bolt-on solutions, when instead we should design for climate
  resilience from the outset. The move towards air conditioning as a response to
  overheating problems illustrates this. Even the new Part O building
  regulations – which cover ensuring that homes do not overheat – allow the use
  of machinery rather than requiring an adequately responsive building fabric.
  Design expertise from environmentally minded professionals such as chartered
  architectural technologists can help to overcome these problems without using
  energy-hungry machinery. Considering the orientation of the building,
  incorporating a natural ventilation strategy and utilising materials in the
  building’s fabric that mitigate heat gain can greatly reduce the risk of
  overheating. But such principles are often disregarded in order to cut costs.
  The climatic situation we find ourselves in requires a shift in the very
  basics of building design. The knowledge is available. It just needs to be
  employed. Chris Halligan Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists
