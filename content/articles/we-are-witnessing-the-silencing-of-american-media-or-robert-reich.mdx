  The latest casualty of Donald Trump’s efforts to silence media criticism is
  Eduardo Porter, one of the most thoughtful and intelligent critics of his
  heinous regime. On Tuesday, Porter wrote his last column for the Washington
  Post. In a widely circulated email, he explained why he was leaving the Post:
  Jeff Bezos and his new head of Opinion are taking the paper down a path I
  cannot follow, directed toward the relentless promotion of free markets and
  personal liberties … I have no idea to what extent this is driven by Mr Bezos’
  fear of what Donald Trump could do to his various business interests, most of
  which are more valuable to him than The Post.” Well, I do have an idea. Bezos
  stopped the Post from endorsing Kamala Harris. Amazon made a huge contribution
  to Trump’s inauguration. And he stood in front of Trump at the president’s
  swearing in. Why? Because Bezos has founded a bunch of mega-corporations,
  including Amazon, that depend on Trump’s goodwill and could be in deep trouble
  if Trump decided to retaliate against Bezos. It’s much the same story with
  Stephen Colbert, longtime host of CBS’s The Late Show and the top-rated
  late-night talkshow host in the US. On 14 July, Colbert openly criticized
  CBS’s parent company, Paramount, for its $16m settlement with Trump over his
  frivolous lawsuit over the routine editing of a 60 Minutes interview with
  Kamala Harris that Trump claimed gave her an unfair advantage in the 2024
  election. Said Colbert in his opening monologue: As someone who has always
  been a proud employee of this network, I am offended. And I don’t know if
  anything will ever repair my trust in this company … I believe this kind of
  complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a
  technical name in legal circles. It’s a big fat bribe. Because this all comes
  as Paramount’s owners are trying to get the Trump administration to approve
  the sale of our network to a new owner, Skydance.” Three days later, on 17
  July, Paramount pulled the plug on Colbert’s show, eliciting from Trump a
  celebratory: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.” (A few days later,
  Colbert came out swinging, telling Trump to “go fuck yourself”, and joking
  that it had always been his dream to have a sitting president celebrate the
  end of his career.) On Thursday, one week after Colbert’s show was cancelled,
  Trump’s Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s sale to
  Skydance. To clinch the deal, Skydance promised that it would eliminate all
  US-based diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Paramount and CBS and
  create a new ombudsman to field complaints of supposed bias in news coverage
  (presumably anything critical of Trump). Let’s be clear. Bezos has silenced
  any criticism of Trump on the editorial pages of the Washington Post because
  Bezos fears Trump’s wrath. CBS and its parent corporation, Paramount, have
  silenced criticism of Trump on Colbert’s hugely popular late-night show
  because its top corporate brass fears Trump’s wrath. The new owner of CBS has
  agreed to some federal interference in the content of what it produces because
  he fears Trump’s wrath. It’s the same with American universities, whose
  professors have often criticized Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional actions
  and whose research has often yielded conclusions that contradict Trump’s lies
  (such as that climate change is a “hoax”). Columbia University and a handful
  of others have gone out of their way to “cooperate” with the Trump regime in
  order to avoid Trump’s wrath. What does “cooperation” entail? Silencing
  Trump’s potential critics. Columbia has just agreed to allow the regime to
  review its admissions and hiring practices in order to receive the federal
  research grants that the regime had held back. Friends, this is how democracy
  dies. The silencing is happening across America because Trump cannot stand
  criticism, because he’s vindictive as hell, and because he’s willing and able
  to use every department and agency of the federal government to punish any
  media corporations or universities that allow criticism of him. Shame on any
  media outlet or university that allows Trump to silence it. Trump is a
  dangerous despot. America needs its Eduardo Porters, Stephen Colberts, and all
  others in the media and in academia who have helped the nation understand just
  how truly dangerous Trump is. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is
  a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California,
  Berkeley. He is a Guardian US columnist. His newsletter is at
  robertreich.substack.com. His next book, Coming Up Short: A Memoir of My
  America, will be out on 5 August
