  Thomas Tuchel will be forced on to an outside stage on Friday afternoon when
  he names his first England squad of the season for the World Cup qualifiers
  against Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday week and Serbia in Belgrade three
  days after. With Coldplay continuing with their tour dates at Wembley, the
  Football Association has been forced to find an alternative venue for Tuchel’s
  announcement and will use the nearby Hilton hotel. It is no problem for
  Tuchel, who is a massive music fan. But what the England manager will be
  acutely aware of is the need to get his own show on the road. Where are we
  with Tuchel’s England gig? The top line from the previous get-together in June
  was provided by the soundtrack of boos. They came from the travelling fans at
  half-time and full-time in the lacklustre 1-0 win over Andorra in Barcelona
  and there were more when the final whistle went on the 3-1 friendly defeat
  against Senegal at the City Ground. Tuchel’s team did show some zip and
  personality in the final 25 minutes against Senegal before Cheikh Sabaly’s
  clinching goal in the 93rd minute. Tuchel had Eberechi Eze playing off Morgan
  Rogers up front, Noni Madueke on the right, Morgan Gibbs-White on the left and
  Jude Bellingham in a deeper-than-normal midfield role. It was probably the
  most exciting spell of football under Tuchel, partly because there had not
  been much to quicken the pulse in his first camp in March which contained the
  Wembley wins over Albania and Latvia – solid and controlled performances, if
  unspectacular. That said, England were distinctly second-best against Senegal
  until the 65th minute when they trailed 2-1 and Tuchel was exasperated and
  bemused after it all. Where was the joy of wearing the shirt? There is an
  argument that the autumn programme will be more beneficial to Tuchel. England
  face Wales in a Wembley friendly and travel to Latvia in October; they have
  Serbia (home) and Albania (away) in November. With the matches coming thicker
  and faster, he will have greater opportunity to build the rhythms he craves,
  even if it does re-raise an awkward question. Could the FA not have brought in
  Tuchel this time last year instead of relying on the interim manager, Lee
  Carsley, for the first half of the season? Tuchel has worked hard to stay in
  touch with the players and has been around the grounds this season. On the
  Premier League’s opening weekend, he attended Aston Villa v Newcastle and
  Wolves v Manchester City on the Saturday before going to Manchester United v
  Arsenal on the Sunday. On game-week two, he took in West Ham v Chelsea on the
  Friday, Brentford v Villa on the Saturday and Crystal Palace v Nottingham
  Forest on the Sunday. After United v Arsenal, Tuchel was seen chatting to Luke
  Shaw and Mason Mount in the Old Trafford tunnel. Could either return to the
  squad? Both have looked sharp, despite United’s poor start. Shaw’s case
  carries extra significance given the well-documented issues at left-back.
  Myles Lewis-Skelly has lost his starting place at Arsenal to Riccardo
  Calafiori. Newcastle’s Tino Livramento is in contention. The wider point is
  that talking is one thing; there is no substitute for getting out on the grass
  to work. Tuchel will surely have a view on a statistic from the first
  game-week. Only 77 of those to feature were eligible for England – a record
  opening weekend low, down from 93 the year before. Of the 77, 54 were
  starters, representing less than a quarter of the 220 players. Tuchel is
  unlikely to experiment with first-time call-ups, rather to concentrate on
  fine-tuning what he has already seen. There are only four camps to go before
  the World Cup next summer. Furthermore, because these ties come so early in
  the season, he has little evidence to make the case for recalls. Jack Grealish
  played well on his full debut for Everton against Brighton last Sunday,
  setting up both the goals in a 2-0 win. Is it enough? The spotlight will also
  pick out Marcus Rashford, who missed the June internationals because of injury
  and is making his way at Barcelona. On the face of it, the forward has not
  done much in his two La Liga appearances and was substituted at half-time
  against Levante last Saturday with his team 2-0 down. They came back to win
  3-2. But that was more because Hansi Flick tried a new attacking formation
  that did not work. He went back to normal for the second half. It was not
  Rashford’s fault. Tuchel selected Rashford in March. He believes in him.
  Tuchel must make do without the usual clutch of injured players. Levi Colwill,
  Bukayo Saka and Bellingham are out; Cole Palmer is a major doubt and so is Ben
  White, who has been touted for a long-awaited comeback. Phil Foden returned as
  a late substitute for City against Tottenham only last Saturday after an ankle
  knock in pre-season. How Tuchel uses him remains a fascination. At the back,
  Tuchel will be able to select John Stones for the first time after the City
  centre-half missed the closing months of last season through injury and Marc
  Guéhi is available after sitting out the June fixtures with an eye problem.
  Harry Maguire’s ship seems to have sailed and what about Kyle Walker, now at
  Burnley, who endured such a torrid game against Senegal? England have not
  played in Serbia at senior level since 1987 when Sir Bobby Robson’s team beat
  Yugoslavia 4-1 to secure their place at the European Championship finals. The
  goals from Peter Beardsley, John Barnes, Bryan Robson and Tony Adams came
  inside the opening 25 minutes and the Rajko Mitic Stadium, then known as the
  Stadion Crvena Zvezda and still commonly as Marakana, was stunned. It will
  pulse to its usual intimidating beat when England return for what is plainly
  their most difficult assignment of qualification. The real business is afoot.
