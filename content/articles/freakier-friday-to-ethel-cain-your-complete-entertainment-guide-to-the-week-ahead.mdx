  Going out: Cinema Freakier Friday Out now More than 20 years ago, Jamie Lee
  Curtis and Lindsay Lohan starred in what was already the third big-screen
  incarnation of the novel by Mary Rodgers. The premise of a mother swapping
  bodies with her daughter clearly has staying power, with Curtis and Lohan back
  to reprise their roles in this sequel. Weapons Out now In 2022, Zach regger
  burst on to the scene with the witty and surprising horror movie Barbarian.
  This is his hotly anticipated follow-up, starring Julia Garner, Alden
  Ehrenreich and Benedict Wong, in which all but one child from the same class
  mysteriously disappear overnight. The Kingdom Out now Introducing newcomers
  Ghjuvanna Benedetti and Saveriu Santucci, director Julien Colonna’s debut –
  which premiered at the Cannes film festival – sees a 15-year-old girl and her
  crime-boss dad go on the run in Corsica. In Character: The Films of Peter
  Sellers BFI Southbank, London, to 31 August UK radio star turned
  internationally famous comedian whom Robin Williams crowned “the most
  influential actor in films”, Sellers would have been 100 this year. To mark
  his centenary, there’s a season at the BFI including such classics as The
  Ladykillers, Two Way Stretch and Heavens Above. Catherine Bray * * * Going
  out: Gigs The Smashing Pumpkins Gunnersbury Park, London, 10 August With three
  of the band’s four original members back onboard, the Smashing Pumpkins return
  to the UK following last year’s tour with Weezer. This time they’re bringing
  their brand of epic alt-rock to west London for an all-day festival including
  Skunk Anansie and White Lies. Michael Cragg Redman 12 to 15 August; tour
  starts Glasgow After last year dropping the guest-heavy Muddy Waters Too, the
  sequel to his 1996 classic, New Jersey rap great Redman arrives in the UK for
  a rare tour. As well as doing a handful of his own shows, he’ll also join
  Busta Rhymes for South Facing festival in south London. MC Eva Ollikainen,
  Johannes Moser and the BBC Symphony Orchestra Royal Albert Hall, London, 13
  August The notion of teetering on the edge, of balancing on the verge of many
  opposites, lies behind her new cello concerto, says Anna Thorvaldsdottir.
  First performed in Los Angeles in May, Before We Fall is brought to the Proms
  by the cellist for whom it was composed, Johannes Moser; Eva Ollikainen
  conducts the BBC SO. Andrew Clements We Out Here festival Wimborne St Giles,
  Dorset, 14 to 17 August Surreal wizardry still sparkles for 89-year-old
  Brazilian multi-instrumentalist and global-jazz one-off Hermeto Pascoal, an
  influence on legends including Miles Davis – though 2025 may include his last
  European visits. On Thursday, Pascoal’s band joins a raft of contemporary
  innovators for DJ-producer Gilles Peterson’s four-day Dorset-based festival.
  John Fordham * * * Going out: Art John Bellany City Art Centre, Edinburgh, to
  28 September Inspired by the disturbing visions of Otto Dix and admired by
  Damien Hirst, this hard-living expressionist regularly scrutinised his own
  image and experiences, including taking to his easel just after a liver
  transplant. Tai Shani Somerset House, London, to 14 September Surrealistic
  sculptor Shani has created a statue of a blue sleeping figure for the fountain
  courtyard of Somerset House. While children play in the fountains this
  sculpture sleeps, but what dreams may come? There’s a sound element in the
  style of a radio chatshow with Brian Eno and more. Future of Food Science
  Museum, London, to 4 January A loaf of bread that’s 3,500 years old is one of
  the exhibits in this survey of the past and present of food, as well as its
  future. The history of how humanity has sustained itself since early times
  leads up to the challenges of our nourishment and survival now. Nicolas Party
  Holburne Museum, Bath, to 19 October The Swiss-born Party, who started out as
  a street artist, shows a comic wall-filling mural inspired by a 17th-century
  painting in the Holburne collection: Benjamin Gerritsz Cuyp’s A Brawl Between
  Peasants is a carnivalesque mock battle in the tradition of Bruegel. Party
  riffs on it and supersizes the mayhem. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage
  Urooj Ashfaq Monkey Barrel Comedy, Edinburgh, to 24 August Expectations are
  always sky high when a best newcomer winner returns to the fringe, but this
  Indian standup is done with people pleasing. Her new show, How to Be a Baddie,
  is a tongue-in-cheek rejection of the sweet, everygirl persona that has
  underpinned her comedy to date. Rachel Aroesti Little Angel Theatre Children’s
  Puppet festival Little Angel Theatre, London, to 31 August This popular puppet
  festival includes marionette puppetry, singalong stories, comedy, puppet
  playcations, craft workshops – and even a few shows for adults. Miriam
  Gillinson Shedinburgh fringe festival Edinburgh College of Art, to 24 August A
  brand new venue for the Edinburgh fringe from Francesca Moody Productions,
  with a mixture of big names and indie cult favourites. Confirmed acts include
  poet-playwright Kieran Hurley, the Showstoppers and Edinburgh stalwart Mark
  Watson. MG Romeo &amp; Juliet St Stephen’s Theatre, Edinburgh, 13 to 21 August
  A revival of Frederick Ashton’s Romeo and Juliet from 1955. Much less
  well-known than Kenneth MacMillan’s version, it’s being mounted by veteran
  Danish dancer and artistic director Peter Schaufuss, whose parents danced in
  the original production. Lyndsey Winship * * * Staying in: Streaming Alien:
  Earth Disney+, 13 August Having turned Fargo from a cult film into an
  acclaimed five-season TV series, showrunner Noah Hawley will be hoping to
  repeat the trick with this prequel to the 1979 blockbuster Alien. Sydney
  Chandler leads the cast as Wendy, a human-robot hybrid who fronts a team of
  “synthetics” as they battle against horrifying unknown life forms. Amsterdam
  Narcos Now/Sky Documentaries, 13 August, 9pm This anthology-style documentary
  series is proving a winning franchise for Sky: after programmes on Dublin,
  Ibiza and Liverpool comes this series about the strange history of
  drug-dealing in the Netherlands’ capital. Episode one looks at how the
  country’s decriminalisation of marjuana in the 1970s led to an influx of
  organised crime. In Flight Channel 4, 12 August, 9pm More drug-smuggling, this
  time of the fictional, airborne variety as Katherine Kelly stars as a flight
  attendant who is blackmailed into couriering class As after her son is jailed
  in Bulgaria for murder. Co-creaters Mike Walden and Slow Horses director Adam
  Randall helm what is guaranteed to be a turbulent trip. Confessions of a
  Steroids Gang iPlayer/BBC Three, 12 August, 9pm Yet more drug-smuggling, this
  time of the legally ambiguous variety. This three-part documentary examines
  the case of a father and son from a small town in north Wales, whose
  shed-based steroids shop expanded into a full-blown criminal enterprise
  involving Chinese imports and dodgy distribution networks. RA * * * Staying
  in: Games Drag x Drive Switch 2; out 14 August One of the more innovative
  titles in the Switch 2’s launch year, this wheelchair basketball sim allows
  you to control your vehicle by sliding two joycons along a flat surface,
  mimicking a wheel pushing action. The three-v-three multiplayer matches are
  fast-paced, recalling the excellent car football game Rocket League, and those
  controls bring a whole new feel to team-based e-sports. Madden NFL 26 PC, PS5,
  Switch 2, Xbox; out 14 August The annual gridiron sim returns with an array of
  updates including improved match physics for truly bone-shaking collisions, an
  in-depth coaching mode and a new real-time weather system that can hit you
  with a sudden rainstorm, completely changing the playing surface. If you’ve
  any interest in America’s beautiful game, now is the time to dip a cleat in.
  Keith Stuart * * * Staying in: Albums Amaarae – Black Star Out now On her
  third album, the Ghanaian-American genre experimentalist travelled to Brazil,
  adding baile funk to a sonic soup that already includes pop, R&amp;B,
  Afrobeats and new wave. This follow-up to 2023’s Fountain Baby includes the
  shapeshifting singles S.M.O and Girlie-Pop!. Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker,
  I’ll Always Love You Out now After January’s terrifying drone opus Perverts
  comes this proper follow-up to Florida cult superstar Hayden Anhedönia’s
  breakthrough, Preacher’s Daughter. Lyrically it acts as prequel to that debut,
  exploring smalltown jealousy on the shoegazey Fuck Me Eyes and unfathomable
  loss on the skewed Americana of Nettles. The Black Keys – No Rain, No Flowers
  Out now Looking to mix things up on album 13, rock duo have turned to outside
  sources, bringing in Rick Nowels (Madonna, Lana Del Rey) and Scott Storch
  (Beyoncé, Dr Dre). The result is a richly melodic expansion on their bluesy
  garage rock sound. Craig David – Commitment Out now The enduring Southampton
  favourite returns with his ninth album, the follow-up to 2022’s 22. Featuring
  the likes of Tiwa Savage, 2015 X Factor winner Louisa Johnson and, on the
  gloriously schmaltzy ballad In it With You, JoJo, it also continues to explore
  David’s love of Ibiza dance-pop, on SOS. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food Mrs
  Robinson Sky Documentaries, 13 August Former UN high commissioner Mary
  Robinson is the focus of this incisive film charting her rise from practising
  law to becoming Ireland’s first female president and then prosecuting human
  rights abuses on the international stage. Essential Salt Podcast The Salt
  Institute for Documentary Studies presents a richly reported series of audio
  documentaries from its home state of Maine. Among the stories are explorations
  into land disputes and tensions between rural and urban inhabitants. Open
  Space YouTube Playing like a more comprehensive, academically rooted version
  of the Architectural Digest channel, Open Space presents in-depth visual tours
  of architectural wonders in the US, including works of 1940s modernism,
  Japanese-inspired bungalows and Frank Lloyd Wright masterpieces. Ammar Kalia
