  A three-minute brainwave test can detect memory problems linked to Alzheimer’s
  disease long before people are typically diagnosed, raising hopes that the
  approach could help identify those most likely to benefit from new drugs for
  the condition. In a small trial, the test flagged specific memory issues in
  people with mild cognitive impairment, highlighting who was at greater risk of
  developing Alzheimer’s. Trials in larger groups are under way. The Fastball
  test is a form of electroencephalogram (EEG) that uses small sensors on the
  scalp to record the brain’s electrical activity while people watch a stream of
  images on a screen. The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s
  automatic responses to images the person sees before the test. “This shows us
  that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for
  Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very
  high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive
  neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed. The
  trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52
  patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems
  with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to
  prevent them doing their daily activities. Before the test, volunteers were
  shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember
  them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the
  participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a
  screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture
  was one of the eight they had seen before. The scientists found that those
  with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had
  reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with
  non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to
  develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI. The test cannot
  identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger
  studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which
  patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs
  such as donanemab and lecanemab. All of the tests were performed in people’s
  homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and
  reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published in Brain Communications. Prof
  Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an
  early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step,
  he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition
  changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment. Dr Julia Dudley,
  of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring
  potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments
  are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease,
  therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.
  “Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find
  out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time.
  Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just
  dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence
  brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other
  diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”
