  Patients see doctors in a white coat as professional and trustworthy but often
  mistake a female medic wearing one for a nurse or medical assistant, a study
  has found. Female physicians are “unfairly judged based on appearance and
  attire, which affected patients’ perceptions of professionalism and
  competency”, according to a global review of the evidence around patients’
  impressions of what doctors wear. “Female physicians are often judged more on
  appearance than their male counterparts,” it said. “The way female physicians
  dress significantly influences perceptions of competence and professionalism,
  highlighting the gendered expectations that patients hold. “Even when male and
  female physicians wore identical attire, female physicians were still more
  likely to be misidentified as nurses or medical assistants.” The researchers
  found that “gender-related perceptions of physician attire” existed across the
  13 countries studied, including the US, India, Japan, China and Germany. The
  paper, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an analysis of 32
  previously published studies on perceptions of doctors’ clothing. “The
  expectations regarding attire are often gendered, particularly affecting the
  recognition and respect given to female physicians,” the paper’s co-authors
  write. Such behaviour is so widespread that hospitals and other healthcare
  providers should try to reduce bias among patients and “foster equitable
  perceptions” of male and female medics, they add. The white coat has been a
  symbol of medical expertise for decades. Its association in patients’ minds
  with cleanliness and professionalism meant that “white medical coats became
  the standard attire for physicians worldwide in the 20th century”. Until then,
  doctors had generally worn black clothing to reflect the seriousness of
  meetings with patients. People receiving healthcare find the white coat
  reassuring, the study found. “Regardless of gender, patients exhibited
  favourable attitudes towards physicians wearing white coats, perceiving the
  physicians as trustworthy, respectful, skilled, communicative and empathetic.”
  The white coat is still widely used by doctors worldwide. However, it was
  banned in the UK in 2008, when the government decided that medics working in
  the NHS should follow a “bare below the elbows” approach to reduce their risk
  of spreading infections. The British Medical Association was unsure that
  evidence justified the change. Despite patients’ preference for doctors
  wearing formal clothing, the Covid-19 pandemic made them more accepting of
  scrubs. “Patients tended to feel more comfortable with physicians wearing
  scrubs after Covid-19 ceased. While the traditional white coat is seen as a
  symbol of professionalism and trust, patients have increasingly accepted
  scrubs, especially in emergency or high-risk settings,” the researchers found.
  Globally, male doctors seem to enjoy another advantage in many patients’ minds
  as to what they wear. “Patients’ perceptions of male physicians’ accessories
  have shown that details such as watches and glasses significantly impact
  professionalism and trustworthiness” and add to their perceived authority, the
  study found.
