  A battle of the mind and a do-or-die showdown against Essendon stand between
  Gold Coast and a club-first AFL finals campaign. A Suns’ victory against the
  injury-ravaged Bombers already on a 12-match losing streak should be a mere
  formality if the stakes weren’t so high in the last game of the home-and-away
  season on Wednesday night. A 15th win of the year would be enough to lift the
  Suns from ninth spot and into the finals places, with either side of about a
  five-goal margin to decide whether they land in seventh or eighth. Western
  Bulldogs might be blessed to have a list stacked with top-end talent but for
  now are left holding out for a miracle that Gold Coast slip up for a third
  week running and let the Dogs hang on to a finals place instead. A top-eight
  spot is in the Suns’ hands, as it has been for several weeks. And was again
  when they were handed a harsh lesson on Friday about what can happen when a
  talented team freezes up and the opposition makes the most of their own free
  hit. Gold Coast had just as much to play for when they travelled to face
  another wounded side in Port Adelaide, with a chance to not only lock in the
  club’s breakthrough finals berth but also keep their hopes alive of securing a
  double chance. After a bright start, the Suns were lukewarm. The Power wanted
  it more. With their finals hopes long gone and a new era on the horizon, Port
  Adelaide played with the freedom of a side that had nothing to lose.
  Crucially, they also had their own motivations that went beyond end-of-season
  pride. The Power were charged with the emotion of wanting to send off coach
  Ken Hinkley and former captain Travis Boak in style. Ahead of finals sign up
  for our free weekly AFL newsletter The Bombers are unlikely to have similar
  intangibles to draw on when they seek to put a forgettable season behind them
  with an upset that would live long in the memory. They might have a couple of
  stalwarts moving on but they also have an injury list as long as this season
  has at times seemed. With banged-up veterans and mid-season punts dropped into
  their key posts, Essendon could not get the job done for the 12th week in a
  row even as they faced rivals Carlton in captain Zach Merrett’s 250th match.
  This week, with one foot already in the departure lounge, there is next to no
  expectation on the Bombers while all the pressure mounts on the slowly rising
  Suns. This has been a season of breaking hoodoos for Gold Coast. The club
  snapped its longest losing streak against an opposition team when beating
  Melbourne for the first time since 2014. They put a horror record on the road
  behind them by winning half their matches away from their Carrara and Darwin
  homes. They defeated the Lions for just the second time in 14 matches with
  their biggest winning margin, in what is now more importantly one of three
  victories this year over the eventual top-four sides. There are still more
  venues for the Suns to conquer and opposition sides to tear down but the
  opportunity for the 15-year-old club to reach the finals for the first time is
  suddenly the only record that matters now. The Suns arguably lacked maturity
  and melted under the pressure of the occasion as they blew the chance to
  secure a maiden top-eight finish with one game to play. They lost their run
  and dare from the back half and played too safe through the midfield when the
  match was on the line. The inspirational young skipper, Noah Anderson, came to
  life in the final term but even with all the momentum behind them in the dying
  stages the Suns fluffed their lines with a bigger stage in their sights. Ben
  Long has enjoyed a career-best season and Mac Andrew is a proven match-winner
  but both missed critical shots on goal at the death in a costly four-point
  thriller. Gold Coast’s coach, Damien Hardwick, said after the loss that he
  thought “the umpires got caught up in the emotion of the game”. He could have
  pointed the same finger of blame toward his own players for not being ruthless
  enough when they were on top early and too guarded when the Power challenged
  them late. The three-time premiership coach will surely be putting the heat on
  his Suns behind closed doors. Hardwick would be well within his rights to call
  back on his fiery statement last year that the club needs to “grow the fuck
  up”. After 15 years of mostly on-field failure and their fair share of misery,
  the time has arrived for the Suns to do just that. But as has been proven many
  times before, pressure and the burden of creating history can do strange
  things, without even thinking about carrying that weight and more into a 16th
  season.
