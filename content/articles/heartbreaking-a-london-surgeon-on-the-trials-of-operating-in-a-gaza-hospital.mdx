  hospital

  Every day between 4am and 6am, Graeme Groom, an orthopaedic surgeon from
  London, would be woken by a dawn chorus of bombs and missiles. And so began
  another 24 hours at the Nasser hospital in Gaza, the largest functioning
  hospital in the territory. Shortly after 8am, the first patients would be
  wheeled into the operating theatres. Groom and his orthopaedic and plastic
  surgery colleagues saw on average 20 patients a day: one-third children,
  one-third women, then men of all ages, their limbs mangled by bombs and guns.
  Groom, a co-founder of the charity Ideals that provides health services in
  places affected by conflict, has been to Gaza about 40 times, including four
  visits since Hamas militants attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. One evening on
  his most recent trip, just as the 12-hour-plus shift was ending, another
  emergency was wheeled in. It was an 11-year boy who had lost his nine siblings
  in an Israeli strike on their family home in Khan Younis. His father, a
  doctor, was in a critical condition, and later died of his injuries. That
  night Groom and his team managed to save the boy’s arm, rather than amputate
  it. The boy’s name was Adam al-Najjar. As Adam got better, the NHS doctor
  found that Adam spoke good English and had “the most angelic smile”, which
  could be prompted by a bar of chocolate from the surgeon’s pocket. A few weeks
  later Adam and his mother were evacuated to Italy. Physically, he was much
  better by the time he left, Groom said, although it was too early to assess
  the long-term impact of the explosion on his brain, or the mental scars. “We
  could not begin to get a mental health assessment of the effects of losing
  almost all his family in one bomb.” For every Palestinian child whose trauma
  captures headlines, there are thousands more whose stories go untold. The UN
  agency for children reported on 16 July that more than 17,000 children have
  been killed and 33,000 injured in the 21-month conflict. The NHS doctor
  recalls seven-year-old Yakub, who, with his older brother, was the only
  survivor of a bomb attack. Yakub’s legs had been broken above and below the
  knees, the skin and much soft tissue flayed by bombs. “While I was writing up
  the operation note … it was just heartbreaking to hear him calling for the
  mother who was dead.” He recalls two other patients: a mother who was cradling
  her three-year-old daughter when the bombs exploded. The child lost both legs,
  the mother’s elbows were damaged, depriving her of the use of her arms. She is
  now regaining the use of one arm. Patients are usually discharged to tents, or
  improvised shelters in the sand, without rehabilitation. They are
  malnourished, so wounds heal less well. Infection rates are high and it is
  hard to keep track of them for follow-up. But it is happening. “Amazing
  Palestinian colleagues are doing their very best … [and] without it, the
  mortality and the long-term disability rate would be much, much higher,” Groom
  said. The Ideals charity has been sending medical teams to the occupied
  Palestinian territories since 2009. But never before has it been so hard to
  bring in supplies. In the past Groom alone brought five large cases. On the
  most recent visit, his team was banned “under pain of exclusion, confiscation
  and possible penalty” from bringing desperately needed equipment such as
  delicate plastic surgery tools for repairing vein and tissue or orthopaedic
  frames that allow broken bones to heal. Since the Ideals team first went to
  Gaza there have always been damaged buildings, but “absolutely nothing to
  compare with the apocalyptic destruction that is everywhere” now. All his
  Palestinian colleagues have been forced to move, some many times. Many have
  lost close relatives, or most of their extended families. They live in tents
  near the hospitals with self-dug latrines for toilets. One woman slept in her
  hijab each night, “so that if she was killed, she would be presentable”, he
  recalled. “What was astonishing was how many of them would turn up for work
  each day from their tents … clean, well-dressed and smiling.” Several appeared
  to shrug off unimaginable personal suffering. “When they talked about the loss
  of family members … they would say ‘this is our lives’. I probably have heard
  that a dozen times,” Groom said of his Palestinian colleagues. Several have
  also told him they do not want to be known as resilient. They just want the
  bombing to stop, said Groom. At his most recent visit, from 13 May to 4 June,
  market stalls had almost disappeared. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian
  refugees, reported on Tuesday that doctors and nurses were among people
  “fainting from hunger and exhaustion”, having previously said Israeli
  authorities were “starving civilians”. On 20 July, an anaesthetist, who was
  also a parent to six children, told Groom that he and his family were
  starving. His children ranging from two to 13 are suffering from fatigue,
  weakness, cramps and amnesia. They were confused, they were crying, the
  anaesthetist said in messages to Groom seen by the Guardian. The anaesthetist
  could only give them salt to lick and water. Groom has relayed what he has
  witnessed in Gaza to policymakers in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, urging
  greater western pressure on Israel. “Everywhere we were met with empathy, very
  often with tears, but with a sense of impotence.” After he spoke to the
  Guardian, the European Commission proposed a partial suspension of Israel’s
  participation in the EU research programme, the first possible punitive
  measure against the Israeli government, which must be agreed by a majority of
  member states to take effect. Groom had been “hugely disappointed” when
  earlier this month EU foreign ministers took no action following a review into
  the bloc’s relations with Israel, “but I don’t think the fight is over”.
