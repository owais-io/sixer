  New data from the CDC suggests a grim back-to-school tradition emerging: in
  2024, kindergarten vaccination rates declined for the fifth consecutive year.
  Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions reached a record high. These statistics became
  all the more disturbing last fall when, shortly after 286,000 children began
  their educations without proof of full immunity against measles, a man who has
  bragged about never getting a flu shot was re-elected to the presidency. Since
  then, the US has contended with its largest measles outbreak in three decades,
  while the leaders who should be stamping out this crisis are instead fanning
  the flames. In just eight months, Trump and Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of
  the Department of Health and Human Services, have made every effort to
  undermine one of the major civilizing advances of the 20th century – our
  public health infrastructure. In doing so, they risk endangering millions of
  people and kickstarting a doom loop of mistrust from which it could take
  decades to recover. As usual, the Trump administration’s stance on vaccines is
  motivated less by sincere populism and more by personal profit. Before Kennedy
  launched his own presidential campaign on a platform of “making America
  healthy again”, he earned $20,000 every week helming a non-profit dedicated to
  fostering vaccine skepticism. Now in the cabinet, he has fired the entire CDC
  vaccine advisory panel and replaced them with a ragtag crew, half of whom have
  never published peer-reviewed research on vaccines. Just last week, Kennedy
  cancelled $500m of federal funding for mRNA vaccines, which prevented 14m
  deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. And he has made these rollbacks while
  retaining a financial stake in ongoing litigation against a vaccine
  manufacturer. All the while, the US has seen more than 1,300 measles cases and
  three deaths this year. In response, Kennedy has alternately endorsed and
  undermined the most effective method of prevention – widespread immunization.
  The evisceration of funding has extended across the sciences, with Trump
  cutting support for research to a 35-year nadir. At the National Institutes of
  Health, 1,800 grants have been terminated, a move that the Government
  Accountability Office deemed illegal. The administration also continues to
  freeze grants to universities over culture war phantasms like DEI, including
  $339m at UCLA and $2.2bn at Harvard. So it’s not surprising that 75% of US
  scientists polled by the journal Nature are considering leaving the country,
  which raises the prospect of a lost generation of American talent and
  lifesaving innovation. Internationally, Trump’s heartless and thoughtless
  budget cuts are causing devastation. The administration has dismantled USAID,
  one of the most successful preventers of contagious disease in history. In
  doing so, it defunded programs that vaccinated more than 800 million children
  against fatal illnesses like malaria. Researchers have found that 300,000
  people have already died because of these cuts, which could lead to another
  14m preventable deaths over the next five years – all to gut an agency that
  managed the equivalent of 4% of the annual national defense budget. Back in
  the US, medical associations, local officials and individual doctors are
  collaborating to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers and lobbying
  insurance companies to continue covering the costs of those shots. Their
  efforts reflect a tried-and-true strategy to counter under-immunization.
  Before the current outbreak, Ronald Reagan-era cuts to public health caused a
  more widespread measles pandemic, with 27,000 cases in just 1990. But locally
  led outreach campaigns and grassroots vaccination programs turned back the
  crisis, as did an eventual restoration of federal funds under Bill Clinton’s
  administration. Budget cuts can be reversed, but trust may be more difficult
  to recover. Long before RFK Jr’s ascendancy, disasters like the CDC’s infamous
  Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee and the Food and Drug Administration’s
  glacial response to the Aids crisis cast long shadows over public health
  institutions. Today, a plurality of Americans are already predicting they will
  lose faith in medical guidance under the current administration. That would
  undermine the very basis of public health, which depends on people choosing to
  follow guidelines grounded in research they did not personally conduct and
  whose results they are ill-trained to parse. Repairing that breach will
  require years of effortful relationship-building, but it might also require
  rallying Americans with the classic tactic of patriotism. For all of Trump’s
  bellicose rhetoric, he misses that our nation’s most extraordinary scientific
  and medical advances have drawn bipartisan enthusiasm in part because they
  reinforced a perceived American exceptionalism. At the height of the cold war,
  RFK Jr’s uncle chose to go to the moon, and Richard Nixon brought that dream
  to fulfilment. After Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded the National Foundation
  for Infantile Paralysis, Americans helped fund it by mailing in more than 2.5m
  dimes, hence its christening as the March of Dimes. That money supported Jonas
  Salk’s development of the polio vaccine. Within two years of its introduction,
  annual cases of polio had fallen by 90%. Even Trump, who botched the initial
  response to Covid-19, managed to oversee the historic Operation Warp Speed. If
  only he could recognize that this is the kind of achievement which makes
  America great.
