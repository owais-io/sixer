  Micah Parsons’ trade request Leave it to Jerry Jones to stink up the most
  optimistic time of year. The Cowboys owner has once again fumbled a contract
  negotiation with one of his stars. Despite fellow 2021 draftees Penei Sewell,
  Patrick Surtain II and Ja’Marr Chase signing long-term extensions, the Cowboys
  have allowed talks with Parsons to drag on. Last week, Parsons accused Jones
  of trying to circumvent his agent in negotiations and formally requested a
  trade. It’s fun to imagine Parsons on the trade block. What kind of haul could
  the Cowboys get in a trade? Three first-round picks? Two? Would the Bills make
  a move? The Rams? Is there a team that wouldn’t call? But let’s be clear:
  Parsons isn’t going anywhere. “It’s a negotiating tactic,” Jones said after
  Parsons’ request. For once, Jerry is right. Myles Garrett submitted a trade
  request to the Browns in February. A month later, he signed a $160m extension.
  In a league with the franchise tag, a public trade request is one of the only
  levers a player can pull in negotiations. Parsons is simply playing his part
  in the public charade. This shouldn’t be difficult. As a pass-rusher, Parsons
  is a one-man inferno. At times last season, he single-handedly bailed out
  Dallas’ defense. Oh, and he is just 26 years old, slap-bang in his prime.
  Negotiations should have been as simple as putting the biggest non-quarterback
  contract in league history on the table and popping the champagne. Yet Jones
  has spent the offseason taking odd shots at his best player, from questioning
  (incorrectly) Parsons’ injury history, to freezing his agent out of
  discussions, to debating why he would sign any player to a four or five-year
  contract. “You can get hit by a car, seriously,” Jones said at one point.
  Seriously. By allowing talks to drag on, the Cowboys have watched Parsons’
  value creep up. The edge-rushing market has ballooned this offseason, first
  with Garrett and then TJ Watt signing a massive extension. Last year, the
  Cowboys could have locked Parsons into a deal worth $34m a year. Now, the
  price will be closer to $42m. The Cowboys will eventually cave – as they
  always do. They’ll agree on a new deal on the eve of the new season, after
  lighting their training camp on fire and scoring Jones some headlines. JJ
  McCarthy The Vikings have a championship-caliber roster. They have elite skill
  players. They are loaded on both sides of the line of scrimmage. They have a
  top-five coaching staff. The only lingering question: their quarterback. How
  McCarthy slots into the Vikings’ offense is perhaps the most important
  variable in the championship race. The No 10 pick in the 2024 draft missed his
  rookie season with a knee injury, while Sam Darnold caught fire in relief –
  until he didn’t. Minnesota could have run it back with Darnold after a 14-win
  season, giving them a buffer to the McCarthy era. They didn’t. They bet on
  their infrastructure, allowing Darnold to walk and clearing the path for
  McCarthy. It’s a risk. Multiple playoff wins should be the expectation this
  year. And if McCarthy can be a solid starter in his debut season, the Vikings
  will have legitimate title aspirations. If you asked the computer to simulate
  the perfect circumstances for a first-year starter, it would probably produce
  something like what the Vikings offer. Head coach Kevin O’Connell has
  consistently produced high-wattage passing attacks, helping to generate easy
  chunk plays regardless of who is at quarterback. Justin Jefferson is the
  game’s best receiver, Jordan Addison is a solid second option and tight end TJ
  Hockenson is a difference-maker when healthy. Minnesota also spent the bulk of
  the offseason upgrading both lines, notably adding Ryan Kelly and Will Fries
  from the Colts on the offensive side, one of the craftiest interior line
  tandems in the league. If there were deficiencies last year, it was the team’s
  run game and conceding pressure up the middle. The new duo, along with rookie
  Donovan Jackson, should help patch over those issues. There were changes on
  defense, too. Brian Flores’ wackadoodle scheming carried the Vikings through
  tough stretches last season. This year, his unit is deeper and more explosive,
  with veterans Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave offering extra punch up front.
  The Vikings can now toggle between Flores’s bizarro looks and more basic
  set-ups, and should challenge the Eagles and Broncos to be the top defense in
  the league. If McCarthy does nothing but limit turnovers, the Vikings should
  keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. They will hope for more than that,
  but hammering away with the run game, hitting play-action shots and letting
  the defense feast is a viable path to the postseason. McCarthy thrived in that
  same environment at Michigan. If he plays with accuracy and keeps the offense
  churning, the Vikings will be a playoff force. The Browns’ quarterback circus
  What can you say about the Browns? There are banana republics with more stable
  leadership than Cleveland. It’s early August, so it’s not a full-scale
  disaster … yet. But the training camp reports make for grim reading. For a
  team in desperate need of a viable long-term starter, double-dipping on
  quarterbacks in the draft made sense. But the Browns now have a bloated
  quarterback competition, featuring 40-year-old Joe Flacco, a limping Kenny
  Pickett, and two underbaked rookies, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. No
  pressure, Kevin Stefanski (on Monday night, reports emerged they are signing
  another quarterback, Tyler Huntley, because all of the unit bar Flacco are
  carrying injuries). Flacco is the nominal starter, despite team owner Jimmy
  Haslam saying he expects to see both rookies play at some point this season.
  Gabriel has received a ton of practice reps with the first team, but the early
  returns have been scattershot at best. Cleveland may hold on to all four
  quarterbacks into the regular season, unless one of the rookies grabs the
  starting gig in preseason, freeing up the team to move on from Pickett or
  Flacco. Chucking rookie quarterbacks into the mayhem to figure out what you
  have sounds like a fine idea until they line up behind a depleted group.
  Whoever winds up as the starter will be playing with an ad hoc roster: the
  offensive line is a mixture of fossilized former Pro Bowlers and projects;
  there is a lack of reliable pass-catchers outside of Jerry Jeudy and David
  Njoku. If you’re looking for positives, watch the defense. The Browns have
  plenty of talent on that side of the ball, but even some of that has already
  been stripped away by injuries and a late retirement. It’s shaping up to be a
  messy year. Once, the Browns were fun upstarts. Now, they’re a depressing
  mystery again. If the team stumbles early, Stefanski could be out of a job by
  Thanksgiving. Miami temperature check Speaking of hot seats. Mike McDaniel’s
  seat in Miami is pretty toasty. After reaching the playoffs twice in
  McDaniel’s first two seasons, the Dolphins fell apart last season. They were
  undone by injuries again, only this time it was the defense that
  disintegrated. They did little in the offseason to fill you with confidence.
  Terron Armstead, the team’s franchise left tackle, retired. The offensive line
  still looks rickety. Jalen Ramsey was traded. Tyreek Hill kept up his
  on-again, off-again relationship with a trade request, although now he’s
  committed to studying. Miami’s offense will continue to produce fireworks,
  thanks largely to McDaniel, Hill, Tua Tagovailoa, Jaylen Waddle and De’Von
  Achane. And on paper, at least, the Dolphins have one of the most talented
  defensive front-sevens in the sport. Jaelen Phillips, Bradley Chubb, Zach
  Sieler, Chop Robinson and Kenneth Grant could form one of the nastiest
  pass-rushes in the league. Still, the balance of the remaining roster is
  dicey. Heading into the season, Miami’s secondary is the flakiest position
  group in the league. Acquiring Minkah Fitzpatrick in the Ramsey trade will
  help, but he is the group’s only proven starter. They already lost their top
  cornerback, Kader Kohou, for the season with a knee injury. Miami brought in
  Mike Hilton from the scrapheap to replace Kohou and will rely on Ifeatu
  Melifonwu and Ashtyn Davis, two safeties with shaky injury records, to play
  alongside Fitzpatrick. Storm Duck, currently slated to start, was a fun story
  a year ago as an undrafted free agent, but he was torched in meaningful snaps
  as a rookie. You know you’re in trouble when Jack Jones, a fringe starter,
  goes from unemployed to a team’s premier corner in 10 days. The hope is that
  the team’s pass-rush will be so overwhelming that it can mitigate the impact
  of the secondary. But, at some point, it will be third-and-medium and someone
  in the secondary will need to make a play. Only Fitzpatrick is a dynamic
  playmaker, and he is on the downside of his career. The Dolphins haven’t won a
  playoff game since 2000. If they miss the postseason again, McDaniel will
  probably be out. And the current roster has too many holes to be a serious
  threat to the Bills in the East. The NFC West’s logjam Take a look at the NFC
  West. It’s stacked, comfortably the most competitive division in the league.
  The Rams came close to bouncing the Eagles in the playoffs last season with a
  young roster and have reloaded this year. The Niners remade their defense
  after last season’s injury apocalypse. The Cardinals are no longer just an
  interesting side show; they have a bruising offense and a spicy defense. The
  Seahawks closed last season strong, putting together a top-five defense from
  Week 10 onwards, and could have one of the best units in the league this
  season. There are no slouches. The weakest single unit in the division may be
  the Seahawks’ offense, and that could still crack the top half of the league.
  How the division shakes out will probably come down to how quickly Darnold can
  assimilate in Seattle. Was his career-best year in Minnesota a mirage? Will
  his talented but unproven offensive line hold up? Can a receiver room of
  Cooper Kupp, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Jaxon Smith-Njigba offset the losses
  of DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett? As ever, there are also the annual concerns
  about Matthew Stafford’s injury status to throw into the NFC mix. But if
  Darnold’s resurgence carries over and Stafford is healthy, then all four teams
  will have quality starting quarterbacks and spiky defenses. It’s going to be a
  bloodbath. Aaron Rodgers’ last dance Buckle up, folks. You have one more
  season of Rodgers to deal with. Yes, Rodgers in Pittsburgh could be a farce.
  It probably will be a farce. The Steelers’ decision to sign a 41-year-old
  Rodgers, who is two years removed from an achilles injury, after Pittsburgh
  *deep breath* traded for DK Metcalf, signed the receiver to a bumper
  extension, traded away George Pickens, benched Justin Fields for Russell
  Wilson, then told Fields that he was Their Guy, then told Wilson to take the
  first plane out of town, then lost Fields in free agency, then traded for
  Jalen Ramsey, then signed TJ Watt to a market-resetting extension is the kind
  of teenager-on-Madden approach to team-building usually reserved for the
  Jaguars, Panthers or the son of a Jets owner. It is weird to reach this point:
  somehow, the vaunted Steelers have become the league’s most directionless
  franchise. But the Steelers are convinced they have the backbone of a
  championship contender. “We’re building this team to win a Super Bowl this
  year,” GM Omar Khan said recently. It’s easy to chuckle at the Steelers
  assembling a 2022 All-Pro squad (hand up). But there’s a path to at least
  division contention here. If Ramsey is even 70% of the player he was in his
  prime, he will be a linchpin on an already outstanding defense. Whether the
  offense can match the defense will come down to Rodgers’ connection with
  offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, two stubborn offensive designers with
  divergent styles. Rodgers probably won’t guide the Steelers to a Super Bowl.
  He looked a shadow of himself last season: hesitant to stand in the pocket,
  worried about getting hit, unable to avoid the rush as his accuracy dwindled
  to key parts of the field. But if Rodgers can stay healthy, he could perhaps
  Peyton Manning his way through a final season, keeping the Steelers
  competitive as they try to bridge one team to the next. If the on-field stuff
  turns out to be a disaster, his lasting legacy in Pittsburgh may be convincing
  Mike Tomlin that more substantive changes are needed.
