  It may be only the second week of the Rugby World Cup but it is win or bust
  for so many teams this weekend and few games have that feeling more than the
  USA’s showdown with Australia in York on Saturday evening. In many ways, this
  is the game of the round: and perhaps the tournament so far. The two sides
  began in contrasting fashion but there were few surprises in that regard, with
  Australia racking up a record score in defeating Samoa and the United States
  coming up short against tournament favourites and hosts England on the opening
  night. Victory for the Wallaroos in York would guarantee qualification with a
  round to go, assuming England defeat Samoa on Saturday. In the Pacific Four
  series this year, Australia ran out winners by 27-19 and on paper at least
  would be considered favourites to progress. But while a performance similar to
  last weekend’s opener would be satisfying , head coach Jo Yapp is clear about
  the one thing which matters above all else. “The difference this week is it’s
  all about the win,” she said. “If it’s not pretty, that’s OK, but it’s about
  getting the win this week and we know that.” Yapp will still be without
  captain Siokapesi Palu due to a foot problem that kept her out on the opening
  weekend, with the Wallaroos making four changes to the 23 that defeated Samoa
  so handsomely in Salford. But the second-rower Michaela Leonard will retain
  her place and make her 40th Test appearance for Australia, becoming only the
  third player to hit that landmark. “She’s just a really professional athlete
  in her approach to everything,” Yapp said. “That has then allowed her to
  achieve what she’s achieving this weekend.” While Australia are looking for
  much of the same again on Saturday, for the USA, they are already in
  now-or-never territory. Defeat by England was hardly a surprise but it was
  always going to inevitably pile the pressure on this fixture, which had been
  earmarked by everyone as an early knockout fixture. The winner of this game
  most likely qualifies for the quarter-finals. That is a point clearly not lost
  on the USA coach, Sione Fukofuka. He has made a staggering nine changes to the
  side that were beaten by England with a big-name omission too, as the centre
  and veteran of three Olympics Alev Kelter is dropped from the 23 entirely.
  “There were always going to be some changes,” Fukofuka said in the run-up to
  the game. “If we perform well, get the result, we’ll earn ourselves the
  opportunity to play beyond the pool stages. Obviously it’s a must-win game so
  we’ve got to try and make some clear decisions around our opposition so there
  was a bit of a plan in place and then obviously some injuries.” Emily Henrich
  will move in from the wing to replace Kelter and partner Ilona Maher in the
  centres with Cheta Emba and Erica Coulibaly on the flanks. With the prospect
  of Samoa in the final round of fixtures next weekend, the USA know that if
  they can raise their game in York on Saturday, qualification will be within
  their grasp. Lose, however, and their World Cup journey will be over before it
  has even really begun. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Wales are also in last
  chance saloon to make their mark on this tournament. Substantive changes to
  the lineup for their match in Salford against Canada on Saturday are a
  last-ditch effort to try and salvage their hopes, barely a week into the
  tournament for a team that reached the last eight in New Zealand at the last
  World Cup. A devastating 38-8 loss to Scotland – who were ranked lower than
  them at the time – has left their hopes hanging by a thread, effectively
  needing to upset second-ranked Canada in order to have a realistic chance of
  progress to the knockout stages. The Wales coach, Sean Lynn, has reshuffled
  his lineup with seven changes to try to keep their hopes alive with Scotland
  fancied to beat outsiders Fiji in Saturday’s second game at the Salford
  Community Stadium in Pool B. “All 23 players selected have been told to be
  brave and to have no regrets when they walk off the field on Saturday,” said
  Lynn. Wales had already lost co-captains Alex Callender and Kate Williams to
  injury suffered against the Scots, meaning flanker Bethan Lewis captains for
  the first time as she wins her 60th cap. Ireland’s head coach, Scott Bemand,
  has also made several changes to his starting XV for Sunday’s match against
  Spain in Northampton. Molly Scuffil-McCabe replaces Aoibheann Reilly at
  scrum-half, while Anna McGann is preferred to Beibhinn Parsons on the right
  wing. Loosehead prop Ellena Perry, hooker Cliodhna Moloney-MacDonald, lock
  Eimear Corri-Fallon, openside flanker Claire Boles and No 8 Grace Moore come
  into the pack but star player Aoife Wafer is still not fully fit to begin her
  campaign. Bemand’s side launched their Pool C campaign with a 42-14 success
  over Japan and will secure qualification for the quarter-finals with a second
  successive bonus-point win at Franklin’s Gardens. Ireland conclude the pool
  stage on 7 September against defending champions New Zealand in Brighton.
