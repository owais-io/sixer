  Donald Trump’s decision to extend a truce in the trade war with China for
  another 90 days triggered a stock market rally across the globe on Tuesday.
  The US president signed an executive order on Monday night extending the
  deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10 November and avoiding a rates
  cliff edge. Beijing responded the following morning that it would suspend
  additional tariffs on US goods for a further 90 days. Trump had previously
  threatened to put tariff rates as high as 245% on Chinese imports into the US
  after the deadline passed, while Beijing had threatened retaliatory tariffs of
  125%. In response to the reprieve, markets in Japan and Australia hit record
  highs on Tuesday, as expectations grew that Washington and Beijing could
  secure a trade agreement during the fresh hiatus, which extends current
  baseline rates of 30% on Chinese goods into the US and 10% on American
  products going the other way. Tokyo’s Nikkei share index rose 2.5% to
  42,867.69 points on Tuesday, while the Australian ASX 200 index closed up
  0.41%, to a new high of 8,880. Its momentum was helped by the Reserve Bank of
  Australia cutting its main interest rate to a two-year low of 3.6%. In China,
  the Shanghai composite index rose by 0.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index
  remained broadly flat. Stock markets in Europe also opened higher on Tuesday
  morning. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip multinationals closed up
  0.2% while the French Cac 40 rose 0.5%. US markets were also up, helped by
  better-than-expected inflation data. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.9% in early
  trading and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago, while the
  Dow was up 1% and the tech-focused Nasdaq climbed 1.1% and was also heading
  toward a record. Economists have warned that Trump’s trade war regime,
  especially against China, could seriously damage the global economic outlook,
  as it could lead to higher costs, disrupt supply chains and reduce
  international trade. Mark Haefele, of the Swiss bank UBS, said the trade truce
  represented “an encouraging step toward finding an agreement between
  Washington and Beijing that would avoid a significant disruption in global
  trade flows”. “We think the additional time could yield concessions from both
  sides on several unresolved issues, including fentanyl flows, rare-earth
  controls, tech export curbs, and Russian oil purchase,” he said. Oil prices
  also rose on Tuesday amid hopes the trade war could de-escalate. Brent crude
  futures rose by 0.4% to $66.90 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate
  crude futures rose by 0.4% to $64.20.
