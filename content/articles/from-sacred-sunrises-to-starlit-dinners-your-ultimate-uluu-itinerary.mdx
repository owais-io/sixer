  As the sun rises over Uluṟu, adventure stirs. Desert flora still cloaked in
  the night. A symphony of bird calls. The kaleidoscopic rock shifting through
  orange to flame-red. In this ancient rusted landscape, you only need two
  words: “Just wow.” From the first minute of each day until ink-blue expands
  across the starlit sky, Uluṟu offers an experience like no other. Here,
  adventure just happens, and it looks a little different for everyone.
  Profoundly intimate. Deeply enriching. Transformative and authentic. It’s no
  wonder Uluṟu is on your bucket list. Every day is a chance for adventure.
  Isn’t it time for yours to start? Connect to country with an Uluṟu sunrise
  Start your first day with art. Sunrise Journeys was created in partnership
  with Aṉangu to share modern stories of their connection to country through a
  distinctly female lens. It’s pre-dawn. Red hues kiss the sky as an expansive
  artwork by three Aṉangu women comes to life with light projections on the
  desert landscape. Supported by narration in Pitjantjatjara and English
  delivered by the artists themselves, and a bespoke musical score by the Aṉangu
  musician Jeremy Whiskey, the experience brings to life the depth of knowledge
  Aṉangu hold to survive and thrive in this environment. Enjoy quiet,
  contemplative time to witness nature’s most spectacular show – a sunrise at
  Uluṟu – before breakfast is served. Think emu quiche, quandong pudding, smoked
  kangaroo and bush tomato relish. Enjoy cultural storytelling at new heights
  Storytelling is ancient in Uluṟu. Since the beginning, Aṉangu have walked and
  shared through spoken word, art and ceremonies. Now, there’s a new way to
  listen. Settle into an evening with Wintjiri Wiṟu, which Ayers Rock Resort
  Uluṟu claims is the world’s largest daily drone show. The winner of multiple
  awards, the show has audiences gasping as they take in the Mala Tjukurpa, the
  Aṉangu creation story, told through 1200 drones dancing in the night sky.
  Uluṟu is much more than its breathtaking beauty. These stories and history are
  sacred to the Aṉangu, and Ayers Rock Resort, Uluṟu, aims to promote cultural
  tourism that works with communities and minimises impact on the land. The show
  was co-created with the 10 senior Aṉangu who comprise the Wintjiri Wiṟu
  Working Group, and you’ll hear narration in Pitjantjatjara as well as
  traditional Inma (songs). You’ll also enjoy some curated bites featuring local
  flavours such as gin-soaked cucumber topped with green ants, and crocodile
  pie. Fine dining in the shadow of an ancient monolith As the sun sets on
  another Uluṟu day, discover world-class degustation-style dining with an
  unbelievable backdrop. Tali Wiṟu – meaning “beautiful dune” in the Aṉangu
  language – is an Australian Good Food Guide hatted restaurant, and the guide’s
  highest rated restaurant in the Northern Territory. It’s local. It’s
  delicious. And it’s served with the deftness of fine dining. This is an
  intimate affair. Take your seat at a remote open-air restaurant alongside only
  19 others. You’ll have views through the desert to Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa, and
  four courses to nourish your body and soul. We’re talking Shark Bay scallops,
  Glacier 51 toothfish, bush spinach dumplings and wagyu fillet – all infused
  with the finest native ingredients and paired with premium Penfolds wine for
  the ultimate foodie experience. Did you notice the enthusiastic young folk who
  helped make your stay so perfect? The National Indigenous Training Academy
  operates at Ayers Rock Resort, Uluṟu. It’s an important pathway to employment,
  having helped more than 750 young Indigenous students to join the workforce,
  so even more people can go “Just wow” like you did. Be sure to stop in for a
  coffee at the Kuḻaṯa Academy Cafe, a real work environment for trainees, who
  are living, learning and earning on site. You’ve heard ancient stories. Been
  enriched by Aṉangu culture. Enjoyed authentic native ingredients. And every
  experience has shown deep respect for this place, culture and sustaining
  Uluṟu’s breathtaking beauty for generations to come. The sun is setting on
  this country once more, but your new perspective has already transformed you.
  Tick the big one off your bucket list. Book a holiday that’s Just WOW, right
  now.
