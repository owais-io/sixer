  The Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, put its
  namesake digital tokens up for sale on Monday, adding some $5bn in paper value
  to Donald Trump’s family fortune. The token, known as $WLFI, fell in value on
  Monday in their first day of trading. The World Liberty tokens were sold to
  investors after the Trump family and its business partners last year launched
  the venture, a decentralized finance platform that has also issued a
  stablecoin, a cryptocurrency meant to maintain a specific price by tying its
  value to a specific asset. Investors in the tokens voted in July to make them
  tradable, paving the way for their sale and purchase – and potentially
  boosting the value of the president’s holdings of them. Early investors can
  sell up to 20% of their holdings, World Liberty has said. The tokens initially
  traded above $0.30 in their Monday debut but later fell in price to $0.20. Per
  data from CoinMarketCap, roughly $1bn worth of the tokens changed hands within
  the first hour of the opening of trading. That gave the token a total market
  capitalisation of just below $7bn, making WLFI the 31st largest crypto token
  in circulation, according to data from trading analysis firm CoinGecko.
  Several of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance,
  OKX and Bybit, are offering $WLFI tokens on their platforms. Since World
  Liberty’s launch last year, the Trump family has made around $500m from the
  project, according to Reuters calculations based on the company’s terms and
  conditions, transactions traced by crypto analysis firms, and publicly
  disclosed deals. Ownership of roughly a quarter of World Liberty’s tokens has
  added roughly $5bn to the Trump family fortune, according to the Wall Street
  Journal. Trump himself, referred to as a “co-founder emeritus” on the
  company’s website, owns an unspecified amount of $WLFI, but he is barred from
  selling them, as are other members of the team, including his sons, according
  to World Liberty. Trump has used the Oval Office to expand crypto-friendly
  regulations in the US. The tokens were not made tradable at their initial
  sale. Instead, they gave holders the right to vote on some changes to the
  business, such as its underlying code. Early investors have said the primary
  draw of $WLFI was the connection to Trump and their expectations that the
  tokens would grow in value due to his backing. Making the tokens tradable
  allows investors to determine their price, enabling speculation, earning
  trading fees for exchanges that list them, and likely stoking interest from a
  wider swath of crypto investors than when they were merely privately
  available. World Liberty and Trump’s other crypto businesses have faced
  criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government ethics experts who say the
  Trump family’s forays into the cryptocurrency businesses, at the same time as
  the president reshapes the regulatory framework that governs digital
  currencies, represent profound conflicts of interest. The White House has said
  repeatedly that Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children and that
  there are no conflicts of interest.
