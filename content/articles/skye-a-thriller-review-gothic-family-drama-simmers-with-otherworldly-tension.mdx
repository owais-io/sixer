  Skye: A Thriller review – gothic family drama simmers with otherworldly
  tension
sectionName: Stage

  It starts with a shriek. A deliberate false alarm, this sets the spooky tone
  of Ellie Keel’s two-hander – a playwriting debut to add to a career that
  already includes novel writing, theatre producing and the co-founding of the
  Women’s prize for playwriting. If Skye: A Thriller has more narrative drive
  than dramatic purpose, it is no less a confident and absorbing debut. It stars
  Dawn Steele as Annie, a shell-shocked and determined woman trying to piece
  together her memories of an unfortunate family past, bound up in an August
  1995 holiday on the island of Skye, where the mist rolls down from the Cullin
  hills to give a suitably ghostly atmosphere. James Robinson is on hand as a
  documentary producer filming her recollections – projected on a screen in
  closeup in Matthew Iliffe’s production – and also to play brother Brawn and
  other male parts as the story unfolds. It is the story of a young family not
  quite reconciled to the death in a car accident of their father four years
  earlier. The shock of his sudden loss makes it all too easy for little brother
  Sammy to think he has spotted him across the beach – and for the siblings not
  to dismiss their eight-year-old brother out of hand. Coincidence? Conspiracy?
  Ghost? None of the options are palatable and it only takes a silvery speeding
  car with no apparent driver to ratchet up the otherworldly tension. The more
  that the circumstantial evidence mounts up, the more frantic the search and
  the more dangerous the efforts to get to the truth. In this rural tale, it is
  a sheep that goes bump in the night. The weather is as unforgiving as in any
  gothic chiller, but it is the rush to believe in the supernatural that leads
  to the real tragedy. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our
