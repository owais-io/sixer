  Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Card (Representative 53.3% APR Variable,
  Annual fee applies, 18+, Subject to status, terms and conditions apply) A city
  break is perfect for a short, sharp shot of culture. It’s brief enough that
  nobody needs to ask for too much annual leave and long enough to be a
  refreshing getaway. With limited time, you want to make sure you get the most
  out of it – and because of that a little planning can go a long way. I’ve
  spent 20 years writing about travel, and city breaks are one of my favourite
  types of trip. Here are a few tips I’ve picked up along the way. 1 Pack like a
  pro I tend to travel with hand luggage only so I can step straight off the
  plane and hop easily on to my chosen mode of transport into the city. There
  are three things I never travel without: a power bank for my phone, because
  maps, translator apps and taking endless photos all drain my battery pretty
  quickly; a light rucksack that packs flat in my cabin bag on the way out but
  gives me extra space for souvenirs on the way back (check your airline allows
  an additional small bag); I also find a light scarf has a multitude of uses –
  I’ve used mine as a towel after an impromptu swim in Copenhagen’s harbour, as
  well as to cover summer shoulders when visiting churches in Rome. With the
  latter in mind, it pays to do a little research ahead of time to check
  cultural sensitivities – it also helps make sure you pack for any extra
  adventures you may end up adding to the museum visits and meals out. And
  before you head off to the airport, it always pays to do a final check that
  you’ve packed the essentials before you leave the house: your (in-date)
  passport, phone and credit cards. Speaking of which, it’s worth considering
  rewards cards that could help you get the most out of a trip. With the
  Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card you can earn while you’re exploring –
  Cardmembers earn two Marriott Bonvoy® points for every £1 spent on the Card,
  and a generous six points for every £1 spent at hotels participating in
  Marriott Bonvoy, which can be redeemed on future stays. All of which means you
  can enjoy your holiday to the full while gathering points for your next one.
  Plus, you may be eligible for a Free Night Award, depending on how much you
  spend throughout the year. 2 Think about your luggage A wheeled suitcase in
  cabin bag size is generally the easiest option – although each airline has its
  own spec, so always do a quick check on the airline website. If you’re looking
  to buy a new bag, you could consider a suitcase with shoulder straps, which
  doubles as a rucksack. Mine has helped me no end when crossing picturesque,
  cobbled old towns to find my accommodation. And if you have hours to kill
  before your return flight and nowhere to leave your luggage, there is a
  proliferation of luggage storage options. There are several apps that are
  ready to point you to shops and businesses that will look after your case for
  just a few pounds. 3 Don’t try to do everything Remember, less is very often
  more. It can be tempting to pack your itinerary with things to see. After all,
  time is short and there’s that great new exhibition on, and a friend said you
  absolutely had to visit that market. But then you find yourself lingering over
  coffee and suddenly you have to dash across the city to get to your next
  sight. So make a plan for those must-see spots, keeping a couple of ideas in
  reserve as a “nice to see” if you have time. Try to visit things that are
  geographically close on the same day. And remember, some key sights get booked
  up months in advance. So if you want to go to the Alhambra in Granada or visit
  the Vatican in Rome, try to book well ahead online so you have your visit
  secured. Remember, too, that after a busy few days of sightseeing, it can be a
  good idea to factor in some downtime before your holiday ends. The Marriott
  Bonvoy American Express Card includes automatic Marriott Bonvoy® Silver Elite
  status, which features perks such as Priority Late Checkout (subject to
  availability), so you can take it easy with a relaxing start on your last day.
  4 Make time to go local The most rewarding travel experiences often come when
  we immerse ourselves in the daily life of the city. I’ve found fabulous coffee
  spots when strolling through neighbourhoods, and nothing beats a market for
  picking up local produce and enjoying a makeshift picnic in a nearby park. A
  chat with staff at bars and cafes can reveal some hidden spots, so ask them
  where they like to go. And look out for event posters. I ended up at the most
  authentic flamenco performance at a bar down a tiny street in Seville when I
  spotted an advert pasted on a lamppost. A little research online can also help
  pinpoint where the locals are hanging out. I use translation apps to search in
  the target language. 5 Eat the streets Cuisine is a veritable gateway to the
  heart of a destination and it doesn’t have to be fancy. Street food is a great
  way to eat on the go while experiencing the authentic flavours of your
  destination. Pick up a sweet, sumptuous pastel de nata in Lisbon, or
  portafoglio – a folded “wallet pizza” – in Naples. In Malta’s capital,
  Valletta, pastizzi are flaky pastry pockets filled with ricotta cheese or
  peas, while the morning after the night before in Madrid is perked up with
  crunchy deep-fried churros dipped in chocolate. Or, if you’d prefer to wind
  down after a busy day of excursions, you don’t need to go far. If you’re
  staying with Marriott Bonvoy, you can book in for a relaxing evening with
  dinner at your hotel, helping you to feel refreshed for the next day’s
  adventure. And if you have a Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card, you can
  redeem your points on dining-in. Finally, I always make sure to reserve one
  great local foodie experience before I travel. If it’s popular, you’re
  unlikely to be able to walk in off the street. On a recent trip to Athens, it
  was Fita, a tiny spot with the freshest local ingredients that a Greek friend
  had recommended. By reserving a table at that of-the-moment trattoria or
  trending cocktail bar, you’ll know you have one fancy night out and the rest
  of your meals can be left to enjoy in a more relaxed and spontaneous way. How
  does the Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card work? For every £1 you spend on
  your Card, you’ll receive two Marriott Bonvoy® points. If you’re using your
  Card at a hotel participating in Marriott Bonvoy, you’ll receive six points
  per eligible £1 spent. Points can then be redeemed to explore 9,500 properties
  across more than 30 leading brands in 144 countries and territories, and on
  more than 150 airlines. The Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card is also well
  suited to regular travellers. All Cardmembers start with Silver Elite status,
  and they are eligible for a Free Night Award after spending £25,000 in a year.
