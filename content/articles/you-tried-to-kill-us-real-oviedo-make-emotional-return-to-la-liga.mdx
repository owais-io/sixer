  “When the players went out, they were like ‘pfff, what a great atmosphere’,”
  Xabi Alonso said at the close of a night so long-awaited many didn’t make it,
  and many of those who did were actually experiencing primera for the first
  time. At the north end of the Carlos Tartiere, Real Oviedo’s fans prepared to
  reveal another gigantic work of art, 1,800 square metres of tifo sent tumbling
  across the terrace. Beneath the west stand, the city’s bagpipers got ready to
  play the Asturian anthem. Near the tunnel, Elena and Carlos, the embodiment of
  an entire generation, waited to kick it all off. And everywhere, in the city
  and the stadium, there was blue. Into it all, Real Madrid stepped on Sunday
  night. And, their manager said, it was “spectacular”. They had missed it. The
  last time Madrid had been to Oviedo was 10 June 2001, the last first division
  game in the Tartiere. That day, a fortnight after Oviedo had beaten Barcelona
  at the Camp Nou, they drew 1-1 with Vicente del Bosque’s side, Santi Solari
  scoring. “I prefer to forget it,” Veljko Paunovic says, but he can’t. “We
  missed so many chances; I had two, one hit the bar.” A win and Oviedo would
  have been safe; instead, seven days later they lost 4-2 at Mallorca and were
  relegated. It took 24 years to return to primera, nine days more to do so at
  home. Coincidence, or perhaps a kind of closure, decided it would be against
  the same team as the last time, 8,841 days later. Another 168 teams have been
  there since, many of whom you probably haven’t heard of, all of which Oviedo
  can now be proud of: Pumarín, Atlético Astorga, Colloto. Montañeros, Condal de
  Noreña, Real Titánico. Or tiny CD Mosconia, even though there may be no goal
  that meant as much as the one Kily Álvarez scored against them. When Madrid
  last came, Paunovic was an Oviedo midfielder; now he is the manager, the man
  who won promotion to primera in June, immediately messaging the teammates who
  went down with him in 2001. “It’s been very emotional,” he said, “this is like
  closing a circle, repaying a debt. It transcends football.” Fans overlooking
  the Carlos Tartiere Stadium. Flares are lit as supporters descend on the
  ground. Arriving ahead of kick-off for the club’s first top-flight match in 24
  years. Walking into the stadium. Football always does, and on Sunday night it
  was felt, even by Madrid’s players. This is not just once-big team gets
  relegated and takes too long to return, so long that loads of the Oviedo fans
  who sang about doing so never saw them play in primera in the first place and
  countless more didn’t live to see it happen. It is not that Oviedo fell in
  2001, it is that they kept falling. Not just that they are in the first
  division now but that they are, not just that they might not have made it back
  but that they might not have made it at all. The last time they faced Madrid
  was against their C team. And it might have been the last time they ever faced
  anyone. Before this weekend’s game Oviedo produced a matchday poster that
  portrayed the two teams as old acquaintances crossing paths again. “Tell me,
  how’s it been going … ” the message says. At the top of the image, Real Madrid
  lift another European Cup. At the bottom, Real Oviedo’s former goalkeeper Rafa
  Ponzo stands in the mud. Since 2001, while Oviedo have been away, Madrid have
  won 11 leagues and seven Champions Leagues. Oviedo have been down to the
  second division, second division b – an 82-team league of four regional
  divisions – and tercera, where there are more than 350 teams across 17
  divisions. They have been relegated two divisions in the same season, had an
  owner on the run from Interpol and politicians trying to kill them off. Twice
  they were on the verge of folding, gone for ever. Which was when the fans came
  in, and which is why this was much more than just a promotion, a first
  division homecoming. Instead of coming back up after relegation in 2001, they
  went down again two years on, from the second division to the second division
  b. Worse, debts spiralled, reaching 7bn pesetas (€42m), the list of creditors
  headed by the tax office, Betis, bank, and social security. When players
  reported the club for unpaid salaries, an extra division was added to their
  fall, sent down to tercera. They also started the following season on
  minus-six points. If they started it at all. The headline in one local paper
  said it all. “It’s over.” “All that’s left is to sign the death certificate,”
  said the local mayor, Gabino de Lorenzo, and he was keen to do that. “Given
  the imminent disappearance of professional football in the city, de jure and
  de facto,” a draft agreement began, the council invited the local amateur club
  Astur to take their place. Astur changed their name to Oviedo ACF, their
  colours to Oviedo’s colours, their badge to something near-identical to
  Oviedo’s. They signed Oviedo’s record appearance maker. The council promised
  Astur a €91,000 subsidy and the use of the Tartiere. Newspapers in the mayor’s
  pocket backed the project, talked up full houses that weren’t full and popular
  support that didn’t exist, something tin-pot dictator in the tone. Sample
  line: “Gabino received an improvised homage with a huge ovation when he
  arrived at the ground”. Bagpipers play the Asturian anthem before the match. A
  proud supporter. A huge tifo unfurled before kick-off. Passion in the stands.
  As it turned out, it was what Oviedo needed – something to go to war for, a
  cause to defend, anger to fuel it, an enemy to take on. “The poison cured
  you,” as one Oviedo song goes. Astur were the clone, the freak; Real Oviedo
  were the real Oviedo, and there was a reawakening, a rebellion. Led by
  president Manolo Lafuente fans answered the call: they brought generators, cut
  grass, painted stands, and started calling season ticket holders one by one,
  putting together homemade membership cards. Eventually there were 11,700 of
  them. In their entire time down in what they came to call the “mud” – a word
  used metaphorically and literally – Oviedo never had less than 10,000. They
  built a team too, with a skeleton staff, only six of 40 remaining. The entire
  squad had gone. So had youth players Juan Mata, Santi Cazorla and Adrián
  López, forced out amid the chaos. They had no hot water, no electricity and no
  players but within two weeks they had a team and it was theirs, an identity
  forged, a sense of belonging. It was precarious but they played, starting with
  that win over CD Mosconia, and they were proud. Defeated, the city council
  eventually quietly dropped Astur. Then it went wrong again. A new owner
  arrived in 2006, an apparent saviour. Wanted for two counts of fraud, Alberto
  González went missing. In 2012 Oviedo were again on the verge of folding. An
  interim board – heroes all – had a plan, one last roll of the dice. Again fans
  rose, backed this time by supporters from around the world. An SOS went out
  and they responded. In the midst of it, Oviedo played Real Madrid C. That day
  thousands marched to the ground. 20,500 were at the game, in the third tier.
  Real Madrid C’s players brought shares. Their club underwrote €100,000 worth.
  In two weeks, 36,962 people in 86 countries had brought shares. Watching the
  phenomenon spread, the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim brought shares, taking
  Oviedo over the threshold, its future secured. In 2022, some of those were
  sold to the Pachuca group. In 2003, as it left Oviedo to die, the city council
  had declared that the Astur project would “return football in Oviedo to the
  place it deserves to be”; 22 years on, 24 years after they departed the top
  flight, it happened: not the way they wanted, but the way everyone else did.
  Sprinting on to the pitch was Cazorla who had been forced out by the crisis
  and finally played his first game for his boyhood club at 38, then took them
  to primera at 40. On local radio Miguel Fernandi, the voice of Oviedo through
  the muddy years, met the playoff final whistle with: “You tried to kill us,
  you tried to assassinate us, you tried to replace us, and 24 years later,
  we’re in primera.” Where, on Sunday night, they lost 3-0 against Real Madrid.
  Where they were always likely to but might not have done, but for Kwasi Sibo’s
  shot coming off a post in the 81st minute with the score at 1-0. “I was so mad
  at myself; it matters to me personally and everyone else,” he said. But where
  it wasn’t really about that; it was about the journey, about being. About this
  division not just being a place to play but a statement, meeting Madrid not
  just a match but a symbol: of survival, of overcoming, of never having
  abandoned, reclaiming a place. About knowing where you come from, about
  winning. Not a match or even a promotion, not really, but something more: an
  identity, meaning. Now they would enjoy this. Oviedo’s Kwasi Sibo in front of
  Real Madrid’s Aurélien Tchouaméni. Oviedo’s Santi Cazorla runs while the Real
  coach Xabi Alonso watches. Real Madrid’s Kylian Mbappé scores their first
  goal. Oviedo players after the match. About Elena and Carlos, born in 2001,
  members ever since, babies then and adults now, performing the honorary
  kick-off, representing a new generation. About Armando Barbón, Peter Dubovsky
  and Pelayo Novo, players who tragically passed away too young and the
  thousands of fans who were missed on Sunday too. About the tifo and the sea of
  blue, the old T-shirts everywhere, cheap and tatty now but priceless: “I
  didn’t abandon Oviedo in tercera”. About the tears, the noise, the anthem and
  the chants, the old one that insists we’ll be back dropped now. About everyone
  else embracing this, even the opposition: if Oviedo have missed the first
  division, the first division has missed them too, Alonso hugging Cazorla at
  full time. “I was quite emotional because I know what this moment is, what it
  means to him: the atmosphere was amazing,” Madrid’s manager said. Looking up
  at the stands at the final whistle, the Oviedo goalkeeper Aarón Escandell has
  been beaten and he will talk about the game but first he has something simple
  to say: “Thank you.”
