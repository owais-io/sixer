  Jerry Adler, who has died aged 96, was best known for his role in The Sopranos
  as Herman “Hesh” Rabkin, Tony Soprano’s unofficial consigliere, whose
  twinkling eyes disguised a ruthless business mind, and later as Howard Lyman
  in The Good Wife. Adler was already 70 when he began on The Sopranos; he had
  been in show business since he was 21, but had spent more than four decades as
  a stage manager and director, first on the stage and then in television,
  before he moved in front of the cameras. Jerry (Jerome) was born in Brooklyn,
  New York, to Philip, a theatre manager on Broadway and for touring shows, and
  Pauline (nee Goldberg), known as Polly. Philip was part of the Yiddish theatre
  family headed by his uncle, the Ukrainian-born Jacob Pavlovich Adler, whose
  children included the acting coach Stella Adler, six of whose siblings or
  half-siblings became actors. She was a founding member of the influential
  Group Theatre; her brother Luther was arguably the family’s most successful
  actor on screen and Philip Adler became general manager of the company. “I am
  a creature of nepotism,” Jerry said. He attended Samuel J Tilden high school
  in the Flatbush neighbourhood of Brooklyn, then Syracuse University. One day
  in 1950 he left university when his father called to offer him a job as
  assistant stage manager on Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, starring Carol Channing.
  A revival of the George S Kaufman/Gershwin brothers Of Thee I Sing followed in
  1952, and then he worked on the original My Fair Lady production, in 1956,
  with Rex Harrison and a 20-year-old Julie Andrews. His later work included
  Mike Nichols’s 1966 The Apple Tree, with Alan Alda, and the 1967 Broadway
  debut of Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming. He moved seamlessly into directing
  with Sammy Cahn’s one-man show Words &amp; Music (1974) and was nominated for
  a Drama Desk award for the revival of My Fair Lady (1976), 20 years after the
  original he had stage managed. The same year he did a less successful revival,
  of Hellzapoppin starring Jerry Lewis, and in 1979 was the production
  supervisor on Richard Rodgers’ musical I Remember Mama, the last work before
  Rodgers’ death. In 1983 Adler moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his
  children, moving to the small screen, as stage manager of the daytime soap
  opera Search for Tomorrow; during which time he did the same on the 1985 Tony
  Awards. The next year, he moved to another soap opera, Santa Barbara, and
  directed the TV movie Class of ’86. While still stage managing Santa Barbara,
  he made the move to acting in 1991, when a friend got him to meet the director
  Howard Franklin, who immediately said Adler reminded him of his own father,
  and cast him in The Public Eye (1992), starring Joe Pesci as character based
  on Weegee, the famed New York newspaper photographer. Before the movie opened,
  he got his first television role, in Brooklyn Bridge, a coming of age comedy
  set in the 1950s. He then appeared in one of his best remembered roles, in
  Woody Allen’s Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), cast as a man Allen suspects of
  having murdered his wife (played by Lynn Cohen). The same year he was in a
  well-received TV movie, The Odd Couple: Together Again, with Jack Klugman and
  Tony Randall. Adler became an in-demand character actor, in series such as
  Spin City and Law and Order, and moved into recurring parts, as a rabbi in
  Northern Exposure (1994-95) and on the soap One Life to Live (1995). He became
  a third-billed regular on Hudson Street (1995-96), a crime series set in
  Hoboken, New Jersey; The Sopranos followed in 1999. During the eight years he
  was involved with The Sopranos, he returned to Broadway, this time on stage,
  in Elaine May’s Taller Than a Dwarf (2000), and also did two seasons as the
  live-in father of Bob Saget’s single parent in the comedy series Raising Dad.
  The Sopranos ended in 2007, and that year he was in the film The Memory Thief,
  followed by Charlie Kaufman’s Synecdoche, New York (2008), in which he and
  Cohen again played husband and wife. He also played the fire chief Sidney
  Feinberg in Rescue Me, from 2007 to 2011, and then joined the legal and
  political drama The Good Wife (2011-16) with two more seasons on its successor
  series The Good Fight. He played Jeffrey Tambor’s father in Transparent
  (2017-19) and had a recurrent part as the handyman in Mad About You in the
  90s; his final screen credit came in the series’ 2019 revival. In 2008 he
  wrote the script for a TV documentary, Medal of Honor, and returned to the
  stage in 2015, in Larry David’s Fish in the Dark. Adler’s 2024 memoir, Too
  Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies was
  an engaging book which did just what it said on the cover. “You know what’s
  interesting?” he said in 2017. “You spend your whole career backstage. Nobody
  knows who you are, or even knows your name ... Then you do a television show
  and suddenly you’re a celebrity and everyone knows your face.” Adler is
  survived by his third wife, Joan Laxman, a psychologist, whom he married in
  1994, and four daughters, Laura, Alisa, Amy, and Emily, from his earlier two
  marriages. • Jerry (Jerome Elliott) Adler, actor, director and stage manager,
  born 4 February 1929; died 23 August 2025
