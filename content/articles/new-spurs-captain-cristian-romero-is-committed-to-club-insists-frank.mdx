  Thomas Frank has insisted Cristian Romero is committed to Tottenham and has
  backed the defender to become an even better leader after being handed the
  captaincy. Romero, named captain after Son Heung-min’s departure for Los
  Angeles FC, has faced questions over his commitment to Spurs in recent
  seasons. The 27-year-old has been accused of caring more about playing for
  Argentina and was linked with a move to Atlético Madrid this summer but Frank
  is confident the centre-back’s long-term future lies in north London. “I’ve
  worked with him closely for more than five weeks; I’ve seen a very, very
  committed player who’s trained very well,” the Spurs manager said. “The staff
  have said to me they’ve never seen him train that well. He’s in a very good
  place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team.”
  Frank was asked whether giving Romero the armband was potentially the first
  step towards the player extending his contract, which expires in two years.
  “Yes,” he said. “But I think when you name a captain it’s because you think
  he’s the best that can help the team no matter what now and also in the
  future. It’s not really linked with the contract situation. Of course he’s a
  very good player so I want him to stay longer.” Romero has lacked consistency
  at times but Frank is convinced of his quality. “I see a very big and very
  good player. What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his
  leadership qualities on the pitch. There is a big respect for him from the
  players. Off the pitch as well he also sets the standards. “When I was 27 of
  course I thought I could do everything but I also found out that as a leader I
  am 1,000% better now, so he also needs to learn and become better and better,
  so I will do my best to guide him. His aggression is phenomenal. He is
  fantastic in the duels. When he gives that to the team, he can transform the
  team and give energy to the team so I think that’s extremely important.” Spurs
  impressed against Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup final on Wednesday,
  taking a 2-0 lead before losing on penalties. They have a quick turnaround
  before hosting Burnley on Saturday in Frank’s first league game but the Dane
  believes that the Dutch centre-back Micky van de Ven, who had fitness problems
  last season, can handle two games a week. Frank confirmed Spurs were in the
  market for attacking signings. They have held talks with Manchester City over
  Savinho and are preparing an opening bid for Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze,
  whose £68m release clause expired on Friday. Arsenal are still dithering over
  a move for Eze.
