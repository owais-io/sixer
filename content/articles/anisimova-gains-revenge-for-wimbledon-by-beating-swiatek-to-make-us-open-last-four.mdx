  Amanda Anisimova conjured the performance of her career on Wednesday afternoon
  in New York, banishing the ghosts of her Wimbledon nightmare with a
  sensational 6-4, 6-3 quarter-final victory against second-seeded Iga Swiatek
  in 1hr 36min. Less than eight weeks after she had been double-bagelled by the
  Polish star in the final at the All England Club, the 24-year-old American
  struck back with fearless ball-striking and nerveless resolve to reach her
  first US Open semi-final. Swiatek, a six-time major champion and the 2022 US
  Open winner, looked intent on reprising the script when she broke immediately
  to extend her personal run to 13 consecutive games in the rivalry. But the
  eighth-seeded Anisimova struck back on her third break point, finishing with a
  thumping forehand overhead that drew a roar from the Arthur Ashe crowd and
  ensured this would bear no resemblance to the rout in July. “Honestly, when I
  wasn’t able to hold in that first game, I was really, like, OK, here we go,”
  Anisimova admitted afterwards. “Winning that first game kind of took some
  stress off my shoulders. Once I got it, I was easing into the match.” The
  opening set was tightly wound and fiercely contested, Anisimova fending off
  break point with a crisp backhand down the line at 2-2 and Swiatek producing
  her best point of the match, a 17-shot exchange capped with a forehand
  overhead, to keep pace at 3-4. With Swiatek serving at 4-5, Anisimova forced
  two set points and converted the second when her rival sprayed a forehand
  long. In 50 minutes she had pocketed the opener, winning 12 of 17 points on
  her opponent’s second serve with the kind of incendiary hitting and baseline
  aggression that have long been her trademarks. Swiatek, whose summer haul
  already included titles at Wimbledon and Cincinnati, tried to reassert herself
  at the start of the second, breaking for 2-0 as the crowd stirred uneasily.
  Anisimova refused to retreat, holding firm from 15-30 and then lashing a
  forehand return winner to create double break point in the fourth game. A
  ballistic backhand sealed the break back and from there the American never let
  go of the initiative. Swiatek’s usually impenetrable composure began to crack
  as her first-serve percentage dipped and the intensity of the duress mounted.
  Serving at 3-4 she faltered again, coughing up the decisive break with her
  third double fault of the set. Moments later Anisimova secured her place in
  the last four with a backhand winner that clipped the net cord and tumbled
  over. “Today was definitely different than any other match I’ve played because
  of the circumstances,” said Anisimova, who was born in central New Jersey and
  grew up in Florida. “I really tried to prepare myself mentally over the last
  24 hours, more than physically. I came out there with not an ounce of fear. I
  was constantly moving and trying to pump myself up, which is not something I
  usually do. I felt like I was really supporting myself, and that helped me
  play better.” She also revealed she had revisited the trauma of Wimbledon the
  night before. “Nobody told me to, but I watched it back, as painful as it was,
  just to see what I can avoid or what went wrong,” she said. “Then I had to
  watch some good highlights to remove that from my brain. I think it was
  important for me to see what happened last night going into today’s match. I
  realised I was so slow in that final. But it happens, I’m human. Some people
  freeze sometimes.” Swiatek, candid in defeat, pointed to her serving
  struggles. “From the baseline I felt it was good, but the serve made the
  difference,” she said. “Amanda was winning more points from her serve, and I
  struggled to make first serves in. She returned the ball so well from my
  second serve. That made the difference.” She stressed that Wimbledon hadn’t
  given her a false sense of security: “It didn’t matter to me. Everybody knows
  how Amanda can play. She didn’t play well at Wimbledon, but it’s not like
  she’s always going to make the same mistakes. Today everything was different.”
  For Anisimova, who took a mental-health hiatus in 2023 and only last year
  clawed her way back into the top 50, the win was both cathartic and historic.
  Already a finalist at Wimbledon this summer and a semi-finalist at Roland
  Garros in 2019, she has now delivered her breakthrough on home soil. She is
  also the first American woman since Serena and Venus Williams in 2002 to reach
  the semi-finals on all three surfaces at grand slam events. She crunched
  nearly twice as many winners (23) as unforced errors (12) and controlled the
  tempo throughout, rushing Swiatek with the depth of her groundstrokes and
  holding her nerve in the biggest moments. “Today is definitely the most
  meaningful victory I’ve had in my life,” she said. “It’s the farthest I’ve
  ever gone at the US Open and it feels surreal. I feel like I’ve proved to
  myself that I can really go head-to-head with the top players.” On Thursday
  she will face Naomi Osaka for a place in the final. “She’s won four grand
  slams, she obviously knows the game very well and is very successful,”
  Anisimova said. “She plays really well on the hard courts. I feel like she’s
  really found her groove and she looks like she’s enjoying it out there.” In
  that Osaka is not alone. Fifty-three days after her Wimbledon heartbreak,
  Anisimova has dramatically reversed her fortunes and given New York a comeback
  story to savour.
