  Thanks to a new venture by the chef Kardea Brown, the Charleston international
  airport in South Carolina is now a gateway for many to experience Gullah
  Geechee culture through cuisine. Earlier this year, Brown, known for being the
  host of Delicious Miss Brown on the Food Network, opened Kardea Brown’s
  Southern Kitchen at the Charleston airport. The restaurant features recipes
  passed down from her foremothers, including her mother, grandmother and
  great-grandmother. People say “this is beyond any airport food we’ve ever
  had,” Brown told the Guardian. The restaurant sold out on its first day and
  has continued to be popular with travelers. The Gullah Geechee people are the
  descendants of Africans who were enslaved on plantations in the Sea Islands.
  Because they were highly isolated on plantations scattered across islands and
  coastal lands, descendants were able to retain and create a unique culture
  with a distinct language, food, music and art. That culture persists even
  today despite years of attempts to assimilate Gullah Geechee people into
  mainstream American culture and the gentrification of historic Gullah Geechee
  lands. Much of the traditional Gullah Geechee diet consists of food that’s
  familiar to people today: okra, rice, yams, hot peppers and peas, for example,
  foods that are also central to diets in coastal west Africa. Airport travelers
  can try fried green tomatoes, a fried fish plate, pimento cheese grits balls,
  red rice, collard greens and other dishes. “They love the hospitality of it
  all, how the food is very fresh and made to order,” Brown said. “The fact that
  you’re getting down-home, Lowcountry, southern food at the airport is a plus.”
  Brown, who is from Charleston and spent much of her childhood on Wadmalaw
  Island, is not a classically trained chef, but she grew up around people and
  women who loved to cook. Cooking and food were always at the center of family
  gatherings, she told the Guardian. But Brown went to school for psychology and
  then went into the social work field. She said cooking became an outlet with
  which to process how taxing her course work could be. In 2014, she was cooking
  while an ex-boyfriend recorded her. He sent the video to a producer who said
  that they wanted to feature Brown on a new show for the Cooking Channel. While
  the show didn’t make it, Brown’s appearance in the pilot catapulted her
  career. In 2015, she started the New Gullah Supper Club, a traveling pop-up
  supper club that centered Gullah dishes. Since then, she has authored a
  bestselling cookbook and produced a line of frozen meals, Delicious Eats by
  Kardea Brown, which are available at Walmart. Delicious Miss Brown is filmed
  on Edisto Island, and centers local, seasonal and Gullah foods. With the
  opening of Southern Kitchen, Brown is welcoming travelers to get a taste of
  home as soon as they land in Charleston. Gullah Geechee foodways, culture and
  cuisine have shaped the region’s culinary scene – from red rice to okra soup
  to seafood-based dishes – in ways that many tourists may not even realize.
  While there is a distinction between southern foods and Gullah Geechee foods –
  and many Gullah restaurants do sell both – people, even from the region, don’t
  always know the difference. By having a Gullah Geechee restaurant in the
  Charleston international airport, Brown is ensuring that, even if travelers
  don’t otherwise actively engage with Gullah culture during their stay in
  Charleston, the opportunity exists for them to at least try the food. Brown
  wants people who visit the restaurant to leave with full bellies and a warm
  feeling; she wants them to feel like family. “The storytelling aspect of it
  was so important because you have so many [travelers] … it’s a bit of a
  portal, so I thought it was important to highlight that at the airport,” she
  said. “It was very important to grab passengers and tourists – [you have]
  their attention right there at the airport before you even set foot on our
  land. • This article was amended on 7 August 2025 to correct the spelling of
  Kardea Brown’s first name in the subheading.
