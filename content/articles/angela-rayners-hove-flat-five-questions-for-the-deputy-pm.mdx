  Angela Rayner is under pressure to explain her property arrangements after she
  bought an £800,000 flat in Hove, far from her constituency of
  Ashton-under-Lyne. Most of the criticism has centred on the complicated tax
  arrangements surrounding the purchase, though the deputy prime minister’s
  allies insist she has done nothing wrong and she is not under investigation by
  the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards. Rayner has not said
  anything yet about the row, which Downing Street said on Monday was partly
  because a court had ruled some information could not be disclosed. But here
  are five questions she will face when she does speak publicly about it. Where
  does she actually live? Rayner spends time in three properties: a constituency
  home in Ashton-under-Lyne, a grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House on
  Whitehall, and a new flat in Hove. When she bought the flat in Hove in May,
  she listed it as her primary property, allowing her to pay an estimated
  £30,000 in stamp duty rather than the higher rate of £70,000. The problem with
  this is that she has separately listed her constituency home as her primary
  property, in a move which allowed her to avoid paying about £2,000 a year in
  council tax on her grace-and-favour apartment in London. The Ashton home has
  now been put fully into a trust, allowing her to remove her name from the
  deeds and buy the Hove flat. But she still spends a lot of her time in that
  house, given her children live there and it is the only property out of the
  three which is in her constituency. Why did she put the Ashton house in a
  trust? The Mail on Sunday revealed over the weekend that Rayner had put her
  Greater Manchester house partly in a trust in 2023, before fully selling up
  this year. The trust was administered by Shoosmiths, a law firm which has a
  private wealth team to help rich clients manage their financial affairs. Some
  have suggested Rayner used a trust to avoid her children paying inheritance
  tax when she dies. However, experts say that if she is living there at the
  time of her death, they will still have to pay the tax, regardless of whether
  it is held in trust. That implies there may have been non-tax reasons to
  choose a trust, including making sure that none of her children can sell their
  share in the house without the agreement of the others. It may be significant
  however that at the time the property was put in trust, its value was listed
  at £650,000. If it had been a pound higher, Rayner would have had to pay an
  inheritance tax charge at that point. Has she broken any tax laws? Most tax
  experts agree with Rayner’s allies, who insist she has not broken any actual
  rules. There is nothing wrong, for example, with listing one property as a
  primary residence for council tax purposes but another for stamp duty
  purposes. Some however, believe this constitutes a loophole which Rayner has
  successfully exploited. “I have long said we should allow HMRC to communicate
  with councils so they can be consistent in their tax treatment of properties,”
  said Heather Powell, a partner at the accountant Blick Rothenberg. But some
  say tax inspectors could still revisit the question of whether Rayner should
  have paid more stamp duty on the Hove flat. “Simply removing your name from a
  deed is not enough to persuade the Revenue that that is not your primary
  property,” said Henry Pryor, a property agent. “If you are still living at
  that property, Revenue could deem your new one a secondary property for stamp
  duty purposes.” Why are her arrangements so complicated? Allies say Rayner’s
  family life makes her finances more complex than most. She had a child aged 16
  with her then partner, Neil Batty, but the relationship did not last. She then
  married Mark Rayner, a trade union official, in 2010, and the couple had two
  sons. She and Rayner split in 2020 and are understood to have divorced in
  2023, which was when they put the Ashton house into a trust, of which both
  served as trustees. She is now understood to alternate in the house with Mark,
  while their children remain there permanently. More recently Rayner has
  entered a relationship with Sam Tarry, the former Labour MP for Ilford South.
  The couple are reported to have spent time together at the Hove flat. Others
  however point out that many of her property decisions have also had the impact
  of minimising tax. “These arrangements are probably legal, but Mr and Mrs
  Average don’t do it – they can’t afford it,” said Powell. How is Labour
  planning to change property taxes in future? One reason the revelations have
  particular resonance is that they come just as Rachel Reeves looks for ways to
  repair her fiscal black hole, with property taxes reported to be in her
  crosshairs. The chancellor is reported to be looking at ways to tax second
  homes more, whether that is through a replacement to stamp duty, or more
  likely, higher rates of capital gains tax. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative
  leader, spent Monday trying to highlight exactly that dichotomy, talking to
  homeowners in Reigate about what she believes the chancellor will announce at
  her budget later this year. That being said, Rayner did receive backing from
  an unexpected quarter last week, when the Reform UK leader insisted the row
  was confected. “This whole sort of hair-shirt approach – most of the press
  want politicians in sackcloth and ashes, would like all of us to be vegan and
  give up drinking,” said Nigel Farage. “Well, it’s not happening here.”
