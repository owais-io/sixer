  Phillip Inman’s got me bang to rights (Can a nation in crisis rely on the baby
  boomer generation to step up? I think the UK is about to find out, 21 August).
  Born in 1953, passed the 11-plus, joined the 8% who went to university and
  spent a lifetime in white-collar jobs that paid well enough for housing and
  pensions. Not all smooth sailing – four or five redundancies – but each came
  with a lump sum and a decent job soon after. And I was a basic rate taxpayer
  for all but a few years. Now I’ve got assets far beyond my needs, and children
  who don’t need my money. But Inman misses why many of us hold on to what we
  have: we’ve seen decades of social care failure and want to ensure that we can
  afford the eye-watering costs ahead. The housing market doesn’t help – ageing
  households face an archaic property-exchange system. We tackled it when we had
  to, but there’s no urgency now. And the idea that the private sector will
  provide? Not when Guardian columns are full of service-charge horror stories.
  Why dive into shark-infested waters? Every age group votes in their
  self-interest, not just the old. Since 1974, none of my votes were cast for
  personal gain. Mortgage tax relief, bus pass, triple lock – grateful, yes, but
  they didn’t sway me. And if they’re taken away, I won’t vote out of spite.
  It’s older generations who still give time to the community. We’re no longer a
  clubbable society – working men’s clubs, political parties and professional
  associations are collapsing. People in their 30s to 50s aren’t stepping up
  when boomers step down. Yet Inman expects us to act collectively and
  patriotically. By all means, pluck my feathers – but do it in such a way that
  I won’t squeal. Ged Parker Washington, Tyne and Wear • Phillip Inman is
  correct that the over-65s own a disproportionate share of family homes, but
  his attack on them otherwise is rather absurd. One of the main reasons there
  is a housing shortage is Margaret Thatcher’s misguided selling-off of council
  houses that were never replaced. As he points out, many retired people would
  like to move, but there is a severe shortage of smaller homes, and many
  people, rightly, don’t want to move a long way from where they live. Inman
  should quit dumping on seniors and put the blame for the housing crisis where
  it mostly belongs – on the UK’s complete failure for five decades to invest in
  building affordable housing. But his most absurd claim is that boomers should
  give “more of their time to local communities rather than jetting off on
  several holidays a year”. First, older people do take holidays, but it is
  families with children who take the most holidays every year. Second, boomers
  are the most active volunteer sector in the UK, with 58% of those aged 65 to
  74 volunteering in 2023-24. Retirees are helping run food banks, libraries,
  refugee centres, hospitals, charity shops and environmental groups, saving the
  public sector billions every year. We should be thanking them for their
  service. Jean McKendree Westow, North Yorkshire • When I worked, and I worked
  for 50 years, I would have been happy with a tiny living space as I spent all
  my time working. Now that I’m retired, I have very little money (no final
  salary-based pension and holidays for me), so I need a garden and space for my
  hobbies, and to accommodate my grandchildren to allow my daughter to work. Why
  do people assume that old people need a tiny space? I need space to fill my
  time and keep healthy in mind and body. Tiny spaces would mean endless daytime
  TV for me; I’d rather die. Mary Strode Glasgow • Philip Inman has hit the nail
  exactly. Where do boomers downsize to? Certainly not to one of the plethora of
  two-bed flats with tiny balconies. It isn’t just the family house that he is
  asking us to give up, but our gardens too. One of the real pleasures of
  retirement is having time to garden. It also keeps me fit. I am trying to
  downsize. But if I want a garden, I have to move into a family house, albeit
  perhaps a smaller one. Mary Bolton London • I read the replies to Phillip
  Inman’s piece on boomer downsizing (Letters, 22 August; Letters, 26 August).
  Here in the US, there is the same problem, but with much more clarity. Boomers
  who tire of rattling around in a 2,500-plus sq ft house and paying the taxes
  on the same (could be $8,000 or more a year) could move to the
  mixed-use/multi-family developments that they have voted against for the past
  20 to 30 years. If they had permitted some of that to be built, they could
  continue to live in the neighbourhoods they have grown old in, with the same
  access to healthcare, shops, restaurants etc as before. But they chose to deny
  young people or simply those who didn’t want a house and yard that choice. I
  hope they are happy with the consequences of that choice. Paul Beard Seattle,
  Washington, US
