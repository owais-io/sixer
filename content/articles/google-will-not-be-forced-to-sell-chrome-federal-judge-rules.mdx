  Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser, a federal judge ruled on
  Tuesday in the tech giant’s ongoing legal battle over being ruled a monopoly
  last year. The company will be barred from certain exclusive deals with device
  makers and must share data from its search engine with competitors, the judge
  ruled. Judge Amit Mehta’s ruling follows months of speculation surrounding
  what penalties Google would face as a result of his decision last year that
  the company violated antitrust laws as it built what he called an online
  search monopoly. The ruling, one of the most significant antitrust cases in
  decades, resulted in an additional hearing in April to determine what actions
  the government should take as a remedy. Mehta’s decision to allow Google to
  keep Chrome represents a more lenient outcome for the company than what
  federal prosecutors requested: force the tech giant sell off its marquee
  search product and to ban it from entering the browser market for five years.
  In his 230-page ruling, Mehta stated that prosecutors “overreached in seeking
  forced divesture of these key assets”. Although Google escaped the most
  serious consequences of its antitrust violations, Mehta’s ruling sided with
  prosecutors in barring the company from entering or maintaining exclusive
  contracts relating to the distribution of its products including Chrome,
  Google Assistant and the Gemini app. The ruling does not bar Google from
  making any payments to distributors, however, stating that a broad payment ban
  would create downstream harms. Google’s shares rose in after-hours trading
  following Mehta’s decision, a sign that investors believe the outcome
  favorable to Google. The ruling drew criticism from the American Economic
  Liberties project, a non-profit advocacy group, which called it a “complete
  failure”. “You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence
  him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive
  director of the American Economic Liberties Project. “Similarly, you don’t
  find Google liable for monopolization and then write a remedy that lets it
  protect its monopoly.” Google argued in the antitrust case, which first went
  to trial in 2023, that its dominance over search was not related to
  anticompetitive behavior but simply the result of producing a better product.
  Prosecutors, meanwhile, showed how Google had spent billions of dollars on
  deals with device makers such as Samsung and Apple to make its browser the
  default search on their products, allowing it to capture about 90% of the US
  search market. “After having carefully considered and weighed the witness
  testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is
  a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta ruled
  last year. Mehta’s decision on remedies this week stated that there had been
  notable changes to the internet search industry since the case ended last
  year, and that his ruling was crafted to address both general search engines,
  or GSEs, as well as the rise of AI search engines and chatbots, which Google
  has also created. “These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about
  promoting competition among GSEs as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search
  does not carry over into the GenAI space,” Mehta stated. Google is also facing
  a separate hearing later this year over how the government will address
  antitrust violations related to its monopoly over online advertising
  technology.
