  Crystal Palace are demanding that Liverpool increase their offer of £35m for
  Marc Guéhi to match their valuation of £40m for the England defender before
  sanctioning his departure. Liverpool are understood to have submitted an
  official bid for Guéhi on Saturday that was immediately countered by Palace.
  They want an initial £35m plus another £5m in bonuses and a 10% sell-on clause
  to be included in the deal, with talks continuing. Guéhi has less than 12
  months remaining on his contract and has refused to sign an extension, with
  the Palace chair, Steve Parish, admitting after their victory over Arne Slot’s
  side in the Community Shield that he may have to be sold this month to avoid
  losing the 25-year-old for free next summer. Liverpool are understood to be
  Guéhi’s preferred destination but the Premier League champions had yet to
  formalise their approach until Saturday afternoon. Palace are believed to be
  ready to allow him to depart if their valuation is met, despite Oliver Glasner
  saying on Friday that it was too late to sign a replacement, given the
  transfer window closes on Monday. Palace, who rejected a bid worth up to £70m
  for Guéhi from Tottenham in January, have been desperate to add defensive
  reinforcements amid uncertainty over his future and agreed a deal worth up to
  €27m (£23.4m) with Toulouse for Jaydee Canvot, with the France Under-20s
  defender expected to sign a five-year contract at Selhurst Park. Canvot is
  seen as a player with huge potential, having made his breakthrough in Ligue 1
  last season. But the FA Cup winners have been frustrated so far in their
  efforts to find a more experienced replacement and Liverpool are believed to
  have rejected an approach to sign Joe Gomez on loan as part of the Guéhi deal.
  The England defender could still be available on a permanent deal, while
  Palace have been in talks with Manchester City over a move for Manuel Akanji
  but the Switzerland defender has interest from Milan so will likely move
  elsewhere. They have also made inquiries about taking former Southampton
  defender Mohammed Salisu on loan from Monaco. Glasner made it clear on Friday
  that he wants Guéhi to stay. “From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal
  Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi
  replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter,
  being consistent,” said the Palace manager. “When we see our foundation of
  success in the last few months, it’s our defence … Marc is a crucial part.
  Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.”
