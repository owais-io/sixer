  I first discovered Olly Alexander, of Years &amp; Years, by accident. I was
  teaching English as a foreign language in South Korea, and I showed a video of
  a BBC Glastonbury roundup on the projector as part of the lesson. I remember
  glimpsing an incredibly cute blond guy on stage, and being transfixed. I knew
  immediately that he was gay because the way he moved was unashamedly fluid and
  graceful. He was doing a pirouette. The clip was so short there wasn’t even a
  mention of the name of the band, so I had to do some detective work. I Googled
  something ridiculous like “bleached hair gay man Glastonbury 2015” and trawled
  through hundreds of search results until I found him. I was 24 and out as
  bisexual, but I had never done more than kiss a man. I grew up on the west
  coast of Ireland, and while my area was relatively liberal, we still used the
  F-slur regularly and referred to anything remotely crap or weak as “gay”. At
  school, I liked girls enough to distract myself from the fact that I also
  liked boys – but by the time I was in my final year of university, I wasn’t
  able to ignore my feelings for men any more. I told friends and family I was
  bisexual, but I did it in an almost aggressive way. My attitude was: “I’m
  bisexual and if you have a problem with that, I don’t want to hear about it.”
  Looking back, I think I was being defensive: I didn’t want to discuss my
  sexuality because I wasn’t entirely comfortable with it yet. It made me feel
  vulnerable to accept that I was interested in men because it messed with my
  sense of masculinity. I am still often perceived by strangers as straight.
  When I did develop a crush on a boy, growing up, it would be a macho lad who
  liked football and girls. Discovering Olly Alexander was seismic for me
  because it was the first time I fancied a man who was openly gay in his
  presentation. In the weeks after I found Olly online, I listened to Years
  &amp; Years’ debut album, Communion, on repeat. In a few songs, Olly refers to
  his love interest as “boy”, and I remember listening out for that word and
  feeling electrified by it. I was taking taekwondo lessons in my spare time,
  and I suggested to my instructor that we put Communion on in the background
  while we trained. Because it’s a form of combat, taekwondo is a hypermasculine
  sport, but it is also elegant and feminine in the sense that it is like a
  dance. Listening to that music while doing those moves made me feel as if I
  was pulling together the two parts of my own nature, and finding some balance
  between the masculine and the feminine. At the point in the session when we
  were doing a particularly high-intensity kicking routine, the song King would
  start playing on the record – which is all about being desired by another man
  on a night out. My instructor loved the record too, although he was a very
  traditional South Korean man, and from small comments he had made I could tell
  he was casually homophobic. He had no idea that he was enjoying an album about
  gay men in the club. The music unlocked something in me. I began to pursue
  boys and go to gay clubs.My first sexual experiences with men happened at
  precisely the same time as I was discovering Communion. When I listen to Shine
  now – which is about the magnetic feeling between two men – I still get this
  feeling in my stomach. It’s difficult for me to disentangle the feeling of
  desire from the excitement I feel when I hear the opening bars. I started
  dating my first boyfriend around the time Years &amp; Years’ second album,
  Palo Santo, came out, so Olly Alexander’s music doesn’t just sound like lust
  to me. It also sounds like love. Anonymous Did a cultural moment prompt you to
