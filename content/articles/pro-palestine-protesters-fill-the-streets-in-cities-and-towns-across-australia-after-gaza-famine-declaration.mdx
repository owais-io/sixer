  Brisbane has amassed the largest pro-Palestinian crowd in the city’s history,
  rally organisers say, as thousands marched across Australia in a show of
  support for the Palestinian cause, days after famine was declared in Gaza for
  the first time. In Brisbane, organisers estimated at least 50,000 people
  gathered for a rally they described as “historic”, with Queensland police
  putting the figure at 10,000. In Melbourne, organisers said 100,000 marched –
  a figure at odds with Victoria police’s estimate of 10,000 – while in Sydney,
  rally organisers put the crowd at 100,000, in contrast to New South Wales
  police who estimated that 10,000 people took part in the public assembly.
  Justice for Palestine Magan-djin spokesperson Remah Naji told Brisbane’s crowd
  on Sunday afternoon that it was “the biggest pro-Palestine rally that this
  city has ever seen”. Sunday’s marches were expected by organisers to be the
  largest pro-Palestine demonstrations in Australia’s history, with every major
  Palestine organising group joining for a countrywide day of action in around
  40 cities and towns. Marchers demanding sanctions and an end to Australia’s
  arms trade with Israel were backed by more than 250 community organisations
  and unions, including the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Unions NSW, Hunter
  Workers, Unions WA and South Coast Labour Council. Naji said the high turnout
  in Brisbane could be attributed to authorities banning protesters from
  marching across the Story Bridge. Organisers had to pivot after a magistrate
  on Thursday vetoed plans by organisers to march across the bridge on community
  safety grounds, which Queensland police acting assistant commissioner Rhys
  Wildman welcomed. On Sunday afternoon, ferries were at capacity and city
  streets in Brisbane were swelling as thousands of demonstrators gathered at
  Queens Garden in the city centre before following an agreed alternative route
  on Victoria Bridge. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, was among them. She
  told Guardian Australia she estimated it was the “biggest gathering since
  those against the Iraq war”. “I think it is a real show of sentiment by
  ordinary people that they know our government should be doing more and they
  want them to be doing more,” she said. Jawad Al Maj, who came to Australia as
  a refugee from Iran, said he attended the Brisbane rally out of a sense of
  moral obligation. Al Maj was holding his two-year-old daughter Khadija, while
  his wife – sixth-generation Australian, Amira – pushed their one-year-old son
  Hussain in a pram. “The difference between my kids and those kids in Palestine
  is geography. It’s luck,” the warehouse worker from Underwood said. “It could
  have been my kids being blown up while Australia is silent. “If I were in that
  situation I’d hope that people would speak up for me. So I’m speaking up.”
  Palestine Action Group’s Sydney spokesman Josh Lees said the movement was the
  “biggest it’s ever been”, with Sunday’s protests coming just weeks after a
  crowd on 3 August estimated at between 90,000 to 300,000 marched across the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge after a supreme court bid by NSW police to block the
  protest was defeated. “That bridge march has generated so much momentum around
  the country,” Lees said. “The dam has burst in terms of support for Palestine
  and opposition to this genocide.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Protests
  began taking place from midday in every capital city on Sunday, as well as
  regional areas including Shepparton, Geraldton, Coffs Harbour, Katoomba,
  Tathra and the Pine Gap military intelligence base, some holding
  pro-Palestinian protests for the first time. The action comes days after the
  United Nations confirmed famine in parts of the Gaza Strip for the first time,
  as Israel prepares for a military takeover of the entire city. More than
  60,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health
  officials – mostly women, children and elderly people – since the war stated
  after 7 October 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 200
  hostages at an Israeli music festival. Figures from a classified Israeli
  military intelligence database indicate five out of six Palestinians killed by
  Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians, an extreme rate of slaughter
  rarely matched in recent decades of warfare. In Canberra, independent senator
  for the ACT David Pocock was among the speakers who addressed a crowd of
  around 2,000 people in Civic Square, according to police estimates. “As a
  middle power, we can and must be doing more,” he said. “People care deeply,
  and they want a government that’s actually going to listen and then act.” In
  Sydney, author and survivor advocate Grace Tame, journalist Antoinette Lattouf
  and NSW Teachers Federation president Henry Rajendra addressed a gathering at
  Hyde Park before marching to Belmore Park, while in Hobart, lord mayor Anna
  Reynolds and independent federal MP Andrew Wilkie were among those leading the
  crowds, estimated by organisers at around 4,000. In Melbourne, protesters
  gathered at the State Library of Victoria before marching to the state’s
  parliament via Flinders Street station, attracting a crowd so large
  participants reported struggling to access the phone network. Protesters
  cheered as people waved Palestinian flags from building windows and balconies,
  chanting “occupation no more” and “sanction Israel now” in the 97th
  consecutive weekend rally in the southern capital. The Greens deputy leader,
  Mehreen Faruqi, was among those to address the crowd. In the regional Victoria
  city of Shepparton, hundreds of adults and children walked the streets of the
  CBD chanting “Free Palestine” and “Freedom for Gaza”. On the NSW south coast,
  organisers estimated around 500 people gathered in Tathra despite the rain and
  wind, marching across the the Mogareeka Bridge armed with a banner reading
  “Bega Valley for Palestine”. “It’s not Sydney Harbour Bridge but the feelings
  of anger and frustration are the same,” one resident wrote on X. In Brisbane,
  the emotions of the crowd vacillated between enthusiasm and hope to despair
  and outrage. Magdalene Parkes, a physician at the Princess Alexandra hospital,
  said she simply could not stand to “see any more photos of children starving”.
  “There is hope but there is also an element of sadness in the air as well,”
  she said. “A sense of grief that we still have to be out here.” Zubeida, 55,
  an “ex-South African” of Indian heritage, said the turnout in Brisbane was
  “heartwarming”. “We come from an apartheid regime, so we understand what
  apartheid is,” she said. “It is heartwarming to see so many people give up
  their Sunday afternoon to give voice to justice.” Israel has rejected claims
  that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide, an argument that has also been
  brought against it before the international court of justice. The country’s
  prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has called the famine declaration an
  “outright lie”. – Australian Associated Press contributed to this report
