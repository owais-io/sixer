  You can see how it works. First, the case against asylum seekers is based on
  the impact on public services and the costs of accommodation. Then we have
  references to “fighting-age men”. Then we have Nigel Farage explicitly saying
  that asylum seekers are a threat to “our women and girls” and national
  security. It’s a short step from there to “vigilantes” being emboldened to
  harass anyone of colour in the vicinity of an asylum hotel or detention camp.
  Then the distinction between asylum seekers and immigrants gets blurred. This
  is the road to serious racial conflict. Just look at the example of Northern
  Ireland, where perfectly normal legal immigrants have been driven out of some
  areas by rightwing thugs. And what is the Labour government’s response?
  Debunking Reform UK’s increasingly inflammatory myths about asylum seekers and
  immigrants? If only. Instead they call Farage’s plans impractical or
  unworkable. Besides the moral cowardice this displays, it’s also pretty stupid
  when the government’s own responses to the situation show every sign of
  failing to work. Simon Rew London • The Democrats said the same about Donald
  Trump (Farage attacked for ‘ugly’ rhetoric of plan for mass deportation of
  asylum seekers, 26 August). He won because he drove the narrative. Likewise,
  Nigel Farage’s racist populism will win unless Labour drives a strong
  counter-narrative to dispel the notion of threat. Voters persuaded by Farage
  will not respond to moralising by his opponents. People need the facts, loud
  and clear, in simple terms. The reality of who migrants really are, the varied
  reasons why they come, the small percentage that comes in boats and the vast
  economic and social contribution of migrants to this country over decades,
  part of the fabric of our society. Plus our longstanding commitment to giving
  refuge to people in need. None of this is to deny the complexities of modern
  migration. But if our government is not seen to respect and promote the truth
  about migrants, we are in deep trouble. We only have to look across the
  Atlantic to see why. Paula Jones London • Rafael Behr (There’s an obvious way
  to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do it, 27 August) is right
  to decry Nigel Farage’s continued blowing of the immigration dog-whistle, but
  one does need to take into account the factors which explain why his approach
  continues to have traction. At the time the Refugee Convention was signed,
  1951, the world population was 2.54 billion. It is now around 8.2 billion. The
  potential scale of refugee arrivals is thus considerably larger than when
  refugee rights were first adopted. This at a time when the UK cannot afford to
  grant child support to families with more than two children, has astronomical
  NHS waiting lists and a shortage of affordable housing. It is all very well
  waving placards welcoming all comers, but there are legitimate concerns about
  a problem that is orders of magnitude greater than it has ever been. This
  government has recognised that fact but is struggling, in common with all
  other western governments, to find and articulate a solution. Raj Parkash
  London • Rafael Behr expresses the burning frustration of so many that Labour
  refuses to call out the wholesale folly of leaving the EU as the most damning
  indictment of British politics, government and administration in decades, and
  to place the blame firmly where it belongs – on a demagogic snake oil salesman
  and a playbook informed by a far-right international. The cancer that has
  metastasised since the referendum is the rise of binary, zero-sum politics in
  which one can only win by making others lose – and by ever more performative
  cruelty to punish those who are deemed to be the enemy. There is now a
  national crisis. It isn’t about desperate people in boats. It is about Britain
  becoming a hellscape of the kind currently unfolding in the US. Politics is
  about choices. If progressive parties do not rally what is still a majority in
  the country who view a future run by fascistic blowhards with contempt and
  disgust then we are increasingly consigned to mimic a country which many
  British people, including myself, no longer even consider visiting. Kevin
  Lloyd Highbury, London • Nigel Farage and the small number of Reform MPs
  justifies, at most, a couple of column inches on the inside pages of the
  Guardian. Unfortunately, and with the finest of intentions, you and the rest
  of the media continue to make Farage into a towering national political
  figure. This is what happened with Donald Trump in America and, to an extent,
  with Boris Johnson. Do beware! Lavish and extensive promotion enables people
  to think that Nigel Farage is a true and worthy leader. Dr Ian Flintoff Oxford
  • A Downing Street spokesman has refused to rule out negotiations with the
  Taliban concerning returned refugees. We can be certain that all such refugees
  will be murdered by the Taliban and that any assurances to the contrary that
  they may give will not be worth a bucket of cold spit. This statement,
  following Nigel Farage’s barrel-scraping performance on Tuesday, marks a new
  and thoroughly despicable low for this country. Keir Starmer, in just over a
  year you have dragged the party into the moral sewer. After 52 years, you have
  lost my vote. Robert McNulty Manchester • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
  read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
  considered for publication in our letters section.
