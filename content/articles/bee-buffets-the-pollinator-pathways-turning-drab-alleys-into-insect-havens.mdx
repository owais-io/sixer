  Take a closer look at the colourful plants dotted along an initially
  unassuming Bristol alleyway and you’ll see them teeming with insects.
  Bumblebees, hoverflies and ladybirds throng around a mixture of catmint,
  yarrow, geraniums and anemones. “It’s buzzing with pollinators now,” Flora
  Beverley says. Just over a year ago, the alley we are walking down was a
  dreary, litter-strewn dumping ground. Now, thanks to the pollinator pathways
  project, it is filled with nectar-rich plants and bee hotels. Colourful murals
  line the walls. A neighbour and her son passing by stop to tell Beverley they
  watered the plants yesterday. The local people who helped to transform the
  pathways continue to maintain them too. A trail runner and fitness influencer,
  Beverley started the project after a chronic illness left her unable to spend
  as much time running in the countryside. She wanted to bring more nature into
  her local community and, at the same time, help to connect important nearby
  habitats in Bristol including parks and the Northern Slopes nature reserve
  with insect-friendly corridors. The project took off unexpectedly well and in
  the space of a year local groups have revamped seven alleyways around the
  south of the city. Most transformations take place over a weekend. Volunteers
  and mural artists pile in, and it is funded by small grants that Beverley –
  who does not get paid – applies for in her own time, street collections and
  donations from local businesses. “The things that are good for nature tend to
  be very good for people too,” she says. “We’re lucky to have so many green
  spaces in Bristol, but there is a lack of connection between them. Habitat
  fragmentation is a big issue.” Scientists are reporting catastrophic declines
  in insect numbers around the world. International reviews estimate annual
  losses globally of between 1% and 2.5% of total insect biomass every year. The
  drivers of the plummeting numbers vary, but include habitat loss, exposure to
  pesticides and the climate crisis. In the UK, a citizen science survey run by
  the conservation charity Buglife monitors bug splats on cars. It found a 63%
  decline in flying insects between 2021 and 2024. There are many ways to help
  protect insects, some simple, others harder to achieve. Prof Dave Goulson from
  the University of Sussex says that creating more pollinator-friendly habitat
  in our cities is “a fairly easy win”. “We already know that urban areas can be
  surprisingly good for pollinators compared to modern, intensive farmland,” he
  says. “If there were initiatives greening up gardens, parks, road verges,
  roundabouts, cemeteries, little alleys in Bristol, then it all adds up. “And
  there’s no downside to having lots of wildflowers in our cities. As well as
  helping to conserve biodiversity, it connects people with nature. Kids can
  grow up surrounded by bumblebees, butterflies and birdsong.” The Bristol
  alleyways project is the most local of actions, but it taps into a rich global
  movement. The US artist Sarah Bergmann coined the term “pollinator pathway” in
  2007 for her project connecting Seattle University’s campus to Nora’s Woods
  via a corridor of native plants. A huge network of community pollinator
  pathways has since sprung up across 300 towns in 24 states in the US and in
  Ontario, Canada. It began in 2017 when the conservationist Donna Merrill
  offered people near her home town of Wilton free native trees to form a
  passage of pollinator habitat that spanned the Connecticut-New York state
  line. Merrill was particularly inspired by Oslo’s “bee highway” created a few
  years before – a network of green rooftops, beehives and patches of
  insect-friendly plants that stretches across the city. In the UK, Buglife is
  tackling the loss of pollinator habitat on a national scale through its
  B-Lines network, which is mapping a series of 3km-wide insect superhighways
  that crisscross the country, connecting the best remaining wildflower-rich
  areas. The charity has been working with farmers, landowners, wildlife
  organisations, businesses, local authorities and the public for more than 10
  years to help fill at least 10% of each line with insect-friendly plants. The
  B-lines have already supported the population expansion of species such as the
  bilberry bumblebee in Shropshire and the small scabious mining bee in
  south-west England. Buglife invites pollinator projects to mark their
  initiatives across the insect superhighways on an online map, with more than
  3,800 plotted so far. The charity’s B-Lines officer, Rachel Richards, says the
  lines running north-south are particularly important for migrating species and
  those moving northwards as a result of the climate crisis. “Reconnecting
  fragmented landscapes builds resilience,” she says. “As we see more fires and
  floods, it’s quite easy for an amazing site to be destroyed or partly
  destroyed. But if we have the stepping stones of wildflower-rich habitat, it
  can be colonised by insects from neighbouring sites.” Back in Bristol,
  Beverley is hoping to expand her pollinator pathways project and make it as
  sustainable as possible. With hotter and drier summers expected, she has made
  sure to include a variety of hardy and drought-resistant plants in the
  alleyways. Weeds that might block accessibility are manually removed to
  prevent the council spraying herbicide. After her videos of the alleyway
  transformations shared on social media attracted hundreds of thousands of
  views, she also plans to create a template for people outside Bristol to
  emulate. In the meantime, the people living around the existing alleyways are
  eager to look after them. “The small amounts of litter that are dumped there
  get cleaned up really quickly because people know that it’s a wonderful space,
  and we want to keep it that way,” Beverley says. “It’s a bee buffet, and now
  the pollinators are coming in their masses.”
