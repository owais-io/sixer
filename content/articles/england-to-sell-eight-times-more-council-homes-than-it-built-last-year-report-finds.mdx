  England will sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26
  as were constructed the previous year, research has found. Right to buy is
  depleting council housing stock more quickly than public housing can be
  replaced, forcing people to spend more money on private market rents and
  obtain less secure tenancies, a report from the thinktank Common Wealth finds.
  Its analysis of government data in England found that 38,170 social homes and
  2,850 council homes were constructed by the government in 2023-24. In 2024-25,
  2,260 council homes were built. There were 13,966 sell-offs of council houses
  through right to buy in 2023-24 and 8,656 in 2024-25. An analysis in the i
  Paper estimated that 18,500 council homes will be sold off in 2025-26 – more
  than eight times more than the number built in 2024-25. The report concludes
  that if the government wants to increase the supply of social rental housing
  quickly, it must invest in buying back and restoring homes sold off under
  right to buy, alongside more council housebuilding. Adam Peggs, the report’s
  author, said: “We need to pull every effective lever we can find to expand
  public housing. Council housing gave people secure, low-cost homes in the
  past. With the right framework, it can give people high-quality, genuinely
  affordable homes, with real democratic voice in the future too. But we need to
  build the political will to make it happen. “Every day of delay is another day
  families languish in squalid temporary accommodation. The government has the
  tools to turn this emergency around – and more quickly than they might admit –
  they just need to use them.” The report, which is published on Thursday, is
  also calling for expanded “right of first refusal” powers, enabling local
  authorities to be the preferred buyer when ex-social homes and private rental
  homes enter the market. Since 1980, 2.4m council homes have been sold off
  under right to buy, at a discount that Common Wealth calculated was valued at
  £194bn, accounting for house price appreciation, with 41% now belonging to
  private landlords. As a result, council homes have collapsed from
  accommodating about 30% of households in the late 1970s to 6% today, a decline
  of about 80%. Common Wealth’s report analysed council buy-ups of existing
  homes for public and social housing in seven countries, and determined that
  funding and incentivising a national right to buy back scheme would be a
  cost-effective policy in the UK. The Spanish government has granted powers for
  a right of first refusal to the country’s new national public housing company
  after Barcelona acquired 1,500 homes – more than one-fifth of new affordable
  homes in the city – through right of first refusal powers since 2016, often
  below their market value. The report also recommends a national rollout of a
  London scheme, in which the Greater London Authority bought 1,500 mostly
  ex-council homes in the first year of its right to buy back scheme. The New
  Economics Foundation calculated that this would generate a net saving to the
  taxpayer within 16 years. A 2024 report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
  concluded that buyouts would offer better value for public money, rather than
  paying housing benefit to private landlords or private temporary
  accommodation. Kwajo Tweneboa, a social housing campaigner and the author of
  Our Country in Crisis, said: “Homes that were once publicly owned are now
  profit-generating assets for private landlords. That’s the legacy of right to
  buy. Reversing that damage isn’t just a nice idea. It’s essential. “Buying
  back ex-council homes and investing in a new generation of high-quality,
  genuinely affordable council homes must be the backbone of any serious plan to
  fix this crisis. That means central government stepping up with proper funding
  and power – not just warm words and weak targets.” A Ministry of Housing,
  Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these
  figures. We know, however, that too many social homes have been sold off
  before they can be replaced, which has directly contributed to the worst
  housing crisis in living memory. “That’s why we have introduced right-to-buy
  reforms to reverse the decline in much needed council housing, alongside
  investing £39bn to deliver the biggest boost to social and affordable housing
  in a generation.” • This article was amended on 21 August 2025 because an
  earlier version omitted to note that it was an analysis published in the i
  Paper that estimated that 18,500 council homes will be sold off in 2025-26.
