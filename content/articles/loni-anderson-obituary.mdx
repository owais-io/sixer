  The actor Loni Anderson, who has died aged 79, after a long illness, gained
  her greatest recognition on screen in the American sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati,
  playing Jennifer Marlowe, the intelligent, cool and collected receptionist at
  a flagging Ohio radio station. Hugh Wilson, the former Atlanta advertising
  executive who created the programme, which ran for four series between 1978
  and 1982, said he picked Anderson for her looks. But, he added, she insisted
  she would not portray Jennifer as a “dumb blonde”. “I don’t want to play this
  part because I think she’s just here to deliver messages and is window
  dressing,” she told Wilson. “Let’s make her look like Lana Turner and be the
  smartest person in the room.” Wilson also made the receptionist the station’s
  highest-paid employee, who refuses to make coffee, take dictation or type
  letters. “I think women loved the fact I was sexy and smart,” Anderson said in
  2011. “I know it sounds crazy to people today, but in 1978, when we came on,
  not many women were doing both in comedy.” Jennifer, a model of calm and
  efficiency surrounded by incompetence, was most often seen deflecting unwanted
  business calls for Arthur “Big Guy” Carlson (played by Gordon Jump), the
  station’s bumbling general manager, and the attentions of Herb Tarlek (Frank
  Bonner), the boorish sales manager. Anderson’s performance earned her
  nominations for two Emmy awards and three Golden Globes. She continued the
  image of an empowered woman, albeit a slightly naïve one, with the role of
  Pembrook Feeney, a marketing and PR guru, in the 1983 film Stroker Ace, which
  starred Burt Reynolds as an arrogant racing driver. The action comedy was
  deemed a flop by the public and critics, leading Reynolds to say that it was
  responsible for his career nosediving. The off-screen romance between Anderson
  and Reynolds led in 1988 to their marriage, his second, her third. The
  ceremony, in a purpose-built chapel at Reynolds’s Florida ranch, was
  top-secret, although pictures were released of Anderson wearing a
  canary-yellow, seven-carat diamond ring. “I feel like Cinderella,” she said.
  “I married Prince Charming.” But an acrimonious divorce followed six years
  later, with Reynolds saying: “She bought everything in triplicate, from
  everyday dresses to jewellery, to china and linens.” He added that he gave her
  a platinum American Express card with a $45,000 credit limit that she “maxed
  out in half an hour”. Both claimed infidelity by the other. A year after the
  divorce, Anderson accused Reynolds of physical abuse on at least a dozen
  occasions, allegedly when he was under the influence of painkiller drugs. She
  later said he failed to make some child support payments on time for Quinton,
  the son they had adopted (she won primary custody). In 2015, he wrote a cheque
  for $154,520 as a final settlement. Despite the apparent bitterness, when
  Reynolds died in 2018, Anderson acknowledged him as “a big part of my life for
  12 years” and said that she and Quinton “will miss him and his great laugh”.
  Anderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Maxine (nee Kallin), a model,
  and Klaydon Anderson, an environmental chemist. She grew up nearby in
  Roseville, where she attended Alexander Ramsey high school and won beauty
  pageants. She studied art at Minnesota University and married Bruce Hasselberg
  in 1964. Her divorce two years later tied in with her acting debut,
  uncredited, in the film Nevada Smith, a western starring Steve McQueen. While
  earning a living as a high school teacher, she gained experience performing
  with community theatre groups around Minnesota and Minneapolis in the early
  1970s. She played Tzeitel, the eldest daughter, in Fiddler on the Roof and
  secured the leading role of Billie Dawn in Garson Kanin’s play Born Yesterday
  by donning a blond wig over her natural dark hair. “Would you have cast me if
  you knew I wasn’t a blonde?” she asked the director after earning a standing
  ovation on her first night, then taking the wig off. In 1975, a year after
  marrying Ross Bickell, Anderson moved to Los Angeles, had breast reduction
  surgery and dyed her hair platinum blond. “The lighter my hair got, the more
  work I got,” she said. Her early TV roles were small, one-off parts in popular
  series such as S.W.A.T., The Invisible Man, Harry O, and Police Woman (all
  1975), The Bob Newhart Show (1977), The Incredible Hulk and Three’s Company
  (both 1978). Halfway through WKRP in Cincinnati, Anderson took the title role
  in the TV movie The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980), with a then unknown Arnold
  Schwarzenegger as the Hollywood star’s second husband, Mickey Hargitay, a
  bodybuilder. Her television career continued as Sydney Kovak in Partners in
  Crime (1984, titled Fifty/Fifty outside the US), a series teaming her and
  Lynda Carter as widows running a detective agency formerly owned by the
  murdered man who had been husband to both of them. Anderson was back in
  sitcoms to play LK McGuire, a rich widow in a Beverly Hills mansion, in Easy
  Street (1986-87) before reprising the role of Jennifer Marlowe for two
  episodes (1991-92) of The New WKRP in Cincinnati. She played Teri Carson, who
  tries to gain revenge on a judge when her daughter fails to win a beauty
  pageant, in the fourth series of the soap Melrose Place (1996) and continued
  to pop up on television in guest roles until she was cast as Frances, the
  cocktail-drinking mother, in another sitcom, My Sister Is So Gay (2016-20).
  Anderson’s marriage to Bickell ended in divorce in 1981. She married for a
  fourth time, to Bob Flick, in 2008. He survives her, along with Quinton and a
  daughter, Deidra, from her first marriage. • Loni Kaye Anderson, actor, born 5
  August 1945; died 3 August 2025
