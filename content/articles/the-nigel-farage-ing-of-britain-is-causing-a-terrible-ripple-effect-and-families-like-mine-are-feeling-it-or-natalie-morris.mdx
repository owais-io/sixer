  My sister is an amazing aunty to my baby son. She is obsessed with him. So
  much so, she recently used some of her annual leave to take him on a day out.
  She was excited to show him off, proud to push him in his buggy and have
  people assume he was hers for a few hours. She never expected to be met with
  hostility and suspicion. Like me, my sister is a Black mixed-race woman. My
  son is, at a glance, “white-presenting”, with blond hair and blue eyes. As
  they travelled together on the London underground, a woman looked at my son,
  looked at my sister and asked coldly: “Are you child-minding?” It was
  humiliating and invalidating. My sister scrambled to answer, not knowing what
  would happen if her status as blood relative wasn’t believed. Later, she told
  me she wished she hadn’t answered – why does a stranger have the right to
  question her in this way? – but in the moment, she felt rattled. I know this
  feeling well. I have experienced it myself. Surprised looks, invasive
  questioning. In the 14 months since he was born, I have been asked: “Is he
  yours?” a number of times. Sometimes, I am tempted to reply: “No, I kidnapped
  him and strapped him to my chest”, just to see what would happen. It isn’t the
  question itself that’s an issue. I am not against having a conversation about
  heritage approached in the right way. But it’s the presumption that strangers
  are entitled to know anything about me, my family and our background, simply
  because we don’t look how they expect us to. And, lying just beneath innocent
  curiosity, there is often something much darker – the implication that a
  family that looks like mine is inherently suspect, questionable. That we don’t
  automatically belong. Of course, extremists have always felt this way, but
  it’s an ideology that no longer feels confined to the extreme fringes of
  society. Incidents like these are indicative of a broader social shift, a
  gradual normalisation of the hateful, bigoted rhetoric that ultimately
  emboldens members of the public to interrogate Black and brown people on the
  street if they feel threatened. Recently, I was sickened to read the story of
  the Black man vilified and hounded by death threats after far-right activist
  Tommy Robinson shared a video of him playing with his white grandchildren. I
  couldn’t help but think of my late father and how he would have adored
  spending time with his grandson. It breaks my heart that we might have had to
  worry about the optics of their relationship every time they were out
  together. I hoped we were far beyond this, that I was bringing my son up in an
  increasingly tolerant world. But these recent experiences remind me of the
  things my parents went through in the early 1990s when my sister and I were
  babies – the hostility and judgment, the overt racism. My mum, who was white,
  always described it as viscerally painful when people didn’t see her as our
  mother. This should be a thing of the past. After all, the 2021 UK census
  showed the number of people identifying as being from “mixed/multiple ethnic
  groups” increased 40% in the preceding decade. I didn’t expect that now, I
  would feel a similar pain as my mother did. But this is the direct result of a
  social rhetoric that has carefully cultivated a fear of the other. Nigel
  Farage is weaponising this fear, and the disproportionate airtime he is
  receiving is helping to normalise it. The Reform UK leader has dominated
  headlines and news programmes, describing illegal immigration as a “scourge”,
  and floating chilling proposals for the mass deportation of children. At the
  same time, the “raise the colours” movement has spread St George’s flags
  across motorway bridges and middle England town centres, not as a celebration
  of heritage but as a warning that Britain is not for everyone. Just a few
  miles from where we live in east London, the Bell hotel in Epping has been a
  target for weekly far-right protests throughout the summer, with groups of men
  with megaphones shouting abuse at desperate families seeking refuge. These are
  not isolated incidents. They are the inevitable outcome of the drip-feeding of
  cruelty and intolerance into the public psyche. It has created a climate in
  which suspicion is rife, and anyone who doesn’t fit a narrow, racialised
  definition of “Britishness” is portrayed as a threat. Last month, I took my
  son to his first Notting Hill carnival and proudly draped him in his Jamaican
  flag. There is a world in which we could be proud of our Britishness in the
  same way. A world in which a St George’s flag fluttering from a lamp-post
  wouldn’t send a shiver down my spine and make me quicken my pace. But that
  world is drifting further away. This country is changing. The far right now
  represents a real threat and the polls suggest a Reform UK prime minister is
  increasingly possible. We should think hard about that. We can’t let their
  language of division and fear take hold, dictate our cultural identity, or
  decide who gets to feel at home here. Families like mine – interracial,
  blended, adoptive, made up of different skin tones and stories – are an
  integral part of Britain’s present and future. We won’t be pushed to the
  margins. Natalie Morris is national editor at The Lead and author of
