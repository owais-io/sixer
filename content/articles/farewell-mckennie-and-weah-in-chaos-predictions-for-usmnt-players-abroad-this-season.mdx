  season

  Of the players who stayed with their clubs, who will have the best season?
  Sergiño Dest at PSV. The full-back has not only healed from the ACL injury
  that cut short his last campaign, but is off to a torrid start to the new
  Dutch season, with a pair of goals from the back-to-back champions’ first
  three games. It’s early, sure, but the 24-year-old is rested, confident and on
  a club where he doesn’t have to do much defending during domestic games. Dest
  looks entirely capable of turning in another standout season like he did in
  2019-20. That prompted Barcelona to buy him from Ajax to form their right
  flank with Lionel Messi. LS Christian Pulisic at Milan. Something lost in all
  the noise about Pulisic opting to skip the Gold Cup is that ultimately, the
  reason it matters so much is that Pulisic is a very good player. While it
  looks for now like Milan are headed for a rocky season, it probably won’t be
  because of Pulisic performing poorly – he was among the squad’s best players
  last year and will be asked to do even more this time around. Being ‘the man’
  at Milan will be good for Pulisic – whether or not the summer rest was wise
  internationally. JA Josh Sargent at Norwich City. Fans fretting over a strange
  summer – or present v past-player kerfuffles – can take solace in knowing
  there are several solid answers to this question. Pulisic, Antonee Robinson
  and Chris Richards all had great seasons in 2024-25, and all seem poised to
  carry forward that form. In the Championship, Haji Wright is already scoring
  doubles for Coventry. But I think his fellow Championship striker, Sargent,
  may be the player to have the best season after remaining with Norwich despite
  opportunities elsewhere. The 25-year-old has three goals in three games
  already, and shows no signs of letting up. The key is staying healthy –
  Sargent has had great runs of form in the past, and they’ve often been
  interrupted by injuries. MS Which offseason USMNT transfer has the best chance
  of working out? Gio Reyna to Borussia Mönchengladbach. Reyna tops the
  things-can-only-get-better-from-here power rankings, seeing as how he had
  utterly disappeared at Borussia Dortmund, the club that reared him from his
  teenage years. The younger Reyna probably retains more talent in his left
  pinky toe than almost any American to ever play. But it’s been an awfully long
  time since we’ve seen it. Any club that believes in him enough to stump up a
  transfer fee, with his stock at rock bottom, is likely to give him a good
  amount of playing time. That alone is worth the move. LS Tim Weah to Olympique
  Marseille. A move he wanted and a move he got will see Weah prepare well for
  the World Cup, taking on responsibility at a club where there always is
  pressure from fans. An early-season locker room lucha libre has OM in the
  headlines, but that whole situation could actually clear the way for Weah to
  be even more indispensable for Roberto De Zerbi. With a spot in the USMNT
  starting XI seemingly up for grabs, Weah could grasp it firmly with great
  showings in Ligue 1, where he’s already familiar with the style after starting
  his pro career with PSG. JA Johnny Cardoso to Atlético Madrid. Similar to
  Sargent, the USMNT transfer potentially poised for best success is a player
  that’s yet to fully translate his club form to the national team. The
  23-year-old New Jersey-born midfielder moved from Real Betis to Atlético
  Madrid over the summer. He could have a season under Diego Simeone that would
  be too impactful for Mauricio Pochettino (who was there in person for
  Cardoso’s debut) to ignore. MS Which offseason USMNT transfer has the worst
  chance of working out? Tim Weah to Olympique Marseille. The winger evidently
  inherited Weston McKennie’s penchant for being pushed out of Juventus. Except
  that he was willing to go. After reportedly nixing a move to Nottingham Forest
  – probably a good call, considering the turmoil at the club – Weah landed in
  Marseille. If the idea was to find some consistent playing time in a World Cup
  year, he will attempt to do so at a club that is perpetually in chaos. As
  usual, OM have signed a raft of new players – many of them attackers. It isn’t
  hard to see this going sideways for Weah, who has taken a big gamble. LS Gio
  Reyna to Borussia Mönchengladbach. Everyone in American soccer should be
  rooting for Reyna’s move to work out. He needed to go somewhere, with the path
  to minutes not open at Borussia Dortmund. Yet, it has been years since Reyna
  played consistently, and it’s not immediately clear if he’ll be doing that a
  quick trip down the road from Dortmund. The move is a better fit than his loan
  to Nottingham Forest, but we’re still in “see it to believe it” mode with
  Reyna after he started just five games last season. JA The good news is that
  nobody’s transfer fills me with dread. That said, the success of multiple
  moves remains uncertain, especially those of Reyna and Weah (hence their
  presence on both sides of this question). There’s nothing too dire right now,
  but the future is unclear. MS Which under-the-radar USMNT player abroad should
  people be watching? Johnny Cardoso at Atlético Madrid. It’s tricky to make the
  case that the only US national teamer to ever play for Atlético Madrid is
  “under the radar.” But after a totally forgettable summer during which his
  Gold Cup campaign with the US was ruined by injury and a comical giveaway that
  gifted Turkey a goal in a friendly, it feels like a lot of people will have
  written Cardoso off. Yet there is a reason one of Europe’s biggest clubs was
  steadfast in wanting him in the Spanish capital this season and made him their
  second-most expensive signing in a summer spending spree. Even if it’s
  sometimes hard to figure out where Cardoso would fit into the America
  midfield, he’s worth another look. LS Taylor Booth at FC Twente. There was a
  time not that long ago when an American starting every week for a decent Dutch
  team would have drawn a considerable amount of attention on certain message
  boards and corners of social media. Now, the shifty Booth seems to coast under
  the radar, with Americans at even bigger clubs in the Netherlands and abroad
  drawing the attention. After an injury and inconsistencies slowed his
  progression, the 24-year-old is not in the picture for the 2026 World Cup
  squad. If he continues to grow at Twente however, the Bayern Munich academy
  product could play a role post-2026. JA Aidan Morris at Middlesbrough. The
  former Columbus Crew homegrown is putting in work with Middlesbrough in the
  Championship. The USMNT midfield talent pool is dense, though, with the
  23-year-old has making just eight appearances for the USMNT since 2023 and
  none since 2024. But Morris is worth a watch and his stock could rise in the
  future. MS Who, if anyone, is most likely to move to MLS in one of the next
  two windows? Weston McKennie. The FC Dallas academy player spent part of his
  childhood in Germany and is clearly comfortable getting dropped into new
  environments. But he also seems to openly pine for home more than any other
  American abroad. When he isn’t devastating his Juventus teammates with his
  shocking food takes, or upsetting the other locals, McKennie muses about
  opening a Chick-fil-A, Chili’s or Wing Stop in Italy. He has his agent bring
  him ranch dressing from the US whenever he visits. If some MLS team throws him
  an enormous contract, in the style of Clint Dempsey or Michael Bradley before
  the 2014 World Cup, it isn’t hard to see McKennie returning stateside. LS
  Bryan Reynolds. The FC Dallas product wants out from Westerlo, and had the
  rumored move to FC Cincinnati come off, it would’ve put him in a much better
  place to make a late charge for Pochettino’s 2026 squad than if he sticks in
  Belgium – or even if he moves elsewhere in Europe, where he’ll need to fight
  an established player for minutes. This winter will provide another chance for
  Reynolds to try to contend with the other right-back depth options. JA Gaga
  Slonina. The 21-year-old goalkeeper has – through injury, form, and mixed
  results as part of the Chelsea loan army – yet to find his footing overseas.
  It’s possible he may stay abroad a bit longer – it must be emphasized that, at
  the age of 21, he’s still very young for a goalkeeper. But he’ll need to
  return home eventually if things don’t change. MS
