  It’s been five years since the start of the Covid pandemic. Although most of
  the government mandates, from social distancing to face masks, have been
  consigned to the past, the virus is still prevalent – and capable of causing
  real harm. Although it was initially forecast to become a seasonal illness,
  the virus is on the rise in the US – making it far from the common-cold-style
  winter illness that was expected. Experts said a lot of predictions made about
  how Covid-19 would evolve have turned out to be wrong. Five years on, what do
  we know about the virus? Is Covid on the rise? Although news of a summer wave
  in the US has led to fears it could be replicated in the UK, the latest data
  from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that cases dropped by 28%
  over the past week to reach 1,046. Since most people don’t test any more, this
  is unlikely to reflect the true prevalence. The data for the past year shows
  levels have remained consistent, with a large spike last October. Is it a
  seasonal illness? Experts assumed that as Covid became endemic, it would
  change into a winter bug, like the common cold or flu. UKHSA stats show this
  is not the case. “It is absolutely true that you are as likely to get Covid in
  summer as in winter,” said Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College
  London. He added: “It’s been a shifting discussion – when do we calm down and
  say it’s become an endemic coronavirus like the common cold. I think we’re
  still so far off that place. There’s a kind of optimism that it’s just a
  winter sniffle, but it’s not a sniffle; it’s quite symptomatic, especially in
  vulnerable people and in the excess death figures, and also it is absolutely
  not seasonal.” Altmann said that, although there is a perception that, as a
  coronavirus, Covid-19 is akin to a common cold, in reality it is closer to the
  flu in terms of the death rate, its impact on the NHS and the potential
  severity of symptoms. Simon Williams, a sociologist at Swansea University who
  has researched public views on the pandemic, said: “We’re getting to the point
  where there’s a legitimate question about whether it will ever be [a winter
  virus]. It’s not a typical respiratory virus in terms of seasonality.” Adam
  Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical
  Medicine, said that because Covid-19 evolves quickly – twice as fast as the
  fastest flu – it is less constrained by season. “Whereas a small change in
  transmissibility conditions is enough to stop flu in summer, Sars-CoV-2 can
  basically evolve its way over this barrier,” he said. Which variant are we on
  now? The main Covid viruses in circulation are the Omicron subvariants. These
  are “obviously milder than Wuhan or Delta”, Altmann said, adding it’s not the
  case that they are becoming progressively milder, but rather population
  immunity is higher owing to vaccines and prior infections. The newest variant,
  NB.1.8.1, has been detected in the UK and international data suggests it is
  growing as a proportion of all Covid cases. World Health Organization analysis
  found the new strain is more contagious, but vaccination gives significant
  protection. Williams said we can expect to keep seeing the virus evolve,
  similar to how there are new flu virus combinations each year. Should we all
  get vaccines? The experts agreed the main problem is the low take-up of the
  free vaccine, which is available to people at greatest risk from Covid
  infection, including those aged 75 and over and those who are
  immunocompromised. Altmann said anyone who could afford it may wish to pay for
  the vaccine – not least because he hears regularly from new long Covid
  sufferers: “Who wouldn’t feel safer with boosted neutralising antibodies and
  T-cells?” He noted there is a spectrum of suffering, with people who are
  infected occasionally and mildly or non-symptomatically on one end, and on the
  other, those living with long Covid. There is also a third, under-researched,
  group in the middle of young or middle-aged people who get four to six
  reinfections each year, and may have to take several days off work each time.
  “It’s non-trivial and makes it quite hard to do your work,” he said. Although
  there is still hybrid immunity in the population because most people received
  several vaccines during the pandemic, there is a growing population of
  children who would have been too young to have received them at the time. The
  experts feared that growing vaccine hesitancy, which Williams described as
  “one of the most pressing concerns” in public health, could have an impact on
  whether these children receive a jab or people turn up for their boosters.
  Another consideration, when it comes to building immunity, is the growing body
  of research suggesting that for several months after a Covid infection, people
  become more vulnerable to other infections and there can be lingering effects
  on the heart, cardiovascular system and the brain. “We’re only five years into
  this virus, there’s a lot of question marks and unknowns,” said Williams.
