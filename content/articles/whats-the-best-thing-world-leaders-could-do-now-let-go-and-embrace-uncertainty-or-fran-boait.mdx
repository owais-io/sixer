  If there is one thing that has marked the first year of Keir Starmer’s
  premiership, it is a propensity for control – whether it’s managing his own
  party, cracking down on civil liberties and protest, or instilling fear and
  anxiety in marginalised groups. For a centre-left party, the authoritarian
  strain Starmer has shown isn’t exactly in line with the “change” from the
  Tories that was promised. Governments seek to control populations, politicians
  seek to control their parties: this is nothing new and has been explicitly
  promoted since Machiavelli’s The Prince was published in 1532. When leaders
  understand holding power as an end in itself, and see the method as
  controlling those they have power over, they block themselves from being able
  to bring about real change, because not “losing control” becomes more
  important than any change they seek to create. And attempting to tightly
  control outcomes is ill suited to an increasingly complex and unstable world.
  At the same time, a different mode of control exists across the institutions
  that implement government policy. It is rules-based, promoted by steeply
  hierarchical structures fostering compliance, with rigid frameworks and
  inflexible mindsets, alongside a culture of overconfidence. These dynamics
  might seem benign or indeed necessary for a functioning bureaucracy. However,
  if out of balance, they can stifle the creative thinking and collaboration
  required to tackle complex challenges. Whether it is running consultations
  without the intention of deep engagement or listening, or an inability to
  incorporate the climate crisis into economic frameworks, by seeking to
  maintain control, institutions fall short of making meaningful change. Or to
  put it bluntly, key performance indicators and top-down thinking, combined
  with overzealous control freakery in government, will not have a chance of
  tackling climate breakdown, the cost of living crisis, the mental health
  epidemic or the loss of trust in politics. This situation of overlapping
  crises is what academics like to call a polycrisis, characterised by radical
  uncertainty and wicked complexity. Coming out of the pandemic, there has been
  increased discussion among policymakers recognising the need to acknowledge
  uncertainty. The value of this is clear: a report commissioned by the European
  Environment Agency and published in 2002 examined more than 100 years of
  policymaking, highlighting areas where uncertainty was not sufficiently
  acknowledged or taken into account when key decisions were made, such as
  during the BSE crisis. The authors concluded that, on many occasions, what was
  missing was the need for more humility in public policymaking about what was
  not known, stating: “Decision-making is faced with the continual prospect of
  surprise. This is the condition formerly known as ignorance.” When
  institutions don’t acknowledge what they don’t know, they are left exposed and
  unprepared, and leaders obsessed with control and certainty block themselves
  from taking seriously differing perspectives. These dynamics are not well
  suited to a world that is being upended, with fascism and ecological collapse
  on our doorstep. However, the need for certainty and control isn’t confined to
  the halls of power. Across psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, evolutionary
  biology and strands of spirituality, it is recognised that our brains are
  wired for certainty. Neuroscience studies show that the brain responds to
  uncertainty as a fear-based threat, triggering the threat response centre
  called the amygdala. There is an evolutionary survival reason for this, to
  detect and react to danger: “How will I protect myself if I don’t know what’s
  coming at me?” Humans’ over-alert threat response is also shaped by culture
  and society. We have a political-media establishment that is happy to pump out
  ready opinions that are not only factually baseless and untrue, but also
  provoke our threat response. And in times of economic decline and uncertainty,
  there is an opportunity for far-right groups to hijack and trigger emotional
  and psychological reactions towards marginalised groups. When imaginary fears
  are adopted and promoted by those in power, this isn’t a mistake: it is a way
  to control. The dominant mode of power that continues to operate in society,
  and certainly in the Labour party today, is “power over”, which is built on
  control, domination and coercion. Leadership exerts pressure and stress, which
  can often make our amygdala threat response fire off. People become paranoid
  and go into overdrive trying to control everything. To an extent, I understand
  these responses. As an overconfident 27-year-old when I took on a director
  role, I certainly had an urge to control everything. I had to work hard
  against that tendency in order to lead in a collaborative way. The phrase
  “holding uncertainty” was useful for me, because it meant I didn’t always
  trust my first reaction in situations, or the narratives my brain was telling
  me. It reminded me to take on board different opinions, rather than simply
  dismiss them. Of course I made mistakes, but I was also open to examining my
  own controlling and perfectionistic tendencies. “Embracing uncertainty” or
  “letting go” has been mostly limited to the pages of self-help books, but
  letting go on an individual level doesn’t make sense if you can’t pay your
  rent, or your family is getting deported. However, if we apply it to our
  institutions, power centres, systems and structures, it can be a direction of
  travel against authoritarianism, moving us towards co-creation, pluralist
  thinking that goes beyond siloed categories, and building coalitions against
  the far right. We are a quarter of the way through this century, and the IPCC
  climate change report says that global temperature increase could be up to
  5.7C by 2100, making much of the world unliveable. At the same time, fascism
  is on the rise. Renewing our democracies, shifting to a healthier culture,
  tackling the climate crisis and reorienting the economy will only happen if we
  shift our culture and institutions away from control. We need to let go. What
  have we got to lose? Fran Boait is a leadership coach, freelancer and writer
