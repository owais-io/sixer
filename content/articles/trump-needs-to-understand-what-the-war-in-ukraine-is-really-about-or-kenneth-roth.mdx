  It may be difficult for a real-estate mogul like Donald Trump to recognize,
  but Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not about slices of war-torn land
  in eastern Ukraine. It is about Ukraine’s democracy. Putin fears that the
  Russian people will see that democracy as an enticing alternative to his
  stultifying autocratic rule. Trump is unlikely to secure a peace deal unless
  he acts on that reality and changes the cost-benefit analysis behind Putin’s
  continuing war. Much of the public analysis of the Alaska summit between Trump
  and Putin, and the Washington collection of European leaders protecting the
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from the temperamental Trump, has
  been replete with red-herring issues. For example, Putin did not invade
  Ukraine because of feared Nato expansion. The unanimous consent of all Nato
  members required to admit Ukraine is nowhere on the horizon, especially since
  article 5 of the Nato treaty would require all Nato members to defend Ukraine
  from the ongoing Russian incursion. Ironically, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine
  has strengthened Nato. It encouraged Sweden and Finland to join the alliance.
  It led Nato members to vow to dramatically increase their defense expenditures
  to 5% of their gross domestic product. And it has made some Nato members more
  likely to deploy troops in Ukraine as part of a “reassurance force” to secure
  a possible peace deal. Nor did Putin invade to liberate the Ukrainian people
  from the rule of Zelenskyy, whom he regards as illegitimate and even a
  “neo-Nazi”. This claim is rich because Zelenskyy was chosen in a free and fair
  election, but Putin risked only an electoral charade while imprisoning,
  ultimately lethally, his most charismatic opponent, Alexei Navalny. And the
  war is not about Putin’s pining to resurrect the Soviet Union, whose collapse
  he sees as “the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. That logic
  would endanger the other 13 former Soviet states, three of which – Estonia,
  Latvia and Lithuania – are Nato members. Rather, Putin invaded Ukraine to
  quash its democracy. Unlike the established democracies of Europe, Ukraine
  looks too much like Russia for Putin to ignore the possibility that Russians
  will see an alternative future in its accountable, elected government. Like
  Russia, Ukraine is Slavic and Orthodox. And far from a small statelet,
  Ukraine, with the second largest population among post-Soviet states after
  Russia, cannot be ignored. Putin has long preferred Ukraine as a Kremlin
  vassal state. The Euromaidan protests of 2013-14, which ousted Ukraine’s
  pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych after he suspended talks for a closer
  relationship with the European Union, led to Putin’s seizure of Ukraine’s
  Crimea and parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Today, Putin’s most
  controversial demands would enhance the possibility of Kyiv’s renewed
  subordination. His insistence that Ukraine hand over large portions of Donetsk
  province – the “land swaps” that Trump casually suggests – would relinquish
  far more land than Russia has managed to take by force since November 2022, at
  enormous cost in Russian soldiers’ lives – land that had been home to hundreds
  of thousands of Ukrainians. It would also compel Ukrainian forces to abandon
  key defensive lines – Ukraine’s “fortress belt’’ – that stand in the way of
  Russian seizure of much larger chunks of territory. Comparisons with Neville
  Chamberlain’s 1938 appeasement of Adolf Hitler by sacrificing Czechoslovakia’s
  Sudetenland – a prelude to war – would be inevitable. Putin’s demand that
  Ukraine disarm would make Russia’s further aggression even easier. Precluding
  that possibility is why security guarantees are so important for Ukraine.
  Given that Putin has a history of ignoring agreements with Ukraine, Kyiv
  reasonably wants some assurance that the Russian military will not use a lull
  in the fighting to replenish its diminished forces, rearm and reinvade. The
  best guarantee would be a European peacekeeping force on the ground, but
  European governments understandably seek a US backstop to deter Russian
  attack. Trump’s stated willingness to consider air support for a European
  force is an important step forward. The Russian government’s insistence on the
  power to veto any security guarantees raises obvious questions about Putin’s
  intentions. For now, Putin seems to see advantage in continuing the war. To
  avoid angering Trump, he hasn’t outright refused to meet with Zelenskyy but is
  slow-walking the matter by insisting on time-consuming prior steps. Given that
  Putin’s quest to undermine Ukraine’s democracy stems from his calculation of
  what it takes to retain power, the only way to soften his maximalist demands
  is by making his recalcitrance even more politically costly. This is where
  Trump has a role to play. Entering the Alaska summit, Trump had threatened
  “severe consequences” if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. The mercurial
  Trump then seemingly abandoned that threat after a few hours with Putin. Trump
  could take various steps that would force Putin to recalibrate the rationale
  for his war. Trump could increase the supply of arms to Ukraine. He could
  further use tariffs to deter the sale of oil and gas that prop up the Russian
  military. He could press European governments to devote to Ukraine’s defense
  and rebuilding the $300bn of sovereign Russian assets that are now frozen in
  western accounts. It is deeply disturbing that matters of war and peace,
  democracy and autocracy, depend on stroking and flattering the fragile ego of
  the self-absorbed Trump. But that is the world we live in. European leaders
  have an essential role to play in nudging him in the right direction. They
  must get Trump to overcome his usual disdain for democratic rule, and
  admiration for autocrats like Putin, to acknowledge the centrality of
  defending Ukraine’s democracy for any fair resolution of the Ukraine conflict.
  These are counterintuitive steps for the American president. But if he wants
  to orchestrate an end to the horrible slaughter in Ukraine, he will have to
  summon the vision to take them. Kenneth Roth, former executive director of
  Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School
  of Public and International Affairs. His new book, Righting Wrongs: Three
  Decades on the Front Lines Battling Abusive Governments, was published by
  Knopf and Allen Lane
