  Five million extra online age checks a day are being carried out in the UK
  since the introduction of age-gating for pornography sites, according to new
  data. The Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA) said there had been a
  sharp increase in additional age checks in the UK since Friday, when age
  verification became mandatory for accessing pornography under the Online
  Safety Act. “As a result of new codes under the Online Safety Act coming into
  force on Friday, we have seen an additional 5m age checks on a daily basis, as
  UK-based internet users seek to access sites that are age-restricted,” said
  Iain Corby, the executive director of the AVPA. The UK has also seen a surge
  in popularity of virtual private networks, which obscure a user’s real
  location and thus allow them to access sites blocked in their own country.
  Four of the top five free apps on the Apple download store in the UK are VPN
  apps, with Proton, the most popular, reporting a 1,800% increase in downloads.
  Last week the UK’s communications regulator and enforcer of the act, Ofcom,
  indicated that it could start formal investigations into inadequate age
  checking this week. Ofcom said it would be actively checking compliance with
  age-checking requirements and if necessary would launch investigations into
  individual services. The AVPA, the trade association for age-verification
  companies in Britain, surveyed members who were carrying out checks for UK
  pornography providers. These providers were required to introduce “highly
  effective” age verification on 25 July. The age-checking companies were asked
  to submit “the volume of checks you carried out today for highly effective age
  assurance”. The AVPA said it could not offer a baseline comparison but
  effective age assurance was new to dedicated pornography sites in the UK.
  Previously, many porn sites in the UK only required users to tick a box to
  verify their age. An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Until now, kids could easily
  stumble across porn and other online content that’s harmful to them without
  even looking for it. Age checks will help prevent that. We’re now assessing
  compliance to make sure platforms have them in place, and companies that fall
  short should expect to face enforcement action.” Ofcom has said service
  providers should not encourage users to deploy VPNs in order to circumvent age
  controls. Punishments for breaching the Online Safety Act, including for
  inadequate age-checking procedures, range from 10% of worldwide revenue to
  blocking access to the site or app in extreme cases. Age-assurance methods
  supported by Ofcom and offered by AVPA members include facial age estimation,
  where technology assesses a person’s likely age through a live photo or video;
  checking a person’s age via their credit card provider, bank or mobile phone
  network operator; photo ID matching, where a passport or similar ID is checked
  against a selfie; or a “digital identity wallet” that contains proof of age.
  Major pornography providers including Pornhub, the UK’s most popular
  pornography site, have pledged to implement the strict age checks required
  under the act. The act also requires sites and apps to shield children from
  other forms of harmful material, particularly content that encourages suicide,
  self-harm and eating disorders. It requires tech platforms to suppress the
  spread of content that is abusive or incites hatred against people with
  protected characteristics under the Equality Act such as age, race and sex.
  Free speech campaigners have said the child-harm content restrictions have led
  to material on X being age-gated unnecessarily, along with some forums on
  Reddit including one dedicated to tackling alcohol abuse. Reddit and X have
  been contacted for comment.
