  In July and August, many parts of southern Europe and the Med are too hot and
  too crowded for comfort. But as summer turns to autumn it’s not just the
  temperature that drops – prices are lower too, and visitors get to experience
  a gentler, more relaxed side to places as the season starts to wind down. We’d
  love to hear about your favourite late-season sunshine escapes. The best tip
  of the week, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet wins a £200 voucher to stay
  at a Coolstays property – the company has more than 3,000 worldwide. The best
  tips will appear in the Guardian Travel section and website. Keep your tip to
  about 100 words If you have a relevant photo, do send it in – but it’s your
  words we will be judging for the competition. We’re sorry, but for legal
  reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. The competition
  closes on Monday 1 September at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and
  other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using
