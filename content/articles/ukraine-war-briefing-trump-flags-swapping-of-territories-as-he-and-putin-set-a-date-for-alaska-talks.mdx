  set a date for Alaska talks

  Donald Trump has said any peace deal between Ukraine and Russia would involve
  territory swaps, as he named a date and location for talks with Vladimir
  Putin. The US president said: “But we’re gonna get some [territory] back.
  We’re gonna get some switched. There’ll be some swapping of territories, to
  the betterment of both.” He did not provide further details. Kyiv did not
  immediately comment on the talks or the possibility of territorial exchanges.
  Trump said he planned to meet the Russian president next Friday in Alaska. He
  announced the location in a brief post on his Truth Social site. Russian state
  media agency Tass confirmed the date and location of the meeting, citing
  Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov. Putin said earlier he was not ready to meet
  Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after the proposal of a three-way
  meeting by US envoy Steve Witkoff. “I have nothing against it in general, it
  is possible, but certain conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a
  meeting with Zelenskyy. “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating
  such conditions.” Ushakov said another summit with the US president could be
  held in Moscow, and said an invite had already been extended. The White House
  has not commented yet on the remarks. The US president’s remarks on Ukraine
  came after Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said a “freeze” in the
  conflict could be close, after speaking with Zelenskyy, who has communicated
  with Trump and European leaders in recent days. “There are certain signals,
  and we also have an intuition, that perhaps a freeze in the conflict – I don’t
  want to say the end, but a freeze in the conflict – is closer than it is
  further away,” Tusk said during a news conference. Ukraine’s president said
  late on Friday that Kyiv was in “constant communication with the American
  side” as the deadline for a Russian ceasefire passed. Zelenskyy said “No
  orders to stop have been given to the Russian army” and that the day had seen
  more than 100 drone strikes on Ukraine, as well as frontline assaults and
  other airstrikes. He added that all Ukraine’s allies were “united in the
  understanding that there is a chance to achieve at least a ceasefire, and that
  everything depends on the right pressure on Russia”. Viktoriia Roshchyna, the
  Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian captivity last year, has been buried
  in Kyiv, in a ceremony attended by relatives and colleagues who paid tribute
  to her singular professional courage and the importance of her work. Roshchyna
  was reporting on Russia’s systematic policy of extrajudicial detention and
  torture in occupied parts of Ukraine before falling victim to it herself. She
  died at the age of 27 last year in murky circumstances, after more than a year
  in Russian captivity. Her body was returned earlier this year with some of the
  internal organs missing.
