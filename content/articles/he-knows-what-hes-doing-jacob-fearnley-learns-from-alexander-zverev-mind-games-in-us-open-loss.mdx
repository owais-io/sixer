  Even before Jacob Fearnley entered Louis Armstrong Stadium for his clash with
  Alexander Zverev on Thursday night in New York, the mind games had already
  begun. In the build up to their US Open second round match, the third seed
  kept Fearnley waiting for more than 10 minutes before finally showing up for
  their match, where he defeated Fearnley 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the third
  round. Despite competing hard and showing flashes of his talent by attempting
  to dominate the baseline with his forehand and close down the net, Fearnley
  ended his first US Open main draw appearance with another valuable lesson
  against one of the best players in the world. Across their 2 hours and 28
  minutes on court, Zverev ground the Briton down with his consistency, solid
  counterpunching and dominant serving, outplaying his more volatile opponent by
  giving away so few points easily. “I think it was pretty obvious what I was
  trying to do – come to the net and disrupt his rhythm – because I think he’s
  just very, very solid and he’s not going to give me much,” Fearnley said. “And
  then I was obviously fluctuating, and it’s tough to kind of keep that level
  throughout the whole match. And I gave myself chances, but I just didn’t
  capitalise. Obviously he’s a great player, so can’t be too disappointed, I
  guess.” This match also provided a glimpse into the gamesmanship that top
  players sometimes implement against lower-ranked opponents. Before each
  contest at the US Open, players must congregate outside a corridor inside
  Arthur Ashe Stadium that leads to each court. When their names were called
  over the loudspeaker, Fearnley immediately appeared at 6.50pm. He would spend
  another 10 minutes waiting quietly for his opponent. Zverev was ordered on
  three occasions to report for his match before he finally arrived. Asked if he
  was irritated by his opponent’s tardiness, Fearnley hesitated before choosing
  his words carefully. He noted that top players often move at their own pace,
  which he learned for the first time before his match against Novak Djokovic at
  Wimbledon last year. “I kind of expected it,” Fearnley said. “I mean, it was
  the same [against Zverev] in Australia, and he kind of is always like, ‘I’m
  sorry about that’, but he knows what he’s doing. It was the same with Novak in
  Wimbledon. They take their time, which is, I don’t know if it’s within the
  rules or not. “I don’t really know what the rule is, I just don’t. But … If
  they call me, I show up, because I don’t know necessarily what’s going to
  happen. But no, he’s well within his right to take his time. I kind of
  expected it. My coach expected it. Every time I played him, he kind of did the
  same.” Fearnley is still just 14 months into his career as a professional
  player and the 24-year-old is still in the process of gaining experience each
  week. Alongside his considerable potential, he has certain shortcomings to
  address. After striking 18 double faults in his four-set first round win over
  Roberto Bautista Agut, against Zverev he struck 12 double faults, including on
  numerous important points. “In practice, I can sit there all day and make 100
  second serves in a row,” he said. “It’s not an issue. But there’s just
  something about seeing the lights, seeing the courts, that gets a little bit
  tricky. And also having Alex Zverev on the other side of the net, and with
  that noise, that crowd, it’s sometimes difficult. “I’ll keep working on it but
  I’ll figure it out eventually. I know there’s a lot of players that have had
  similar things in the past, but they’ve seemed to work through and I’m sure
  I’ll do the same.”
