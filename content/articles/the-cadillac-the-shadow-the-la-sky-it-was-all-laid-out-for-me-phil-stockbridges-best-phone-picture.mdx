  ‘The Cadillac, the shadow, the LA sky – it was all laid out for me’: Phil
  Stockbridge’s best phone picture

  His usual way of taking photos, Phil Stockbridge says, is like an angler
  waiting for a fish. The LA-based photographer had been working on a commercial
  shoot on the day he landed this image. “When I find something interesting to
  shoot, the main thing that starts to churn in my brain is light and
  composition. A lot of the time the subject’s missing and I’ll sit and wait
  like a fisherman for the right person or car to make the image. Luckily, for
  this scene, it was all laid out for me.” Stockbridge believes this to be a
  Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, and notes how he was drawn by “the shadow of a
  parking sign, the street lamp in the distance, the LA sky, a slouched fence
  and the edge of the sidewalk. A Long Beach day turning into a Long Beach night
  is on full display here. The traffic’s dying down, it’s getting quieter,
  cooler. The sun has set and all that’s left of it remains in the dark blue
  sky.” Stockbridge took the image on his phone, later applying edits using VSCO
  and Lightroom. “I hope someone seeing this feels a calm washing over them,” he
  says, “but I never take photos with the intention of making the viewer feel
  something. That stuff finds its way afterwards.”
