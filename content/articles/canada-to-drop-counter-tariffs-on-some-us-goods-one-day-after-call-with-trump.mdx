  Canada will drop its counter-tariffs on some American goods in the coming
  days, Mark Carney has said, as the country’s prime minister looks to end a
  protracted trade war with longtime ally the United States. From 1 September,
  the Canadian government will remove some levies on US goods that comply with
  the North American free-trade pact, a move meant to “match” how the White
  House treated Canadian goods. Levies on steel, aluminum and autos will remain
  in place. The announcement comes one day after Carney and Donald Trump spoke
  on the phone. In recent months, the US has upended global trade as it seeks to
  bring manufacturing jobs back and sign more favourable deals with trading
  partners. Carney said despite the global turmoil and American tariffs on
  Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, lumber and energy, 85% of Canada’s
  trade with its southern neighbour was tariff-free. “Let’s be absolutely clear:
  Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States, and while
  it’s different from what we had before, it is still better than that of any
  other country,” he said. “As we work to address outstanding trade issues with
  the US, it is important we do everything we can to preserve this unique
  advantage for Canadian workers and their families.” When Trump’s aggressive
  tariff plans sparked a trade war earlier this year, relations between the two
  nations chilled. Washington and Ottawa had long been positioned as close
  allies on trade and defense. Canada has imposed retaliatory tariffs on US
  goods three times. Those counter-tariffs covered $60bn worth of consumer
  goods. Canada’s federal government also imposed tariffs on American-made cars.
  The governing Liberal party has also pledged government support for sectors
  disproportionately affected by American economic protectionism, and in an
  effort to reduce Canada’s reliance on the US as a trading partner. Despite
  hints of a detente in recent weeks, including talks between Carney and Trump
  this week, Canada and the US failed to reach a set of terms by Trump’s 1
  August deadline that would reshape a longer-standing relationship. In late
  July, Carney said Canada was unlikely to convince Trump, who sees tariffs as a
  useful and powerful cudgel, to drop all levies on Canadian goods. In a
  statement, the White House called the move “long overdue” and said Carney’s
  overture paved the way for “continuing our discussions with Canada on the
  administration’s trade and national security concerns”.
