  Tasmania’s Liberal government has been recommissioned after weeks of political
  limbo after a snap election that failed to deliver either major party a
  majority. The premier, Jeremy Rockliff, met with the governor, Barbara Baker,
  on Wednesday at Government House to formally ask for his minority government
  to remain. Baker accepted the request after Rockliff told her he expected to
  gain the confidence of the lower house, the governor said. Just hours after
  the premier was reappointed, the state’s Labor leader, Dean Winter, said a
  motion of no confidence would be tabled on the first day of the new
  parliament, either by Labor or a crossbencher. “It is clear we need a
  parliament that will work together and Tasmania Labor stands ready to work
  with the crossbench to deliver Tasmanians a stable parliament and a stable
  government that can last four years,” Winter said. “Tasmanians can be assured
  that any motion we move will not result in another election, it will result in
  either a Liberal government or a Labor government.” Rockliff said on Wednesday
  he would serve as premier for a full four-year term. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email “Through sensible communication, everyone working together, pragmatism,
  working together on policies, working together in the best interests of
  Tasmanians, this is a government and a parliament that will last the full
  term,” he told reporters after the governor confirmed his appointment. “What
  we want to do, by evidenced of today, is get on with the job,” He said he had
  taken “learnings” from the previous parliament which was cut short by a vote
  of no confidence. “We want to build on the progress that was made in terms of
  how parliament works for the betterment of all members of parliament and, of
  course, that means the betterment of all Tasmanians. And move forward.” In a
  statement, the governor explained why she appointed Rockliff despite his
  inability to demonstrate a majority backing in parliament. “In a hung
  parliament, where no one clearly holds the confidence of the majority of the
  House of Assembly, the incumbent has the right to remain in office in order to
  test the numbers in the House of Assembly and for parliament to have the final
  say in who should be premier,” Baker said. “I consider the convention of
  incumbency applies in the current circumstances. “I shall reappoint the
  premier. “It is better for confidence to be determined inside and not outside
  the parliament.” Rockliff and his cabinet are set to be sworn in next week,
  before state parliament returns in a fortnight on 19 August. The governor said
  the detailed reasons for her decision would be published on her website later
  on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Rockliff said he had not secured supply and
  confidence agreements with key crossbenchers but thought it was “not
  necessary” in this instance. The final makeup of Tasmania’s parliament is 14
  Liberals, 10 Labor, five Greens, one Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP and five
  independents. The 19 July election was triggered after Rockliff lost a
  no-confidence motion, prompting the state’s second election in 16 months. A
  key sticking point in forming government is the major parties’ backing of a
  new $1bn stadium in Hobart, which the Greens and some independents oppose.
