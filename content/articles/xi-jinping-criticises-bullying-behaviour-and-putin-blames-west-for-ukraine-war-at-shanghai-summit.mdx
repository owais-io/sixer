  Xi Jinping has criticised the “bullying behaviour” of other countries while
  Vladimir Putin has blamed the west for his war on Ukraine, on the second day
  of a major summit in China which seeks to challenge western-led multilateral
  blocs. The Shanghai Cooperation Summit (SCO) began in the city of Tianjin on
  Sunday, with Xi welcoming dozens of leaders from Eurasian member states and
  other partner and observer countries, including Putin, and Indian prime
  minister Narendra Modi. In a speech to delegates on Monday, Putin claimed the
  war was not triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but
  was “a result of a coup in Ukraine, which was supported and provoked by the
  west”. “The second reason for the crisis is the west’s constant attempts to
  drag Ukraine into Nato,” the Russian president added. Russia’s
  three-and-a-half year war has killed tens of thousands of people and
  devastated much of eastern Ukraine. Putin’s remarks followed a speech by Xi,
  who said “the security and development tasks facing member states have become
  even more challenging”, and urged them to “oppose cold war mentality, bloc
  confrontation, and bullying”. “We must uphold the international system with
  the United Nations at its core and support the multilateral trading system
  with the World Trade Organization at its core.” Xi praised the growth of the
  SCO, saying they were building a new model of “true multilateralism”. He urged
  further cooperation of member countries in leveraging their “mega-scale
  markets” to boost trade and investment, and said China would provide 2bn yuan
  ($280m) of free aid to member states this year and a further 10bn yuan of
  loans to a SCO banking consortium. The Tianjin summit is the biggest SCO
  meeting since it was formed in 2002, and is a key part of Beijing’s push to
  challenge the dominance of US or western-led groups such as Nato. That effort
  has been boosted by the global upheaval caused by US president Donald Trump’s
  tariffs and other foreign policy changes. Among the attendees is India’s
  leader Modi, on his first visit to China in seven years. The two nations had
  long traded hostilities over a Himalayan border dispute, trade, and China’s
  support for India’s rival Pakistan. But the meeting on Sunday, five days after
  Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi’s
  purchases of Russian oil, showed the relationship was thawing. Xi said
  China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on
  viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported. Xi,
  Putin and Modi were seen chatting on live footage, the three leaders flanked
  by their official translators. In his remarks on Monday, Putin also praised
  the efforts of China and India “aimed at facilitating the resolution of the
  Ukrainian crisis”. Many of the assembled dignitaries will be in Beijing on
  Wednesday to witness a military parade marking 80 years since the end of the
  second world war. The event will also be attended by North Korean leader Kim
  Jong-un. On Monday, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi said that the summit had
  issued a statement calling for the international community to uphold the
  “correct” perspective on world war two and said that SCO members had fought
  side by side in that conflict. In recent months China has highlighted its
  role, alongside the Soviet Union’s, in defeating Japan and Germany in the
  second world war. Analysts will be closely watching for any formal meeting
  between Putin, Xi and Kim. North Korea’s assistance to Russia’s war is
  believed to have rankled Xi, who is trying to balance its Russian alliance
  with avoiding any further punitive responses from the US over the war in
  Ukraine. “It is publicly known that North Korean soldiers are already present
  on the Ukrainian battlefield, and Russia and North Korea have close military
  cooperation. If all three were to meet, it would be very striking to the
  United States, highlighting a potential new cold war dynamic,” said Lim
  Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at
  the University of Tokyo. “If such a meeting does not take place, it is likely
  because China does not want to overly provoke the US while maintaining a
  certain degree of triangular ambiguity.” Additional research by Lillian Yang
