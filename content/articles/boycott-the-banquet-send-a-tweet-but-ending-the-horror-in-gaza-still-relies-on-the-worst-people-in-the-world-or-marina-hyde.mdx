  Day 222 of Donald Trump’s presidency, and Russia’s war in Ukraine – which he
  promised to end on day one – shows no sign of having got the memo. This was
  not a single-use Trump promise; he made it at least 53 times. Yet the US
  president has failed to keep it, either literally or in his favourite manner:
  figuratively. Can you figuratively end a war? Not even, apparently. What his
  most recent round of failure means, however, is that Trump is pivoting back to
  another war, the grotesquely horrifying and unlawful humanitarian catastrophe
  unfolding in Gaza. Not the way he’d phrase it, possibly. This week he swerved
  commenting on either Israel’s invasion of Gaza City or the mounting
  declarations that famine and starvation are clearly under way in the
  territory, and instead announced: “I think within the next two, three weeks,
  you’re going to have a pretty good, conclusive ending.” Righto. Trump’s recipe
  for an ending to the horror has hitherto seemed to resemble the famous
  business plan of the South Park gnomes. Phase 1: Collect Underpants. Phase 2:
  ?. Phase 3: Profit. In the US president’s version, this ran along the
  following lines. Phase 1. Grotesquely horrifying and unlawful humanitarian
  catastrophe. 2. ? 3. Beach resort. Strange to look at the Yalta conference
  photo of Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt and think how much more quickly the
  three allied wartime leaders could have wrapped things up had they shunned
  various complexities and understood the world as a simple selection of
  waterfront real-estate opportunities. And yet, perhaps even stranger to
  imagine that while we don’t have a group selfie of Donald Trump, Vladimir
  Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu, the curse of our times is that the fate of so
  many appallingly desperate and persecuted people in the world hinges on three
  men who might well be imagined to be in jail were they not in office. But
  these are the realities. The path to peace in Gaza runs through Trump, not
  social media posts, or window flags, or creatives “using their platform”, or
  any of the other gestures that, while the wishful might cast them as speaking
  truth to power, in fact only throw our era’s increasingly pervasive sense of
  powerlessness into even sharper relief. Nor, in any non-gnome sense, does it
  run anywhere near Ed Davey’s announcement this week that after much thought
  and prayer, he would not be attending the king’s banquet for Trump during his
  forthcoming state visit. It goes without saying that Trump wouldn’t have the
  first clue who the Liberal Democrat leader is. (More pressingly for Davey, and
  perhaps more in his power to do something about, is the polling this week that
  showed that 35% of his own Lib Dem voters also haven’t the first clue who he
  is when shown a photo of him.) But Davey believes boycotting dinner is the
  best way he can “send a message to both Trump and Starmer” that they cannot
  wish the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza away. He means well, yet this gesture
  still feels one rung above a tweet – or, indeed, a Guardian newspaper column,
  which is how he announced it. Regrettably, neither of the above are levers in
  international conflict. Being unable to plot a path to answers means a
  question dominates our turbulent age: is being well-meaning enough? Is it, in
  fact, all I can be? Have I acquitted my responsibilities in the face of
  historic horror by posting about it, or attacking someone else for not posting
  about it, or by suggesting that someone cannot care about any subject on which
  they have not done a post? Perhaps it’s nice to think so, but I fear that far
  from being the most engaged, those who live like this are the most beaten.
  Some of the worst people in the world – at least, some of the worst people
  without access to state armies – run the social media companies, and the idea
  that spending comfortable hours policing their platforms, working for them for
  free, is taking a stand or showing you care in any useful way tips beyond
  bizarre into cultural sickness. Social media claimed to connect and empower
  people – a populist promise if ever you heard one – and yet what many of us
  hear our friends and family say all the time in conversations about the news
  is that they feel powerless. People have been atomised and narcotised by this
  supposedly unifying and uplifting technology, and when the great perspective
  of history is afforded to our descendants and perhaps even our future selves,
  we might well find that most of our present crises were catalysed by it rather
  than cured by it. This morning I saw a much-shared cut-out of Travis Kelce
  kissing Taylor Swift in their engagement photo, superimposed on top of a
  war-demolished building, above a bell hooks quote: “All our silences in the
  face of racist assault are acts of complicity.” Dear me. Stick it in a time
  capsule, along with an apology note for the cultural rubble it’ll have to be
  dug out of. At operational level, however, things don’t change. The path to
  peace still goes through politicians with power. Many of them are still
  terrible people. They will still have to have unpleasant and even “toxic”
  conversations in which horse-trading and moral compromise are inevitable. And
  yet these things are still desirable, because this is the way it has always
  ended. This is the way the bombs go silent, the way the children stop
  starving, the way the hideous carnage ends. It is a long, perilous and
  precarious path – but history has made it familiar, because it is the only one
  that actually gets anywhere near where we need to go. Marina Hyde is a
