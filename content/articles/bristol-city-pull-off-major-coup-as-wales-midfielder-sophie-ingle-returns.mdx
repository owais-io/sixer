  Bristol City have signed the Wales midfielder Sophie Ingle on a free transfer
  in a move that takes her back to the club she first joined 11 years ago. Ingle
  left Chelsea, the Women’s Super League champions, when her contract ended last
  season after a trophy-laden, seven-year spell in which she won five league
  titles, three Women’s FA Cups and two League Cups, and her move to the second
  tier will be one of the highest-profile WSL 2 signings of this window. She had
  been an integral part of the Chelsea side that has dominated the WSL era,
  before suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury last September. She
  returned to the pitch in time to go to Euro 2025 as part of Wales’s squad and
  played in their group-stage fixture against France in Switzerland, capping a
  hard-fought journey back to the pitch after 281 days on the sidelines. A
  former Wales captain, she has 142 senior international caps for her country
  and also played for Team GB at the Olympics in Japan in 2021. She also awarded
  an OBE in 2023 for services to football. The 33-year-old will return to play
  for the club she represented in the 2014/15 campaign – when the women’s
  leagues used a summer calendar and the club were known as Bristol Academy –
  before joining Liverpool, where she was twice the players’ player of the year.
  Bristol City are understood to not have been the only club that attempted to
  sign Ingle this summer, but she was ultimately attracted to the club’s
  ambition as they seek to mount a promotion push. She has signed a two-year
  contract, with a further year’s option. Her arrival will add to a busy summer
  at Bristol City, who appointed Charlotte Healy as their head coach in June.
  Healy moved to Ashton Gate after six years working at Manchester United, where
  she ultimately became the assistant coach to the manager, Marc Skinner. She
  has also coached at Liverpool and Manchester City. She replaced Steve Kirby,
  who left Bristol City in May after the team finished second in the
  Championship, which has since been renamed as WSL 2. Ingle said: “After
  speaking to Charlotte and [hearing] everything that the club offers both on
  and off the pitch, it felt like a good fit. The club wants to get promoted and
  I love winning. It is going to be tough in this league, but I want to get back
  playing to the best I can and offer as much as I can for this team.” Liverpool
  have named Gareth Taylor as their head coach on a long-term contract. Taylor
  was identified as the first choice earlier this summer but his appointment was
  delayed by the need to resolve a matter relating to his contract at his former
  club Manchester City, who sacked him in March. Taylor replaces Matt Beard, who
  left in February. The interim head coach, Amber Whiteley, is among the staff
  working under Taylor, who won an FA Cup and League Cup at City. “Everyone in
  football knows about the history, size and potential of this club,” Taylor
  said, “and I am really looking forward to the task ahead.” City have signed
  the goalkeeper Eartha Cumings from Rosengård on a three-year deal. The
  26-year-old Scot’s previous clubs include Liverpool and Charlton.
