  Angela Rayner has confirmed she underpaid stamp duty on her recent purchase of
  an £800,000 flat in Hove. In a highly personal statement, the deputy prime
  minister said she had classified the flat as her primary property for tax
  reasons under the advice of lawyers. But having taken further advice in recent
  days from a “leading tax counsel”, she now believes she should have paid the
  higher rate, which would be as much as £40,000 more. Rayner also revealed
  details of her family situation publicly for the first time, having received
  permission to be freed from the bounds of a court-imposed injunction. Angela
  Rayner’s statement in full “Following the substantial scrutiny surrounding my
  living arrangements, I wanted to set out the facts as openly and transparently
  as I can. “Until now, an undertaking in a court order prevented me from
  disclosing information about certain aspects of my personal life. In the
  interests of public transparency, I applied to the court and I was last night
  released from this undertaking. “Family life can be complicated, and it is no
  secret that, like many families across the country, my domestic arrangements
  reflect these complexities. Throughout my career, I have always tried to be
  the best mum to my children, while managing the demanding realities of public
  service. “There has been a lot of speculation in recent days about my domestic
  arrangements and in particular the home I share with my ex-husband and my
  family. While I do not find it easy to publicly discuss personal and sometimes
  distressing family matters, I have always taken my responsibility as an MP and
  deputy prime minister seriously and tried to be as open as possible while
  protecting my family. To address the allegations made against me I have now
  taken the difficult decision to explain why my arrangements are as they are.
  “In 2023 my ex-husband and I divorced. As parents who have been through
  divorce will understand, the top priority for both of us during that process
  was the wellbeing of our children and helping them navigate this change. To
  provide maximum stability during this transition, we agreed to a nesting
  arrangement where the children remain in the family home full-time while we
  alternate living there. We also wanted to ensure that our child, who has
  special educational needs, was provided for as part of the divorce settlement.
  “A court-instructed trust was established in 2020 following a deeply personal
  and distressing incident involving my son as a premature baby. He was left
  with lifelong disabilities, and the trust was established to manage the award
  on his behalf – a standard practice in circumstances like ours. “To ensure he
  continued to have stability in the family home, which had been adapted for his
  needs, we agreed that our interest in the family home would be transferred to
  this court-instructed trust of which he is the sole beneficiary. “Some of the
  interest in our family home was transferred to the trust in 2023. In January
  2025, I sold the remaining interest in the property to my son’s trust. This
  will give him the security of knowing the home is his, allowing him to
  continue to live in the home he feels safe in and grew up in. We transferred
  the property because it was in the best interests of our child. I acted as any
  parent would. “The sale of the property in Ashton-under-Lyne to the trust has
  not altered my family life. It remains my family home, as it has been for over
  a decade. It contains the majority of my possessions and it is where I am
  registered for most official and financial purposes ranging from credit cards
  to the dentist to the electoral roll. But most importantly, it is where my
  children live and have gone to school and now college, and where I regularly
  live while caring for them. “After I sold my stake to the trust, I bought a
  property in Hove in May 2025. Like many people, I used the lump sum from
  selling my stake in my Ashton home, which was the only property I owned and
  where my savings were, for the deposit on my new one. I obtained a mortgage to
  finance the rest. When purchasing the property my understanding, on advice
  from lawyers, was that my circumstances meant I was liable for the standard
  rate of stamp duty. “However, given the recent allegations in the press I have
  subsequently sought further advice from a leading tax counsel to review that
  position and to ensure I am fully compliant with all tax provisions. I have
  now been advised that although I did not own any other property at the time of
  the purchase, the application of complex deeming provisions which relate to my
  son’s trust gives rise to additional stamp duty liabilities. I acknowledge
  that due to my reliance on advice from lawyers which did not properly take
  account of these provisions, I did not pay the appropriate stamp duty at the
  time of the purchase. I am working with expert lawyers and with HMRC to
  resolve the matter and pay what is due. “The arrangements I have set out
  reflect the reality that family life is rarely straightforward, particularly
  when dealing with disability, divorce, and the complexities of ensuring your
  children’s long-term security. Every decision I have made has been guided by
  what I believe to be in my children’s best interests. “I deeply regret the
  error that has been made. I am committed to resolving this matter fully and
  providing the transparency that public service demands. It is for that reason
  I have today referred myself to the independent adviser on ministerial
  standards, and will provide him with my fullest cooperation and access to all
  the information he requires.”
