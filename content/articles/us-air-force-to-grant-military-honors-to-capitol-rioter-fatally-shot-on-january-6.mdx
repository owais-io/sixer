  The US air force will provide military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, the
  rioter fatally shot during the January 6 Capitol attack, marking another step
  in Donald Trump’s aggressive rehabilitation of the attack. The under secretary
  of the air force, Matthew Lohmeier, confirmed the decision in an August letter
  to Babbitt’s family. The Biden administration previously denied Babbitt the
  honors, but Lohmeier said he was “persuaded that the previous determination
  was incorrect” after reviewing new information about her death. Babbitt, 35,
  served in the air force and air national guard and was shot by Capitol Hill
  police as she climbed through a barricaded door near the House chamber in the
  mass frenzy to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. The air force had
  originally refused honors in February 2021, according to Lohmeier’s letter,
  saying they would “bring discredit upon the Air Force” due to the
  circumstances of her death. She was the only person killed by gunfire during
  the riot. The announcement, made public Wednesday by conservative legal group
  Judicial Watch, follows a nearly $5m wrongful death settlement the government
  paid Babbitt’s family in July. Trump has systematically worked to reframe
  January 6 since returning to office. On his first day back, he pardoned
  approximately 1,500 defendants connected to the riot, calling their
  prosecutions “a grave national injustice”. The pardons covered nearly all
  those jailed or awaiting trial, including extremist group leaders sentenced
  for seditious conspiracy. The administration has fired dozens of federal
  prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases and hired lawyers who previously
  defended rioters, including one who compared the prosecutions to the
  Holocaust. The justice department also hired former FBI agent Jared Wise, who
  participated in the attack and was charged with encouraging the mob to kill
  police officers before receiving a Trump pardon. Trump has repeatedly called
  the rioters “patriots” and “political prisoners”, framing the assault on the
  Capitol as legitimate protest rather than an attempt to overturn the 2020
  election. The systematic reversal extends beyond pardons to a wholesale
  reimagining of January 6 as political persecution rather than criminal
  conduct. Babbitt owned a pool business with her husband in San Diego. She
  traveled alone to Washington DC for Trump’s “Save America” rally before
  joining the raid on the Capitol. The military honors will include a ceremony
  with taps and the presentation of an American flag to her family. Lohmeier
  also invited Babbitt’s mother and husband to meet him at the Pentagon.
