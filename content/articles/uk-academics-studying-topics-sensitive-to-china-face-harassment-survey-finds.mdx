  Academics and students of Chinese studies in Britain are being subject to
  harassment, surveillance and pressure to self-censor as they seek to avoid
  disruption to funding, a survey of universities by a transparency group has
  concluded. The findings by UK-China Transparency coincide with new government
  guidance stating that universities may be breaching rules by having
  partnerships with foreign governments that require academic staff to pass
  ideological tests – for example, by hosting Confucius Institutes. Academics
  working on topics that are politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist
  party (CCP) reported instances of harassment from colleagues and pressure from
  university administrators related to the financial consequences of damaging
  relations with China. One academic involved in sensitive research stopped
  teaching after experiencing harassment from a visiting scholar from China, who
  whispered “we’re watching you” in one case and interrogated the academic about
  their personal history at another event. Another scholar experienced a severe
  campaign of online harassment. A respondent stated that their Chinese students
  had confided in him that they had been asked to spy on campus events by
  Chinese police, and another said they were told by Chinese students that
  surveillance was omnipresent and that students were interviewed by officials
  on their return to China. The results suggest that the academic landscape is
  mixed, with some institutions demonstrating higher resilience and supporting
  scholars working on sensitive topics than others. They are based on 50
  responses to a questionnaire circulated last year among China studies scholars
  working at UK universities. Nearly two-thirds – 64% – of respondents thought
  their universities’ financial dependency on international students from China
  affected administrators’ “sense of the importance of relationships with the
  Chinese government”, compared with 16% who felt that this was not the case.
  Twenty-two per cent said they had been told by a manager or administrator that
  relations with China were a factor in their institution’s decision-making, and
  a further 10% said they believed they were, while 52% said they were not. And
  38% thought these concerns made it “more difficult to study or conduct
  original investigative research on sensitive issues”, compared with 46% who
  said this was not the case. One academic said they had faced pressure to
  remove teaching elements that could offend nationalist Chinese students and
  had been asked by funders whether planned research would offend the Chinese
  government. The same academic said their university’s recruitment team had
  received threats from the Chinese government in relation to their sensitive
  research. Another respondent said their faculty had been opposed to a
  sensitive event and another gave a secondhand account of an incident at
  another university where a research project had been cancelled and its funding
  returned because of Chinese government pressure on the university’s
  management. Other respondents argued that specialising in sensitive research
  work created opportunities, with one respondent suggesting that in the current
  environment “a strongly anti-Chinese stance” could create “a stifling effect
  on those who wish to discuss nuance”. Another respondent said that “sensitive
  topics are welcomed by some institutions but not others”. A Chinese embassy
  spokesperson said: “The relevant report is completely groundless and absurd.
  China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in other
  countries’ internal affairs, and respects freedom of speech and academic
  freedom in the UK and other countries. China consistently requires its
  citizens, including overseas students, to abide by local laws and regulations.
  “The relevant parties should remain committed to actions that promote
  educational and cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and the UK,
  rather than the opposite.” David Tobin, a lecturer in east Asian studies at
  the University of Sheffield, said the report was “addressing long-term
  pervasive issues in British universities that I’ve encountered since 2007”. He
  said he had experienced one incident in a previous job where a senior
  colleague invited representatives from the Chinese consulate and Chinese state
  media journalists to visit. After being left to wander around the building
  unattended, he said they entered his working area and observed the sensitive
  material he was working with on his computer screen. “The key challenge
  academics like myself researching subjects that are considered sensitive by
  the CCP is that our access to the field is blocked if we write about anything
  that the party state does not approve of,” Tobin said. “Chinese scholars here
  are as afraid as they would be in China because they are not protected when
  they are at home and their families are harassed inside the PRC [China] if
  they write about the party system.”
