  A fisher who recently went out on the Mississippi River in Minnesota ended up
  spotting a submerged car and evidently helped solve a nearly 60-year-old
  missing person case, according to authorities and local news reporting. Brody
  Loch, the fisher at the center of the remarkable chain of events, told the
  Minneapolis news outlet WCCO that he called authorities after discovering the
  1960s-era Buick in question with a sonar device on the weekend of 9 August. By
  Wednesday in the community of Sartell, local sheriff’s office divers and a tow
  truck crew had recovered the vehicle. And investigators processing the car
  found human remains inside, the office of Steve Soyka, the Stearns county
  sheriff, said in a statement. Furthermore, Soyka’s agency said, through the
  car’s vehicle identification number (VIN), investigators were able to
  determine the car belonged to Roy Benn, who at age 59 was reported missing to
  the sheriff’s office of nearby Benton county in September 1967 – and had not
  been seen since. Officials have sent the remains in Benn’s car to a medical
  examiner’s office for possible identification. Nonetheless, based on the items
  in the car and its VIN, Soyka’s office said it believed the remains were that
  of Benn. Soyka’s office added that it had turned the case over to the Benton
  county sheriff’s office. Benton county’s sheriff, Troy Heck, told CNN that his
  office had notified Benn’s remaining family, who had previously been asked for
  DNA samples. “We’re just grateful that we may likely have finally gotten the
  break that we needed to bring closure to this family,” Heck said to the
  network. A missing persons bulletin published by Minnesota’s public safety
  department said Benn was last seen on 25 September 1967 while “carrying a
  large sum of money”. He was also driving his 1963 four-door, metallic blue
  Buick Electra, said the bulletin, which described the car missing alongside
  Benn. Benn owned an appliance repair service in St Cloud, Minnesota, when he
  went missing, according to reports at the time from the local daily newspaper.
  The St Cloud Daily Times also reported that Benn’s wife had died the year
  before he went missing. Benn’s brother, Walter, worked with authorities
  investigating Roy’s disappearance, but leads back then never materialized into
  something definitive, as CNN reported. Walter Benn moved to sell his missing
  brother’s personal possessions at an auction in 1968, the St Cloud Daily Times
  reported. Roy Benn was then declared legally dead in 1975, about eight years
  after he was last seen, the St Cloud Daily Times’ reporting showed. After
  finally being located, Benn’s car was “filled with river sediment” and
  “severely deteriorated” from being underwater for decades, yet it was
  “intact”, Sartell’s municipal police department said in a statement. Loch told
  WCCO that he hoped Benn’s family was finally closer to getting meaningful
  answers about what happened to him. He attributed it to good fortune that he
  and the friend with whom he was fishing didn’t float by Benn’s car without
  detecting it on sonar that fateful day. “It was 100% luck,” Loch said.
