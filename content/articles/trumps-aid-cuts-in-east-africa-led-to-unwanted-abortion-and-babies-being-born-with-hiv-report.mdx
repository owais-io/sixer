  Aid cuts in east Africa have led to cases of babies being born with HIV
  because mothers could not get medication, a rise in life-threatening
  infections, and at least one woman having an unwanted abortion, according to
  interviews with medical staff, patients and experts. A report by Physicians
  for Human Rights (PHR) sets out dozens of examples of the impact of disruption
  to Pepfar – the president’s emergency plan for aids relief – in Tanzania and
  Uganda. Pepfar, a leading US global health programme, launched in 2003 and is
  credited with saving millions of lives, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The
  report is based on interviews with 39 doctors, nurses, people living with HIV,
  service providers and other experts. It focuses on the first 100 days after
  Pepfar-funded programmes were instructed to stop work as part of a US
  government freeze on foreign aid. Health workers reported shortages of drugs
  to control the virus, resulting in increased serious infections in people
  living with HIV and children being born with the virus because mothers could
  not get medication to prevent it being passed on. Clinics have closed, and
  people are skipping vital doses to eke out their supply of medication, raising
  the risk of drug-resistance. Some programmes have been able to resume
  activities in the months since the interviews, said Emily Bass, one of the
  report’s authors, offering “temporary mitigation” of the harms, but there
  exists a “narrow window” for the US Congress to act to secure resources that
  will stabilise remaining services and prevent the loss of decades of progress.
  The Trump administration is reportedly refusing to release about half of the
  $6bn (£4.5bn) funding allocated by Congress for Pepfar in the 2025 fiscal
  year. In Tanzania and Uganda, HIV prevention and treatment programmes were
  reliant on Pepfar. The stop work order meant clinics were unable to dispense
  drugs bought with US money for several days, before a waiver came through
  allowing treatment to continue. Even then, disruption to supply chains meant
  doctors could not dispense as many drugs as usual, they said, perhaps giving
  patients supplies for a few weeks rather than months. Rumours spread that
  normal access was unlikely to return. A mental health project research
  coordinator told PHR: “Someone did an abortion because of that rumour [that
  antiretrovirals were no longer available]. She said, ‘Oh well, I don’t want to
  have a baby who is HIV positive. I will be blamed myself, so I don’t want.’”
  By late April, one clinic reported that 25% of the pregnant women living with
  HIV that it supported had given birth to a child with HIV. Its clinician said
  drugs had not been delivered and existing stocks would not stretch far enough.
  The US government waiver allowed HIV prevention programmes to continue only
  for pregnant or breastfeeding women. It left key at-risk groups unprotected –
  in Tanzania and Uganda, LGBTQ+ people, sex workers and people who use drugs
  face criminalisation and stigma. Specialist services making it easier for them
  to access care have been hardest hit, the report found, warning of worsening
  discrimination when those people sought help from mainstream government
  clinics. The report also found that people’s trust in domestic government, US
  foreign aid and antiretroviral medications had been damaged. Many said they
  feared a “dark” future, anticipating increased costs for care and opportunists
  pushing fake cures. The US government must “immediately restore, renew,
  preserve and protect global health funding for essential HIV services,
  including full funding commensurate with need for global HIV programs in the
  FY 2026 budget, and subsequently reauthorise the Pepfar program”, the authors
  concluded, so that there can be “a planned, feasible, and transparent
  transition to country leadership and ownership of programs”.
