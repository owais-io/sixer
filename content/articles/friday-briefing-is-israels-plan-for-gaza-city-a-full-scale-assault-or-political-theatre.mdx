  Good morning. Israel claims to have launched the first stages of a sweeping
  military operation to conquer Gaza City – the administrative heart of the
  strip – warning that a million people could be forced from their homes,
  sparking a wave of fear among residents. In the past few nights Palestinians
  have described relentless bombardments, with thousands already scrambling to
  escape, while others are too starved or frail to evacuate. International
  condemnation has poured in, with disgust at the starvation, destruction and
  mounting civilian toll – in Israel, hundreds of thousands of protesters have
  filled the streets demanding a ceasefire. Yet the military is doubling down on
  attacks. Officials have made daily announcements about the plan to conquer
  Gaza City, but it remains unclear whether a full-scale offensive is actually
  afoot. For today’s newsletter I spoke with senior international reporter Peter
  Beaumont to get a clearer idea of Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan and how much of
  what he says can be trusted. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories UK
  news | Protesters at the next mass demonstration against the ban on Palestine
  Action will withhold their details from officers to force en-masse processing
  at police stations in an effort to make it “practically impossible” to arrest
  everyone. Ukraine | Moscow threw Donald Trump’s Ukraine peace initiative into
  disarray on Thursday, insisting it must have a veto over any postwar support
  for the country as its forces carried out a large-scale overnight missile
  barrage. Immigration | Refugee support organisations have been forced to
  install safe rooms in their premises, relocate to less visible sites and in
  some cases close their offices in response to the threat of far-right
  violence, the Guardian can reveal. US news | A federal judge in Miami late on
  Thursday ordered the closure of the Trump administration’s notorious
  “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail within 60 days and ruled that no more
  detainees were to be brought to the facility while it was being wound down.
  Health | Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the
  quality of their products in England amid mounting concerns that leading
  brands are nutritionally poor. In depth: ‘Experienced Israeli analysts seem
  genuinely baffled about what’s going on’ In early August, Israel’s
  political‑security cabinet approved a military plan to take control of Gaza
  City, which they claim is a Hamas stronghold. The plan involves the call-up of
  roughly 60,000 reservists starting from early September. Sources from the Gaza
  municipality say that the situation in Gaza City is “catastrophic”. The
  population is extremely weak and many are unlikely to have the strength to
  undergo another displacement. “We were talking to a friend in Gaza yesterday
  who was saying you won’t recognise me any more, I’ve lost so much weight,”
  said Peter Beaumont. “Some are leaving Gaza City, but other people say they
  just can’t do it any more.” The military claims it is displacing the
  population “to ensure their safety”. It has not said when the mass
  displacement would begin, but medics have been told to prepare by the Israeli
  military. “The IDF hasn’t made preparations to accommodate the displacement of
  a million people. It just hasn’t. It isn’t effectively feeding and caring for
  the people who are already displaced,” Peter said. Five out of six
  Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians, figures
  from a classified Israeli military intelligence database suggest. This extreme
  rate of slaughter has been rarely matched in recent decades of warfare. The UN
  humanitarian agency has warned the Israeli plan to expand military operations
  in Gaza City – home to around 500,000 people – would have “a horrific
  humanitarian impact”. *** Truth, lies, and calculated misdirection Israeli
  officials have made announcements saying the plan to conquer Gaza City has
  been “approved”, with preliminary actions already under way. “Everything
  that’s been said about this operation at the moment has to be taken with a
  pinch of salt,” said Peter, who wrote yesterday that when dealing with Israeli
  officials – and Netanyahu in particular – filtering out what is true, what is
  lies, and what is calculated misdirection is a complicated business. The talk
  of a large-scale IDF operation could primarily be intended to put pressure on
  the militant group in ceasefire talks. “All that’s actually happened is that
  they’re renewing the availability of reservists. All it means is that they’ve
  been told to be available for call-up,” said Peter. “One should always be very
  cautious about what is being said, especially in statements that are clearly
  fishing for headlines.” On Thursday evening Netanyahu said on a visit to
  Israeli soldiers that he would give final approval for taking control of Gaza
  City, but also said he was looking to restart negotiations with Hamas to end
  the war on terms acceptable to Israel. “It’s pretty incoherent leadership,”
  says Peter. Politically it seems like a strange move from the Israeli PM.
  “It’s not clear to me how the politics of it plays out,” said Peter.
  “Experienced Israeli analysts who have been covering security and Netanyahu
  for years seem genuinely baffled about what’s going on.” One key point is that
  the public are against the takeover of Gaza City as they understand it will
  likely lead to the death of the surviving 20 hostages, with relatives
  describing it as a “death sentence” for them. Another is that the ceasefire
  deal Hamas has agreed to is essentially the same as the one Israel signalled
  its agreement for only weeks ago. Hamas said Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza
  City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a truce. “Normal
  people are getting tired,” Peter said. “Netanyahu hasn’t delivered any of the
  successes he claimed he would, and we’re nearly two years into a war.” By the
  end of 2024 – now more than eight months ago – the economic toll of Israel’s
  ongoing war on Gaza had already reached $67.57bn. “The cost of maintaining it
  is hurting Israel economically. It’s a small country with a relatively small
  number of soldiers and reservists available to it. People are getting
  exhausted by the war,” said Peter. There are reports of suicides among
  soldiers, and complaints that they are not getting treatment for PTSD.
  “Israel’s response, as far as I can see, is just simply to be more and more
  aggressive,” said Peter – perhaps epitomised by a social media post from the
  Israeli ambassador to Canada at the end of July: “Israel will not bow to the
  distorted campaign of international pressure against it.” “It’s very hard to
  see what victory Netanyahu could wrap himself in, which is presumably why he’s
  talking about pressing on with the Gaza City plan,” said Peter. “It’s about
  the sunk cost fallacy: ‘Just one more effort will get us to that other
  thing’.” Or so he hopes it will. *** An impending avalanche If the operation
  to conquer Gaza City does go ahead, it will lead to humanitarian disaster,
  said Peter. “If you think international criticism is bad at the moment, it
  will be an absolute avalanche,” he explained. On 8 August, Germany announced
  it was halting its export of arms to Israel following announcement of the Gaza
  City plan, indicating a significant shift in Berlin’s staunch support for
  Israel, with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, just one of a number of
  European leaders to condemn the decision after Netanyahu first announced his
  offensive on Gaza City despite intense international pressure to reach a
  ceasefire agreement. On the ground in Gaza City, people have spoken of their
  terror of what is to come following relentless overnight bombardments. “The
  house shakes with us all night long – the sound of explosions, artillery,
  warplanes, ambulances, and cries for help is killing us,” one resident, Ahmad
  al-Shanti, told AFP. “The sound is getting closer, but where would we go?” And
  as all of this plays out on the world stage, international outrage is growing
  – indicating that perhaps world leaders will soon no longer be willing to look
  away. “All the old certainties for governments – about having to try and
  accommodate Israeli aggression – are falling away,” Peter said. “Given where
  public opinion is and given how privately sick many politicians are of all
  this now, I think it would be very hard to see Israel avoiding big, meaningful
  sanctions going forward. And I think even Israelis recognise that.” What else

  for the weekend Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play
  and listen to right now TV Hostage | ★★★★☆ Netflix’s new political thriller is
  a rollicking, propulsive and compulsive yarn that also manages to give two
  great parts to two women of a certain age (Suranne Jones and Julie Delpy,
  above) then leaves them to get on with it as characters rather than symbols.
  Everyone is terrific, with Jones doing her usual sterling work. I do find
  myself occasionally wishing that she would treat herself and us to a comedy –
  or something with a comic aspect – more often, but when the dramas are this
  much fast, furious, intelligent fun, I suppose we shouldn’t ask for more. Lucy
  Mangan Music Linda May Han Oh: Strange Heavens | ★★★★☆ The title Strange
  Heavens unerringly nails this music. The title track’s whispering,
  short-phrase melody blossoms amid Oh’s caressing pizzicato and drummer Tyshawn
  Sorey’s spacey rimshots. Meanwhile, Acapella’s delicately descending passages
  are embraced by bass flurries and hissing cymbals; and Ambrose Akinmusire (on
  trumpet) is in his most rhythmically Miles-inspired on the staccato,
  hip-hoppish Noise Machinery. The guilelessly delicate Paperbirds is a
  highlight, as is the soaringly rhapsodic Folk Song. John Fordham Film
  Meanwhile on Earth | ★★★★☆ Here is a French indie sci-fi in which a woman,
  Elsa, mourns her brother Franck, who is missing and presumed dead in space,
  which makes him rather less likely to be found again. One day, Elsa encounters
  Franck once more – as a voice. It seems that an alien presence may be able to
  return him to his home planet, if Elsa is prepared to help them out with a
  little favour … A Hollywood blockbuster would perhaps resolve this dilemma
  quickly, but here it is the meat of the film, a kind of thought experiment,
  and Elsa’s plausible wrangling with her decision is what enables a fine
  performance from Northam. Catherine Bray Theatre Fat Ham | ★★★★☆ The Swan,
  Stratford-upon-Avon until 13 Sep If you’ve ever felt Hamlet needs less gore
  and more glitterball, then tuck into Fat Ham. James Ijames’s play won a
  Pulitzer prize in 2022; set at a southern back yard barbecue, its sensibility,
  Black and queer, does more than piggyback on Shakespeare’s tragedy. Audiences
  seeking Shakespeare references will be in hog heaven: the conscience-catching
  play becomes a game of charades, and people keep catching Juicy mid-soliloquy
  and wonder what secrets he’s spilling. Ijames’s writing is full of charm and
  crackle, and there’s a bravery in his refusal to valorise tragedy or trundle
  through inherited trauma. David Jays Today in Focus Cringe! Why millennials
  became so uncool An intergenerational war has broken out with Gen Z
  mercilessly mocking millennials as embarrassing and out of touch. Chloë
  Hamilton reports Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good
  news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Jean-Charles Levenne has
  answered prayers across Paris by developing an app that helps people find the
  sunshine, pinpointing exactly which bistrot terraces guarantee a sun-certified
  evening apéritif. The app, Jveuxdusoleil (I want sun) highlights sunny
  terraces on its map using open-source data from OpenStreetMap, while shady
  spots disappear. Users are able to feed back when the app is inaccurate, or
  when certain spots aren’t mentioned. Jveuxdusoleil reports a steady 1,300
  active users per week, with app usage spiking during spring when Parisians are
  desperate to bask in some light. And despite being predominantly
  Paris-focused, the app functions worldwide, so there is hope for us all. Sign
