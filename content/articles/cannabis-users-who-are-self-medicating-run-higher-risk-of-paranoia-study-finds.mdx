  People who start smoking cannabis to alleviate pain, anxiety or depression are
  at a higher risk of developing paranoia than those who use the drug
  recreationally, a study has found. The research analysed answers from 3,389
  former and current cannabis users aged over 18, who had no clinical history of
  psychosis and had taken part in the Cannabis&amp;Me survey. Published in BMJ
  Mental Health, and led by academics at King’s College London, the research
  found that those who started using cannabis to self-medicate for a condition
  such as pain, anxiety or depression, and if they were experiencing minor
  psychotic symptoms, had higher paranoia scores, while those with the lowest
  scores used cannabis for fun or because they were curious. The survey also
  found that the average respondent consumed 206 units a week of
  tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis, the equivalent
  of between 10 and 17 joints, but people who used cannabis for anxiety or
  depression reported consuming 248 and 254.7 units respectively. Only people
  with very rare forms of epilepsy, adults with nausea caused by chemotherapy
  and some people with multiple sclerosis are able to get an NHS prescription
  for medicinal cannabis in England. “I think lots of people who now know that
  cannabis can cause psychosis, they say ‘these people are not like me’. That’s
  not true,” said Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatric research at King’s
  College London. “What we can show in this study is that the effect of cannabis
  is a bit like the effect of alcohol or the effect of food, that it’s a
  dimension. So the more you take, the more problems you get into. “Contrary to
  what it says on the internet, cannabis is not medicinal. We now have 40
  private clinics up and down the UK dishing out cannabis supposedly as a
  treatment, and the things that they are giving it for are pain, anxiety and
  depression predominantly. And these are the things that we find are related to
  people getting into trouble and becoming more paranoid.” Dr Emily Finch, the
  chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ addiction faculty, said: “These
  important findings reinforce previous work which suggests that cannabis can
  have significant adverse effects on users’ mental health. Society must be more
  aware of the substantial evidence on cannabis harms, and correct the
  widespread misapprehension that cannabis is not an addictive substance.
  “Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the UK, and around a
  third of people who use cannabis develop a problem with the drug at some point
  during their lives. This is similar to the proportion of people who will
  develop a problem with alcohol. “The use of both natural and ‘synthetic’
  cannabinoids over the long term risks addiction and severe co-occurring mental
  illness harms. Daily cannabis use is associated with depression, anxiety and
  reduced motivation. “Daily users of high-potency cannabis are nearly five
  times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than people who have never
  used cannabis, with adolescents at particular risk. “As a priority, the UK
  government must provide substance use and mental health services with the
  training, staff and funding they need to support people with co-occurring
  substance use and mental illness. This must also include a focus on providing
  early treatment to the increasing number of children and young people
  struggling with substance misuse if we are to reduce long-term harms.” A
  separate study published in the journal Psychological Medicine analysed the
  same survey, and found 52% of cannabis users had experienced some kind of
  childhood trauma, and that those who had experienced physical and emotional
  abuse had paranoia scores around 35-40% higher. Respondents who reported
  experiencing sexual abuse as a child consumed more THC on average, followed by
  those who had experienced physical and emotional abuse.
