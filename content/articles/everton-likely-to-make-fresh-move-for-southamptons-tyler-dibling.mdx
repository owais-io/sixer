  Everton are likely to make a fresh move for Tyler Dibling and are hopeful of
  clinching a deal for the winger, whose departure would boost Southampton’s
  chances of preventing Mateus Fernandes from joining West Ham. Southampton are
  holding out for at least £50m for Fernandes – West Ham’s latest bid was £30m
  plus £2m in add-ons, up from last week’s effort of £28m plus £2m in add-ons –
  and will be in an even stronger financial position if funds are raised through
  the sale of Dibling. Everton have been biding their time since their previous
  offer for the 19-year-old, which was about £40m, and are understood to be
  preparing another bid. Southampton have hoped to receive £50m for Dibling, who
  is open to joining Everton, but there is optimism that a compromise will be
  reached on a fee for the teenager. Signing the England Under-21 international
  would be a major boost for David Moyes, who has already added Thierno Barry,
  Jack Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to his attack. But it would
  potentially be bad news for West Ham given that selling Dibling would harden
  Southampton’s position on Fernandes. The south coast club are bidding for an
  instant return to the Premier League and have shown little indication of
  dropping their asking price for the Portuguese midfielder. Fernandes is a key
  target for West Ham but they have been frustrated in their attempts to sign
  the 21-year-old. They are scrambling to add energy and creativity in midfield
  but are struggling to land their top targets. West Ham have made a bid for
  Barcelona’s Marc Casadó but that has been described as a difficult deal to
  pull off, while an approach for Andrey Santos was dismissed by Chelsea earlier
  this week. Graham Potter is hunting for midfield reinforcements after West
  Ham’s frailties were exposed during their 3-0 defeat by Sunderland on the
  opening weekend of the season. Potter is looking for two midfielders – one to
  sit deep and control play, another to operate in a more advanced role – and
  Casadó has been identified by the club’s recruitment team. The 21-year-old
  made 36 appearances in all competitions for Barça last season. Wolves are also
  interested in the player. West Ham hope to make space in their budget by
  loaning Edson Álvarez to Fenerbahce. The Mexico midfielder, who earns
  £115,000-a-week, has not made up his mind on whether to join the Turkish side.
  Porto and Borussia Dortmund are also interested in Álvarez. West Ham have made
  four signings this summer and are monitoring Romano Schmid, who plays in
  attacking midfield for Werder Bremen. Schmid is a potential alternative to
  Fernandes. West Ham expect to move forward with other targets if Álvarez goes.
  Feyernoord’s 24-year-old midfielder Quinten Timber - the twin brother of the
  Arsenal right-back Jurrien - is one of the names on West Ham’s radar.
  Meanwhile, Bournemouth are closing in on the signing of Amine Adli after an
  agreeing a fee of £25m plus bonuses with Bayer Leverkusen for the Morocco
  forward. It is understood that Adli, who was part of the Leverkusen side that
  went unbeaten in the 2023-24 Bundesliga season, is due to complete his medical
  shortly and will sign a five-year contract. The 24-year-old made almost 100
  appearances for Leverkusen and is targeting a place in Morocco’s squad for the
  Africa Cup of Nations, which they are hosting, later this year.
