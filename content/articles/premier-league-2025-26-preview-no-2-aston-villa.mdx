  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 5th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben
  Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 6th Prospects For Aston Villa supporters, the postcards from last
  season are worthy of repeated viewing. There were memorable trips to Berne,
  Bruges, Leipzig, Paris and Monaco as Unai Emery’s side enjoyed an absorbing
  ride to the Champions League quarter-finals, and nobody of a claret-and-blue
  persuasion will forget the home triumph over Bayern Munich anytime soon. Then
  there was the run to the FA Cup semi-finals, though a comprehensive defeat to
  Crystal Palace at Wembley delivered a sting. There were plenty of positives,
  chiefly the continued emergence of Morgan Rogers, now one of the Premier
  League’s most coveted players, and the consistent class of Youri Tielemans
  behind him in midfield, and yet it was a campaign tinged with disappointment.
  Villa missed out on qualifying for Europe’s elite competition on goal
  difference after defeat at Manchester United on the final day and Emery’s hunt
  for silverware – he outlined his desire to win a trophy on arrival in
  Birmingham almost three years ago – goes on. Villa imploding in the Europa
  Conference League semi-finals two years ago, losing 6-2 on aggregate to
  Olympiakos, hurt but now Emery returns to a competition that he knows best:
  the Europa League. Villa have been transformed under Emery but is there room
  to grow? Except the arrival of Marco Bizot from Brest, the 34-year-old
  goalkeeper signed as a No 2, Villa are yet to sharpen their squad, even if the
  Dutchman appears a smart buy given they paid a six-figure fee. They lost out
  to Manchester City in the race of Sverre Nypan and were primed to move for the
  Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who is now poised to join Paris
  Saint-Germain, if a club met the asking price for Emiliano Martínez. Improving
  a strong squad is not straightforward, especially in the era of profitability
  and sustainability rules. Villa’s spine – spearheaded by Ollie Watkins –
  matches that of most division rivals; Harry Kane is the only Englishman to
  register more goals and assists in Europe’s top five leagues across the past
  five seasons. They begin the season at home to Newcastle, another team
  hamstrung by financial parameters, and have a seemingly kind start, facing
  only Eddie Howe’s side and Brentford from last season’s top 10 before the
  October international break. The warning sign is Villa flew out of the blocks
  last season – losing only one of their first 13 matches – but a hectic
  schedule punished them. The manager “I’m like a robot,” Emery said at the end
  of last season, describing his laser-focus at training. The 53-year-old is
  demanding of himself, staff and players, a football obsessive inspired by the
  methods of teams as grand as PSG and as modest as FC Andorra. It is not
  uncommon for him to study clips on the exercise bike or make notes on the
  rowing machine but his workaholic nature has led him to read books to control
  his emotions. Emery is the majority shareholder of fourth-tier Real Unión, the
  Basque club for whom his father, Juan, and grandfather, Antonio, played. His
  pièce de résistance remains his success in the Europa League – he has won it
  on four occasions – and this season he has the chance to make it five.
  Off-field picture Perhaps the most important piece of business was the move to
  sell the women’s team to help comply with the league’s profitability and
  sustainability regulations. The sale of a key player such as Martínez would
  liberate them in the market but Villa are under no pressure to sell prized
  assets. This summer Francesco Calvo, previously of Juventus, replaced Chris
  Heck as the president of business operations, with Calvo’s long-term aim to
  “make the club successful 360 degrees”. That helps explain the increase in
  season-ticket prices, the North Stand redevelopment which will take Villa
  Park’s capacity north of 50,000, the chain of concerts, including Black
  Sabbath last month, and news that the stadium will host Premiership rugby next
  March. Star signing It has been a slow summer and while Boubacar Kamara was on
  board last season, news the France midfielder penned a new five-year contract
  was understandably greeted by supporters, well, just like a new signing. The
  25-year-old, persuaded to join Villa in 2022 by the then manager, Steven
  Gerrard, after leaving his hometown club Marseille on a free, is one of
  Emery’s key cogs. He missed the start of last season with an anterior cruciate
  ligament injury but is ready to hit the ground running this time. Emery views
  Kamara as indispensable and him staying put is a huge boost. Stepping up It
  will be interesting to see if Zépiqueno Redmond, the forward whose name is
  supposedly inspired by a gangster in the Brazilian film City of God, can make
  a mark. The 19-year-old started for Feyenoord at the San Siro in February, en
  route to the Champions League last 16, but departed the Eredivisie club as a
  free agent, presenting Villa with an opportunity they felt was too good to
  pass up. Redmond scored twice against England at the European Under-19
  Championship and while he missed the pre-season trip to the US through injury,
  he could prove a wildcard with Emery thin on strikers. The 18-year-old
  midfielder Jamaldeen Jimoh-Aloba – part of the FA Youth Cup-winning team last
  season – did go on the pre-season tour. A big season for ... The end of last
  season was rather strange for Donyell Malen. Villa finally got their man when
  the flying Dutchman, on the books of Arsenal as a youngster, landed from
  Borussia Dortmund in January. Villa tried and failed to sign him the previous
  season but the carrot of the Champions League convinced him of the £20m move,
  having been defeated in the competition’s showpiece six months earlier. Malen
  arrived but, 12 days later, with Uefa’s registration deadline looming, Marcus
  Rashford and Marco Asensio were preferred to him and he was left out of
  Villa’s European squad. Malen scored in three successive Premier League wins
  in April but was limited to two top-flight starts, both before that
  goalscoring run. Surely more opportunities await.
