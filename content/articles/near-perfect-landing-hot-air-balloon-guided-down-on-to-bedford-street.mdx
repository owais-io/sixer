  A hot air balloon made a dramatic landing in the middle of a street in Bedford
  on Saturday in front of shocked residents. Sam Coldham said he saw the balloon
  descending in Bower Street in the east of England town at about 9.30am, while
  he was out walking the dog with his partner, Sian King. Footage taken by King
  shows the balloon trying to land in a residential street between parked cars,
  telegraph poles and wires. In the video, several bystanders can be seen
  rushing to help. They grab on to the guide rope to help lower the balloon to a
  safe spot, helping it to avoid crashing into houses or parked cars. Georgia
  Balać, whose partner assisted with the landing using an emergency line thrown
  down by the pilot, told the Bedford Independent: “It was extraordinary. It
  came down quickly and uncontrollably, very nearly missing the terraced houses
  and pylons. “It made a near-perfect landing between parked cars on either
  side.” The British Balloon and Airship Club confirmed to the BBC it “landed
  without incident” and everyone was OK. Only 98 incidents involving hot air
  balloons occurred in the UK between 1976 and 2004, according to a report by
  ScienceDirect. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is the independent aviation
  regulator in the UK. All ballooning operations must comply with strict CAA
  regulations to ensure optimal safety for passengers and crew members. One of
  the main requirements for commercial balloonists is a commercial balloon pilot
  licence. In April, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was
  investigating after receiving a report about a collision in Essex caused by a
  malfunction with a hot air balloon’s aircraft’s envelope – the large,
  airtight, balloon-shaped bag where the hot air goes.
