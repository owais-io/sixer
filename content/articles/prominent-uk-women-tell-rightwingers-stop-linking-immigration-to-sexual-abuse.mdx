  Prominent women including cultural figures, politicians and campaigners have
  signed a letter criticising rightwing attempts to link sexual violence in
  Britain to asylum seekers. Signatories include the musicians Paloma Faith,
  Charlotte Church and Anoushka Shankar as well as Labour, Green and independent
  MPs including Kim Johnson, Ellie Chowns, Diane Abbott and Zarah Sultana. “We
  reject the far right’s racist lies about ‘protecting’ women and girls. They
  are not defenders of women – they exploit violence against women to fuel hate
  and division,” the letter says. The open letter, titled Women Against the Far
  Right, follows a surge in protests outside accommodation housing asylum
  seekers and far-right attempts to exploit a number of cases of alleged sexual
  crimes involving asylum seekers. Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has
  sought to link government immigration policies to a rise in sexual offences.
  Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who joined protesters outside
  asylum accommodation in Epping, Essex, said last month that asylum seekers
  with “medieval attitudes” coming to Britain meant he was afraid for the safety
  of his three young daughters. The letter, which has been coordinated by Stand
  up to Racism, adds: “Violence against women and girls is a serious and urgent
  issue. But it will never be solved by the likes of Nigel Farage and Robert
  Jenrick targeting refugees, Muslims and migrants. “There is no evidence that
  people seeking refuge are more likely to commit acts of sexual violence. Many
  are themselves survivors of violence, war, and persecution. Blaming them
  distracts from tackling the deep-rooted causes of abuse and from holding those
  truly responsible to account.” The letter accuses the far right of seizing on
  lies and spreading misinformation to mobilise protests outside hotels housing
  refugees – including women and children – in a move which, the letter says,
  does nothing to make women safer. It references a Guardian report that found
  two in five of those arrested in last year’s far-right riots had been reported
  to the police for domestic abuse. “The truth is that sexual violence is
  endemic across society and far too often ignored by those in power,” the
  letter adds. “Public services for women, children, victims and survivors have
  been cut to the bone, and too many cases are left without justice.”
  Signatories to the letter also include the Labour MPs Nadia Whittome, Bell
  Ribeiro-Addy and Mary Kelly Foy, the Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti, and the
  general secretaries of unions including the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers
  Union, the Public and Commercial Services Union and the Transport Salaried
  Staffs’ Association. Others include Sarah Kilpatrick, president of the
  National Education Union, the broadcaster and DJ Annie Macmanus and groups
  including Abortion Rights UK. The signatories say they are backing a gathering
  later this month to oppose a major demonstration being organised in London by
  the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson. The protests outside hotels
  and accommodation housing asylum seekers have been accompanied by online
  claims aimed at creating a narrative that the residents present a threat to
  women in girls. Local people have often been centrally involved in the
  protests, which have included so-called pink protests with women and young
  girls at the forefront, but far-right activists have also been prominent. A
  number of protests have followed cases such as that of an asylum seeker in
  Epping who is accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. The case of
  Hadush Kebatu, from Ethiopia, who denies the charges against him, has been
  adjourned until 4 September. Claims such as one by Jenrick that 40% of sexual
  crimes in London last year were committed by foreign nationals appear to have
  been based on muddled statistics. Claims by Farage linking sexual offences and
  immigration are also strongly disputed, while the police have hit back at
  Reform UK’s allegation of a “cover-up” over the immigration status of two
  Afghan men being prosecuted in connection with the alleged rape of a
  12-year-old girl. Migrant charities and MPs this year accused the government
  of pandering to racism and stoking the possibility of riots after the Home
  Office said it would publish the nationalities of foreign criminals in the UK
  for the first time. Home Office sources have said the government wanted the
  public to be “better informed” about foreign criminals, including where they
  came from.
