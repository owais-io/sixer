  When Sammy Virji was DJing in room three of a local nightclub in Newcastle
  with his uni mates, he didn’t anticipate that the bouncy, bombastic bassline
  and UK garage sounds he was obsessed with would become so big across the pond.
  In June, he shut down New York’s Times Square with a set to announce his new
  album, Same Day Cleaning, followed by headlining his first North American
  stadium show. “It didn’t feel real, I was freaking out,” says Virji, still in
  disbelief. Also real: the tens of thousands singing along as he spliced the
  dreamy intro of Radiohead’s Everything in Its Right Place with his 2023 track
  If U Need It at this year’s Coachella. The 28-year-old from the market town of
  Witney, Oxfordshire, made his debut on the California festival’s
  second-largest stage in April. It was “the most nervous I’ve ever been,” says
  Virji, on a phone call from LA ahead of another festival set, “but I converted
  that into excitement and I was able to enjoy myself.” This bashful bass star
  has the demeanour of a nice young chap who is just genuinely gassed to be up
  there, giving massive grins and thumbs ups during his sets as if he almost
  can’t believe his luck. “I often don’t say what my aspirations are out loud
  because then it treats [music] like a business,” he says. “I’ve gone past what
  I always wanted to achieve – the most unachievable thing to me was doing a
  tune with [bassline star] Flava D. And then the next most unbelievable thing
  would be getting in the studio with Skrillex, and then that happened. The
  whole thing’s very surreal.” In the past two years, he’s become dance music’s
  next golden boy off the back of a viral set at DJ Mag’s HQ, setting off the
  office fire alarm with a selection that called back to the 2010s heyday of UK
  bass. But beyond the meme-able catchphrases (“it’s Virji, isn’t it”) and
  technical mastery, he’s most renowned for his well-crafted arsenal of
  self-made bangers. “Sammy’s tracks are an amazing hybrid of massively
  heavy-sounding but also catchy, joyous and fun to dance to,” says Dan Snaith,
  AKA Caribou/Daphni, who often deploys Virji’s big-hitters in his DJ sets, as
  do fellow dance A-listers Four Tet and Fred Again. “He has a kind of alchemy
  that makes his tracks bigger and bolder than anyone else’s.” Virji casts
  himself as “definitely a producer before I’m a DJ”, spot-welding the swinging
  drums and chopped-up vocal samples found in the UK garage of the mid-90s
  onwards to the four-to-the-floor rhythm of its bassline sub-genre, which
  originated in West Yorkshire and the Midlands. Add in the melodiousness of
  house music, the cheeky womps of dubstep, the gruff superstyling of a
  soundsystem MC, elements of grime and speed it all up: you’ve got a formula
  for bridging the UK club underground with American EDM. Virji has spent years
  perfecting his sound. Early on, Virji’s father Fayyaz – a trombonist who
  played on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill – introduced his son to production
  software Logic and Virji started off making “bad dubstep”, an attempt to
  emulate the classic Rinse compilations he discovered in primary school. By his
  teenage years, he had gravitated towards bassline, in thrall to Flava D, DJ Q
  and Dr Cryptic. With his 2020 debut album, Spice Up My Life, Virji cemented
  his transition to garage, and he’s released an impressive number of tracks
  since, such as 2023 masterpiece Shella Verse. There’s a certain irony to his
  music finding an audience in the US when the original UKG never did. “There
  seems to be a huge crowd ready to experience UK garage and bassline for the
  first time,” says Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet. “[It’s] the perfect next thing
  for the tech house and EDM fans.” Virji politely wonders whether it’s because
  his sound offers “a breath of fresh air” at festivals full of house and EDM,
  but it could also be the brightly lit positivity of his productions. “Optimism
  is very important, especially now,” Virji says. Hebden sees Virji’s real
  strength as “his musicality, taste and production skills – it’s not like he
  just picked the right genre and won. The clever stuff is in the sonics,
  melodies, dynamics, arrangements. He could be doing techno, jungle [or]
  psytrance and it would probably still be good. It’s exciting to have another
  UK producer cut through everything and make it all feel alive.” On Same Day
  Cleaning, Virji collaborates with UK rap royalty Giggs and Skepta, and Virji
  was fascinated by the latter MC’s creative process for their track Cops and
  Robbers. “He created the mood, put a UKG documentary on mute,” says Virji. “We
  must have sat there for half an hour with the beat on repeat, no one saying
  anything, until he goes, ‘OK, I’m ready to record.’ He hadn’t written anything
  down, he had it all in his head.” Virji also links up with UK garage pioneers
  of old, namely MJ Cole and returning duo Tuff Jam. “So many people don’t know
  how important these legends are,” says Virji. “As much as my role is about
  having fun and making people dance, it’s pointless doing it unless you’re
  helping to give them some history.” But while he recently released a
  90s-trance-laced summer smash called Nostalgia, Virji would rather focus on
  what’s new. “There’s so many things that get recycled, everything’s trying to
  sound old,” he notes. “But if you can make something original that’s going to
  be used in the future, that’s pretty cool.” • Same Day Cleaning is released
  via Capitol on 19 September
