  A reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England should rank as a joyful
  summer gift to borrowers weighed down by the high cost of mortgages and loans.
  Yet the latest quarter-point cut to the cost of borrowing, from 4.25% to 4%,
  is laced with so many warnings that any celebration will be muted. Most
  prominently, the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said in its latest
  assessment of the UK’s economic outlook that inflation is on course to peak at
  a higher rate in the second half of this year than previously forecast. Price
  spikes in food and energy and the higher cost of business services would push
  the consumer prices index to 4% in September, it said, before falling only
  slowly to an average of 3% in a year’s time. The MPC made clear that workers
  who sought to outrun this inflationary surge with higher wage claims would be
  likely to persuade the committee to bring its policy of slow and steady credit
  loosening to a grinding halt. This concern about wage rises, especially in the
  services industry, and a rise in food inflation to 5.5% later this year, is
  why financial markets judged that interest rates would fall more gradually
  over the next year than they expected this week. The committee’s judgment on
  this occasion was more about the number of redundancies, which are growing,
  and unemployment, which is rising at a time when business and consumer
  confidence remains subdued. Yet even this trend was qualified by a concern
  that while wage settlements have fallen towards the Bank’s equilibrium target
  of 3.25%, at 3.75% they remained too high. A reversal of the downward trend
  would be likely to persuade the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, to join those
  who want to freeze rates. Bailey voted with three other MPC members to cut
  interest rates by 0.25 percentage points against four members of the committee
  who said the Bank should pause until there was more clarity about the path of
  wages and inflation. A vote by the external member, Alan Taylor, for a
  half-point cut completed the voting. To break the deadlock, Bailey called for
  a second vote and Taylor relented, reluctantly, we assume, lending his vote
  for a more modest quarter-point reduction. The split on the MPC illustrates
  the dilemma facing all policymakers as the UK economy staggers through 2025.
  Rachel Reeves will be cheered that the Bank stuck to a forecast of a rise in
  economic growth in the last quarter of the year to 0.3% when other forecasters
  – notably the National Institute of Economic and Social Research – believe
  that Threadneedle Street’s prediction of 0.1% in the third quarter will be
  repeated in the fourth. All positive figures are music to Treasury ears,
  however modest, but the chancellor knows the Bank’s forecasts present her with
  big challenges. In addition to the pain that fewer jobs and higher prices will
  inflict on household incomes, she will be concerned that conceding
  inflation-busting wage rises across the public sector will make life harder
  for the MPC to make further interest rate cuts. Public sector unions are
  queueing up to demand better living standards, and the impact is double-edged.
  Not only will it put pressure on the Bank to abandon further cuts, the extra
  costs to the exchequer will also be intense when there are already plenty of
  predictions of a deficit in the autumn budget. Another big bill for the
  Treasury, and one it will not be able to resist, is a rise in the state
  pension. Unlike the UK’s 31 million workers, 12 million pensioners have a
  triple lock guarantee that means their annual incomes rise in line with
  average earnings, inflation or a minimum of 2.5%. The increase is tied to the
  September inflation number. If it hits 4%, as expected by the Bank, pensioners
  will be in the top rank of earners when the rise is applied next April.
