  Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle and do
  not intend to submit a second offer for the striker in this transfer window.
  Despite long-held interest in the Sweden international and his desire to move
  to Merseyside, Liverpool’s first formal offer came in under the £120m
  suggested when Richard Hughes, sporting director at Anfield, made an informal
  enquiry over Isak’s availability a fortnight ago. Newcastle value their prized
  asset at £150m, a British transfer-record sum, but are reluctant to sell the
  25-year-old, who was the second highest goalscorer in the Premier League last
  season behind Mohamed Salah. Given how swiftly Newcastle rejected their offer,
  Liverpool consider it futile to return with a second bid before the transfer
  window closes on 1 September. Their offer of £110m for the want-away player
  remains on the table. Liverpool were encouraged to step up their pursuit by
  Isak’s stance following Hughes’ enquiry and the player’s representatives. The
  club have spent almost £300m so far this summer, including a £79m deal to sign
  Newcastle target Hugo Ekitiké. But with £190m recouped in sales since Hughes
  arrived in June 2024, plus healthy revenues from their title triumph and
  return to the Champions League, Liverpool are in a position to test
  Newcastle’s resolve to keep Isak. Their current transfer record is the £100m
  paid to Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz in June. That could rise to a
  British transfer record of £116m with add-ons. Isak did not travel on
  Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia. The club attributed his absence to a
  minor thigh injury but the player informed them that he wishes to explore his
  options this summer, with Liverpool his preferred destination, and has been
  training at former club Real Sociedad this week. It is unclear whether Isak
  had Newcastle’s permission to do so. There has also been no progress on a new
  and improved contract. Isak, signed from Sociedad for around £60m in 2022, has
  three years remaining on his contract at St James’ Park. Newcastle have
  maintained that the forward is not for sale but have been attempting to sign
  other top-level strikers this summer, so far without success. Whether a
  breakthrough in Newcastle’s striker search softens their stance on Isak
  remains to be seen. Eddie Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing
  the club’s recruitment this summer after Paul Mitchell stepped down as
  sporting director and with chief executive Darren Eales due to leave on health
  grounds. As well as Ekitiké, Newcastle have missed out on strikers Liam Delap,
  João Pedro and Bryan Mbeumo, along with goalkeeper James Trafford, who
  rejoined Manchester City. RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is a target but
  Newcastle face competition from Manchester United for the 6ft 5in Slovenian,
  while Brentford have rejected their opening offer for Yoane Wissa.
