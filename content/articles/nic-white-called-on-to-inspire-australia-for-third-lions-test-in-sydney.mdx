  The Wallabies will take inspiration from retiring scrum-half Nic White as they
  seek to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test against the British &amp;
  Irish Lions in Sydney on Saturday. The veteran announced on Thursday he would
  retire from international rugby after Saturday’s Test and coach Joe Schmidt
  has handed him the No 9 jersey for his 73rd Wallabies cap in a nod to his long
  contribution to Australian rugby. White said it was the right time to “pass on
  the baton” to players like Jake Gordon and Tate McDermott, who have played
  ahead of him in the first two Tests. “Pulling on the gold jersey was a dream
  of mine when I was a young boy in Scone and to say I’ve done it 72 times, with
  one last crack on Saturday night, is something I’m incredibly proud of and a
  privilege I’ve never taken for granted,” White said. “Rugby has given me so
  much to be grateful for. I’ve made some incredible memories, some lifelong
  friendships and had the opportunity to see the world.” Schmidt described White
  as “the ultimate competitor”. “First and foremost Nic is a great man to have
  in a squad,” he said. “He’s team first all the time and has been at the top of
  the game for over a decade.” Outside White, Tom Lynagh at flyhalf and the
  centre pairing of Len Ikitau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii keep their places,
  while Dylan Pietsch will replace the injured Harry Potter on the wing. There
  are more changes in the forwards, as tighthead prop Taniela Tupou replaces
  Allan Alaalatoa who is out with a shoulder complaint. Rob Valetini will miss
  the game as the staff manage his return from a calf injury, after he lasted
  only 40 minutes in Melbourne. Into the loose forwards comes Tom Hooper to play
  alongside Queensland pair Fraser McReight and Harry Wilson who was again named
  captain, and prop Zane Noongar has been brought on to the bench. Carlo Tizzano
  and Tom Robertson have dropped off the bench, which has a five-three split
  including the recalled Andrew Kellaway. Schmidt said the squad has been
  “deflated” after the “gut-wrenching” end to the Test in Melbourne, when a
  contentious last-minute try won the Lions the match and the series, but they
  have now put that experience behind them. “They have started to gather
  momentum in the back half of the week and will be ready to go again on
  Saturday,” he said. “The support in Brisbane and Melbourne helped to lift the
  squad, and I know the support this weekend in Accor Stadium, will again help
  to lift the players in the high-pressure moments that we know are coming.” The
  83,000-capacity stadium is sold out for the clash, as the Wallabies hope to
  avoid their first whitewash against the Lions since 1904. Wallabies: 15-Tom
  Wright, 14-Max Jorgensen, 13-Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, 12-Len Ikitau, 11-Dylan
  Pietsch, 10-Tom Lynagh, 9-Nic White, 8-Harry Wilson, 7-Fraser McReight, 6-Tom
