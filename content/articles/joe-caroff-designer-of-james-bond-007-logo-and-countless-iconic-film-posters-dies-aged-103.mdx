  The graphic designer responsible for the 007 gun logo as well as countless
  classic film posters has died, aged 103. Joe Caroff, whose work can be seen on
  the posters for films including West Side Story, A Hard Day’s Night, Last
  Tango in Paris, Cabaret, Manhattan and The Last Temptation of Christ, died on
  Sunday. His sons, Peter and Michael Caroff, told the New York Times he been
  under hospice care at his home in Manhattan, one day short of his 104th
  birthday. Caroff worked on more than 300 campaigns during his career, but his
  first two commissions turned out to be among his most enduring – and
  lucrative. First, United Artists executive David Chasman hired him to design
  the poster for West Side Story (1961). The better to suggest rough brickwork,
  Caroff scuffed the lettering, then added fire escapes and perching balletic
  dancers. Adapting the font to suit the material became a trademark. Other key
  examples include his poster for Manhattan (1979), one of more than a dozen
  collaborations with Woody Allen. In that image, Caroff assembled silhouettes
  of recognisable New York skyscrapers, including the Empire State Building,
  Chrysler building and the twin towers to spell out the word “Manhattan”. The
  second task assigned to Caroff by Chasman was to design a letterhead for the
  publicity release for the first Bond film, Dr No, in 1962. “He said, ‘I need a
  little decorative thing on top,’” Caroff recalled in 2021. “I knew [Bond’s]
  designation was 007, and when I wrote the stem of the seven, I thought, ‘That
  looks like the handle of a gun to me.’ It was very spontaneous, no effort, it
  was an instant piece of creativity.” Taking inspiration from Ian Fleming’s
  favourite gun, a Walther PPK, Caroff extended the image with a barrel and
  trigger and was paid $300 – a fee never increased by any residuals or
  royalties. As with much of his work, the logo was also uncredited, and Caroff
  never received the public acclaim or name recognition of his close
  contemporary, Saul Bass. Other key posters included Sergio Leone’s A Fistful
  of Dollars (1964) and For a Few Dollars More (1965), as well as Last Tango in
  Paris (1972), Rollerball (1975), An Unmarried Woman (1978) and Gandhi (1982).
  As well as working on graphics and posters, Caroff created a number of opening
  title sequences, including those for Richard Attenborough’s A Bridge Too Far
  (1977), Volker Schlöndorff’s Death of a Salesman (1985), and Martin Scorsese’s
  The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). He sought above all else “effervescence”
  in his work, he said in the 2022 TCM documentary By Design: The Joe Caroff
  Story. “I want it to have a life, it doesn’t want to lie there flat.”
