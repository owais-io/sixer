  Companies are making thousands of pounds by misleading parents with claims
  that collecting stem cells from their children’s teeth can be a treatment for
  diabetes and autism, an investigation has found. Tooth stem cell banking, also
  known as dental pulp cell banking, involves parents collecting and sending
  lost milk teeth to a laboratory where stem cells are harvested from the dental
  pulp. Firms that advertise tooth banking services claim these stem cells can
  be used in treatments for conditions such as diabetes as well as for autism.
  The investigation, by Emma Wilkinson and published in the BMJ, found that
  three companies in the UK offer tooth stem cell banking – BioEden, Future
  Health Biobank and Stem Protect. The service costs about £1,900, with a £95
  annual storage fee. On its website, Future Health Biobank says it has released
  26 tooth stem cell samples for treatment, including for autism, type 1
  diabetes and knee cartilage regeneration. Stem Protect states on its website
  that tooth stem cells can be used for cleft palate repair and HIV/Aids among
  other conditions, and says “medical trials into autism and cerebral palsy
  involve the pulp found inside teeth and offer hope for hundreds of
  conditions”. BioEden’s website claimed stem cell therapy had been described as
  the “next frontier” for treating both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and that the
  company had “already witnessed the remarkable evidence of these ongoing
  developments” among its customers. However, experts have expressed doubts
  about the medical value of tooth stem cell banking. “There is a lack of
  evidence and a paucity of research using dental pulp stem cells to treat
  patients,” said Jill Shepherd, a senior lecturer in stem cell biology at the
  University of Kent. “There’s no evidence to suggest stem cells stored from a
  child’s milk tooth would ever be needed to treat that child.” Sufyan Hussain,
  an investigator on the UK arm of a global clinical trial evaluating stem cell
  therapy, said there was not a definitive answer regarding the “optimal source
  of stem cells for future diabetes therapies”. “This highlights how emotive
  this matter can be, as parents naturally want the best possible outcomes for
  their children,” Hussain said. “While we remain hopeful about future
  treatments, there is also a risk that companies might exploit these hopes to
  generate additional revenue.” Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy,
  research and strategy at the National Autistic Society in the UK, said it was
  “outrageous” that tooth stem cell procedures are being advertised to parents
  with the claim of “treating” autism. He added: “Autism is not a disease or
  illness; it cannot be treated and there is no cure. It is dangerous and
  morally bankrupt to target potentially vulnerable people with expensive
  procedures that could, in fact, cause harm.” In response to the BMJ article,
  Future Health Biobank said it was looking at how information on its site is
  presented in order to ensure “readers can clearly distinguish between client
  experiences and formally published clinical outcomes”. A spokesperson for Stem
  Protect said: “We have made no unfounded claims, and our website has been
  reviewed and approved by the Human Tissue Authority. We remain committed to
  ensuring stem cell banking is presented as a valuable resource, backed by
  evidence and transparency.”
