  A cow’s tooth from a jawbone deliberately placed beside the entrance to
  Stonehenge at the Neolithic monument’s very beginning in 2995 to 2900BC could
  offer tantalising new evidence about how the stones were transported about 125
  miles from Wales to Salisbury Plain. Analysis of the third molar tooth showed
  the animal began life in Wales, adding weight to a theory that cows were used
  as beasts of burden in hauling the enormous stones across the country. Since
  the jawbone was discovered a century ago historians have been intrigued about
  why it was placed there and where it had come from. Researchers from the
  British Geological Survey (BGS), Cardiff University and University College
  London found lead isotopes revealed composition spikes during the late winter
  to spring, pointing to a source that was older than the metal in the rest of
  the tooth. This was due to the cow, during pregnancy, drawing on lead already
  in its skeleton to create the calf, it is thought. That lead suggested the cow
  originated from an area with Palaeozoic rocks, such as the bluestones found in
  Wales, before moving to Stonehenge. “It tells us that very early in its life
  it incorporated lead into its skeleton and that lead was from old Palaeozoic
  rocks, older than about 400m years old. Those types of rocks crop up primarily
  in Britain in Wales, which is the nearest supply, and also in the Lake
  District and Scotland,” said Prof Jane Evans, a BGS honorary research
  associate. “Wales is the closest area from which you get those kind of lead
  compositions. That suggests this animal, found in Wiltshire, didn’t start life
  in that kind of area. It must have been grazing at some time on older rocks,
  and the obvious conclusion, given it’s Stonehenge, is that Wales is the
  probable origin of the cow’s early life.” She added: “The jawbone was placed
  in a very specific part of the earliest ring structure of Stonehenge, which
  implies it was some kind of ritual, archeologists will say. So the question
  is, why? And then you come to the question: has this animal come with the
  people who were involved in the transportation of the stones, or at least the
  earliest migrations of the people bringing the stones, from Wales to
  England?’” Until recently archeologists had found no evidence of cattle as
  beasts of burden in Neolithic times, but a more recent paper suggested the
  structure of some cattle’s feet indicated they could have been, said Evans.
  “It feeds into that narrative quite well.” Even if cows were not used,
  associated oxen may have been. “I don’t know how long it takes to drag stones
  from Wales to Stonehenge, but you need to be able to feed yourself and so it’s
  going to be a big process. You have got to have a huge support network to do
  it,” said Evans. Carbon isotopes showed the cow’s diet changed with the
  seasons: woodland fodder in winter and open pasture in summer. The strontium
  isotopes indicated the seasonal food sources came from different geological
  areas, suggesting the cow either moved seasonally or that winter fodder was
  imported. While the jaw was found buried at Stonehenge, what was unclear was
  whether the cow travelled to the site alive or whether its remains were
  curated there, but it was possible the animal held significance to the
  population during the earliest building of Stonehenge, said researchers.
  Michael Parker Pearson, a professor of British later prehistory at UCL, said
  it was “yet more fascinating evidence for Stonehenge’s link with south-west
  Wales” and raised “the tantalising possibility that cattle helped to haul the
  stones”. Richard Madgwick, a professor of archaeological science at Cardiff,
  said: “It provides unparalleled new detail on the distant origins of the
  animal and the arduous journey it was brought on. So often grand narratives
  dominate research on major archaeological sites, but this detailed
  biographical approach on a single animal provides a brand-new facet to the
  story of Stonehenge.” While archaeologists have long known some of the stones
  came from the Preseli Hills in Wales, and others were from Wiltshire, one
  central megalith was recently identified as from north-east Scotland.
