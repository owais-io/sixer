  It is unlikely that Vladimir Putin will arrive in Alaska on Friday to present
  Donald Trump with a territorial demand for the 49th state, sold by Tsar
  Alexander II to the US for $7.2m (£5.4m) in 1867. The Russian president, after
  all, has another land deal on his mind – to persuade Trump of the merits of
  swapping parts of Ukrainian territory in return for him perhaps agreeing to
  the ceasefire the US president so desperately wants, but does not know how to
  get. Putin’s influential foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Alaska
  was an “entirely logical” location for the summit, as if the hop across the
  Bering Strait that divides the countries is a simple trip. The gap between the
  US and Russian mainlands may be 55 miles, but it is roughly a nine-hour flight
  from Moscow to Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city. Even for Trump, travelling
  from Washington DC on Air Force One, it will be not much less than eight
  hours. Alaska is a location of mutual inconvenience, which indicates that
  other factors are at play. The remote state is a long way from Ukraine and its
  European allies, and risks pushing both into the distant background. Though
  Trump seems open, in theory, to letting Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, attend, it is hard to imagine Putin being so welcoming. His prize,
  after all, are private talks with the occupant of the White House about
  sanctions, trade, the reach of Nato in Europe – negotiating tracks far beyond
  his latest proposals for dominating Ukraine. Above all, Alaska is a safe place
  for the Russian leader to visit. Putin is still wanted by the international
  criminal court, accused of war crimes in relation to the forced deportation of
  children from Ukraine to Russia in March 2023. There is an arrest warrant out,
  but neither Russia nor crucially the US recognise the court. Nor are there any
  unfriendly countries to overfly. A trip around the top of the globe is
  unlikely to run into unexpected difficulties that might make travelling over
  the Black Sea to Istanbul in Turkey unattractive. A casual recollection
  suggests US-Russia or, going back further, US-Soviet summits, have been held
  in cooler locations, loosely reflecting the two countries’ more northerly
  positions. Easily the most notable is Helsinki. It was in the Finnish capital
  in 2018, the last time Trump and Putin met while in office, that the US leader
  declared that he trusted Putin more than his own intelligence agencies when it
  came to allegations of interference in the 2016 US election. Those with cold
  war memories will recall the Reykjavik summit of 1986, where Ronald Reagan and
  Mikhail Gorbachev discussed eliminating nuclear weapons, but couldn’t quite
  agree. Gorbachev wanted Reagan to give up testing on the star wars missile
  defence initiative, but the then US president would not agree to do so and the
  summit broke up in failure. But in the 1990s when summit meetings between the
  two countries were more frequent, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin even met in
  Birmingham and Shropshire in 1998, a time when Russia had just joined what
  then became the G8. Today, however, nuclear disarmament and G8 cooperation are
  quaint messages from a different era – one in which the group is again the G7.
  The Alaska meeting is only the fourth US-Russia summit since 2010 and, while
  it remains possible that the discussions will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine,
  there are few grounds for optimism when the war continues to be fought so
  bitterly on the frontlines and in the rear, with Russia repeatedly bombing
  Ukrainian cities, trying to force its democratic neighbour into submission. •
  This article was amended on 11 August 2025. An earlier version said that
  Anchorage was the state capital of Alaska. In fact, that is Juneau.
