  Eve Johnson Houghton has saddled three Royal Ascot winners, including a Group
  One, in the past eight years, having bought all three for a combined total of
  just under £30,000, and as she set out on the business of buying next year’s
  two-year-olds at the Doncaster sales on Wednesday, the trainer made the
  process of equine bargain-hunting sound simple enough. “I just like a nice
  horse,” Johnson Houghton said. “You’re looking for different things for
  different clients, but they’ve got to walk well and have a good outlook, and I
  have to forgive a few things as well, because they can’t be perfect specimens
  at my price. “Sometimes it’s the stallion that people are cold on, or it’s not
  entirely correct [physically], but they’ve got to have a good outlook and a
  good eye, I think.” If it were that straightforward, though, everyone would be
  doing it, and the truth is that few, if any, British trainers have played the
  lower end of the market with as much success as Johnson Houghton in recent
  years. Johnson Houghton is a third-generation trainer at Woodway Stables,
  which was purchased by her grandmother, Helen, in 1945, whose many successes
  from the yard, including a 2,000 Guineas victory with Gilles de Retz in 1956,
  went unrecorded – in the form-book sense at least – as women were not allowed
  to hold a trainer’s licence until the mid-1960s. It was not until December
  1977 that Johnson Houghton’s achievements were finally recognised, when she
  became one of the first three women elected to membership of the Jockey Club
  that had refused her a licence two decades earlier. Her father, Fulke Johnson
  Houghton, then held the licence at the family stable from 1961 until 2007,
  saddling more than 1,200 winners including Ile De Bourbon in the King George
  VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1978. He remained a key presence in the
  stable until his death in February this year, and Johnson Houghton says that
  she is “still really lucky to have Dad as my backup. I’ve really, really
  missed him this year, but it was a great grounding and I’ve still got my mum
  around, which is fabulous. Trainers are the ones with our names in lights but
  no trainer is capable without their team, and I’ve got a brilliant yard team
  as well. “We’re a wonderfully old-fashioned yard, I try to make small
  improvements every year, but I took over an amazing place and you can’t get
  away from the basics. I’m lucky enough to train for some wonderful people as
  well, and they trust me to do the best with them.” Accidental Agent, a
  home-bred who was unwanted at the sales and bought back for 8,000 gns
  (£8,400), won the Group One Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2018.
  Chipotle, a 10,000 gns (£10,500) yearling, took the Windsor Castle Stakes at
  the Royal meeting three years later, while this summer has been a triumph for
  the trainer’s eye for a bargain, with Havana Hurricane, at 9,000 gns (£9,450)
  taking the Windsor Castle and the unbeaten Zavateri, still a relatively cheap
  buy at 35,000 gns (£36,750), proving to be one of 2025’s best juveniles. Two
  Group Two victories – in the July Stakes at Newmarket and the Vintage Stakes
  at Goodwood – mean that he has already repaid his purchase price more than
  four times over. As a result, Johnson Houghton is on course to reach £1m in
  prize money in Britain in a season for the first time since she took over the
  licence at the magnificent 200-acre Woodway Stables, near Blewbury in
  Oxfordshire, in 2007. There are extra orders, too, to be filled at the
  yearling sales over the next couple of months, though not necessarily any
  increase in her individual budgets. Everyone loves a bargain, after all. “I
  have, definitely [got more orders], but all to a level,” she says. “Which is
  great, don’t get me wrong, but it would be nice to get a few more … grown-up
  orders, shall we say? As I keep trying to tell everyone, it’s amazing if you
  can actually win a Royal Ascot race for 10 grand. It’s possible, but it’s
  bloody hard, and you’ve got to be at it a long time to do that. The owner of
  Havana Hurricane had some disasters with me before that, and he stuck at it
  and in the end, we got it right.” Another essential talent when buying
  racehorses at auction is knowing when to let go. “You set your price and
  sometimes you might say, I’ll give it another kick, but other times, you just
  walk away,” she says. “You have to, you can’t overspend and just because you
  pay more, it doesn’t necessarily mean you get any better. You just don’t have
  to forgive so much.” And though sticking to a budget might seem to rule out
  the need to consider every yearling at an auction like Doncaster, where around
  400 horses will go under the hammer in two days and the top prices are into
  six figures, the opposite is often the case. “I think you have to look at
  more,” Johnson Houghton says. “You have to look at everything in case
  something falls through the gaps. I won’t look at every horse here but Ant
  [the veteran bloodstock agent Anthony Bromley, the other half of her
  purchasing operation] will.” Zavateri will bid to give his trainer the second
  Group One win of her career in his next start in either the National Stakes,
  at the Curragh next month, or the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket in October.
  Havana Hurricane, meanwhile, is being aimed at the Group Two Flying Childers
  Stakes at Doncaster’s St Leger meeting in just over two weeks’ time. And all
  the while, their trainer will continue her meticulous search at the yearling
  sales, looking for a nice horse at the right price. “Bloody hard” it might be,
  but who would want to bet against Eve Johnson Houghton sifting another golden
  nugget from the auction ring before the year is out? Balding’s Blue Bolt can
  take flight The Solario Stakes is in the “feature” slot at Sandown on Saturday
  but the Group Three Atalanta Stakes at 2.25, with £85,000 in the prize fund,
  is the most valuable race on the card and has attracted a competitive
  14-strong field with a dozen runners priced up including Flight, the runner-up
  in the 1,000 Guineas in May, a hugely promising novice winner in Alobayyah and
  Andrew Balding’s progressive Blue Bolt. Flight won her maiden at Sandown last
  summer but needs to bounce back from a couple of sub-par runs in Group One
  company at the Curragh and Royal Ascot, and though William Haggas, Alobayyah’s
  trainer, is more than capable of getting one ready first time up, the strong
  recent form of Blue Bolt (2.25) is more persuasive. Andrew Balding’s filly has
  won her last three starts with plenty to spare, including a Listed event over
  Saturday’s track and trip last time out and looks more than ready for this
  step up in grade. Beverley 1.30 A beaten odds-on favourite on his two previous
  starts, Crown Of Oaks finally got off the mark at Ayr last time and has scope
  for further progress now he is up and running. Sandown 1.50 William Buick is
  an eye-catching booking for Mick Appleby’s Kodi Lion, who looked an unlucky
  loser at Haydock last time. Beverley 2.05 Royal Ascot winner Adrestia has the
  plum draw, remains progressive and offers some value against the likely
  favourite, Regional. Chester 2.40 Tabletalk has been running above this grade
  so far this season and has a couple of pounds at least in hand of his rivals
  here. Sandown 3.00 The form of the London Gold Cup at Newbury in May looks
  typically strong, with four subsequent winners from the nine runners so far,
  and the winner, Saddadd, should be a fifth as he makes his first start since
  off a 6lb higher mark. Chester 3.15 The drop back to seven furlongs looks the
  right move for Hawksbill, who was headstrong over a mile at Haydock last time
  but still just a nose behind the winner. Sandown 3.35 With likely favourite
  Publish an absentee, Charlie Appleby’s Pacific Avenue, a cosy winner on debut
  at Newmarket in June, can give the trainer a third Solario Stakes success in
  the last four seasons.
