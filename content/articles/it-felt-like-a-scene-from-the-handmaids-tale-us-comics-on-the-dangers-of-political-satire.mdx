  In April, comedian Jena Friedman had a strange encounter in the Vancouver
  airport. She had just performed a Ted talk about the future of comedy and was
  heading home to the US, when someone she thought worked for airport security
  quizzed her about her visit. Thinking he was probing for visa infringements,
  “I just said I was doing comedy. Then he asked: ‘What do you joke about?’
  Stupidly, I lightly flirted with him, and was like: ‘Everything other than
  airport security!’ He didn’t react at all. Then I realised he was US border
  control. He asked again: ‘What do you joke about?’” Friedman is a veteran of
  The Daily Show and The Late Show, and her standup comedy often features
  excoriating routines at the expense of the political establishment. “I just
  froze because I am a political comedian and I didn’t know what to say. Then he
  said: ‘Do you joke about politicians?’” She made it home, but the incident
  stuck with her. Friedman lives in LA, and the recent actions of the US
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement “detaining anyone and everyone who looks a
  certain way” put her on high alert. “It was such a quick, on its face benign,
  interaction,” she says. “But it did feel like a scene out of The Handmaid’s
  Tale. I’m a blonde, white woman who looks like a Republican’s wife and I have
  an American passport. But what if I had said ‘Yes?’ Don’t we want to live in a
  country where we can joke about politicians, where we can joke about
  anything?” Friedman incorporated that moment into her new standup show,
  Motherf*cker, which she’s performing at the Edinburgh fringe. The show is a
  change of pace. She’s generally resisted getting personal on stage, resenting
  the idea that women have to be relatable to succeed in comedy, but this time
  it felt unavoidable, as she explores the life-changing experience of becoming
  a parent while her own mother was dying. “It’s about grief, but it’s also
  political,” she says. “The vibe in certain circles does feel like we’re
  grieving. So there’s something about my show that’s connecting to the larger
  moment.” Friedman is among a crop of US comedians with roots in topical comedy
  appearing at this year’s fringe. Another stalwart of US political comedy,
  Michelle Wolf, is back, too, while standup and former Saturday Night Live
  writer Sam Jay is making her festival debut. Wolf earned her stripes on The
  Daily Show and Late Night with Seth Myers, and gained notoriety with her 2018
  set at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, in which she roasted Trump and
  his collaborators. These days, she lives in Barcelona, although returns to the
  US regularly for comedy work. She’s yet to encounter border trouble but, with
  reports of people with green cards and citizens being detained, she says: “I’m
  keeping an eye on it.” Comedians Rosie O’Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres have both
  said that the state of US politics has forced them out of the country –
  O’Donnell to Ireland and DeGeneres to England. O’Donnell has written a show on
  just that, which she performed for the first week of the fringe. Wolf is happy
  with her move to Barcelona, and feels her comedy has benefited from other
  cultural perspectives, but returns to the US because “the audiences are great”
  and there’s plenty of work. While other US comedians have also discussed the
  idea of moving to Europe, she thinks it won’t happen until there’s “an impetus
  to go, something I don’t think is far off, like: you can’t talk about this any
  more, you can’t talk about that any more”. Last month, satirist Stephen
  Colbert announced that network CBS had cancelled The Late Show after 33 years.
  Many thought the timing, three days on from Colbert criticising CBS parent
  company Paramount for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, was suspect.
  Fellow late-night talkshow host Jon Stewart criticised the move on his podcast
  and pointed to wider fear across the industry: “There are a lot of things that
  will never be made, that you will never know about, that will be killed in the
  bed before they ever had a chance because of this chilling effect.” Friedman’s
  glad to see Colbert and Stewart speaking out against Trump and his
  administration – and agrees there’s a “chill”. “The industry has already been
  less supportive of political comedy than they were under Biden and Obama.
  However, “seeing the most prominent comedians taking [Trump] to task, like
  Matt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] from South Park, Colbert and Stewart, that
  gives me hope”. Meanwhile, Michelle Wolf’s standup merges the personal and
  political and her podcast, Wolf’s Thought Box, tackles current affairs. Her
  new show, which she’s performing while eight months pregnant at the fringe,
  explores life and society “through the lens of being a mom now”. There are
  punchlines on societal pressures for working mothers, home birth,
  momfluencers, gender inequalities and more. “We’re in an era now where people
  are talking about motherhood realistically and that’s very refreshing,” she
  says. Still, political comedy isn’t absent. “I feel like I have to address the
  whole America and Trump thing … people expect me to say something about it.”
  She plans to tailor topical jokes to the day’s news but, “I don’t like making
  it a large part of my set, because it bores me. There’s always something crazy
  happening, but it’s hard to come up with creative angles other than: can you
  believe this?” It’s been nine years since she first started writing jokes
  about Trump and, in that time, her life has transformed – she met her partner,
  moved abroad, and is about to have her second child. Her main feeling now is:
  “How are we still talking about him? How are we still in the same spot?” Jay
  reflects that slow build in her show, We the People, in which she explores the
  state of America – looking back to the “unconfident whites” who founded the
  nation. She describes the show as “a fun, risky little ride” as she tries to
  get to the root of why the US feels so divided, and what we can do to better
  understand one another. “It’s this broader conversation I’ve been having about
  America and race,” Jay says. The whole world feels unsettled right now and
  there’s an inability to consider other perspectives, Jay says. “How did we get
  here as Americans? Of course, I think race plays a large part in it. And how
  did these race relations get to the way they are? Not just blaming white
  people, but exploring the type of white people we’re dealing with, why they
  might be the way they are, their roots in England.” Trump came up plenty
  during Jay’s time on SNL and appears in her fringe show as a “braggadocious”
  fool, unable to keep state secrets, yet smartly appealing to the frustrations
  of America’s poor white communities. But the conditions that created and
  elevated Trump are more interesting to Jay: “He’s the symptom of this, not the
  cause. This is a result of years and years of us doing it wrong … it’s been
  building for a long time and for a lot of different reasons.” Friedman agrees:
  “I started working at the Daily Show in 2012, I was at Letterman before that,
  so I started looking at politics on a daily basis since 2010, and this is a
  long time coming.” This also means that, among US audiences, not everyone
  wants political comedy. “They’re always looking for escapism. In the first
  term, there was definite Trump fatigue,” Friedman says. “As a political comic,
  I’ve always done better in the UK than the US. It’s the UK audiences who are
  like: what the hell’s going on over there?” says Friedman. The mood in US
  comedy is, Jay says, “the mood in America … chaos. There’s no way to keep up.
  People are also very desensitised. Shit just keeps happening in more extreme
  ways that people are losing a metric for it.” All three agree that comedy can
  help share differing worldviews. “Even if it’s people we disagree with, the
  sign of a healthy democracy is when people can safely be on stage saying
  whatever we want, ideally in good faith,” Friedman says. “I support all
  comedians, I support freedom of expression and I want to see more of it. I
  want to see people more open to people they disagree with. Whenever I do
  political comedy, the goal is not to preach to the choir, it’s to get people
  to see things slightly differently.” Jay has said that comedy can be a tool
  for empathy. “I look at it as a conversation. It can serve a purpose of actual
  understanding, understanding that we’re all humans trying to figure out a
  thing that doesn’t make a lot of sense – existing. Everybody is grappling with
  these things in their own way.” What does the future hold for US comedians?
  “It’s too soon to tell,” says Friedman. “But I think everybody exercising the
  US first amendment in a way that’s funny and disarming is really important
  right now.” Jay says: “Once I’m on stage, I’m gonna say what I’m gonna say. If
  I can’t come back as a result, I’ll just have to have my girlfriend come meet
  me in Scotland.” • Jena Friedman: Motherf*cker is at Hive 1 at Monkey Barrel
  Comedy until 24 August. Michelle Wolf is at various venues until 17 August.
  Sam Jay: We the People is at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 August
