  Nerds review – Steve Jobs and Bill Gates go toe-to-toe in a rollicking rap
  battle

  This musical comedy about billionaire tech gurus Steve Jobs (Kane Oliver
  Parry) and Bill Gates (Dan Buckley) is, in all likelihood, not going to
  enlighten you about the making of these Silicon Valley founders. A young Gates
  (of Microsoft) meets Jobs (of Apple and iPhones) at a Homebrew Computer Club
  competition in the 1970s. Jobs wins it and from hereon the rivalry is on – or
  that is how this production spins it. Capturing the vaguest approximation of
  the relationship between the men, there is little fidelity to fact, or nuance,
  or penetrating psychological unpicking. But it is a highly entertaining, well
  put together parody all the same, however cartoonish in its portrayal of the
  two central players. It takes swipes at technology (from old-school cameras to
  printers and the limited life of Apple products) and the nerdy megalomania of
  tech culture itself. Under the direction of Nick Winston, characters resemble
  the geeks from TV series The IT Crowd. To a lesser degree, it is about
  self-acceptance from those deemed oddballs by their school bullies, mainly
  through the character of Gates. Jobs is, by contrast, a visionary hippy and
  self-serving ladies’ man whose charisma Gates envies. Both are ridiculed and
  brilliantly performed. Writer-lyricists Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner
  give the show a high school style makeover while Hal Goldberg’s score brings
  easy, fun tunes. There are romances for the men in Sally (Elise Zavou), a
  Xerox researcher with a social conscience, and fellow nerd Myrtle (Teleri
  Hughes) for Gates. Their real-life love lives, and wives, are nowhere to be
  found. Real life is ignored or smoothed over on the whole: there is a legal
  battle, which follows some facts around Apple’s suing of Microsoft in 1988,
  and it ends in an out-of-court settlement, but without really telling us how
  or why. But it includes a thoroughly amusing rap battle between Gates and Jobs
  – a highlight of the show – which leads to the sudden transformation of Gates
  from an insecure tyrant into a fairy godfather of sorts. He steps away from
  Microsoft willingly here and devotes himself to his charitable foundation.
  Jobs’ death from cancer is ignored, too, although there is a – very funny –
  song in which he writes an email to God (with lots of ccs) because he thinks
  he is dying. While it fails in its factual history, this is a compelling
  parody of the tech age, then and now, with heaps of the fun factor. • At
  Cowbarn at Underbelly, Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our
  Edinburgh festival reviews
