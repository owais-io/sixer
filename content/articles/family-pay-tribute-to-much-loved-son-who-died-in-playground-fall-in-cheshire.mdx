  The family of a 12-year-old boy who died after falling in a park playground in
  Cheshire have said he “made every day worth living”. Logan Carter died on
  Friday 29 August after falling from apparatus at the Wharton recreation ground
  in Winsford, it was believed. Officers were called to the scene near Ledward
  Street at 6.11pm by the North West ambulance service and found the boy
  seriously injured. Logan was treated by paramedics but is understood to have
  died at the scene. A roundabout at the park was later taped off by police. In
  a statement released by Cheshire police, his family paid tribute to “a little
  boy who was so full of life”. “Logan was a much-loved son, brother, grandson,
  great-grandson, cousin and friend to many,” the statement read. “He had an
  infectious personality and a beautiful smile. Everyone wanted to be where
  Logan was. He was a little boy who was so full of life and wanted to make
  everyone laugh. He made every day worth living. “Logan was everyone’s therapy
  person; their calm, and he will be missed more than we can ever put into
  words. We are taking comfort from the words of support we have received while
  we take time to come to terms with the untimely loss of our blue-eyed boy.”
  Logan’s relatives were being supported by specialist officers, police added.
  Winsford academy, the school Logan attended, posted on its website: “We are
  deeply saddened by the recent tragic news involving one of our students. Our
  thoughts are with the family and all those affected at this incredibly
  difficult time. As a school community, we will be offering support to
  students, staff and families.” A GoFundMe page set up by family friends in
  memory of Logan had raised more than £13,000 by Monday morning to help
  relatives. Investigating officers have urged witnesses or anyone with useful
  information to contact them via the website or on 101, quoting IML-2165641.
