  The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, presided over talks about growing the Australian
  economy on day two of the economic reform roundtable. As proceedings wrapped
  up, Chalmers said “there is a real prospect of a useful consensus emerging on
  a number of key reform areas”. Here are five takeaways from Parliament House:
  Progress on budget sustainability The government is optimistic about efforts
  to lower spending, including on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and
  the age pension. The social services minister, Tanya Plibersek, on Tuesday
  announced plans to end the freeze on the deeming rate used to calculate
  welfare payments. The freeze has cost the budget about $1.8bn. Plibersek said
  a phased return to pre-Covid settings is appropriate as inflation pain eases
  for households. Separately, the health minister, Mark Butler, said the 8%
  growth target for the NDIS was “simply unsustainable”. Growth is now closer to
  11%. Butler wants it cut to 5 or 6%. Butler is expected to join a session on
  efficient and high-quality government services, spending and care at the
  summit on Thursday. The AI era dawns Business leaders and experts talk up the
  potential of AI, but the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, backed a
  worker-centric approach to rolling out the technology. Danielle Wood, the
  Productivity Commission’s chair, said AI could lift the average workers’
  income by $4,300 per year over the next 10 years. While acknowledging AI’s
  potential, McManus said “we shouldn’t just say automatically we are all going
  to be better off because of AI – we’ve got to make sure we are”. “It may boost
  productivity, it may also just boost profits.” McManus said she wasn’t
  advocating for “over regulating” AI. But she said there was a “doomer” view of
  the technology that comes with the fear of a “Trump-billionaire, let-it-rip”
  approach. “People have got to trust AI to deliver good outcomes. You are going
  to get better outcomes if you involve people in the use of it.” Environmental
  reforms gather pace A discussion on better regulation and approvals involved
  the environment minister, Murray Watt, who is in charge of the rewrite of the
  Howard-era Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC).
  Kelly O’Shanassy, the Australian Conservation Foundation chief, said increased
  productivity was meaningless if the planet was overheated and natural
  environment was lost. O’Shanassy welcomed signs of consensus on legally
  enforceable national standards, as well as the establishment of areas for
  critical developments such as housing and renewable energy. However, there was
  no consensus about the powers of the planned independent environment
  protection agency. Business wants the federal government to retain approval
  powers. “We went into the room a bit worried that people would have a kneejerk
  reaction of ‘just get rid of the EPBC Act’, or ‘just devolve all the
  responsibilities to the states’ or ‘fast track environmental approvals for
  renewables and housing’,” O’Shanassy said. “None of that was the reality. I
  think there was support for better, smarter regulation that has increased
  protections for nature.” National Construction Code With most agreeing that we
  need to make it easier to build homes, Daniel Mookhey, the New South Wales
  treasurer, and the Business Council of Australia’s chief executive, Bran
  Black, strongly supported a temporary freeze of the national construction
  code. Mookhey, speaking on the sidelines of the roundtable, said a pause in
  adding new federal regulations would “certainly” lead to more homes being
  built. “If the national code is frozen it gives us a bit more time to get the
  interactions between national standards and state standards clear. But
  equally, it will give a lot of confidence to people who are looking to build
  right now.” Black was more circumspect on whether there was widespread support
  for pausing the NCC, saying “there isn’t agreement on that within the room”.
  The Australian Council of Social Service boss Cassandra Goldie told the
  meeting a freeze might be bad for vulnerable people and flexibility was
  required to improve the standards of housing, including in the rental market.
  Meanwhile, the former industry minister Ed Husic said he was concerned about
  the proposed pause to the code. Husic said the former Coalition government had
  frozen new homebuilding regulations, only to rush through a mass of changes in
  a short period of time. “People who’ve lived in older homes with regulations
  that weren’t as strong understand why livability is such an issue.”
  Productivity critical for living standards The Productivity Commission’s
  Danielle Wood reminded people that “it’s productivity that drives improvements
  in living standards”. Average productivity growth in the decade to 2024 had
  slumped to a 60-year low of 0.4%, she said. According to slides obtained by
  Guardian Australia, she blamed the slowdown on the waning boost from
  technology, low rates of business investment, a less dynamic economy, and a
  lack of interest in pro-growth policy reforms. The shift to more
  labour-intensive service industries, such as the care sector, has also played
  its part in the productivity decline. The PC boss then ran through the
  commission’s “five pillar” interim reports. She said smarter regulation was
  needed for approvals for building homes and green energy projects. “Australia
  needs 10,000kms of new transmission lines and a six-fold increase in
  grid-scale renewable energy to reach net zero by 2050,” her presentation
  slides noted. But the average time for a decision under the EPBC for clean
  energy projects was more than 500 days, while 45 projects from 2018 to 2022
  were still undecided as of November 2024. It was a similar story in housing,
  where Wood said the time it takes to construct a building is a small fraction
  of the time it takes to complete a home. “An apartment complex that takes
  seven to 10 years to develop can be built in one to two years.”
