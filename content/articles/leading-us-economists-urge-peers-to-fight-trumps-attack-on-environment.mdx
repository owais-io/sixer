  Three leading US economists are urging their peers around the world to push
  back against Donald Trump’s attack on environmental laws. In what amounts to a
  call to action to economists, the trio say rollback of environmental
  regulations is “inconsistent or antithetical” to fundamental principles of
  economics over how to allocate the world’s limited resources for the greatest
  possible value to society. The economists, Catherine L Kling, Stephen Polasky,
  and Kathleen Segerson, say the Trump administration, by focusing on tearing
  down environmental protections, is likely to reduce rather than increase
  economic efficiency, and its policies are a threat to Americans and the rest
  of the world. Writing in the journal Environmental and Resource Economics,
  they urge economists to challenge from an economic perspective the
  administration’s undermining of science on climate and the environment. “Now
  is a crucial time to push back against policy changes resulting in inefficient
  outcomes and the major reductions of funding for environmental research,” they
  write. “Economists have a wealth of knowledge and expertise that can help to
  explain the importance of effective and efficient environmental policy and
  expose weaknesses in Trump administration policies. “Economists can use their
  voice to educate the wider public on what is happening and what is at stake.”
  They urge economists to advise local and national NGOs on environment and
  climate, to make public statements, broadcast podcasts, and to inform the
  public. They identify key reversals of climate and environmental laws by Trump
  including: Withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Eliminating
  consideration in federal policy of the well-established effects of climate
  breakdown on public welfare. Executive orders to “drill baby drill” giving
  priority to fossil fuel energy production. Ending research funding on
  environment and climate and the collection of environmental data. Reducing
  investments and regulations designed to tackle lead and forever chemicals in
  drinking water. “By being tireless advocates for rigorous science and
  providing unbiased information, economists can help to overcome the current
  undermining of sound environmental policy and science and improve the odds
  that governments adopt efficient and effective environmental policies that
  improve health and welfare,” they say. The economists argue the environmental
  policies Trump has discarded are all backed by economic principles around the
  efficient application of resources to ensure the greatest good. Investment to
  remove lead in drinking water, for example, would generate benefits that far
  exceed costs, partly because economies of scale could be achieved by replacing
  entire water service lines in a neighbourhood, rather than individual
  households one at a time. The promotion of fossil fuels, they say, ignores
  their damage to biodiversity, air and water quality and the climate, which are
  of public benefit. Their promotion flies in the face of evidence that wind and
  solar energy have become the cheapest sources of electricity production in the
  US. “Rather than being promoted as ‘clean’ and ‘beautiful’, coal should face a
  hefty tax for the damages associated with CO2 emissions and emissions of other
  air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and mercury,” they
  write. The economists are taking on Trump at a time when the administration is
  attacking academics who speak out against the president’s policies, including
  threatening the funding of Harvard and other institutions. More than 1,000
  scientists are to be sacked from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is
  eliminating its scientific research office, despite its mission to protect
  public health and the environment. Alistair Munro, a professor at the National
  Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo and editor of Environmental and
  Resource Economics, said the Trump administration was the challenge of the
  moment. “In the face of the anti-science actions of the current US
  administration, regulators and governments in the UK and Europe need to step
  up their support for science-based protection of the environment and human
  health,” he said.
