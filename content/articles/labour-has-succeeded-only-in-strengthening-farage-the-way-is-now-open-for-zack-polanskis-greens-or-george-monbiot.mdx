  There’s an obvious way to destroy Nigel Farage’s political momentum. A poll by
  the research group Persuasion UK, testing various messages, found that by far
  the most effective line of attack is highlighting his complicity with
  corporate interests. The message that hit hardest was that Farage’s real
  loyalties lie with “the rich, the powerful, his mates in big business”, and
  his “party” (actually a business called Reform 2025 Ltd) “has taken over £2m
  from fossil fuel lobbyists, polluters, and climate change deniers … He’s not
  smashing the system. He and his rich friends basically are the system.” But
  this is a string Labour cannot yank, as it would pull its own roof down. If
  there is a defining mark of Keir Starmer’s administration, it is immediate
  capitulation to powerful lobby groups, especially corporations and
  billionaires. This is what explains the otherwise inexplicable: its planning
  policy, tax policy, competition policy, deregulation policy, AI policy, food
  policy, its plans to reboot private partnerships in the NHS, its banning of
  Palestine Action. Nor can the government point out the blindingly obvious:
  that it is not asylum seekers who jack up rents, undermine the NHS, hold down
  wages and keep people insecure, but capital. It cannot tell us that the role
  of the hard right is to shift the blame for decades of economic attacks by the
  rich and powerful on to powerless people who have only just arrived here. This
  would mean mentioning capital, wealth and power: topics it avoids like the
  plague. In other words, the government has flunked the simplest test for a
  Labour administration: how to respond to an insurgent hard right. A large
  tranche of evidence from Europe and around the world shows that if you seek to
  compete with it on harshness and cruelty, obsess over its themes and adopt its
  rhetoric, you merely legitimise and empower it. But, tragically and
  incomprehensibly, Keir Starmer’s government has done all this, and keeps doing
  it, despite repeated warnings. People who approve of Farage will vote for him,
  emboldened by a Labour party that has told them, in effect, that he is right.
  People who hate Farage will vote not only against him, but also against a
  government seen to be handing the country on a plate to him. Unless its MPs
  rebel and defenestrate Starmer and Rachel Reeves, it is hard to see any
  trajectory for Labour now, other than electoral wipeout. All this presents
  voters with a massive problem. When a dominant party opposes the principles
  and people it once existed to serve, we are left reeling, disoriented, lost.
  But it also presents an equally large opening. Farage remains deeply unpopular
  in the UK; he has merely stepped into a gaping vacuum of disillusionment and
  despair. The opportunities for progressive politicians to seize this moment,
  to even greater effect, are simply waiting to be taken. I have no party
  loyalties: as a journalist, I feel I should stand apart, and as a pragmatist
  I’m happy to go with whatever works. But I’m happy to see the election, on a
  huge majority, of Zack Polanski as Green party leader. This is not because I
  disrespect the other leadership candidates, who have their own great strengths
  (though they are somewhat undermined, I feel, by risk aversion). It is because
  I believe that his style and emphasis meet the challenge of the moment. His
  campaign video calling out the scapegoating of asylum seekers for political
  failure was the film I’ve wanted to see for a long time. He correctly
  identifies Reform UK as “a party of millionaires representing the interests of
  billionaires, but claiming to be the voice of the working class”. Labour can’t
  talk about that either, as it cannot bring itself to say “billionaire”. He is
  loud and confrontational at a time when nothing else will do. He does not fear
  controversy – a useful lesson any politician can learn from Farage. He
  understands the need both for clear and simple policy messaging – on corporate
  and billionaire power, exclusion and environmental collapse – and for fighting
  the radical right with unapologetic rhetoric. He is much harder than his
  opponents for the media to ignore. He calls his approach “eco-populism”, but I
  feel this is not a wholly accurate description. His communication style might
  be fierce and direct, but it is layered on top of the party’s deep and
  thoughtful agenda, embodied in its manifesto: for example, bringing the
  railways, water companies and big five energy companies back into public
  ownership; guaranteeing access to an NHS dentist for all; greatly expanding
  the provision of mental healthcare; abolishing the Malthusian two-child
  benefit cap and scrapping the bedroom tax; repealing anti-union legislation
  and introducing a charter for workers’ rights; pressing for a maximum pay
  ratio within any organisation of 10:1; enabling local authorities to introduce
  rent controls; replacing the House of Lords with an elected chamber and
  introducing a fairer voting and party funding system, alongside the
  far-sighted environmental policies we would expect, all funded by a much
  fairer and more redistributive tax settlement. None of this changes as a
  result of Polanski’s win, as Green party policy is established democratically.
  Importantly, he seems prepared to strike deals with political rivals such as
  Your Party, which might help to prevent the traditional fragmentation of the
  left vote. It seems plausible to me, through a combination of mass
  disillusionment with Labour, strategic targeting and much greater visibility
  for Polanski’s party (whose policies already represent everything a modern
  Labour party should stand for, but doesn’t) that the Greens could take several
  dozen seats at the next election, and end up holding the balance of power. I
  believe we are now entering a new phase of strategic voting. I sense that
  voters, long treated as idiots by those who claim to represent them, are ready
  to start building constituency movements that decide collectively which
  anti-establishment candidate to back. This opens vast territories for all
  those – whether it be the Greens, Your Party, the more radical Liberal
  Democrats, or dissident Labour candidates – who are prepared to pull the
  strings the Labour leadership will not and cannot pull: the heartstrings of a
  country that retains a sense of justice, of dignity and of fury towards the
  predations of an economic elite. Those who can channel this anger, who can
  speak the language of outrage and hope, are the politicians of the moment.
  They will contribute to what could prove to be, in 2029, the greatest
  electoral reset in our modern history. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist
