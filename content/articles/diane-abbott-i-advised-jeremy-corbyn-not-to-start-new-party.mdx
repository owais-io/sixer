  Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend Jeremy Corbyn not to
  launch a new political party because she believed it would struggle to make
  inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott, the MP for Hackney North
  and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be leaving Labour in favour
  of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair having worked closely
  together in the past. Speaking at the Edinburgh international book festival in
  conversation with the campaigner and commentator Talat Yaqoob, Abbott
  confirmed she had spoken to Corbyn before the party’s launch to warn him
  against it. “There were people around Jeremy encouraging him to set up a new
  party and I told him not to,” she said. “It’s very difficult under the
  first-past-the-post system for a new party to absolutely win. If it wasn’t
  first past the post then you can see how a new party could come through, but I
  understand why he did it.” Abbott described Zarah Sultana, the independent MP
  launching the new party with Corbyn, as a “lovely person who is full of
  energy”. She said the party could get votes and support from people who were
  “not necessarily leftwing” but were “disappointed about the way [Labour has]
  gone in the past year”. Abbott, who as the longest-serving female MP has the
  honorary title of mother of the house, is suspended by Labour. She lost the
  party whip in April 2023 after she wrote a letter to the Observer in which she
  argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experienced prejudice but not
  racism, and likened their experience to that of people with red hair. She said
  the letter published was a draft version and that her comments had been taken
  out of context. She was readmitted to the party in time to hold her seat at
  the general election. But she was suspended again last month after telling the
  BBC in an interview that she did not regret the remarks. Abbott said in
  Edinburgh: “I think she and Jeremy are a great combination but at this point
  in time, it’s difficult to see how a brand new party wins. However, I think
  Jeremy’s party is going to do a lot better than people think, because a lot of
  people are not necessarily terribly leftwing. People are a tiny bit
  disappointed about the way we’ve gone in the past year.” Asked whether she
  thought she would ever be accepted at the heart of the Labour party, Abbott
  said: “I think I am at the heart of the Labour party, it’s other people who
  aren’t.” She was speaking at the festival about her book A Woman Like Me,
  during which she also said Keir Starmer had been “timid on Gaza” and that the
  proscription of Palestine Action was “absolutely dreadful”.
