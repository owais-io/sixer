  Nestlé has dismissed its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after an
  investigation into an “undisclosed romantic relationship” with a subordinate
  that was found to have breached its code of business conduct. The
  Swiss-headquartered multinational named Philipp Navratil as his replacement.
  Nestlé said Freixe’s departure after 40 years at the company followed an
  investigation overseen by its chair, Paul Bulcke, and lead independent
  director, Pablo Isla, with the support of outside counsel, into the
  relationship with a direct subordinate in breach of company’s conduct code.
  “This was a necessary decision,” said Bulcke in a statement. “Nestlé’s values
  and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his
  years of service.” Freixe took over the chief executive role in September last
  year after Nestlé, which owns consumer goods brands including KitKat
  chocolate, Häagen-Dazs ice-cream and Nespresso coffee capsules, ousted his
  predecessor, Mark Schneider. Bulcke, who Nestlé announced in June is set to
  step down as chair next year, said Navratil was “recognised for his impressive
  track record of achieving results in challenging environments”. He said
  Freixe’s successor was “renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams
  and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style. The board is
  confident that he will drive our growth plans forward and accelerate
  efficiency efforts. We are not changing course on strategy and we will not
  lose pace on performance.” Navratil began his career with Nestlé in 2001 as an
  internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America,
  he was appointed country manager for Nestlé Honduras in 2009. He assumed
  leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and
  transitioned to Nestlé’s coffee strategic business division in 2020. He moved
  to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined Nestlé’s executive board on 1 January
  this year. In September 2023, the chief executive of the oil multinational BP
  resigned after failing to reveal relationships with colleagues. Bernard Looney
  was subsequently formally dismissed from his one-year notice period for
  serious misconduct after an investigation by the BP board and its advisers
  found he had knowingly misled his fellow directors when they sought assurances
  regarding his disclosure of past relationships and his future behaviour. The
  decision meant he was denied more than £32m in pay and share awards. Looney
  was replaced as CEO by Murray Auchincloss. BP subsequently introduced a policy
  under which employees have to disclose intimate relationships with colleagues
  or risk losing their jobs. Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to
