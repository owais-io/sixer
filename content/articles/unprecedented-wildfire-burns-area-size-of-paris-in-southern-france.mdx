  Hundreds of firefighters are battling to stop the spread of a fast-moving
  wildfire in southern France after one woman died and nine people were injured
  as the blaze scorched a vast area of the Corbières hills. The blaze burned an
  area the size of Paris over one afternoon and night and was still burning on
  Wednesday evening, making it the second biggest fire in France in 50 years.
  The French prime minister, François Bayrou, who visited the area, described
  the fire as “a catastrophe of unprecedented scale”. “What is happening today
  is linked to climate change and drought,” he said. The fire, which started on
  Tuesday afternoon, had burned 16,000 hectares (39,537 acres) inland from the
  Mediterranean near the Spanish border. It began in the village of Ribaute in
  the Aude department, spreading across the rural, wooded area of the Corbières,
  famous for its vineyards and medieval villages. A woman died in her home and
  one person was in a critical condition with severe burns, according to the
  Aude prefecture. Several firefighters were also injured. At least 25 homes
  were destroyed or damaged. Police are investigating the cause of the fire. The
  environment ministry said the fire had destroyed the same amount of land in 24
  hours that wildfires typically burned across France in a year. “This is an
  exceptional fire that illustrates the scale of the consequences of the climate
  crisis,” the ministry said in a statement. The wildfire remained “very
  active’’ on Wednesday, local authorities said. The mayor of the village of
  Jonquières, Jacques Piraux, said all residents had been evacuated. “It’s a
  scene of sadness and desolation,” he told the broadcaster BFM TV. “It looks
  like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters
  of the village has burned down. It’s hellish.” Lucie Roesch, the secretary
  general of the Aude prefecture, said: “The fire is advancing in an area where
  all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges
  and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups.” Planes were dropping water on
  the flames but Roesch said: “This fire will keep us busy for several days.
  It’s a long-term operation.” Weather conditions were expected to remain
  unfavourable due to strong winds, rising temperatures and dry vegetation in
  the area, officials said. Camping grounds and at least one village were
  partially evacuated and several roads closed. Residents and tourists were
  asked to remain in their homes unless told to leave by firefighters. Some
  tourists who were evacuated from campsites spent the night in municipal
  buildings. One person told France 2 TV: “I wanted to go back to my house to
  get my things but I couldn’t go in. We’re waiting to see what the damage was.
  When I left, there were flames at the foot of the house.” The French
  president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on social media: “All of the nation’s
  resources are mobilised.” He called on people to exercise “the utmost
  caution”. The Aude department, in particular, has experienced an increase in
  wildfires in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of
  vineyards, which used to help slow their advance. Aude Damesin, who lives in
  the town of Fabrezan, told Agence France-Presse that the frequency of
  wildfires was taking a toll on residents. “I find it tragic to see so many
  fires since the beginning of the summer,” she said. “It’s terrible for the
  wildlife, the flora and for the people, who are losing everything.” Last month
  a wildfire that reached the southern port city of Marseille left about 300
  people injured. Southern Europe has experienced large fires this summer. Fires
  have burned more than 25,700 hectares of Portugal since the beginning of 2025,
  according to the European Forest Fire Information System. There have also been
  wildfires in central Spain, Turkey, Greece and in the Balkans. Scientists say
  climate breakdown is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and
  dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires. Europe is the world’s
  fastest-warming continent, with temperatures increasing at twice the speed of
  the global average since the 1980s, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate
  Change Service. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report
