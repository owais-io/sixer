  Fittingly for this match, the rain teems down once more as the Lions take the
  stage to accept their series winning medals. At the tail of the line, Maro
  Itoje climbs the stairs and says a few words of thanks to the host nation and
  the players. He accepts the trophy, joins the much eulogised “group” on the
  stage and hoists the trophy high as the silver tinsel bombs explode around
  them. Here’s Rob Kitson’s report from Sydney Andy Farrell is content despite
  the result in the game. “I can’t wait to get in the changing room. Although
  i’m disappointed we should be unbelievably proud of what we’ve achieved. Lions
  tours are tough and how we got the job done last week in that theatre is
  something, and these lads have been an absolute joy to work with. Australia
  thoroughly deserved to win, they played the conditions brilliantly and their
  set piece was better today. “This has been the time of our lives and that
  sounds dramatic, but it’s the truth.” Finn Russell has been awarded Player Of
  The Series. “Last week it could’ve gone either way. We missed some chances
  this week and with it being the last game we can’t work on that now. I’ve got
  a lot experience, I’m playing some good rugby, but it’s about the guys around
  me not just me.” Harry Wilson, Wallaby captain “It’s crazy what can happen in
  a week. We were hurting, but a performance like that is something to be proud
  of. This means so much to us, with 83 thousand supporting us and it’s a great
  bit of momentum going into the The Rugby Championship. I’m so happy [Nic
  White] got to end his career like that, he’s a great guy and competitor and
  been so important to us.” Dan Sheehan, captain in Itoje’s absence, is offering
  comments. “It’s a bit gutting to be honest. Our aim was 3-0 victory, but all
  credit to the Wallabies. We were loving it in the changing room [during the
  lightning break] and thought we were in a good spot and it’s disappointing to
  be honest. It’s been a great tour all round, but this leaves a sour taste.” A
  match that began the best part of three hours ago ends with a deserved victory
  for Australia and the series finishes 2-1 to the Lions. 80 mins. A few carries
  later the replacement prop is over 79 mins. A few carries from the Lions lead
  to a penalty against the Wallabies. 78 mins. THe conclusion is that Suaalii’s
  tackle was fine, but Donaldson did take Earl out off the ball. From the
  penalty, the Lions win possession in the Aus 22 and drive towards the line. 77
  mins. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Russell finds Earl who breaks
  into space and finds Beirne who gallops into the 22 and drops the ball in the
  tackle. But wait! The TMO wants a word about a couple of things: Ben Earl
  being hit after he passed, and Suaalii rattling Beirne high in the tackle that
  dislodged the ball. 76 mins. A creative exit from the Wallabies after
  McDermott shapes to kick, dummies and throws infield to Donaldson to find the
  opposite touchline. The Lions lineout is won off the top to Mitchell but he’s
  swamped by gold defenders and penalised for not releasing. That decision
  brings the biggest cheer of the game from the gold forwards, who remain hugely
  up for this despite victory being already assured in the match. 73 mins. It’s
  the proverbial or bust for the Lions now as they start to chuck the ball
  about. They bring to to the left to Sheehan who battles forward and offloads
  to Morgan who can’t hold it. It ends up in touch for a Lions lineout, and in a
  summing of the game Williams steals it for the Wallabies. 71 mins. More
  Australian drives to the line are repelled by a now understaffed defence, but
  eventually the hinges come off the door as McDermott smashes up then reaches
  one-handed to ground it. Extras added. Game over, probably. 69 mins. There was
  a warning in the last attack that another penalty down here was going to be a
  card, and it’s Kelleher who is offside on the next attack. 68 mins. As has
  been the story all match from Australia, a tidy lineout is won. This is moved
  to Ikitau who darts for the line, but the effforts of Kelleher and Chessum
  stop him inches short. The next few phases have the Lions offside. 66 mins.
  The Wallabies were looking to force a penalty from a tiring defence, and
  Morgan obliges by gripping McDermott around the neck in the tackle. The ball
  is in touch for an attacking 5m lineout. 65 mins. Oh dear, the Lions issues
  with restarts from early in the tour resurface when a mix up about
  inside/outside the 22 means Keenan puts a kick directly to touch that he
  wasn’t allowed to. This puts Australia on the ball in the 22 via a lineout.
  They work carry after carry to eat up the clock and Lions energy. It’s not
  travelling far, but that’s a lesser aim at this stage of the match. 63 mins.
  The tap-and-go option is taken by Kelleher and then Morgan muscles up to
  within inches. The balls is recycled a couple of times before Morgan has
  another carry that this time takes him over the line. Russell converts it. 61
  mins. Keenan chases and claims a kick in the Wallaby half and for the first
  time in a while the Lions have phases in the opposition 22. Genge has a go
  before more carries come from the forwards and force Australia offside. 59
  mins. A plague of hands like feet breaks out as neither team can catch a kick
  for a few minutes. Nic White leaves the field in his last Test, one that he’s
  had his usual impact on. There’s a huge ovation as he high fives his
  replacement, Tate McDermott. 57 mins. The Lions attempt to claw their way
  back, this time from possession on the Aus 10m line. There is a nice pattern
  run via Farrell looping run, but again the timing is off and the ball is on
  the ground from a knock-on. 55 mins. It’s a familiar story for the Lions as
  they win a lineout and run through some passes in the backs before the ball is
  lost, this time by Aki overrunning the ball. This time the first to the fumble
  on the touchline is Jorgensen who scoops it up and races to the line.
  Conversion added 52 mins. Wilson has a strong run with the ball in the Lions
  half, but he’s a little exposed and that is all the chance Morgan needs to
  clamp on and win a penalty. Sheehan finds Chessum in the lineout but the ball
  is lost in midfield as more handling errors creep in. 49 mins. The ball breaks
  to Russell just inside his own half. He’s surrounded by defenders and quick as
  a flash spots Jones on the right touchline and finds him with a diagonal chip.
  A wonderful kick. Jones moves forward and puts a chip of his own directly into
  touch. A not so wonderful kick. 47 mins. There is some territory for the Lions
  after they win a scrum penalty and dispatch it to touch on the Aus 22. However
  the inconsistent success at the lineout is evident again, with Nick Frost
  getting up in the air to steal it for his side to clear the pressure. 45 mins.
  The ball finds Tupou in midfield who opens up his legs and crashes forward
  like a re-animated oil rig to carry 20 metres into the 22. Kinghorn does just
  enough to stop him and the big prop drops the ball forward in the tackle!
  That’s a huge moment for the Lions as that felt like try coming on the next
  phase. 43 mins. Lynagh puts the penalty in touch to get us back underway Ellis
  Genge (and his new skinhead) has replaced Andrew Porter. The players are
  returning the field. The rain looks to have stopped entirely for now. To
  remind you where we left it, Australia had been awarded a penalty for Porter
  getting involved in some shoving around a ruck. It had all been started,
  inevitably, by Nic White who Jedi mind-tricked Ref Amashukeli into blaming
  someone else, Sky Sports have just told us that the players will return to the
  pitch at 21:40 local time, which is in approximately five minutes. Which
  means, I conclude, that there’s been no more lightning since the first
  incident that took the players off the field. Mark Philp, matchday manager for
  Rugby Australia is talking to Sky Sports “We’re keeping an eye on the weather,
  and we have to wait 30 mins after the last thunder and lightning. If this
  lasts 55-60 mins or so then a decision is kicked up much higher than me to
  consider an abandonment and given it’s the second half the result would stand.
  But we’re not there yet and we all want to get the game resumed for the
  players and the fans.” “I was at a Sydney FC game a year or two ago and we had
  a lightning stoppage.” Leo Bajzert informs us, “I think it lasted 90 mins or
  so. Not sure exactly, because they kept the bar open.” Sounds like that turned
  into a good day. It is very interesting to observe how each player deals with
  this delay back in the changing rooms. Lots are pacing as they try to keep
  warm, some are having a rub down, Owen Farrell is standing still with hands on
  hips clearly trying to keep his mentality right. Finn Russell, meanwhile, is
  sitting with his feet up scrolling though his phone. Never change, Finn. Liam
  S Murray emails “Very different to last week, but gripping in its own way,
  with Tom Curry the pick of the Lions so far. Will Skelton in the middle of
  everything, inevitably, but James Ryan was facing up to him quite well, so
  very disappointed that he’s had to go off. But man oh man, what is wrong with
  that public address announcer/DJ? He’s a bigger villain that Skelton.” Yes,
  can we all focus on the real enemy here, please? What a game so far, though,
  in terms of the full cornucopia of narrative. We’ve had Australia dominating,
  a load of fights, injuries galore, weather selections from God’s tombola of
  disruption and Sweet Caroline soundtracking a serious head injury. So what
  happens now, I sense you asking? The players have left the field and returned
  to the sheds. Play will be suspended until at least 30 minutes after the last
  thunder or lightning is observed. Talk amongst yourselves. 42’39”. Ref
  Amashukeli lets the players know that play is suspended due to the conditions
  overhead. The tannoy is blasting Sweet Caroline as Ryan receives treatment.
  Imagine lying there having had your head rattled by a giant’s leg and that
  utter dreck is piping into your ears. Horrific. A break in play after Ryan
  gets his head the wrong side of a tackle on Skelton and it leads to him taking
  a knee to the head. That will be the end of the Irishman’s game and the
  medical staff rightly take their time to sort him out. Jac Morgan replaces
  him, which will move Beirne to the second row. 42 mins. An early lineout is
  won by Beirne for Russell to launch a high kick towards Wright. It’s too deep
  and the fullback can mark it then tap and go before blootering a long
  touchfinder of his own. The Wallabies receive the ball deep to commence the
  final forty minutes of the tour. I missed telling you at the end of the half
  that Itoje is out of the game, he’s replaced by Ollie Chessum. “Skelton
  continuing to be an absolute grub - how has he not seen the threatened yellow
  yet?” asks Paul Waggott. “An unseemly blot on what has otherwise been an
  excellent Australian performance. Credit to the Wallabies, the Lions look like
  they’re still hungover from last weekend, and the Wallabies have been
  brilliant.” I would argue Skelton has been brilliant also, and has played a
  big role in the performance. The role of evil henchman or full on wrestling
  heel is often as important as the fellas doing the clearing out when your back
  is against the wall. A not totally dissimilar situation from the second test
  here, with Australia showing up strongly in the opening period. There are
  however some key differences. The Lions have not fought their way back as they
  did in the second quarter last week, mostly down to the gold aggression and
  physicality in the ruck, which is up a notch from the last time out. The
  visitors haven’t dealt with the conditions as well as the home side, either.
  Another factor are the personnel changes for the Wallabies. Nic White has run
  the show so far, and added to this Dylan Pietsch scored a great try and has
  been popping up everywhere in defence and attack. Will an eight point lead be
  enough when the Lions bench hammer drops? Stick around to find out. 40 mins.
  Sheehan overthrows a lineout on halfway, Frost nicks it and finds White who
  kick to touch to end the half. 38 mins. Owen Farrell is on due to Freeman
  picking up an injury. He will assume the 12 position, and this pushes Aki to
  outside centre and Jones to the wing. 36 mins. The latest scrum sees the Lions
  get a nudge on for the first time and on the penalty advantage then move into
  the Australia half. The make their way into the 22 via some Conan graft and
  the driving carries commence, but Hooper gets over the ball to secure a
  penalty turnover. Once again, Australia do a better job of defending their
  line compares to last week. 34 mins. Tom Lynagh needs an HIA and so Ben
  Donaldson replaces him, temporarily for now. 33 mins. In the midst of the
  unconvincing attack the Lions were penalised at the ruck. It’s bang in front
  and Wilson tells him to slot it. 31 mins. The Lions secure possession at the
  scrum and the ball the flung to Aki, but the big centre can’t hold onto it in
  the wet and under pressure in the tackle. Australia win the scrum of their own
  and as the rain intensifies once more they reach double figures in phases but
  are broadly going nowhere other than backward. 28 mins. A big call from the
  Harry Wilson as he tells Lynagh to put the ball into the corner from a very
  kickable for points position. The ball is won at the lineout, but the Lions
  tie the ball up in the maul and win a scrum. That feels like three points lost
  for the Wallabies. A tricky 5m scrum exit needed from the tourists here. 26
  mins. Australia move forward into the Lions 22 and as the advantage is called
  over the phases and carries continue. Two rucks later the ref awards another
  penalty to the home side as the Lions defence frantically works to repel the
  runners. Nic White is doing an incredible job of leading his pack around the
  field, all rhythms passing and go forward. 24 mins. When the dust settles the
  Lions win a lineout and fire the ball to Russell who drops it forward. Another
  great scrum from the Aussies wins a penalty but they will play on with the
  advantage in the bank as the ball is out and moving. 22 mins. A full on
  pasty-fest has set off around the Lions 22! Nic White shoved Dan Sheehan near
  a ruck, which set off a bit of a wrestle and that was all the invitation Will
  Skelton needed to wade in, including pulling James Ryan’s scrum-cap. This set
  of at least three splinter rammies all about the place. All very good fun,
  let’s be honest. The upshot of it is Skelton penalised for being a massive
  nuisance. 21 mins. The Lions try to get some go-forward via a trademark Aki
  carry, but he is swamped by gold defenders who hold him up, wrap the ball and
  win a maul scrum. This is then backed up by a big shove by the Wallabies pack
  winning a penalty. 18 mins. From lineout possession stolen from a Sheehan
  throw, Australia work the all in midfield with some decent hands in the
  circumstances. Right up to the point an errant pass is fumbled forward by
  Lynagh. 16 mins. The rain is now almost comical in its ridiculousness; like a
  damp net curtain draped across the screen. This leads to multiple handling
  errors and neither side doing a great deal for a few minutes and possessions.
  13 mins. Possession is claimed at the lineout and as the phases come from the
  Lions, Australia drift offside. Sheehan opts for a tap and go, which is worked
  left but covered well by the home defenders. Gibson-Park moves the ball back
  towards midfield where Freeman is a little isolated and this allows Pietsch to
  clamp on and win a penalty for the Wallabies. A big moment for Australia as
  last week they could repel nothing when the Lions entered their 22. 10 mins.
  The tourists have their first couple of minutes of possession that stalls a
  bit around the midfield. Russell has seen enough and puts a probing kick
  towards the right corner that Wright has to gather and take into touch. 8
  mins. Nic Wright runs to the right from the base of the scrum and sets off
  repeated phases of short passes and carries from the forwards, pulverising the
  Lions defence. Finally the ball is fed to Suaalii who does a fabulous job to
  hold the defence and float a pass to Pietsch. The winger goes aerial to dive
  and finish in the left corner. A brilliantly worked try from Australia in the
  dreadful conditions. Lynagh misses the conversion. 5 mins. A linout is won by
  the Lions in gold territory, but the first breakdown offers a chance for
  Pollard to redeem himself with some brilliant ruck work to win a turnover
  penalty. Tom Lynagh finds a very good touch and as the ball comes left it’s
  drilled towards the corner by a Wright grubber that forces Keenan to carry it
  touch in-goal. The Wallabies have a 5m attacking scrum platform as the
  torrential rain falls. The officials for this third test, by the way: Referee:
  Nika Amashukeli (Georgia) Assistant Referees: Ben O’Keeffe (New Zealand) and
  Andrea Piardi (Italy) TMO (Television Match Official): Marius Jonker (South
  Africa) 2 mins. Billy Pollard is back in the Aussie side at hooker and his
  first action of the match is to chuck his lineout throw in the Lions half to
  James Ryan. The ball is cleared by Russell and a couple of phases later
  Skelton is penalised for hands in the ruck. The match is underway after Nic
  White boots it deep into Lions territory. The teams are out, slightly behind
  schedule, we await the Australia anthem and then a ball will be kicked to
  commence proceedings. “Even if you feel a repeat of last week’s epic is less
  likely, I still hope Australia come out with the same power and spirit this
  game.” ventures Guy Hornsby. “There’s a lot been talked about the ‘easy’
  nature of a potential 3-0 but hubris is always lurking, and both sides will
  want to take that to heart. I suspect it’ll be close until the benches empty,
  but as a Lions fan, I still want a great, close game. There’s no joy in a
  thumping away win when you love the wider game.” Final words are being
  delivered in the changing rooms by the coaches as players zip up their
  tracksuit tops and prepare to head out into the damp night. The obligatory
  hype man is on the mic in the stadium and it won’t be long until we’re
  underway. Euan Clark emails from, I presume, Sydney. “Weather has been like
  this for the past three days. Few minutes of torrential rain, ten mins of
  drizzle then clear for about 30 mins, so expect two or three periods of
  soaking over the game.” As we head closer to kick off, the heavens have opened
  and it is absolutely HONKING it down in Sydney. This will place even greater
  importance on the kicking game from the half-backs and the returning Nic White
  in particular will be earning his corn. Pre match reading How important is the
  whitewash to Lions fans? And for Australians, is a win today essential to the
  journey of this squad with the Rugby Championship incoming? All this and more
  can be shared with me on the email. Joe Schmidt is without last week’s
  difference maker Rob Valetini at flank and prop Allan Alaalatoa, who are
  replaced by Tom Hooper and Taniela Tupou. In the backs, Nic White returns at
  scrum-half for his farewell test appearace, while Dylan Pietsch replaces the
  injured Harry Potter on the wing. The Lions have had a late worry over Tommy
  Freeman’s fitness, but as of writing he’s still in the line-up. Blair Kinghorn
  replaces James Lowe on the wing and James Ryan starts in the second row ahead
  of Ollie Chessum. Andy Farrell has decided on a 6-2 bench, with Ben Earl
  returning to the squad. Australia Tom Wright, Max Jorgensen, Joseph-Aukuso
  Suaalii, Len Ikitau, Dylan Pietsch, Tom Lynagh, Nic White, James Slipper,
  Billy Pollard, Taniela Tupou, Nick Frost, Will Skelton, Tom Hooper, Fraser
  McReight, Harry Wilson. Replacements: Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Angus Bell, Zane
  Nonggorr, Jeremy Williams, Langi Gleeson, Tate McDermott, Ben Donaldson,
  Andrew Kellaway. British &amp; Irish Lions Hugo Keenan, Tommy Freeman, Huw
  Jones, Bundee Aki, Blair Kinghorn, Finn Russell, Jamison Gibson-Park, Andrew
  Porter, Dan Sheehan, Tadhg Furlong, Maro Itoje, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Tom
  Curry, Jack Conan. Replacements: Ronan Kelleher, Ellis Genge, Will Stuart,
  Ollie Chessum, Jac Morgan, Ben Earl, Alex Mitchell, Owen Farrell. The West
  Wing’s Toby Ziegler once stated: “They’ll like us when we win!” In the show,
  this was a questionable justification for yet another US war, but the
  sentiment probably sits well with the Lions head coach. It is oft repeated
  that Andy Farrell is a winner and this has broadly been true of his career (if
  you discount Ireland progressing beyond the quarter finals of a World Cup; but
  you can’t expect one man – however impressive – to solve that particular
  historical psychodrama). With the series is already won hopes were raised of
  something resembling a banter team selection for Lions in this
  cherry-on-the-top third test. To expect this is to misunderstand Farrell and
  his history. His 13 years as a player at Wigan delivered 15 trophies in their
  continued domination of rugby league from the 1980s. Key to this domination
  was the culture of his hometown club. Rugby league was never a fully
  professional sport, with players working to supplement the modest income from
  the game and Wigan was the first team to change that. Wigan made the move to
  full professionalism in the middle of Thatcher’s decade and ushered the period
  of their boot relentlessly stamping on the face of the sport for the best part
  of two decades. No one else had the money, the desire or the sheer
  bloody-mindedness to pull it off. Was it fair? Debatable. Was it fun for
  anyone else? I can speak from personal experience as a non-Wiganer it
  absolutely was not. Was it successful? Hell, yeah! This unyielding approach
  arrives in Sydney in a few hours, because they’ll like us when we win.

Which means, I conclude, that there’s been no more lightning since the first incident that took the players off the field. Mark Philp, matchday manager for Rugby Australia is talking to Sky Sports “We’re keeping an eye on the weather, and we have to wait 30 mins after the last thunder and lightning. If this lasts 55-60 mins or so then a decision is kicked up much higher than me to consider an abandonment and given it’s the second half the result would stand. But we’re not there yet and we all want to get the game resumed for the players and the fans.” “I was at a Sydney FC game a year or two ago and we had a lightning stoppage.” Leo Bajzert informs us, “I think it lasted 90 mins or so. Not sure exactly, because they kept the bar open.” Sounds like that turned into a good day. It is very interesting to observe how each player deals with this delay back in the changing rooms. Lots are pacing as they try to keep warm, some are having a rub down, Owen Farrell is standing still with hands on hips clearly trying to keep his mentality right. Finn Russell, meanwhile, is sitting with his feet up scrolling though his phone. Never change, Finn. Liam S Murray emails “Very different to last week, but gripping in its own way, with Tom Curry the pick of the Lions so far. Will Skelton in the middle of everything, inevitably, but James Ryan was facing up to him quite well, so very disappointed that he’s had to go off. But man oh man, what is wrong with that public address announcer/DJ? He’s a bigger villain that Skelton.” Yes, can we all focus on the real enemy here, please? What a game so far, though, in terms of the full cornucopia of narrative. We’ve had Australia dominating, a load of fights, injuries galore, weather selections from God’s tombola of disruption and Sweet Caroline soundtracking a serious head injury. So what happens now, I sense you asking? The players have left the field and returned to the sheds. Play will be suspended until at least 30 minutes after the last thunder or lightning is observed. Talk amongst yourselves. 42’39”. Ref Amashukeli lets the players know that play is suspended due to the conditions overhead. The tannoy is blasting Sweet Caroline as Ryan receives treatment. Imagine lying there having had your head rattled by a giant’s leg and that utter dreck is piping into your ears. Horrific. A break in play after Ryan gets his head the wrong side of a tackle on Skelton and it leads to him taking a knee to the head. That will be the end of the Irishman’s game and the medical staff rightly take their time to sort him out. Jac Morgan replaces him, which will move Beirne to the second row. 42 mins. An early lineout is won by Beirne for Russell to launch a high kick towards Wright. It’s too deep and the fullback can mark it then tap and go before blootering a long touchfinder of his own. The Wallabies receive the ball deep to commence the final forty minutes of the tour. I missed telling you at the end of the half that Itoje is out of the game, he’s replaced by Ollie Chessum. “Skelton continuing to be an absolute grub - how has he not seen the threatened yellow yet?” asks Paul Waggott. “An unseemly blot on what has otherwise been an excellent Australian performance. Credit to the Wallabies, the Lions look like they’re still hungover from last weekend, and the Wallabies have been brilliant.” I would argue Skelton has been brilliant also, and has played a big role in the performance. The role of evil henchman or full on wrestling heel is often as important as the fellas doing the clearing out when your back is against the wall. A not totally dissimilar situation from the second test here, with Australia showing up strongly in the opening period. There are however some key differences. The Lions have not fought their way back as they did in the second quarter last week, mostly down to the gold aggression and physicality in the ruck, which is up a notch from the last time out. The visitors haven’t dealt with the conditions as well as the home side, either. Another factor are the personnel changes for the Wallabies. Nic White has run the show so far, and added to this Dylan Pietsch scored a great try and has been popping up everywhere in defence and attack. Will an eight point lead be enough when the Lions bench hammer drops? Stick around to find out. 40 mins. Sheehan overthrows a lineout on halfway, Frost nicks it and finds White who kick to touch to end the half. 38 mins. Owen Farrell is on due to Freeman picking up an injury. He will assume the 12 position, and this pushes Aki to outside centre and Jones to the wing. 36 mins. The latest scrum sees the Lions get a nudge on for the first time and on the penalty advantage then move into the Australia half. The make their way into the 22 via some Conan graft and the driving carries commence, but Hooper gets over the ball to secure a penalty turnover. Once again, Australia do a better job of defending their line compares to last week. 34 mins. Tom Lynagh needs an HIA and so Ben Donaldson replaces him, temporarily for now. 33 mins. In the midst of the unconvincing attack the Lions were penalised at the ruck. It’s bang in front and Wilson tells him to slot it. 31 mins. The Lions secure possession at the scrum and the ball the flung to Aki, but the big centre can’t hold onto it in the wet and under pressure in the tackle. Australia win the scrum of their own and as the rain intensifies once more they reach double figures in phases but are broadly going nowhere other than backward. 28 mins. A big call from the Harry Wilson as he tells Lynagh to put the ball into the corner from a very kickable for points position. The ball is won at the lineout, but the Lions tie the ball up in the maul and win a scrum. That feels like three points lost for the Wallabies. A tricky 5m scrum exit needed from the tourists here. 26 mins. Australia move forward into the Lions 22 and as the advantage is called over the phases and carries continue. Two rucks later the ref awards another penalty to the home side as the Lions defence frantically works to repel the runners. Nic White is doing an incredible job of leading his pack around the field, all rhythms passing and go forward. 24 mins. When the dust settles the Lions win a lineout and fire the ball to Russell who drops it forward. Another great scrum from the Aussies wins a penalty but they will play on with the advantage in the bank as the ball is out and moving. 22 mins. A full on pasty-fest has set off around the Lions 22! Nic White shoved Dan Sheehan near a ruck, which set off a bit of a wrestle and that was all the invitation Will Skelton needed to wade in, including pulling James Ryan’s scrum-cap. This set of at least three splinter rammies all about the place. All very good fun, let’s be honest. The upshot of it is Skelton penalised for being a massive nuisance. 21 mins. The Lions try to get some go-forward via a trademark Aki carry, but he is swamped by gold defenders who hold him up, wrap the ball and win a maul scrum. This is then backed up by a big shove by the Wallabies pack winning a penalty. 18 mins. From lineout possession stolen from a Sheehan throw, Australia work the all in midfield with some decent hands in the circumstances. Right up to the point an errant pass is fumbled forward by Lynagh. 16 mins. The rain is now almost comical in its ridiculousness; like a damp net curtain draped across the screen. This leads to multiple handling errors and neither side doing a great deal for a few minutes and possessions. 13 mins. Possession is claimed at the lineout and as the phases come from the Lions, Australia drift offside. Sheehan opts for a tap and go, which is worked left but covered well by the home defenders. Gibson-Park moves the ball back towards midfield where Freeman is a little isolated and this allows Pietsch to clamp on and win a penalty for the Wallabies. A big moment for Australia as last week they could repel nothing when the Lions entered their 22. 10 mins. The tourists have their first couple of minutes of possession that stalls a bit around the midfield. Russell has seen enough and puts a probing kick towards the right corner that Wright has to gather and take into touch. 8 mins. Nic Wright runs to the right from the base of the scrum and sets off repeated phases of short passes and carries from the forwards, pulverising the Lions defence. Finally the ball is fed to Suaalii who does a fabulous job to hold the defence and float a pass to Pietsch. The winger goes aerial to dive and finish in the left corner. A brilliantly worked try from Australia in the dreadful conditions. Lynagh misses the conversion. 5 mins. A linout is won by the Lions in gold territory, but the first breakdown offers a chance for Pollard to redeem himself with some brilliant ruck work to win a turnover penalty. Tom Lynagh finds a very good touch and as the ball comes left it’s drilled towards the corner by a Wright grubber that forces Keenan to carry it touch in-goal. The Wallabies have a 5m attacking scrum platform as the torrential rain falls. The officials for this third test, by the way: Referee: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia) Assistant Referees: Ben O’Keeffe (New Zealand) and Andrea Piardi (Italy) TMO (Television Match Official): Marius Jonker (South Africa) 2 mins. Billy Pollard is back in the Aussie side at hooker and his first action of the match is to chuck his lineout throw in the Lions half to James Ryan. The ball is cleared by Russell and a couple of phases later Skelton is penalised for hands in the ruck. The match is underway after Nic White boots it deep into Lions territory. The teams are out, slightly behind schedule, we await the Australia anthem and then a ball will be kicked to commence proceedings. “Even if you feel a repeat of last week’s epic is less likely, I still hope Australia come out with the same power and spirit this game.” ventures Guy Hornsby. “There’s a lot been talked about the ‘easy’ nature of a potential 3-0 but hubris is always lurking, and both sides will want to take that to heart. I suspect it’ll be close until the benches empty, but as a Lions fan, I still want a great, close game. There’s no joy in a thumping away win when you love the wider game.” Final words are being delivered in the changing rooms by the coaches as players zip up their tracksuit tops and prepare to head out into the damp night. The obligatory hype man is on the mic in the stadium and it won’t be long until we’re underway. Euan Clark emails from, I presume, Sydney. “Weather has been like this for the past three days. Few minutes of torrential rain, ten mins of drizzle then clear for about 30 mins, so expect two or three periods of soaking over the game.” As we head closer to kick off, the heavens have opened and it is absolutely HONKING it down in Sydney. This will place even greater importance on the kicking game from the half-backs and the returning Nic White in particular will be earning his corn. Pre match reading How important is the whitewash to Lions fans? And for Australians, is a win today essential to the journey of this squad with the Rugby Championship incoming? All this and more can be shared with me on the email. Joe Schmidt is without last week’s difference maker Rob Valetini at flank and prop Allan Alaalatoa, who are replaced by Tom Hooper and Taniela Tupou. In the backs, Nic White returns at scrum-half for his farewell test appearace, while Dylan Pietsch replaces the injured Harry Potter on the wing. The Lions have had a late worry over Tommy Freeman’s fitness, but as of writing he’s still in the line-up. Blair Kinghorn replaces James Lowe on the wing and James Ryan starts in the second row ahead of Ollie Chessum. Andy Farrell has decided on a 6-2 bench, with Ben Earl returning to the squad. Australia Tom Wright, Max Jorgensen, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, Len Ikitau, Dylan Pietsch, Tom Lynagh, Nic White, James Slipper, Billy Pollard, Taniela Tupou, Nick Frost, Will Skelton, Tom Hooper, Fraser McReight, Harry Wilson. Replacements: Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Angus Bell, Zane Nonggorr, Jeremy Williams, Langi Gleeson, Tate McDermott, Ben Donaldson, Andrew Kellaway. British &amp; Irish Lions Hugo Keenan, Tommy Freeman, Huw Jones, Bundee Aki, Blair Kinghorn, Finn Russell, Jamison Gibson-Park, Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan, Tadhg Furlong, Maro Itoje, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry, Jack Conan. Replacements: Ronan Kelleher, Ellis Genge, Will Stuart, Ollie Chessum, Jac Morgan, Ben Earl, Alex Mitchell, Owen Farrell. The West Wing’s Toby Ziegler once stated: “They’ll like us when we win!” In the show, this was a questionable justification for yet another US war, but the sentiment probably sits well with the Lions head coach. It is oft repeated that Andy Farrell is a winner and this has broadly been true of his career (if you discount Ireland progressing beyond the quarter finals of a World Cup; but you can’t expect one man – however impressive – to solve that particular historical psychodrama). With the series is already won hopes were raised of something resembling a banter team selection for Lions in this cherry-on-the-top third test. To expect this is to misunderstand Farrell and his history. His 13 years as a player at Wigan delivered 15 trophies in their continued domination of rugby league from the 1980s. Key to this domination was the culture of his hometown club. Rugby league was never a fully professional sport, with players working to supplement the modest income from the game and Wigan was the first team to change that. Wigan made the move to full professionalism in the middle of Thatcher’s decade and ushered the period of their boot relentlessly stamping on the face of the sport for the best part of two decades. No one else had the money, the desire or the sheer bloody-mindedness to pull it off. Was it fair? Debatable. Was it fun for anyone else? I can speak from personal experience as a non-Wiganer it absolutely was not. Was it successful? Hell, yeah! This unyielding approach arrives in Sydney in a few hours, because they’ll like us when we win.
