  Sweden is often associated with a large and efficient bureaucratic apparatus.
  It is also often associated with minimalist interiors furnished by simple pale
  woods such as birch and pine. It was therefore fitting that, after two years
  of preparation, the Swedish cultural canon committee presented – in an
  anatomical theatre from the 17th century – its list of 100 works, ideas and
  brands that define Swedishness. In direct contrast to the anonymous grey
  conference rooms usually favoured by Swedish government officials, this
  unusual list was unveiled in a rather un-Swedish fashion. The contradiction is
  striking. It says something about how we think about culture, nationhood and
  identity today – not just in Sweden, but across the west. It also tells us why
  this canon is doomed to fail and yet for its creators, unfortunately, it has
  already succeeded. Originally a pet project of the far-right Sweden Democrats,
  the canon was commissioned by the sitting rightwing coalition, a minority
  government dependent on the Sweden Democrats’ parliamentary support. Since the
  canon committee’s creation in 2023, the tone in Swedish media has been
  critical. Some have voiced a worry that the project is authoritarian in
  nature, some have questioned the legitimacy and purpose of the list and others
  have bickered over the contents of the list itself. Even the Swedish Academy,
  the body that awards the Nobel prizes in literature, declined to participate
  in the project, seeing a canon as “a concept imbued with power and the
  exercise of power”. Criticism has not died down since the 100 “winners” came
  to light. Abba, for instance, did not make the cut, and neither did Swedish
  meatballs. The final selection is a smorgasbord (also excluded, ironically) of
  predictable choices scattered throughout history, from the Revelations of St
  Bridget to Pippi Longstocking. The project has also suffered from an ambiguous
  articulation of its purpose. Perhaps aware of the extensive criticism, the
  people behind the list have been unclear as to its ultimate goal. It “should
  be a living and useful tool for education, community and inclusion”, according
  to culture minister Parisa Liljestrand. Chairman of the canon committee Lars
  Trägårdh, meanwhile, called it “a departure hall, not a final destination”.
  What this means in practice is open to interpretation. When people are asked
  about what comes next, no one seems to have an answer other than a website and
  some vague hopes. Will it form a part of the school curriculum? Such a move
  might prove controversial in a country that shuns direct political
  interference. Will the list be updated regularly? Unknown. Perhaps it will be
  shelved in a cabinet in a moss-covered vault, abandoned to time like countless
  government inquiries. Stranger yet, this is the government’s flagship cultural
  “reform” project. For a decade, reactionaries worldwide have raged against the
  “woke” policing of words. Yet when in power, it is they who cling to lists of
  approved terms, to conceptual frameworks of consensus and to a strong state,
  pointing a guiding finger. Meanwhile the infrastructure of Swedish culture is
  decaying. The very institutions that sustain and disseminate the works and
  ideas in the canon – the universities, museums and theatres – are in crisis.
  Budget cuts and rising rents, as well as a culture minister who shamelessly
  defends her lack of cultural literacy, render the list a parody. There is
  something disingenuous about the whole venture. Denmark introduced a similar
  official cultural canon in 2006. It was quickly forgotten, having failed in
  its goal to foster integration despite being included in the school
  curriculum. Swedish politicians could have learned from that. But perhaps the
  true object of the canon, beyond providing a useful smokescreen, is the debate
  itself. The introduction of the idea of a national cultural canon implicitly
  suggests Swedishness, unity – what Benedict Anderson would have called the
  “imagined community” of the nation state. Whether the reply is that a canon
  should emerge organically or merely that meatballs deserve inclusion, the
  premise is accepted: that there exists a national culture which can be
  defined. Scholars from Hobsbawm to Herrnstein Smith have shown that when
  states try to “fix” culture, they inevitably fabricate it – yet even that
  misses the point. In this everlasting culture war, the right has mastered the
  art of shifting the frontlines while leaving the opposition unsure if a battle
  even took place. The opposition is left fumbling within the new borders that
  the right has imposed on them. In this sense, the Swedish cultural canon is no
  sideshow. It epitomises a larger ideological struggle across Europe and the
  world. If history is any guide, Sweden’s new canon will soon be lost to time,
  vanishing as quickly as any other listicle. Anyone curious about Swedishness
  can already find most of it online. The canon’s real success lies elsewhere:
  in framing what it means to become and to be Swedish. The very notion of a
  nation – of a community forged around culture rather than individuals engaged
  with singular cultural expressions – emerges triumphant. Culture has never
  been just a common inheritance or simply a series of atomised encounters. It
  is birthed in the tension between both – in the messy, continuous production
  and consumption of meaning across borders and generations. The canon freezes
  that process into a list, and in doing so triumphs as ideology even as it
  fails as culture. If the Swedish culture canon teaches us anything, it is to
  stay vigilant and to probe with our pikes beneath the facade of the wooden
  horse. Gabriel V Rindborg is a writer and cultural critic based in Stockholm
