  A group of festival organisers and grassroots venues have launched a
  “pioneering, gamechanging music collective” to counter what they say is the
  slow collapse of the UK’s alternative live circuit. Blaming soaring costs and
  corporate dominance for pushing dozens of smaller events to close, the
  not-for-profit festival will bring together independent festivals, venues and
  collectives to share resources, cut costs and pool audiences. Led by Si Chai,
  the founder of Chai Wallahs, the Where It All Began festival – scheduled for
  next spring – has been backed by the Music Venue Trust. Freddie Fellowes, the
  founder of the Secret Garden Party festival, has offered to host the event on
  his family’s farm in Cambridgeshire. “The current independent festival model
  has become unsustainable, pressured and too financially stressful for most
  organisers since Covid, which means a wealth of incredible grassroots artists
  are being denied a fair opportunity to perform and carve out their own
  careers,” said Chai. “I’ve got a plan to save it that will work, but it needs
  everybody to get involved.” The cooperative will operate as a Community
  Benefit Society, with participants co-owning and co-programming the festival.
  A public crowdfunding campaign will launch later this year, offering members a
  stake in how the event is run. “This is a rescue plan,” Chai said. “We’re not
  here to compete with the independent scene. We’re here to help.” The model,
  organisers say, is designed to reduce production and transport costs by up to
  40%, while marketing will rely on shared databases rather than expensive
  commercial campaigns. The aim is to create a replicable blueprint that could
  stabilise parts of the sector most vulnerable to market shocks. Those shocks
  have already been severe. According to the Association of Independent
  Festivals (AIF), 78 UK festivals were cancelled or closed in 2024 – more than
  twice the number lost the year before. The AIF blames a combination of rising
  insurance premiums, energy costs, licensing fees and exclusive supplier deals
  as the main culprits. More worrying, said John Rostron, the chief executive of
  the AIF, was a cultural shift that would heavily impact the future of the UK’s
  music scene. “Where small festivals once served as testing grounds for
  emerging artists, they are now struggling to survive in an industry
  increasingly skewed towards multinational operators like Live Nation,” he
  said. Live Nation Entertainment, which helped launch the careers of stars
  including Adele, Ed Sheeran and Stormzy, was formed in 2010 after a merger
  with Ticketmaster. It was a controversial launch, initially opposed by the
  UK’s competition watchdog. Now the US-based company runs all but one of the
  UK’s major festivals and collectively sells a quarter – or 880,000 – of all
  festival tickets. A Live Nation spokesperson agreed that “pressures on
  festivals are felt from top to bottom, with costs rising significantly”. But,
  they added: “Independent festivals are where many artists take their first
  steps and where fans discover music they love for life. Thanks to the
  popularity and success of some of our established festivals, we’re able to
  partner with and invest in independent festivals and events such as the Great
  Escape, First Fifty and the BBC Introducing stages at Reading and Leeds.” Chai
  said Where It All Began was not attempting to scale up or rival that
  dominance. Instead, it is designed to protect what remains. Already, nine
  independent venues and collectives have signed on to take part in the first
  edition. More are expected to join before the public campaign opens. Rostron
  believes that Chai’s model is “pioneering and gamechanging”. He added: “It is
  an interesting and creative potential solution to the current crisis that
  might just get us over the line by sharing the risk of holding a festival that
  is now too great to be shouldered by any one organiser on their own.” Fellowes
  said the new model was “necessary, hopeful and long overdue”. “It fills a
  vital role in the development, patronage and support of artists, without which
  the growth of creativity will be stunted,” he said. But Chai said the
  collective was not dealing in hope. It was, he said, focused on survival. “If
  this works, it won’t just be a festival,” he said. “It will be proof that
  independents still have power when they act together.”
