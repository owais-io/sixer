  A family say their lives have been ruined after a video of a black man and his
  brother playing in the park with his white granddaughters was shared by Tommy
  Robinson and weaponised by the far right. Olajuwon Ayeni, a musician from
  Redcar, North Yorkshire, has been racially abused and falsely labelled a
  paedophile in the week since the family video was stolen from the TikTok
  account of his wife, Natalie, whom he married five years ago, and shared by
  extremists online. On Tuesday, the couple’s local MP, Anna Turley, was forced
  to write a letter providing a reference of good character for Ayeni when he
  was suspended by his management after the online disinformation. “I’m
  devastated to receive the email from my management,” Ayeni said. “Music is my
  life. My social media will be damaged, my career will be tarnished … but I am
  determined to show the truth and hopefully clear it up.” He and Natalie say
  they have been living in fear since being threatened in the street after
  Robinson shared the video with his 1.4 million followers. The far-right
  activist wrote on his X account: “Wtf is even going on here? Where are the
  parents?!” Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has not removed
  the video despite numerous replies debunking it and calling for him to delete
  it. Ayeni and his wife have been scared to leave their house because of
  threats. “We haven’t gone outside at home, we just can’t,” Natalie said. “Just
  after it started to go viral, someone in the local pub recognised Olajuwon
  immediately; we couldn’t believe how quick it had spread. We were walking home
  from shops just streets from our house, and two lads passed us, spun round and
  said ‘I hope you’re not them off that video or we’re coming back to slash you
  up’. It’s just horrendous. “Someone was shouting ‘paedophile’ outside the
  house the other night, so I rang the police again but they say there’s little
  they can do. It feels a matter of time before something bad happens. We tried
  to go out yesterday and had to come home.” The impact on Ayeni has been
  particularly severe. “I feel I have to sleep with one eye open,” he said. “I
  feel unsafe, scared and sad, as mine and my brother’s lives have been
  threatened. Someone said they will seek revenge and I’ll never walk again, all
  for just being in the park with the kids I love on a family day out. It’s been
  twisted by haters and wicked people.” Natalie said: “The distress this is
  causing is unreal, it’s ruined our lives and there we were, getting on with
  things, looking after the girls minding our own business and now we are scared
  to do anything. It’s made me quite poorly to be honest and the shares, views
  and vile comments just keep going. I’ve had to stop looking. “We just want
  people to know the truth,” Natalie added. “We’re a normal family who went to
  the park with our grandchildren. The lies and racism have turned our lives
  upside down and continue to do so daily.” Despite reporting threats to police,
  the family said they had received only limited support. Officers have told
  them that while personal threats are criminal, sharing the video does not
  constitute a crime. Cleveland police said they were offering the family all
  available support and advice. The Redcar and Cleveland local policing
  superintendent, Emily Harrison, added: “Cleveland police would also urge
  social media users to refrain from further sharing either the video or any
  incorrect information about the people featured.”
