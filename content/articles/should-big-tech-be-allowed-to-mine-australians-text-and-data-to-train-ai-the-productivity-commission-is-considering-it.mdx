  The Productivity Commission is examining whether technology firms should be
  exempt from copyright rules that stop companies mining text and data to train
  artificial intelligence models. The commission, in its interim report into
  “harnessing data and the digital economy”, used copyright as a case study for
  how Australia’s existing regulatory framework could be adapted to manage the
  risks of artificial intelligence. A key recommendation was that the federal
  government should conduct a sweeping review of regulations to plug potential
  gaps that could be exploited by “bad actors” using AI. Scott Farquhar, the
  co-founder of software company Atlassian, last week called for an “urgent”
  overhaul of Australia’s copyright rules, arguing they were out of step with
  other comparable countries. Farquhar said creating exemptions for text and
  data mining to train large language models “could unlock billions of dollars
  of foreign investment into Australia”. That suggestion has been rejected by
  the Copyright Agency, a not-for-profit organisation that collects and
  distributes royalties to thousands of copyright holders. The agency has argued
  instead for the government to create a new compensation scheme for creators of
  content used by tech companies to train their AI models. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email Stephen King, one of two commissioners leading the PC’s inquiry
  into harnessing the opportunities of the digital economy, said: “Copyright is
  a great example of where Australia needs to sit back and ask: ‘Are our laws
  fit for purpose with AI?’ “The obvious harm is that an AI company may use
  copyright materials without providing appropriate compensation. On the other
  side, we want the development of AI-specific tools that use that copyrighted
  material. “It may be possible to say, can we approach AI the same way we have
  approached copyright in other ways, through copyright collections. Music is
  played everywhere, so we have set up collecting societies that are authorised
  under our competition laws, and they act on behalf of singers, songwriters and
  creators.” King said the PC was asking for feedback on other options before a
  final recommendation by the end of the year. “We have a fair dealing exemption
  that doesn’t include text and data mining, maybe that should be an exemption –
  as long as AI companies are gaining legal copies and they have paid for it.”
  In its third of five thematic reports, the commission said artificial
  intelligence could resuscitate Australia’s moribund productivity. PC modelling
  showed that even the most conservative estimate was that AI would deliver a
  $116bn boost to the economy over the next decade. King said this translated
  into a $4,300 kicker to the average Australian’s real wage in 10 years’ time,
  and that the actual benefits could be much larger. The commission advised
  against creating an overarching AI-specific piece of legislation, and warned
  that clumsy or excessive regulation risked stifling the technology’s
  potentially transformative benefits. That message is likely to be well
  received by the government, with Andrew Leigh, the assistant minister for
  productivity, backing this approach. But King said the commission was not
  arguing for a minimalist approach to AI regulation. “It’s not light-touch at
  all,” he said. “What we are saying is that AI is going to make it easier,
  cheaper and faster for bad actors to engage in harmful conduct. But most of
  that harmful conduct is already illegal. “Let’s work out where the harms are
  and see whether they are covered by existing law. And if they are, let’s make
  sure the regulators have the resources and powers to stop the bad actors.” The
  PC’s interim report also backed changing privacy rules to incorporate an
  outcomes-based approach, rather than a “box-ticking” exercise where businesses
  “comply with the letter of the law but not the spirit of it”. The commission
  said the government “should support new pathways to allow individuals and
  businesses to access and share data that relates to them”.
