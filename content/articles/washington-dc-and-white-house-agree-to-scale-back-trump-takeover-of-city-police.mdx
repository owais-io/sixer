  White House officials and attorneys for Washington DC have agreed to scale
  back the Trump administration’s takeover of the city’s police department.
  Under an agreement announced early Friday evening, the US capital city’s
  Metropolitan police department will remain under the control of its chief,
  Pamela Smith, instead of Terry Cole, the top administrator for the Drug and
  Enforcement Administration (DEA), according to reports. A revised directive
  Bondi issued late on Friday referred to Cole instead as her “designee” for
  purposes of directing the DC mayor “to provide such services of the
  Metropolitan Police Department as the attorney general deems necessary and
  appropriate”. Those services, according to Bondi’s two-page order, would
  include assisting federal immigration enforcement, contrary to DC “sanctuary
  city” policies constraining metropolitan police department action on
  immigration. Friday’s pact would also allow the Trump administration to use
  Metropolitan police department officers for federal purposes in emergencies.
  It comes after Washington DC sought an emergency restraining order on Friday
  against Donald Trump’s takeover of its police department, dubbing it a
  “hostile takeover” of law enforcement in the nation’s capital. US district
  judge Ana C Reyes had signaled that she would issue a temporary restraining
  order scaling back the Trump White House’s takeover of DC’s metropolitan
  police if the administration did not alter the arrangement by Friday evening.
  Reyes, during oral arguments on Friday, expressed skepticism that the Trump
  administration has legal authority to run the city’s police force or that Cole
  could effectively take charge of the department as its chief. “I still do not
  understand on what basis the president, through the attorney general, through
  Mr. Cole, can say: ‘You, police department, can’t do anything unless I say you
  can,’” Reyes told a justice department lawyer. The District of Columbia
  attorney general, Brian Schwalb, filed a lawsuit on Friday morning, hours
  after the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, late on Thursday issued an order for
  the federal government to impose a new police chief on the city’s Metropolitan
  police department (MPD). Schwalb says the US president and his administration
  are going beyond legal federal power over the nation’s capital, and he wants a
  judge to rule that control of the police remains in district hands. The
  justice department and the White House haven’t commented. “By declaring a
  hostile takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary
  authority under the Home Rule Act,” the lawsuit says. The Trump administration
  named Cole as the “emergency police commissioner” over Washington DC – a move
  that further escalated federal control of the city – but were immediately
  challenged by local leaders, who then sued. Federalized national guard troops
  were ordered into the city four days ago as Donald Trump declared a crisis of
  crime and homelessness there, amid outrage from opponents. Bondi put Cole in
  charge of the capital’s police department, saying he would assume the “powers
  and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police”. She said
  police department personnel “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole”
  before issuing any orders. It was not immediately clear where the move left
  Smith, who works for the city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser. Bowser promptly hit
  back, saying late on Thursday in a social media post: “In reference to the US
  Attorney General’s order, there is no statute that conveys the District’s
  personnel authority to a federal official.” Bowser included a letter from
  Schwalb to Smith opining that Bondi’s order was “unlawful”and that Smith was
  “not legally obligated to follow it”. “Members of MPD must continue to follow
  your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,”
  Schwalb wrote in the letter to Smith. Bondi’s directive came hours after Smith
  directed MPD officers to share information regarding people not in custody –
  such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint – with federal
  agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement (Ice). But, as a so-called sanctuary city, DC police
  would still be prevented by local law from providing federal immigration
  agencies with the personal information of an undocumented person in MPD
  custody, including their release details, location or photos, and cannot
  arrest people on the basis of their immigration status or let immigration
  officials question subjects in police custody. But the justice department said
  Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for
  continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies”, and the US attorney general
  said she was rescinding Smith’s order. The DC power struggle is the latest
  move by the US president and his administration to test the limits of federal
  authority, relying on obscure statutes and a subjective declaration of a
  crisis to bolster a hardline approach to crime and immigration. Bondi also
  sent anti-sanctuary-city letters to the mayors of 32 cities and a handful of
  county executives across the US, warning that she intends to prosecute
  political leaders who are not in her view sufficiently supportive of
  immigration enforcement. Leaders in Democratic-led cities dispute the
  administration’s characterizations that their cities are overrun with
  lawlessness, including unhoused people with substance abuse and mental health
  issues contributing to an increase in homeless and tent encampments. They say
  that while Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible
  homelessness, the city’s homicide rate also ranks below those of several other
  major US cities and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety
  collapse the administration has portrayed. Trump earlier praised Smith’s
  directive to share information with federal agencies. “That’s a very positive
  thing. I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith’s order. “That’s
  a great step. That’s a great step if they’re doing that.” Bowser, walking a
  tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her
  largely Democratic city, was out of town on Thursday for a family commitment
  in Martha’s Vineyard, fetching her child from summer camp, but would be back
  on Friday, her office said. The Associated Press contributed reporting
