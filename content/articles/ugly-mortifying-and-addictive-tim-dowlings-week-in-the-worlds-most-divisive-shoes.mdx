  Ugly, mortifying – and addictive? Tim Dowling’s week in the world’s most
  divisive shoes

  Back in January, Vogue made a bold headline prediction: “This Freaky-Chic Shoe
  Will Be Everywhere in 2025”. It had already been spotted on models and rap
  artists, and all over TikTok and Instagram. By summer, Grazia declared that
  “The split-toe trend that’s been quietly bubbling for years just hit the
  mainstream”, citing shopping app Lyst, which named the shoe as one of its top
  five most-searched items. The freaky-chic shoe in question is the toe shoe – a
  lightweight, thin-soled trainer with separate, articulated toes. They come in
  a number of brands and styles, and while they may be popular, I can safely say
  they are not “everywhere”. Walking in them in public every day for a week, I
  never ran across another person wearing them. Anywhere. The original toe shoe
  is the Vibram FiveFingers, which has actually been with us since 2006. The
  model I’ve chosen, the V-Alpha Hydro, has a 3mm rubber outsole and a 2mm foam
  insole, offering a close-to-barefoot walking experience. They’re primarily
  designed for outdoor training, hiking, barefoot running and general fitness,
  but they are not designed to look cool. The five separate pockets allow one’s
  toes to splay out more naturally, if not more attractively. Not for nothing
  did Vogue call FiveFingers “the fitness world’s most divisive shoe”. Vibram is
  the market leader in a complex footwear category – not all toe shoes are
  barefoot shoes, and not many barefoot shoes have articulated toes. Some have
  only a separate big toe, for a more cloven-hoofed look. But they’re all meant
  to represent an improvement on traditional footwear. The putative benefits
  listed for my FiveFingers include “zero heel drop keeping you naturally
  planted to the ground”, “fantastic proprioception and feedback from the feet
  to the brain” and “as much natural foot movement as possible”. The FiveFingers
  may provide a more natural fit, but that doesn’t mean they fit naturally. My
  toes don’t automatically slide into their corresponding pouches; they have to
  be coaxed and prodded in. And yes, if you’re going to wear socks, you’ll need
  toe socks, adding another layer of complexity to getting dressed in the
  morning. Even after I think I have my left shoe all the way on, a cursory
  squeeze of each toe pocket reveals that the second one along is empty. Where
  did that toe go? It turns out it’s sharing a pouch with its nextdoor
  neighbour. When both shoes are finally on properly, I take them for a brief
  trial spin. At first, I feel like a circus clown. My splayed toes look like
  two hands of miniature bananas, and the rubber soles slap against the pavement
  like duck’s feet. New wearers are advised to transition gradually from regular
  shoes, because it’s a different style of walking (or running, if that’s your
  intention). After a cautious 50 metres or so, I settle into a more barefoot
  stride – mid-foot strike rather than heel strike, and less noisy. Meanwhile,
  I’m very in touch with the ground beneath me: my toes grip the pavement; I can
  feel every tiny bump and crack. The overwhelming sensation, however, is one of
  horrifying self-consciousness – these are very weird-looking shoes. No one
  comments as I walk down a busy shopping street, and after a while I begin to
  hope no one has noticed – after all, I don’t tend to notice other people’s
  shoes when I’m out and about. Then I look down and think: yeah, but I would
  notice these. Any remaining hope that my toe shoes are unremarkable is
  dispelled as soon as I walk into my own kitchen, where my middle son is
  sitting at the table. “What the hell are you wearing?” he says. “On my feet,
  you mean?” I say. “Yes, on your feet,” he says. “The hot girl shoe of summer,”
  I say. My oldest son walks in with his girlfriend. “My God, what are those?”
  she says. “The future,” I say. “They’re hideous,” he says. “They come in other
  colours,” I say. “What are they like to walk in?” she says. “Honestly?” I say.
  “They’re exhausting.” This is true: after just a few hours my feet are
  incredibly tired – not sore or achy, just bone-weary. It takes three days to
  build up enough tolerance to wear them from morning until night. After that, I
  hardly notice them. The fact that I have them on keeps catching me by
  surprise: hey! I think. I’m driving in toe shoes! I’m in a supermarket in toe
  shoes! I am at one with the earth, intensely aware of tiny changes in the
  terrain – the grout between the tiles, the dry grass poking between my toes.
  I’m also getting used to the idea that everyone – everyone – notices. My wife
  is not happy, though, especially when she sees me wearing them just as we’re
  about to set off for a restaurant. “You said a week,” she says. “Today is a
  week,” I say. “You really don’t have to wear them tonight,” she says. “You’re
  just being perverse.” The truth is, toe shoes are a little bit addictive:
  comfortable and light, while also offering a Spider-Man-level of grip. They’re
  also so difficult to put on I’m reluctant to take them off. Once we’re in the
  restaurant, the shoes stay under the table, and I feel perfectly normal. It’s
  only as we’re leaving, when I pass a waitress and smile, and she smiles back
  and looks down, and I see her face change, that I know I can’t go on like
  this. The next day, as I’m posing for Alicia the photographer in my local
  park, a man comes running over to stop his dog getting into the shot. He
  apologises, and then looks over at me: a middle-aged man sitting on a bench in
  the watery morning light. “Is it about the shoes?” he says. “Of course it’s
  about the shoes,” I say. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
