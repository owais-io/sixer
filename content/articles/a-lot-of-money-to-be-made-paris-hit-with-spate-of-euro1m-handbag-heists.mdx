  A series of million-euro robberies of luxury handbags from boutiques and brand
  headquarters in Paris has shown that high-value leather goods are now a bigger
  target for organised criminals than jewels or cash, as French police pursue
  sophisticated gangs targeting designer bags. Paris has been the scene of
  several high-profile robberies of handbags over the past year, fuelled by the
  growing global demand for designer leather goods, which are increasingly being
  displayed by influencers on social media. As designer handbags sell for record
  prices at auction – with the late singer Jane Birkin’s Hermès bag fetching
  €8.6m (£7.4m) this summer – prices are rising in boutiques and secondhand bags
  are gaining value as collectors’ items. Jérôme Lalande, an expert on leather
  goods at the Paris appeals court, said demand for designer handbags was so
  high that the secondhand market was flourishing, making bags very easy to sell
  on. “There’s a lot of money to be made,” he said. “Handbags have come to
  represent social status.” Last month, the Paris showroom of Houlux, a broker
  of secondhand designer bags that sells by appointment only, was robbed in a
  dawn raid. Burglars climbed up to a fourth-floor balcony and in less than 20
  minutes took more than 100 luxury bags by brands including Hermès, Dior, Louis
  Vuitton and Chanel, estimated to be worth a total of €1m. A few days later,
  the offices of the luxury brand Louis Vuitton in central Paris were broken
  into shortly after midnight by two masked men who broke down an inside door
  and took a large number of bags, reported to have been worth more than €1m. In
  May, a large number of handbags were stolen from a Louis Vuitton boutique on
  Paris’s Boulevard Saint-Germain after a car was ram-raided into the shopfront
  in the early hours of the morning, allowing the robbers to enter the store and
  clear the shelves. It was the third such ram-raid on the boutique in only nine
  months. In November, neighbours had filmed a car drive into the same shop in
  the early hours of the morning as robbers dressed in black calmly loaded up
  scores of luxury bags before speeding off. Pascal Carreau, the head of the
  organised crime unit of Paris’s judicial police, said handbags were one of the
  last remaining high-value objects that gangs can target in Paris.
  “Historically, before the explosion of drugs, French criminals, and
  particularly Parisian criminals, carried out armed robberies of banks, which
  in the 1970s had almost no protection at all.” But now, with banks
  well-secured and less cash in circulation, patterns have changed. He said:
  “The teams of criminals who have not moved on to cybercrime are looking to
  target physical objects of value on the market. And all that is left are
  jewels or luxury leather goods.” In January, an employee carrying out a stock
  inventory in central Paris for LVMH, the conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton
  and many other luxury brands, discovered 50 handbags by the label Loewe, worth
  about €100,000, were missing. Examination of CCTV footage showed two suspects
  had entered the building one night before Christmas and exited carrying six
  large sacks believed to contain the bags. Last year, a Chanel shop on Avenue
  Montaigne in central Paris was ram-raided by a car and robbers escaped with
  bags worth between €500,000 and €1m. In 2024, the home of an influencer who
  specialised in luxury handbags and posted photographs of herself posing with
  her bags in Paris locations, was targeted by thieves who stole items including
  bags worth between €20,000 and €30,000. Earlier this year, Paris criminality
  returned to global headlines when a group of men who in 2016 robbed the US
  reality TV star Kim Kardashian of her jewellery, including a £3m 18.88-carat
  diamond engagement ring from her then husband Kanye West, were found guilty
  after a high-profile trial. But Carreau said jewellery heists in Paris had
  dropped significantly to one or two each year because high-value jewellery
  pieces, which were often unique “works of art”, were hard to resell on the
  black market. He said luxury bags, on the other hand, were easier to sell on.
  “The resale is happening on secondhand sales sites. Some of the bags are
  transported abroad and sold the same way across Europe,” he said. This was
  fuelled by the growing trend for acquiring luxury bags spreading across
  different levels of society and becoming much more commonplace, Carreau said.
  “Forty years ago these bags were marginal, now the fashion for luxury is much
  more widespread.” The first six months of 2025 showed a marked drop in crime
  in general in Paris compared with the previous year: armed robberies were down
  by more than 9%, burglaries by 15% and theft of cars and motorbikes by 14%.
  Carreau said raids on expensive handbag boutiques were not a daily occurrence
  in Paris but they had a spectacular impact because sometimes videos by
  onlookers who witnessed events had circulated on social media. Lalande, the
  appeals court expert, said: “A classic Chanel bag that was €5,000 in a
  boutique five years ago can now cost €10,000 in a boutique. So alongside those
  shop prices, the secondhand prices have also risen … There is a global demand
  – from Beijing to Dubai, New York to Paris and London.” Lalande said bags were
  relatively easy to re-sell because they couldn’t be traced as easily as
  watches or jewels. He had seen a shift in criminals’ focus on bags over the
  past 25 years. “Twenty years ago, I was contacted because a [Hermès] crocodile
  Kelly bag was stolen from a woman in Paris. The bag was later found in a bin
  with her wallet that had been emptied. Years ago, a bag would be stolen for
  its contents. Today the target is the bag itself.”
