  Rather than rely on treaties signed in the days of George I, and on the views
  of that capable diplomat Donald Trump (Letters, 1 August), I’d prefer to
  follow the guidance of the international court of justice, which ruled that
  Morocco has no claim to the Western Sahara. If the Sahrawi people really
  welcome Morocco’s sovereignty, as your correspondent suggests, then why
  doesn’t Morocco allow the referendum on the issue that the UN has been urging
  for decades? Peter Loschi Chadderton, Greater Manchester • The Church in Wales
  appointed a new archbishop last week after a delay of only a month. The Roman
  Catholic Church found a new pope after only two weeks. Justin Welby resigned
  as archbishop of Canterbury in November 2024, but the Church of England has
  still not found a successor. How can this be? Dr Patrick Hoyte Wootton
  Courtenay, Somerset • Andy Beckett talks of New Labour’s “centrist
  assumptions” (Opinion, 1 August) and Patrick Cosgrove of Labour’s “centrist
  drift” (Letters, 31 July). If Blair and Starmer are centrist then Harold
  Macmillan and Ted Heath were hardline socialists. John Parkin Nuneaton,
  Warwickshire • How could you overlook A Hard Day’s Night by Peter Sellers
  (From Zooey Deschanel to Captain Kirk doing Dylan: the best songs by actors,
  ranked!, 31 July)? Delivered in the manner of Laurence Olivier performing
  Shakespeare’s Richard III, it’s the most original cover of a Beatles song –
  and the most hilarious. Mike Pender Cardiff • A whole article about the actor
  Ralph Ineson (5 August) without once mentioning his gorgeous deep voice?
  There’s no other quite like it. Ellie Weld Twickenham, London • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
