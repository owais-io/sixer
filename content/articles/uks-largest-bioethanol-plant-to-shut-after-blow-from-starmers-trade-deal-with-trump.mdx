  The UK’s largest bioethanol plant is to close after being dealt a body blow by
  Keir Starmer’s trade deal with Donald Trump. The owner of the Vivergo plant in
  Hull, owned by Associated British Foods (ABF), said it would close with the
  loss of 160 jobs, just hours after the government said it would not fund an
  industry rescue package. The first redundancies will be made on Tuesday. The
  government’s decision creates uncertainty over a further 4,000 jobs in the
  industry’s supply chain including farmers and hauliers. Bioethanol is a petrol
  substitute produced from agricultural products. Vivergo opened a redundancy
  programme in June. At that point the government held talks with the company,
  more than a month after ABF warned that the US trade deal was an “existential
  threat” allowing US producers, for the first time, to compete litre-by-litre
  under a new duty free agreement for American ethanol. ABF and Ensus, the owner
  of the other major bioethanol plant in the UK, said the US deal would have a
  huge knock-on effect on wheat farmers who supplied their plants, as well as
  the UK’s lead in clean fuels. A spokesperson for ABF said on Friday: “It is
  deeply regrettable that the government has chosen not to support a key
  national asset. We have been left with no choice but to announce the closure
  of Vivergo and we have informed our people. “We have been fighting for months
  to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks with government in good
  faith. We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within
  two years under policy levers already aligned with the government’s own green
  industrial strategy.” ABF had warned the US trade deal, hailed as a triumph
  for Starmer, was a killer blow because it scrapped tariffs on a quota of 1.4bn
  litres of imports from the US, the exact size of the UK market, as part of the
  agreement with Trump in May. The US trade deal was a victory for the car
  industry which had tariffs slashed from 27.5% to 10%. The steel industry is
  still facing 25% tariffs but the UK government is hoping these will be
  scrapped after further negotiation. Government sources said they had to
  prioritise the 320,000 jobs in auto, steel and aerospace and added that the
  ethanol plants had faced financial problems before the US deal. Sources in the
  National Farmers’ Union believe Trump’s negotiators had said that in exchange
  for slashing tariffs on cars and steel they wanted US farmers to have access
  to either the British pork or ethanol industries. A spokesperson for the
  Department for Business and Trade said it had taken “the difficult decision
  not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or
  solve the long-term problems the industry faces”. ABF accused the government
  of having “thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber” and the
  opportunity to “lead the world” on clean fuels. The general secretary of the
  Unite union, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a shortsighted decision that
  totally disregards the benefits the domestic bioethanol sector will bring to
  jobs and energy security.” • This article was amended on 17 August 2025
  because an earlier version referred to the size of the ethanol “UK production”
  when UK market was meant.
