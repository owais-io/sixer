  The price of gold has hit a fresh record high, as investors seek out
  safe-haven assets to protect against inflationary and geopolitical risks. Gold
  rose above $3,500 (£2,614) an ounce in Asia, surpassing its April peak. It has
  nearly doubled in value since early 2023. The rally comes as the US dollar has
  weakened and some central banks add to their gold holdings, ditching US
  government bonds, known as US treasuries. At the same time, long-term
  borrowing costs rose to multi-year highs in the UK, France and Germany. UK
  30-year government bond yields hit a 27-year high on Tuesday, intensifying
  pressure on Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, before her autumn budget. Yields
  measure the interest rate which an investor receives for holding a bond, and
  rise when the price of a bond falls. The pound has fallen by just more than 1%
  against the dollar, while the UK stock market declined along with indices
  across Europe. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies fell by 40 points to
  9,156 points, receding from the record intraday high of 9,357 points set last
  month. France’s 30-year government bond yields jumped to their highest levels
  in more than 16 years on Tuesday, as investors rushed to sell French debt.
  Germany’s 30-year government bond yield has risen to a 14-year peak, in line
  with higher US treasury yields, while Italy’s 30-year yield reached its
  highest level since April. Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS
  Global Wealth Management, said heightened political and geopolitical risks
  underline the appeal of gold, which tends to benefit from uncertainty. He
  predicted gold could reach $3,700 an ounce by next June, but did not rule out
  a rise to $4,000 an ounce if geopolitical or economic conditions deteriorate.
  The dollar clawed back some ground, rising by 0.5% against a basket of leading
  currencies, after hitting a five-week low on Monday, before US traders return
  from the Labor Day holiday. The US currency has been under selling pressure as
  expectations of an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September
  meeting have increased, with markets seeing a 90% probability of a
  quarter-point reduction. There is also growing alarm over the US central
  bank’s independence, with Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of Fed chair
  Jerome Powell and his moves to sack Fed governor Lisa Cook. “September has
  always been a cruel month for markets, but this one carries more than
  seasonality,” said Stephen Innes, a managing partner at SPI Asset Management.
  “It carries the question of whether the Fed bends or breaks.” Some central
  banks, including India, China, Turkey and Poland, have been adding gold to
  their reserves. The precious metal overtook the euro last year to become the
  world’s second-largest reserve asset, behind the dollar, according to a
  European Central bank report published in June. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior
  analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: “The share of US treasuries held by foreign
  central banks has been declining for more than a decade, but that shift into
  gold accelerated this year amid US debt concerns, ratings downgrades, trade
  tensions and geopolitical risks. Central banks’ gold allocations even
  surpassed their US treasury holdings this year.” Indian pension funds are
  seeking approval to invest in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), hinting at
  strong demand despite the record price. Silver has also risen, hitting its
  highest level since 2011. “Both metals have further room to run,” Ozkardeskaya
  said. “Yet, with the gold-silver ratio still above its long-term range of
  60–80, silver may have greater upside potential.”
