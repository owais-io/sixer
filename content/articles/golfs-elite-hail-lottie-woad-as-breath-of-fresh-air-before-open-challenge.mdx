  History suggests caution is advisable when assessing female golf phenoms.
  Michelle Wie won just a single major. Charley Hull has reached the age of 29
  while scaling golfing heights, but it is fair to say wild excitement about her
  career when a teenage amateur has not been borne out by subsequent results.
  For a multitude of reasons, promise can outweigh reality. If it were at all
  her style – and it is not – Lottie Woad could claim to have already justified
  the hype. Winning last year’s Augusta National Women’s Amateur was a statement
  of intent. Recent weeks have been rocket-fuelled for the 21-year-old; Woad won
  the Irish Open and challenged for the Evian Championship while still an
  amateur. One professional start, at the Scottish Open, saw Woad lift the
  trophy on Sunday. She is the name on everyone’s lips as the Women’s Open lands
  at the glorious links of Royal Porthcawl,Thursday. “She’s playing great golf,”
  said Lydia Ko, the defending champion, of Woad. “I’ve seen her swing. My coach
  has sent me a video of her swing as well because there’s aspects that I’m kind
  of going for that she has.” High praise. There was more, lots of it. “I think
  what Lottie Woad has done is absolutely unbelievable,” said Hull. “I played
  with her in the practice rounds in Ireland and in the first two rounds last
  week. At the minute I feel like she’s playing with such confidence she can’t
  miss a shot. I think it’s great to see. She’s a breath of fresh air for the
  game. I’m actually really proud of Lottie for what she’s done. That’s like
  goosebumps kind of stuff.” Hull’s own buildup has been beset by illness and a
  back injury. “I’m not hitting it the best, which is very frustrating because
  it’s an event I’ve been looking forward to playing all year,” she said. Woad
  will have Ko and Lilia Vu for company in the marquee grouping for days one and
  two. “I don’t feel too different, to be honest,” Woad said. “I got a lot of
  confidence from the last month, really. I am just trying to continue to ride
  that. There’s always pressure. I don’t think there’s any more than there was,
  like from my perspective, before any of the last few weeks. I was still
  wanting to contend and that’s still the aim.” Like Scottie Scheffler, who is
  dominating the male game, Woad will not talk in headlines. Like the American,
  Woad’s swing can be unorthodox. She has something in common with another icon
  of this sport; Woad is managed by the same agency as Tiger Woods. She serves
  as the latest example of how the American college circuit prepares golfers for
  life as a professional. The Surrey athlete excelled at Florida State
  University amid a rise to the summit of the amateur world rankings. “She’s
  been in a lot of those kind of tougher moments,” Ko added. “Obviously it’s
  different than being an amateur and playing collegiate golf to as a pro, but I
  think she’s been there and done really well in those pressure conditions no
  matter what kind of environment she’s been in. So I think there’s a little bit
  more experience under her belt than what people probably give her credit for.
  “When I’ve seen the coverage or how she composes herself, she doesn’t seem
  like she rushes into things or gets like overly emotional. I’m sure that’s
  going to help her with that transition as well.” Ko’s analysis is valid.
  Woad’s greatest strength is appearing totally unflustered when placed in
  tricky golfing scenarios. Her display of front-running at Dundonald Links on
  Sunday made a mockery of supposed rookie status. In Ireland, she won by six
  shots. “Absolutely amazing,” said the world No 1, Nelly Korda, in adding to
  the chorus of commendation for Woad. “I was very impressed with her composure,
  her process [in Scotland]. When it comes to her shot routine, especially under
  pressure and in the heat of the moment, sometimes people seem to fidget and
  kind of doubt themselves but she stuck to it, she stuck to her process every
  single time. I think one of the main things that I noticed is how mature she
  is for her age and how comfortable she was in the heat of the moment. “You can
  see that she’s put a ton of hours in. Her putting is very solid, her game’s
  solid, she hits it pretty far off the tee. She grew up in this kind of weather
  too, so I feel like she’s kind of comfortable.” It would seem a shock if Woad
  is not in Porthcawl contention. The R&amp;A has increased the prize fund for
  this major, by $250,000 to $9.75m (£7.3m), with the winner collecting $1.4m.
  The male equivalent had its purse frozen for 2025. The scale of growth in the
  Women’s Open is shown by the fact golfers were competing for $3.25m as
  recently as 2018. It was confirmed on Wednesday that the 2027 edition of the
  tournament will take place at Royal St George’s, which has staged the men’s
  Open 15 times. A rare stop for elite golf in Wales has seen players assess the
  local culture. “When I drove from Scotland after I missed the cut last week, I
  saw all the road signs,” said Grace Kim. “It went from English to, not in a
  rude way, like gibberish.” Ouch.
