  The launch party for Earl Sweatshirt’s sixth album was, by all accounts, a
  confounding affair. Some attenders came away convinced that Live Laugh Love
  contained guest appearances not merely by Vince Staples, but actor/rapper
  Donald Glover and comedian Dave Chappelle (it doesn’t, although all three
  contributed to a fanzine produced for the event). At one juncture, the DJ
  announced the arrival of “my brother, Earl Sweatshirt” before the appearance
  of someone who was visibly not Earl Sweatshirt – he was Asian, and apparently
  goes under the winning stage name Gary Underpants – performing a succession of
  Earl Sweatshirt songs. In the aftermath, at least one online music title
  didn’t seem sure whether it actually was a launch party for a new album or “an
  elaborate prank”: would a man whose grim worldview seemed summed up by the
  title of 2015’s I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside really release something
  called Live Laugh Love? Of course, Earl Sweatshirt has form when it comes to
  confounding album launches: Sweatshirt’s last album, 2023’s Voir Dire, was
  secretly available on YouTube under a fake name for at least three years
  before it was officially released, according to its producer the Alchemist.
  And more broadly, this kind of thing fits with Earl Sweatshirt’s idiosyncratic
  approach to his career. On arrival, he was widely held to be the most gifted
  rapper in the Odd Future collective: not even the furore about the
  stomach-churning lyrical content of his debut mixtape Earl (variously compared
  to a body horror film and Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho) could quite
  drown out the technical skill and clarity on display. But while his bandmate
  Tyler, the Creator parlayed Odd Future’s early notoriety into a deserved seat
  at hip-hop’s high table, Sweatshirt seemed intent on taking a more inscrutable
  musical path. His lyrical focus shifted into self-examination of a
  particularly bleak tenor, the precision of his early flow loosened, the music
  behind him became increasingly challenging and avant garde: 2018’s Some Rap
  Songs ended Sweatshirt’s career at major label Columbia in a lo-fi squall of
  jagged samples, glitching beats, tape hiss and buried vocals. Like Voir Dire,
  which paired him with a producer squarely from the old-fashioned,
  crate-digging school, Live Laugh Love isn’t as out there as some of
  Sweatshirt’s oeuvre. There are hooks, or at least samples that dig into your
  brain as they repeat – a harpsichord motif that sounds like it was swiped from
  an old film soundtrack or easy listening album on Forge; Exhaust’s maddeningly
  familiar but unplaceable soul vocal – while Sweatshirt’s voice is front and
  centre in the mix. If the lyrics remain oblique, it’s hard not to notice a
  certain leavening in the overall mood – “Everybody love the sunshine / Shine
  like the boy Roy Ayers say / Can’t throw away my whole life standing in
  shade,” he raps on Gamma – that seems to be linked to new fatherhood. “Both my
  ears are ringing with your love,” he half raps, half sings on Tourmaline, a
  paean to his baby daughter set to a beautiful, cascading loop of strings,
  albeit one regularly disrupted by distorted yells and coughs. Sunnier in
  outlook or not, you’re aware from the album’s start that this is music from
  deep within what some people call hip-hop’s “otherground”, an area in which
  normal rules don’t apply. On opener GSW vs Sac, both its impassioned female
  vocal and its rap – loose enough to feel like a freestyle – sound like they’re
  in danger of falling out of step with the beat; the rap gives way to a barked
  conversation and then the whole thing slumps abruptly to a halt inside two
  minutes. Tracks unexpectedly short out or crash into each other. Live’s
  bright-hued synth backing suddenly starts glitching midway through the track,
  the beat stuttering, the rhythm of Sweatshirt’s rhymes completely changing.
  But if you give yourself over to the album’s weird logic, it’s an enrapturing
  way to spend 25 minutes. The disorientating shifts and non-sequiturs feel like
  observing a dream someone else is having, as on Crisco’s head-spinning melding
  of relentless rap against a backdrop of choral vocal samples manipulated so
  they appear to be slipping and sliding around your ears. Live Laugh Love is
  the sound of someone who got an early glimpse of what huge success might look
  like – packed off by his mum to a correctional academy in the wake of Earl’s
  release, he was the subject of both a “Free Earl” campaign and a lot of
  intrusive interest in his personal life – and decided to inhabit his own
  peculiar world instead, confounding album launches, abstruse music and
  unexpected appearances by Gary Underpants and all. You wouldn’t necessarily
  want to live there full time, but if you are inclined to visit, the scenery is
  dazzling. This week Alexis listened to Steve Lacy – Nice Shoes Lacy has talked
  about his first single since 2022 as a “new language”: certainly, its
  combination of rave breakbeat, sprechstsang vocals, lo-fi soul and squalls of
  rock guitar sounds thrillingly different.
