  A downside to hot weather is all the bugs that can feast on or sting us. Is
  there anything you can do to avoid this? And what should you do if you are
  attacked? Here’s what pharmacists have to say about the best ways to prevent
  and treat stings and bites. Know which bugs to be wary of The British Pest
  Control Association has warned of a rise in wasp activity due to recent
  heatwaves. “I am definitely seeing more wasps around at the moment,” says
  Claire Nevinson, the superintendent pharmacist for Boots UK. “We have seen an
  increase in people presenting with infected insect bites since April.” “It is
  a bit of a shock when you are stung by a wasp,” says Ian Budd, an independent
  prescribing pharmacist for Chemist4U. “It is painful and, if you’re unlucky,
  it can trigger an allergic reaction. Hornets and bees are less aggressive.
  Horsefly bites can cause inflammation and sometimes infection, because it is
  difficult to stop scratching them. Then there are midges, and we do have
  mosquitoes in the UK, not the kind that carry malaria but they can still cause
  issues. And we have ticks, in grassy and wooded areas, some of which carry
  Lyme disease.” It is important to be more vigilant when you are in certain
  environments, says Virginia Chachati, a registered UK pharmacist and public
  health content creator. “Midges and mosquitoes tend to be in forests and long
  grasses,” she says, so you need to watch out if you are camping or hiking.
  Some bugs are drawn to other animals, she adds: “If you’re visiting farm
  animals and want to pet them, just be aware that they may be carrying ticks.”
  Midges and mosquitoes can also be found anywhere there is still water, adds
  Chachati. “Wherever there’s water, even a puddle that sits for a long time,
  bugs can lay eggs and then multiply very quickly – in a few hours or days. So
  make sure you don’t have still water around. Drain paddling pools after use.
  If the bugs are hungry, they will come and bite you.” Nevinson says you should
  take particular precautions if you’re out in the morning or as the sun goes
  down. “That is when the mosquitoes and midges will be at their worst.” Cover
  up with light, loose clothing “Make sure you wear long sleeves and long
  trousers, particularly if you’re camping or outdoors a lot,” says Nevinson.
  Anything not covered could be open to attack. Budd says: “It is quite common
  to get bitten around the ankles and wrists – anywhere exposed is at risk.”
  Chachati advises wearing light colours. “Some bugs, especially hornets, can be
  really attracted to darker colours because they’re trying to hide from
  predators,” she says. “If you’re walking through long grass and you are
  wearing white trousers, it is also much easier to see if ticks have latched on
  to your trousers, and then you can easily pick them off. Definitely wear a hat
  as well, because some people get bites on their scalp, especially if they
  don’t have hair.” Keep colours neutral, as “yellow and bright colours can
  attract wasps”, she says. Don’t irritate wasps “Sadly, it is just being in the
  wrong place at the wrong time with a wasp,” says Nevinson. “Wasps will be
  particularly attracted if you’re having a picnic. If there is food around, the
  wasps will hover around it.” “If you’re waving your hands around,” says
  Chachati, “those air currents are going to really bother them and knock them
  out of the air, and they don’t want to be knocked, so they’re going to do
  whatever they can to defend themselves. Staying really still is a good idea.”
  This is easier said than done: “If they land on you, you could use a piece of
  paper to gently slide under it, and put a see-through cup on top. Then take it
  away and release it.” Wear repellant Chachati has worked in travel clinics:
  “Deet would be the number one thing I recommend, including for children. Use
  the highest percentage that you can tolerate without it irritating the skin.”
  In some places, “if you get bitten, you can get diseases like malaria, dengue
  fever, Zika and tick-borne encephalitis. If you can’t use Deet, there are
  other repellants such as icaridin and IR3535.” “Deet is a really effective
  insect repellant,” says Budd. “But there are questions about whether it is
  environmentally responsible for it to be used in large quantities. There are
  alternatives, like some citronella-based insect repellants, which are kinder
  to the environment. If you are still getting bitten with those, maybe move to
  the chemical ones.” “Always put on your sunscreen, then put your insect
  repellant on top,” says Chachati. “When they land on you, they will be
  repelled by the insect repellant, because that is the outermost layer you’ve
  applied on your skin. Deet can lower the sun protection factor of the
  sunscreen, so you will need to reapply it more often.” It can also transfer
  ink to your skin, so be careful when handling printed matter while wearing it,
  says Chachati. Go fragrance-free “It is a myth that only dirty people get
  bitten,” says Budd. “Bugs are drawn to scents, not bad hygiene.” “Don’t wear
  perfumes, deodorants or moisturisers that are heavily scented,” says Chachati.
  “These can attract bugs to you, because you smell like flowers.” Possibly
  avoid alcohol “There was a very small study in 2002 where they tested whether
  or not drinking beer would make mosquitoes more likely to bite you,” says
  Chachati. “Out of 13 people, the majority of them did get bites from
  mosquitoes [after beer ingestion compared with before ingestion]. So avoid
  drinking beer at barbecues,” which can be challenging, she concedes. Budd says
  it is also a myth that drinking gin and tonic is helpful: “Originally, in
  countries where there was malaria, people would have loads of tonic water
  because they believed the quinine in the tonic protected them – you’d have to
  drink a lot of tonic water for it to be effective.” Clean bites and stings
  before treating If you do get a bite or sting, “it is always best to wash the
  skin with soap and water to try to avoid any bacteria getting inside the
  wound,” says Chachati. “If you don’t have access to soap and water, you can
  use antiseptic wipes or cream.” “In the main, if you just have a simple bite
  or a sting, it will sort itself out,” says Nevinson. “If there is swelling,
  cold compresses are really good. If it’s on a limb, keep it raised to prevent
  that swelling getting any worse.” “Hydrocortisone cream is really good for
  inflammation,” says Budd. If you want to try something more natural, lavender
  or tea-tree oil “may deter the insects, but they’re also natural antiseptics
  once you’ve been bitten. Aloe vera is cooling and anti-inflammatory.” Don’t
  scratch “Antihistamine creams or tablets can really help with the itching,
  because scratching that itch makes it worse,” says Budd. “It increases the
  inflammation and your risk of infection. When you’re scratching the skin, you
  are interfering with the natural skin barrier, and you can be introducing
  bacteria into the inflamed area by taking away all the top layers of cells.”
  Remove stings and ticks carefully “When a tick bites, the whole animal is
  attached to you,” says Budd. “Use fine-tip tweezers, grab it really close to
  the skin, and pull upwards slowly with a steady and even force. Clean the area
  afterwards with soap and water.” Nevinson says: “If a red ring appears around
  the bite, that is an indication that it could be Lyme disease, and it’s really
  important you seek medical help. As long as it is treated quickly, it can be
  easily dealt with.” Chachati recommends keeping the tick to be tested. “Don’t
  use tweezers for a bee sting,” says Budd, “because you can push more venom
  into your skin. Scrape it sideways, either with your [clean] fingernail or a
  bank card. When you get stung by a bee, the sting continues to pump venom,
  even when the bee is gone. So you definitely need to remove that. Wasps and
  hornets do not leave a stinger in the skin after they have stung you, they
  have retractable stingers.” Take antimalarials “Malaria can kill you,” says
  Chachati. Mosquitoes kill more people than any other creature in the world
  because of the various diseases they carry and it is essential to take
  antimalarials if you are going to a region where malaria is carried by
  mosquitoes. “Look at a malaria map or the Fit for Travel website and always
  speak to a professional about which antimalarials to take.” Know when to seek
  medical help “Your individual reaction to proteins in the saliva of the bug
  that has bitten you or the venom from a sting can cause an allergic reaction,”
  says Budd, “from mild swelling to severe anaphylaxis, where it starts
  affecting your breathing and your tongue is swelling. This is usually picked
  up early on in life and you will need to carry an EpiPen. For a mild allergic
  reaction, an antihistamine or hydrocortisone cream should help. If you are
  experiencing difficulty breathing, dizziness or swelling of the face, seek
  emergency help.” Also see a doctor if, “a couple of days after being bitten or
  stung, you notice that there is pus, a hot, swollen red area around the bite
  that is noticeably spreading, or if you develop a fever, as these can be signs
  of infection,” says Budd. Disturb the airflow “Keep the air conditioning or
  ceiling fan on,” says Chachati, “because that disturbs the airflow, so it
  stops mosquitoes from being able to land. It also makes the room cool, which
  they dislike, and disperses carbon dioxide, making it difficult for mosquitoes
  to detect humans.” Keep windows closed for this to be effective, she says,
  “and definitely use a mosquito net over your bed and windows”. Take a shower
  “Bugs are attracted to body heat and sweat,” says Budd. “If your skin is
  warmer, you are more likely to attract bugs. If you have been exercising,
  there might be more lactic acid in your sweat, and insects are attracted to
  that, too.” Some people are just more delicious than others “There is no
  specific reason why one person gets bitten more than another,” says Nevinson,
  “but you often hear people talking about being prone to bites. It is likely to
  be to do with the skin type and the scent on the skin, which could be a result
  of a number of different things, diet or hormone-related.” Budd explains:
  “Everyone has their own unique skin microbiome and it can make you either less
  or more attractive to biting insects. Your genetics can influence this. For
  some reason, people with blood type O may attract more mosquitoes.” He adds:
  “Being pregnant could make you more attractive to biting insects because your
  skin temperature can be warmer.” Chachati says: “It depends on your immune
  system and how you react to bites. Some people might be more sensitive
  compared with others. Mosquito bites may be worse in certain parts of the
  world that you are not used to being in, depending on how your immune system
  reacts. The first few bites may be quite a difficult experience to go through
  and then, if you get bitten again later in the holiday, it may not be as bad
  because your body knows how to handle it better.”
