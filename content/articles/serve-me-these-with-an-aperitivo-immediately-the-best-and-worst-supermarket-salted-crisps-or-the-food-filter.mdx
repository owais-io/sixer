  ‘What I’ve learned today,” says my friend Lucy, stepping firmly away from the
  crisp buffet, “is that you can have too much of a good thing.” My volunteer
  testers and I were enthusiastic about the prospect of tasting our way through
  10 types of lightly salted, crisply fried potato, but we all agreed, once they
  were laid out side by side in anonymous bowls, that it was surprisingly hard
  to differentiate between them. That said, good news: every single one had its
  cheerleaders, so there were no real duds in this sample. To outline what I’m
  looking for from a salted crisp, it should be crisp, obviously. To this end,
  all the bags were opened at the same time, just before the blind tasting. Salt
  levels are a matter of personal preference, though it should be upfront rather
  than a mere seasoning, while, in an ideal world, the potatoes themselves would
  be the primary flavour, rather than a mere texture. They should be cooked long
  enough that they crunch, rather than melt between the teeth, but it’s a
  delicate balance: too long in the oil and they’ll be bitter. And that oil – if
  you can taste it at all – should be pleasant: too strong a flavour, even of
  the best fat, will overpower the spuds. Last, crisps should be dangerously
  moreish: if you can eat one and stop, they’re not good crisps. *** The best
  salted crisps *** Best overall: San Nicasio Himalayan pink salt potato chips
  £3.25 for 150g at Waitrose (£2.17/100g) £74.36 for 14 x 150g at Amazon
  (£3.54/100g) ★★★★☆ The most divisive crisps of the day, with marks ranging
  from one (Rose, seven, and representing the youth vote) to five (me).
  Noticeably yellow, thanks to the extra-virgin olive oil they’re cooked in
  (which, unlike the Himalayan pinkness of the salt, comes through in the
  flavour, hence, perhaps, the loss of the kid vote), they prompt the demand:
  “Serve me these with an aperitivo immediately: crunch, salt, good oil – YES.”
  Sadly, these Andalusian crisps have a far higher fat content than any of the
  others tested. One for picking at elegantly over a chilled glass of sherry.
  *** Best bargain: Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference lightly sea salted
  hand-cooked crisps £1.25 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (83p/100g) ★★★★☆ Though some
  find them a little undersalted, these chunky crisps’ “classic flavour” finds
  favour, with several testers noting with excitement that they “actually taste
  of potato!” While the comments section attracts several variations on
  “mid-range” (Rose judges them merely “OK”), the decent flavour and excellent
  crunch make this a great value choice. *** And the rest … M&amp;S hand-cooked
  lightly sea salted crisps £1.80 for 150g at Ocado (£1.20/100g) ★★★☆☆ Rose
  finds these too crunchy, but that very quality appeals to the person who says
  they’d be perfect for a hangover. “Nice enough,” someone else says, “but
  surprised not to find one I like more.” That sums these up – a decent,
  aggressively crunchy crisp with a high salt content, but missing that elusive
  potatoey flavour. *** Waitrose sea salt hand-cooked crisps £1.50 for 150g at
  Waitrose (£1/100g) ★★★☆☆ “Perfectly fine,” one tester finds, before admitting:
  “Actually quite moreish.” Someone else judges them “generic”. Thin and crisp,
  which divides opinion, from “nothing to them” to “better – lighter!”, Rose
  judges them “too spicy”, but I rather like their saltiness and the fact that –
  hurrah! – they taste of baked potato. I’d buy these again. *** Co-op
  Irresistible hand-cooked lightly sea salted crisps £1.70 for 150g at Co-op
  (£1.13/100g) ★★★☆☆ Cooked skin on, which gives them a decent potatoey flavour.
  There are a few slightly sweet, caramelised ones in here, suggesting an older
  potato, but in general these are crunchy, well-balanced crisps that would
  perform well in most situations, from festival pre-drinks to family picnics.
  “Middle of the road,” as Rob observes. *** Kettle lightly salted potato chips
  £2.38 for 130g at Asda (£1.83/100g) £1.65 for 130g at Amazon (£1.27/100g)
  ★★★☆☆ Fun fact: I once visited the Kettle Chips factory in Norwich and was
  allowed to cook a kettle of crisps, so I can confirm that, as the packet
  suggests, they are indeed hand fried in small batches. They’re not my
  favourite, though, even when cooked by the pros – I find these a bit greasy,
  while other testers judge them “blah” and “cardboardy … does not break when
  you bite in”. Several testers say they “need more salt”, but I’ll let them
  off, given they’re described only as lightly salted (always a red flag for
  me). *** Tyrrell’s lightly sea salted crisps £2 for 150g at Ocado (£1.33/100g)
  £2.50 for 150g at Tesco (£1.67/100g) ★★☆☆☆ “Bang average” sums up the response
  to these. “Wouldn’t put out for guests.” Rose finds them “too bitey” (they
  are, it must be said, very crisp), someone else finds them “bland”, and
  several tasters say they feel “cheap” and “basic”, which is not reflected in
  the price. Disappointing. *** Morrisons The Best hand-cooked skin-on sea salt
  crisps £1.30 for 125g at Morrisons (£1.04/100g) ★★☆☆☆ These apparently taste
  as if “they were opened last night”. “A bit stale,” someone else agrees.
  “Wrong texture, dense.” Personally, I like a thicker crisp, but these are a
  little too chewy and even I find them a touch salty, though, checking the
  labels afterwards, they contain less salt than some of the others, so maybe
  it’s just that the flavour is more intense. Might be better served with a
  creamy dip to balance this out. *** Aldi Specially Selected lightly salted
  hand-cooked crisps £1.09 for 150g at Aldi (73p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ “Too thick, like
  eating greasy batter out of the bottom of the chip paper, and not in a good
  way,” one tester says, and although I love a thicker crisp, I’m inclined to
  agree – these are a bit tough, rather than snappy, and taste, as Rose notes,
  “too oily”. *** Walkers ready salted crisps £1.50 for 150g at Sainsbury’s
  (£1/100g) £1.48 for 150g at Asda (99p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Rose, who confides in me
  that these are the only crisps she knows, picks them out from the lineup in
  seconds – they’re far paler and more uniform than the others – but even she’s
  not that enthusiastic. “Not crunchy enough” is a common complaint, while
  someone else thinks they’re so light, they’re almost “a health snack”. The
  final damning verdict comes from Claire: “An anaemic pub crisp. Fine with a
  cold pint, otherwise lacking.”
