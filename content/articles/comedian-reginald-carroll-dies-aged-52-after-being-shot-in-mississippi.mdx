  Baltimore comedian Reginald “Reggie” Carroll has died after being shot in
  northern Mississippi, according to authorities and media reports. The
  entertainer was 52, and among those who have paid tribute to him was
  Oscar-winning actor Mo’Nique, who called Carroll a “brother” in comedy. Police
  in Southaven, Mississippi, said officers found a critically wounded Carroll
  while responding to a shooting on 20 August. Though he underwent emergency
  treatment at a hospital in nearby Memphis, Tennessee, Carroll died from his
  injuries. Southaven police said one man was arrested in connection with
  Carroll’s killing and has been charged with murder. Investigators had not
  discussed a possible motive in the standup comic’s slaying as of Monday
  morning, though they had made it a point to say it was “isolated”. Carroll
  gained a following while performing in comedy clubs across the US, and word of
  his death had left that circuit in mourning. “Thank you for being one of the
  OGs who supported us early on,” Baltimore’s Mobtown Comedy said on social
  media. “The Mobtown family and the Baltimore comedy community are very
  saddened by this loss of one of our city’s great talents. Sending our prayers
  to Reggie’s family.” On Instagram, the Baltimore area native Mo’Nique – who
  won the 2010 best supporting actress Oscar for her performance in Precious –
  said she had “an amazing time being on tour together” previously with Carroll.
  “This is why I always say treat people the best you can because you never know
  if you’ll get a chance to see them again,” Mo’Nique said. “And the last time
  me and my brother Reggie, girl, was together – that’s what it was, an amazing
  time being on tour together, being on that road together, what a time, so I
  have no sad tears because all of our times together was amazing.” Among
  Carroll’s credits at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an episode of The
  Parkers, a sitcom which starred Mo’Nique. As Deadline noted, he also appeared
  on the live variety series Showtime at the Apollo – and more recently he was
  in the 2023 standup special Knockout Kings of Comedy as well as in the 2022
  television movie Rent &amp; Go. Southaven police additionally offered
  condolences to Carroll’s loved ones, saying in a statement: “our thoughts
  [are] with [his] family”. The agency’s statement also thanked the public “for
  their patience and understanding” as the investigation into Carroll’s murder
  continued.
