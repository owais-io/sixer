  Five democratic US senators are demanding secretary of state Marco Rubio
  facilitate an immediate “massive surge” of baby formula and humanitarian aid
  to Gaza, where infants are dying of starvation. The letter, led by Democrat
  Ruben Gallego of Arizona and obtained exclusively by the Guardian, comes as
  Gaza City and surrounding areas have been officially classified as
  experiencing famine by international monitors. More than 300 people, including
  at least 119 children, have died from hunger in Gaza since October 2023,
  according to health authorities. The letter is also signed by senators Peter
  Welch of Vermont, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elizabeth
  Warren of Massachusetts. The situation could significantly worsen in the
  coming days, as Israel announced on Friday that it will no longer pause
  fighting to allow aid deliveries in Gaza City, as the military prepares for a
  fresh ground operation. “We write to you today with urgency about the grave
  crisis that infants in Gaza face as a result of severe restrictions on the
  entry and distribution of humanitarian aid,” the senators wrote in the letter,
  calling on the US to use its “full power and authority” to meet what they
  describe as a moral obligation. The Senate letter follows a similar appeal
  last week from over 100 House Democrats led by representatives Ayanna Pressley
  and Brittany Pettersen, who first called for a surge in baby formula
  deliveries to Gaza. An August report from Save the Children found that 43% of
  pregnant and breastfeeding women seeking treatment in Gaza were malnourished.
  An estimated 65% of registered voters support the US taking action to help
  people facing starvation in Gaza, according to late August Reuters/Ipsos
  polling. Israeli authorities blocked all aid from entering the territory for
  over two months between March and May and then replaced the UN aid system with
  the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – which delivers a
  fraction of previous levels and excludes baby formula at four highly
  militarized sites around which hundreds of Palestinians seeking food have been
  shot to death. An early August report from the UN’s Human Rights office
  recorded 859 people killed around GHF’s operations since it launched in May.
  While the World Food Programme said Thursday that more food trucks were able
  to enter Gaza over the last few days after a growing global pressure campaign,
  the increase was still far below the 500-600 the UN says are needed to enter
  daily to make a dent in the crisis. Friday’s announcement by Israel that it
  will no longer enable aid deliveries is likely to set any progress back. The
  senators said malnourished mothers cannot sustain breastfeeding, making
  formula “the only option for infant survival in many cases” according to the
  letter. Volunteer doctors entering Gaza have reported Israeli authorities
  confiscating baby formula from their luggage at the border. Gallego is on
  paternity leave after welcoming a baby son in June. He has continued to vote
  in the Senate. “We appeal to you not only in your capacity as a government
  official but as a parent,” the senators wrote to Rubio. “No child should face
  the desperation and suffering we are witnessing in Gaza in real time.” The
  letter reflects Gallego and the wider party’s careful evolution on Gaza
  policy, as polls show overwhelming disapproval among voting Democrats for
  Israel’s war. The Arizona senator, who has been running television ads in Iowa
  and visited the state recently amid speculation about a 2028 presidential bid,
  notably did not vote on either of Bernie Sanders’ joint resolutions to block
  arms sales to Israel last month.Of 47 Senate Democrats, 27 voted for a
  resolution to block the sale of assault rifles to Israel, and 24 voted to
  block bomb sales. Gallego later said he was “re-evaluating” and would look at
  conditioning aid going forward. But movement within the party is proceeding
  slowly. At the Democratic National Committee gathering in Minneapolis this
  week, progressive calls for an arms embargo on Israel were rejected, while a
  moderate ceasefire resolution was initially passed but later withdrawn to
  preserve party unity. Voters are much less divided: a Quinnipiac survey from
  late August found that 60% of registered voters oppose providing more military
  aid to Israel – the highest opposition recorded to date. The same poll
  revealed that half of US voters – and 77% of Democrats – now believe Israel is
  committing genocide in Gaza. The world’s foremost global hunger monitor, the
  Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, said in an
  analysis last week that more than half a million Palestinians in Gaza are
  experiencing famine and projected the number would rise. Israel’s prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called the findings of the report an “outright
  lie”, with the government suggesting the IPC report used incomplete data. The
  senators are demanding swift action from Rubio, requesting a written response
  by 1 September. They call for all crossings into Gaza to reopen immediately
  for humanitarian aid and for Israel to “vastly scale up” access. “This moment
  demands moral clarity and decisive action,” they wrote. “We must use our
  leverage to ensure the most vulnerable are protected.”
