  The Birds Don’t Sing [from new album Let God Sort Em Out] is an incredibly
  emotional track, especially for an album opener. What things did your parents
  say to you that make you proud and have stuck with you over the years? Fran_M
  Malice: Creating that song was a very emotional time and it cut real deep, but
  to be able to journal the grief from losing both our parents into a piece of
  art was also healing. I believe it’s a song that is going to resonate with a
  lot of people, because whether we like it or not, most of us are going to end
  up outliving our parents. This is something always in the back of your mind,
  you know? Already, a lot of people are coming up to us on the street and
  saying: thank you, that song helped me to grieve. The Birds Don’t Sing isn’t
  just our story, it’s everybody’s story. Pusha T: In hindsight I believe my mom
  was leaving breadcrumbs and doing all these little things in order to let us
  know she didn’t have long left. She was mapping, planning and vocalising
  specific things before she passed away. It was her way of saying goodbye, you
  know? It was super important to detail all of that, because it gave me and my
  brother a sense of peace. Malice: No doubt. In terms of specific things our
  parents said? Well, you know, my dad always instilled in us the idea that
  honesty is the best policy! That you have to go through life being as truthful
  as possible and to always try to show integrity in your character. I remember
  mom was always big on us truly being brothers and looking out for one another,
  no matter what. That advice still resonates to this day and with the energy of
  this album. How did you guys develop your signature diction and wit as
  writers? MaximFlath Pusha T: To me the most gangster shit in the world is when
  you’re having a really cutting conversation and looking directly into
  someone’s eyes. To be able to embody a coldness without being over the top.
  Like Tony Soprano might smack somebody up, but the most gangster part is when
  he’s just lucidly speaking to his therapist, you know? My rapping style is a
  lot like that. Thomas Hobbs: What about horror? Because you often sound like a
  horror bogeyman when you are rapping. Pusha T: I always liked the energy of
  the old horror movies. Like The Omen and The Exorcist, where a lot of it is
  based on these eerie conversations and they didn’t need special effects [to
  scare you]. TH: Would you say coming from a musical household was a big part
  of shaping your style as well? Malice: Remember the movie Crooklyn by Spike
  Lee? The scene where all the brothers and sisters are watching Soul Train and
  American Bandstand? That was the perfect depiction of how musical our
  household was. By the time we moved to Virginia, I told my mom I wanted a
  microphone, a beat machine, a turntable, a Gemini mixer with the reverb on it.
  My mom literally forced my dad to buy it all for me, because he was much more
  dismissive at first and said things like: “Why do you need all that? Rap ain’t
  even gonna be here for that long, son!” Music was always a big part of our
  upbringing. If I just think about our house then the living room was filled
  with hundreds of vinyl records from all genres. That was the foundation. You
  know that I recently found all those records and got them back? Pusha T: No, I
  didn’t know that. Malice: It was literally tons of vinyl. Look: if my parents
  would argue, someone would go downstairs and put a record on full volume to
  drown out the noise. Music was always the backdrop and there tended to be
  cousins dancing in our house. Malice, you are a man of God and so am I; I’m a
  woman, actually. I love hip-hop, but sometimes the lyrics, imagery and
  messaging feels so spiritually off. How do you navigate that as a Christian?
  LoveFromLagos Malice: The gospel tells us about the war between the spirit and
  the flesh. It talks about these constant contradictions, and how helpless we
  all are as long as we are in this flesh. The flesh and the spirit are always
  at enmity with one another. So, we are all walking contradictions, right? The
  thing about morality is that you’re only good until you’re not. It’s not
  supposed to be a juggling act: we all try to do the right thing, but there’s
  going to be circumstances where we fall short. There is part of the scripture
  from the apostle Paul, who says: “For I do not do the good I want to do, but
  the evil I do not want to do – this I keep on doing. Who will rescue me from
  this body of death?” It shows that we are all sinners and we all fall short.
  That’s what being human is all about. And Pusha, you’ve been very candid about
  how things ended with Kanye’s GOOD Music label. While I understand you went
  through a lot of challenges, can you mention some of the good times?
  LovefromLagos Pusha T: Just as a rap aficionado, well, being there was
  special! Creating So Appalled and New God Flow were some of my favourite
  memories. The Good Friday series, that was crazy, too. The albums I dropped
  during that time, like Daytona and It’s Almost Dry, they are very, very strong
  offerings. It goes without saying that me and Ye made great things together.
  Do you think there’ll ever be another collab between you and Ye? Joooooooj
  Pusha T: Yeah, that’s in the past. That’s definitely in the past. TH: But if
  one of your rap enemies ever apologised, could you let it go? Pusha T: I’m not
  mad at anybody. I’m good. I’m happy. But at the same time I don’t know if I
  necessarily want to work with those people either. I’m cool with how all of
  this has played out. If I diss someone it’s a very real thing to me. Like I
  watch rappers uses disses as a gimmick and shit like that, but that ain’t what
  it is for me. There is always a lot of humour and brilliant scene setting in
  your lyrics. Have you ever thought about writing a screenplay? Hhhhssss
  Malice: Writing a screenplay for a Clipse biopic movie is a must. A lot of
  people would like to see that film. Right now, we’re seeing rappers fall to
  the federal government or they’re losing their lives because of drug
  addictions and out-of-control egos. But there’s a lot to learn from our lives,
  especially the way me and my brother have navigated the pitfalls of the
  business and always tried to make the best possible decisions. Who had the
  best verse on Let God Sort Em Out? Bezosofthenasals Pusha T: I don’t know if I
  have a personal favourite verse on the album to be honest, maybe it’s my Ace
  Trumpets verse. I wish I had rapped what Malice said on Mike Tyson Blow to the
  Face: “Only 300 bricks can make you Leonidas.” Pusha, I think I saw you
  performing with Kelis when she supported U2 in 2001. What was your experience
  of those shows? Sharmadelica Pusha T: U2 were so fucking cool, man! I remember
  it was a super big deal to be touring with them at that time, and it was one
  of my first real experiences on a big stage. For U2, tour life is about
  five-star catering; runners who will go grab you whatever you ask for; and
  random vans that will take you anywhere in the city. These dudes had
  manicures, pedicures, massages! Touring with U2 seriously fucked up my
  expectations, bro. Because when you go out and tour for real as a rapper, the
  reality can be a very gruelling thing. Malice: Wait, hold up, can I share my
  own Bono interaction? I met him backstage around the time I converted from
  Malice to No Malice and found God. I remember Bono said to me: “You have this
  righteous anger now and you have to go do something with it!” That always
  stuck with me. It kind of gave me the green light, and what Bono said is
  always in the back of my mind around not abandoning my convictions. Bono is a
  good dude. What are each of your favourite albums of all time? Fionnmck
  Malice: Listen, I love the Killers, I love Red Hot Chili Peppers, even Billy
  Joel! When I work out in the gym, I have Coldplay playing, or U2’s The Joshua
  Tree. It’s funny, because when I watched MTV back in the 1980s, David Bowie
  was always on there. All these years later and Bowie is still at the forefront
  today. I think that says something about true talent and how it can carry on
  through the ages. It even outlasts your death. Pusha T: I’m always torn
  between Mobb Deep’s The Infamous, Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Jay-Z’s
  Reasonable Doubt, and Biggie’s Life After Death. I can drive anywhere in the
  world with those four albums and I will be happy. Have you watched much
  British TV/film? If so, what have you liked and why? Jajones7 Pusha T: [Loud
  laughter] Definitely Benny Hill! Benny was running around with women on late
  night TV! My older brother was always watching him, laughing, and I would
  sneak in. And what’s my other man called … um, Rowan Atkinson? Mr Bean, right?
  That dude was ill. Do you still write your rhymes? If so, do you prefer
  handwritten, typing on the phone, or both? Do you have any particular rituals
  when writing or recording? Wzrdwthwrzf Malice: For me it’s about building a
  verse line-by-line throughout the day. It might start off in the shower,
  continue while I am driving, and then when I get to the studio I put it all
  together. It is always pen and paper with a pristine notebook. If I mess up on
  the writing, I am gonna rip out the page and start over. Pusha T: I can only
  write things down to be honest, because I am a very visual person. I don’t
  know how to do the whole spontaneous freestyle thing, because I am always
  second guessing myself. I am a perfectionist and so that involves editing a
  lot. I might come up with a good bar, but I will keep going back to it and
  working out how to make it fresher. What can we expect from the duo in the
  future? Is this the end? CClarke2005 Pusha T: We’ve definitely got more music
  in store, baby. Malice: [Laughs knowingly] Nah, we got it. We’ve definitely
  got it! • Let Got Sort Em Out is out now on Roc Nation. Clipse’s US tour
  continues until 10 September. They play the O2 Kentish Town Forum, London, on
  9, 12 and 13 November and the O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, on 10
  November • This article was updated on Thursday 7 August to correct a
  misattributed quote, and to further clarify details of the conversation.
