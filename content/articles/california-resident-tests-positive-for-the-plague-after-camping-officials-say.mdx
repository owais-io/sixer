  A resident of South Lake Tahoe in California has tested positive for the
  plague, local authorities announced this week. A statement released on Tuesday
  by health officials in El Dorado county said they were notified of the
  situation by the California department of public health (CDPH). The statement
  said the individual is now recovering at home and is under the care of a
  medical professional. Health officials believe that the person “may have been
  bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area”, a
  popular recreation spot in the California mountains, and said that they are
  investigating the situation. “Plague is naturally present in many parts of
  California, including higher-elevation areas of El Dorado county,” said Kyle
  Fliflet, El Dorado county’s acting director of public health. “It’s important
  that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors,
  especially while walking, hiking and/or camping in areas where wild rodents
  are present.” According to the news release, plague is caused by the bacterium
  Yersinia pestis, and is most often transmitted by the bites of fleas “that
  have acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks and other wild
  rodents”. Dogs and cats can also carry infected fleas into the home, officials
  said. In the statement, local officials advised the public to avoid contact
  with wild rodents and to prevent pets from going near rodent burrows. The news
  release said that while human cases of plague are “extremely rare”, they can
  be very serious. Symptoms typically appear within two weeks of exposure and
  include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, the release noted. If
  detected early, plague can be effectively treated with antibiotics. CDPH said
  that it routinely monitors rodent populations across California for plague
  activity. The department said that surveillance in El Dorado county from 2021
  through 2024 identified a total of 41 rodents that showed evidence of exposure
  to the plague bacterium. So far in 2025, four rodents have tested positive,
  county officials said, adding that they were all within the Tahoe Basin. This
  week’s case is not the region’s first brush with plague. The last confirmed
  human case in El Dorado county was in 2020, the statement added, and was also
  believed to be linked to the South Lake Tahoe area. Before that, the release
  says that two cases were reported in 2015 after exposure in Yosemite national
  park. All individuals were treated and recovered. In 2021, the US Forest
  Service announced it was closing several popular sites at Lake Tahoe for
  several days after discovering plague in the chipmunk population. The federal
  agency said at the time that “vector control” workers would complete
  “eradication treatments” in the area. Last year, Colorado health officials
  also confirmed a human case of the plague. The Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention estimates that there is an average of seven human plague cases a
  year in the US, with most of the human cases occurring in the western US.
