  As the worshippers streamed into the vast Grand Mosalla mosque in central
  Tehran to hear a call to prayer, the mood was one of determination, and some
  trepidation, as they faced the real prospect of UN sanctions in 30 days and
  even a rerun of the 12-day war with Israel. With guards watching, a worshipper
  giving his name simply as Mousavi said: “The reality is that many countries
  have nuclear power and are not subject to these rules but Iran is singled out
  for controls because we oppose Israel. We are dealt with in a different way
  because of our foreign policy. “But an economic avalanche is looming with
  these UN sanctions – they are very different from what has happened before –
  and that means even more economic adversity will only impoverish us more. So I
  think we have to relent a little. We have to let the UN inspectors in. There
  is probably not much nuclear material for them to see.” But that is far from
  the universal view, reflecting the politics of a mosque associated with
  hardliners and closely involved in the burial ceremonies of the previous
  president Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash that some
  Iranians still insist was not caused by bad weather but by sabotage by the
  Mossad. Rajabi Seddequi, also fatalistic as he headed across the boiling and
  dusty car park towards the mosque, said: “For 40 years we have become familiar
  with sanctions. They did not break us. They made us more resilient. Life has
  gone on. It does not bother us whether they are UN or US sanctions. If we have
  to choose between war and the entry of the UN inspectors, we will choose war.
  We will protect Iran and Islam.” A third worshipper, Ibrahim Heshmati, smiled
  as he insisted: “If there is a second war, this time it will be all the way to
  Israel. We stopped too early last time and we have the missiles to do this.
  “How can we trust a country like the US since we were in the middle of
  negotiations when they allowed Israel to attack us? If they did not claim we
  were making nuclear weapons they would find another pretext,” he added. “If
  there is a war we have to face the consequences. This is both a war of
  religion and war between states. We have nothing to fear.” Akbar Babaye, a
  veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, remembered: “Iran was alone before, facing US
  Awacs, French Mirage jets, T-72 tanks from Russia. We had 22 countries against
  us and alone we won. “Every government has underestimated our resilience. We
  are not going to back down. Next time Israel is going to be completely
  destroyed. A third of the population of 90 million are ready to go to war, and
  we are not afraid of death because when we die we will go to heaven because we
  are oppressed by the oppressors. The Israelis will not.” In Qom, Hashem
  Hosseini Bushehri, the Friday prayer leader, denounced Israeli oppression at
  length. He said: “We too must stand against Israel’s crimes with initiative
  and resistance, just like the people of Yemen, so that life in Gaza can
  continue.” The sentiments expressed show how hard domestically it will be for
  a divided Iranian government to make the kind of concessions the European
  governments are demanding. Radicals in the parliament are planning to table
  new laws calling for Iran to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation
  treaty, but that decision in practice may be the prerogative of the supreme
  leader, and would lead to a massive internal political battle about the
  direction of Iran. Iran has been in a state of neither war nor peace since the
  12-day war ended with a ceasefire that left the Iranian nuclear programme
  largely destroyed. Europe has given notice that it will snap back the
  sanctions unless the UN nuclear inspectorate is readmitted to all of Iran’s
  nuclear sites, and not just those that were not attacked by Israel. Tehran has
  said it is willing to negotiate the modalities of the inspector’s return, but
  western diplomats, confident they have the legal and political base to act,
  say they have been given nothing substantive about how these inspections will
  work in practice. The Iranian foreign ministry insisted the European powers
  had no legal basis to act. The European diplomats believe Iran fears
  independent confirmation that its 30-year nuclear programme has been destroyed
  by Israeli bombing, which could prompt a backlash from a population angry at
  the sacrifice of withstanding sanctions for no purpose. Iranian diplomats say
  they will spell out their likely reprisals if the UK, France and Germany press
  ahead with reimposing sanctions. Separately, behind closed doors, at the UN
  headquarters in New York, the UK and French delegations were briefing fellow
  diplomats about how the unprecedented snapback procedure would work. Some
  politicians say the impact of the sanctions will be limited since they were
  foreseen. Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer and Nobel peace prize winner, wrote on
  Instagram that the consequences of sanctions will be “far more dangerous than
  war” for Iran. She predicted the value of the national currency would fall
  even further, infrastructure would fail, poverty would increase, and social
  crises would spread, adding that the Islamic republic was the main culprit of
  this situation. Iran is also debating the impact of the return of the sanction
  resolutions that do not directly target Iran’s oil, gas and petrochemical
  industries or even banks and financial institutions. Most of these resolutions
  impose restrictions in the military and nuclear industries, especially on the
  buying and selling of weapons, and call on governments to exercise greater
  oversight and monitoring of Iran’s transactions and shipments to prevent their
  use in developing Iran’s nuclear and missile industries. In a wider political
  change, if the sanctions are reinstated Iran will be recognised as a country
  violating international laws and subject to chapter seven of the UN charter.
  Iran’s entire nuclear programme will be declared illegal.
