  Morning everyone. We continue our Descendants series today with a report from
  Bootenal Springs in Western Australia about how the families of Indigenous
  people and white settlers came together for a reckoning about a massacre 171
  years ago – and calls for the release of diaries that could shed light on
  colonial-era killings. Plus: we examine claims and counter-claims about the
  size of the Sydney pro-Palestine march, we have plenty on an extraordinary
  game of cricket in England – and will it all go wrong for Sydney Sweeney now
  that she’s been outed as a Republican? Australia Glacial change | Glaciers on
  a remote Australian sub-Antarctic island are shrinking rapidly, losing almost
  a quarter of their size in just 70 years, with researchers fearing glaciers on
  a neighbouring peninsula may have already disappeared. The Descendants | The
  descendants of those who committed a massacre at Bootenal Springs near
  Geraldton in Western Australia – the wealthy Drummond and Criddle families –
  and the surviving Naaguja have come together to reckon with this bloody
  history. Guardian Australia sat down with both sides as part of The
  Descendants project. Plus: Naaguja traditional owners have called for the
  diaries of the prominent colonist Major Logue to be published in full, after
  we revealed that coded entries from the diary in the 1850s described the
  killing of Naaguja Yamatji people. Bridge divide | The police estimated the
  crowd at the Harbour Bridge protest to be 90,000 but Palestine Action Group
  say the figure was closer to 300,000. Who was right? Airport chaos |
  Passengers were evacuated from Brisbane domestic airport and flights delayed
  after a fault with a single metal detector prompted travellers and staff to be
  re-screened by security. App appeal | Giggle for Girls and Sall Grover have
  begun their appeal to overturn a landmark court decision that found the
  women-only social media app and its boss had unlawfully discriminated against
  Roxanne Tickle, a transgender woman. World Israeli pushback | Hundreds of
  former Israeli security officials, including previous heads of the Mossad and
  the military, have signed an open letter to Donald Trump urging him to
  pressure the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to end the war in
  Gaza. A UN expert who warned of the starvation crisis last year says “no one
  should act surprised” about the calamity. US visitor bonds | The US state
  department has prepared plans to impose bonds as high as US$15,000 for some
  tourism and business visas, according to a draft of a temporary final rule.
  Elsewhere in the Magaverse, Marjorie Taylor Greene has told an interviewer
  that she feels the Republican party has lost touch with its base. And Donald
  Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will arrive in Moscow for talks with
  Vladimir Putin tomorrow. Activist arrested | The far-right activist known as
  Tommy Robinson has been arrested by British police on suspicion of grievous
  bodily harm after a man was allegedly assaulted at a London railway station
  Musk gets richer | Tesla’s board has approved the award of $US29bn worth of
  shares to its chief executive, Elon Musk, after a US court ruled against a
  previous pay deal for the world’s richest person. Sydney sider | We write a
  fair bit about the politics of Sydney, but the politics of Sydney Sweeney are
  causing a big stir after the ubiquitous actor was revealed as a registered
  Republican. Full Story Is Australia a conspiracy-theory nation? Conspiracy
  theories and fringe ideas are now increasingly a visible part of Australian
  politics and public life. But what pushes people to abandon our shared
  reality, and what is responsible for the rapid rise in false truths? Reged
  Ahmad talks to Ariel Bogle and Cam Wilson about the threat conspiracy theories
  pose to Australia. In-depth Business owners in Bali are in despair about the
  destruction of 48 cliffside establishments at Bingin beach. The dispute
  symbolises the struggle between mass tourism and the desire to retain the
  island’s special appeal. Not the news What’s your favourite Sam Neill
  performance? Is it The Dish? Is it Dead Calm? Or is it even his turn in Peaky
  Blinders? Luke Buckmaster gets it sorted. Sport Cricket | Ben Stokes has
  praised his England players despite India completing one of the most dramatic
  Test match victories ever seen at the Oval, squaring the series with a
  stunning six-run victory after Chris Woakes attempted to carry his team over
  the line with a dislocated shoulder. Our writer Barney Ronay captures the
  game’s “moments of beauty, fun and impossible drama”. Formula One | After
  Oscar Piastri missed out on winning the Hungarian grand prix, our
  correspondent assesses the season so far as the teams take their mid-season
  break. Rugby league | The Penrith Panthers have defended the actions of
  trainer Corey Bocking after the NRL proposed huge penalties for a
  controversial incident at the climax of Saturday’s clash against the Gold
  Coast. Media roundup Ten Victorian towns are going to lose piped gas because
  the operator says it’s too expensive, the Age reports. Forecasting Australia’s
  weather has become harder thanks to Donald Trump, according to Matt Kean
  writing in the Sydney Morning Herald. The Daily Telegraph dissects the NRL’s
  “trainer-gate” and what it calls one of the league’s most significant
  sanctions in recent history. What’s happening today Economy | Car sales
  figures for July at 11am followed by ABS release on monthly household
  spending. Courts | Bakers Delight v Fair Work Commission in the federal court.
  Fashion | Country to Couture fashion collections from Indigenous designers.
