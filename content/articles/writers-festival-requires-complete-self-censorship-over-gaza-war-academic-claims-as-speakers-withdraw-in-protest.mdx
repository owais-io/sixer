  A number of authors and academics have withdrawn from this weekend’s Bendigo
  writers’ festival over a speaker code that one says requires “complete
  self-censorship” over Israel’s war in Gaza. Academic and author Dr Randa
  Abdel-Fattah, First Nations poet Dr Evelyn Araluen and Wiradjuri writer and
  poet Jeanine Leane are among those who have withdrawn from the festival over
  the code. Prof Clare Wright, a guest curator at the festival and Latrobe
  University academic, has also withdrawn for personal and professional reasons
  which include the code, a source told Guardian Australia. Author Kate
  Mildenhall, who was due to moderate a festival session, said she was not sent
  the code of conduct but has since become aware of it. “In solidarity with the
  other writers who are withdrawing and also because of my own personal beliefs
  about the ideas of censorship I felt I was unable to continue with my
  participation in the writers festival,” she said. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email The festival’s code, viewed by Guardian Australia, says speakers should
  uphold respectful engagements which involves avoiding language or topics that
  “could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”. A source told
  Guardian Australia Bendigo writers’ festival (BWF) sent some speakers the code
  of conduct on Wednesday – two days before the opening day. The code says that
  for “La Trobe Presents” panels, speakers must comply with the principles
  espoused in La Trobe University’s anti-racism plan, including the plan’s
  definitions of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Abdel-Fattah, a Macquarie
  University academic, said she could not appear at the festival “as a
  Palestinian”. “The actual wording of [the speaker code and La Trobe policy]
  requires me to engage in complete self-censorship, so, such as a profound act
  of gaslighting,” she said. La Trobe’s 2025-2030 plan adopts University
  Australia’s antisemitism definition. The adoption of a sector-wide definition
  earlier this year emerged as a key recommendation of a report on antisemitism
  on Australian university campuses, which found there was an “urgent need for
  reform” to ensure the safety of Jewish students and staff. The definition
  states that antisemitism is: “discrimination, prejudice, harassment,
  exclusion, vilification, intimidation or violence that impedes Jews’ ability
  to participate as equals in educational, political, religious, cultural,
  economic or social life”. It states that criticism of the policies and
  practices of the Israeli government or state is “not in and of itself
  antisemitic”, but further reads: “Criticism of Israel can be antisemitic when
  it is grounded in harmful tropes, stereotypes or assumptions and when it calls
  for the elimination of the State of Israel or all Jews or when it holds Jewish
  individuals or communities responsible for Israel’s actions …” Some academics
  at Australian universities have warned the definition could have a “chilling”
  effect and limit the scope of what can be taught on the Middle East.
  Abdel-Fattah said La Trobe’s anti-racism plan makes no mention of
  anti-Palestinian racism. It includes a definition of Islamophobia –
  discrimination that may be racial, religious or cultural in nature and is
  defined as an irrational fear, hatred or prejudice of Islam, Muslims, Islamic
  traditions and practices, and those who appear to be Muslim. Abdel-Fattah said
  her new novel, Discipline, is centred on the story of a Palestinian author and
  journalist. “The book is all about how their voices are repressed and censored
  and how their voices are managed through the language of policies, through the
  language of civility and politeness and not offending others,” she said. La
  Trobe University is one of the festival’s partners. Wright was a guest curator
  of the festival’s La Trobe Presents panels. Araluen, a Goorie and Koori poet,
  said she hoped audiences would reconsider whether they wanted to attend a
  festival that has made it impossible for people to speak openly about their
  work, experiences or perspectives. “It’s really important to make sure that
  the art sector is not divorced from law and from policy and from morality,”
  she said. “You can’t place this form of censorship on artists and writers when
  we’re being told to discuss things like First Nations languages and the
  history of political representation of Aboriginal people, as is the event that
  I was programmed to speak on.” A La Trobe University spokesperson said they
  acknowledged the decision of those writers who had withdrawn. The spokesperson
  said the university was committed to ensuring events it sponsors are “safe,
  inclusive and equitable for all members of our community”. La Trobe said it
  expects the Bendigo writers’ festival to have measures in place to ensure
  respectful exchange of views as well as community safety. “Codes of conduct
  are not unusual at writers’ festivals,” the spokesperson said. “La Trobe
  University does not tolerate racism of any kind, including antisemitism and
  Islamophobia, and has adopted the Universities Australia definition of
  antisemitism, along with all other Australian universities. “La Trobe’s
  approach to combatting racism is consistent with our commitment to academic
  freedom and freedom of speech.” Jess Hill, a journalist and educator on
  coercive control, said she believed the primary reason for the code was to
  stop “people from criticising Israel, and making political statements about
  the genocide in Gaza.” “I’ve never seen a festival send out a dot-pointed code
  of conduct that restricts freedom of speech. That is an incredible thing to
  send to authors taking part in a festival of ideas,” she said. “It also sets a
  really terrible precedent. Most importantly though, the code of conduct is a
  divisive directive that has clearly made the festival untenable for
  Palestinian speakers and Palestinian allies.” The program of the two-day
  festival in regional Victoria says it includes events featuring 80 writers and
  speakers. A spokesperson for the Bendigo writers’ festival said it was
  “committed to holding an event that engages in respectful debate, open minded
  discussion, and explores topical and complex issues.” “The Festival and
  Presenting Partner, La Trobe University, felt it was necessary to emphasise
  the importance of safety and wellbeing for all participants by introducing a
  Code of Conduct,” the spokesperson said. “Codes of Conduct are part of similar
  festivals and are a useful reference point to guide expectations for
  respectful discussion, particularly when exploring past and current
  challenging, distressing and traumatic world events.” The spokesperson
  acknowledged it would need to make some changes to the programme and said the
  festival respected the decision of participants who chose to withdraw over the
  conduct.
