  How do we judge whether one tax is better than another? That question will lie
  at the heart of the tax reform agenda at the economic reform roundtable on
  Thursday. Four principles have guided tax reform over the decades: efficiency,
  equity, simplicity and sustainability (or revenue adequacy). All are
  important. But with productivity growth the name of the game, let’s focus on
  the first: efficiency. Stephen Bartos, a professor of economics at the
  University of Canberra and a former deputy secretary at the Department of
  Finance, says taxes inevitably affect behaviour – but “some taxes are a lot
  better for the economy than others”. When it comes to efficiency, a core
  concept is to design a tax system as simple as possible to not discourage
  productive activities such as work and investing. Chris Murphy, an honorary
  senior lecturer at the Australian National University, has for decades been a
  central figure in modelling the impact of tax reform, including the
  introduction of the GST and the landmark Henry tax review. Calculating the
  burden of a tax Murphy has updated his estimates of various taxes’ “marginal
  excess burden” – the additional economic cost of a tax beyond the revenue
  raised. His modelling suggests raising the rate of the GST imposes an
  additional 30c cost to the economy for every dollar raised. Broadening it, he
  says, comes with a marginal excess burden of 13c. That makes the GST more
  efficient than personal income taxes (a 48c loss of economic welfare for every
  $1 of revenue raised) and company taxes (65c). Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Speaking at the National Press Club this week, Danielle Wood, the chair of the
  Productivity Commission, explained that “generally, anything that switches out
  higher cost, higher economic-drag taxes for lower cost, more efficient taxes
  will give you a productivity dividend”. “Equally, anything that broadens the
  base of a tax, which winds back concessions but then reduces the rate, will
  give you an economic kicker.” The ‘worst’ taxes Four of the five least
  efficient taxes are at state and territory level. This makes it difficult to
  coordinate shifts away from more damaging but highly lucrative taxes. The
  “worst” taxes on Murphy’s measure are the land tax on investment properties
  (92c of economic damage for every $1 in revenue raised), followed by stamp
  duties on the purchase of homes (74c) and taxes on insurance (69c). Wood said
  it was “very clear” from modelling that “stamp duties stand out as kind of
  exceptionally economically damaging taxes”. When experts talk about switching
  from inefficient stamp duties to a land tax, they are talking about a broad
  land tax that applies to all homeowners. Murphy says a broad land tax is
  equivalent to municipal rates – which, as the analysis shows, is a very
  efficient tax (a 4c offset in extra economic welfare per dollar of revenue
  raised). State pain for national gain Efforts to transition to a more stable
  and less distortionary land tax have proved a step too far for even the most
  willing of state leaders. That’s why any commonwealth-led discussion on tax
  reform has to include the states and territories, Bartos says. “The only way
  to get the states on side is if you compensate them,” he says. “Probably the
  only way to do that is to increase the GST rate or broaden its base” to
  include excluded items such as fresh food, education and health services.
  “Broadening the GST would have the added benefit of simplifying the system.”
  Luke Yeaman, the Commonwealth Bank’s chief economist and a former Treasury
  deputy secretary, says there is theoretically a strong case for using
  increased GST revenue to pay for income tax relief – a switch that has wide
  support among many experts. But cash-strapped states were unlikely to want to
  make this deal with the commonwealth. “If you want lower income taxes, you’d
  have to do some other broader deal with the states, for example, around health
  funding or education funding, where you agree to provide less on the health
  and education side, and they claim the extra GST revenue,” he says. “I think
  that proves very difficult at the moment in a world where the states are
  cash-constrained.” Yeaman agrees there could, however, be scope to use any
  increase in GST revenue to pay for states to get rid of inefficient taxes such
  as stamp duties. Royalties v rents While state-level mining royalties schemes
  are lucrative for governments such as Queensland, Murphy’s analysis shows they
  are much more inefficient than federal mining “rent” taxes, which target
  excess profits. The petroleum resource rent tax, for example, has an
  offsetting 8c for the economy for every dollar raised. That’s in part because
  foreign owners of the gas companies pay the tax, Murphy says. Bartos explains
  that “the problem with royalties is basically you are taxing production, and
  so that acts as a direct disincentive”. “A rent tax taxes super profits over
  and above normal profits, and in that sense they don’t distort production at
  all. That makes them a much better form of tax.” Tax income less and wealth
  more Bartos’ high level verdict on Australia’s broad tax settings echoes the
  expert consensus: “Australia’s tax system is weighted too heavily to taxing
  income and not wealth. “That encourages people to salt away wealth in
  unproductive things.” Labor is already chipping away at overly generous tax
  concessions for Australians with more than $3m in superannuation. But it has
  balked, at least so far, at suggestions for trimming tax breaks for
  residential property investors, which also overwhelmingly favour the rich.
  “Sadly, the least likely to be on the agenda is inheritance taxes,” Bartos
  says. “That doesn’t distort behaviour – people are not going to put off dying
  because they have to pay tax. “And it actually is a very efficient tax to levy
  and Australia is really unusual to be one of the few countries to not have
  some form of inheritance tax. It is very much a political no-no in Australia.”
