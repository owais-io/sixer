  The Guardian view on Israel’s Gaza takeover plan: a destructive act that must
  be stopped | Editorial
sectionName: Opinion

bodyText: >-
  Israel’s planned takeover of Gaza would be an act of destructive futility. It
  would solve absolutely nothing. It will merely pile fresh military,
  humanitarian and political problems on to the mounds of those already created
  in the conflict. It will make every human agony worse, not better. Governments
  around the world must do whatever they can – the US above all – to stop it.
  There is still time. The plan announced on Friday is for an operation to take
  military control of Gaza City, home to a million displaced Palestinians. They
  will be forcibly evacuated, yet again, to the southern Gaza Strip over the
  coming weeks. Aid distribution is certain to be a secondary consideration,
  logistically challenging and woefully inadequate for a population where
  malnutrition is already severe. The threat to life in Gaza, including to the
  remaining Israeli hostages captured on 7 October 2023, will get much worse.
  Friday’s announcement leaves open the question of whether the operation will
  be extended later to the entire Gaza Strip. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin
  Netanyahu, has said this is his wish. The current decision to limit the
  takeover seems to reflect objections from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chiefs.
  But there is no guarantee that an even larger takeover will not then follow.
  Mr Netanyahu always ratchets up. The sum of his choices amounts to perpetual
  war. This is a strategy that ensures, for the moment, that Mr Netanyahu
  remains in power. But it does not ensure a military victory. It escalates the
  fight with Hamas without any way of ending it. Twenty months of attacks may
  have devastated Hamas, but the capacity to mount a limited insurgency remains.
  Such insurgencies are hard to defeat, as the US found in Vietnam and Iraq, and
  Britain learned in its former empire and in Northern Ireland. “Everybody is
  going to be in this meat grinder,” a senior Israeli former soldier graphically
  told the BBC this week. The misery will be felt in Israel too. The plan could
  be a death sentence for the 20 or so living hostages. It could also guarantee
  that the bodies of about 30 believed dead will disappear for ever. Mr
  Netanyahu’s decision, in effect, to put punishing Hamas above the freeing of
  Israeli hostages will agonise their families and deepen domestic political
  divisions. The strain on Israeli society is already intense, with IDF chiefs
  opposing the Gaza takeover and arguing unsuccessfully for more targeted
  operations. Now more Israeli soldiers will die too. The takeover shows how
  cavalierly Mr Netanyahu is willing to deepen Israel’s political isolation as
  long as he has Washington’s support. Other foreign governments have condemned
  the plan. Britain said it was simply “wrong” and “will only bring more
  bloodshed”. Germany, Israel’s second largest military supplier, put a ban on
  weapons for use in Gaza, a significant move. In realpolitik terms, however,
  everything comes down to the US. President Trump should condemn the takeover
  plan and match the German stance. US allies should insist that he does so.
  Hamas’s allies must be pressured too. Mr Netanyahu’s approach is not merely
  wrong. It will make things worse, much worse for people in Gaza in the short
  term most of all, but worse for Israelis in the long term too. His policy is
  exactly the kind of historic folly so well described by the historian Barbara
  Tuchman as “a perverse persistence in a policy demonstrably unworkable or
  counter-productive”. Mr Netanyahu is sowing dragon’s teeth for years to come,
  and the sooner he is stopped the better. Do you have an opinion on the issues
