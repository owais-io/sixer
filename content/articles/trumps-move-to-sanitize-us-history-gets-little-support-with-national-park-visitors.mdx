  As part of his administration’s war on “woke”, Donald Trump has asked the
  American public to report anything “negative” about Americans in US national
  parks. But the public has largely refused to support a world view without
  inconvenient historical facts, comments submitted from national parks and seen
  by the Guardian show. Notices have been erected at every National Park Service
  (NPS) site, which spans 433 national parks, monuments and battlefields,
  following an order from May entitled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American
  History”, issued by Trump’s department of the interior. The president had
  demanded a crackdown on any material that “inappropriately disparages
  Americans”. The signs ask visitors to report any damage to parks as well as,
  via QR code, to identify “any signs or other information that are negative
  about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty,
  grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features”. But a trove
  of nearly 500 comments relating to the signs submitted across the US by the
  public in June and July, seen by the Guardian, show that visitors have mostly
  been reluctant to demand the removal of park materials about the darker
  chapters of America’s past, such as slavery or the mistreatment of Native
  tribes. “Are we such weak, fragile people that we can’t view the full length
  and breadth of our history?” one visitor to Muir Woods in California wrote in
  July after a sign called “history under construction” was taken down. “Are we
  so afraid that we have to hide factual history from the telling of our past?
  Oh, please!!” Another visitor to Cumberland Gap national historical park in
  Kentucky wrote in June that “the staff that work at this park are among the
  kindest, most knowledgeable people you will find anywhere”. They added: “I
  hate that this administration feels that history that may depict the United
  States in a bad light should be covered up.” Many of the comments praise park
  rangers or call for more information on issues such as the Indigenous American
  experience or the climate crisis. Some complain about the decision to remove
  the ‘T’ from LGBT at New York’s Stonewall national monument, to exclude
  transgender people, while some visitors demanded the unvarnished truth be told
  at Manzanar, a California facility where Japanese-Americans were interned
  during the second world war. “Sanitizing or downplaying this history does a
  disservice to those who lived through it,” one Manzanar tourist wrote.
  “Whoever authorized this sign should be fired,” added another visitor about
  the new signage. “History belongs to all people, and any attempt to rewrite or
  gloss over even our darkest days should not be tolerated.” The QR code
  comments, a snapshot of public opinions that are filtered before being stored
  by the NPS, come at a tumultuous time for the park service. Nearly a quarter
  of NPS staff have departed the agency since Trump became president, leading to
  overstretched and potentially dangerous conditions at storied sites often
  referred to as “America’s best idea”, such as Yellowstone, the Everglades and
  the Statue of Liberty. “Americans have demonstrated they have a deep love
  affair with national parks and what we’ve seen from these comments is that the
  public has said this is an insulting and misguided effort,” said John Garder,
  a senior director at the National Parks Conservation Association. “Rangers
  shouldn’t be intimidated to not talk about slavery and other things that have
  happened in America’s past. It’s outrageous and the American public have been
  deeply disturbed by it.” However, not all of the submitted comments from what
  some park staff call “snitch signs” will be used to direct the revamp of park
  signage. Of the comments seen by the Guardian, fewer than 40 were ‘flagged for
  review’ by the park service and of those, fewer than 10 were indicated to be
  definitely used as part of the response to the interior department order. This
  small selection of comments mostly aligns with the administration’s
  perspective. One complains about “revisionist history based in woke religion”
  at Muir Woods, another criticizes “fashionable leftist jargon” and a third,
  from a visitor to Washington’s Rock Creek park, is upset that materials on
  Francis Newlands, a US senator around the time of the first world war,
  “disparage him as a white supremacist for holding what were common views at
  the time”. “They want this virtue-washed version of history and they are
  trying to drive a wedge between us and the public,” said one senior NPS
  employee, who did not want to be named for fear for retribution. “Every time
  there is a comment asking for more information on Indigenous people, it won’t
  be acknowledged. If there’s someone who says they are terribly offended by a
  sign, it will be flagged and sent for review.” The NPS staffer, part of the
  “resistance rangers” movement within the park service comprising more than
  1,000 off-duty rangers that has its own podcast in which they contribute
  anonymously, said that the composition of comments has recently become more
  pro-Trump since the park service noticed the public were mostly supportive of
  signs. “It seems like an orchestrated effort was made, a lot of the comments
  appear the same or AI-generated,” said the employee. The Guardian has seen no
  evidence that the public responses have been distorted by the administration
  in this way. “Overwhelmingly, we have a positive response from the public
  every day. People don’t want this. Every day I have people whisper to me, ‘we
  love the parks, we want to help.’” The administration is expected to act soon
  to take down signs it deems inappropriate. On Monday, it began a separate
  month-long process to review and remove other materials in national park
  sites, such as books and posters found in gift shops. “We have to review every
  single pamphlet, pin and magnet,” said one NPS employee. “There are going to
  be hundreds of items that are going to be removed.” A superintendent of a
  history-based park said there has been very little guidance on how to judge
  materials as problematic. “It’s on the park staff, who are already
  underresourced, to figure out what to censor, which is really troubling,” they
  said. “I’ve tried to not delegate any of this because I don’t want to make
  staff do things that go against their values,” the superintendent said of the
  signs. “This is a way to stop us talking about difficult topics and tie our
  hands behind our backs. Overwhelmingly, the public aren’t buying it. They
  don’t want this. When the department set this up I don’t think they expected
  so many of the comments to be positive, it backfired a bit on them.” The purge
  is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to bend American
  historical, cultural and scientific life to fit its ideological imperatives.
  Military bases and statues will again bear the name of Confederate generals,
  climate science reports will be re-edited to potentially include discredited,
  fringe views while current and planned exhibitions at the Smithsonian
  Institution, the world’s largest museum and research complex, will be reviewed
  to “assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals”. An
  NPS spokesperson said by 18 September signs found to be “inconsistent” with
  the Department of Interior order would be removed, covered up or reinstated at
  a later date. “The National Park Service has received several substantive
  comments to date from across the country complimenting park programs or
  services, noting maintenance issues, or flagging potential inaccuracies or
  distortions of information out of context,” the spokesperson said. “In
  implementing the order, the goal is to foster honest, respectful storytelling
  that educates visitors while honoring the complexity of our nation’s shared
  journey and park staff are only sent actionable comments related to that
  goal.”
