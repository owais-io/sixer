  The biggest battery on Australia’s energy grid is now on standby as a shock
  absorber to prevent blackouts in New South Wales. The Waratah Super Battery
  will also allow NSW to use and transmit more energy, applying further downward
  pressure on electricity prices, experts say. The battery, built on the site of
  the former Munmorah coal-fired power station on the Central Coast, has added
  350MW of battery capacity to the energy grid since plugging in last September.
  Waratah’s backstop system was brought online on Friday, making it the largest
  energy system integrity protection scheme (SIPS) in the country. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, said the battery
  was a crucial addition to state infrastructure. “As it comes online, it will
  help power our homes and businesses while stabilising the grid to avoid
  blackouts,” she said. In the event of blackout risks or power surges from
  bushfires, lightning strikes or other disruptions, the battery would activate
  as a shock absorber and steady the state’s energy supply, Ahmad Ebadi, a
  senior project manager at Transgrid, said. “[The battery system] monitors 36
  transmission lines in real time across NSW, detects overloading and responds
  in seconds … to increase generation,” he said. More power could be transmitted
  and used across NSW once the battery’s full capacity of 850MW comes online;
  that is expected by the end of 2025. Operating at full capacity, the battery
  would ease the urgency of building more energy transmission, said Dylan
  McConnell, an energy systems researcher at UNSW. “By increasing the
  utilisation of your existing transmission network, you can actually reduce the
  need to build more transmission in the future,” he said. “Ideally, it [means]
  lower electricity prices in the long run.” An agreement with the NSW
  government will mean the battery reserves 700MW of its capacity for the
  system-protecting service during the day in summer. Waratah can store and
  discharge energy like other big battery projects. The project was one of 12
  battery systems to enter the national energy market in the year to June – more
  than doubling grid-scale battery discharge, the Australian Energy Market
  Operator (Aemo) reported in July. Investment in big batteries has accelerated
  in 2025. More projects are under construction, including one at Eraring, the
  site of the nation’s biggest coal-fired power station, and another at former
  coal plant Liddell. The NSW government in 2024 extended Eraring’s operations
  to 2027 after Aemo in 2024 warned its retirement would increase blackout
  risks. More coal-fired power stations are scheduled to retire in coming years.
  Anna Freeman, acting chief policy and impact officer at the Clean Energy
  Council, said the Waratah battery would help reduce the state’s reliance on
  coal. “[It] is capable of holding as much energy as half an Eraring coal-fired
  power station and plays a pivotal role in ensuring that NSW can push ahead
  with confidence to a future powered by renewables,” she said. Tim Buckley, the
  director of Climate Energy Finance, said the battery’s delivery could help
  bring energy prices down by supporting more green energy projects to
  completion. “It will [help] more wind and solar and firming capacity into the
  grid, all of which means we will see electricity prices stabilise and then
  progressively, hopefully come down over time,” he said.
