  Another MasterChef contestant has been edited out of the latest series after
  the controversy over the conduct of its sacked presenters, raising further
  questions about the BBC’s decision to broadcast the show. Banijay, the
  production company behind the cooking contest, confirmed to the BBC that a
  second contestant had asked to be edited out of the programme. It comes two
  weeks after the Guardian revealed that Sarah Shafi had agreed to be removed
  from the show, having said that it should not be aired. She said that after
  allegations were made against Gregg Wallace and John Torode its broadcast
  would send the wrong message about the treatment of women and inappropriate
  behaviour by prominent figures. Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an
  independent report substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including
  claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical
  contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused” but said the report
  cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”. Torode was also
  dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated
  complaint over the use of racist language, which he believes never happened. A
  spokesperson for Banijay said: “One other contributor decided that given
  recent events they would like not to be included. We have of course accepted
  their wishes and edited them out of the show.” The series, which began airing
  last week, was filmed before Wallace and Torode were sacked. The BBC claimed
  it was “the right thing” to broadcast it, for the amateur chefs that took
  part. It had already been forced to edit the programme to reduce the
  prominence of Wallace and Torode and remove Shafi’s appearance. It has now
  been edited further to remove another contestant, who has asked not to be
  identified, according to the BBC. The BBC is facing fresh criticism on social
  media about its decision to broadcast the series amid speculation about
  whether it would continue if more contestants asked to be removed. In a
  statement last month, the BBC said: “This has not been an easy decision in the
  circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. In showing
  the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of
  the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been
  very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at
  the BBC or on shows made for the BBC. “However, we believe that broadcasting
  this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to
  the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the
  choice to watch the series.”
