  Spirits were high in May after what may turn out to be the last night of
  A-League football at Ironbark Fields, when a Noah Botić hat-trick against
  Adelaide sent Western United to the semi-finals. There had been financial
  concerns swirling in the months preceding, but in the post-match function
  among sponsors and friends the club’s chair Jason Sourasis appeared
  untroubled. The former AFL player agent and dealmaker is known to be
  personable, and he was at his attentive best as he entertained the
  Sydney-based mother of his star striker with a promise of flights down to
  Melbourne for the following week’s semi-final. At that moment, the club he
  helped conceive appeared to have a future. Investment by a US-based group had
  just been announced, and Western United were chasing a second A-League Men’s
  title. Sourasis’ star striker was on the verge of a Socceroos call-up. Yet
  from the moment the lights went out in Tarneit that night, the outlook for
  Western United has soured. Within days, the club was bundled out of the
  A-League Men championship race by crosstown rivals Melbourne City and Botić
  moved at the end of his contract to play in Austria. The takeover by the
  prospective owners has stalled, and Western United – a club that promised a
  new vision for football in Australia, with a dedicated football stadium and
  their own suburb nestled in a growth corridor – is within days of collapse.
  Rewind seven years and Western United represented hope. They had been chosen,
  alongside Macarthur, in an expansion process run by Football Australia as the
  A-League looked to rekindle growth ahead of the decoupling of the club
  competition from the national governing body. The bid involved more than a
  football club. Melbourne’s west was growing, and Wyndham City Council found an
  ideal partner in the A-League aspirants. The club would provide an anchor for
  a phased development on the western fringe of Tarneit to help build land
  values in the area, and would oversee construction including residential and
  commercial real estate as well as the jewel of the bid, a football-dedicated
  15,000-seat stadium. Former Socceroo and Western United director Steve Horvat
  described the ground as a “game-changer” when former FA chief executive David
  Gallop announced the new franchise in 2018. The timing was awkward, given it
  came in the days before the A-Leagues were granted independence. But FA
  awarded the licence in consultation with other clubs, and few would argue it
  was in error. Sports stars like Scott Pendlebury and Jack Ziebell, contacts
  from Sourasis’ time working in AFL football, as well as tennis player Thanasi
  Kokkinakis and basketballers Dante Exum and Chris Goulding, came on as
  investors to lend the project legitimacy and startup capital. So while the
  club was at that stage literally an empty paddock, the choice was made with
  the long-term in mind. Covid saw to that. Midway through the club’s first
  season – during which Western United reached the men’s semi-finals and once
  drew more than 10,000 fans to Geelong – the virus shut down Victoria and
  suffocated the state for the next two years. Investment crucial for
  development of the precinct and stadium dried up, and the club has struggled
  to build momentum in the years since. Under new coach John Aloisi, its 2022
  A-League Men’s championship was an on-field triumph, but not enough cared.
  Attendances dropped the following season, and the club was barely drawing
  3,000 to each home match during a financial year in which the club lost $12m.
  Documents lodged with Asic in July revealed liabilities exceeded assets by
  $55m. Fifa has banned the club from registering players due to unpaid wages,
  and former midfielder Riku Danzaki raised during court proceedings this month
  that late payments were one consideration in his decision to chase a windfall
  by betting on himself accruing yellow cards. The vulnerability for the club
  has always been to see through the uncertainty – and limited cash reserves –
  of the short-term with a focus on the long-term vision, but some creditors
  have run out of patience. Lawyers will appear in court on Thursday at the
  latest hearing as part of a winding up process initiated by the tax office. It
  also involves the Victorian state revenue office, the local distributor of kit
  supplier Kappa and a marketing agency. The court has previously heard the
  creditors seek in excess of $10m, and there is little evidence the mooted
  investors will be able to deliver the reported $100m investment that will
  clear the club’s debts. The most this group, known as KAM Melbourne, has paid
  so far as part of the deal announced with much fanfare in May is $1,500. A
  Football Australia regulatory process has already stripped Western United of
  their licence to play matches two weeks ago. The outcome of the club’s appeal
  of this decision is due at the end of this week, conveniently after the court
  hearing, however the club has a right to appeal again to the Court of
  Arbitration for Sport (CAS). If the KAM Melbourne deal never eventuates, there
  will be implications for many cascading from what will soon come. The APL is
  currently working on a backup draw in case the coming season – due to start in
  two months – won’t feature Western United. What the rest of the year looks
  like if the club takes the licensing decision all the way to CAS is not clear.
  The future of the public-private partnership with Wyndham City Council is up
  in the air. The council has been forward in making it known that the land on
  which Ironbark Fields sits remains in council’s hands. But they have
  commissioned former state minister Justin Madden to prepare a report by the
  end of September on how to handle the situation, and the council is “deeply
  committed to this unique initiative”, according to Wyndham corporate services
  director Mark Rossiter. Western United’s players are also in limbo. Their
  senior professionals may struggle to find another club with such a short
  turnaround, and the collapse of the club’s junior pathways will interrupt the
  development of many. Then there are the club’s fans. Western United’s Facebook
  page was updated with a post of photos of players in pre-season training last
  week, captioned simply “building”. The responses were quick: “Building what?”
  “A stadium?” “I wish people would keep their negative comments to themselves,”
  another replied. “If you were a supporter you wouldn’t think this was a joke.
  Some of us are trying very hard to stay positive and want to hang on to the
  club we love.”
