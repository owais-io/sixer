  In his popular BBC series Just One Thing, the late Michael Mosley made the
  case for resistance training. Lifting weights, he explained, not only builds
  stronger muscles, it also boosts the immune system, maintains a healthy heart
  and improves brain function. Best of all, it can be done in your kitchen,
  using ordinary domestic items: pints of milk in place of dumbbells, say, or
  squats wearing a backpack full of books. Anyone intending to use Robert
  Galbraith’s Strike novels for this purpose would be advised to seek the advice
  of a GP. The Hallmarked Man may not be the heftiest of the eight so far – it
  does not even make it into the top three – but it still clocks in at a cool
  912 pages. Galbraith’s tendency to whopperdom has in the past elicited a fair
  amount of griping from critics, me among them, who argued that judicious
  pruning would better serve her plots and her charismatic private detective
  duo, the sweary one-legged army veteran Cormoran Strike and his brave, decent
  business partner Robin Ellacott. Not that it changed anything. The books
  remained resolutely huge (as did sales – by 2024, a staggering 20 million
  books had been sold in over 50 countries). Galbraith, otherwise known as JK
  Rowling, has never been one to bow to her detractors. My arms may plead
  otherwise, but this time she may have a point. The Hallmarked Man gets off to
  a spankingly brisk start and from then on seldom lets up. A grotesquely
  butchered corpse is found in the vault of a silver shop in the City of London.
  The police claim the body is that of armed robber Jason Knowles, but not
  everyone accepts their conclusions, including Decima Mullins, who, convinced
  that the dead man is instead the vanished father of her newborn child,
  approaches Strike to help her prove it. Sceptical, Strike and Ellacott
  reluctantly take on the case, but, as they study the evidence, the plot only
  thickens. The silver shop, located next to Freemasons’ Hall, specialises in
  masonic artefacts: among his other mutilations, the dead man’s body has been
  cut with a masonic hallmark. There are other missing men whose descriptions
  could match that of the corpse. Before long, Strike and Ellacott find
  themselves puzzling over not just one potential murder but four. As always
  with Galbraith, the personal lives of the detectives play as pivotal a role in
  the story as the increasingly labyrinthine mystery. Strike’s endless and
  endlessly tantalising will they/won’t they two-step with Ellacott is
  jeopardised by her deepening relationship with CID officer Ryan Murphy,
  himself caught up in a difficult case. Talented but manipulative
  ex-Metropolitan police officer Kim Cochran has joined the agency and seems set
  on stirring things up. And if all that was not enough to be getting along
  with, Mullins turns out to have close family connections with Charlotte
  Campbell-Ross, Strike’s dead former fiancee. The result is a terrific and
  tightly plotted romp with none of the longueurs that padded previous volumes.
  With an apparent effortlessness that speaks of great discipline and skill,
  Galbraith keeps the plates of all four possible murder inquiries spinning,
  each one replete with its own satisfyingly unexpected feints and twists. With
  so much going on, it is occasionally a challenge to keep track of who exactly
  has done what and why, but Galbraith’s sure-footedness is such that it hardly
  matters: the desire to leaf back and check a point feels considerably less
  urgent than the compulsion to find out what will happen next. The propulsive
  drive of the story is matched by the sheer enjoyment of the ride. Previous
  Strike novels have proved something of a battleground for the often toxic
  cultural and political wars that Galbraith/Rowling has engaged in on the
  public stage – transphobia and online mob justice in The Ink Black Heart, cult
  indoctrination in The Running Grave. But, despite the appearance of a
  gloriously awful ex-Tory MP who sprinkles his conversation with Latin tags and
  goes on political quiz shows, The Hallmarked Man is not a novel with a
  manifesto. For all its fiendish cat’s cradle of a plot, it foregrounds the
  personal, reminding us yet again what thoroughly good company Strike and
  Ellacott are. It is no small feat to keep readers invested in a relationship
  that has been on the breathless brink of almost consummation for seven (giant)
  books. But Galbraith pulls it off with aplomb, deepening our affection for
  this engaging, exasperating should-be couple as Strike promises himself (and
  us) that this time he will finally tell Ellacott how he feels … Some of
  Galbraith’s more irritating quirks do surface, most distractingly the
  insistence on clumsy phonetic dialogue of the “I fink ’e said … didn’ ’e say
  ’e knew” variety. And little is gained by detailing every drink order in every
  pub. But these are quibbles. The Hallmarked Man is a triumph of storytelling.
  Sheer weight aside, I’m pretty sure it improved my cognitive function. It also
  touched my heart. • The Hallmarked Man by Robert Galbraith is published by
