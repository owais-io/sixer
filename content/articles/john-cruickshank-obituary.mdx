  John Cruickshank, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving combatant to
  have won the Victoria Cross during the second world war, and the last living
  Scottish recipient of what is one of the most distinguished awards for
  gallantry in the world. At the start of the war Cruickshank was an apprenticed
  clerk with the Commercial Bank of Scotland. As a member of the Territorial
  Army he initially served with the Royal Artillery, transferring into the RAF
  as a trainee pilot in June 1941. By July 1944 he was with 210 Squadron in
  Shetland, flying anti-submarine patrols in Catalina flying boats. On 17 July
  1944, Flying Officer Cruickshank took off from RAF Sullom Voe in Shetland as
  the pilot and “boat skipper” of the 10-man crew of RAF Catalina JV928. They
  were tasked to help protect a Royal Navy carrier group of three aircraft
  carriers and 17 warships as it made its way home from northern Norway
  following a failed attack on the German battleship Tirpitz, which was wreaking
  havoc among allied convoys ferrying supplies to the Soviet Union. Cruickshank
  was by then one of the squadron’s most experienced pilots, having flown 47
  sorties searching for German U-boats, albeit fruitlessly. The British were
  able to intercept and decipher the locations of the submarines, but even so,
  he and his crew had only ever found one, and they had failed to sink it. They
  had been on patrol for eight hours and were just about to turn for home when
  the radar picked up a potential target 43 miles away. They homed in on it and
  found a submarine travelling on the surface. Cruickshank initially thought it
  was a friendly boat and had his crew fire a recognition signal flare while
  flashing the code letter of the day. The swift response was a barrage of
  exploding anti-aircraft shells. Cruickshank flew out of the line of fire and
  then swooped down to 50ft to drop the depth charges that would break up the
  submarine and sink it. As he manoeuvred the Catalina into position to drop the
  charges his crew fired an intense burst of rounds at the U-boat’s gunners. But
  when John “Dickie” Dixon, the navigator and bomb-aimer, pressed the release
  button, the depth charges remained in place. A furious Cruickshank yelled at
  Dixon, telling him in no uncertain terms to fix the problem fast. “I felt
  considerable anger,” he later recalled. “However, one can’t allow one’s anger
  and surprise to continue for very long and one has to decide what’s going to
  happen next.” Determined not to let a second U-boat get away, Cruickshank
  climbed away and prepared to come in for another attack. As the Catalina swept
  through, it came under intense fire from the U-boat’s guns. “The flak was
  considerably more accurate this time,” one of the Catalina’s crew recalled.
  “There was a wall of black anti-aircraft fire bursting in front of us, and
  Cruickshank just flew the plane straight through it.” The anti-aircraft rounds
  ripped a number of holes in the Catalina’s aluminium skin, killing Dixon, and
  shrapnel hit Cruickshank in the chest, penetrating his lungs. He was
  subsequently found to have suffered 72 wounds. But he kept going, this time
  releasing the depth charges himself and having the satisfaction of achieving a
  perfect “straddle”. The U-boat, later discovered to have been the U-361, broke
  up in the water and sank with the loss of all crew. The Catalina was very
  badly damaged and there was serious doubt as to whether it could make the
  six-hour flight back to Sullom Voe. The crew put out the fires and plugged the
  holes with life-jackets and other pieces of gear but they had no radio, one of
  the fuel tanks was leaking and there was a gaping hole in the fuselage just
  below the waterline. Despite his wounds, Cruickshank set a course for home and
  remained at the controls until on the verge of collapse when he finally let
  the second pilot, Jack Garnett, take over. He was taken to the back of the
  plane to have his wounds treated, but despite the pain refused morphine
  because it would affect his ability to take back control of the aircraft.
  Cruickshank was falling in and out of consciousness due to loss of blood and,
  according to his citation, “able to breathe only with the greatest
  difficulty”, but an hour before they reached base he insisted that the crew
  take him back to the cockpit and place him in the second pilot’s seat so he
  could advise the inexperienced Garnett on how to land the badly damaged
  aircraft. Garnett had never landed a plane in the dark, so when they reached
  Sullom Voe, Cruickshank told him to circle above the base and ordered his crew
  to lighten the aircraft by jettisoning anything they could. As dawn broke, he
  guided Garnett down towards the sea’s surface then grabbed the controls
  himself to make the actual landing, before taxi-ing swiftly towards the beach
  with water pouring in through the hole in the fuselage. “It was in everybody’s
  interest that I should be helping Jack to land the aircraft,” Cruickshank
  later said. “It was better to make a safe landing, whatever the effect on my
  own life.” Cruickshank was given an emergency blood transfusion at the base’s
  medical station and taken to hospital, where he remained on the critical list
  for 10 days. After two months’ treatment and recuperation he was well enough
  to receive the VC from King George VI at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. As a
  result of the injuries suffered in the attack on the U-361, Cruickshank never
  flew again. He was promoted to flight lieutenant and posted to HQ Coastal
  Command at Northwood in Middlesex for the rest of the war. Cruickshank was
  born in Macduff, Banffshire (now Aberdeenshire), the son of James, a civil
  engineer, and his wife, Alice (nee Bow). He was educated at Aberdeen grammar
  school, the Royal high school, Edinburgh, and Daniel Stewart’s college (also
  in Edinburgh, now Stewart’s Melville college). He left the RAF in 1946 to take
  up a post as aide-de-camp to the lord high commissioner to the general
  assembly of the Church of Scotland. He joined Grindlays Bank in 1952,
  developing business in Africa and Asia, and from 1977 he was an administrator
  for North West Securities, until his retirement in 1985. He married Marion
  Beverley, a Canadian from Toronto, in 1955. She died in 1985. • John Alexander
