  League Two: The points have been shared at Rodney Parade in a match between
  Newport County and Notts County that kicked off an hour later than shceduled
  due to a pre-match medical emergency in the stands. Gerard Garner opened the
  scoring for the hosts, only to have his effort cancelled out by a Jodi Jones
  penalty after 65 minutes. League One best and worst Promotion favourites
  Huddersfield got their campaign off to a flier under rookie manager Lee Grant
  by beating Leyton Orient 3-0, with £1.2m summer signing Alfie May scoring his
  first goal for the club from the penalty spot. Signed from Kilmarnock during
  the summer, Fraser Murray scored twice on his debut in Wigan’s 3-1 win over
  Kevin Nolan’s Northampton Town. Newly promoted Bradford got their League One
  campaign off to the best possible start, beating Wycombe 2-1 in front of a
  crowd of over 20,000 fans at Valley Parade. Tom Cleverley endured a miserable
  start to his stint as Plymouth Argyle manager, picking up a yellow card for
  dissent as his side flattered to deceive in the second half of their defeat at
  the hands of Conor Hourihane’s Barnsley. And Nigel Clough tasted defeat in the
  first Nigel Clough Derby of the season, as his Mansfield Town side ran out 2-1
  losers against his former side Burton Albion. League Two: Newport County’s
  match against Notts County didn’t kick off until 4pm due to a pre-match
  medical emergency in the stands at Rodney Parade that required an air
  ambulance to land on the pitch. It is now well under way and it’s 1-1 between
  the two sides after a Jodi Jones penalty for Notts County in the 65th minute
  cancelled out Gerard Garner’s opener for the hosts. Some housekeeping: In my
  post timestamped 16.27, I revealed that Barnsley’s Jack Shepherd had been sent
  off wasn’t entirely sure why. Well, it turns out that the defender was booked
  for a handball outside his own penalty area and, oblivious to the fact that
  Shepherd was already on a yellow card, the referee took no further action
  after showing him his second one. About 30 seconds later, he remembered (or
  was reminded) that Shepherd had already been booked earlier in the game and
  returned to the scene of his most recent crime to show the Barnsley player the
  obligatory, if slightly tardy red card. And breathe. Well, the new EFL season
  is well and truly up and running and it could be argued that the best result
  of the day has been secured by Lee Grant’s Huddersfield Town. The former
  goalkeeper and rookie manager, who was taking his first ever game in charge,
  will be delighted with his massively revamped side’s 3-0 demolition of Leyton
  Orient, a victory in which £1.2m signing Alfie May opened his account for a
  side who are among the favourites to top the third tier comes season’s end.

  Northampton Town League One: Huddersfield Town wrap up their win against
  Leyton Orient with a late, late goal from Dutch defender Ruben Roosken. The
  Terriers are 3-0 ahead with just seconds remaining. Scottish Premiership:
  Livingston will leave Rugby Park delighted with the result of their first
  match upon their return to the Scottish top flight. They’ve come from two
  goals down to sgare the points with hosts Kilmarnock. League Two: Ian
  Holloway’s Swindon Town look set for some opening day heartbreak after 10-man
  Walsall go 2-1 up courtesy of what looks like a Connor Barrett winner in added
  time. It’s 2-1 at the Bescot. League Two: It’s scoreless at half-time in the
  delayed kick-off between Newport County and Notts County. Scottish
  Premiership: Livingston’s equaliser survives a long, long VAR check and it’s
  2-2 deep in added time of their match against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. League
  One: Niall Ennis takes advantage of a defensive mix-up to score Blackpool’s
  second goal and make it 2-3 in their game against Stevenage. At Home Park,
  Plymouth’s chances of snatching a draw look dashed after David Keillor-Dunn
  took advantage of a shambles at the back to make it 3-1 to Barnsley. At the
  Eco-Power Stadium, Doncaster Rovers’ Luke Molyneux scores from the spot to put
  his side 1-0 ahead against Exeter City. Scottish Premiership: Back in the top
  flight after winning promotion, Livingston have come from two goals down to
  equalise at Kilmarnock but Scott Pitman’s strike is currently the subject of a
  lengthy VAR check. League Two: Will Wright scores from the spot to get Swindon
  Town back on level terms against Walsall at the Bescot Stadium. At
  Accrington’s Wham Stadium, Devon Matthews has put the boom-boom back into the
  hearts of travelling Gillingham fans by scoring an own goal at a corner to
  make it all square between the sides at 1-1 with 11 minutes of normal time
  remaining. League One: Bailey Cargill nods home a far post header from close
  range to get Mansfield Town back into their game against Burton Albion, who
  had been in total control of this Nigel Clough derby but now only lead 2-1.
  League One: Rotherham’s Zak Jules has been sent off for his second bookable
  offence at the New York Stadium. His side are still 2-1 up against Port Vale,
  who are also a man down. Scottish Premiership: Robbie Muirhead has made a game
  of it at Rugby Park, pulling a goal back for Livingston, who trail host
  Kilmarnock 2-1. League One: Daniel Udoh pulls a goal back for Wycombe against
  Bradford, who still lead 2-1 at Valley Parade. League Two: Grimsby go 3-0 up
  against Crawley Town thanks to an Evan Khouri goal on 64 minutes, while
  Stephen Duke-McKenna has given Harrogate a 1-0 lead over Bristol Rovers
  courtesy of a goal that had more than a whiff of offside about it. League One:
  Rereco Hackett doubles Lincoln’s lead against Reading, while Michael Forbes
  has started Northampton’s revival against Wigan with a far post header from
  close range. The Cobblers trail 3-1. League One: Barnsley lead Plymouth 2-1
  but are down to 10 men following the dismissal of defender Jack Shepherd for –
  I think – dissent, or possibly in a case of mistaken identity after a handball
  by one of his teammates. More news as I get it but Shepherd has walked …
  Transfer news: Middlesbrough midfielder Hayden Hackney has rejected an
  approach from Ipswich Town despite the two clubs agreeing a £20m fee for his
  transfer. League One: Connor Hall pulls a goal back for newly promoted, 10-man
  Port Vale, who now trail Rotherham by the odd goal in three at the New York
  Stadium. League One: Brought in from Birmingham City after helping their
  promotion push last season, Alfie May repays some of his transfer fee by
  scoring his first goal for Lee Grant’s Huddersfield Town from the spot to put
  his new side 2-0 ahead against Leyton Orient. League Two: In good news for my
  firend and colleague the Guardian Football Weekly podcast presenter Max
  Rushden, Louis Appere has put Cambridge United a goal ahead against Cheltenham
  Town at the Abbey Stadium. League One: Playing in goal for Blackpool, Bailey
  Peacock-Farrell gifts possession to Stevenage with a dismal clearance and
  seconds later has to pick the ball out of the net after Dan Kemp had slotted
  home to put the visitors 3-1 up at Bloomfield Road. League One: Charlie
  Webster scores his second eye-catching goal of the afternoon to notch up the
  first double of his career and give Burton Albion a 2-0 lead against Mansfield
  Town at the Pirelli Stadium. Following on from his splendid first-half volley,
  this was a dipping shot from distance that found its way into the bottom
  corner. League One: Caleb Watts chests down a pass and stabs the ball past
  Barnsley goalkeeper Murphy Cooper from close range to halve Plymouth’s deficit
  against the team from Oakwell. League Two: Elliott Bonds spanks a shot past
  Owen Evans from about 14 yards to double Fleetwoood’s lead against Barnet.
  League One: I can confirm that Fraser Murray has never played in goal for
  Rangers but a cursory bit of research reveals he has played in midfield for
  both Hibernian and Kilmarnock, who he was playing for as recently as last
  season. His curled strike from just inside the penalty area took a wicked
  deflection on its way past Northampton goalkeeper Lee Burge. League One: A bad
  afternoon for Kevin Nolan has just got worse after his Northampton side
  conceded their third goal without reply to Wigan. Fraser Murray, who with a
  name like that sounds like he should be playing in goal for Rangers, extends
  Wigan’s lead at the Brick Community Stadium. Those first halves: I was rather
  hoping for a gentle reintroduction to the occasional chaos that is the
  Guardian’s Saturday clockwatch but the goals have been flying in courtesy of
  all these restless players who are clearly champing at the bit after their
  summer holidays in Ibiza. Of course a few of them, specifically Barnet’s
  goalkeeper, Owen Evans, have been playing like they’re still on the
  sun-lounger with their noses buried in the latest John Grisham novel. Anyway,
  it’s good to be back! A late goal for Stevenage: I’m afraid I jumped the gun
  there and got caught out! Stevenage went 2-1 up against Blackpool courtesy of
  a Jamie Reid penalty in the 10th minute of six minutes of allocated added
  time. I’ve amended the previous entry accordingly. Cardiff City 2-1
  Peterborough (R) Blackpool 1-2 Stevenage Bradford City 2-0 Wycombe Burton 1-0
  Mansfield Town Doncaster Rovers 0-0 Exeter Huddersfield Town 1-0 Leyton Orient
  Lincoln City 1-0 Reading Plymouth Argyle 0-2 Barnsley Rotherham United 2-0
  Port vale Wigan 2-0 Northampton Town Accrington Stanley 0-0 Gillingham Barnet
  0-1 Fleetwood Town Bristol Rovers 0-0 Harrogate Town Cambridge United 0-0
  Cheltenham Chesterfield 1-0 Barrow Colchester 0-1 Tranmere Rovers Grimsby Town
  2-0 Crawley Town MK Dons 0-0 Oldham Athletic Newport County v Notts County
  (kick-off delayed) Salford City 1-1 Crewe Shrewsbury Town 0-0 Bromley Walsall
  1-0 Swindon Town League Two: Conor Thomas strikes again, firing Crewe 3-1 up
  against Salford City in the third minute of time added on at the end of the
  first half. Salford City owner Gary Neville will not be impressed, although
  one suspects his friend and co-owner David Beckham won’t be scaling quite the
  same levels of umbrage. League Two: Conor Thomas restores Crewe’s lead over
  Salford City, putting them 2-1 ahead against Karl Robinson’s side. League One:
  Wigan double their lead against Kevin Nolan’s Northampton Town, going 2-0 up
  thanks to a near-post header at a corner from Jensen Weir. Scottish
  Premiership: Kilmarnock increase their lead at the top of the Scottish
  Premiership, doubling their lead against Livingston through David Watson.
  Scottish Premiership: Kilmarnock score the first goal of the Premiership
  season, taking the lead against newly promoted Livingston courtesy of a
  Djenario Daniels dink. League Two: Newport County have now put kick-off in
  their game against Notts County at Rodney Parade back to 4pm, due to a
  pre-match medical emergency involving a fan that required the summoning of an
  air ambulance that landed on the pitch. Here’s hoping the supporter in
  question is OK. League One: Port Vale’s return to League One under Darren
  Moore could scarcely be going more badly. Already two down against Rotherham
  to a Sam Nombe brace, they’ve just lost Jaheim Headley to a red card for a
  high challenge on the goalscorer. League One: Sam Nombe rockets straight to
  the top of the League One goalscorers charts after scoring his second of the
  game for Rotherham, who lead Port Vale 2-0. At Home Park, Plymouth have
  coneded their second of the game without reply to Barnsley, conceding a
  beautifully struck Adam Phillips volley from outside the penalty area. League
  Two: Barnet goalkeeper Owen Evans dawdles on the ball and gifts possession to
  Fleetwood’s Will Davies, who is only too happy to advance on the empty goal
  and give his side a 1-0 lead. League Two: Walsall are now a goal up and a man
  down against Swindon Town after losing Brandon Conley to a red card for
  hand-tripping a rival player who had beaten him for pace. League One: Burton
  lead Mansfield Town 1-0 in a Nigel Clough derby that isn’t currently going
  Nigel Clough’s side’s way. The former Burton Albion manager is back at
  Mansfield Town for his second spell in charge. League One: The goals continue
  to fly in as Bradford City double their lead against Wycombe Wanderers. Bobby
  Pointon with the second goal at Valley Parade. Meanwhile at the LNER Stadium,
  Lincoln City have gone ahead against Reading courtersy of a decidedly
  unfortunate own goal from finley Burns, who was powerless to avoid deflecting
  a cross past his own goalkeeper. League One: With an excellent finish from a
  very tight angle, Jamie Reid cancels out George Honeyman’s opener for
  Blackpool to restore parity for Stevenage. League Two: Kadeem Harris has
  redeeed himself by cancelling out his own goal by equalising for Salford City
  against Crewe Alexandra. League One: Rotherham United have taken the lead
  against newly promoted Port Vale after Sam Nombe got on the end of a long ball
  from deep to volley home a fine effort from distance. At Home Park, Plymouth
  midfielder Brendan Sarpong-Wiredu has marked his debut for the club by
  shinning a Barnsley free-kick into his own net at the back post. Oops. League
  Two: Ian Holloway’s Swindon Town trail at Walsall after Evan Weir put the home
  side a goal up. Meanwhile at the Peninsula, Salford City have gone a goal down
  against Crewe after Kadeem Harris put the ball into his own net. At Blundell
  Park, Grimsby have gone ahead against Crawley thanks to Jaze Kabia’s penalty
  on 10 minutes, while kick-off in the game between Newport County and Notts
  County has been delaeyd until 3.45pm. League One: Antoni Sarcevic fires
  Bradford ahead against Wycombe in front of 20,000 fans at Valley Parade.
  League One: Signed from Millwall this summer, George Honeyman slots home to
  give Steve Bruce’s Blackpool the lead over Stevenage after six minutes.
  Meanwhile at the Accu Stadium, home side Huddersfield have gone a goal up
  against Leyton Orient courtesy of a scruffy effort that went in off Joe Low’s
  shoulder from close range. League One: Plymouth Argyle, who are being managed
  by Tom Cleverley, thought they’d opened the scoring against Barnsley courtesy
  of a Caleb Watts strike from eight yards but his effort has been disallowed.
  Transfer watch: I’ve just discovered that my compatriot the Rep of Ireland
  striker Aaron Connolly plays for Leyton Orient and has lined up with the Os to
  face Huddersfield Town today. The last I heard, Connolly was at Millwall. Our
  three o’clock kick-offs are go. Well, most of them are. We’ve yet to hear if
  the game between Newport County and Notts County at Rodney Parade was able to
  get under way after an air ambulance had to land on the pitch earlier so its
  occupants could attend to a fan who fell ill in the stands. Not long now: It’s
  the hope that kills you and all over the UK, fans of teams in Leagues One and
  Two are brimful of optimism ahead of today’s three o’clock kick-offs as their
  teams prepare for their first games of the season. While your team can’t win
  the league on the opening day of the season, they can certainly give fans a
  fairly good idea of which end of the table they’ll be battling on the last
  day! Sheffield Wednesday: In some rare good news during desperate times for
  Sheffield Wednesday fans, club captain Barry Bannan has signed a new contract
  with the troubled Championship club. The 35-year-old midfielder, who had
  attracted interest from Millwall and Middlesbrough after his previous deal
  expired, has committed to the Sheffield Wednesday at the end of a week in
  which the club failed to pay their players and other staff on time for the
  third successive month. The club has not disclosed the details of Bannan’s new
  deal. “This club is a big part of me and my family, who are with me here today
  as I’m signing,” said Bannan. “They will always stand by me with whatever
  decision I make and I’ve decided to stay. With the season getting closer, this
  last week has been tough because there was interest from elsewhere and I had a
  lot to think about. We had a lot of conversations as a family and when I told
  my daughter Elsie that I might be leaving she started crying. Then last night
  when I told her I was staying she started crying again. I asked her why and
  she said they are just happy tears.” Bannan has made a total of 447
  appearances for the Owls, placing him eighth on the club’s all-time list. his
  new deal comes two days after it was revealed players and staff had refused to
  take part in a scheduled behind-closed-doors friendly against Burnley
  scheduled for today. That game was cancelled amid an escalating financial
  crisis at Hillsborough under owner Dejphon Chansiri and caused growing concern
  within the English Football League over whether the club will be able to play
  their opening game of the season at Leicester on 10 August. Wednesday have
  been placed under several EFL embargoes for breaching financial rules. They
  currently have only 16 senior players contracted to the club following the
  departures of Djeidi Gassama, Anthony Musaba, Josh Windass and Michael Smith.
  The latter two had their contracts terminated by mutual consent to allow them
  to join Wrexham and Preston. The latest missed payments to players and staff
  in July heaped further pressure on Chansiri, who insists he is willing to sell
  the club for the right price. He recently revealed he had rejected one
  consortium’s £40million bid, while talks with various other interested parties
  have stalled. Newport County: The League Two club have announced on social
  media that the kick-off for their game against Notts County is “likely” to be
  delayed after a fan took ill in the stands, prompting an air ambulance to land
  on the pitch at Rodney Parade. “We send our very best wishes to the individual
  concerned,” wrote the club on X. League One: Cardiff City have got their third
  tier campaign off to a winning start, coming from behind to beat Peterborough
  United in the Welsh capital. Rubin Colwill cancelled out Bradley Ihionvien’s
  first-half penalty with as good a free-kick as you’re ever likely to see at
  this or any other level, before teenage right-back Ronan Kpakio won the game
  for Cardiff with the first senior goal of his fledgling career. Premier League
  transfer news: Callum Wilson has decided the famous West Ham striker hoodoo is
  nothing to be worried about and has agreed a deal to join Graham Potter’s
  squad on a free transfer after leaving Newcastle United in June. Wilson, 33,
  will sign a one-year deal with the London club. Interview: In a predictably
  entertaining and at times poignant sit-down, veteran manager Neil Warnock
  recalls the time Crystal Palace’s data boffins stopped him from signing a
  young Virgil van Dijk for £4m after arriving at the deranged conclusion the
  Dutchman was “not quick enough”, discusses his unlikely bromances with Pep
  Guardiola and Arsene Wenger, and looks forward to seeing his name up in lights
  outside the London Palladium in September. Words: Donald McRae. National
  League: Forest Green owner Dale Vince is one of the partners in an initiative
  where GPs can prescribe a day out watching his National League team as an
  alternative to antidepressants. And while the jokes obviously write
  themselves, it seems like a very good idea before a ball has been kicked in
  the current campaign. Eze Obasi reports … Newport County: David Hughes has a
  wealth of coaching experience at the highest level but is enjoying his first
  real tilt at frontline management in his new role as head coach of Newport
  County, who have one of the tiniest budgets in League Two. Interview: Ben
  Fisher. League One preview: Luton look the team to beat after back-to-back
  relegations and Stockport County have shown plenty of ambition in the transfer
  market, while Darren Moore’s Port Vale will be hoping to stave off the drop
  following their promotion last season. Will Unwin casts an eye over the
  runners and riders in the third tier … League Two preview: MK Dons are many
  pundits’ idea of likely winners under Paul Warne and Bristol Rovers will be
  hoping theirs is a short stay in the fourth tier, while another difficult
  season awaits Accrington. Will Unwin gazes into his his crystal ball … League
  One: Ronan Kpakio, Cardiff City’s 18-year-old right-back, has just swept home
  his first ever senior goal to give his side the lead in the Welsh capital. It
  was a fine effort from some distance which came at the end of a good Cardiff
  move down the left. Scottish Premiership: There are two Scottish Premiership
  fixtures today, with Kilmarnock and Livingston getting the ball rolling for
  the new campaign at 3pm (BST), followed by Rangers’ trip to Fir Park for their
  season-opener against Motherwell. Cardiff City 2-1 Peterborough (L) Blackpool
  v Stevenage Bradford City v Wycombe Burton v Mansfield Town Doncaster Rovers v
  Exeter Huddersfield Town v Leyton Orient Lincoln City v Reading Plymouth
  Argyle v Barnsley Rotherham United v Port Vale Wigan v Northampton Town
  Accrington Stanley v Gillingham Barnet v Fleetwood Town Bristol Rovers v
  Harrogate Town Cambridge United v Cheltenham Chesterfield v Barrow Colchester
  v Tranmere Rovers Grimsby Town v Crawley Town MK Dons v Oldham Athletic
  Newport County v Notts County Salford City v Crewe Shrewsbury Town v Bromley
  Walsall v Swindon Town Luton Town 1-0 AFC Wimbledon League One match report: A
  late, unlucky Ryan Johnson own goal gifted all three points to the hosts and
  suggested that Luton’s fortunes might finally have changed for the better
  after back-to-back relegations. Matthew Dunn was at Kenilworth Road last night
  to see the opening game of the EFL season … Once more on to the hamster wheel,
  as the marathon that is the new season’s EFL gets under way in earnest after
  last night’s League One curtain-raiser between Luton Town and AFC Wimbledon at
  Kenilworth Road. The Hatters were somewhat fortunate to come away with all
  three points, after Ryan Johnson capped an otherwise decent display by
  over-stretching for a header, only to loop the ball into his own net for the
  only goal of the game five minutes from time. Today’s early action kicked off
  in Wales, where Brian Barry-Murphy is taking charge of his first game as
  Cardiff City manager. Yet to sign a player this summer after their relegation
  from the Championship, the Bluebirds are currently all square with
  Peterborough United after Rubin Colwill cancelled out Bradley Ihionvien’s
  first-half penalty at the Cardiff City Stadium with a wonderful free-kick.
  Theirs is one of 10 games being played in the third tier today and with 12
  more being played in the division below, we have no shortage of action to stay
  across. We’ll bring you news of the goals as they go in and flag up any major
  talking points along the way.

League One: Charlie Webster scores his second eye-catching goal of the afternoon to notch up the first double of his career and give Burton Albion a 2-0 lead against Mansfield Town at the Pirelli Stadium.

League Two: Elliott Bonds spanks a shot past Owen Evans from about 14 yards to double Fleetwoood’s lead against Barnet. League One: I can confirm that Fraser Murray has never played in goal for Rangers but a cursory bit of research reveals he has played in midfield for both Hibernian and Kilmarnock, who he was playing for as recently as last season. His curled strike from just inside the penalty area took a wicked deflection on its way past Northampton goalkeeper Lee Burge. League One: A bad afternoon for Kevin Nolan has just got worse after his Northampton side conceded their third goal without reply to Wigan. Fraser Murray, who with a name like that sounds like he should be playing in goal for Rangers, extends Wigan’s lead at the Brick Community Stadium. Those first halves: I was rather hoping for a gentle reintroduction to the occasional chaos that is the Guardian’s Saturday clockwatch but the goals have been flying in courtesy of all these restless players who are clearly champing at the bit after their summer holidays in Ibiza. Of course a few of them, specifically Barnet’s goalkeeper, Owen Evans, have been playing like they’re still on the sun-lounger with their noses buried in the latest John Grisham novel. Anyway, it’s good to be back! A late goal for Stevenage: I’m afraid I jumped the gun there and got caught out!

League Two: Conor Thomas restores Crewe’s lead over Salford City, putting them 2-1 ahead against Karl Robinson’s side.

Here’s hoping the supporter in question is OK. League One: Port Vale’s return to League One under Darren Moore could scarcely be going more badly. Already two down against Rotherham to a Sam Nombe brace, they’ve just lost Jaheim Headley to a red card for a high challenge on the goalscorer.

League One: Burton lead Mansfield Town 1-0 in a Nigel Clough derby that isn’t currently going Nigel Clough’s side’s way.

League One: Plymouth Argyle, who are being managed by Tom Cleverley, thought they’d opened the scoring against Barnsley courtesy of a Caleb Watts strike from eight yards but his effort has been disallowed. Transfer watch: I’ve just discovered that my compatriot the Rep of Ireland striker Aaron Connolly plays for Leyton Orient and has lined up with the Os to face Huddersfield Town today. The last I heard, Connolly was at Millwall. Our three o’clock kick-offs are go. Well, most of them are. We’ve yet to hear if the game between Newport County and Notts County at Rodney Parade was able to get under way after an air ambulance had to land on the pitch earlier so its occupants could attend to a fan who fell ill in the stands. Not long now: It’s the hope that kills you and all over the UK, fans of teams in Leagues One and Two are brimful of optimism ahead of today’s three o’clock kick-offs as their teams prepare for their first games of the season. While your team can’t win the league on the opening day of the season, they can certainly give fans a fairly good idea of which end of the table they’ll be battling on the last day! Sheffield Wednesday: In some rare good news during desperate times for Sheffield Wednesday fans, club captain Barry Bannan has signed a new contract with the troubled Championship club. The 35-year-old midfielder, who had attracted interest from Millwall and Middlesbrough after his previous deal expired, has committed to the Sheffield Wednesday at the end of a week in which the club failed to pay their players and other staff on time for the third successive month. The club has not disclosed the details of Bannan’s new deal. “This club is a big part of me and my family, who are with me here today as I’m signing,” said Bannan. “They will always stand by me with whatever decision I make and I’ve decided to stay. With the season getting closer, this last week has been tough because there was interest from elsewhere and I had a lot to think about. We had a lot of conversations as a family and when I told my daughter Elsie that I might be leaving she started crying. Then last night when I told her I was staying she started crying again. I asked her why and she said they are just happy tears.” Bannan has made a total of 447 appearances for the Owls, placing him eighth on the club’s all-time list. his new deal comes two days after it was revealed players and staff had refused to take part in a scheduled behind-closed-doors friendly against Burnley scheduled for today. That game was cancelled amid an escalating financial crisis at Hillsborough under owner Dejphon Chansiri and caused growing concern within the English Football League over whether the club will be able to play their opening game of the season at Leicester on 10 August. Wednesday have been placed under several EFL embargoes for breaching financial rules. They currently have only 16 senior players contracted to the club following the departures of Djeidi Gassama, Anthony Musaba, Josh Windass and Michael Smith. The latter two had their contracts terminated by mutual consent to allow them to join Wrexham and Preston. The latest missed payments to players and staff in July heaped further pressure on Chansiri, who insists he is willing to sell the club for the right price. He recently revealed he had rejected one consortium’s £40million bid, while talks with various other interested parties have stalled. Newport County: The League Two club have announced on social media that the kick-off for their game against Notts County is “likely” to be delayed after a fan took ill in the stands, prompting an air ambulance to land on the pitch at Rodney Parade. “We send our very best wishes to the individual concerned,” wrote the club on X. League One: Cardiff City have got their third tier campaign off to a winning start, coming from behind to beat Peterborough United in the Welsh capital.

Premier League transfer news: Callum Wilson has decided the famous West Ham striker hoodoo is nothing to be worried about and has agreed a deal to join Graham Potter’s squad on a free transfer after leaving Newcastle United in June. Wilson, 33, will sign a one-year deal with the London club. Interview: In a predictably entertaining and at times poignant sit-down, veteran manager Neil Warnock recalls the time Crystal Palace’s data boffins stopped him from signing a young Virgil van Dijk for £4m after arriving at the deranged conclusion the Dutchman was “not quick enough”, discusses his unlikely bromances with Pep Guardiola and Arsene Wenger, and looks forward to seeing his name up in lights outside the London Palladium in September. Words: Donald McRae. National League: Forest Green owner Dale Vince is one of the partners in an initiative where GPs can prescribe a day out watching his National League team as an alternative to antidepressants. And while the jokes obviously write themselves, it seems like a very good idea before a ball has been kicked in the current campaign.

Matthew Dunn was at Kenilworth Road last night to see the opening game of the EFL season … Once more on to the hamster wheel, as the marathon that is the new season’s EFL gets under way in earnest after last night’s League One curtain-raiser between Luton Town and AFC Wimbledon at Kenilworth Road. The Hatters were somewhat fortunate to come away with all three points, after Ryan Johnson capped an otherwise decent display by over-stretching for a header, only to loop the ball into his own net for the only goal of the game five minutes from time. Today’s early action kicked off in Wales, where Brian Barry-Murphy is taking charge of his first game as Cardiff City manager. Yet to sign a player this summer after their relegation from the Championship, the Bluebirds are currently all square with Peterborough United after Rubin Colwill cancelled out Bradley Ihionvien’s first-half penalty at the Cardiff City Stadium with a wonderful free-kick. Theirs is one of 10 games being played in the third tier today and with 12 more being played in the division below, we have no shortage of action to stay across. We’ll bring you news of the goals as they go in and flag up any major talking points along the way.
