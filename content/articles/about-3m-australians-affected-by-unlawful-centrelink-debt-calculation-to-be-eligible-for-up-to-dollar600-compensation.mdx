  About 3 million Australians affected by Centrelink’s unlawful debt calculation
  method will be eligible for up to $600 in compensation after the federal
  government admitted the process was invalid. The social services minister,
  Tanya Plibersek, announced on Wednesday the government would also raise the
  threshold for small, accidental debts to $250, meaning about 1.2 million debts
  are expected to be waived or not raised this financial year. Economic Justice
  Australia (EJA), which has long campaigned for the threshold for waiving debts
  to be raised, described the decision as a “gamechanger”. It is the first time
  the threshold has been increased for more than 30 years. “The complex appeal
  process for a small debt is the same as that for a larger debt so this
  decision will remove a lot of unnecessary stress from people’s lives,” the
  organisation’s chief executive, Kate Allingham, said. The decision follows a
  federal court ruling in July which found the method the social services
  department used to calculate a welfare participant’s payment – known as income
  apportionment – from the early 1990s to 2020 was invalid. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email During this period, Centrelink made assumptions about how much a
  welfare recipient earns during a reporting period to calculate their income
  support payments. The method was used for decades but was ruled unlawful,
  placing a question mark over more than $1bn in debt owed by welfare recipients
  stretching back to the late 1970s. The federal court’s July ruling confirmed
  the debt calculation method used since 2020 was valid. As a result of
  Wednesday’s announcement, people with historic debts affected by income
  apportionment from 2003 to 2020 will be eligible for resolution payments of up
  to $600. The payments will be funded through a new $300m package, which will
  also cover the cost of raising the threshold for small debts. EJA and
  Australian Council of Social Service will each be given $400,000 to help
  recipients navigate the compensation process. The government acknowledged the
  administrative cost of chasing small debts often cost more than the debt
  itself, making the process “uneconomical”. It described the announcement as an
  “important first step toward social security reform”. “Our social security
  system is designed to be there for Australians when they fall on hard times,
  which is why it’s important debt recovery processes must be fair and
  transparent,” Plibersek said. “When the system provides good outcomes for both
  recipients and taxpayers, all Australians win.” The finance minister, Katy
  Gallagher, said: “The last thing vulnerable people need is to be hounded over
  small debts that are not worth the time or the money to recover.” Legislation
  will be introduced in coming weeks to implement the package. The Greens
  welcomed the announcement as a “tremendous win” for advocates who have urged
  Labor to waive debts raised under the scheme. “Like robodebt, the income
  apportionment scandal has shown the systemic issues with the way our welfare
  system brutalises people living in poverty over ridiculous errors,” the Greens
  social services spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said. “When you’re living
  week to week on poverty payments, a debt notice from the government can cause
  your whole life to spiral. Tragically for some it has led them to take their
  own lives.” The Greens this week introduced legislation to impose a six-year
  limit on debt recovery – a recommendation from the robodebt royal commission.
  EJA also backs the six-year limit.
