  Make this the summer you get back out on the water, with fish plopping beneath
  you, bulrushes shimmying and kingfishers darting by. Even if you don’t have
  your own kayak or paddleboard festering in the garage, there are dozens of
  excellent hire places and guided tours up and down the country, on beautiful
  rivers, lakes, canals and coastlines. I’ve spent a couple of years researching
  a book about the loveliest, and here are five of my favourites. Whisky and
  wildlife, Highlands For many years the Old Forge Inn – often referred to as
  the most remote pub in mainland Britain – was well known for its live music
  sessions that would break out when the whisky started flowing. Locals and
  visitors were often moved to take down the musical instruments hanging on the
  walls and burst into tune. It sounded like the best party in the land, all the
  more so for the degree of difficulty it took to reach it, and the ridiculous
  beauty of the surroundings. It’s the only pub in the only village, Inverie, on
  the Knoydart peninsula, a heathery, mountainous hunk of the Scottish west
  coast that juts between three deep sea lochs, where seals play and
  white-tailed eagles soar. And now it’s back. There was a period when things
  went off the boil under new ownership and the parties dwindled, but in 2022 it
  was bought by the community and thrives once more. Its pontoon has space for
  six boats, or you can pull up on the beaches nearby. The Knoydart Brewery,
  occupying a deconsecrated Roman Catholic chapel here, supplies the house ales,
  while a Knoydart venison burger (£18) from the local deer estate is a menu
  must, along with cullen skink (£11). As there is no road access, people come
  by ferry from Mallaig, make the 15-mile hike from Kinloch Hourn (a taxi ride
  from Fort William), or even kayak over – a strenuous and splashy seven miles.
  Far easier is to hire a kayak when you get there from Love Knoydart and
  explore the edges of the pristine loch, looking out for sea otters. On of the
  best places to stay is the Bunkhouse, which has dorms and camping with views
  to the Isle of Rum (dorm beds from £29pp). Arisaig Sea Kayak Centre can
  tailor-make day and multi-day wild camping trips in the area from £130pp per
  day, minimum four people. A beaver safari in Kent Hunted for their pelts to
  near extinction by the 16th century, beavers have been re-established in
  certain British rivers, including a stretch of the River Stour near
  Canterbury. They were reintroduced in 2001 at Ham Fen, a Kent Wildlife Reserve
  site near Sandwich, where they thrived and spread. The most enchanting way to
  spot nature’s cutest carpenters is on a sunset safari by Canadian canoe down
  the chalk stream waterway, which ends at a riverside pub. Canoe Wild (£37pp)
  runs an atmospheric trip, timed to pass the places the beavers visit most
  frequently at dusk, when they’re most active. Starting at Grove Ferry, you’re
  whisked by minibus to the village of Fordwich for a guided paddle back of just
  under five miles. On my September trip, a glorious pink sunset was the
  backdrop at Bootleg Lake, around which many beavers have dens, and we began to
  notice slippery mud chutes pocked with paw prints. Then, in the near dark …
  two loud splashes, and a dark shape careering into the water. “Definitely a
  beaver,” whispered the guides. “When they hear something coming, they whack
  their wide tails onto the water to scare away predators.” Even a shadowy
  splosh felt Attenborough-level exciting under a blazing Milky Way, and we
  finished in the fairy-lit beer garden of the ivy-wreathed Grove Ferry Inn.
  Nethergong campsite nearby has pitches from £42.50, as well as a sauna, yoga
  and bushcraft classes. A hidden brewery in Hampshire This fantastically quirky
  paddle involves a hidden creek, accessible only at high tide, and a place
  where you can order your drink to be brought straight to your paddleboard or
  kayak. This beer pilgrimage is on the tidal River Hamble, a baby river of 6.3
  miles that flows east of Southampton towards the Solent. At its narrow upper
  end, near Botley, spidery creeks run off at the sides, including one leading
  to the Botley Brewery’s Hidden Tap bar. Those with their own kit can park at
  Burridge recreation ground on the east side of the river, then follow a leafy
  footpath through woods to the water. Or launch further upriver from YMCA
  Fairthorne (for a £5.50 fee), which rents paddleboards and kayaks and has a
  cafe and campsite (hire from £20, pitches for four people from £39). Heading
  upstream towards Botley, the river becomes gentler, narrower and shallower
  until it feels like an otherworldly bayou. Set off at least two hours before
  high tide so it’s high at the upper, final navigable end of the river, follow
  the stream through a tunnel and emerge at the foot of the brewery wall. You
  yell your order up and your pint is lowered down in a wooden box to be sipped
  while you float. Another short channel, Curbridge Creek, leads to the Horse
  and Jockey pub’s waterside beer garden. Let off steam by the Severn Paddling
  back the way you’ve come can be a downer, not to mention hard work if it means
  going against the flow, so River Severn Canoes’ solution is rather brilliant.
  At the end of its self-guided trips down the River Severn from the Shropshire
  town of Bridgnorth you abandon your vessel and catch a steam train back on the
  Severn Valley Railway to Highley (£15). Routes of several lengths are
  available, including four hours to Arley (10½ miles). Halfway along there’s a
  picnic stop on a beach at the village of Hampton Loade, where you could also
  have a cuppa and a jacket potato at the Unicorn Inn (mains from £7). It has
  nine (quite basic) B&amp;B rooms as well as a campsite (pitches for one tent
  sleeping 2-4 people from £20), if you want to make this your base. Finish in
  Upper Arley in Worcestershire, home to another traditional, 500-year-old pub,
  The Harbour. Trains run between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth, stopping at
  Bewdley, Arley and Hampton Loade. Those with their own kayak or SUP can take
  them on the train for a £5 fee. In Bridgnorth, The Falcon Hotel (doubles from
  £140) has 14 rooms with whitewashed beams and exposed brick. River Severn
  Canoes also offers multi-day trips down the river, stopping at campsites.
  Kingfishers and canoes in Cardigan Paddling along the thickly wooded tidal
  gorge of the River Teifi in Canadian canoes feels utterly otherworldly:
  peregrine falcons zip from steep banks, kingfishers dart above water busy with
  salmon, sewin (sea trout) and otters, and there’s a little patch of rapids to
  tackle on an otherwise gentle two-hour tour with Heritage Canoes (£45
  adults/£32.50 children). From its woodland base at the Welsh Wildlife Centre
  and Teifi Marshes nature reserve it’s two miles upriver to Cilgerran, where a
  13th-century castle towers above the river. Stay at glamping site Fforest Farm
  (two nights’ B&amp;B for two from £340), a 10-minute drive east of Cardigan,
  with a range of cabins and tents – the geodesic domes come with their own
  Japanese-style wooden bathhouse with a super-deep tub. The site has its own
  atmospheric pub, Y Bwthyn, in a barely converted barn only open to guests,
  where candles send their twitchy glow onto slate windowsills, cocktails are
  made with foraged botanicals and local ale comes fresh from the cask.
  Cilgerran has a couple of heartwarming pubs, including the Cardiff Arms (no
  website), with a coracle hung outside; or head to Cardigan’s waterside bar at
  Albion Aberteifi, Fforest’s hip apart-hotel, or, on the opposite bank, its
  Pizzatipi, which has a festival feel. Gemma Bowes’ Paddle and Pub is published
  by Bloomsbury (£19.99). Order a copy at guardianbookshop.com.. More details on
