  Air Canada’s flight attendants plan to remain on strike, their union has said,
  defying government efforts to force them back to work and into binding
  arbitration over a dispute that has left more than 100,000 travellers stranded
  around the world during the peak summer travel season. About 10,000 flight
  attendants who work for Canada’s largest airline walked out on the job early
  on Saturday amid a bitter dispute over what the union has described as
  “poverty wages” and unpaid labour. Around the same time, Air Canada, which
  operates about 700 flights a day, said it would begin locking flight
  attendants out of airports. Less than 12 hours later, the Canadian government
  said it had ordered an end to the work stoppage, leading Air Canada to
  announce plans to resume flying by Sunday evening. However, that timeline was
  thrown into question after the union told Reuters it would challenge the
  return-to-work order, which it described as unconstitutional. It was the
  latest twist in talks that have dragged on since March as the flight
  attendants seek to address the fact that they are not compensated for work
  carried out when planes are not in the air such as time spent on the ground
  between flights or helping passengers to board. On Saturday, Canada’s federal
  jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, said it was clear the talks had reached an impasse
  and that the impact was being felt by Canadians and visitors across the
  country. “The talks broke down,” said Hajdu as she told reporters that she had
  asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order an immediate end to the
  strike and to impose binding arbitration. “It is clear that the parties are
  not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will
  need help with the arbitrator.” She appeared to link her actions to the toll
  that US tariff increases had taken on the Canadian economy. “In a year in
  which Canadian families and businesses have already experienced too much
  disruption and uncertainty, this is not the time to add additional challenges
  and disruptions to their lives and our economy,” she said in a statement.
  Hajdu’s power to halt the strike stems from a section of the Canada Labour
  Code, which gives the minister unilateral authority to end work stoppages in
  order to “maintain or secure industrial peace”. While the section was rarely
  used by previous governments, the Liberal government has invoked it several
  times in the past year, quelling strikes by workers at Canadian ports, the
  post office and railway companies. Analysts have voiced concerns that the use
  of the clause may be undermining workers’ rights. The union representing the
  flight attendants decried the Liberal government for stepping in within hours,
  accusing it of violating their right to take job action. Air Canada had
  reportedly previously requested that the government intervene to impose
  binding arbitration. Wesley Lesosky, of the Canadian Union of Public
  Employees, said the government was giving “Air Canada exactly what they want –
  hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the
  company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation”.
  According to the aviation analytics firm Cirium, the airline had cancelled 671
  flights by Saturday afternoon, leaving some travellers stranded overseas and
  others scrambling to find alternatives during the busy summer travel season.
  About 130,000 customers a day could be affected by a disruption, according to
  the airline. The airline said earlier it had offered its flight attendants “an
  increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the union said the
  figure failed to fully account for inflation. Air Canada also said it was
  willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes
  take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully
  compensated for their labour. About 70% of the airline’s flight attendants are
  women, said Natasha Stea, a local union president and flight attendant. She
  questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada
  pilots, the vast majority of whom are men, received a significant raise last
  year. “We are heartbroken for our passengers,” she told the Associated Press
  late last week. “Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their
  travel plans, but we cannot work for free.”
