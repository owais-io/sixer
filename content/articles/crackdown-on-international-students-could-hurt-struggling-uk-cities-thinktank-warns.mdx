  A crackdown on international students in Britain could hurt struggling cities
  where universities help power the local economy, the government has been
  warned. Tens of thousands of overseas students are being contacted by the Home
  Office to tell them they will be removed from the UK if they overstay their
  visas and have no legal reason to stay. However, the Centre for Cities
  thinktank said the changes could have a bigger negative impact for places
  outside London and the south-east of England that were more reliant on their
  universities for economic activity. As almost 3 million students return to
  universities across the UK this month, it said that Labour would face tensions
  between its growth mission and the plan to curb net migration levels. While
  stating that a crackdown on the higher education sector could have a negative
  impact for the country at large, Centre for Cities said the impact would be
  more heavily felt in cities including Leicester, Plymouth, Hull and
  Stoke-on-Trent. This is because their local universities play an outsized role
  in supporting jobs, economic activity and exports in these places compared
  with more prosperous university towns such as Oxford and Cambridge. “Any
  changes will be felt widely across the country but particularly in cities with
  struggling economies where universities are one of the most important
  exporting industries,” it said in the report. Growing numbers of universities
  in England are being drawn into a financial crisis driven by falling
  international student numbers, funding cuts and below-inflation increases in
  tuition fees for UK students. Several institutions are millions of pounds in
  deficit, while some are at risk of collapse. Dundee University has received up
  to £40m of emergency support from the Scottish government. The sector has
  become increasingly reliant on overseas students as an important source of
  revenue, with their total contribution rising from about 5% in 1995 to about a
  quarter of all income. However, this income is being put at risk by
  restrictions on foreign students’ dependents coming to Britain, the
  government’s immigration white paper proposal to limit the graduate visa and a
  levy on international student fees. Highlighting the “town and gown”
  connection between universities and their communities, Centre for Cities said
  some places were more heavily reliant than others on the presence of a higher
  education institution. Higher education is among the top 10 sectors for
  exports in most cities and large towns with universities because of the
  fee-paying international students they attract to the local area. However, the
  report found the sector leads global activity in Exeter, Dundee, Leicester and
  Nottingham. Higher education also generates a higher share of exports than
  legal services in Cardiff, and than metal manufacturing in Sheffield. Local
  universities’ share of high-skilled knowledge jobs is also high in places like
  Plymouth (32% of all knowledge-sector jobs), Stoke (31%), Hull (24%) and
  Sunderland (18%). Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Centre for Cities,
  said universities were significant economic assets across the country, but
  particularly in places that had relatively little private sector high-skilled
  employment or exports. “Many UK universities are under financial strain,
  raising questions about their future. Any changes to higher education policy
  will not be felt evenly across the country,” he said. “National reforms that
  weaken the sector risk cutting across the government’s ambitions for
  delivering growth everywhere.” A government spokesperson said: “This report
  rightly highlights the value of our world class universities to their
  communities and the wider British economy, and we recognise the valuable
  contributions which international students make as part of that. “We are
  exploring the introduction of a levy on the money which universities make from
  international students, which would see the funds reinvested into our higher
  education and skills system to unlock opportunity and drive growth. “To put
  universities on a secure financial footing, through our Plan for Change, we
  have increased tuition fees for the academic year 2025/26 in line with
  forecast inflation and refocused the Office for Students to monitor the
  financial health of the sector.”
