  You’ve rid your kitchen of plastic utensils and replaced them with olive wood
  chopping boards, beech spatulas and spoons. But there’s an art to taking care
  of these implements so that they stay in good shape and last as long as
  possible. Here are the dos and don’ts – from an array of experts – for keeping
  your wooden utensils in peak condition, so that they’re a part of your kitchen
  for years to come. *** How to care for wooden kitchen utensils *** Know your
  wood Always choose a hard-wearing wood that will stand up to kitchen use.
  “Hardwoods are usually best for boards and utensils: beech, maple and walnut,”
  says furniture-maker Chris Holland. “They have got a tight grain, which means
  less moisture and dirt can get in, and they resist deep knife marks better.
  Olive wood is another good choice – it’s beautiful, naturally oily, and
  resistant to staining – but it’s quite hard, so it can dull knives quicker.
  Ash is tough and light, but has a more open grain, so it needs regular oiling
  to keep moisture out.” Walnut wood chopping board From £39 at ProCook Beech
  wood chopping board £19.99 at Lakeland Maple wood chopping board £69.99 at
  Amazon *** Avoid the dishwasher Whatever tree they come from, the first rule
  of looking after wooden kitchen items is probably the most frequently broken.
  “Don’t put them in the dishwasher,” says Holland. “It will strip off any
  protective treatment straight away.” The water temperature in a dishwasher
  rises to a point where it’s in effect steaming the wood. The result, Holland
  says, is that the wood expands, with any protective oils in the fibres washed
  away. To clean chopping boards, spoons, spatulas and so on, simply hand-wash
  in warm water with a gentle washing-up liquid. Avoid scrubbing too hard with a
  scourer and don’t use abrasive cleaning products. Dry off any excess water
  immediately with a tea towel. For an extra clean, says Jo Hadlow-Davies of
  Pembrokeshire-based Edge Handcrafted Tables and Furniture: “Rub a slice of
  lemon over a chopping board that has been used for something with a strong
  flavour, such as onions, to get rid of those odours before washing.” *** Store
  well Leave chopping boards on their long edge to avoid warping, and allow them
  to dry fully before you reuse. For utensils, stand them up in a pot to dry,
  and make sure there is no part left sitting in water. *** Nourish and protect
  Wooden utensils can become tired and fluffy after a while, with the wood
  fibres catching on your tea towels, for example. When this happens – or,
  preferably, before it does – use a treatment to nourish and protect it.
  Anything you put on the wood must be food-safe, and you don’t want it to alter
  the flavour of your food. “You can use olive oil [now and then], but you
  should only do this with items that you use and wash every day,” says
  Hadlow-Davies. If not, you could end up with a board that starts to go rancid.
  For less frequently used items, a longer-lasting treatment is better. All the
  treatments below are suitable for all woods (though you may want to test on a
  small area to check if it will affect the colour). You can repeat whenever
  necessary – once a month should be sufficient, but if you use items often or
  they start to look a little dry, you can always increase the frequency.
  “Whatever [treatment] you use, washing will wear it away over time, so the
  only way to keep the wood properly protected is to reapply it,” says Holland.
  “A light sand and re-oil every so often will keep it looking good and lasting
  longer.” Assorted sandpaper sheets £5.99 for 10 at Amazon Pure oils Linseed
  oil is a natural, non-toxic treatment tha’s good on any wood, says Mark
  Finney, of Finney’s Wood Finishes in Chesterfield. Tung oil is often
  recommended for oak but, again, can be used on any wood. Both are frequently
  used on kitchen worktops. They’re applied with a brush or lint-free cloth to
  chopping boards, spoons and spatulas, wooden knife handles, and any other
  utensils that need protecting. Lint-free cloths £4.99 for five at Amazon
  Synthetic mix bristle flat brush £6.99 at B&amp;Q These pure oils tend to be
  slow drying, though – linseed can take two to four days and tung oil at least
  four. Finney says purpose-made products, while retaining the qualities of the
  pure raw oils, can be easier to use. Danish oil is a good alternative, he
  says: use a clean, lint-free soft cloth or brush to coat the wood liberally
  with the oil, then wipe off the excess after a few minutes. Raw linseed oil
  £3.98 for 500ml at DIY Direct £6.25 for 250ml at B&amp;Q Tung oil £12.66 for
  250ml at B&amp;Q £19.98 for 500ml at Tool Station Danish oil £10.99 for 250ml
  at B&amp;Q £13 for 500ml at Wickes Mineral oils There’s a wide variety of
  food-safe mineral oils on the market, and they all do broadly the same thing:
  nourish, protect and create water resistance. Holland recommends Chestnut’s
  food-safe oil: “It soaks into the wood, slows down moisture getting in, and
  helps reduce staining,” he says. Apply the oil directly to the wood with a
  clean cloth or brush and leave to dry between coats – it should take about two
  hours. The manufacturers recommend up to three coats, but you should stop
  applications when the oil no longer soaks into the surface, as this means it
  has absorbed as much as it can. Wipe off any surplus with a clean cloth.
  Finney recommends German wood-finish company Osmo’s range of oils for chopping
  boards, surfaces and utensils. It suits all woods and can even be used on
  children’s toys. Apply thinly using a brush or lint-free cloth – this one will
  dry overnight, in eight to 10 hours. Osmo top oil £22.40 for 500ml at Wood
  Finishes Direct £22.99 for 500ml at Brewers Chestnut food-safe oil £12.18 for
  500ml at Amazon Food-safe wood oil £11 for 250ml at John Lewis Waxes Instead
  of food-grade mineral oil, which is a byproduct of the petrol industry, there
  are plenty of natural alternatives, such as beeswax and oils sourced in the
  UK. Use a soft cloth to work the wax into the wood in circular motions.
  Beeswax board wax £12.99 for 250ml at Etsy *** Repurpose, recycle, replace
  When wooden kitchen items reach the end of their natural lives, they should go
  to your local household waste recycling centre, be repurposed for arts and
  crafts (think googly eyes on wooden spoon dolls), or even used in the garden
  (check out this ingenious idea for a trellis made from wooden spoons). But how
  do you know when it’s time to let go? “If cracks or splits stop you from
  cleaning the surface properly, then it’s time to replace it,” says Holland.
  “Dirt and bacteria can get trapped, and no amount of oiling will solve that.
  The same goes if it’s warped or feels like it might break in use.” *** Sandra
