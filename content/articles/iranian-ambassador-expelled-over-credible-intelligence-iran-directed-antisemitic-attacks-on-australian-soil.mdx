  Iran directed at least two attacks against Australia’s Jewish community, the
  domestic spy agency has determined, prompting the Albanese government to expel
  Tehran’s ambassador to Canberra from Australia. The prime minister announced
  on Tuesday that the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio)
  had “credible intelligence” to determine the Iranian government was behind the
  attacks against the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne and Lewis’s
  Continental Kitchen in Bondi in Sydney. The Asio director-general, Mike
  Burgess, said the attacks had been ordered by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
  Guard Corps (IRGC), working through a “layer cake of cut-outs” – paid
  intermediaries acting in Australia. The IRGC will be listed as a terrorist
  organisation, with new laws to be considered by federal parliament. Iran’s
  ambassador to Australia, Ahmad Sadeghi, has been designated “persona non
  grata” by the Australian government and Australia’s embassy in Tehran will
  suspend operations. Iranian diplomats posted to Australia were not involved,
  Burgess said. Six diplomatic staff posted to Iran were moved to a third
  country before the announcement was made. “These were extraordinary and
  dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian
  soil,” Albanese said. “They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow
  discord in our community. It is totally unacceptable.” Albanese said told the
  lower house in question time on Tuesday that it was the “most serious
  response” any Australian government had given, adding “we don’t expel an
  ambassador lightly”. Burgess said his agency was investigating other incidents
  for possible Iranian government involvement but did not believe Iran was
  involved in every act of antisemitism in Australia. “It goes without saying
  that Iran’s actions are unacceptable. They put lives at risk, they terrified
  the community and they tore at our social fabric. Iran and its proxies lit the
  matches and fanned the flames,” he said. “This was directed by the IRGC
  through a series of overseas cut-outs, facilitators, to coordinators that
  found their way to tasking Australians.” Burgess said the alleged perpetrators
  were paid to make the attacks, and that it was aimed at “at messing with
  social cohesion”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Iran’s
  actions warranted the first removal of a foreign ambassador to Canberra since
  the postwar period. “That is why we have declared Iran’s ambassador to
  Australia persona non grata, as well as three other Iranian officials, and
  they will have seven days to leave the country,” Wong said. The opposition
  leader, Sussan Ley, said the Coalition was, in unison with the government,
  “disgusted to learn of the serious and chilling foreign interference which has
  been perpetrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran on Australian soil”. “These
  acts of egregious foreign interference are brazen attempts to cleave apart our
  social cohesion,” she said. Changes to the federal criminal code will be
  required to list the IRGC as a terror group, because the current legal regime
  for official designation only considers non-state groups. Guardian Australia
  has contacted the Iranian embassy in Canberra. Israel’s embassy in Canberra
  welcomed the decision, saying it was warranted. “This is a step we have long
  advocated for … A strong and important move,” a spokesperson said. In January,
  the Australian Federal Police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told political
  leaders police were investigating whether criminals were being paid by foreign
  agitators based in the Middle East to whip up antisemitic hatred in Australia.
  The Adass Israel synagogue was set ablaze in December, an incident the prime
  minister immediately labelled as an act of antisemitism. The synagogue
  incident was among the first in a months-long wave of attacks against
  Australia’s Jewish community. In January, federal police said they were
  probing whether the attacks could be linked by a group of paid actors, or
  “criminals for hire”, rather than ideologically motivated offenders. Two men
  have been arrested in relation to the synagogue fire bombing. In July, the AFP
  deputy commissioner for national security, Krissy Barrett, said the
  investigation was not contained to Australia, and that the AFP was “working
  closely” with Five Eyes and international partners. The Iranian regime has
  previously been accused of engaging criminal gangs to carry out attacks
  overseas. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Albanese
  government’s decision to support a UN resolution calling for an end to
  Israel’s occupation of Gaza was to blame for the December synagogue attack.
  “It is impossible to separate this reprehensible act from the extreme
  anti-Israeli position of the Labor government in Australia,” he wrote on X.
