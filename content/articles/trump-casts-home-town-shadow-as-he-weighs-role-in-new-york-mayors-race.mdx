  Millions of people will go to the polls in New York City in November, but in a
  closely watched election for mayor it’s a high-profile, highly unpopular
  former New Yorker who is attracting most of the attention. Donald Trump, who
  spent nearly seven decades in New York before leaving town after his first
  term as president, is the ghost at the feast in America’s biggest city, a
  looming presence as he weighs whether to insert his considerable heft into the
  race. In recent weeks, Trump has taken an increased interest in his home
  town’s mayoral election and is considering whether to back a candidate,
  according to reports. It’s a development that adds another layer of complexity
  to a race that has already seen it all: from the leading candidate, Zohran
  Mamdani, being threatened by Trump with deportation, to an apparent attempt at
  bribery via cash stuffed into a bag of potato chips. Trump had a phone call
  about the race with Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic New York governor and
  Mamdani’s rival, in recent weeks, according to the New York Times. It came as
  wealthy New Yorkers are seeking to thwart Mamdani, the 33-year-old Democratic
  socialist who delighted the American left when he defeated Cuomo in the
  Democratic primary. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid a sexual
  misconduct scandal, is attempting to revive his dream of becoming mayor by
  running as an independent. The president also has links to the incumbent, Eric
  Adams, who has benefited more than most from Trump’s re-election. Adams, a
  Republican turned Democrat turned independent, was charged in September last
  year with accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish
  officials in exchange for favors. In April this year, the justice department,
  headed by Trump loyalist Pam Bondi, successfully lobbied for the case against
  Adams to be dropped – a move which came after Adams took a more hardline,
  Trumpian stance on immigration. So far, neither man has successfully won over
  Trump, and a White House official told the Guardian that the president has
  said he does not intend to get involved. But the speculation of a presidential
  incursion just won’t go away. Trump has said Cuomo should stay in the race,
  and even praised Adams in a recent press conference – during which he also
  described Mamdani as a “communist”. “You have a good independent running:
  Mayor Adams who is a very good person. I helped him out a little bit. He had a
  problem and he was unfairly hurt,” Trump said. The intrigue comes as Mamdani,
  who has terrified New York’s powerful real-estate lobby and billionaire class
  by promising to freeze rent prices and raise taxes – slightly – on the
  wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers, is on the verge of running away with the race.
  For weeks, polls have shown Mamdani ahead of Adams, Cuomo, and the Republican
  Curtis Sliwa. A survey this week showed Mamdani winning 42% of the vote, with
  his nearest challenger Cuomo on just 23%. The poll, published by AARP, showed
  that Mamdani’s support would increase if Cuomo or Adams dropped out. Cuomo and
  Adams have shown signs that they may be open to Trump. In audio obtained by
  Politico, Cuomo told Trump-friendly donors in the elite enclave of the
  Hamptons that the president was likely to intervene in his favor in the
  election. Cuomo predicted to donors that Adams would drop out, and said that
  they could negate the impact of Sliwa, who has said Trump should stay out of
  the race. “Trump himself, as well as top Republicans, will say the goal is to
  stop Mamdani. And you’ll be wasting your vote on Sliwa,” Cuomo said. A
  spokesman for Cuomo, whose lawyer turned governor father at one point worked
  for Fred Trump, the wealthy real-estate developer who handed over his business
  to his son, Donald Trump, in the 1970s, told the Guardian the story was
  “overblown”. “The governor was asked what he heard to be a hypothetical about
  how it could become a two-person race and was speculating,” Rich Azzopardi
  said. “We’re not asking for or expecting help from anyone – he [Cuomo] also
  said the mayor would have to drop out and the mayor said he wasn’t going to.
  Governor Cuomo is the only chance to beat Mamdani and ensure the greatest city
  in the world stays the greatest city in the world.” Still, with Mamdani
  comfortably leading in the polls, and Adams and Cuomo seemingly cannibalizing
  each other’s support, the rightwing elite in New York are becoming
  increasingly desperate for a Trump intervention. The New York Post, the
  rightwing tabloid that Trump is known to read, sent a message directly to the
  president earlier in August, running an editorial with the headline:
  “President Trump, do what’s right for NYC and endorse Mayor Eric Adams for
  re-election.” But that wouldn’t necessarily be helpful, said Trip Yang, a
  Democratic strategist and founder of Trip Yang Strategies. “Donald Trump is
  one of the least popular individuals in New York City history. Anyone who
  Donald Trump wants, supports, is automatically going to be a loser in the New
  York City mayor’s race. He is beyond toxic,” Yang said. Trump won just 30% of
  the vote in New York City in 2024, a remarkable low for someone born and
  raised in the city. Although, it does suggest he is more popular than Adams,
  whose job approval was at a record low of 20% earlier this year. Adams and
  Cuomo are deeply flawed candidates. Cuomo was plagued by scandal in his final
  term as governor, stepping down after he was accused of sexual harassment by
  11 women, most of whom worked for him. He attempted to defy the odds by
  entering the New York mayoral election, and was originally the frontrunner,
  but ran an anonymous race, relying on tightly-controlled press conferences
  over in-person appearances. Despite wealthy backers – some of whom had donated
  to Trump – pumping millions into his campaign he finished a distant second to
  Mamdani. While those corruption charges against Adams were dropped, questions
  remain over the kind of people the mayor surrounds himself with. Multiple
  people linked to Adams have been charged with corruption, and in a bizarre
  incident just this week, a volunteer on his campaign, Winnie Greco – who until
  last year served as Adams’ liaison to the Asian community – handed a reporter
  from the City a bag of Herr’s ripple potato chips containing a red envelope
  full of cash. A lawyer for Greco, who has been suspended by the Adams
  campaign, told the City that the money-in-a-potato-chip-bag ruse was a
  misunderstanding. “In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a
  gesture of friendship and gratitude,” the lawyer said. In a statement to the
  Guardian, Adams said: “I have not been accused of any wrongdoing, and my focus
  remains on serving the 8.5 million New Yorkers by making our city safer and
  more affordable every day.” Earlier this month, Adams left some wiggle room
  when asked if he would accept an endorsement from Trump, telling 77 ABC: “I
  want New Yorkers’ endorsement. I think the president’s going to make a
  determination on what he’s going to do in his race.” Cuomo has said he would
  not accept an endorsement. That’s probably wise given Trump’s unpopularity,
  but there have been suggestions that the president could weigh in behind the
  scenes, with the New York Times reporting that donors and allies of Adams and
  Cuomo have “pined” for Trump to intervene. Yang thinks that wouldn’t work.
  “Sometimes you could pull that off in a very local race that doesn’t get any
  attention. But look: the New York City mayor’s race, for us here in New York,
  this is our Super Bowl. Any type of private phone call, private meeting, it’s
  already shown that it gets leaked immediately to the press,” he said. “It
  would actually be net negative. It would be a good thing for Mamdani. You can
  buy a lot of things, but you cannot be associated with Donald Trump in New
  York City if you’re trying to win an election.” What is clear is that if the
  election happened today, rather than on Tuesday 4 November, Mamdani would win.
  And so far the questions about Trump’s links with Adams and Cuomo have seemed
  to be a blessing for the frontrunner. Mamdani responded to the leaked Cuomo
  audio this week, writing on Instagram: “This is not just a shady backroom deal
  by a cynical politician, it is disqualifying. It is a betrayal. Donald Trump
  is sending masked agents to rip our neighbors off the street, gutting the
  social services so many New Yorkers rely on, and threatening to deport me for
  having the audacity to stand up to him and his billionaire friends.” Mamdani
  added: “The job of New York City mayor is not to be a jester for a wannabe
  king, it is to protect the people of this city.” With less than three months
  to go, it remains to be seen whether Trump will move to select a jester, or
  whether he will leave the people of New York City, the city that spurned him,
  alone.
