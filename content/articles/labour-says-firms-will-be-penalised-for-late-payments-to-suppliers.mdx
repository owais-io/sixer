  Keir Starmer has warned businesses who persistently delay payments to their
  suppliers that it is “time to pay up” as the government prepares to impose
  fines and penalties on repeat offenders. In what Labour has billed as the
  toughest crackdown on late payments in a generation, the business secretary,
  Jonathan Reynolds, will say on Thursday that the changes will slash a cost to
  the economy that has escalated to £11bn a year. As many as 38 businesses shut
  down each day partly owing to late payments, the government said, hurting
  tradespeople, shopkeepers, startup founders and family-run firms. The planned
  changes will include handing the small business commissioner powers to impose
  fines, potentially worth millions of pounds. Established in 2016 to tackle
  late payments, the watchdog will also be able to carry out spot checks, verify
  claims and impose deadlines to clear a backlog of disputes. As part of a wider
  Labour drive to provide more support for small businesses, Reynolds will also
  announce startup loans for 69,000 companies worth £4bn “to inspire the next
  generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners”. The move is backed by
  the prime minister and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is keen to focus on
  rebooting the economy after two consecutive months of negative growth and
  mounting speculation about tax rises. According to the Office for National
  Statistics, the economy contracted by 0.1% in May after a 0.3% monthly fall in
  April. Sir Keir said it was important for the government to support small- and
  medium-sized firms, which employ 60% of the workforce and generate £2.8tn in
  turnover. “From builders and electricians to freelance designers and
  manufacturers, too many hardworking people are being forced to spend precious
  hours chasing payments instead of doing what they do best, growing their
  businesses. “It’s unfair, it’s exhausting and it’s holding Britain back. So,
  our message is clear: it’s time to pay up.” Reynolds is expected to say
  legislation will include maximum payment terms of 60 days before a reduction
  after an introductory period to 45 days, “giving firms certainty they’ll be
  paid on time”. Ministers said last September that they would consult
  businesses about the most effective way to tackle a “culture of late payment”
  after several attempts by previous Tory administrations to toughen existing
  codes of conduct. Reynolds will say new laws were needed to give the
  commissioner extra powers and force large companies to be more transparent
  about how they pay subcontractors and suppliers. As part of the plan, audit
  committees will be required to scrutinise payment practices at board level,
  “placing greater pressure on large firms to show they’re treating small
  suppliers fairly backed by mandatory interest charges for those who pay late”.
  The small business minister, Gareth Thomas, said: “I hear all too often about
  businesses who just don’t have the cash needed to start up or grow. Today,
  we’ve announced measures as part of our plan for change to tackle all of those
  issues and beyond.”
