  The political conversation is becoming ever more focused on migration, with
  Reform UK leader Nigel Farage determined to make small boat crossings and
  asylum seekers the central domestic policy topic while parliament is in
  recess. The summer has witnessed a clear rise in nationalistic rhetoric with
  anti-migrant rallies outside hotels alongside a campaign to raise the flags of
  St George and the union jack. For our cover story, Esther Addley examines the
  increasingly febrile climate across the country and hears why observers are
  concerned at the lack of government pushback against far-right orchestrated
  protests. We return to Gaza for the big story based on a joint investigation
  by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the
  Hebrew-language outlet Local Call using information from an IDF database. Emma
  Graham-Harrison and Yuval Abraham reveal what figures collected by the Israeli
  military suggest about the conduct of their Gaza campaign. Last week, the high
  court found in favour of the Guardian after the British actor and film-maker
  Noel Clarke sued for libel over allegations of sexual misconduct. As the
  Guardian’s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner writes in Opinion, the verdict was
  a victory for the brave women who told us their stories – and for journalism.

  | No negotiation After Donald Trump mooted Ukrainian-Russian land swaps to
  achieve peace in Ukraine, Dan Sabbagh hears from residents of Donetsk about
  what they think of giving up their homeland Environment | An unlikely paradise
  Korea’s demilitarised zone has become a haven for some of Asia’s rarest
  species, finds Raphael Rashid on a trip to the edge of the uninhabited strip
  Feature | Silicon Valley highs and lows Former Facebook executive and one-time
  UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg tells Gaby Hinsliff what it was really
  like working with the tech bros and billionaires Opinion | Disillusionment
  leads to electoral disappointment It’s clear that millions of loyal voters are
  disappointed with the Democrats (and Labour too). If they fail to adapt to the
  collapse of centrist politics, says Nesrine Malik, then defeat beckons Culture
  | Fighting talk Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch rehearse a playful
  marital tiff for their new film The Roses in the presence of Catherine Shoard
  *** What else we’ve been reading Over the course of almost 70 years, the
  British photographer Martin Parr has documented the mundane and turned it into
  an art form. This collection of his life in pictures spans most of those years
  and in doing so reveals much about how Britain has changed during that time.
  Graham Snowdon, editor Dining across the divide is one of my favourite
  features from the Guardian, and I think it plays a crucial role in countering
  the narrative that the UK is irreversibly divided and a middle ground cannot
  be found. We all need to have more conversations with “the other side” as a
  collective – maybe we wouldn’t have as many problems as we do today. Craig
  Law, product marketing manager *** Other highlights from the Guardian website
