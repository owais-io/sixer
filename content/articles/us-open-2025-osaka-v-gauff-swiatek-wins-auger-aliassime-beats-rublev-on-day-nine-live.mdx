  Osaka races to 40-0 and Gauff, perhaps out of frustration, just wallops a flat
  forehand to get on the board. But it’s another simple hold, with Osaka having
  lost just two points on her serve. Osaka is 5-3 up. Gauff, from the forehand
  side, sends down a brilliant backhand winner. She holds and Osaka leads 4-3.
  Over on Louis Armstrong, 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti is underway against Jaume
  Munar and already up a break. Osaka begins with an ace down the middle and
  Gauff is struggling to make any inroads on her opponent’s serve. It’s a love
  hold and Osaka leads 4-2. Gauff’s serve remains under the spotlight and she
  begins with a double fault, but it’s smoother from there as she goes 40-15 up.
  Osaka reels off a backhand winner and takes it to deuce, but Gauff is
  victorious at the net before Osaka goes long with a down-the-line forehand.
  Osaka leads 3-2. Gauff’s forehand down the centre finds the net before Osaka
  laces a cross-court backhand to go 30-0 up. It’s another straightforward hold.
  Osaka leads 3-1. Gauff races to a love hold, a couple of aces in there, too.
  Osaka leads 2-1 in the first set. Well then, this is some start from Naomi
  Osaka. The 23rd seed is up and away with a 2-0 lead in the first set, Gauff
  beginning with a string of unforced errors. Alexandrova suffered with her
  second serves, winning just 27% of her points on those. The action doesn’t
  stop, with Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka making their way out on Arthur Ashe for
  today’s headline clash. Swiatek heads to the net to sweep away a backhand and
  go 30-15 up. Alexandrova recovers though, attacking to give herself a chance
  of survival, launching the ball deep to give Swiatek some bother on the
  baseline. But the 2022 US Open champion prevails, a backhand winner sending
  her through to the quarters. Swiatek has another chance to break, and
  Alexandrova’s fourth double fault of the match provides it. The second seed
  will serve for the match, up 6-3, 5-1. Swiatek has little to worry about at
  the moment. She’s 6-3, 4-1 up against Alexandrova. Rublev holds and
  Auger-Aliassime is up again, serving to reach the last eight. He is up to the
  net to secure the first point, a statement move. A lightning ace follows and
  another first serve sets him up for a deep forehand winner. Three match
  points: he needs just one, a backhand down the line setting up a wonderful
  victory. Auger-Aliassime is up 4-3 and serving in the third set. Rublev needs
  something to change – instead comes a complete miscue with the forehand,
  Auger-Aliassime going 30-0 up. An ace down the middle follows and the hold is
  straightforward. Auger-Aliassime leads 6-5, 6-3, 5-3. Right, how much fight
  has Rublev got in him? He came from a set down to beat Auger-Aliassime in the
  2024 Madrid Open final. He quickly holds to 15. Auger-Aliassime leads 7-5,
  6-3, 3-2. Swiatek holds to lead 5-3 before Alexandrova double-faults to set up
  deuce. Oh dear – another double fault hands Swiatek set point. The world No 2
  is gifted it, with Alexandrova netting an attempted drop shot. Swiatek takes
  it 6-3. It’s 3-3 in the first set between Swiatek and Alexandrova, with the
  latter serving. Swiatek sees an opportunity at 15-30, launching an electric
  backhand return on the second serve. And then Alexandrova has a nightmare at
  the net, setting up for a forehand smash before trying to drop the ball …
  except it doesn’t go over. Swiatek breaks and leads 4-3 in the first set.
  Rublev fails to hold his serve to start the third set. Auger-Aliassime – up
  7-5, 6-3, 1-0 – is so very close to his first grand-slam quarter-final since
  the 2022 Australian Open. Auger-Aliassime is serving for the second set – and
  he does so with aplomb, resisting as Rublev launches some flat, fizzing
  forehands. Auger-Aliassime leads 7-5, 6-3 and Rublev is showing signs of
  combustion. The Canadian launched 15 winners in that set; Rublev managed four.
  Over on Louis Armstrong, it’s 1-1 between Swiatek and Alexandrova, both
  failing to hold serve. Rublev, I should remind you, has won seven of his eight
  meetings against Auger-Aliassime. The 25th seed holds his serve and is up 7-5,
  5-2. Rublev double-faults and we’re at deuce. Auger-Aliassime loves the second
  serve, stepping inside to wallop a cross-court forehand winner. Rublev,
  furious with himself, then sends a backhand wide. He smashes his racket into
  the ground. Auger-Aliassime has the break and leads 7-5, 4-2. Iga Swiatek is
  getting ready for battle, up against Ekaterina Alexandrova, the 13th seed, who
  is yet to drop a set in the tournament. Swiatek leads 4-2 in the career
  head-to-head. Auger-Aliassime’s has a chance to get to break point ... but he
  messes up an overhead smash, sending it long. Rublev manages to hold,
  Auger-Aliassime up 7-5, 2-2. YO COUSIN! Auger-Aliassime’s forehand down the
  line has been joyous to watch. He powers his way to 15-30, but Rublev launches
  a recovery to hold. Auger-Aliassime leads 7-5, 1-1. Rublev has a break point
  in the first game of the second set but Auger-Aliassime leaps at the net to
  volley and set up deuce. A second break point is saved too, and
  Auger-Aliassime’s defence comes to the fore in a 23-shot rally that goes his
  way. He manages to hold, extending his lead to 7-5, 1-0. De Minaur prevails
  after an hour and a half, strolling into the last eight. It brings an end to a
  fine showing by Riedi, who advanced through qualifying to beat the 19th seed
  Francisco Cerundolo in the second round. Auger-Aliassime sees an opportunity
  at 15-30, advancing to the net to sweep a forehand winner and set up two set
  points. He’s looked so powerful in the last 15 minutes … but he just loses his
  radar, two forehands going wrong to prompt deuce. A forehand down the line
  ends a lengthy rally to set up a third set point … and Auger-Aliassime is
  undone by a second serve that narrowly remains in bounds. But here comes a
  fourth chance … and it’s taken! Auger-Aliassime peppers the forehands from the
  backhand corner and is up to the net to take the first set 7-5. Rublev is not
  a happy chap as he leaves the court for a breather. Auger-Aliassime is on the
  attack with his serve, two aces in the game setting him up for a 40-30 lead. A
  wide forehand from Rublev gives the Canadian a 6-5 lead in the first set.
  Elsewhere, De Minaur has taken the second set against Riedi to lead 6-3, 6-2.
  A love hold from Auger-Aliassime put him up 5-4 – he’s won 10 points in a row!
  Auger-Aliassime is a break down but his serve is still in decent order as he
  holds. Rublev leads 4-3 in the first set but Auger-Aliassime has an opening at
  0-30 after Rublev goes way wide with a backhand. Auger-Aliassime then thumps a
  forehand return on the second serve down the line to set up three break
  points. Rublev nets a backhand and that is a quickfire game from
  Auger-Aliassime, levelling up at 4-4 in the first set. De Minaur is racing
  away, up 5-0 in the second set against Riedi and about to serve. Riedi, ranked
  435 in the world, has had a fine run to this point but … oh, wait – a spanking
  forehand sets up a second break point and he takes it, pumping the right fist
  in relief, a game finally on the board. Nonetheless, De Minaur leads 6-3, 5-1.
  Rublev has a break point … and he takes it after Auger-Aliassime goes long
  with a backhand. Rublev has a 7-1 record against Auger-Aliassime – they last
  met at Hamburg in May – and he’s up 2-1 in the first set. De Minaur is looking
  rather comfortable over on Louis Armstrong. He’s already 3-0 up in the second
  set against Riedi, breaking the Swiss player’s serve twice. An overhead smash
  seals the second break. Felix Auger-Aliassime is here after trumping the third
  seed Alexander Zverev – this is his first time in the fourth round of the US
  Open since his run to the semis in 2021. He thunders an ace down to hold his
  serve and go 1-0 up in the first set against Andrey Rublev. Alex de Minaur
  takes the first set against Leandro Riedi 6-4, secured after Riedi goes long
  with a blasted forehand. The Australian has a peculiar record at the slams,
  reaching the quarter-finals of all four tournaments. But he’s still waiting
  for his first semi-final appearance. Hello, hello, hello and welcome to
  another week at Flushing Meadows. We’ve got more last-16 action in the
  singles, with eighth seed Alex de Minaur already up and running on Louis
  Armstrong, facing the Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi. Iga Swiatek’s clash with
  Ekaterina Alexandrova will follow. Felix Auger-Aliassime will open up on
  Arthur Ashe against Andrey Rublev, but the real eye-catcher is Naomi Osaka’s
  meeting with Coco Gauff, their first match at a grand slam since the 2020
  Australian Open, when a 15-year-old Gauff shocked the defending champion.
  Here’s to some more drama today.
