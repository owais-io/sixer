  The leader of the Tech Titans consortium that has bought 49% of London Spirit
  believes the Hundred will become a multibillion-dollar competition to rival
  the Indian Premier League. Nikesh Arora, the chief executive of the American
  cybersecurity company Palo Alto, was at Lord’s on Tuesday for the first two
  games in this season’s competitions, as the women and men of London Spirit
  took on their Oval Invincibles counterparts. He was joined by 15 other members
  of the Silicon Valley-based group, which includes the chief executives of
  Google, Microsoft and YouTube. The Titans stunned the sports investment world
  in January by agreeing to pay £145m for their London Spirit stake, giving by
  far the highest valuation for one of the eight Hundred franchises sold off by
  the England and Wales Cricket Board in a remarkable auction that has raised
  £520m to be reinvested in domestic cricket. Marylebone Cricket Club were given
  the other 51% by the ECB and face the task of setting up professional teams
  for the first time in the august institution’s 238-year history, a challenge
  that the MCC’s chief operating officer, Rob Lynch, describes as “extremely
  exciting”. Unsurprisingly their new partners are undaunted, either. Sitting
  high up in the Nursery End, Arora said they have never had buyer’s remorse and
  revealed that more investors have joined the consortium. While the Hundred has
  moved beyond Australia’s Big Bash League, which is now considering selling
  stakes, the IPL remains in a universe of its own with a total valuation of
  £14bn. Gujarat Titans sold a 67% stake this year in a deal that valued the
  franchise at £975m. “The IPL started from nowhere, and became a
  multibillion-dollar product,” Arora said. “Why couldn’t this be that product?
  There are eight new shareholders across eight new franchises. They all have
  successful businesses or cricket operations somewhere in the world. “If that
  energy, that passion, that creativity, that innovation is brought to this,
  imagine what they could do. The ECB incubated the Hundred, which is great, but
  I’m sure there are ways to optimise things. “We have never had buyer’s
  remorse. We’ve never been stressed about what we paid. I have more people who
  want to be part of the consortium now than I had before I made the
  investment.” Given Hundred franchises have just four home fixtures each
  season, do not own their grounds and have a domestic TV contract with Sky
  Sports that is valued at about £35m a year, other sports investors are
  intrigued about how the new co-owners plan to recoup their outlay. While the
  Titans have already been using their contacts to drive commercial growth – a
  kit deal with Nike for next season is understood to have been agreed and a
  huge push on digital content is planned – Arora claims the initial focus will
  be on improving the on-field product. The top pay bracket in the men’s
  competition has been increased from £125,000 to £200,000 this year to attract
  stars such as David Warner and his Spirit teammate Kane Williamson, and the
  aspiration is to raise it to about £500,000 in the years ahead. “In our world
  we don’t talk about money, we talk about product,” Arora said. “We ask: ‘How
  can a tech company build a great product that eventually people want?’ and
  when a lot of people want it, they will make money. “I worked at Google for 10
  years, and the chief executive [Sundar Pichai] is here tonight. We never
  talked about how much money we could make. We said: ‘Oh my God, wouldn’t it be
  cool if you could take your phone out, and it’d just tell you how to get from
  one place to the other, and it’d give you directions?’ It’s called Google Maps
  now. “Pretty much everyone uses it and would not know how to get from point A
  to point B without it. But we never started by saying: ‘How much money can we
  make?’ We said: ‘How can we make this an amazing product that people want to
  engage with?’” Satyan Gajwani, one of Arora’s key partners and a co-founder of
  Major League Cricket in the US, is convinced growth will come primarily from a
  UK audience despite the multinational makeup of the investment groups. In
  practical terms this will lead to significant increases in what are now low
  ticket prices, but there will also be innovations in broadcast deals and
  digital products. “Whether it’s MLC in the US or the Hundred here – the IPL
  may be a little bit different – I think it starts with a strong domestic
  product,” Gajwani said. “If we’re selling out stadiums and people are excited
  to watch it, that’s the major driver. And then the bleed-on effect around the
  world will happen. Bringing in stakeholders beyond governing bodies has almost
  always improved product. We’ve got eight best-in-class investors, people who
  understand business, consumers and sport, globally and locally. “And relative
  to almost every other sport, cricket has less private power, for lack of a
  better term. The NBA is run privately, the NFL is private, La Liga, the
  Premier League are private businesses. The influx of diverse views, different
  stakeholders, will bring innovation.”
