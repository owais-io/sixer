  Oligarchs whose business empire was under investigation by the Serious Fraud
  Office spied on lawyers who ran some of the UK’s most sensitive criminal
  cases. The Guardian has obtained surveillance images of former SFO prosecutors
  taken by hired spies. Their goal is said to have been gathering information on
  the agency’s activities, identifying its sources and gaining “leverage”.
  Backed with billions from Vladimir Putin’s regime, the oligarchs were at the
  time waging an aggressive counterattack against an SFO investigation into
  suspected corruption and fraud, a major case the agency ultimately dropped.
  Andy Slaughter, a Labour MP who chairs parliament’s justice committee, said:
  “It is deeply troubling that individuals with knowledge of serious fraud
  inquiries should be surveilled by the very organisations they have been
  investigating.” He added: “The hunter has become the hunted.” The surveillance
  began in 2019. It is unclear when, or if, it finished. As the law enforcement
  agency that takes on the toughest white-collar crime cases against
  multinational corporations and billionaires, the SFO often faces fightbacks by
  well-funded law firms and even cyber-attacks. But this is believed to be the
  first time surveillance of former SFO prosecutors has been revealed. Lawyers
  for the oligarchs’ mining company did not dispute that the surveillance took
  place. But they said any “investigations” into the targets were lawful,
  undertaken in preparation for lawsuits it brought against the SFO. ‘We’re not
  fair game’ On Saturday 7 March 2020, the spies pulled up in a car outside the
  home of former senior SFO prosecutor Tom Martin. At 10.39am, the target
  emerged from his front door wearing jeans and a Wolverhampton Wanderers
  hoodie. It was a momentous day: Martin was taking his young son to the
  football for the first time. Martin had run complex, transnational bribery
  investigations at the SFO. Although he never worked on the oligarchs’ case, he
  felt he would have been an attractive target for anyone seeking intelligence
  on the agency. Known to his colleagues as a charismatic leader, Martin had
  brought an employment tribunal claim over his 2018 dismissal during a power
  struggle with American prosecutors – a claim he would win. It was apparent
  from press coverage that he knew the SFO’s inner workings and had fallen out
  badly with its management. Over years of pursuing powerful suspects, Martin
  had sometimes thought he was being watched. But none of his fears were
  confirmed. He said he was “absolutely appalled” when the Guardian showed him
  surveillance images of his home taken by oligarchs’ spies. “I’m there with my
  lad,” he said. “We’re not fair game.” Martin said that if operatives were
  seeking “kompromat”, the Russian term for compromising material that can be
  used to apply pressure, there was nothing to find, except perhaps his passion
  for model trains. “It’s an attack on the rule of law,” he said. “You’re not
  trying to defend yourself in a court, you’re trying to shift the odds in your
  favour.” ‘The most upright lawyer you could ever meet’ The surveillance
  stretched across the country. In a rural village, the oligarchs’ operatives
  spied on Mike Walsh, a former Metropolitan police officer. After leaving the
  force in the late 1990s, Walsh switched to the private intelligence industry.
  One client had been in a fight with the oligarchs’ corporation over some
  African mines. In May 2019, the spies traced Walsh, who was by then retired,
  to his home and photographed him as he put the bins out. Other targets had
  held senior positions in UK law enforcement much more recently, as members of
  the very SFO team investigating the oligarchs’ affairs. James Coussey was
  awarded an OBE in 2010 after decades trying to convict the perpetrators of
  financial crimes. Three years later, he was recruited to the SFO for one last
  assignment: investigating suspected fraud and bribery at a mining company that
  had been among the most valuable listed on the London Stock Exchange. Three
  oligarchs, known as the Trio, were the founders and largest shareholders of
  the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC). It owned mines from
  Kazakhstan to Congo extracting coal, chrome and cobalt. Every few days it made
  revenues bigger than the SFO’s annual budget. The team Coussey joined followed
  money trails between Swiss banks, African kleptocracies, ex-Soviet
  dictatorships and the Mayfair property market. In 2018, after five years on
  the case, Coussey called an end to his career. “I don’t think he really wanted
  to retire,” said Martin, his SFO colleague and fellow surveillance target. “He
  loved his job and he did it in a really calm and classy way.” By then, the
  ENRC case had become one of the highest-stakes investigations in the SFO’s
  history. It seemed that criminal charges were close. The SFO’s prosecutors had
  interviewed one of the oligarchs, plus the son-in-law of another. The
  oligarchs and their company denied wrongdoing. ENRC’s lawyers were on the
  counterattack. As part of a high court claim against the SFO, they alleged
  that Coussey had negligently mishandled evidence. A judge would find no
  “knowing or reckless breach of duty”. But the legal action had revealed
  Coussey’s identity as a member of the investigation team and put him on the
  oligarchs’ radar. In retirement, Coussey fell into ill-health. The spies’
  surveillance images of him are time-stamped: a Monday morning in February
  2020. They show an elderly man outside his home, bald and bespectacled in a
  jersey and bodywarmer, pottering between the garage and a blue hatchback.
  Coussey has since died. Martin called him one of the prosecutors of his
  generation. He was “the most upright lawyer you could ever meet”, albeit with
  a fondness for rude jokes. “He’s given his country immense service.” ‘All
  about leverage’ Entrusted with powers to seize evidence, SFO prosecutors
  undergo security vetting. During his years at the agency, Martin was aware of
  “near constant” cyber-attacks. So sensitive was the oligarchs’ case that
  Coussey and the rest of the investigating team worked from a restricted area
  of the SFO’s headquarters off Trafalgar Square. Sons of the Soviet Union’s
  central Asian provinces, the Trio’s path to riches began when two of them
  worked at a KGB business venture in Moscow during the fall of communism. They
  have used an assortment of private intelligence companies since arriving in
  London in the mid-2000s. There were the former agents of Mossad and other
  Israeli intelligence and military services who set up Black Cube and
  Diligence, run by alumni of MI5 and UK special forces. These operatives
  targeted Neil Gerrard, a former ENRC lawyer who, a judge would later find,
  leaked to the SFO as he milked the oligarchs for fees. Both firms say they
  played no part in the surveillance of former SFO prosecutors. That
  surveillance began in 2019, directed by Dmitry Vozianov, a Russian consultant
  who handles “special situations” for oligarchs. Vozianov fends off threats to
  his clients’ business interests, overseeing lawyers, spies and public
  relations experts. Faced with an SFO investigation, the Trio hired him. For
  this covert surveillance operation, Vozianov deployed a decorated veteran of
  the parachute regiment. Damian Ozenbrook served in Afghanistan, Northern
  Ireland and the Balkans. After leaving the military, he set up his private
  intelligence company , Blue Square Global. The goals of the surveillance
  Vozianov assigned to Ozenbrook were “to know what was going on in the SFO”,
  said a source with knowledge of the operation, and to find out “what, if any,
  informants the SFO were using”. The source believes it was “all about
  leverage”. Vozianov did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for
  Ozenbrook’s firm did not dispute that his operatives spied on former SFO
  prosecutors on Vozianov’s instructions – though they said there had been no
  surveillance of serving SFO personnel. The oligarchs’ operatives also watched
  John Gibson, a barrister who had run the SFO’s ENRC investigation for four
  years. Gibson left the SFO for a law firm in 2018. A letter he received two
  years later from ENRC’s lawyers at the US firm Quinn Emanuel stated that he
  had been seen meeting a journalist in the National Theatre’s underground car
  park in September 2020. An SFO spokesperson said: “We have been aware of the
  risk of surveillance for many years and our first priority is always the
  safety and wellbeing of our colleagues. We note that this report relates to
  surveillance of former colleagues following their departure from the SFO.” In
  2023, after a high court judge found the SFO had been wrong to accept leaked
  material from ENRC’s lawyer at the outset of its investigation, the agency
  dropped the case. There was, it said, “insufficient admissible evidence” to
  bring charges. Two of the oligarchs have died during the long struggle with UK
  law enforcement, their stakes passing to their heirs. The Russian state banks
  that backed them are now under sanctions. Nonetheless, their corporation is
  due to receive millions from the public purse as damages. While surveillance
  by state agencies is highly regulated – the SFO would have needed a warrant to
  conduct an operation like the oligarchs’ – surveillance by private firms is
  not. Slaughter, the MP, said: “Everything about this rings alarm bells, from
  the Russia links to the involvement of ex-security force operatives.” He said
  it raised “wider issues for the government as to how it regulates private
  investigators”.
