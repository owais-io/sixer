  Pep Guardiola said he was delighted with his new signings’ immediate impact in
  Manchester City’s 4-0 rout of Wolves but insisted his squad is too big and at
  risk of being unhealthy. The summer arrivals Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan
  Cherki both scored in the victory at Molineux, where goalkeeper Ederson and
  midfielder Savinho were absent amid doubts over their long-term futures. The
  City manager said the club’s hierarchy must “find a solution” before the
  transfer window closes next month. The injured City pair Rodri and Phil Foden
  were in the stands, while Guardiola also cited Mateo Kovacic and Josko
  Gvardiol, who are both nearing returns to match fitness. Ederson has been
  linked with a move to Galatasaray while Savinho is of interest to Tottenham.
  Rico Lewis, who is wanted by Nottingham Forest, started at full-back in a sign
  he could stay at City. Asked if he was happy with his squad after the victory
  at Wolves, Guardiola replied: “Too many people. It’s not about Eddy [Ederson],
  today [there] was [no] Rodri, Phil, Kovacic, Savinho and Josko. On the bench
  we had Nathan [Aké] and Gündo [Ilkay Gündogan]. I like a deep squad to compete
  in all competitions but I don’t want to leave players at home. It’s not
  healthy. You cannot create a good vibe or atmosphere to compete. “The club has
  known [about] it since last season but the situation is what it is. In the
  next two weeks, people will talk with players and agents to find a solution.
  We have to reduce the squad because it will be difficult to sustain the vibe
  of the team.” Wolves paid tribute to Diogo Jota in their first competitive
  game since the death of their former player and his brother, André Silva.
  “Jota and his brother are in our minds and were in our hearts before, during
  and after the game,” said the Wolves head coach, their Portuguese compatriot
  Vítor Pereira. “They are still with us and we tried to do our best to honour
  them as players, people, because of their families. We will keep him in our
  hearts for the future and he will be with us for ever.” Jota’s parents and his
  wife, Rute Cardoso, were in attendance, along with his former teammate Rúben
  Neves and Portugal’s manager, Roberto Martinez.
