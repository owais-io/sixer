  The Trump administration has said it plans to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to
  Uganda, months after he was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, in a case that has
  become a flashpoint in the president’s wider crackdown on immigration. In a
  filing, lawyers for Ábrego asked the courts to dismiss the case against him on
  grounds that it is a vindictive attempt to punish him for challenging his
  initial deportation to El Salvador. The attempt to deport Garcia to far-flung
  Uganda – a country he has no known connection to – adds a new twist to a saga
  that become a lightning rod for Trump’s harsh crackdown on illegal
  immigration, which has seen rightwing supporters praise the president’s
  toughness but legal scholars and human rights advocates blast what they say is
  a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation
  of basic US law. Who is Kilmar Ábrego García? Kilmar Ábrego García, 30, grew
  up in El Salvador and fled at age 16 because a local gang extorted and
  terrorised his family, court records state. He travelled to Maryland, where
  his brother lives as a US citizen, but was not authorised to stay. Ábrego
  found work in construction and met his future wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura. In
  2018, he moved in with her and her two children after she became pregnant with
  his child. In March 2019, Ábrego went to a Home Depot seeking work as a
  labourer when he was detained by local police, court records state. The
  records say a criminal informant told police Ábrego was a member of MS-13, an
  international criminal gang, but police did not charge him and turned him over
  to the US immigration and customs enforcement (Ice). Ábrego, through his
  attorneys, has denied any affiliation with MS-13. He has no criminal record in
  either the US or El Salvador. A US immigration judge denied Ábrego’s asylum
  claim because more than a year had passed since his arrival, but the judge
  granted him protection from being deported to El Salvador, determining he had
  a “well-founded fear” of gang persecution there, court records state. Abrego
  was released and placed under federal supervision. He received a federal work
  permit and checked in with Ice each year, his lawyers said. Why has he become
  internationally renowned? In February, the Trump administration designated
  MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organisation. In March, it deported Abrego Garcia
  to a prison in El Salvador, violating the US immigration judge’s 2019 order.
  Ábrego later claimed in court documents that he was beaten and psychologically
  tortured in the El Salvador prison. The country’s president, Nayib Bukele,
  denied these allegations. The Trump administration later admitted it had
  mistakenly sent him to El Salvador’s notorious maximum security prison, but
  Donald Trump and other officials doubled down on claims that Ábrego was in
  MS-13. The US supreme court later ordered the Trump administration to
  “facilitate” the return of Ábrego. He was returned in June, and then quickly
  arrested and charged with trafficking undocumented migrants. That case stems
  from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Ábrego was driving with
  nine passengers. Tennessee police suspected human smuggling, but allowed him
  to drive on and didn’t charge him. Ábrego pleaded not guilty and his lawyers
  filed a motion to dismiss the case based on “vindictive and selective
  prosecution”. At that point he had not seen his family in more than 160 days.
  Why is he being threatened with deportation to Uganda? A US magistrate ruled
  in June that Ábrego had a right to be released from jail while he awaited
  trial, but he remained in a Tennessee jail at his attorneys’ request for about
  11 weeks over fears that Ice would immediately try to deport him. Thomas
  Giles, an assistant director for Ice, testified in July that Ábrego would be
  detained as soon as he was freed. In response to concerns Ábrego would be
  deported without due process, a US district Judge prohibited Ice from
  immediately detaining him upon release in Tennessee. Soon after this order,
  Ábrego’s attorneys asked a federal judge in Tennessee to release him. He was
  released on Friday and required to stay with his brother in Maryland and be
  subjected to electronic monitoring and home detention. In a statement on
  Friday, he said he saw his family for the first time in more than five months.
  Before he was released, government officials made him a plea offer: remain in
  custody, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa
  Rica, his lawyers said in a filing. He declined the offer. After Ábrego left
  jail, Ice told his attorneys he would be deported to Uganda and should report
  to immigration authorities on Monday. Later Friday, the government told Ábrego
  he had until first thing Monday to accept a plea in exchange for deportation
  to Costa Rica – where he will reportedly be treated as a refugee and not
  jailed – or else that offer would be off the table, his defence attorneys
  wrote. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said the administration
  would not stop fighting until he was out of the US. With Agence France-Presse
