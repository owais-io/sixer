  Caro Giles’ experiences of the school system mirror mine in many ways (Inside
  the school refusal crisis: how a mother and her daughters survived a broken
  system, 28 August). Our bright, eager, quirky son left school at 16 with no
  qualifications, despite entering year seven with a reading age of 17. The
  sausage machine of education forbids second chances and assumes homogeneity.
  Epic bullying at school and online was remedied by our son still attending
  school (box ticked), but being left alone in a room for the final few months
  leading to his GCSEs. Even prior to that, the system of negative points and
  petty uniform rules led to an attitude of resigned passivity and despair.
  Along with 30% of other 16-year-olds, he has failed English and maths, and
  joins them in the futile retake cycle until he’s 18. He is developmentally not
  ready for GCSE work: for the intensity, cramming and “learning for the test”
  that’s prescribed. He was exhausted by the cruelty of the bullying, yet no
  allowance was made for this. Instead he was praised for turning up at school
  to spend the days on his own. He asked why he was learning poems by rote, as
  he asked why he was learning fronted adverbials in year six. Even reading has
  now been targeted, with the introduction of Sparx Reader in addition to Sparx
  Maths. For my younger son, I have taken over the Sparx Reader, and my lifelong
  love of literature was tested to its limit to earn enough points to stave off
  a detention. Teachers are anxious, and the atmosphere and culture at school is
  one of fear. Fear and then relief that “my child hasn’t failed”. Our outmoded
  education system feels viscerally wrong and utterly joyless, and Caro’s
  children know it. We need a rethink. I have been radicalised by my son’s
  experiences – quite how we proceed to effect change is yet to be determined.
  Name and address supplied • Your article highlights the distress faced by many
  young people, yet it does not go far enough in questioning the assumptions
  underpinning our schooling system. As a consultant nurse and psychotherapist
  who has worked extensively in both schools and prisons and mental health
  services, I cannot ignore the institutional similarities: rigid timetables,
  enforced conformity and the pervasive use of shame as a behavioural tool. Some
  individuals adapt, even thrive, in such environments, but for many others the
  experience is terrifying, alienating and psychologically damaging. Their
  difficulties are too often pathologised, when in reality the issue lies in the
  system itself. Families who choose home education often face stigma, as though
  the decision signals deficiency in the child. This reflects a narrow view of
  learning that fails to account for individual differences. The familiar
  defence of school as a place for “social interaction” is unconvincing; by that
  logic, prisoners should emerge from long sentences with exceptional
  interpersonal skills, which is rarely the case. The rise in school refusal
  should not be seen as a crisis of children’s resilience but as a warning sign
  that our educational model requires urgent reform. A hybrid approach –
  part-time attendance combined with home-based learning, supported by
  technology – would reduce pressure, foster autonomy and provide a healthier
  balance between structure and freedom. Denis McVey Oundle, Northamptonshire •
