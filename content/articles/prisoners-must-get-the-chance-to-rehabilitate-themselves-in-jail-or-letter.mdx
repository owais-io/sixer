  As a former prison governor, I welcome the revival of “time off for good
  behaviour”, familiar to us in the 1980s (Labour to abolish most short prison
  sentences in England and Wales, 24 August). But for it to succeed, prisoners
  must have the chance to show positivity and a will to change. At present, too
  many are locked in conditions that amount to solitary confinement, with
  illicit drugs as their main form of relief. Such a regime means that only
  those who are already motivated – or organised criminals running their empires
  from inside – can benefit. For the rest, the system offers little more than
  stagnation. Worse still, a failing Prison Service is shifting the burden on to
  a demoralised probation workforce. The result is soaring recalls, now at the
  equivalent of eight new prisons – each costing around £400m. Unless we create
  real opportunities for rehabilitation inside prisons, this reform risks being
  yet another sticking plaster on a system in long-term crisis. John Podmore

  consultant on prison corruption
