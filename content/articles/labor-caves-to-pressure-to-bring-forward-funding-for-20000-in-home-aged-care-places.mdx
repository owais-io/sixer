  Labor will bring forward 20,000 in-home aged care funding places in the next
  eight weeks, caving to demands from the Senate crossbench and the Coalition
  and moving to avoid a further defeat on surging wait lists. The Albanese
  government delayed introduction of its new in-home care system from 1 July
  this year, despite more than 87,000 elderly people already being approved and
  waiting for care. The new scheme and broad changes to care for elderly
  Australians, will begin on 1 November. But the combined force of the
  opposition, the Greens and ACT independent David Pocock were set to hand Labor
  its first major defeat since the May election this week, until the health
  minister, Mark Butler, and the aged care minister, Sam Rae, backed down on
  Wednesday. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The government agreed to support a
  motion from Coalition aged care spokesperson, Anne Ruston, to roll out the
  20,000 new packages before November. Labor refused to support motions from the
  Greens and Pocock, whose amendment requiring 20,000 additional places passed
  the Senate earlier in the day. Consideration of Labor’s own legislation was
  repeatedly pushed back in the Senate as the government sought to avoid defeat.
  About 121,000 people are waiting for an assessment, while 108,000 are waiting
  for a package. “We had to drag the government kicking and screaming, but after
  losing a vote in the Senate we have finally forced them to do the right thing
  by older people,” Greens spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said. “Senior
  ministers have had to step in and clean up the mess made by Sam Rae. Labor was
  too arrogant to make changes themselves, which is why we have united to force
  them to do the right thing by older people.” Australia’s ageing population is
  pushing the aged care system to the limits. The country is on track for a
  doubling of people over 65 and a tripling of those aged over 85 within 40
  years. Butler defended the government’s tactics, insisting Labor wanted to
  make a deal with the Coalition, rather than engage with the Greens or the
  crossbench. “We’ve been considering our position, and we have said the bill
  needs to pass before the end of this week,” he said. The Coalition claimed the
  backdown as a victory. Ruston said she was surprised by the announcement of an
  extra 20,000 places only hours after Labor had voted against a similar plan.
  “I think there was quite a lot of confusion, and clearly a bit of a backflip
  that occurred … because the Labor party absolutely put on the record that they
  voted against the release of 20,000 home care packages.” Pocock criticised the
  government for cutting out the crossbench to make a deal with the Coalition.
  “It’s disappointing, but not surprising,” he said. Nearly 5,000 Australians
  died last financial year while waiting for the correct level of home care,
  according to data from the department of health released last week. One of
  those was Boris Gutkovich, the father of Diana Horvatovic, the chief executive
  of aged care provider St Basil’s. The organisation operates residential care
  and home care in Sydney and Canberra. Gutkovich died in hospital at the end of
  February, unable to safely be discharged to his home because he was still
  waiting on his level four support package, which he had been approved for, to
  come through. The level four support package would have helped Gutkovich with
  showering, dressing and other mobility needs. “Because he was unable to be
  safely cared for at home … because the package wasn’t available, they were
  then looking at placing him into a residential setting,” Horvatovic told
  Guardian Australia. “Look, it was heartbreaking. I was no longer the
  professional, I was the child supporting my parents - both my dad who was the
  one that was actually physically sick and deteriorating and unable to come
  home … and also watching my mother who was unable to comprehend how the system
  was failing her.”
