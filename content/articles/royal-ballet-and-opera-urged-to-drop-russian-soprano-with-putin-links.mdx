  More than 50 Ukrainian writers and artists, a cross-party group of UK MPs, and
  a former New Zealand prime minister have urged the Royal Ballet and Opera to
  drop the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko from its new London season.
  Netrebko is due to perform in the RBO’s production of Tosca next month. In a
  letter to the Guardian, the signatories describe her as a “longtime symbol of
  cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”.
  They suggest the RBO has put itself on the wrong side of history by inviting
  Netrebko to perform in title roles at a time when Russia has escalated its
  attacks “on peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilians” and is trying
  systematically to erase Ukrainian culture. “The Royal Opera now faces a
  defining choice: between status and responsibility, between profit and values,
  between silence and conscience. We urge you to remain, as you consistently
  have, on the ethical side of art – and of history,” the letter adds.
  Signatories include the Ukrainian novelists Andriy Kurkov and Serhiy Zhadan,
  the Oscar-winning film-maker Mstyslav Chernov and the chef and author Olia
  Hercules. The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark has also backed
  the letter along with a group of MPs, and the French intellectual
  Bernard-Henri Lévy. The Royal Opera House and Netrebko declined to comment.
  Earlier this month the RBO pulled its production of Tosca at the Israeli Opera
  in Tel Aviv after almost 200 Royal Opera and Ballet members signed an open
  letter criticising the organisation’s stance on Gaza. The RBO’s chief
  executive, Alex Beard, explaining his decision, denied accusations of double
  standards, after the opera house confiscated a Palestinian flag in July from a
  performer. In 2022 it showed the Ukrainian flag as a symbol of solidarity
  after Moscow’s full-scale invasion. Beard said last week: “Our support for
  Ukraine was aligned with the global consensus at the time. As the world’s
  geopolitics have become more complex, our stance has changed to ensure that
  our actions reflect our purpose and values.” The Labour MP Alex Sobel, chair
  of the parliamentary all-party group on Ukraine, said he was “deeply troubled”
  by the RBO’s invitation to Netrebko and its apparent reduction in support for
  Kyiv. “You can’t explain it as ‘complex geopolitics’. It’s not complex. It’s
  simple. Don’t invite Russian supporters of the regime to perform. Ukraine is
  fighting for all our freedoms. This is adding insult to injury,” Sobel said.
  The Conservative MP John Whittingdale and the Labour MP Emily Thornberry have
  met Beard privately to discuss Netrebko’s participation in the 2025-26 season,
  and have also written to him about it. “Anna Netrebko may be a fine soprano
  but she has previously shown support for Russian separatists in Ukraine and
  has said nothing to condemn Russian brutality since a single statement over
  three years ago,” Whittingdale said. The MP added: “I am sorry that the Royal
  Opera House has reversed its position by inviting her to perform, and hope at
  the very least that she will make clear her condemnation of Putin and his
  regime before taking the stage in London.” Ukraine’s first deputy foreign
  minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, who organised the letter, said the ROB should
  replace her with a singer “not associated with a criminal regime”. Netrebko is
  one of the world’s best-known sopranos who draws full houses for her
  performances at leading opera houses globally. She made her name at the
  Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg, whose director, Valery Gergiev, is an
  ardent supporter of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. In 2014 Netrebko made
  a donation to Donetsk’s opera house after Russia seized the city as part of
  its covert armed takeover of parts of eastern Ukraine. She was photographed
  holding the separatist flag of “Novorossiya” with a pro-Kremlin former
  Ukrainian politician, later saying she did not understand what the flag meant.
  The Guardian letter asked: “Can the Opera credibly claim neutrality and
  integrity while offering its stage to someone who, in 2014, publicly waved the
  flag of ‘Novorossiya’, the Kremlin’s separatist project in Ukraine’s Donetsk
  region, parts of which remain under Russian military occupation?” A longtime
  Austrian citizen and resident, Netrebko issued a statement in March 2022
  condemning the war in Ukraine. “My thoughts are with the victims of this war
  and their families,” she posted on Facebook, saying she was not a member of a
  political party nor “allied with any leader of Russia”. “I acknowledge and
  regret that past actions or statements of mine could have been
  misinterpreted,” she added, saying she had met Putin “only a handful of times”
  at awards ceremonies and the Olympics. “I love my homeland of Russia and only
  seek peace and unity through my art,” she wrote. Her general manager, Miguel
  Esteban, said Netrebko had “never shown support for Russian separatists” and
  had condemned the war in three social media statements and two interviews. She
  had not returned to Russia since the full-scale invasion, he added. Netrebko
  has carefully avoided directly criticising the Russian president, who in 2008
  gave her the honorary title of “people’s artist”. In March 2022 the
  Metropolitan Opera in New York cited her failure to condemn Putin for its
  decision to drop her from a run of Turandot, with her role given to a
  Ukrainian artist. Other invitations dried up. She has subsequently made a
  comeback, appearing at the Vienna State Opera and singing to a full house at
  La Scala in Milan. She is scheduled to perform for four nights at the Royal
  Opera House in Covent Garden from 11 September, with another appearance in
  December, starring in Turandot. • This article was amended on 14 and 15 August
  2025 to add a comment from Anna Netrebko’s manager, Miguel Esteban, that was
  received after publication, and to reflect his position that while Netrebko
  was pictured in 2014 with the pro-Kremlin former Ukrainian politician Oleg
  Tsaryov, this did not constitute a formal “meeting”.
