  Kansas City Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice has accepted a six-game NFL ban for
  his part in a high-speed crash that left a number of people injured. The
  25-year-old pled guilty in July to two third-degree felony charges of
  collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing
  bodily injury. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and was required to pay
  $115,000 in medical costs to the injured parties. The incident took place on a
  Dallas highway in March 2024. Prosecutors say Rice was driving a Lamborghini
  Urus SUV at 119mph when he made “multiple aggressive maneuvers around traffic”
  and struck other vehicles. Rice said in a statement at the time of his plea
  deal that: “I am profoundly sorry for the physical damages to person and
  property. I fully apologize for the harm I caused to innocent drivers and
  their families.” The NFL handed down its suspension after its own internal
  investigation, one week before the Chiefs are due to leave for Brazil, where
  they will play the Los Angeles Chargers in their season opener. Along with
  missing the Chargers game, Rice will miss a rematch of last season’s Super
  Bowl with the Eagles on 14 September at Arrowhead Stadium; a Sunday night trip
  to New York to face the Giants; a high-profile matchup with Lamar Jackson and
  the Ravens on 28 September; a game against Jacksonville the following Monday
  night; and a Sunday night showdown with the Lions. Rice will be eligible to
  return to the field when Kansas City faces the AFC West-rival Raiders on 19
  October. The Chiefs selected Rice in the second-round of the 2023 draft. He
  won the Super Bowl in his first season with the team, catching six passes for
  39 yards in Kansas City’s victory over the San Francisco 49ers.
