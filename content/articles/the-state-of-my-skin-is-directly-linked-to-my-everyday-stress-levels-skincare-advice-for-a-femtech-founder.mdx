  “I’m the founder and CEO of Propelle and our mission is to financially empower
  women – helping them to become more confident with their money and investing.
  Typically women don’t invest at anywhere near the levels they should. One of
  the primary drivers is lack of confidence, so the purpose of the platform is
  to help women overcome that. Everything we do is about getting women to take
  action. My life is a bit insane. I have two young kids – aged eight and three
  – so the morning is usually spent getting them up and ready. We have a nanny
  who comes in to help and we generally split the work – she’ll look after one
  kid, I’ll look after the other and we’ll each take one to school. When I get
  back home, I jump into emails. I get 100-200 a day so if I don’t start going
  through them, it becomes very overwhelming. We have a hybrid work situation at
  Propelle – mainly we work from home, but we do have regular office days. It’s
  important in terms of building culture and cementing the team. If I’m out and
  about or going off to the office, I wear sunscreen, a hat with a visor,
  sunglasses, everything – to protect my face. I never used to bother with
  sunscreen. I was like, I’m black, why do I need it? But now I know that you
  absolutely do. Growing up as a black person, that’s something we’re not told.
  I hate makeup, so I only wear it if I’m going out. My skin is dry but produces
  excess oil, so I might have two hours before I’m shining. I’m not a fan. I
  don’t have time to do my makeup properly. The thing that gets me is that men
  don’t have to wear it. No one treats them any differently, so why should women
  be treated differently [if they don’t wear makeup]?” Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme Dr
  Ejikeme says: “What Ayesha describes points to dehydrated skin that
  overcompensates with oil. Many people confuse this for ‘oily’ skin when, in
  fact, what’s needed is balanced hydration. Adding a product such as Modern
  Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening Moisturiser with vitamin C and niacinamide
  to her routine could reduce the appearance of dark spots and help brighten
  skin while supporting oil-water balance with squalane.” “Before I founded
  Propelle my skin was fine, now it’s in direct correlation to my stress levels.
  Nowadays I’m massively focused on my skincare, maybe because I’m older. I hit
  40 and I had a bit of a panic attack, thinking I needed to start avoiding
  wrinkles. I do have quite a regimented routine. I also go to a clinic every
  month for a facial and a chemical peel. We do the Pico laser. I have an LED
  mask at home and have 10 minutes of red light every evening, which is supposed
  to improve the appearance of skin. Breakouts are my biggest skin concern. When
  I’m very stressed, my skin doesn’t heal properly. I get pimples on my face and
  even on my chest. Then the breakouts lead to pigmentation and you go through
  this cycle. At one point I was struggling to manage the breakouts, so I went
  to the doctor, who asked if I was feeling stressed. I run a fintech startup
  that is regulated. We take retail money. I am a solo founder. I am
  fundraising. I said, “Of course, I’m feeling stressed.” Dr Ejikeme says:
  “Ayesha’s described feeling the effects of everyday stress, which can over a
  long period of time have an impact on the skin. Hormonal changes caused by
  cortisol can also increase sebum production, exacerbating breakouts. In skin
  of colour, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) becomes the longer-term
  challenge, which means that targeting both breakouts and the marks they leave
  is crucial. Reducing everyday stress would be the primary recommendation
  though this is easy to say and hard to do. For the skin, start with Modern
  Chemistry by Boots Glow Exfoliating AHA/BHA Toner, and use it a few times a
  week after cleansing to unclog pores. Follow up with the Modern Chemistry by
  Boots Glow 10% Vitamin C Serum With Ferulic Acid, which is a powerful
  antioxidant.” ‘I want to be able to look back and say: “I made a real
  difference”’ “If it’s a day that I’m working from home, I’ll try to block out
  set hours. At the moment, I’m in the seed fundraising round so I can spend
  hours tweaking the model or the pitch deck, outreach to investors, or on
  investor calls. I’m not so great with lunch, sometimes the day is just back to
  back. I pick up my daughters from school and then I might take them swimming –
  the schedule’s different every day. When we get back home, the nanny looks
  after them while I get back to work. Then l’ll be with my kids from 7pm, when
  the nanny leaves, until their bedtime at about 8.30pm. After dinner, I’m
  working again from about 9 till midnight. I try to be asleep by 1am, but
  sometimes I look at my phone and suddenly it’s 2am. I know my sleep is not
  good. It’s something that I need to work on. I’ve been conditioned to not
  sleep. After university, I joined a major investment banking firm and I would
  go into the office at 9am and work till 3am. But now, if I’m not asleep by
  1am, it will be noticeable in my skin. In the morning, there will be deeper
  bags, dark marks, the lines on my face will be more pronounced. Running a
  startup requires so much from you. I don’t think it’s possible to have a
  balance – I don’t think balance exists – but it’s about trying to get as close
  as you can.” Dr Ejikeme says: “Sleep deprivation accelerates skin ageing,
  reduces cellular repair, and impairs collagen synthesis. Poor sleep is also
  closely linked to under-eye darkening and puffiness. The best remedy is rest
  but good skincare and improving skin hygiene can help. Ayshea could start with
  Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening Eye Cream with vitamin C and
  caffeine. This is formulated to reduce the appearance of puffiness and make
  dark circles seem less visible, by using light-diffusing particles to brighten
  the appearance of skin.” “Working in banking felt like I’d got a good job, I
  was super successful to the outside world, I was earning good money, but in
  the grand scheme of things … I had a tiny handful of clients – where is the
  impact? Now, with Propelle, when I’m old and grey and on my deathbed, I want
  to be able to look back and say: ‘I did that. I helped all those people. I
  made a real difference.’ Even if people don’t necessarily remember me, if
  Propelle exists beyond me, I did that.” Ayesha’s Modern Chemistry formula Dr
  Ejikeme’s summary: “Ayesha’s skin is showing signs of stress-related breakouts
  common in high-pressure environments, and dehydration. But her dedication to a
  regular skincare routine, monthly treatments and at-home LED therapy is a
  great foundation. Adding in targeted hydration, brightening actives such as
  vitamin C, and barrier-supporting ingredients such as niacinamide, with the
  Modern Chemistry by Boots range can help even tone, reduce pigmentation and
  restore balance – supporting her skin to better withstand the demands of her
  busy lifestyle.” Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow 10% Vitamin C Serum With
