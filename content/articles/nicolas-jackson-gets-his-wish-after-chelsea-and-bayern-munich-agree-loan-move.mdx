  Nicolas Jackson’s on-off loan move to Bayern Munich has gone ahead after the
  Bundesliga champions finally resolved their tense standoff with Chelsea.
  Jackson was left frustrated after the initial deal collapsed at the weekend
  but his representatives worked to resurrect negotiations and an agreement was
  reached on Monday afternoon for the striker to leave on loan with a
  conditional obligation to buy for €65m (£56.2m). The standoff was caused by
  Chelsea deciding they needed extra cover in attack after Liam Delap sustained
  a hamstring injury against Fulham on Saturday. Jackson had already flown to
  Germany to complete a loan with an option to buy and refused to budge when he
  was told to return to London. The 24-year-old, who has fallen down the pecking
  order following the arrivals of Delap and João Pedro this summer, remained in
  Munich but his hopes of joining Bayern appeared to be over at the end of the
  weekend. Jackson emerged as a possible target for Newcastle when they accepted
  Liverpool’s offer for Alexander Isak on Sunday night, only for that path to
  close when the north-east club agreed to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissa on
  Monday morning. Optimism then rose when it emerged that Bayern were making
  another push for the Senegal international. Chelsea were hopeful for a
  permanent sale but a compromise was reached. Bayern are paying a €16.5m loan
  fee in one chunk and the obligation to buy will be triggered by Jackson making
  a certain number of appearances this season for Vincent Kompany’s team. It was
  a slow deadline day in terms of incomings at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea recalled
  Marc Guiu from his loan at Sunderland to provide cover up front and completed
  a loan deal for the Brighton attacker Facundo Buonanotte. They did not pursue
  interest in Barcelona’s Fermin López. Attempts to find buyers for Raheem
  Sterling, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi were harder. Chilwell agreed a
  permanent move to Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club, on a two-year deal. But
  West Ham were unable to agree a loan for Disasi, the French centre-back, and
  Sterling was left in limbo after interest in him failed to materialise. The
  former England winger has two years left on a deal worth over £325,000 a week.
