  Philip Inman takes a very London-centric view (Can a nation in crisis rely on
  the baby boomer generation to step up? I think the UK is about to find out, 21
  August). Certainly in my small northern town, retirees haven’t had a financial
  bonanza from property price hikes. Also in my part of the world services that
  used to be provided by local authorities are now largely undertaken by an army
  of older people, including litterpicking, gardening in communal areas, local
  radio, school holiday activities for children, and food bank collection and
  delivery. Not to mention the myriad charities who couldn’t provide services
  without the time given by retirees. At the moment older people are reluctant
  to move into the housing provided by some private developers, as this can
  leave a financial headache for their children when they die. Perhaps this is
  an area where Inman could usefully focus his journalistic zeal rather than
  scapegoating older people. This sort of reporting, which takes the experience
  of a small subset of the population and extrapolates that to a whole
  generation, is intrinsically flawed. Dr Susan Graves Lydiate, Merseyside •
  Philip Inman appears to be out of touch with many baby boomers’ lived
  experiences. We tried to move from our three-bedroom detached home several
  years ago without success; none of our viewers were young families. They were
  couples our age seeking to downsize. We spent many weeks trying to find a
  suitable home, but were dismayed at poor-quality building, rabbit-hutch-sized
  gardens and tiny rooms, and huge, faceless estates without transport or
  facilities. We decided there was no point in reducing our circumstances as
  well as paying stamp duty and hefty removal costs. We have lived here for
  nearly 30 years, we support village activities, local campaigns and local
  politics, and yes, we enjoy our holidays, but they are by no means all
  jet-setting. We have certainly, as many of our generation have, given back in
  time and money. This blame game serves no useful purpose. Christine Hey
  Nottingham • I’d like to downsize. But houses in town, where activities and
  facilities are located, are more highly priced than where I am, 1.5 miles out
  of town. And there aren’t that many of them. I don’t want to live too close to
  the town centre – it’s noisy at night. If volume builders talked to us, maybe
  they would provide the houses for us. But we are ignored. At 72, I’m not ready
  for a sheltered flat with carers provided. So, Mr Inman, you sort the problem
  with the builders. They might listen to you. On the other hand, perhaps a chat
  with boomers might help you. I recommend contacting a National Women’s
  Register group (previously National Housewives Register, set up following a
  letter to this paper). The ladies would welcome you for a lively discussion.
  Likewise, the University of the Third Age, a self-help group for older people.
  Just don’t get us started on how frugal we were in our younger days or on how
  much volunteering many of us do. Judy Windwood Wimborne, Dorset • Phillip
  Inman urges older people to move out of their three-bedroom houses and he’s
  right, of course, but as a couple (79 and 82) in the middle of doing that, I
  understand why more don’t. Luckily our house sale went smoothly, but the whole
  process is still exhausting, frustrating and sometimes worrying. There are the
  repeated trips to the tip and charity shops; trying to find out why the flat
  you are moving to is the only one in the block listed as not having full fibre
  broadband; trying to end a landline contract with a company that employs a
  machine to read the documents you send it, only to reject them because its
  machine can’t read them; trying to explain that you haven’t got your new
  address on your driving licence because you can’t change the address on your
  driving licence until you have actually moved; discovering that your
  once-expensive Georgian and Victorian furniture is worth almost nothing … and
  all this while navigating the usual hospital appointments etc, and cleaning
  bits of your house you haven’t cleaned for years. I’m sure it will be worth it
  if we make it to moving day without murdering each other or jumping off the
  Suspension Bridge, but I can understand why others can’t face it and just stay
  put. Rosemary Chamberlin Bristol • Not all of us boomers are lounging around
  in half-empty houses, ruminating on our next vacation. As a 70-year-old still
  in full-time freelance work, I, and my wife, share a five-bedroom house in
  south-east London that now sleeps seven. Both our children have moved back,
  along with three of their friends. All five pay a rent that helps us to afford
  the rocketing utilities, but also that enables them to live in London. If we
  downsized, that would throw five people on to a rental market they could not
  afford on their current salaries. And that’s if they could find anywhere; the
  reason they’re back living with us is precisely because they can’t. And we
  also seem to enjoy each other’s company. So if that isn’t stepping up, I don’t
  know what is. Peter Grimsdale Dulwich, London
