  It’s quite a schlep from Buckingham Palace to the mean streets of
  working-class Portland, Oregon, but it is one that Midlands-born film-maker
  Benjamin Caron and actor Vanessa Kirby have undertaken with their new thriller
  Night Always Comes, adapted from the taut novel by Willy Vlautin. Caron and
  Kirby met nearly a decade ago when he directed episodes of The Crown, in which
  she played the young Princess Margaret from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke.
  Now Kirby stars as a former sex worker called Lynette, toiling in multiple
  jobs and living with her disabled brother (Zach Gottsagen) and their wrecked,
  wayward mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They have cobbled together the funds to
  buy their dilapidated house at a snip, only for Lynette’s mother to recklessly
  blow her half on a new car. Cue one manic night in which Lynette must make
  back the dough, by fair means or foul, or else be turfed out on to the
  streets. Caron cites the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems and Good Time as an
  influence on his picture’s breakneck momentum. But, along with films such as
  Late Shift, On Falling and the forthcoming Urchin, Night Always Comes surely
  belongs to a wave of neo-realism that reflects our ongoing cost of living
  crisis. “The idea that you can work three jobs and still not be able to afford
  your own home is a universal modern tragedy,” says the affable 49-year-old
  director. “Lynette’s story represents millions of people who are just one or
  two pay-cheques away from collapse. Of course, the film is in the thriller
  genre but I also wanted to get across the idea that nurses or caregivers or
  whoever are being priced out of the very cities that they help to keep
  running.” The situation first struck him during a visit to Los Angeles. “I
  remember being genuinely shocked by seeing the homeless crisis there. People
  are like: ‘Oh, they must be drug addicts.’ It’s very easy to throw labels like
  that around. But they can’t all be addicts. People are not just falling into
  homelessness: they’re being pushed.” Wealthy characters in Night Always Comes,
  such as the client who recoils in disgust when Lynette tells him of her
  straitened circumstances, are naturally insulated from economic turbulence.
  This is a film where it’s poor versus poor all the way, and kindness is in
  short supply. “It’s a cliche,” says Caron, “but desperate people do desperate
  things. And the film is full of desperate people. Everyone has their reasons
  for doing what they do.” Kirby is in every scene, her vitality and desperation
  propelling the movie in much the same way as, say, Gena Rowlands in Gloria or
  Mikey Madison in Anora. As Lynette, she lies and schemes, steals a car, loots
  a safe, and isn’t above taking the nearest blunt instrument to anyone who
  crosses her. “Being back with Vanessa was like reuniting with a dance
  partner,” says Caron, with a smile. “It’s been a while but you still know the
  moves.” Actors bring baggage, however. The casting of Kirby – privately
  educated and so often labelled “posh” that she has even moaned about it in
  interviews – as a traumatised, penniless sex worker, appears to plunge the
  film into the territory of Frankie and Johnny, which starred Michelle Pfeiffer
  as a dowdy, unremarkable waitress. “You’re absolutely right,” Caron says,
  “but, as an actor, you want to avoid being pigeonholed. The more you can jump
  off the cliff, the wider range of offers you’ll get. Vanessa has this
  unpredictable energy. There’s no safety net with her, no filter. She makes
  these wild decisions in real time, in the middle of everything.” Don’t forget,
  he says, that even The Crown looked risky to begin with. “There was a moment
  before it went out where we were all like: ‘Is anyone going to watch this?’”
  Similar jitters surrounded another streaming hit that became one of Caron’s
  springboards into cinema: Andor, the gritty Star Wars spin-off that revived
  interest in the franchise just as Disney was in the final stages of flogging a
  dead Wookiee. One outwardly unorthodox choice by Andor’s writer and
  show-runner Tony Gilroy was to put Caron, a self-confessed lapsed Star Wars
  fan, in charge of several episodes, including the first season’s finale. The
  lack of reverence that Caron brought to George Lucas’s universe might have
  been one of the keys to the show’s excellence. “You can get too drawn into
  trying to please the fans,” he says. “That’s a dangerous trap.” Caron became a
  safe pair of hands in the television world – he cut his teeth on the likes of
  Scott &amp; Bailey, Skins and Wallander, and also directed the final episode
  of Sherlock – but he says making movies was always the endgame. His 2023
  debut, Sharper, a deliciously slippery thriller starring Julianne Moore, spent
  just a week in US cinemas before streaming globally on Apple TV+. As a Netflix
  production, Night Always Comes will likewise have only the merest brush with
  the big screen. This can’t be what he has been dreaming of all these years.
  “Oh Ryan!” he cries, throwing his hands up. “That’s so sad! Don’t say that.
  Look, I remember in the 1980s and 90s, you’d hear about a film in America and
  it would take six months until it reached the UK. There was this feverish
  anticipation: fomo, really. And it’s true that doesn’t exist in the same way.
  But I’m a romantic. I like to think the world sort of had a stroke during
  Covid, and everyone retreated into their rooms and drew the curtains. Slowly,
  they’ve been coming back, blinking into the daylight. Look at Barbie and
  Oppenheimer. Those are moments when the audience feels that connection of
  sitting in a cinema and having a shared experience. For those two hours, you
  can be sucked into this portal and taken on a journey. Whereas, at home,
  you’re always going to be distracted.” Perhaps the message, then, is: death to
  Netflix? “No, I love Netflix,” he says. “They changed my career: I owe so much
  to those guys. With The Crown, I was working with the budget of a mid-sized
  movie, with actors who would normally be in films. And people have bigger
  screens now; it’s not like in the 1980s. No director would say they wouldn’t
  love viewers to sit in the cinema and watch what they’ve made. But you also
  want lots of people to see your work. And, hopefully, a few million might
  watch it.” In Caron’s case, it seems, Netflix always comes to the rescue. •
  Night Always Comes is on Netflix from 15 August.
