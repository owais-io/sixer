  Many thanks to the readers who put in freedom of information requests to
  obtain unredacted copies of July’s Genius puzzle, which appeared in truncated
  form due to a D notice. Our investigations team has pieced these together to
  create a document that we believe is the closest to what the crossword would
  have looked like had it been published uncensored although some infelicities
  remain, including inconsistent italicisation. The pdf is here and the solution
  grid can be seen below. And thank you for your clues for WATERING CAN. For the
  record, spoonerisms are here treated as movements of sounds, not of text. The
  sounds are often odd, as we’ve explored in our Meet the letter interviews. For
  example, “quartering Anne” moves the sounds of WATERING CAN around in a
  Spooner-like fashion (as well as ending up with a plausible if grisly regal
  phrase). So does “cautering wan”, but sadly at the cost of sense. The
  runners-up are AmusingJay’s helpful “Wanting acer to flourish?” and
  GappyTooth’s cryptic definition “One in the nursery that wets the bed”; the
  winner is “Might this help ground wanting care?” Kludos to Croquem; please
  leave entries for REDACTED below, along with any favourite clues or puzzles
  you have spotted. As mentioned last week, updates will now appear after each
  Genius deadline and any time there is breaking crossword news. • 188 Words for
  Rain by Alan Connor is published by Ebury (£16.99). To support the Guardian,
  order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.
