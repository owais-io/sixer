  The District of Columbia carried out its last execution in 1957. That April,
  it put Robert Eugene Carter to death for killing a police officer as Carter
  tried to flee a robbery he had just committed. At the time, the law in the
  nation’s capital made the death penalty mandatory for first-degree murders of
  the kind Carter committed. He died in the electric chair. If Donald Trump has
  his way it won’t be long before Washington DC sees a return of capital
  punishment. During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the president promised to
  bring it back. He said: “If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington
  DC, we’re going to be seeking the death penalty.” This comment was almost an
  aside in the midst of a conversation about selling government buildings to
  private real estate developers who, he said, would get rich when he finished
  making Washington a “crime free city”. “By the way, speaking of that,” the
  president continued as if his memory was triggered by talk of ridding
  Washington of crime. “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital
  punishment, capital, capital punishment,” he repeated as if soullessly
  enjoying the wordplay on a deadly serious subject. “That’s a very strong
  preventative,” he claimed, ignoring the mountain of evidence pointing to the
  fact that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. He mused that the
  country might not be “ready for it”, but that asserted “we have no choice”.
  And with typical Trump flourish he insisted that “everybody that’s heard it
  agrees with it”, though it was not clear what he was referencing, capital
  punishment or its supposed preventive power. The president’s promise that all
  murderers would get the death penalty in DC runs afoul of longstanding supreme
  court precedent that says death sentences can never be mandatory. Moreover, it
  plays into the complex racial politics that always attaches to the uses of
  capital punishment in the United States. Before saying more about both of
  those issues, let’s look at the history of the death penalty in the District
  of Columbia. According to the Death Penalty Information Center: “The first
  recorded execution in Washington, D.C. was the hanging of James McGirk in
  1802.” McGirk killed his pregnant wife and the twins she was carrying. His
  Irish heritage was at the forefront of public discussion of his crime and the
  way it should be punished. One newspaper highlighted the fact that McGirk “was
  neither born nor educated in America”. It asked: “How long can we expect our
  native youth to remain uncontaminated”? In 1865, Mary Surratt, who conspired
  to assassinate president Abraham Lincoln, was hanged in the District. And
  another presidential assassin, Charles Guiteau, was put to death there in 1882
  for killing president James Garfield. All told, from McGirk to Carter, 118
  people were executed in Washington by civilian or military authorities. Not
  surprisingly, race played a key role in that history. After 1962, the death
  penalty was no longer a mandatory punishment for murder in the city. And in
  1981, the city council abolished capital punishment entirely, a decision
  ratified by the votes a decade later. But the preference of the voters does
  not seem to trouble the president. In this case, he doesn’t need to worry
  about that because of DC’s status and the federal government’s oversight of
  it. That means that the US attorney’s office, under the supervision of the
  Department of Justice, not local officials, would be in charge of turning the
  president’s plan into reality. And no one should be surprised that the
  president wants the death penalty to be part of his plan to rid Washington DC
  of crime. On the first day of his second term, he issued an executive order
  directing the attorney general to “pursue the death penalty for all crimes of
  a severity demanding its use”. Does that mean all murders and all murderers?
  In 1976, the supreme court made clear that it did not think so. The court
  struck down a North Carolina statute that made the death penalty mandatory for
  first-degree murder. What justice Potter Stewart said in that case is
  particularly instructive as we consider what Trump discussed on Tuesday. “The
  history of mandatory death penalty statutes in the United States,” Stewart
  wrote, “reveals that the practice of sentencing to death all persons convicted
  of a particular offense has been rejected as unduly harsh and unworkably
  rigid. The two crucial indicators of evolving standards of decency respecting
  the imposition of punishment in our society – jury determinations and
  legislative enactment – both point conclusively to the repudiation of
  automatic death sentences.” Stewart explained: “At least since the Revolution,
  American jurors have, with some regularity, disregarded their oaths and
  refused to convict defendants where a death sentence was the automatic
  consequence of a guilty verdict … Nineteenth century journalists, statesmen,
  and jurists repeatedly observed that jurors were often deterred from
  convicting palpably guilty men of first-degree murder under mandatory
  statutes.” And he highlighted the District of Columbia’s 1962 rejection of
  mandatory death sentences as an important indicator of “contemporary standards
  of decency”. Because of its severity and gravity, death sentencing must,
  Stewart said, “allow the particularized consideration of relevant aspects of
  the character and record of each convicted defendant before the imposition
  upon him of a sentence of death”. Respect for such constitutional niceties has
  never been the president’s strong suit, especially when it would get in the
  way of a policy he wants to pursue. Beyond its patently unconstitutionality,
  restoring capital punishment for everyone who commits murder in Washington DC
  would mean bringing back one of this country’s most racist practices to a
  place where more than 40% of the residents are Black people. We know that race
  plays a role at every stage of the capital punishment process. Black
  defendants are more likely to be charged with capital offenses and to receive
  death sentences than are white people, especially when the people murdered
  were themselves white. But the racial effects don’t stop there. Black people
  sentenced to death are more likely to be chosen for execution and to have
  their executions botched. Trump may not know those particulars, but he very
  likely knows how the death penalty sits with many Black people. As the
  criminologist James Unnever and his colleagues note: “There is a clear racial
  divide in support for the death penalty, with whites favoring and Blacks
  opposing this sanction. This divide has persisted for decades and remains
  statistically and substantively significant even when controls are introduced
  for the known correlates of death penalty attitudes. “A meaningful portion of
  this chasm is explained, however, by racism, with whites who manifest animus
  to blacks being more likely to embrace the lethal punishment of offenders.” If
  federalizing law enforcement and putting armed soldiers on the streets of
  Washington DC sent a powerful signal of white dominance in a city with a
  substantial Black population, Trump’s words about the death penalty reinforced
  that message. When the time comes, it will be up to the courts to defend the
  supreme court’s precedent on mandatory death sentences and to put a stop to
  the racial politics that restoring it to DC would represent. In the meantime,
  it is well worth remembering that the last person executed there was a
  28-year-old Black man who killed a white police officer and was subject to a
  mandatory death penalty. Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of
  jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or
  editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched
  Executions and America’s Death Penalty
