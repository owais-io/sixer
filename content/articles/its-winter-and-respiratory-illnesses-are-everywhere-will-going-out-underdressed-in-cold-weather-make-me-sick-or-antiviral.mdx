  It was inevitable that I would, as Oscar Wilde quipped, become like my mother.
  After decades of being told to “Put on more clothes! You’ll catch a cold!” I
  now, despite knowing better, insist the same for my daughter. “Another layer!”
  I demand of my partner, who begrudgingly bundles up a toddler already as puffy
  as the Michelin Man. The scientifically literate part of my brain understands
  that no jacket will shield her from the onslaught of daycare viruses. And yet
  I cling to the conviction that underdressing or stepping out the door with wet
  hair in winter must be avoided at all costs. Are the cries about catching
  one’s death just old wives’ tales passed down like family heirlooms, or is
  there a hint of truth in the warnings? Old wives’ tale or hint of truth?
  “People get more colds when the weather is cold,” says Hassan Vally, an
  associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin University. “It’s a very natural
  thing for humans to look for patterns,” he adds, but points out that
  correlation is not causation. “You’re not going to catch a cold by just going
  out in the cold,” says Dr Larisa Labzin of the University of Queensland’s
  Institute for Molecular Bioscience. To develop cold symptoms, you need to be
  infected by a virus, whether that be one of the rhinoviruses, coronaviruses,
  adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus or any other of the more than 200
  strains that cause the common cold. Though the flu may present with similar
  symptoms, influenza viruses can cause much more severe disease. Labzin says
  the weather does have a substantial impact on the spread of these viruses.
  “Humidity really drops a lot in the winter – it gets really dry, your skin
  gets really dry – and that actually helps the viruses.” Moisture in the air
  hinders the airborne transmission of viruses, which means if “there’s low
  humidity and someone around you has the flu, it is going to transmit better at
  a further distance”, Labzin says. Respiratory illnesses peak in winter in
  temperate regions but Vally points out that the tropics – where temperatures
  vary less year-round – don’t experience the same seasonal spikes. The rainy
  season in many tropical areas has been linked to greater activity of influenza
  and RSV – which may seem counterintuitive as ambient humidity is higher then.
  One hypothesis that may explain both winter epidemics in temperate regions and
  rainy season outbreaks in the tropics is behavioural: people spend more time
  indoors to avoid the cold and wet. “Cooler temperatures certainly encourage
  people to gather indoors which increases transmission,” Prof Nathan Bartlett
  of the University of Newcastle says. A cold day keeps us inside for about one
  to two hours more on average, and rainy weather 30 minutes more, according to
  one estimate. Colder temperatures and immunity Though being cold won’t
  necessarily result in catching a cold, there is evidence that chillier
  temperatures affect immunity, Vally says. “Not only is there more opportunity
  to catch a virus, but our immune response is also a bit diminished,” Labzin
  agrees. “Cooler, dryer air allows viruses to be transmitted more efficiently
  and suppresses innate immune defences in the nasal passages – which is where
  these viruses get in,” Bartlett says. In dry winter weather, the mucus lining
  our airways – which plays an important role in trapping noxious inhaled
  substances – becomes thicker, making it more difficult for hair-like cells in
  the airways to remove trapped particles and pathogens. Less exposure to
  sunlight – necessary for our skin to produce vitamin D – in the colder months
  may also have an impact on immunity. “There is evidence that vitamin D
  deficiency is a risk factor for increased respiratory infections during
  winter,” Bartlett says. While a systematic review – the strongest form of
  scientific evidence – has found vitamin D supplements can help protect against
  respiratory infections, other findings suggest that supplementation is
  “unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect” in Australia, given that
  severe deficiency is not common here. Cold exposure can also be a physical
  stressor. “Whenever your body is under stress you can get transient
  suppression of your immune responses,” Vally says. “If you’re in -20C without
  a coat, your body is going to be hugely stressed, just like it would be hugely
  stressed if it ran a marathon.” Paradoxically, some small studies have found
  the stress of repeated cold water exposure activates the immune system
  slightly, suggesting the bodies of habitual winter swimmers develop adaptive
  changes. Ultimately, catching a cold results from a “complex interaction
  between virus, host and environment”, Bartlett says. “All three are in a
  constant state of flux – and winter coincides with changes in all of these
  factors.” How to avoid winter lurgies “For flu, for Covid, there are obviously
  vaccines available,” Labzin says, noting that an RSV jab is now recommended
  for immunocompromised groups. “The best protection … is getting vaccinated.”
  Flu vaccination rates in Australia, across all age groups, are significantly
  down from 2020 figures. “It’s important for people to not take antibiotics for
  a viral infection, because antibiotics won’t do anything,” Labzin says, citing
  the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance. Minimising transmission by
  practising good hygiene, wearing a respirator mask and staying home while sick
  is familiar to most from the Covid pandemic – and the same advice applies to
  the common cold. • Donna Lu is an assistant news editor at Guardian Australia
