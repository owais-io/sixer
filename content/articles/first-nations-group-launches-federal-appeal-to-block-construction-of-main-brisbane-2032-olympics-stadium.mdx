  A First Nations group has applied to halt construction of the main stadium
  planned for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. The state and federal governments plan
  to spend $3.8bn on a 63,000-seat stadium at Victoria Park in inner-city
  Brisbane. It will host the opening and closing ceremonies and athletics
  events. The park will also contain a 25,000-seat national aquatic centre, a
  warmup track, and other infrastructure. Victoria Park is one of the most
  significant Indigenous sites in inner-city Brisbane, according to historian
  Ray Kerkhove. It served as the town camp for up to 1,500 Indigenous people,
  who were victims of at least one massacre, and is on a songline, he said
  earlier this year. It is also known as Barrambin. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email In May Queensland parliament passed legislation on party lines exempting
  Games-related development from a number of state planning laws, including the
  Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act, and from legal challenge. On Tuesday, the
  Yagara Magandjin Aboriginal Corporation (Ymac) lodged an application with the
  federal government for permanent legal protection of the park, under section
  10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. The
  decision lies with the federal environment minister, Murray Watt. “We know
  this is a place of great significance and history, not only for Yagara people,
  but for other First Nations and non-Aboriginal people as well,” said Ymac
  spokesperson and Yagarabul elder Gaja Kerry Charlton. The LNP leader, David
  Crisafulli, had promised not to build any new stadiums for the Olympics, and
  not to build one in Victoria Park, before last year’s state election. It was
  also not mentioned during the May federal election campaign. Crisafulli
  apologised for breaking the election promise in March, saying the choice was
  between Victoria Park and a temporary facility in the city’s south that
  wouldn’t have proven suitable. Used as a golf course since 1931, Brisbane city
  council developed a master plan for the site in 2020, converting it back into
  a park. Local elders participated in a four-year consultation process for the
  scheme. The plan has been scrapped. Part of the park is heritage listed and
  the relevant department recommended in April that the protection be expanded
  to cover the entire area. May’s legislation exempts Olympics development from
  the state Heritage Act. “It was a complete shock when the premier came out
  with his stadium plans,” Charlton said. “He said the park would be protected
  from stadiums; I thought the park was safe. Now the government wants to
  destroy it. We are very concerned there are ancient trees, artefacts and very
  important ecosystems existing there. There may be ancestral remains. “We stand
  resolute in our responsibility to protect it.” The federal government threw
  its support behind the Olympic stadium plan last month, on condition that
  appropriate consultation was undertaken with stakeholders including First
  Nations groups. Federal infrastructure minister, Catherine King, was contacted
  for comment. A spokesperson for the state government said its new laws
  “provide a bespoke process that recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait
  Islander cultural heritage matters, incorporating engagement and consultation
  with relevant parties and preparation of a cultural heritage management plan”.
  “Once Victoria Park is gone, it’s gone forever,” Yagara elder Uncle Steven
  said. “Will photos be our only memory? Are we going to have to say to our
  children, our grandchildren: ‘this is what your grandparents experienced, but
  it’s not here for you any more?’ “We have so little left of our history, our
  culture, our social life that we cling to it. And we want to share that with
  non-Aboriginal people as well.” When built, the Victoria Park stadium will be
  Queensland’s biggest stadium and will serve as the home of cricket and the
  Brisbane Lions AFL team.
