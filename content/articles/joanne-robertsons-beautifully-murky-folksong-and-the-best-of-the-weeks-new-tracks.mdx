  From Blackpool, England Recommended if you like Grouper, Sinéad O’Connor, Dean
  Blunt Up next New album Blurr released via AD 93 on 19 September The best of
  the UK underground right now resonates with a dank hum, a grimy, disaffected
  feeling. You don’t need me to tell you why: just listen to Moin, Mark William
  Lewis, Quade or Still House Plants and let the feeling mingle with the deep
  sense of dread already entrenched in your bones. One strand of this sound’s
  DNA can be traced back to Dean Blunt’s warped experimentalism. Anyone attuned
  to the enigmatic London musician’s output is likely already aware of his
  long-term collaborator Joanne Robertson, a fixture on 2021’s Black Metal 2 and
  last year’s Backstage Raver among others. For those outside the Bluntverse,
  she’s likely to go overground this year as the latest tendril from its world,
  her new album Blurr adding folky shades to this invitingly squalid sonic
  scene. Robertson is also a painter, and uses improvisation in both media. “I
  want the works to almost fail,” she once said. “I struggle with conceived
  notions of beauty.” The songs on Blurr hang together like spider webs, her
  blurred and belly-deep acoustic strums seeming to have no beginning or end.
  There’s a blunt weightiness to her playing that might recall the Kentucky
  post-rock scene of the early 90s, which anchors her searching vocals. She has
  a way with unearthing hypnotic pockets of melody; single Gown has something of
  Sinéad O’Connor’s Celtic hymns to it. Moments of sharpness evoke
  confrontational early Cat Power; the softer shades Jessica Pratt’s watercolour
  delivery. Meanwhile, the distance at which she sings brings to mind how
  Grouper’s music feels like following a wraithlike presence through a misty
  forest. Cello by Oliver Coates burnishes this uncanny sound world, one that
  finds unexpected openness and hope in the murk. Laura Snapes This week’s best
  new tracks Snooper – Worldwide Flagbearers for the antic, lo-fi “egg punk”
  sound, the Nashville band return with a Devo-channelling single, frontwoman
  Blair Tramel contorting herself with a series of gymnastic commands. Oren
  Ambarchi / Johan Berthling / Andreas Werliin – Chahar The trio’s terrific
  Ghosted project continues with another of their steadily rhythmic jazz quests,
  this one animated by a killer motif from double bassist Berthling, flexing
  under Werliin’s funky drums and Ambarchi’s fidgety guitar. Nourished By Time –
  Baby Baby The best single yet from the underground US pop star’s upcoming new
  album: he rants against political apathy as new wave washes around 80s R&amp;B
  flourishes and vocal samples in a psychedelic spin cycle. Enny – Cabin Feva
  With the impulsive spirit of slam poetry given the discipline of hip-hop,
  Enny’s flow is always a pleasure. Here, over a spartan jazzy backing, she raps
  about preserving her self-respect amid a power-imbalanced relationship. Rema –
  Kelebu Rather than settle into masses-pleasing middle of the road pop after
  his mega-smash Calm Down, the Nigerian star has been admirably edgy and
  propulsive, and this galloping track is proper pell-mell madness. Witch Fever
  – Fevereaten “God put my weight under his thumb / told me I’d soon become
  undone …” The Manc band’s frontwoman, Amy Walpole, confronts the man upstairs
  with magnificent goth rock that broods then rages. Ondo Fudd – Limelight
  Cerebral but never dull or bookish, the British dance producer Call Super
  resurrects his alter ego for this futurist take on Chicago house, its bassline
  taking on different hues as if passing through pools of coloured light. Ben
