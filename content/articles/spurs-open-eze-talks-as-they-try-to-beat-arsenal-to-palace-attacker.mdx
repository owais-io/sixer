  Tottenham have opened talks over a move for Eberechi Eze, whose £68m release
  clause expires on Friday, and are pushing to beat Arsenal to the Crystal
  Palace attacker. Arsenal have indicated they need to make sales in attack
  before pressing ahead with their pursuit of the England international. The
  delay from Arsenal, who are looking for buyers for Leandro Trossard, has
  opened the door for Spurs to act on their longstanding interest. Thomas Frank,
  the new Spurs manager, needs attacking additions after losing James Maddison
  to a long-term knee injury and missing out on the signing of Nottingham
  Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. They can offer Champions League football to Eze
  after winning the Europa League last season. An agreement is yet to be reached
  and Spurs do not intend to meet Eze’s clause. A further complication for Spurs
  is that Arsenal are believed to be the 27-year-old’s favoured destination
  should he leave Palace. Arsenal, who have bolstered their attack with the
  additions of Viktor Gyökeres and Noni Madueke, have shown ambition this summer
  as they aim to win the title for the first time since 2004. They have spent
  close to £200m and would like to shift unwanted players. Trossard has fallen
  down the pecking order in attack while Fábio Vieira has no future at the club.
  Creativity was a problem for Arsenal last season when their hopes of keeping
  up with Liverpool foundered on a chronic lack of ruthlessness, causing them to
  draw too many winnable games. Arsenal have been in regular contact with Eze’s
  representatives over the summer to discuss a move for the player, who left
  their academy at the age of 13. Palace, who have lost their appeal to be
  reinstated to the Europa League on Monday, will hope to hold on to their best
  attacker. Once Eze’s clause expires, they are expected to demand a similar fee
  that would include a significant chunk up front in order for them to find a
  replacement. Palace are believed to have targeted Leicester’s Bilal El
  Khannouss. Palace are trying to sell Marc Guéhi to avoid losing the defender
  for nothing next summer when his contract expires. He is a target for
  Liverpool.
