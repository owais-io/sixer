  Thousands of men gathered across Kabul on Friday to watch flowers being
  scattered from helicopters to mark the fourth anniversary of the Taliban’s
  return to power – a celebration that women were barred from attending. Three
  of the six “flower shower” locations were already off-limits to women, who
  have been prohibited from entering parks and recreational areas since November
  2022. The Taliban seized Afghanistan on 15 August 2021 as the US and Nato
  withdrew their forces at the end of a two-decade war. Since then, they have
  imposed their interpretation of Islamic law on daily life, including sweeping
  restrictions on women and girls, based on edicts from their leader, Hibatullah
  Akhundzada. Friday’s anniversary programme, which also included speeches from
  cabinet members, was only for men. An outdoor sports performance, initially
  expected to feature Afghan athletes, did not take place. Rights groups,
  foreign governments and the UN have condemned the Taliban for their treatment
  of women and girls, who remain barred from many jobs, education beyond sixth
  grade and most public spaces. Members of the United Afghan Women’s Movement
  for Freedom staged an indoor protest against Taliban rule on Friday in the
  north-eastern Takhar province. “This day marked the beginning of a black
  domination that excluded women from work, education, and social life,” the
  movement said in a statement shared with Associated Press. “We, the protesting
  women, remember this day not as a memory, but as an open wound of history, a
  wound that has not yet healed. The fall of Afghanistan was not the fall of our
  will. We stand, even in the darkness.” There was also an indoor protest in the
  Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Afghan women held up signs that said “Forgiving
  the Taliban is an act of enmity against humanity” and “August 15th is a dark
  day.” They were fully veiled, except for their eyes, in the photographs.
  Earlier in the day, the Taliban leader had said God would severely punish
  Afghans who were ungrateful for Islamic rule in the country, according to a
  statement. Akhundzada, who is seldom seen in public, said in a statement that
  Afghans had endured hardships and made sacrifices for almost 50 years so that
  Islamic law, or sharia, could be established. Sharia had saved people from
  “corruption, oppression, usurpation, drugs, theft, robbery, and plunder”, he
  said. “These are great divine blessings that our people should not forget and,
  during the commemoration of Victory Day, express great gratitude to Allah
  Almighty so that the blessings will increase,” Akhundzada said in comments
  shared on X. “If, against God’s will, we fail to express gratitude for
  blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe
  punishment of Allah Almighty,” he said. Last month, the international criminal
  court issued arrest warrants for Akhundzada and the chief justice, Abdul Hakim
  Haqqani, accusing them of crimes against humanity for the persecution of women
  and girls. The ICC said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” they had
  ordered policies that deprived women and girls of “education, privacy and
  family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and
  religion”. This year’s anniversary celebrations are more muted than last
  year’s, when the Taliban staged a military parade at a US airbase, drawing
  anger from Donald Trump about the abandoned American hardware on display.
  Afghanistan is also gripped by a humanitarian crisis made worse by the climate
  crisis, millions of Afghans expelled from Iran and Pakistan, and a sharp drop
  in donor funding.
