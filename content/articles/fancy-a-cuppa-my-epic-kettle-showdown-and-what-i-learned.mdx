  “Steamy windows!” belted out Tina Turner. I always thought she was singing
  about an erotic encounter, but now I believe she must have been testing
  kettles. There’s nothing quite like 12 of them boiling one after the other to
  fill your kitchen with mist, adding a soft-focus haze to everything in it and
  making every cold surface slick. Hair-frizzing humidity aside – I spent two
  days looking as if I had stuck my fingers in a plug socket – the bigger issue
  at the start was deciding how to test kettles. They all do the same thing in
  the same way. And they’ve changed little over the decades – a few from the
  1970s wouldn’t be out of place in your home today. Beyond a few
  nice-to-have-but-not-essential features, the kettle remains fundamental and
  fuss-free. Infini-tea and beyond Until now, my contributions to the Filter
  have been based on tangible results. I tested air fryers, the colour and crisp
  of homemade chips allowing me to discern which were good and which less so.
  Before that, my kitchen hosted a blizzard of blenders (surely the correct
  collective noun) – and again, the smoothest smoothies and soups pointed to the
  appliances with the keenest blades and most powerful motors. For kettles, it
  was clear that I needed gadgets to work out which were the better boilers of
  the bunch. And so, armed with a power meter, infrared thermometer, my phone
  running Decibel X, my husband’s phone as a timer and a probe thermometer, I
  began heating water. Lots of it. Litre upon litre of it. Enough to make hot
  drinks for everyone in my street and a few of their friends. And so, little by
  little, my kitchen became tropical-jungle clammy. However, it’s not just
  testing that decides which kettle is spout and lid above the others: I also
  factored in the more tangible aspects, such as build quality – do parts feel
  flimsy; minimum fills – whether you’ll always need to boil half a litre when
  200ml would do; and value for money – the price v what you actually get for
  it. Simply the best Only after all that did I decide which one I thought gave
  brew for buck: the Bosch Sky kettle (£100). Fast boiling, well designed and
  insulated to keep water hotter for longer, it’s a good all-rounder that would
  suit most households. For those hoping to spend less, Kenwood’s Ripple kettle
  (£32) was my best budget pick, offering style and substance with a low minimum
  fill, fast boil and choice of colours. Of course, when faced with the news
  that gen Z are bypassing the kettle in favour of the less-efficient microwave,
  you may wonder why I bothered testing at all. It only seems right to turn
  again to Tina, the covert product tester. If you’re replacing your kettle,
  it’s important to know which one is simply the Best. *** This week’s picks The
