  Donald Trump’s hugely disruptive trade war is setting the stage for a
  manufacturing renaissance in the US, administration officials say. Outside the
  White House, many economists are skeptical. Global trade experts point to many
  reasons they believe the president’s tariffs will fail to bring about a major
  resurgence of manufacturing, among them: Trump’s erratic, constantly changing
  policies, his unfocused, across-the-board tariffs, and his replacing Joe
  Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach to brandish sticks at the world. “I think
  [Trump’s tariffs] will reduce the competitiveness of US manufacturing, and
  will reduce manufacturing employment,” said Michael Strain, an economist at
  the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI). “They’re raising the
  costs of production to US manufacturing companies, and that makes
  manufacturers less competitive. There will be some winners and some losers,
  but the losers will outnumber the winners.” ‘Trump keeps changing his mind’
  The president and his aides insist that higher tariffs on more than 100
  countries – making goods imported from overseas more expensive – will spur
  domestic manufacturing. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global
  dominance under President Trump,” the White House spokesperson Kush Desai
  claimed recently. But few economists see that happening. Ann E Harrison, an
  economics professor and former dean of the Haas School of Business at the
  University of California, Berkeley, said the erratic, on-again-off-again
  rollout of Trump’s tariffs has already gone far to doom the president’s hopes
  of inspiring a huge wave of manufacturing investment. “For the policy to be
  successful, it has to be consistent over a long period,” she told the
  Guardian. “People need to believe it’s going to last. Some factories take five
  years to plan and build. You’re talking a long-term play. But Trump keeps
  changing his mind. Even over the last six months, we’ve had very little
  consistency. “The other problem is that he’s old, and no one is sure he’s
  going to be around that long. These policies need to be consistent, and that’s
  not happening.” Economists point to another question mark that is causing
  corporate executives to think twice about building factories in the US. In
  May, the US court of international trade ruled that Trump’s blanket tariffs
  are illegal – a decision that is under appeal. Strain, at the AEI, said: “When
  you add into the equation the erratic nature of President Trump’s tariff
  regime, when you add the question of its questionable illegality, when you add
  that none of this is going through Congress, when you add that even when the
  US secures a ‘deal’ with another country, it’s not really a deal, there are
  major outstanding questions.” France doesn’t think its alcohol exports will be
  hit by tariffs as part of the European Union’s agreement to pay 15% tariffs,
  noted Strain. “That’s a big question mark that would never go unresolved in
  any regular, traditional trade deal,” he said. “That’s all part of the massive
  uncertainty we’re seeing.” The Biden administration used deliberate industrial
  policies to boost several strategic industries, most notably semiconductors
  and electric vehicles, including a 100% tariff on EVs from China and 25% on
  lithium-ion EV batteries, as well as subsidies to buy EVs and build EV-related
  factories. The policies resulted in a surge in new factories to build
  semiconductors, electric vehicles and EV components. Biden “said we care about
  semiconductors and national security, and what he’d try to do is get actual
  investors to invest in it”, said Dani Rodrik, an economist specializing in
  trade and industrial policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, who
  predicted Trump’s blanket tariffs will prove less successful in inspiring
  investment. “If you really want to increase manufacturing and employment in
  the US, you’d go about it in a very different way, through industrial policies
  that first identify specific segments you care about.” When China, Japan and
  South Korea adopted policies to build their electronics and auto industries,
  they insisted that the corporations that benefited from those policies compete
  with foreign companies to help make them globally competitive. “For industrial
  policy to succeed, it has to work to promote more competition,” said Harrison,
  at the Haas School of Business. “The problem with tariffs is they do just the
  opposite. They restrict competition.” Susan Helper, an economist at Case
  Western Reserve University who worked on industrial policy in the Biden and
  Obama administrations, said Trump’s tariff rates on some countries and markets
  – like 15% on the EU, Japan and South Korea – are too low to spur much
  investment, questioning why a company would build a major factory to
  circumvent such a duty. “A [semiconductor fabrication] plant, that’s a billion
  dollars. You need to get a payback and that takes several years,” Helper said.
  “If the tariffs are 145% [as Trump once imposed on China], that’s attractive
  for building a plant. But if they fall back to 15%, then it’s really hard to
  get a return on your investment.” The administration boasts that several of
  its trade deals have specific commitments to spur huge manufacturing
  investment. It says its deal with the EU includes a $600bn investment pledge;
  with Japan, a $550bn investment pledge; and with South Korea, $350bn. Jamieson
  Greer, US trade representative, wrote in the New York Times: “These
  investments – 10 times larger than the inflation-adjusted value of the
  Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II – will accelerate US
  reindustrialization.” But these supposed pledges have attracted skepticism.
  After all, this president claimed during his first term that “the eighth
  wonder of the world” was being built in Wisconsin after FoxConn pledged to
  invest $10bn and create 13,000 jobs at an electronics plant. But that promise
  fell embarrassingly short. Many economists question whether the EU, Japan or
  South Korea can force corporations to make a specific investment in the US.
  Indeed, a European Commission spokesperson said the bloc had expressed
  “aggregate intentions” that are “in no way” binding. “These large numbers
  really sound like window dressing, some round numbers they’re throwing
  around,” said Harvard’s Rodrik. “Some include investments you were already
  going to make, and some are aspirational,” said Todd Tucker, a trade and
  industrial policy expert at the Roosevelt Institute. “Once we’ve had time to
  evaluate whether the investment happens or not, Trump will be on to the next
  press cycle.” In recent years, manufacturing employment has been trending
  downward – not just in advanced industrial countries, but also in China, as
  new technologies enable factories to churn out goods more efficiently, with
  fewer workers. That trend raises questions whether Trump’s trade policies can
  increase factory jobs in the US. ‘An island of backwardness’ The US is past
  its manufacturing peak, Berkeley’s Harrison noted. “That was actually during
  World War Two, and it has been declining ever since,” she said. “I don’t see
  manufacturing’s share of the economy or manufacturing employment reversing.”
  She added: “If the question is, are you going to bring about a major
  resurgence in manufacturing employment, it’s not just unlikely, the answer is
  no. More and more manufacturing is robot-driven and not done by people.” Auto
  industry officials in the US complain that Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and
  aluminum have increased their costs and injured their competitiveness. “In
  manufacturing, for every one job in steel production, there are 80 jobs that
  use steel,” the AEI’s Strain said. “So putting tariffs on imported steel might
  help that one guy, but you’re hurting the other 80 people.” A study by Federal
  Reserve economists found that the tariffs Trump imposed in his first term were
  actually associated with a reduction in factory jobs nationwide, because
  increased input costs and retaliatory tariffs outweighed import protection
  from tariffs. Helper, at Case Western Reserve University, warned that the US
  auto industry would be hurt badly by Trump’s mishmash of tariffs coupled with
  his slashing subsidies for EVs. “Trump’s policies are setting the auto
  industry up to be an island of backwardness,” she said. “The rest of the world
  is going to be making EVs, but we’re going to be focused on making really high
  profits on pickup trucks that will be bad for the climate and won’t sell in
  the rest of the world. “We’ll have a great, competitive position in large,
  gas-guzzling pickups, but we’ll fall further behind in EVs. That’s a very
  risky and dangerous path.”
