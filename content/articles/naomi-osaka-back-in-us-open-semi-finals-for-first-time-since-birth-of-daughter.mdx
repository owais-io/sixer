  Naomi Osaka is back to her resilient ways. On Wednesday night she turned back
  11th-seeded Karolina Muchova for a 6-4, 7-6 quarter-final victory at Arthur
  Ashe Stadium in just under two hours’ time. The former world No 1, who is just
  two years removed from watching the tournament from the stands, now finds
  herself back in a major semi-final for the first time since giving birth to
  her daughter, Shai, and well on her way toward reprising her mantle as a
  women’s tour standard-bearer. The two-time US Open champion enters Thursday’s
  matchup against Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova as the sentimental
  favorite. All four times that the Japanese has reached a grand slam
  quarter-final in her still-young career, she has gone on to win it all.
  Throughout this year’s US Open, she has not only sustained flashes of the
  belligerent game that gave rise to her hardcourt dominance. She’s shown she
  can move with the best of them and bide her time in long rallies and lash a
  winner when the moment’s right. “Honestly, I was just trying to hang in there
  and see if I got an opportunity,” Osaka said afterwards of her strategy
  against Muchova. Add a more positive attitude to those technical improvements
  and self-belief, and what you have is a player who appears more than up to the
  challenge of taking down Anisimova, herself in the throes of a career
  resurgence. Against Muchova, Osaka remained sturdy and steady in the face of
  the Czech’s offensive blitz. The opening games saw both women serve
  brilliantly but struggle to separate themselves. In the 10th game Osaka played
  the pressure points better and broke Muchova to stake a first-set lead. As
  Osaka made her way to her chair for the changeover, Muchova propped herself up
  with her racket to stretch out her legs behind the baseline before calling a
  medical timeout. “I just stepped like a little wrong with ugly move,” said
  Muchova – no stranger to surprise injuries, alas. “I don’t know what it is. I
  think it’s just something with the muscle that’s hopefully not going to take
  me long to heal. But, yeah, it limited me a little bit on the court.” To stay
  warm in the interim, Osaka practiced her serve and flagged down new coach
  Tomasz Wiktorowski for a few pointers from her player’s box. Muchova
  re-emerged on court after the break with wrap around her left leg that seemed
  as if it might hobble her. But she quickly put those concerns to rest by
  breaking Osaka to open the second set and by reaching deeper into her bag of
  tricks. Muchova’s quick hands at net helped her eke out a 4-3 lead and trip up
  Osaka – who could only scream and lightly spike her racket in response to the
  errors Muchova was inducing on her forehand. “There were a lot of moments
  where she broke me or she was really close to getting a really crucial moment
  or point,” Osaka said. “I just tried to play every point like it was the last
  point of the match.” Once the frustration left Osaka, though, there was only
  anger and her swinging away with focused rage until she broke back and brushed
  away an opportunity for Muchova to serve for the set at 5-4. After splitting
  three more holds with Muchova, Osaka raised her level again in the tiebreaker,
  sprinting out to a 5-2 lead and running Muchova ragged on her bandaged leg
  until an unforced forehand error ended her tournament. After the match, Osaka
  looked up into the stands at the adulating crowd and basked in her moment of
  catharsis a little while her mother, Tamaki, doubled over in her players box
  from emotion. “I’m surprised I’m not crying,” she said on court afterward.
  “Honestly, I was sitting up there watching and hoping I could have the
  opportunity to play on this court again. This is like my dream is coming
  true.”
