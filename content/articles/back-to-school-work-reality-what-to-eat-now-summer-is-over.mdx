  September arrives and, with it, the sudden, brutal gear shift from slow, lazy
  August, the mad rush to catch up on all the work you’ve been neglecting, to
  reconnect with the friends who’ve been away during summer. It’s back to the
  commute, back to work, back to school … We are also back at school – every
  Thursday for the past few years we’ve been taking pottery classes at college.
  From 10 in the morning until five in the evening we are covered in clay; our
  muddy fingers cannot check the phone every five minutes, and everyone at work
  knows not to contact us unless it’s an emergency – and even then, only if
  there’s something we can actually do about it. This also means that, for the
  first time since high school, we don’t have an obvious lunch solution. Our
  working life may lack many things, but as chefs our access to fresh, delicious
  food isn’t one of them. At college, though, we need to think ahead if we don’t
  want to rely on the canteen offerings (triangle-of-sadness sandwiches from the
  fridge or a lukewarm baked potato) – and we’re enjoying the weekly challenge.
  Wednesday-night dinner needs to be strategically planned so it will taste good
  at room temperature the next day. Pasta is a good shout, but not in a creamy
  or oily sauce, and nothing too fishy. All baked pasta dishes are better the
  next day, especially lasagne. That’s where Rachel Roddy’s pasta al forno with
  meatballs and mozzarella comes in – a bouncy, comforting baked dish that holds
  up beautifully (and tastes even better as leftovers). If you’re feeling
  particularly adventurous, Tamal Ray’s Sichuan-style lasagne – layered with
  fragrant spices, fermented broad bean sauce, mozzarella and bechamel – strikes
  just the right balance between bold and bowl-pleasing. Eggs are also great –
  particularly a frittata-style slab that’s firm enough to travel without
  toppling. And we always feel gloriously smug when we have a cold noodle salad
  with a little pot of dressing on the side. Of course, we’re not always
  organised, but we have developed a niche in morning salads: a slice of
  whatever’s lurking in the fridge, a chunk of feta, maybe a handful of mint,
  all tossed with that aforementioned dressing, which, if you ask us, tastes
  very much like victory at 1pm, when everyone else is queueing for a sad
  sandwich. And since a few of you might be in the same boat – new routines,
  toting packed lunches, feeling slightly frazzled but hopeful – here are some
  things to keep in your back pocket: Yotam Ottolenghi’s soba noodle salad (it
  practically begs to be eaten cold), Sami Tamimi’s frittata with herbs and veg,
  and our cheese and za’atar swirls (basically an edible hug that fits in a
  lunchbox). And if you do opt for an old-fashioned sandwich, Anna Jones has
  some inventive ideas for fillers (pictured top). We can’t promise these will
  make you better at throwing pots – ours are still wonky, though we’re calling
  it “rustic chic” – but they will definitely make our Thursdays more delicious.
  Wishing you all a soft landing back to the grind, smooth commutes and very
  smug lunches. Our week in food Transported by flavours | We will travel far
  for Korean food. One day we will go as far as Korea but until then, journeying
  from south to east London was worth it for the charming delights of Miga. And
  for afters | We lingered on our Miga meal so much that we had to return our
  table before we had dessert. Luckily, it was a balmy night and a gentle stroll
  led us to the ever-glorious Café Cecilia. Even though it was packed, the staff
  let us sit on the bench outside and have all the desserts (there were four of
  us …), Their kindness and hospitality is as sweet as their bread and butter
  pudding. Sounds delicious | A new season of our podcast, The Food Sessions, is
  out, an exploration of joy and the things that some of our favourite people do
  to increase it in their lives. Alas, we didn’t get guest Emily Maitlis’s
  recipe for chicken in lavender, but we gathered plenty of other insights on
  how to up the happiness. If you want to read the complete version of this
