  Australia’s online safety chief has warned the Albanese government of the
  imminent “ground war” by tech giants harnessing “the most famous influencers”
  before a social media ban for under-16s later this year. Anthony Albanese
  announced in July the government’s decision to include YouTube in the
  restrictions set to begin from December, reversing an earlier decision to
  exempt the video platform. The decision followed advice from the eSafety
  commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, that its exclusion was inconsistent with the
  law’s intention given it had similar functionality to other social media
  sites, such as TikTok and Instagram. In emails to the communication minister’s
  office, Inman Grant said she anticipated the laws would invoke a “lobbying
  surge” brought on by concerns the ban would affect advertising revenue, a
  trove of newly released documents tabled in the Senate on Wednesday show. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email “Finally, we are anticipating a potential lobbying
  surge by the currently excluded platform and I expect the ground war will be
  at the education level – and will also involve the harnessing of the most
  famous influencers,” Inman Grant wrote to a senior adviser in Anika Wells’
  office in June after a meeting. “We all know that this is about monetisation
  of the millions of under 16’s on these platforms who HAVE accounts today – but
  may then not at commencement. This will have an impact on attracting certain
  advertisers that may be targeting the 8-15 demographic.” After a meeting with
  YouTube officials in July, Inman Grant reiterated her advice to the minister
  to exclude the video platform, noting its key arguments were “moot”. “If
  YouTube is adamant that they are not an age-restricted social media service
  then any concerns held by Google about the impact of them not being
  specifically exempted in the rules seem to me to be moot,” she said in an
  email five days before the government’s announcement. “If the service isn’t
  caught by Part 4A (as Google asserts) then it logically can’t be exempted.”
  Part 4A of the act defines what an age-restricted social media platform is.
  The documents, which detail the discussions around determining which social
  media sites the restrictions would be applied to, also show the department’s
  concern about information from meeting with TikTok officials leaking to the
  media. In a June briefing note ahead of a meeting between Wells’ chief of
  staff and TikTok officials, the department flagged they would “likely raise
  the exclusion of YouTube” from the rules. It also warned some information from
  meetings with the previous communications minister, Michelle Rowland, had been
  shared with the media. “In the past, TikTok has sought to exploit perceived
  misalignments in position between the department and Minister Rowland’s
  office. Statements made in meetings with TikTok have appeared in the media
  shortly after the meetings,” the briefing note said. TikTok declined to
  comment. Three days after the meeting with TikTok officials, Wells sought
  advice from Inman Grant about minor changes to the draft rules, which included
  YouTube remaining exempt. Inman Grant’s advice was delivered the following
  week offering five options, with the first being to remove YouTube’s
  exclusion. The department agreed with this advice. Wells met with the Wiggles
  chief executive, Kate Chiodo, on 30 June to discuss their support for
  YouTube’s exclusion from the ban. The department’s briefing note confirms
  thinking in the federal government that YouTube Kids – a video-streaming
  version of the platform that is accessed by parents or guardians and doesn’t
  allow comments – will likely be excluded from the ban. It said the Wiggles and
  other early learning content creators were “highly unlikely to be impacted” by
  the restrictions because they could still be viewed through YouTube Kids.
  However, the department did concede the earnings of content creators could be
  affected. “While access for Australian children is unlikely to be affected,
  revenue to creators like the Wiggles could be affected. In particular, while
  YouTube offers a number of ways for creators to monetise their content, many
  of these focus on creators’ subscriber numbers,” the briefing note said. Inman
  Grant’s advice to Wells included another option to consider re-drafting the
  rules to ensure platforms can be exempted for both their purpose, as well as
  the harm they risk. The department agreed with the advice but recommended to
  Wells they be considered as part of a two-year review of the laws after coming
  into effect, noting the complexity of the change. After a meeting between
  Inman Grant and an adviser from Wells’ office, the eSafety commissioner said
  the change was “critical” given some platforms could “dial back their policies
  or eviscerate their trust and safety teams”. “From my perspective, this is
  critical from an enforceability perspective and, as I said yesterday, the risk
  profiles and threat vectors change regulatory on platforms – particularly when
  they dial back their policies or eviscerate their trust and safety teams,”
  Inman Grant wrote in June. “Another trend we have called the platforms on is
  allowing the veritable ‘colonisation’ of organised criminals on their
  platforms to target under-aged users with sexual extortion and other social
  engineering scams because they are failing (quite deliberately) to prevent
  ‘recidivism’ on their platforms by not tackling the mass proliferation of fake
  and imposter accounts.” Wells arranged a meeting with YouTube’s global CEO,
  Neal Mohan, on 3 July to discuss “YouTube’s desire to be excluded from the
  social media minimum age obligation”, according to the documents. It said
  Wells was “seeking information on why YouTube believes it is different from
  other social media platforms and warrants an exclusion”. The documents also
  reveal the Snapchat CEO, Evan Spiegel, met with Wells on 30 July to discuss
  the ban, in a meeting that was facilitated by Australia’s ambassador to the
  US, Kevin Rudd. Guardian Australia has gone to Snapchat and YouTube for a
  response.
