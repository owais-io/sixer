  The Trump family media company has partnered with GB News to broadcast the
  British news channel on its US streaming platform, Truth+. Trump Media and
  Technology Group (TMTG), which operates the social media app Truth Social, the
  streaming platform Truth+, and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, announced on Friday
  it will add GB News to its list of available channels, making it accessible to
  most countries globally, including the US. GB News, which has hosted rightwing
  commentators such as Nigel Farage, will be offered with the free basic package
  on Truth+, and can be accessed through several devices and platforms including
  iOS, Android, Web, Apple TV, Android TV, and Amazon Fire. The US president
  continues to criticise the mainstream media, filing lawsuits against giants
  such as Rupert Murdoch, as well as broadcasters and smaller newspapers.
  Earlier this year, Trump said the US media was full of “radical-left
  monsters”, who were guilty of “illegal” reporting. More recently the White
  House communications director, Steven Cheung, said “liberal media” is
  spreading “fake news” in relation to reports, claiming that Trump’s name
  appeared in US justice department files about Jeffrey Epstein. Trump Media’s
  chief executive and chairperson, Devin Nunes, said in a statement: “GB News is
  a terrific source for news, facts and commentary. “By expanding its global
  reach, we aim to connect an enormous new, international audience to the
  network’s unique reporting and opinion, while putting another dent in the
  global woke news monopoly.” Angelos Frangopoulos, GB News’s chief executive,
  said: “As the fearless champion of freedom of speech in Britain, it is
  important that we launch across the United States of America and globally on
  the Truth+ streaming platform.”
