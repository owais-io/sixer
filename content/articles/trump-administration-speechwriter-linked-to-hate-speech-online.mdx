  A speechwriter for the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security
  (DHS) has come under scrutiny after he was linked to hate speech online. Eric
  Lendrum compared the circumstances of American conservatives to that of
  enslaved people and Jewish people in Nazi Germany, and in his podcast claimed
  that the racist great replacement conspiracy theory was “real”, the news
  outlet Notus reported. Notus reported that Lendrum began working at the DHS,
  which is headed by Kristi Noem, in March this year, after previously working
  at the Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. The
  DHS has been at the forefront of Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented
  immigration during his second presidency. In the gap between his government
  roles, Lendrum was a frequent online presence, hosting a podcast, posting on X
  and Telegram, and writing a blog on the website American Greatness. In one
  post from December 2021, Lendrum defended people who participated in the
  January 6 insurrection, claiming they faced “persecution for their
  patriotism”. “It has been said that the most surefire way to create an
  authoritarian regime is to completely dehumanize a significant portion of the
  population, so that their subsequent enslavement by the state will not face
  any larger resistance,” Lendrum wrote. “It was true during slavery, it was
  true during the Holocaust, and it is true now. “Actress Gina Carano [who
  likened the experience of Jews during the Holocaust to the US political
  climate] was right; American conservatives are, right now, on a course for
  being every bit as ostracized and alienated from broader society as Jews were
  in the years leading up to Nazi Germany.” Lendrum also expressed extremist
  views on his podcast, claiming in October 2022 that the great replacement
  theory, a racist conspiracy narrative that falsely asserts there is an active,
  ongoing and covert effort to replace white populations in current
  white-majority countries, was “already being put into effect in some European
  cities”. Notus and the Daily Beast found hateful posts on an X account which
  belongs to Lendrum. In one post from 2023 he shared a video of thousands of
  people protesting against Israel’s war on Gaza, and wrote: “Cars are bigger
  and heavier than any one of these freaks. All it takes is one brave driver to
  do what needs to be done, then others will follow.” The Daily Beast reported
  that the same account repeatedly posted anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments, calling
  transgender people “child molesters” and referring to “LGBTQ freaks”. The DHS
  did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When reached by Notus,
  the department responded by sending a link to the first amendment, which
  protects free speech.
