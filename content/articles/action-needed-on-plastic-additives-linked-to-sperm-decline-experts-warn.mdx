  Action must be taken to curb the use of plastic additives linked to plummeting
  sperm counts, a leading reproductive scientist has warned, as splits over
  chemical regulation contributed to the collapse of a crucial treaty on plastic
  pollution. Across the world, sperm counts have been declining at a rate of
  about 1% a year for the past 50 years, and human fertility has been
  diminishing at a similar rate, studies have shown. Increasing levels of
  obesity, sedentary lifestyles and ageing populations have all been held up as
  possible causes. But according to Dr Shanna Swan, professor of environmental
  medicine and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in
  New York City, environmental factors play the most significant role. Swan said
  the decline was “largely, but not entirely due to toxins in the environment
  that have the ability to interfere with steroid hormones”. In 2017, Swan and
  her colleagues published a meta-analysis showing a decline in sperm counts of
  almost 60% among men in North America, Europe and Australia between 1973 and
  2011. In 2023, they repeated the research, extending the study to 2018 and
  including previously unavailable data from Africa, Asia and South America, and
  made even more shocking findings. “We separated the countries into western and
  non-western for analytic purposes, and in both we found a significant
  decline,” Swan said. “And the other thing that we found, which was at least as
  alarming, was that if you looked at all of the studies going back to 1973 you
  see a 1% per year decline. But if you look at studies published after 2000,
  you see an over 2% decline. “So the rate of decline had increased, and had
  increased significantly in recent years.” Swan’s warning comes amid rising
  alarm at the impact of chemical toxicity on human and environmental health.
  Two weeks ago, a report published by Deep Science Ventures, a business focused
  on environmental solutions, which was reviewed by Swan, warned that chemical
  pollution was “a threat … of a similar order as climate change”, but received
  far less attention. The decline in sperm rates since about 1950 stands in an
  inverse relationship to the explosion in the use of plastics. Swan points out
  that there are now well-established links between common additives to plastics
  and falling sperm counts. “Phthalates are chemicals that are put into plastic
  to give it flexibility and make it soft and flexible,” Swan said. “So anytime
  you pick up a soft water bottle or tubing, like medical tubing, or a food
  container that’s soft, you’re going to be touching phthalates. “Then, on the
  other side, the evil twin of phthalates are the bisphenols. While phthalates
  make plastic soft and flexible, bisphenols make it hard and inflexible. And
  phthalates lower testosterone and the bisphenols increase oestrogen.” The
  effects of these and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals were particularly
  profound on foetuses and embryos developing in the womb, Swan said. She had
  previously carried out research into the effects of phthalates on unborn male
  babies, finding that exposure at a critical point in gestation could lead to
  subtle deformities in sexual development. The adverse effects of phthalates in
  the womb, known as “phthalate syndrome”, included smaller penises, a shorter
  distance between the genitals and anus, and – once children reached sexual
  maturity – lowered sperm counts, Swan said. “We showed the link between the
  exposure and fertility,” she said. “And when you see that total sperm count
  going down worldwide, what I believe is you’re seeing an important effect of
  early exposure to these chemicals.” Swan would not be drawn into commenting on
  the talks, which were under way as she spoke, in Geneva for a comprehensive
  treaty to end the plastic pollution crisis. But she said action needed to be
  taken on the use of plastic additives, with an urgent need for safer
  replacements. “In the meantime, yes people can be careful,” she said. “They
  can reuse materials. They should try to look at what they use in their takeout
  containers and carry little glass bottles around to get their drinks. It’s
  very important. But it’s not solving a bigger problem, which is how do we make
  these things that we have become dependent on in a safer way?” Signs of a
  solution are not promising. Last week, after nearly two weeks of talks,
  negotiators left Geneva on Friday having failed to reach an agreement, after
  oil- and gas-producing nations objected to calls for limits to production and
  curbs on chemicals. Almost 100 nations had signed a declaration calling for a
  “legally binding obligation to phase out those most harmful plastic products
  and chemicals of concern”. But both texts drafted by Luis Vayas Valdivieso,
  the chair of the negotiating committee, omitted any reference to controls on
  chemicals.
