  It’s after work on a Wednesday night, and I’m at a sports bar in downtown
  Manhattan. It looks exactly like what you’d expect of a bar in the Financial
  District. Men in button-up shirts stand around a tall table with folded arms,
  ranting about the current season as multiple baseball games are playing on TV
  screens all around the bar. I feel out of place as I wait for a friend, but I
  know it’s only a matter of time until things change. A stream of women slowly
  trickles in, group by group. The mood abruptly changes when the TV screens
  flicker on to a clip of sparkling water. The bar cranks up the volume, a
  wistful three notes plays over the speaker, the brief theme song of what has
  become a show so popular that sports bars in Manhattan are throwing watch
  parties for women who, like me, are years older than the show’s protagonist. I
  have a confession: when I first watched The Summer I Turned Pretty upon the
  series’s release on Amazon in 2022, I only got through two episodes. I quickly
  deemed the show too cringe-inducing to handle. I believed I had grown out of
  love triangles driven by hormones and a lack of a fully developed prefrontal
  cortex. Growing up had taught me there were much, much more important choices
  to make in life than who you take to debutante ball. Also, the lead
  character’s name is Belly, and no one’s questioning that? But when I gave the
  show another chance this summer, after the encouragement of a friend, I
  realized just how wrong I was. Once I dropped my defenses and settled into
  life in Cousins, the fictional beach town where the show is set, I was hooked.
  And when my social media feeds adjusted to my new obsession, I realized just
  how many people were as well. Video after video showed the heavy investment
  adults have in this teen drama, from screaming at TVs to full-on tears from
  the show. Prime reported 25 million worldwide viewers tuned into the third
  season’s premiere the week of its release, a 40% increase from the second
  season’s release in 2023. It’s been a strange summer for American pop culture.
  After Charli xcx’s Brat painted last summer green, there’s been a curious
  absence of the standard “song of the summer”. The closest contender, some
  argue, is the “nothing beats a Jet2 holiday” ad that’s been featured in clip
  after clip online. The movie theaters were filled with reboots and sequels for
  Superman and Jurassic Park. And the most popular TV show in the US appeared to
  be Love Island, which had near-daily episodes of eye-rolling drama for six
  weeks until mid-July. Instead of a clubby pop song, this summer’s rhythms have
  been dictated by constant updates to the rapidly changing world we’re living
  in. Americans seem to be feeling more uncertain about their futures than ever.
  News notifications can feel like a never-ending barrage for anyone trying to
  keep up. In other words, the timing was ripe for a show that provides an
  escape. As temperatures started to peak, the third and final season of The
  Summer I Turned Pretty premiered in mid-July and has cemented itself, for
  many, as the show that saved summer. The series centers Isabel “Belly” Conklin
  (Lola Tung), whose family spends every summer at the Fishers’ giant beach
  house at Cousins, a town resembling the neighborhoods of Cape Cod,
  Massachusetts. The series starts the summer that Belly turns, you guessed it,
  pretty and begins to attract the attention of boys, including the two Fisher
  brothers, Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). In the
  backdrop of this coming-of-age summer is the cancer diagnosis of Susannah
  (Rachel Blanchard), the Fisher matriarch who is the college best friend of
  Belly’s mom. Susannah’s diagnosis is a secret to most, allowing many of the
  characters to have their carefree teenage summer. Belly’s biggest concern
  appears to be whether Conrad, the brooding older brother and her longtime
  crush, has any feelings for her – or whether she should be with Jeremiah, her
  “best friend” who is drawn to her. In its third season, the series has
  wholeheartedly embraced this Austenian love triangle, framing it against
  complex emotions around grief. Susannah’s death less than a year after that
  first summer has only heightened Belly’s emotional hold over both brothers.
  Their late mother, on her deathbed, called Belly “my special girl” and often
  referred to her as the daughter she never had. But by the start of the season,
  Belly, who was 15 in the show’s first season, is now about to turn 21 and has
  made her choice. After an intense but failed relationship with Conrad, Belly
  has chosen Jeremiah. The two have been together in college for three years
  while Conrad was on the west coast. But while the three characters pretend
  things are good and settled, they are clearly far from it. As a grown adult,
  I’m fully aware of how absurd this plot is. A love triangle with two brothers
  is only a huge red flag right next to an arrow pointed toward a therapist’s
  office. But at some point, I accepted The Summer I Turned Pretty as a fantasy
  world that is a pastel-tinged version of our own and learned to bask in its
  endless, wonderful melodrama. The Summer I Turned Pretty is the second success
  for author Jenny Han, co-runner of the series and author of the trilogy that
  inspired the show. Her other book trilogy, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before
  was adapted for Netflix and became one of its most-watched original movies
  when it was released in 2018. The series feels like a surprise hit for Amazon,
  which has found more success with shows targeted to male audiences such as The
  Boys, Jack Ryan and Reacher. Netflix has been the traditional home for
  originals geared toward young women and teens like Never Have I Ever,
  Heartstopper and XO, Kitty, the spin-off show from To All the Boys I’ve Loved
  Before. Han seems to have mastered teen romance, making it all feel
  refreshingly tender and sweet, taking seriously what is often dismissed as
  frivolous. Her stories ask readers and viewers to step into worlds where the
  choices these teenage girls make feel undeniably consequential. It’s a kind of
  unapologetic sincerity that evokes the teen dramas of the early 2000s. In The
  Summer I Turned Pretty, declarations of love are delivered with full gusto,
  the sound of waves crashing in the background. And the show never fails to
  lean on its seemingly unlimited soundtrack budget. So far, the series has
  played no less than 20 Taylor Swift songs that punctuate its emotional high
  points. Many have pointed out that the show shares a filming location –
  Wilmington, North Carolina – with One Tree Hill, which premiered over two
  decades ago. And unlike the first and second seasons, which were released in
  batches, the 12 episodes of this final season are released every Wednesday. To
  those of us who grew up with cable, it’s reminiscent of the feeling of rushing
  home to catch the newest episode of a TV show. The wait encourages
  anticipation, what feels rare in an era of endless, bingeable content online.
  It’s also proof that old-fashioned scripted TV shows, under a traditional
  weekly release schedule, can still have pull over younger audiences who are
  increasingly drawn to platforms including YouTube. As much as the show brings
  me back to the days of Gilmore Girls and The OC, its huge online presence
  makes it feel distinctly modern. The endless stream of content has culminated
  into a sort of communal viewing experience. With clips on TikTok, fans can
  relive the show’s moments over and over again with plenty of commentary and
  mockery. Of course, the show indulges in the drama surrounding its love
  triangle. As with any teen love triangle, people have divided themselves into
  “teams”. Who you root for suddenly becomes a barometer of your core values.
  The passion over the characters have become so intense that Prime Video and
  members of the show have had to remind viewers to conduct themselves
  respectfully online. Han, in an Instagram story, told fans that “the cast
  shouldn’t have to endure harassment because of the roles they play”. Amazon
  reminded fans that “the show isn’t real but the people playing the characters
  are”. Some elements in the third season seem so excessive and ridiculous as to
  be made for virality. (Some spoilers ahead.) In a scene in the season’s sixth
  episode, Conrad and Belly make a pit – stop at a roadside peach stand. As
  Belly eats a peach, a heavy stream of juice runs down her mouth. Conrad
  untucks his plain white T-shirt – clearly a part of his coastal-dad drip – to
  gingerly wipe the juice from her mouth. Videos on TikTok quickly turned the
  scene into an inside joke among fans. Even Nobel prize laureate and
  assassination-attempt survivor Malala Yousafzai posted a picture of herself on
  Instagram holding up a peach, with the caption “counting the minutes until
  Wednesday”. For me, the absurdity of it all is a reminder that the show is
  very much fiction, a world to step into like a book splayed open on a poolside
  lounge chair. I can’t help but root for Belly. We all know what it’s like to
  be young, naive and feel like the weight of the world rests on each choice we
  have to make for ourselves. Tuning in every week feels like a quick escape
  back to that time – far away from the usual cadences of life, as evocative as
  summer itself.
