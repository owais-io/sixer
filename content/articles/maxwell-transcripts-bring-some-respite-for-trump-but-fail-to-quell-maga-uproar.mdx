  For weeks, Donald Trump has been on the defensive over his handling of the
  Jeffrey Epstein investigative files and the extent of his own personal links
  to the late sex trafficker. While Trump had promised to release files related
  to Epstein, his justice department announced in July there would be no more
  disclosures, prompting uproar among conspiracy-minded Maga adherents and many
  other of his supporters. As criticism grew louder, the deputy attorney general
  Todd Blanche – who defended Trump in criminal proceedings – interviewed
  Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her
  involvement in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls. After the first interview
  session, Blanche said “the Department of Justice will share additional
  information about what we learned at the appropriate time”. The appropriate
  time turned out to be just before 3pm ET on Friday, 22 August when the
  department published redacted transcripts of Blanche’s interviews with
  Maxwell. While the transcripts span hundreds of pages, their contents are
  unlikely to satisfy those who want to know more about Trump’s past association
  with Epstein – let alone those who believe that the deceased financier was
  part of a powerful cabal of the global elite preying on young girls. Maxwell’s
  comments on Trump in the transcripts largely played into his efforts to
  distance himself from Epstein. If anything, the transcripts revealed Maxwell’s
  ongoing sense of aggrieved entitlement – as well as Blanche’s intense focus on
  Bill Clinton, who like Trump had past dealings with Epstein. “I think [Trump
  and Epstein] were friendly like people are in social settings. I don’t – I
  don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the
  president in any of – I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for
  instance,” said Maxwell, who had been Epstein’s on-again, off-again
  girlfriend. “I actually never saw the president in any type of massage
  setting,” Maxwell also said, alluding to Epstein’s abuse of women and teen
  girls whom he’d met under the guise of them providing massages. Maxwell was
  asked whether she had heard Epstein or anybody say that Trump had done
  anything inappropriate with masseuses, or anybody, in their world. “Absolutely
  never, in any context,” Maxwell said. Such comments would be music to Trump’s
  ears as he has long played down the extent of his social contacts with
  Epstein. Maxwell, who shortly after being interviewed by Blanche was moved
  from her Florida jail to a much lower security one in Texas, was also asked
  whether she remembered if Trump had contributed to a birthday book for
  Epstein. The Wall Street Journal had reported that Trump sent a “bawdy”
  birthday letter to Epstein in 2003 featuring a drawing of a nude woman. Trump
  has filed suit over this reporting. “I do not remember,” Maxwell said of the
  incident. Blanche repeatedly asked Maxwell about the Clintons, who, like
  Trump, have also denied knowing of any of Epstein’s crimes. When asked whether
  she knew if Bill Clinton had ever received a massage, Maxwell said “I don’t
  believe he did.” During the second interview day, Blanche asked Maxwell
  whether Epstein had a separate relationship with Clinton outside of the former
  president’s philanthropic work. He also asked whether Epstein had “any sort of
  visit, dealings or – associated with Hillary Clinton?” Maxwell said: “I would
  say no.” Did Maxwell know whether “Epstein ever did any business transactions
  with the Clintons?” she was also asked. But if Blanche was looking to
  incriminate the Clintons, Maxwell came up short. Just like she had with Trump.
  The true made-for-tabloid moments in Maxwell’s interviews in the transcripts
  dealt more with aspects of Epstein’s personal life and her posh asides. “He
  started doing testosterone and that altered his character. And I believe that
  started in the late 90s,” Maxwell said of Epstein. “He became more
  aggressive.” As time went on, Epstein started surrounding himself with more
  people, including more masseuses. Maxwell said she didn’t know he was having
  sexual relations with them. Blanche pushed back, saying: “I mean, you had to
  know at that point that there was something going on beyond just, he really
  needed to get massaged.” Maxwell said that was a “very fair question” but
  noted that the masseuse he’d seen most frequently was in her 40s. “The second
  thing is that – is, he told me he didn’t – he had difficulty having an
  erection, and I believed him.” She said Epstein had gotten into business
  “where he looked for stolen money”. Epstein had a girlfriend, the daughter of
  a billionaire, who had some money stolen. “And for some reason this woman
  introduced Jeffrey, and Jeffrey, I think that’s how that business started.
  That’s what I remember.” Epstein’s potential links to the world of espionage
  are a staple of conspiracy theories surrounding him. As for whether Epstein
  had ties to law enforcement agencies or intelligence operatives, Maxwell said:
  “I think he would’ve bragged about it to me as a show off, because he could be
  a show off. And if he wasn’t, he might have dropped it like he was cool. And I
  don’t think – I don’t remember him doing either.” Maxwell said there was a
  caveat. “Before I met him finding money, I think he may have suggested that
  there was some people who helped him, but that’s the only context that I
  recall that in.” Blanche asked what she meant. “He showed me a photograph that
  he had with some African warlords or something that he told me. And, you know,
  I get – I don’t remember if I – that’s what I interpreted the – like that kind
  of thing or whether it was something like that. “That’s the only actual active
  memory I have of something nefarious – not nefarious. I don’t even know if it
  was nefarious, but covert, I suppose would be the word.” During various points
  of the interview, Maxwell also found ways to point to her prim and proper
  upbringing. In discussing how she felt duped by Epstein, she said: “I’m not
  stupid. I’m very bright. I’ve had an excellent education. I traveled all over
  the world.” Maxwell also said that she did not think Epstein killed himself in
  prison but did not think someone from outside of prison had him killed. “In
  prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a
  prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That’s about the going
  rate,” Maxwell said. Maxwell moved to her new minimum security prison camp
  just a few days after her sit-down with Blanche ended.
