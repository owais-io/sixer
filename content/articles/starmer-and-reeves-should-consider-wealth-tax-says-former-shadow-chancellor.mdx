  The Treasury should consider a wealth tax to close the growing gap in the
  public finances, according to a Labour former shadow chancellor. Anneliese
  Dodds, who held the role under Keir Starmer in opposition, said ministers must
  have a “full and frank discussion” with the public about the “really big
  decisions” they had to take at this autumn’s budget. With Rachel Reeves aiming
  to fill a financial hole that economists say could exceed £20bn, the senior
  Labour MP said there was “no silver bullet” to funding big-ticket items such
  as defence but the chancellor should consider tax rises. Dodds quit her post
  as international development minister in February over a decision to slash the
  aid budget to pay for increased defence spending – a move she said was a
  mistake that would have a big impact on global security. With Russia and China
  already stepping into the gap to boost their own global influence, she said
  now was not the time for the UK to be “walking back” from using soft power. In
  her first interview since standing down, Dodds told the Guardian: “It’s
  important that we have a longer-term approach. That does mean asking and
  confronting difficult questions around our fiscal position, around taxation.
  But if we’re open and honest about the nature of the challenge that we face,
  we cannot duck that. “Now is a time when we’re seeing forces outside our
  country’s control impacting on our security. It’s important to have an open
  conversation with the public and say that means we will need to change when it
  comes to tax. That needs to be done in a way where those with the broadest
  shoulders take more responsibility.” While she did not set out exactly where
  wealth taxes might fall, Dodds urged the Treasury to “look carefully” at the
  work of economist Arun Advani, whose wealth tax commission in 2020 recommended
  a one-off levy on millionaire households as a better way of raising revenue
  than increasing taxes on workers or consumers. She joins a growing chorus of
  Labour MPs, not all from the left of the party, calling for further wealth
  taxes this autumn. However, proposals for an annual 2% tax on assets over £10m
  have been denounced as “daft” by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds.
  Government insiders have questioned whether it would raise any funds. Dodds
  acknowledged there would be consequences from any new wealth tax and said she
  did not underestimate the challenges involved. However, she played down
  suggestions the policy would automatically lead to a reduction in the tax base
  as people moved assets overseas. She added: “There’s no silver bullet here,
  and I’ve been quite cautious about claims in the past that there’s one single
  change to tax that could suddenly, immediately inject enormous amounts of
  money into the government coffers without any further implications. That’s
  simply not the case. There will be consequences.” Dodds also suggested that
  Reeves should look again at her fiscal rules to help deliver an increase in
  defence spending, rather than through further cuts to aid. The government has
  pledged to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence from 2027, with an ambition to reach
  3% in the next parliament. It has not said how this would be paid for. She
  said it would be very difficult for the UK to change its fiscal rules to
  borrow more to invest in defence, as Germany – which was in a stronger
  economic position – did when it loosened its “debt brake” in March. But she
  added: “There’s no route forward without some risk and without some cost.”
  Forecasts twice a year from the Office for Budget Responsibility have ended up
  driving fiscal policy, injecting more uncertainty into the system, she said.
  The IMF has suggested the government should consider having the public
  finances formally assessed only once a year instead. Dodds said she had little
  doubt the government would have to further increase defence spending. But she
  said this could not come from further cuts to the aid budget without an impact
  on global security and migration patterns. “I believe the public know that
  also,” she said. “We need to have a really full and frank discussion now
  nationally about how we will deliver that more secure country, but also about
  the challenges of doing that at the same time as getting our public services
  up off their knees. “We did see a reduction in our soft power, and we saw a
  reduction in what makes our country stronger. Especially now with the rise of
  China, Russia, becoming far more involved in the continent of Africa, and many
  other geopolitical pressures, now isn’t the time to be walking back from those
  commitments. “We will also see the impact on global security. We also see the
  impact of it in population movements. It’s no surprise that the number of
  people seeking asylum in the UK from Sudan, for example, has increased. There
  is eventually that knock-on impact. There’s no question about that.” Dodds
  said there was “no magic wand” to bring down the number of asylum hotels,
  which have been funded from the aid budget. Suggestions that the government
  could make big savings from quick closures were “just not credible”. She did
  not criticise Starmer directly for his “island of strangers” remarks, which
  the prime minister has since said he regretted, and said it was “right to
  acknowledge people’s concerns” about small boat crossings but she urged
  ministers “to be clear that we are talking ultimately about human beings”. As
  a former Labour chair, Dodds suggested the party had to do more to explain
  what it stood for to take on the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. She said:
  “What I find time and again when I speak with people who are considering
  Reform is that they want politicians to say what they think. They want
  politicians who are upfront about what they believe and who act on their
  beliefs.” She described Jeremy Corbyn’s new movement as “a bit like the
  People’s Front of Judea” from Monty Python’s Life of Brian but warned that it
  could end up splitting the vote: “We have seen in some other countries, a
  splintering of the left, and centre-left parties doing very badly.”
