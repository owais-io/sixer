  Good afternoon. Qantas has been fined a record $90m in the federal court for
  illegally firing 1,820 baggage handlers and other ground staff during Covid
  lockdowns in 2020, taking the cost of its controversial outsourcing decision
  to more than $200m. Justice Michael Lee handed down his decision on the
  penalty on Monday, nine months after Qantas and the Transport Workers’ Union
  agreed the airline would pay $120m in compensation to the sacked workers. He
  described the lengthy legal battle between the TWU and Qantas as “no ordinary
  case” and said he had “hesitation in reaching a conclusion” as to whether
  Qantas was “truly contrite or rather engaging in performative remorse”. The
  TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said the union had won a “David and
  Goliath” battle against the odds and secured “the most significant industrial
  outcome in Australia’s history”. Qantas has accepted the landmark fine, with
  the CEO, Vanessa Hudson, saying it “holds us accountable”. Top news Far-right
