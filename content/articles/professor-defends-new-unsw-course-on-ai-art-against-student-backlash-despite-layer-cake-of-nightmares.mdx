  ‘layer cake of nightmares’

  A major Australian university has rejected student calls for a new subject
  teaching generative AI to artists to be scrapped over environmental and
  intellectual property concerns, with the course’s head warning its critics
  risked being “anti-art”. “Generative AI for Artists” is being taught for the
  first time at the University of New South Wales next semester. The elective
  was initially introduced in 2021 under the name “Emerging Media Technologies
  Studio” and was reworked last year under its current format. UNSW’s handbook
  says the subject will teach students to develop a creative practice with AI
  through a “range of widely used tools” and explore critical and conceptual
  perspectives on the use of AI in creative arts, including copyright and moral
  rights. In late July, Robyn, a fine arts and education student at UNSW,
  started a petition calling for the subject to be cancelled and for the
  university to commit to not requiring the use of generative AI in any future
  courses. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The petition, which had amassed more
  than 7,000 signatures, led to UNSW’s Student Representative Council (SRC)
  passing a motion calling for the course to be removed and for a review of the
  environmental and ethical impacts of using generative AI at the university.
  Associate Prof Oliver Bown is teaching the subject and said he agreed with the
  issues raised over generative AI, which he said on Bluesky was bringing a
  “layer cake of nightmares” on the creative sector. But he cautioned against
  cancelling the course, warning if you set a “guilt by association precedent
  you wrongly condemn a wide range of important arts practices”. “If you make
  claims about what is and isn’t valid art you’re at risk of being the one who
  is ‘anti art’,” his post read. Australian universities have pivoted from
  cautioning over the use of artificial intelligence when ChatGPT was rolled out
  in 2023 to embedding emerging technologies into courses and assessments. The
  University of New England also offers a unit on “Creativity and Artificial
  Intelligence”, which includes the opportunity to “collaborate” with AI to
  produce a creative work, while at least a dozen institutions including Monash
  University, the University of Adelaide, the University of Queensland and the
  University of Western Australia offer bachelor or master’s degrees
  specifically in artificial intelligence. Robyn said they found out about the
  subject in a group chat with fellow fine arts students, who were “upset” and
  “disturbed”. “I’ve never used AI as part of my practice,” they said. “There
  was a period in which I considered stopping posting my art on the internet
  because there was the fear that it’ll all be scraped. It’ll all be part of a
  database without my consent. And, of course, that database can be profited off
  of but also misused and abused.” Robyn also had strong concerns about the
  effect of generative AI on the environment. Bown met with students with week
  to discuss their concerns. He told Guardian Australia he couldn’t be happier
  that they were raising concerns, but it was important to interrogate
  generative AI in the creative arts rather than simply casting it off, which he
  expanded on in a Medium post. “If you’re going to have a critical engagement
  with what AI is doing in the creative industries, you should at least know how
  it works.” A spokesperson for UNSW said the university supported the
  “thoughtful integration” of AI technologies in teaching and learning and the
  subject was part of a “broader effort to ensure students are well-equipped to
  navigate an increasingly AI-integrated world”. “As with all UNSW operations,
  the course aligns with the university’s environmental sustainability plan.
  UNSW is a certified carbon-neutral organisation and the university remains
  committed to minimising its environmental footprint.”
