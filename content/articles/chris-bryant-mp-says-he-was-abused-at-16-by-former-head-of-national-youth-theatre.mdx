  The MP Chris Bryant has said he was sexually abused as a teenager by the
  former head of the National Youth Theatre, Michael Croft. The Labour MP, who
  is an arts and telecoms minister, said he was 16 when he was abused by Croft,
  who was around 40 years his senior and died in 1986. In an interview with the
  Sunday Times before the publication of his memoir, Bryant said Croft invited
  him to dinner every evening while he was attending company rehearsals in
  London during the summer of 1978, and that they would go to his house
  afterwards. He recalled coming back from the toilet one evening at Croft’s
  house to find his host naked except for a silk robe. He said Croft then asked
  him for oral sex, which he felt he had no option but to go through with,
  leaving him feeling as if he was “a 16-year-old whore”. “I don’t like telling
  this very much because I’ve not told it very often,” Bryant told the
  newspaper. “It was always the same Italian in King’s Cross. He would eat and
  drink, I would eat, then he would theoretically give me a lift home, except I
  always ended up at his house.” Bryant says Croft never made an advance towards
  him again and that they remained friends. Bryant, who is an ordained minister,
  conducted Croft’s funeral. “He behaved absolutely appallingly, it’s
  despicable,” Bryant said. “Michael, in my case, managed to spot somebody who
  was gay at a time when nearly all homosexuality was illegal – certainly very
  frowned on – so presumed that people would keep a secret.” He said he had at
  least one other friend during his National Youth Theatre days who was also
  abused by Croft and “has been sort of destroyed by it all”. Others have
  previously come forward to the company with allegations of abuse against
  Croft. Bryant told the newspaper that during his years in Westminster he had
  been sexually assaulted by five male MPs, although he has not named or
  reported them. “There was no system for doing so and I was frightened it would
  make me look bad,” he said, adding that he felt homophobia in parliament had
  declined during his 24 years as an MP. A statement on the National Youth
  Theatre website said: “We are grateful to Chris Bryant for disclosing to our
  team the historical abuse he suffered in the company in the 1970s. We are very
  sorry that this happened to him and to others who have previously shared with
  us their accounts of historic abuse by the same perpetrator. “As we set out in
  a public statement on the case in 2017, we stand in solidarity with all
  victims of abuse and encourage anyone who has experienced abuse, no matter how
  long ago, to speak to someone and access support. “In this case the
  perpetrator has been deceased since 1986, but all reports made to us will be
  dealt with in accordance with our robust and formalised safeguarding policy
  and practice.” It continued: “While Chris writes he doesn’t feel damaged by
  what happened, we recognise that being subjected to an abuse of power can have
  lasting consequences for many, in different ways. “Anyone getting in touch
  will be listened to and treated with care and respect by trained
  professionals, in line with our certified trauma-informed practice. “We are
  grateful to Chris for his support of our organisation today, and
  acknowledgment of how different a charity we are in 2025 to the one he
  encountered in the 1970s, with thorough safeguarding practices and policies in
  place.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse
