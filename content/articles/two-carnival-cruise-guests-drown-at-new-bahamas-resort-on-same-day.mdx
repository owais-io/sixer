  Two US nationals in their 70s apparently drowned in two separate incidents on
  Friday at a new resort in the Bahamas, according to officials. The deaths
  happened at Celebration Key, a $600m private destination created for Carnival
  Cruise Line passengers that launched in July about 100 miles (160km) off the
  coast of Florida. “Our lifeguards and medical team responded to two separate
  emergency incidents at Celebration Key on Friday,” one of which was in a
  lagoon and the other of which was on a beach, Carnival Cruise Line said in a
  statement reported by ABC News. “Sadly, both guests have passed away.”
  Authorities reported that the first death occurred shortly before noon. A
  79-year-old man snorkeling off the beach was discovered unresponsive. A
  lifeguard pulled him to shore and tried resuscitation efforts, but he was
  later declared dead by medical doctors, according to a police statement. The
  second drowning happened roughly two and a half hours later. A 74-year-old
  woman was found unconscious while swimming in a pool. A lifeguard performed
  CPR after removing her from the water, and she, too, was pronounced dead.
  Police said autopsies would be conducted to determine the pair’s exact causes
  of death, with investigations still ongoing into both. The victims’ names have
  not been released. Carnival confirmed to Nexstar that the two guests had been
  traveling separately with their families onboard different ships: the Carnival
  Mardi Gras, which departs from Port Canaveral in Orlando; and the Carnival
  Elation, which sails from Jacksonville. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the
  guests and their families, and our care team is providing assistance,” the
  statement from the cruise line said. The company said it was working with law
  enforcement as the investigation proceeds. Besides beaches and lagoons,
  Celebration Key’s various zones include pools, a swing bar and retail areas.
  Carnival projects about 2 million visitors will pass through annually, with
  that number expected to double by 2028.
