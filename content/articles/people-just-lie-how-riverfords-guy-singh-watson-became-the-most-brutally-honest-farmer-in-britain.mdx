  “Cardoons are a perennial crop – they keep coming back every year,” says Guy
  Singh-Watson, as his dog, Artichoke, roots around for voles among the tall
  thistle-like plants. “They would be a dream crop – if only people liked eating
  them.” Cardoons, which Singh-Watson learned to love while snowed in on a
  Sicilian mountain, are not your typical vegetable. But then the Riverford veg
  box founder is not your typical farmer, despite still living only a few miles
  from the farm where he was born. Unlike most farmers, Singh-Watson says we
  need to eat less meat, that large-scale farmers should pay inheritance tax and
  that Brexit has been “a complete and utter fuck-up”. He has opposed
  foxhunting, banned the badger cull from his land and supported the climate
  protesters of Extinction Rebellion. He once even voted for Jeremy Corbyn. When
  it comes to the challenges agriculture faces, he is the most brutally honest
  farmer in the UK. Ploughing this lonely furrow has not limited his success.
  Riverford, now owned by its employees, had a turnover of £113m in 2023-24 and
  made a profit of £5.7m. He has also been awarded farmer of the year by the BBC
  twice. But how did Singh-Watson come to follow this path? In a long
  conversation outside the Riverford Field Kitchen restaurant, he talked to the
  Guardian about his unconventional father, a mother who made good food the
  beating heart of the farm and revealed his autism, diagnosed formally only
  recently. Cucumber stew Gillian and John Watson arrived at Riverford Farm in
  1951, both from colonial families returning home as the British empire faded.
  “My parents wanted to do something useful with their lives, and at a time when
  there was still food rationing,” says Singh-Watson. “They were Liberals all
  their life, in quite an old-school, perhaps almost patronising way … They had
  a social conscience and believed that being wealthy and privileged came with
  responsibilities.” This was not a given, he says. “My father’s family were
  absolutely hideous – the worst sort of rich, wealthy twats and racists. But he
  made something better from that.” His father was always unconventional. “He
  never really wanted to do things the way other people did and was always
  experimenting with different things – we were the first people to have a
  combine harvester in the village. Then he got into pigs in a big way. He was
  always building different housing setups for them, most of which didn’t work.”
  The farm did, like most others, intensify, embracing pesticides and
  fertilisers. “Then, in the 1970s, reading Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and
  through his own observation, he was starting to question farming intensively.”
  Singh-Watson says his father was an “awful cook”, remembering his cucumber
  stew at one meal. His mother had a degree in agriculture and wanted to farm,
  “but those were chauvinist times and she was just the most amazing cook”. She
  made bread and hams, and grew herbs, but was also an experimenter. “She was
  making kombucha in about 1980,” he says. “My mum didn’t survive to eat in the
  Field Kitchen,” he says. The Riverford restaurant, now celebrating its 20th
  year, is the most exceptional part of the business in his opinion. “If she
  had, I think she would have absolutely loved it. It was very much based on
  that experience of growing up in a busy farmhouse with a big, long table,
  where the whole family and half a dozen people from the farm would come and
  eat together: great food from really good ingredients, mostly from the farm.”
  ‘I was unemployable’ The Riverford organic veg business began in 1986 when
  Singh-Watson returned to the family farm for Christmas after giving up a
  management consultancy job in New York. “I had decided by then that I was
  unemployable, that I really couldn’t work for anyone else,” he says. “I’m just
  too pigheaded and stubborn to ever work for anyone else. I also knew I wanted
  to be outside. “People seemed to be talking about organic vegetables and I
  thought, there’s an opportunity here,” he says. He started with three acres.
  His short business career had taught him that controlling the access to market
  was key and in 1993 he decided to deliver the veg direct to customers in an
  old yellow Citroën Dyane. “That was definitely a plan, and also an emotional
  thing, that no one was going to fuck me over like I was fucked over by
  supermarkets and their very unpleasant buyers,” he says. The break came when
  he told a Safeway’s buyer where they could stick their measly 6p per lettuce.
  Since then, Riverford has gone from selling only veg from its own farm to
  founding a co-operative of south Devon organic farms in the late 1990s to
  today, when it works with more than 100 suppliers in the UK and Europe to fill
  its boxes. Singh-Watson got a formal diagnosis of autism in April. “It made me
  feel all the more that I don’t have to live by other people’s rules,” he says.
  “I’m different – so what? I find it really difficult to understand how people
  are able to just lie so easily, and to serve their own ends.” He cites fossil
  fuel and chemical company boards covering up evidence of harm. “I mean, who
  the fuck makes those decisions, knowing that they are fucking the planet for
  their children.” He said the autism diagnosis had helped him understand why
  this upset him so much and why he had never needed the approval of others: “I
  don’t really care.” But Singh-Watson says he has softened with time and the
  help of therapy. “I was definitely like, ‘I’m going to say this because it’s
  true, and I don’t give a fuck if you find it offensive’. But I try not to do
  that now because offending people gratuitously is just stupid and childish
  really.” ‘Just eat less meat’ Singh-Watson may believe he has softened. But
  for many years he has been an iconoclastic voice among farmers. Take meat:
  most British farmers reject calls to eat less red meat to reduce damage to the
  environment and people’s health. Singh-Watson says eat good meat but less
  often: just 5% of what Riverford sells is meat. He had shared an organic
  chicken with eight people the previous evening: “I probably won’t buy another
  one for a month.” “I spent a lot of time looking at the evidence on [the
  impact of meat] and it was overwhelming,” he says. “Ten billion people can’t
  live sustainably on this planet if we are eating anything like the level of
  meat consumed in a western diet. The only answer is we just eat less meat,
  dairy and eggs.” “[Some cattle and sheep farmers] will tell you that that
  grassland is sequestering as much carbon as a rainforest – it’s absolutely
  fucking tosh but it doesn’t stop them saying it,” he says. Singh-Watson’s
  parents were livestock farmers, and his four siblings all work in meat and
  dairy businesses. “I love seeing the cows and sheep in the fields, and I’m not
  a vegan or vegetarian,” he says. “I just think we should try harder to eat
  less meat and to farm in a better way.” ‘Emotive tosh’ That approach has made
  Singh-Watson a rich man: he sold his last share of Riverford to its 1,000
  employees for £10m in 2023 and owns a 150-acre farm nearby. So his support for
  the Labour government’s move to end an exclusion from inheritance tax for
  farms worth more than £1m once again put him at odds with his peers. In
  January, he called protests against the tax change “emotive tosh”. “My
  starting point is that we desperately need to raise tax revenue to rebuild our
  country and rich people, the ones who have been the beneficiaries of all the
  growth the last 20 years, are the people who should be paying it,” he says,
  although he says he would have set the threshold higher than £1m. Under the
  new rules inheritance tax will be levied at 20% – half the standard rate – and
  with 10 years interest-free to pay. “That is a pretty major concession, and if
  you give your land to your children seven years before you die, they don’t pay
  inheritance tax anyway,” Singh-Watson says. “If you’re a farmer owning a
  farmhouse and 200 acres of land, you’re going to be worth at least £3.2m –
  that puts you in the top 1% of wealth in this country,” he says. “And if
  you’re farming 500-acres-plus, and you’re worth £10m, you should pay the whole
  fucking lot – forget the 50% discount. You should just pay your tax like
  anyone else. They are immensely wealthy, and though they are relatively poor
  in terms of income, they do have options. You can sell a field.” He says the
  children of parents owning a family pub, bakery or brewery may be just as
  invested in their business as farmers, but do not get any tax breaks.
  Singh-Watson also backs a wealth tax: “The rich need to pay their share to
  restore the services that are wanted. That’s why I’m a member of Patriotic
  Millionaires UK.” “But the easiest way to get money out of the farming sector
  would be to capture the 100-fold increase in land value when planning
  permission is granted to build houses on it,” he says. “I don’t see why the
  farmer should be the beneficiary of that. Maybe they should get double the
  agricultural value, but the rest of it should go into the public purse.” His
  rough estimate of how much that would raise when the government’s target of
  300,000 new homes are built is £10bn – 25 times more than the inheritance tax
  changes. ‘Crawling back to Europe’ Of all the positions he has taken, opposing
  Brexit brought him the most hate, he says. “But just about everything that I
  said has turned out to be true: it has been a complete and utter fuck-up. How
  can anyone argue anything else? Now we’re having to crawl back to Europe.” He
  excoriates the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. “This alliance between the
  working poor and a load of rich rightwing toffs has been the basis of fascism
  for a century. How can we still be living it out? I find it really upsetting.”
  Singh-Watson says he usually votes Liberal Democrat or Green: “But when I was
  registered in London for a bit, when I was living with my wife there, I
  actually voted for [local MP] Jeremy Corbyn. I’m unsure how I feel about him
  now.” He says the EU’s common agricultural policy was “appalling”, but with
  farming making up only 1% of the UK’s GDP, was not a justification for Brexit
  by itself. “The biggest problem with Brexit is just how incredibly disruptive
  it has been,” he says. “Businesses mostly want government to piss off and
  leave them alone with a stable [regulatory] environment, whether that’s
  workers’ rights, environmental legislation, trading agreements – they just
  want a stable base, and I think Labour have done better than the Tories on
  that.” Singh-Watson has no time for the National Farmers’ Union, by far the
  loudest voice for agriculture in the UK: “I disengaged with the NFU a long
  time ago – all they seem to do is want to protect the status quo. “They
  represent the older, richer, more conservative farmers,” he says. “But there
  are a lot of young people who have a much more radical approach to farming but
  who don’t have access to land. I want to hear their voices, but I think
  they’re completely unrepresented by the NFU.” Expensive luxury? A common
  critique of the kind of organic veg Riveford supplies is that it is an
  expensive luxury, affordable to relatively few people. The real problem,
  counters Singh-Watson, is low incomes and supermarket profits. “The phrase
  ‘food poverty’ infuriates me. We have a real issue with poverty, but very
  little of it has to do with food,” he says. “Most people spend 10% of their
  income on food and for poorer people, it might be 15%.” “But for everyone it’s
  still less than they pay on rent, and how much do we talk about ‘rent
  poverty’?” he says. “The reason people are poor is because they’re not paid
  enough and because housing is too expensive in this country. All the research
  suggests that most people, even people on lower incomes, want to feed their
  families better and they are prepared to pay a bit more for it.” “And what
  about the supermarkets? Why aren’t we talking about what they are sucking out
  of the food chain?” he asks. “Vegetables prices are typically multiplied four
  times between leaving the field and arriving on the supermarket shelf. We’re
  talking about the wrong thing.” Nonetheless, Riverford recently cut the price
  of 20 staple items in its veg boxes. How? “We’re going to make less money,”
  Singh-Watson says. “We were very affordable for a long time – cheaper than
  conventional veg in Tesco – but that came with compromises” on staff pay and
  being green, he says. “Arguably, over the last five to 10 years, we’ve swung
  the other way, and we’re absolutely uncompromising.” Forty years on from its
  founding, what does Singh-Watson hope the coming decades will bring for
  Riverford? “In an ideal world, it would be commercially successful without
  compromising on its values, and thereby show that it is possible to do
  business in a different way,” he says. “The No 1 thing I want to show is that
  unregulated, brutal capitalism is not the way forward, and that we can behave
  another way. I would go as far as to say the future of our planet depends on
  it.” The last chapter of his late father’s life was establishing a low-carbon
  commune, collecting waifs and strays, says Singh-Watson. Now at 65, he says:
  “I don’t want to retire but I like doing stuff that I can get my arms around
  and say I did that. I’ve been building stone walls for the last month, and
  nothing makes me happier.” Going around the fields picking veg and then going
  home to cook it, as his mother did, also makes him very happy. As for the
  cardoons, Singh-Watson recommends frying the tough, bitter leaf stems in
  breadcrumbs with a Sicilian dip called bagna cauda, made of olive oil, garlic
  and anchovies: “All the best food is peasant food.”
