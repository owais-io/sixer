  Union leaders representing 10,000 striking flight attendants have said they
  would be willing to go to jail rather than comply with an order to return to
  work, as Canada’s federal government seeks to end a bitter contract dispute
  that has halted hundreds of summer flights and stranded travellers around the
  world. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the national president of the Canadian
  Union of Public Employees said members would remain on the picket lines as
  part of a work stoppage that has halted Air Canada’s national and
  international operations during its busiest season. “There’s no limit. We’re
  going to stay strong. We’re going to stay committed to making sure those
  workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof
  over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” said Mark Hancock.
  “And if means folks like me going to jail, then so be it.” Hancock said
  members want a solution, “but that solution has to be found at a bargaining
  table”. Flight attendants with Air Canada went on strike on Saturday after
  months of failed negotiations with Canada’s flagship carrier over wages. Ahead
  of the work stoppage, Air Canada warned that a shutdown could affect 130,000
  people a day. Less than 12 hours after the strike took effect, however, the
  country’s jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, used her broad powers to impose binding
  arbitration on both parties – a move the union representing flight attendants
  decried as unconstitutional. “The talks broke down,” Hajdu told reporters over
  the weekend. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving
  some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the
  arbitrator.” Air Canada initially said it planned to resume flights on Sunday,
  but the union said it would defy the government’s back-to-work order and
  accused the governing Liberal party of trampling on workers’ rights and
  setting a “terrible” precedent. “The Liberals have talked out of both sides of
  their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table.
  They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,” Wesley
  Lesosky, a senior member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a
  statement. “Now, when we’re at the bargaining table with an obstinate
  employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and
  give Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from
  underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and
  extraordinary executive compensation.” Following an emergency hearing on
  Sunday requested by Air Canada, the industrial relations board sided with the
  federal government and airline. “The members of the union’s bargaining unit
  are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to
  refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” according to a directive
  from the board. The union said it intends to challenge government-imposed
  binding arbitration in a federal court. If they defy the order from the labour
  board, union heads can be arrested and union members face the prospect of
  steep fines. The prime minister, Mark Carney, said it was “disappointing” the
  stalled negotiations had not yielded a new contract. “We recognize very much
  the critical role that flight attendants play in keeping Canadians and their
  families safe as they travel, comfortable as they travel,” Carney told
  reporters on Monday. “And it’s important that they’re compensated equitably at
  all times, fairly at all times.” On Monday morning, Air Canada said it hoped
  to resume flights later in the day, but also suspended its financial guidance
  for the third quarter and its full year due to the shutdown. The strike is
  expected to cost the airline tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings each
  day.
