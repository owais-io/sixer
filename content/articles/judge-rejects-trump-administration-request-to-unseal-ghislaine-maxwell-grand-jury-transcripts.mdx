  jury transcripts

  Dismissing it as little more than a “diversion”, a federal judge in New York
  has formally rejected the Trump-led US justice department’s request to release
  transcripts of pre-indictment, grand jury interviews with witnesses in the
  case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker and associate of
  Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that the transcripts could not be
  released publicly – “casually or promiscuously” – as Donald Trump’s government
  had pushed for because it would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy
  upon which the grand jury is premised”. Nonetheless, while Engelmayer said
  that releasing the transcripts would jeopardize the confidence of people
  called to testify before grand juries, he also made it a point to write that
  the transcripts were “redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial”.
  Engelmayer also said that the government did not identify information of
  consequence in the record that was not already public in its request to
  release the Maxwell case’s grand jury testimony. That observation raises
  questions about whether the Trump administration meant to substantially
  address the bipartisan calls for transparency in Epstein’s case through its
  move for the transcripts’ release. And Engelmayer sought to answer those
  questions in his ruling. “A member of the public, appreciating that the
  Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge,
  might conclude that the government’s motion for their unsealing was aimed not
  at ‘transparency’ but at diversion – aimed not at full disclosure but at the
  illusion of such,” he wrote. “Contrary to the government’s depiction, the
  Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or
  public interest,” he added. “Far from it. It consists of garden-variety
  summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.” Brad Edwards, a Florida
  lawyer who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, told the
  Associated Press that he did not disagree with Engelmayer’s ruling Monday.
  “Our only concern was that if materials were released, then maximum protection
  for the victims was essential,” he said. “The grand jury materials contain
  very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.” Trump’s administration
  had requested the release of grand jury transcripts in July amid intense
  political heat around the investigation of Epstein – the late financier and
  convicted pedophile – and his co-conspirator Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year
  prison sentence. Members of the president’s Republican party joined the calls
  for his administration to resolve questions about the scandal, some of which
  center on him. Maxwell recently was interviewed by the deputy attorney
  general, Todd Blanche, and soon after was moved from a prison in Florida to a
  lower-security prison in Texas, prompting accusations that a cover-up of
  evidence linking Epstein to Trump was in progress. An attorney for Maxwell
  says she spoke truthfully to Blanche. The lead prosecutor in the 2022 case
  against Maxwell, Maurene Comey, was dismissed from the southern district of
  New York federal prosecutor’s office before the interview took place. The
  request to unseal the testimony has been seen as an incremental measure: the
  government has acknowledged it contains no testimony from witnesses who
  weren’t members of law enforcement. But thousands of other documents and
  electronic files are in the government’s possession. In early July, the US
  justice department and FBI released a memo stating they found no evidence of
  an Epstein “client list” or blackmail – and that no further materials would be
  released to protect victims. Yet the fight over Epstein-Maxwell grand jury
  testimony is not complete. A federal judge in Florida is looking at releasing
  transcripts from the grand jury testimony that led to an earlier federal
  indictment against Epstein – from 2006 – that was later shelved. To resolve
  that case, Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting
  minors and entered into a non-prosecution agreement to protect himself and
  four named others from future prosecution. Maxwell has appealed her conviction
  to the US supreme court, claiming she should have been shielded under that
  earlier agreement. But a number of avenues remain open. The Republican-led
  House oversight committee has subpoenaed the justice department and issued
  subpoenas to Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton – who Trump defeated in 2016 to
  secure his first presidency – and eight former top law enforcement officials
  to appear before the committee in the fall.
