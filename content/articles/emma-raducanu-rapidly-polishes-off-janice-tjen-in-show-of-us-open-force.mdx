  On her return to Flushing Meadows this year, Emma Raducanu felt the full force
  of the tension and nerves that accompanied her determination to finally change
  the narrative surrounding her career and thrive in New York again. However,
  Raducanu has also never been more prepared for such challenges. She continues
  to show off the fruits of her recent labour by putting together another
  devastating performance, demolishing the qualifier Janice Tjen 6-2, 6-1 to
  return to the third round of the US Open. The challenge for Raducanu on
  Wednesday was figuring out a talented but unheralded opponent who few players
  in the tournament have had the opportunity to watch, let alone compete
  against. Once again, the British No 1 showed her best form since winning the
  title here in 2021 here and that confidence is growing with every victory.
  Another dominant showing on Louis Armstrong Stadium was spearheaded by a
  supreme serving performance from Raducanu, which allowed her to step inside
  the baseline and dominate until the end. This had been billed as a deceptively
  difficult match-up against an opponent whose ranking of No 149 belies her form
  and quality. Despite being just six months older than Raducanu, the
  23-year-old Tjen only turned professional last June after opting to take the
  US college route. Starting from the lowest rung of the ITF circuit, and
  receiving no wildcards, Tjen had compiled a 95-10 record over the past 15
  months. From being unranked last June, she now stands at No 149. Tjen’s
  playing style bears more than a passing resemblance to one of the most unique
  champions of the 21st century: Ash Barty. Tjen similarly pairs a potent,
  spinny forehand with a nasty, varied backhand slice and a willingness for
  pushing forward to the net. She played a brilliant opening-round match to
  topple the 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova, her victory marking her as the
  first Indonesian player to win a grand slam main draw match in 22 years. Much
  like in her devastating opening-round win over Ena Shibahara, however,
  Raducanu burst into the match producing a high level from the beginning. She
  opened by serving spectacularly well, ending the set with 76% of first-serve
  ins, winning 84% of those first-serve points and firing down five aces in her
  four service games. Raducanu’s confidence behind her serve imbued her with the
  freedom to swing more freely on her groundstrokes. She put the excellent Tjen
  backhand slice under relentless pressure throughout the set with her
  cross-court backhand, striking the ball early and cleanly as she continuously
  pinned the Indonesian in her backhand corner. The straightforward opening set
  further inspired the most aggressive version of Raducanu, who forced herself
  even further inside the baseline, taking bigger cuts of the ball earlier in
  the point. She smothered Tjen with her offence, who has no experience of
  competing against an opponent playing at such a high level and pace. In recent
  months, Raducanu has stressed the importance of her improving the quality of
  her shots and not relying on her court sense and fighting spirit. The quality
  of Raducanu’s serving, the cleanliness of her groundstrokes and the way she
  bullied a lower-ranked opponent from on top of the baseline from start to
  finish underlines her continued. A far greater barometer may await, however,
  as she will face the winner of the second round match between Elena Rybakina,
  the ninth seed and 2022 Wimbledon champion, and another qualifier in Tereza
  Valentova. This report will update
