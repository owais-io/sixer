  Neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell has been arrested outside a Melbourne court over an
  alleged attack on Camp Sovereignty, a sacred Aboriginal burial ground in Kings
  Domain and longstanding protest site on Sunday. Victoria police have confirmed
  detectives from the Melbourne crime investigation unit arrested Sewell, 32,
  and two associates – a 23-year-old man from Mooroolbark and a 20-year-old man
  from Ardeer – outside Melbourne’s magistrates court about 3.20pm on Tuesday.
  “They are being interviewed in relation to an ongoing investigation into
  alleged assaults in King’s Domain about 5pm on 31 August,” police said. No
  charges have been laid. Sewell, the leader of the National Socialist Network,
  was in court for the second day of a three-day contested hearing related to
  charges of intimidating police and breaching multiple personal intervention
  orders. He was representing himself in the matter before magistrate Michelle
  Hodgson. Prior to his appearance in court and his subsequent arrest, Sewell
  confronted the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, as she was holding a press
  conference at Eades Park in West Melbourne with the treasurer, Jaclyn Symes,
  and upper house MP Sheena Watt. He was separated from the premier by her
  security detail and the trio quickly left the park, with the press conference
  abandoned. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, speaking at a party room
  meeting of Labor MPs in Canberra immediately after the incident, branded it
  “horrific”. In a statement, Allan said she was “unharmed and undeterred” after
  the press conference. “It comes as no surprise that Nazis oppose me and my
  government. I wear that as a badge of honour,” she said. “But this isn’t about
  me. It’s about all the other people in the community who Nazis target – like
  multicultural people, LGBTIQA+ people, First Peoples and Jews. “They’re the
  Victorians who are on my mind right now, and they’re the Victorians who our
  anti-hate laws will protect when they come into force later this month.” Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email Allan said there was “no place for hate” in the
  state and she would continue to be “out and about in public” fighting for all
  Victorians’ “right to belong”. “I am not afraid. We know how these goons
  operate. They whip up fear to divide our society. They will fail. Because
  Victorians are fair, and our values are strong,” she said. Later on Tuesday,
  she met with multicultural and multi-faith groups in Hampton Park, in
  Melbourne’s southeast. “Memo to no one in particular: this is what the real
  Victoria looks like. And we’re better for it,” she posted on X. “Different
  families, different faiths, but the same Victorian values: love for our
  neighbours, respect for each other, and pride in ourselves.” Allan was
  answering questions on the incident at Camp Sovereignty, and Sewell’s role in
  the rally, at the time he approached her. Speaking generally, she had
  condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism” that occurred at the
  weekend and announced she would be convening an anti-hate taskforce with
  Victoria police in response. “The anti-hate taskforce [will] both look at the
  incidents over the weekend, but also understand too, that this goes beyond
  just being a law and order issue. There is something deeper going on here,”
  Allan said. “People’s sense of economic security is being exploited by a small
  number of people, who are wanting to use cracks in our society and exploit
  them to drive division in our society.” She said it had a been a “tough time”
  for many Australians but the solution was “not what this small number of
  people are trying to sell”. “The pathway to social cohesion is in building a
  stronger society, a place where people have jobs, people have rights and are
  respected,” Allan said. During the ambush, Sewell falsely claimed that 50,000
  people attended the anti-immigration March for Australia in Melbourne on
  Sunday. Victoria police estimated about 5,000 people attended the march and
  counter rallies. He also falsely claimed Australians did not have the right to
  protest, despite being able to deliver a speech to the anti-immigration rally
  from the front steps of the Victorian parliament. – with AAP
