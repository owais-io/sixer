  The chief executive of the UK Advertising Standards Authority has issued a
  plea to advertisers to avoid using “irresponsible” images of unhealthily
  thin-looking models. Guy Parker, CEO of the UK watchdog, said adverts where
  models appeared to present an unhealthy body image were “becoming more of an
  issue” and called upon advertisers to “please, please, please think very
  carefully” about the body types they depicted. Recently, the regulator banned
  adverts from high street retailers including M&amp;S, Next and Zara for
  presenting “irresponsible” images of models who appeared “unhealthily thin”.
  The regulator reported that in one of the images used by M&amp;S in April, a
  model “wore large pointed shoes which emphasised the slenderness of her legs”.
  A downwards tilting camera angle made the model’s head appear “out of
  proportion with the rest of her body and further highlighted her small frame”.
  In response, M&amp;S said it “took concerns about the depiction of body image
  in [its] ads very seriously”. The shoes had “only been chosen for stylistic
  and fashion purposes” while the camera angle “had not been chosen to
  exaggerate the model’s proportions”. The watchdog typically receives five or
  six complaints a week about such ads, but after the ruling against M&amp;S in
  July that increased to more than 20. In 2024, it received a total of 61
  complaints about the size of models in adverts. According to the ASA, 45% of
  the UK public are concerned about ads that include idealised body images of
  women. Parker, who has worked for the ASA for more than 30 years, said a wider
  “return to thinness in fashion” was causing an increase in complaints. “It is
  not unprecedented,” he said. “Fashion trends go in cycles. In the 90s we had a
  ‘heroin chic’ period and we banned several ads back then. Our rules have long
  required ads to be socially responsible. It may be that we’re kind of back in
  that sort of space today.” The rise of weight-loss medication may also be
  affecting the types of bodies being portrayed in ads. “There is a connection
  between the two,” said Parker, who is overseeing a project focusing on
  injectable versions. “There have been too many cases of advertisers, many of
  whom should know better, promoting prescription-only weight-loss medicines to
  the public. That is against the law and our codes.” The watchdog has
  previously been accused of double standards for allowing campaigns starring
  plus-size models, with some online critics calling such models obese. Parker
  said a wider cultural context played a part here. “We know in the UK
  currently, society tends to view thinness as aspirational. That’s not the same
  case when it comes to being overweight.” Parker said it was important not to
  “demonise the models that have been featured in ads”. The rulings are
  generally not about the model’s body but about how advertisers may have
  manipulated images of a model. Lighting, makeup and the type of poses used all
  play a role. Parker said the final images selected for use was crucial,
  pointing to a recent ruling against Zara as an example of this. In four
  adverts, starring two models, the ASA found that shadows used over one of the
  model’s legs made them “appear noticeably thin”, while the low-cut design of a
  shirt worn by the other model created “a focal point around her collarbone,
  which was protruding”. Two other adverts starring the same models did not
  breach its code. Responding to the ruling, Zara said during its hiring process
  both models had provided medical certificates proving they were in good
  health. Parker said: “The key moment is when you are selecting the images
  because there will probably be a whole bunch of images of the model you can
  use but there might be some that you shouldn’t. It comes down to these
  advertisers making sure that they have got a stage in their compliance process
  that actively and consciously checks to make sure irresponsible images don’t
  slip through.” Noticeable bones are especially contentious. “We have had
  issues where ribs are really visible. Sometimes it is very thin-looking arms
  or thin-looking legs. I say thin-looking rather than thin because it is about
  how models are presented in clothes, not the model per se.” Parker said “thin”
  was subjective. “I don’t think any of these advertisers are intentionally
  promoting this sort of concept of unhealthy thinness. But that can sometimes
  be the result if they are not really careful about the images they select to
  use.”
