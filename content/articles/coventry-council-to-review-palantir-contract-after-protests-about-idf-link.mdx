  The first UK council to appoint the US technology company Palantir to deploy
  artificial intelligence (AI) into its systems is reviewing the contract after
  protests by workers and councillors over its links to the Israel Defense
  Forces (IDF). The review of the £500,000-a-year deal with the company
  co-founded by the Donald Trump donor Peter Thiel was announced by Coventry
  city council’s Labour leadership on Tuesday after the Guardian first reported
  concerns. Palantir is also involved in the US government’s immigration
  crackdown and helps to manage data in the NHS. Trade unions representing
  teachers and other workers protested against the contract outside a full
  council meeting on Tuesday, when they were told by deputy council leader Abdul
  Khan: “We are reviewing the Palantir contract … and I personally agree with
  the sentiments regarding the divestment of all funds which are being used in
  the genocide all across the world, particularly at the moment in Gaza. So,
  whenever this is brought before the council, I will be supporting your
  concerns and agreeing with what you’ve said.” The contract with the
  Colorado-based company started in February and followed a pilot scheme in the
  council’s children’s services department, including using AI for case-note
  transcription and to summarise social workers’ records. The council had said
  it was planning to extend the system and “explore the transformative
  opportunities of artificial intelligence”. The review was confirmed by the
  cabinet member for finance, Richard Brown. But he insisted that, with the
  council losing £1.6bn in spending power since 2010 and many local authorities
  facing effective bankruptcies – known as section 114 – “we simply cannot
  afford to stand still and do nothing”. “For any council to fail to find
  smarter, better and cheaper ways to offer our 700-plus services is a one-way
  street to section 114 land,” he said. “AI is a valuable tool that has the
  potential to make the right changes.” Unions are concerned that AI systems
  could replace human workers. Coventry recently started using Palantir’s AI to
  screen applications for household support funds. Asked if there would be job
  losses from the Palantir contract, Brown said: “I can’t comment on that.”
  Palantir said last week that the early signs from the contract showed
  “potential for a significant reduction in the admin burden”. Councillor Grace
  Lewis had complained that it was “indefensible that the council entered into a
  contract with Palantir, a company infamous for its role in providing weapons
  and surveillance to the IDF and its role in NHS privatisation, at a time when
  the council has made cuts to the public and voluntary sector”. At a public
  forum in May, Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, was challenged over the
  company’s contracts with Israel’s military and told: “Your technology kills
  Palestinians.” He replied: “That’s true, mostly terrorists.” Lewis welcomed
  the commitment to review the Palantir contract, but said it was disappointing
  that Brown was “unable to recognise the harmful nature of the contract and
  also has failed to rule out job losses associated if this contract was to
  continue”. She added: “This review must be urgent, transparent and include
  campaigners – with clear outcomes within four weeks.” Palantir was approached
  for comment.
