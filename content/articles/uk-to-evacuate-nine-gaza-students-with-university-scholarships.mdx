  Nine students in Gaza with full scholarships to study at British universities
  have been told the UK government is working to facilitate their evacuation.
  The students – who have all been awarded Chevening scholarships, funded by the
  Foreign Office in recognition of their potential as future leaders – welcomed
  the development on Wednesday, but dozens more Palestinians in Gaza with
  university places are still awaiting news. The breakthrough follows months of
  advocacy and campaigning by more than 100 MPs, university leaders and other
  civil society organisations. More than 80 Palestinian students in total have
  offers at UK universities, including 40 who have secured full scholarships. Dr
  Nora Parr, a researcher at the University of Birmingham who has been
  coordinating efforts to support the students, said: “We received news of the
  government plans with mixed emotions. On the one hand, relief that indeed
  there is a shared sense of the importance and urgency of the students’
  situation – and on the other our hearts sank. What about the rest? We must
  believe that this is only a start.” Khulud, 28, who has a place at University
  College London to study for a master’s degree in dental health, said:
  “Receiving the news about the evacuation today was overwhelming.” The students
  have been unable to travel and begin their studies because of a Home Office
  requirement for biometric data for a visa application. The UK-authorised
  biometrics registration centre in Gaza closed in October 2023 and it has been
  impossible for them to travel to other centres in neighbouring countries.
  Other countries, including Italy, Ireland and France, have already evacuated
  students. It is understood the British government is considering requests for
  support from other Palestinian students with places at UK universities.
  “Through all these struggles, our voices are finally being heard,” said
  Khulud. “Nothing we have endured has been in vain. I hope these steps are
  completed smoothly so that we can join our studies on time.” Of her fellow
  students who are still waiting, she said: “I hope their determination is
  recognised, and that they too receive the support they deserve to continue
  their studies and achieve their dreams.” A government spokesperson said: “We
  are working urgently to support Chevening scholars in Gaza who have offers
  from British universities to leave and take up their places in the UK. “We are
  doing everything we can to support their safe exit and onward travel to the UK
  but the situation on the ground in Gaza makes this extremely challenging.”
