  Forty-two per cent of the married couples you know are destined to divorce,
  according to the latest UK statistics, but we still buy into the idea that a
  wedding is a happy ending. The story we like to tell, culturally, about
  romantic love is straightforward: that there is just one person out there for
  everyone, and that, once you have found that person, you will be happy every
  day until one of you is dead. So what about people who rack up multiple
  marriages? The famous stories tend to have a whiff of madness and glamour
  about them. There is Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times (twice to
  Richard Burton). The other, bloodier, example that springs to mind is Henry
  VIII. To be married and divorced multiple times requires a strange mixture of
  romanticism and practicality about love. Saying “until death do us part”
  again, with four ex-husbands still living, suggests that you believe the right
  marriage might save you. But also that deep down you know it won’t. I started
  looking for stories of serial spouses in the aftermath of a breakup with a man
  I had wanted to marry, and there was a part of me that hoped that speaking to
  these people might loosen the hold that marriage has over my own imagination.
  Why do so many of us aspire to an institution with a 58% success rate, at
  best? And why do I feel like a failure because I haven’t achieved it? Serial
  brides and grooms might find the idea of marriage especially seductive – but I
  suspected that they might also be clear-eyed about love, and its limits, in a
  way that most of us are not. The dream of the perfect wedding, and the perfect
  marriage, can be particularly hard to resist if you are a woman. At first I
  was surprised to find so many serial brides on internet message boards. I had
  a stereotype in my head of the man who cycles through women, trading in each
  new wife for a younger model. But when I actually connected with interviewees,
  it began to make sense to me. Anita, who has been married six times, told me
  that she walked down the aisle for the first time at 18 because she was
  frightened people would think there was something wrong with her if she wasn’t
  chosen by a man. When her first marriage broke down, Anita kept getting
  remarried, because to be a divorced woman in the European town in which she
  grew up was to be a kind of social outcast. A 2019 book by the behavioural
  scientist Paul Dolan drew on data suggesting that women who don’t marry or
  have children are happier and healthier than those who do, but there is still
  a perception that single women are broken or unfulfilled. For men, a solid
  relationship is one of a number of ingredients that make for a good life, but
  many of the women I interviewed for this piece were raised – like me – to view
  marriage as their crowning achievement. Marriage is seductive for irrational,
  emotional reasons – but it is also incentivised by the state. In the UK,
  married couples are eligible for tax breaks and, in the US, married couples
  are allowed to use their spouse’s medical insurance, so a marriage certificate
  can mean access to life-saving medical care. Carys, a 73-year-old American
  divorce attorney who has herself been divorced seven times, was transparent
  with me about the fact that marriage, for her, is partly a financial
  proposition. When she first got married, in 1972, marriage put women at a
  disadvantage: marital rape was still legal in most US states, and women
  generally lost any claim to shared property in the event of a divorce.
  Speaking to me via video link from her home office, Carys explained that she
  kept remarrying because she wanted to prove to herself that she had value, and
  that she could find love but she was also insistent that a marriage should be
  about something more tangible than romance. “If you’re a divorce lawyer you’re
  not really so into the ‘until death do us part’ bit of marriage,” she
  explained. “It’s more something you do to make yourself financially and
  emotionally safe in the event that things go south.” Carys has filed six out
  of seven of her own divorces, and used to keep the paperwork sitting in a file
  on her desk until needed, like a kind of security blanket. “As an attorney
  who’d handled divorces for hundreds of other people, I always felt able to
  quickly and painlessly escape.” Carys is happily married to husband number
  eight. She spoke to me anonymously, and doesn’t always disclose her marital
  history to clients. Similarly, Anita, who lives in Scotland, keeps her
  multiple divorces a secret – Anita is not her real name. Other than her sixth
  husband, the only person who knows the full story of her past is her priest.
  Even the people who did agree to be photographed in these pages expressed
  anxiety about being judged. Serial brides and grooms are cast as unstable and
  morally weak, which is strange – because the people I spoke to struck me as
  being unusually courageous. Many of us grit our teeth and struggle on through
  a bad relationship, or numb ourselves to our own unhappiness, because we are
  afraid of being alone. People who marry multiple times aren’t willing to
  remain in a bad relationship for the sake of propriety. They seem less afraid
  to change and to admit defeat than the rest of us are. The serial spouses I
  interviewed also seemed unusually hopeful. Recovering from any breakup
  requires a certain amount of resilience. You put yourself back together and
  try to believe in love all over again. But buying a wedding dress, sending out
  invitations and saying “I do” in front of everyone you know – for the fifth or
  sixth time – requires an extraordinary amount of hope. Many of the people who
  share their experiences below are currently happily married – so what follows
  is really a series of offbeat, non‑traditional love stories. They are a
  testament to the value of the pursuit of love, rather than its attainment –
  and a reminder that a wedding is never really a happy ending. It’s only a
  beginning. *** ‘My sixth and cheapest wedding was happier than all the others
  put together’ Lacey, 39 (married six times) Fairytale weddings do not always
  make for good marriages. I’ve been married six times and that is one thing I
  have had to learn the hard way. I’ve done his’n’hers matching wedding outfits.
  I’ve done exotic-location weddings. I’ve done the big-white-dress wedding,
  three times. Sometimes I think I actually used the wedding planning as a way
  of escaping from the fact that I was marrying the wrong person. The first time
  I got married I was only 18, and I wore the same white dress I’d put on six
  weeks earlier for my high-school graduation. I knew even on our wedding day
  that I didn’t truly love my husband. I’m almost certain he knew he didn’t
  truly love me. But I was thrilled by the idea of having a husband and being
  someone’s wife. I have never been religious, but I had this ingrained idea
  that the marriage ceremony would magically bind us together. I had spent my
  childhood feeling lonely, and I was frightened of remaining alone. Of course,
  it didn’t work out like I’d dreamed. Husband No 1 cheated on me, which I truly
  don’t blame him for – considering he was 20 years old and we were both
  clueless kids. My mother went to high school with a top divorce attorney, so I
  ended up getting a payout. That attorney taught me a lesson that stood me in
  good stead for all my subsequent divorces: the partner who files for divorce
  first wins the case. It means you have your ducks in a row and you’ve snapped
  up the best attorney. That sounds a little heartless, but you can’t get around
  the fact that, in America, marriage is unavoidably about money. By my 27th
  birthday, I had been married and divorced three times and I was engaged again.
  My fourth husband’s family paid for that wedding, which was my biggest yet. It
  was on a yacht and it cost $40,000. I was wearing a gorgeous corset-backed
  dress with a mermaid skirt, but I remember feeling sick because I knew that
  even though my husband and I looked picture-perfect we were already falling
  apart. It had become clear that I didn’t really know him, and he was growing
  colder and more withdrawn, but I felt like I had to go through with the
  marriage because the invitations had been sent out, and people were sending me
  gifts. I filed for divorce after only a year. By the time I was organising my
  fifth wedding my parents were getting tired of my constant marriages. They
  just said, “OK, you’re getting married again. We’re not going to come to this
  one.” That marriage still wasn’t a success, but at least the wedding day was
  more low‑key. It was a courthouse ceremony, with only his parents in
  attendance. I was pregnant, which was the only reason I went through with it.
  I had grown up over the course of my previous four marriages. I no longer had
  any faith that the ceremony was going to transform us into a perfect couple –
  but I wanted to at least give our kid a chance at a traditional mother-father
  setup. That marriage lasted less than a year. At 29, I started dating again,
  but I decided it was time to be brutally honest. I wrote on my dating profile
  that any boyfriend would have to come second to my daughter, and that I didn’t
  have much time to spare. I matched with Jonathan, and I remember promising
  myself that I wasn’t going to put on any kind of front. I think I told him I’d
  been married five times previously over text, before we even met in person. He
  reacted with such openness. He had this beautiful, soft expression in his
  teddy bear-brown eyes, and he listened. Jonathan was so curious about me –
  which felt amazing, because I’d shown him something true. I married Jonathan
  one and a half years after our first date, and we both wore jeans and
  T-shirts. The whole thing cost $120. We bought our rings from Amazon for $20,
  paid the magistrate $40, and filed the paperwork for $60. It was my sixth and
  cheapest wedding, and happier than all the others put together. I used to
  dread the everydayness of being in a couple: the bills and laundry. But even
  bills and laundry can be kind of wonderful, when you’re with the right person.
  It just took me six attempts to find him. Jonathan, 44 (married twice) The
  first thing that struck me about Lacey is that she wears her heart on her
  sleeve. When she told me she had five marriages behind her, I was a little
  taken aback, but I was more disarmed by her ability to just say something like
  that to a stranger. She seemed courageous, but also had a vulnerability to
  her. She had no wall up whatsoever, and she wasn’t interested in playing
  games. I used to find it difficult to tell the truth all the time, about every
  little thing that goes through my head, but Lacey makes it feel possible
  because she started us off that way. I had been married once before, when I
  was 21. It was a very beautiful, elaborate wedding in an imposing building in
  Virginia, in the middle of these immaculate grounds, but even when I think
  about that day now I feel anxious. The richness felt superficial to me. My
  ex-wife and I were always more like roommates than real lovers. I wanted to
  escape from my home town, and so did she, and we were marrying to give us both
  a kind of alibi to present to our respective parents. My ex and I had a
  Catholic ceremony, and there was a moment in the middle where we both had to
  light a candle. I tried to light mine about five times but it wouldn’t work. I
  remember thinking: it’s a sign! When I married Lacey, at 36, there was no
  fuss. She didn’t even wear a dress. My T-shirt said “I’m her Jack” and hers
  said “I’m his Sally”, because we’re both massive Nightmare Before Christmas
  fans. Standing in front of the justice of the peace in T-shirts felt so much
  more meaningful to me than all the fanfare of my previous wedding, because
  what we had together was real. I didn’t feel nervous at all. I had this
  amazing sense of calm. Lacey may have been married five times before she met
  me, but all five of her marriages add up to about 11 years in total, which is
  roughly the same length of time as my first marriage. So to my mind we’re
  even. Sometimes I think about how easy it would have been for Lacey and I to
  have never met, and it frightens me. We grew up in different states, and if we
  hadn’t happened to have logged into the same dating site at the same time, I
  never would have known that she existed. If anything, I feel strangely
  grateful for her five previous marriages, because they led her to me. *** ‘She
  is slow and steady with her love, whereas I am an incurable romantic’ Joseph,
  85 (married five times) My friends used to crack jokes about the fact that I
  was the man who couldn’t stop getting married. I’ve been divorced four times,
  and there was a perception that there must be something very wrong with me, to
  have failed to make so many marriages work. I don’t think the comments were
  entirely fair. There were undoubtedly things wrong with me, but I was a work
  in progress. I’ve been happily married to my fifth wife, Emily, for decades,
  and, while I attribute the success of our marriage to the fact that Emily and
  I are such a good fit, I also think I have age to thank for it. I met Emily
  when I was 55 and I knew myself in a way you simply can’t at 25. I was 29 when
  I left my first wife. During our five‑year marriage our life looked like a
  1950s vision of the American dream. The problem was that it wasn’t 1950, it
  was 1968, and the culture was changing. I was working as a cab driver in San
  Francisco, and I was fascinated by the hippies I saw out on the streets.
  People were protesting over the brutality of Vietnam, and reeling from the
  death of Martin Luther King. I didn’t want to live my traditional American
  life any more. So I became a hippy and joined the movement. My first wife was
  deeply shocked by the way I wanted to live. We argued about it intensely.
  Looking back, I see the way I handled that divorce as one of my failures. I
  wish I had been kinder, but I wanted so badly to remake my life. My second
  marriage was the polar opposite of my first. My wife and I lived with 40 other
  hippies in a house with no running water. Politically we were opposed to
  marriage, and we only went through with it for financial reasons. The marriage
  lasted for five years, and there were many wonderful things about it – but
  ultimately we fell apart. Drugs were a part of our lifestyle, and they
  intensified a propensity I had within me from childhood to feel hard done by.
  My second wife left me because she couldn’t cope with my anger, and I don’t
  blame her. I stopped experimenting with drugs, and distanced myself from the
  hippy lifestyle – but I was in a state of mourning for my second marriage for
  many years. When I started dating again, my goal was to remarry. Even though I
  had tried to reject the 1950s values instilled in me by my parents, it was
  deeply ingrained in me that marriage was the right way to do a long‑term
  relationship. So I tried again, twice more, between the ages of 43 and 50. My
  fourth wedding was a big hoopla because my wife-to-be wanted a huge shindig. I
  think my family’s misgivings about my ability to make a relationship work
  really peaked when that marriage failed. I met Emily when I was 55, and I
  asked her to marry me several times in our first years together. She always
  said no. She is slow and steady with her love, whereas I am an incurable
  romantic. Finally, out of the blue one day, Emily said she would marry me –
  and I couldn’t set the date fast enough. Emily and I don’t try to change one
  another, and I think that is because we met as middle-aged people, rather than
  as inexperienced 20-year-olds. We celebrate our 30th anniversary next year, so
  my friends certainly aren’t laughing at me any more. Emily, 76 (married once)
  I was 46 when I met Joseph, and I had never been married, because to my mind a
  wedding wasn’t something to aspire to. My mother always told me that if she
  could do it all over again, she would have remained single. My father was an
  upright man, but marriage had transformed her life into endless drudgery. I
  also came of age in the 1970s feminist movement, so it didn’t seem safe to me
  to emotionally involve myself with a man, and lose myself in a relationship. I
  had deep relationships in my 20s and 30s, but I also enjoyed the excitement of
  the sexual revolution. We had the pill. We felt so wonderfully free. But,
  around the time I met Joseph, I was looking for something more long-term and
  stable. So I put a little ad in my local paper, seeking a man who was “kind”,
  “gainfully employed” and “under 6ft tall” – because I didn’t want to have to
  stretch too much to kiss him. Joseph sent me a letter via the newspaper, and I
  remember liking his writing style. He also was – and still is – very
  good-looking. I found out later that Joseph had Xeroxed that very same letter
  and sent it out to a number of different women who had posted newspaper ads,
  but by that time he had won me over. It was surprising to me that Joseph had
  been married four times previously. I would have been less shocked if he had
  had 1,000 ex-lovers, because exploration of that nature was more familiar to
  me. The ex-wives seemed weirder, in a way, because they suggested that he
  believed in marriage – which I did not. But as I heard the full story of every
  marriage, Joseph’s history began to make more sense to me. He is intensely
  romantic, whereas I would describe myself as a “careful romantic”. I want to
  make sure everything is safe before I throw myself in. After a few years I
  thought: why not? I was convinced by that time that I would be spending my
  life with him, and I knew it would make him happy. We are deeply affectionate
  with one another, and cuddle and kiss all the time, even after 29 years
  together. But, still, falling in love wasn’t a mad, emotional rush for me. I
  was practical and thoughtful about it. Joseph’s romanticism is offset by my
  clear-headedness, and it works. We balance one another out. *** ‘All my
  marriages ended because I underwent some kind of personal change’ Jan, 70
  (married five times) I ended up getting married five times, a fact that was so
  shocking to my mother that she simply never mentioned it. My parents never had
  much money, but they were proud of their morals. I got married for the first
  time partly because I wanted to escape all that morality. At 18 I ran away to
  Las Vegas with a boyfriend I had known for five months. I had no money for a
  dress, so I wore jeans and hiking boots. By the time I turned 34, I had been
  married three times and divorced twice. I lived in a little town in the
  foothills of Yosemite, and at one point, all three of my husbands lived within
  a 10-mile radius. It was an unconventional little community, and we were
  hippies – but, even in that relaxed environment, I felt ashamed of the way I
  had racked up multiple marriages. My relationships with all three husbands
  were meaningful, but I could have simply dated them. I had grown up
  uncomfortable in my skin, so the moment a man said “I want to marry you” it
  felt like the ultimate expression of the love I was craving. Perhaps
  initially, I kept getting remarried because there was a part of me that wanted
  to appease my parents. They sent me money for my first divorce, because they
  were so horrified by the news that I was living with a new boyfriend while
  still married to my first husband. My third wedding was the last my parents
  attended. I didn’t want to deal with their disapproval, so I didn’t bother to
  invite them to the fourth and fifth. By the time my fourth divorce came
  through, I was 45 and I had become a professor. I’d put myself through college
  in my 30s waiting tables. I drifted apart from my fourth husband because I had
  begun to grow out of the insecure girl I had been. All my marriages ended
  because I underwent some kind of personal change, or we outgrew each other.
  Sometimes I berate myself for what I did. In hindsight, I was like a little
  tornado going through these men’s lives. But I’m also glad that I didn’t force
  myself to stay still. I really didn’t think I would get married for a fifth
  time. I was teaching, living alone in a beautiful little apartment in Tahoe,
  and I was happy. But then I met Gary in a bar and I was smitten. I remember
  the first time he told me he loved me, I just said, “You can’t! You can’t!” I
  was trying so hard to be rational, for once in my life. My friends and family
  thought I was heading for another mistake. But Gary and I have been together
  for 10 years now, so they have to accept it’s working out. In fact, we
  probably wouldn’t have married at all were it not for the fact that Gary
  needed to use my medical insurance for a knee operation. I have always felt
  secure with Gary, so I wasn’t desperate for the affirmation of marriage with
  him. We moved in together after one week, though – so I wasn’t very practical
  and rational about that. Gary, 68 (married three times) At first, Jan kept her
  four previous marriages a secret from me. She was terrified I’d see it as a
  huge red flag, but it didn’t bother me. I was 60 and I had two ex-wives
  myself. By the time she let it slip, I was already completely enamoured. I’d
  met this beautiful woman and we were having all these adventures together. I
  wasn’t going to let being No 5 change my feelings. Jan really hates it when I
  call myself No 5. She says it makes her feel like Henry VIII. But having
  multiple marriages sounds worse than it really is: I’ve been married three
  times but I’ve only ever been in three serious relationships. The first lasted
  10 years, the next 15, and now I’m with Jan. Jan’s marriages have all been
  quite long, too. If you put it like that, we’re not so bad at marriage. The
  ceremony itself was very understated. I didn’t feel like saying to everyone I
  know, “Hey! I’m getting married – again!” I could just imagine the eyerolls
  from family members. So Jan and I went to Reno, alone. It was actually lovely,
  because there was a young gay couple ahead of us in line to the courthouse,
  who were marrying for the first time. Those two women were so full of joy. We
  asked them to be our witnesses, so some of their first-timer excitement rubbed
  off on us. We don’t celebrate the day we got married. The anniversary of the
  day we met has more meaning to us. I think if there’s something we’ve learned,
  with eight marriages between us, it’s that a wedding certificate is certainly
  not going to keep you together. It’s the daily interactions that count. I try
  to tell Jan I love her every day. Jan jokes about us marrying for the sake of
  my knees, but she doesn’t like it when I make the same joke. She says she
  wants to feel like I chose her out of all the people in the world. Honestly, I
  did. *** ‘I still don’t believe in marriage’ Bev, 75 (married four times) The
  first time I walked down the aisle, it was a marriage of convenience. I shared
  a flat with a friend who was a foreign national during university, and he was
  in danger of being deported – so I proposed to him. We were married for three
  years but our relationship was entirely platonic. My boyfriend at the time
  actually married my flatmate’s Austrian girlfriend on the same day, to keep
  her in the country. It was a double wedding of convenience. There are two
  photographs of the four of us standing outside the register office together.
  At the top of the steps we’re in our “fake” couples, but by the bottom step
  we’ve swapped and I’m holding my boyfriend’s hand. It was an act of rebellion,
  I suppose. I grew up in a conservative Jewish community. My own parents
  couldn’t stand the sight of each other, but they stayed together their entire
  lives for the sake of propriety. I was determined that the institution of
  marriage would be absolutely meaningless to me. I wanted to remain in control,
  and treat marriage like a game. I married my boyfriend a few years later and
  while I did love him, that was for practical reasons, too. It was at a
  register office in Cumbria, and the whole thing was done and dusted in 20
  minutes. I had a child by then, and my parents were so horrified by the idea
  of my having a child out of wedlock I decided that, as it meant nothing to me,
  I might as well placate them. My second husband and I were together for 23
  years, and we had two wonderful children, but things deteriorated. He was
  drinking too much, and we stopped having anything to say to one another. I’d
  grown up in the painful silence of my parents’ unhappiness and wasn’t prepared
  to suffer through it in my own marriage, so I filed for divorce. There was
  another problem in my second marriage: I was falling in love with Mike, one of
  our closest friends. Mike and I would spend Christmases together with our
  families, and there was always something unspoken between us. I remember one
  night, New Year’s Eve 1988, when we were alone together in the kitchen. Mike
  lifted me into his arms to wish me a happy new year. He’s a very tall man, so
  there’s a solid foot between us. As he set me gently back on the ground, he
  whispered in my ear, “When we’re 90, we’re going to have a passionate affair.”
  I remember thinking: do we have to wait until we are 90? But Mike was one of
  those men who believed in the whole “till death do us part” thing. Single for
  the first time in my life, at 43, I discovered that I wasn’t a person who can
  enjoy living alone. I find this hard to admit, because I hadn’t wanted
  relationships to define my life. The man I really loved – Mike – wasn’t
  available. So I got married for a third time, on my 50th birthday. That was
  the closest I ever came to a traditional wedding: there was a cake, and I wore
  a dress, and I even invited my family. I invited Mike, too, but he sent a
  bunch of flowers and an excuse about a “work commitment”. I did have deep
  feelings for my third husband, but we were always doomed to fail. One evening,
  I met up with Mike, and he told me his wife was leaving him. We spent the
  night together, and from that moment on we were an item. Twenty-one years
  later, it is still vibrant and intuitive between us. I married Mike on the
  beach in Tobago when I was 56. It was a romantic day, but I only really did it
  for practical reasons. This time it was to placate our accountant, because we
  would get tax breaks as a married couple. It sounds absurd to say I’ve been
  married four times but still don’t believe in marriage. It does, however, make
  sense in my mind: if someone tells me I can save money and pay less tax by
  getting a marriage certificate, I just ask them where I should sign. Mike, 70
  (married twice) I met Bev for the first time when I was a very shy 17-year-old
  and she was a glamorous older woman of 22. Bev was an exotic creature in
  County Durham, and every inch the hippy. I never imagined I would have a
  chance with her – not least because she was spoken for. I was more at ease
  around Bev when I got a girlfriend, and grew up a bit. We became close
  friends, and our children grew up together. We became family, in a way. But I
  never stopped having an inconvenient crush on her. My first marriage wasn’t
  perfect, but I was determined to make it work for the sake of our children.
  Politically I didn’t really see the point of marriage, but on a more emotional
  level the vows did mean a lot to me. I hadn’t been happy with my wife for
  several years, but I couldn’t bear the idea of upsetting the kids’ childhoods
  by pulling my family apart. My relationship with Bev had always been
  flirtatious, but even when I was feeling at my most romantic I didn’t dare
  hope it could be serious. When I got the invitation to Bev’s third wedding, I
  felt very sad and I sent my regrets. In the end, my wife left me. When I look
  back, I realise that prioritising trying to keep my family intact was
  misguided. I went through a disastrous divorce, anyway, and I don’t think I
  made anyone in my family happier. I wish I’d just declared my love for Bev 20
  years earlier. When we finally got together, it was romantic, but in equal
  parts terrifying. There had been 30 years of buildup to our first kiss. We
  decided to keep kissing, over and over again, until it stopped feeling so
  terrifying and started feeling wonderful. You can’t always get what you want
  without hurting people. I wish I’d spent less of my life afraid of that hurt.
  *** ‘I never felt the overwhelming love I had seen in films’ Yasmin (married
  four times) I grew up in a very strict Muslim culture, but I lived in a
  western country and came of age in the 90s. I spent my teens watching Pretty
  Woman, Notting Hill and Sleepless in Seattle on repeat, so I was completely
  sheltered, and I knew nothing about boys. But I also longed to fall in love
  and live out my own movie. Islam plus chick flicks makes for an odd but
  powerful combination. I think that is partly to blame for the fact that I have
  been married and divorced four times. In my culture, it is impossible to
  “date”. Boyfriends simply do not exist. There are only fathers, brothers and
  husbands. I got married for the first time at 23, after being proposed to by a
  boy who had never kissed me. But, being intensely romantic, I convinced myself
  I was in love with him. Shortly after our wedding day, things became strained
  between us, because when I was alone with him I withdrew into myself. I didn’t
  realise at the time, but I was experiencing depression. My first husband was a
  trustworthy and gentle man, but we were both essentially children. He had no
  idea how to cope with this stranger in his home who was suddenly his wife. One
  year after our wedding day, he asked for a divorce. In Muslim culture, divorce
  is not taboo. The Qur’an treats it as something that isn’t ideal, but is
  nevertheless permitted. Still in the fog of depression, I became engaged again
  – just eight months after being legally separated – to a man I met through my
  Islamic studies group. The leader of the group told me that remaining
  unmarried would cut me off from God, and that as a darker-skinned woman I
  would be lucky to find another husband, so I said yes to the first man who
  asked. He was already married, so I was engaged to be his second wife – in
  some sects of Islam it is usual to have multiple wives. But his first wife
  objected to our marriage, and he became so overcome by guilt during our
  wedding that he packed up all of his belongings immediately after the ceremony
  and left. I spent the night at my grandmother’s home, frozen and mute, and so
  shocked I was almost unable to process what had happened to me. We never
  consummated the marriage. I moved back in full-time with my grandmother and
  tried to start my life again. Despite my continuing struggles with my mental
  health, I was able to build a career. From an outsider’s perspective, I was a
  successful and independent person, but I had so little confidence. I had this
  movie vision of romantic love as a transformative force. I met my third
  husband through the mosque. Again, I married him without ever having been
  alone with him. That ended up being my longest marriage; we had children
  together and a solid, nurturing relationship. But I never felt the
  overwhelming love I had seen in films. After nine years together, I filed for
  my third divorce. My husband was becoming increasingly controlling, so it was
  the right decision. At 40 I got my first-ever boyfriend. We went on dates, and
  spent time alone, although we stopped short of having sex out of wedlock. He
  was highly creative in a way that made him different from any other man I had
  known. I promised my family that I wouldn’t rush into marrying him. My parents
  hadn’t even attended my second wedding because they disapproved of the way I
  was jumping from husband to husband. But when my boyfriend proposed after
  three months I found the prospect of one more shot at the Hollywood ending too
  hard to resist. Of course, he didn’t turn out to be the man I had built him up
  to be, either. We divorced after only six months together. I’ve kept that last
  marriage a secret from work, because it just feels like a blip. I’ve been
  alone for the last five years. For the most part I’ve lost that longing to
  find life-changing love, although I sometimes miss the impulsivity of my
  younger years. My life is more boring now, but I’m also a lot happier. I’m
  going to try my very best to resist getting married again. • Yasmin is a

Forty-two per cent of the married couples you know are destined to divorce, according to the latest UK statistics, but we still buy into the idea that a wedding is a happy ending. The story we like to tell, culturally, about romantic love is straightforward: that there is just one person out there for everyone, and that, once you have found that person, you will be happy every day until one of you is dead. So what about people who rack up multiple marriages? The famous stories tend to have a whiff of madness and glamour about them. There is Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times (twice to Richard Burton). The other, bloodier, example that springs to mind is Henry VIII. To be married and divorced multiple times requires a strange mixture of romanticism and practicality about love. Saying “until death do us part” again, with four ex-husbands still living, suggests that you believe the right marriage might save you. But also that deep down you know it won’t. I started looking for stories of serial spouses in the aftermath of a breakup with a man I had wanted to marry, and there was a part of me that hoped that speaking to these people might loosen the hold that marriage has over my own imagination. Why do so many of us aspire to an institution with a 58% success rate, at best? And why do I feel like a failure because I haven’t achieved it? Serial brides and grooms might find the idea of marriage especially seductive – but I suspected that they might also be clear-eyed about love, and its limits, in a way that most of us are not. The dream of the perfect wedding, and the perfect marriage, can be particularly hard to resist if you are a woman. At first I was surprised to find so many serial brides on internet message boards. I had a stereotype in my head of the man who cycles through women, trading in each new wife for a younger model. But when I actually connected with interviewees, it began to make sense to me. Anita, who has been married six times, told me that she walked down the aisle for the first time at 18 because she was frightened people would think there was something wrong with her if she wasn’t chosen by a man. When her first marriage broke down, Anita kept getting remarried, because to be a divorced woman in the European town in which she grew up was to be a kind of social outcast. A 2019 book by the behavioural scientist Paul Dolan drew on data suggesting that women who don’t marry or have children are happier and healthier than those who do, but there is still a perception that single women are broken or unfulfilled. For men, a solid relationship is one of a number of ingredients that make for a good life, but many of the women I interviewed for this piece were raised – like me – to view marriage as their crowning achievement. Marriage is seductive for irrational, emotional reasons – but it is also incentivised by the state. In the UK, married couples are eligible for tax breaks and, in the US, married couples are allowed to use their spouse’s medical insurance, so a marriage certificate can mean access to life-saving medical care. Carys, a 73-year-old American divorce attorney who has herself been divorced seven times, was transparent with me about the fact that marriage, for her, is partly a financial proposition. When she first got married, in 1972, marriage put women at a disadvantage: marital rape was still legal in most US states, and women generally lost any claim to shared property in the event of a divorce. Speaking to me via video link from her home office, Carys explained that she kept remarrying because she wanted to prove to herself that she had value, and that she could find love but she was also insistent that a marriage should be about something more tangible than romance. “If you’re a divorce lawyer you’re not really so into the ‘until death do us part’ bit of marriage,” she explained. “It’s more something you do to make yourself financially and emotionally safe in the event that things go south.” Carys has filed six out of seven of her own divorces, and used to keep the paperwork sitting in a file on her desk until needed, like a kind of security blanket. “As an attorney who’d handled divorces for hundreds of other people, I always felt able to quickly and painlessly escape.” Carys is happily married to husband number eight. She spoke to me anonymously, and doesn’t always disclose her marital history to clients. Similarly, Anita, who lives in Scotland, keeps her multiple divorces a secret – Anita is not her real name. Other than her sixth husband, the only person who knows the full story of her past is her priest. Even the people who did agree to be photographed in these pages expressed anxiety about being judged. Serial brides and grooms are cast as unstable and morally weak, which is strange – because the people I spoke to struck me as being unusually courageous. Many of us grit our teeth and struggle on through a bad relationship, or numb ourselves to our own unhappiness, because we are afraid of being alone. People who marry multiple times aren’t willing to remain in a bad relationship for the sake of propriety. They seem less afraid to change and to admit defeat than the rest of us are. The serial spouses I interviewed also seemed unusually hopeful. Recovering from any breakup requires a certain amount of resilience. You put yourself back together and try to believe in love all over again. But buying a wedding dress, sending out invitations and saying “I do” in front of everyone you know – for the fifth or sixth time – requires an extraordinary amount of hope. Many of the people who share their experiences below are currently happily married – so what follows is really a series of offbeat, non‑traditional love stories. They are a testament to the value of the pursuit of love, rather than its attainment – and a reminder that a wedding is never really a happy ending. It’s only a beginning. *** ‘My sixth and cheapest wedding was happier than all the others put together’ Lacey, 39 (married six times) Fairytale weddings do not always make for good marriages. I’ve been married six times and that is one thing I have had to learn the hard way. I’ve done his’n’hers matching wedding outfits. I’ve done exotic-location weddings. I’ve done the big-white-dress wedding, three times. Sometimes I think I actually used the wedding planning as a way of escaping from the fact that I was marrying the wrong person. The first time I got married I was only 18, and I wore the same white dress I’d put on six weeks earlier for my high-school graduation. I knew even on our wedding day that I didn’t truly love my husband. I’m almost certain he knew he didn’t truly love me. But I was thrilled by the idea of having a husband and being someone’s wife. I have never been religious, but I had this ingrained idea that the marriage ceremony would magically bind us together. I had spent my childhood feeling lonely, and I was frightened of remaining alone. Of course, it didn’t work out like I’d dreamed. Husband No 1 cheated on me, which I truly don’t blame him for – considering he was 20 years old and we were both clueless kids. My mother went to high school with a top divorce attorney, so I ended up getting a payout. That attorney taught me a lesson that stood me in good stead for all my subsequent divorces: the partner who files for divorce first wins the case. It means you have your ducks in a row and you’ve snapped up the best attorney. That sounds a little heartless, but you can’t get around the fact that, in America, marriage is unavoidably about money. By my 27th birthday, I had been married and divorced three times and I was engaged again. My fourth husband’s family paid for that wedding, which was my biggest yet. It was on a yacht and it cost $40,000. I was wearing a gorgeous corset-backed dress with a mermaid skirt, but I remember feeling sick because I knew that even though my husband and I looked picture-perfect we were already falling apart. It had become clear that I didn’t really know him, and he was growing colder and more withdrawn, but I felt like I had to go through with the marriage because the invitations had been sent out, and people were sending me gifts. I filed for divorce after only a year. By the time I was organising my fifth wedding my parents were getting tired of my constant marriages. They just said, “OK, you’re getting married again. We’re not going to come to this one.” That marriage still wasn’t a success, but at least the wedding day was more low‑key. It was a courthouse ceremony, with only his parents in attendance. I was pregnant, which was the only reason I went through with it. I had grown up over the course of my previous four marriages. I no longer had any faith that the ceremony was going to transform us into a perfect couple – but I wanted to at least give our kid a chance at a traditional mother-father setup. That marriage lasted less than a year. At 29, I started dating again, but I decided it was time to be brutally honest. I wrote on my dating profile that any boyfriend would have to come second to my daughter, and that I didn’t have much time to spare. I matched with Jonathan, and I remember promising myself that I wasn’t going to put on any kind of front. I think I told him I’d been married five times previously over text, before we even met in person. He reacted with such openness. He had this beautiful, soft expression in his teddy bear-brown eyes, and he listened. Jonathan was so curious about me – which felt amazing, because I’d shown him something true. I married Jonathan one and a half years after our first date, and we both wore jeans and T-shirts. The whole thing cost $120. We bought our rings from Amazon for $20, paid the magistrate $40, and filed the paperwork for $60. It was my sixth and cheapest wedding, and happier than all the others put together. I used to dread the everydayness of being in a couple: the bills and laundry. But even bills and laundry can be kind of wonderful, when you’re with the right person. It just took me six attempts to find him. Jonathan, 44 (married twice) The first thing that struck me about Lacey is that she wears her heart on her sleeve. When she told me she had five marriages behind her, I was a little taken aback, but I was more disarmed by her ability to just say something like that to a stranger. She seemed courageous, but also had a vulnerability to her. She had no wall up whatsoever, and she wasn’t interested in playing games. I used to find it difficult to tell the truth all the time, about every little thing that goes through my head, but Lacey makes it feel possible because she started us off that way. I had been married once before, when I was 21. It was a very beautiful, elaborate wedding in an imposing building in Virginia, in the middle of these immaculate grounds, but even when I think about that day now I feel anxious. The richness felt superficial to me. My ex-wife and I were always more like roommates than real lovers. I wanted to escape from my home town, and so did she, and we were marrying to give us both a kind of alibi to present to our respective parents. My ex and I had a Catholic ceremony, and there was a moment in the middle where we both had to light a candle. I tried to light mine about five times but it wouldn’t work. I remember thinking: it’s a sign! When I married Lacey, at 36, there was no fuss. She didn’t even wear a dress. My T-shirt said “I’m her Jack” and hers said “I’m his Sally”, because we’re both massive Nightmare Before Christmas fans. Standing in front of the justice of the peace in T-shirts felt so much more meaningful to me than all the fanfare of my previous wedding, because what we had together was real. I didn’t feel nervous at all. I had this amazing sense of calm. Lacey may have been married five times before she met me, but all five of her marriages add up to about 11 years in total, which is roughly the same length of time as my first marriage. So to my mind we’re even. Sometimes I think about how easy it would have been for Lacey and I to have never met, and it frightens me. We grew up in different states, and if we hadn’t happened to have logged into the same dating site at the same time, I never would have known that she existed. If anything, I feel strangely grateful for her five previous marriages, because they led her to me. *** ‘She is slow and steady with her love, whereas I am an incurable romantic’ Joseph, 85 (married five times) My friends used to crack jokes about the fact that I was the man who couldn’t stop getting married. I’ve been divorced four times, and there was a perception that there must be something very wrong with me, to have failed to make so many marriages work. I don’t think the comments were entirely fair. There were undoubtedly things wrong with me, but I was a work in progress. I’ve been happily married to my fifth wife, Emily, for decades, and, while I attribute the success of our marriage to the fact that Emily and I are such a good fit, I also think I have age to thank for it. I met Emily when I was 55 and I knew myself in a way you simply can’t at 25. I was 29 when I left my first wife. During our five‑year marriage our life looked like a 1950s vision of the American dream. The problem was that it wasn’t 1950, it was 1968, and the culture was changing. I was working as a cab driver in San Francisco, and I was fascinated by the hippies I saw out on the streets. People were protesting over the brutality of Vietnam, and reeling from the death of Martin Luther King. I didn’t want to live my traditional American life any more. So I became a hippy and joined the movement. My first wife was deeply shocked by the way I wanted to live. We argued about it intensely. Looking back, I see the way I handled that divorce as one of my failures. I wish I had been kinder, but I wanted so badly to remake my life. My second marriage was the polar opposite of my first. My wife and I lived with 40 other hippies in a house with no running water. Politically we were opposed to marriage, and we only went through with it for financial reasons. The marriage lasted for five years, and there were many wonderful things about it – but ultimately we fell apart. Drugs were a part of our lifestyle, and they intensified a propensity I had within me from childhood to feel hard done by. My second wife left me because she couldn’t cope with my anger, and I don’t blame her. I stopped experimenting with drugs, and distanced myself from the hippy lifestyle – but I was in a state of mourning for my second marriage for many years. When I started dating again, my goal was to remarry. Even though I had tried to reject the 1950s values instilled in me by my parents, it was deeply ingrained in me that marriage was the right way to do a long‑term relationship. So I tried again, twice more, between the ages of 43 and 50. My fourth wedding was a big hoopla because my wife-to-be wanted a huge shindig. I think my family’s misgivings about my ability to make a relationship work really peaked when that marriage failed. I met Emily when I was 55, and I asked her to marry me several times in our first years together. She always said no. She is slow and steady with her love, whereas I am an incurable romantic. Finally, out of the blue one day, Emily said she would marry me – and I couldn’t set the date fast enough. Emily and I don’t try to change one another, and I think that is because we met as middle-aged people, rather than as inexperienced 20-year-olds. We celebrate our 30th anniversary next year, so my friends certainly aren’t laughing at me any more. Emily, 76 (married once) I was 46 when I met Joseph, and I had never been married, because to my mind a wedding wasn’t something to aspire to. My mother always told me that if she could do it all over again, she would have remained single. My father was an upright man, but marriage had transformed her life into endless drudgery. I also came of age in the 1970s feminist movement, so it didn’t seem safe to me to emotionally involve myself with a man, and lose myself in a relationship. I had deep relationships in my 20s and 30s, but I also enjoyed the excitement of the sexual revolution. We had the pill. We felt so wonderfully free. But, around the time I met Joseph, I was looking for something more long-term and stable. So I put a little ad in my local paper, seeking a man who was “kind”, “gainfully employed” and “under 6ft tall” – because I didn’t want to have to stretch too much to kiss him. Joseph sent me a letter via the newspaper, and I remember liking his writing style. He also was – and still is – very good-looking. I found out later that Joseph had Xeroxed that very same letter and sent it out to a number of different women who had posted newspaper ads, but by that time he had won me over. It was surprising to me that Joseph had been married four times previously. I would have been less shocked if he had had 1,000 ex-lovers, because exploration of that nature was more familiar to me. The ex-wives seemed weirder, in a way, because they suggested that he believed in marriage – which I did not. But as I heard the full story of every marriage, Joseph’s history began to make more sense to me. He is intensely romantic, whereas I would describe myself as a “careful romantic”. I want to make sure everything is safe before I throw myself in. After a few years I thought: why not? I was convinced by that time that I would be spending my life with him, and I knew it would make him happy. We are deeply affectionate with one another, and cuddle and kiss all the time, even after 29 years together. But, still, falling in love wasn’t a mad, emotional rush for me. I was practical and thoughtful about it. Joseph’s romanticism is offset by my clear-headedness, and it works. We balance one another out. *** ‘All my marriages ended because I underwent some kind of personal change’ Jan, 70 (married five times) I ended up getting married five times, a fact that was so shocking to my mother that she simply never mentioned it. My parents never had much money, but they were proud of their morals. I got married for the first time partly because I wanted to escape all that morality. At 18 I ran away to Las Vegas with a boyfriend I had known for five months. I had no money for a dress, so I wore jeans and hiking boots. By the time I turned 34, I had been married three times and divorced twice. I lived in a little town in the foothills of Yosemite, and at one point, all three of my husbands lived within a 10-mile radius. It was an unconventional little community, and we were hippies – but, even in that relaxed environment, I felt ashamed of the way I had racked up multiple marriages. My relationships with all three husbands were meaningful, but I could have simply dated them. I had grown up uncomfortable in my skin, so the moment a man said “I want to marry you” it felt like the ultimate expression of the love I was craving. Perhaps initially, I kept getting remarried because there was a part of me that wanted to appease my parents. They sent me money for my first divorce, because they were so horrified by the news that I was living with a new boyfriend while still married to my first husband. My third wedding was the last my parents attended. I didn’t want to deal with their disapproval, so I didn’t bother to invite them to the fourth and fifth. By the time my fourth divorce came through, I was 45 and I had become a professor. I’d put myself through college in my 30s waiting tables. I drifted apart from my fourth husband because I had begun to grow out of the insecure girl I had been. All my marriages ended because I underwent some kind of personal change, or we outgrew each other. Sometimes I berate myself for what I did. In hindsight, I was like a little tornado going through these men’s lives. But I’m also glad that I didn’t force myself to stay still. I really didn’t think I would get married for a fifth time. I was teaching, living alone in a beautiful little apartment in Tahoe, and I was happy. But then I met Gary in a bar and I was smitten. I remember the first time he told me he loved me, I just said, “You can’t! You can’t!” I was trying so hard to be rational, for once in my life. My friends and family thought I was heading for another mistake. But Gary and I have been together for 10 years now, so they have to accept it’s working out. In fact, we probably wouldn’t have married at all were it not for the fact that Gary needed to use my medical insurance for a knee operation. I have always felt secure with Gary, so I wasn’t desperate for the affirmation of marriage with him. We moved in together after one week, though – so I wasn’t very practical and rational about that. Gary, 68 (married three times) At first, Jan kept her four previous marriages a secret from me. She was terrified I’d see it as a huge red flag, but it didn’t bother me. I was 60 and I had two ex-wives myself. By the time she let it slip, I was already completely enamoured. I’d met this beautiful woman and we were having all these adventures together. I wasn’t going to let being No 5 change my feelings. Jan really hates it when I call myself No 5. She says it makes her feel like Henry VIII. But having multiple marriages sounds worse than it really is: I’ve been married three times but I’ve only ever been in three serious relationships. The first lasted 10 years, the next 15, and now I’m with Jan. Jan’s marriages have all been quite long, too. If you put it like that, we’re not so bad at marriage. The ceremony itself was very understated. I didn’t feel like saying to everyone I know, “Hey! I’m getting married – again!” I could just imagine the eyerolls from family members. So Jan and I went to Reno, alone. It was actually lovely, because there was a young gay couple ahead of us in line to the courthouse, who were marrying for the first time. Those two women were so full of joy. We asked them to be our witnesses, so some of their first-timer excitement rubbed off on us. We don’t celebrate the day we got married. The anniversary of the day we met has more meaning to us. I think if there’s something we’ve learned, with eight marriages between us, it’s that a wedding certificate is certainly not going to keep you together. It’s the daily interactions that count. I try to tell Jan I love her every day. Jan jokes about us marrying for the sake of my knees, but she doesn’t like it when I make the same joke. She says she wants to feel like I chose her out of all the people in the world. Honestly, I did. *** ‘I still don’t believe in marriage’ Bev, 75 (married four times) The first time I walked down the aisle, it was a marriage of convenience. I shared a flat with a friend who was a foreign national during university, and he was in danger of being deported – so I proposed to him. We were married for three years but our relationship was entirely platonic. My boyfriend at the time actually married my flatmate’s Austrian girlfriend on the same day, to keep her in the country. It was a double wedding of convenience. There are two photographs of the four of us standing outside the register office together. At the top of the steps we’re in our “fake” couples, but by the bottom step we’ve swapped and I’m holding my boyfriend’s hand. It was an act of rebellion, I suppose. I grew up in a conservative Jewish community. My own parents couldn’t stand the sight of each other, but they stayed together their entire lives for the sake of propriety. I was determined that the institution of marriage would be absolutely meaningless to me. I wanted to remain in control, and treat marriage like a game. I married my boyfriend a few years later and while I did love him, that was for practical reasons, too. It was at a register office in Cumbria, and the whole thing was done and dusted in 20 minutes. I had a child by then, and my parents were so horrified by the idea of my having a child out of wedlock I decided that, as it meant nothing to me, I might as well placate them. My second husband and I were together for 23 years, and we had two wonderful children, but things deteriorated. He was drinking too much, and we stopped having anything to say to one another. I’d grown up in the painful silence of my parents’ unhappiness and wasn’t prepared to suffer through it in my own marriage, so I filed for divorce. There was another problem in my second marriage: I was falling in love with Mike, one of our closest friends. Mike and I would spend Christmases together with our families, and there was always something unspoken between us. I remember one night, New Year’s Eve 1988, when we were alone together in the kitchen. Mike lifted me into his arms to wish me a happy new year. He’s a very tall man, so there’s a solid foot between us. As he set me gently back on the ground, he whispered in my ear, “When we’re 90, we’re going to have a passionate affair.” I remember thinking: do we have to wait until we are 90? But Mike was one of those men who believed in the whole “till death do us part” thing. Single for the first time in my life, at 43, I discovered that I wasn’t a person who can enjoy living alone. I find this hard to admit, because I hadn’t wanted relationships to define my life. The man I really loved – Mike – wasn’t available. So I got married for a third time, on my 50th birthday. That was the closest I ever came to a traditional wedding: there was a cake, and I wore a dress, and I even invited my family. I invited Mike, too, but he sent a bunch of flowers and an excuse about a “work commitment”. I did have deep feelings for my third husband, but we were always doomed to fail. One evening, I met up with Mike, and he told me his wife was leaving him. We spent the night together, and from that moment on we were an item. Twenty-one years later, it is still vibrant and intuitive between us. I married Mike on the beach in Tobago when I was 56. It was a romantic day, but I only really did it for practical reasons. This time it was to placate our accountant, because we would get tax breaks as a married couple. It sounds absurd to say I’ve been married four times but still don’t believe in marriage. It does, however, make sense in my mind: if someone tells me I can save money and pay less tax by getting a marriage certificate, I just ask them where I should sign. Mike, 70 (married twice) I met Bev for the first time when I was a very shy 17-year-old and she was a glamorous older woman of 22. Bev was an exotic creature in County Durham, and every inch the hippy. I never imagined I would have a chance with her – not least because she was spoken for. I was more at ease around Bev when I got a girlfriend, and grew up a bit. We became close friends, and our children grew up together. We became family, in a way. But I never stopped having an inconvenient crush on her. My first marriage wasn’t perfect, but I was determined to make it work for the sake of our children. Politically I didn’t really see the point of marriage, but on a more emotional level the vows did mean a lot to me. I hadn’t been happy with my wife for several years, but I couldn’t bear the idea of upsetting the kids’ childhoods by pulling my family apart. My relationship with Bev had always been flirtatious, but even when I was feeling at my most romantic I didn’t dare hope it could be serious. When I got the invitation to Bev’s third wedding, I felt very sad and I sent my regrets. In the end, my wife left me. When I look back, I realise that prioritising trying to keep my family intact was misguided. I went through a disastrous divorce, anyway, and I don’t think I made anyone in my family happier. I wish I’d just declared my love for Bev 20 years earlier. When we finally got together, it was romantic, but in equal parts terrifying. There had been 30 years of buildup to our first kiss. We decided to keep kissing, over and over again, until it stopped feeling so terrifying and started feeling wonderful. You can’t always get what you want without hurting people. I wish I’d spent less of my life afraid of that hurt. *** ‘I never felt the overwhelming love I had seen in films’ Yasmin (married four times) I grew up in a very strict Muslim culture, but I lived in a western country and came of age in the 90s. I spent my teens watching Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Sleepless in Seattle on repeat, so I was completely sheltered, and I knew nothing about boys. But I also longed to fall in love and live out my own movie. Islam plus chick flicks makes for an odd but powerful combination. I think that is partly to blame for the fact that I have been married and divorced four times. In my culture, it is impossible to “date”. Boyfriends simply do not exist. There are only fathers, brothers and husbands. I got married for the first time at 23, after being proposed to by a boy who had never kissed me. But, being intensely romantic, I convinced myself I was in love with him. Shortly after our wedding day, things became strained between us, because when I was alone with him I withdrew into myself. I didn’t realise at the time, but I was experiencing depression. My first husband was a trustworthy and gentle man, but we were both essentially children. He had no idea how to cope with this stranger in his home who was suddenly his wife. One year after our wedding day, he asked for a divorce. In Muslim culture, divorce is not taboo. The Qur’an treats it as something that isn’t ideal, but is nevertheless permitted. Still in the fog of depression, I became engaged again – just eight months after being legally separated – to a man I met through my Islamic studies group. The leader of the group told me that remaining unmarried would cut me off from God, and that as a darker-skinned woman I would be lucky to find another husband, so I said yes to the first man who asked. He was already married, so I was engaged to be his second wife – in some sects of Islam it is usual to have multiple wives. But his first wife objected to our marriage, and he became so overcome by guilt during our wedding that he packed up all of his belongings immediately after the ceremony and left. I spent the night at my grandmother’s home, frozen and mute, and so shocked I was almost unable to process what had happened to me. We never consummated the marriage. I moved back in full-time with my grandmother and tried to start my life again. Despite my continuing struggles with my mental health, I was able to build a career. From an outsider’s perspective, I was a successful and independent person, but I had so little confidence. I had this movie vision of romantic love as a transformative force. I met my third husband through the mosque. Again, I married him without ever having been alone with him. That ended up being my longest marriage; we had children together and a solid, nurturing relationship. But I never felt the overwhelming love I had seen in films. After nine years together, I filed for my third divorce. My husband was becoming increasingly controlling, so it was the right decision. At 40 I got my first-ever boyfriend. We went on dates, and spent time alone, although we stopped short of having sex out of wedlock. He was highly creative in a way that made him different from any other man I had known. I promised my family that I wouldn’t rush into marrying him. My parents hadn’t even attended my second wedding because they disapproved of the way I was jumping from husband to husband. But when my boyfriend proposed after three months I found the prospect of one more shot at the Hollywood ending too hard to resist. Of course, he didn’t turn out to be the man I had built him up to be, either. We divorced after only six months together. I’ve kept that last marriage a secret from work, because it just feels like a blip. I’ve been alone for the last five years. For the most part I’ve lost that longing to find life-changing love, although I sometimes miss the impulsivity of my younger years. My life is more boring now, but I’m also a lot happier. I’m going to try my very best to resist getting married again. • Yasmin is a pseudonym
