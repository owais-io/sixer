  After Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out at the Smithsonian Institution – a
  premier museum, education and research complex for US history and culture –
  over what he called an excessive focus on “how bad Slavery was”, the Guardian
  has revealed the shape his administration’s targeting of seven flagship
  museums will take. Trump suggested he would pressure the institution to accept
  his demands, just like he did with colleges and universities by threatening to
  cut federal funding. The White House said last week it would lead an internal
  review of some Smithsonian museums after Trump earlier this year accused it of
  spreading “anti-American ideology”. Here is the key Trump administration news
  of the day: Exclusive: Trump to review Smithsonian museums to ‘get Woke out’
  Amid the Trump administration’s heavy-handed review of Smithsonian museums,
  the Guardian has seen a document compiled by the White House that argues the
  widely visited cultural institutions have overly negative portrayals of US
  history, from a Benjamin Franklin exhibit that links his scientific
  achievements to his ownership of enslaved people to a film about George
  Floyd’s murder that it says mischaracterizes the police. Read the full story
  President calls on Federal Reserve governor to resign Donald Trump called on a
  Federal Reserve governor to immediately resign, renewing his extraordinary
  attack on the central bank’s independence as officials mull next steps on
  interest rates. The president has repeatedly broken with precedent in recent
  months to demand the Fed cut rates and urged its chair, Jerome Powell, to quit
  after disregarding such calls. Read the full story Texas Republicans pass
  gerrymandered congressional map requested by Trump The Republican-controlled
  Texas House of Representatives has approved a redrawn congressional map
  requested by Donald Trump and fiercely opposed by Democrats, who led a
  weeks-long protest to stall the effort that kicked off a redistricting arms
  race between red and blue states. With the House’s approval, the measure next
  goes to the state Senate, where it is expected to pass, possibly as soon as
  Thursday. Read the full story Judge rejects Trump’s request to unseal Epstein
  transcripts A federal judge in New York who presided over the sex-trafficking
  case against the late financier Jeffrey Epstein has rejected the government’s
  request to unseal grand jury transcripts. Judge Richard Berman’s ruling in
  Manhattan on Wednesday came after the judge presiding over the case against
  British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell also turned down the government’s request.
  Read the full story US health agency workers accuse RFK Jr of fuelling
  violence More than 750 current and former federal health employees on
  Wednesday accused the health and human services (HHS) secretary, Robert F
  Kennedy Jr, of fuelling harassment and violence directed at government
  healthcare staff. Read the full story Military vehicle crashes in DC as red
  states send more troops A military vehicle crashed into a car in Washington DC
  on Wednesday morning, an incident that comes as more than six Republican-led
  states have all pledged to send more national guard troops to the capital.
  Read the full story What else happened today: JD Vance was booed and heckled
  with chants of “Free DC!” during a photo op with national guard troops at
  Union Station in Washington on Wednesday afternoon. A Yosemite national park
  ranger was fired after hanging a pride flag from El Capitan, while some park
  visitors could face prosecution under protest restrictions that have been
  tightened under Donald Trump. Texas cannot require public schools to display
  the Ten Commandments in every classroom, a judge said in a temporary ruling
  against the state’s new requirement. Catching up? Here’s what happened on 19
  August 2025.
