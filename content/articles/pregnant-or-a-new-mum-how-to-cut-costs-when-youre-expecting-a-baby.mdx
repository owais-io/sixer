  Get free NHS prescriptions Pregnant women in England are entitled to free NHS
  prescriptions during pregnancy and for 12 months after giving birth, whether
  they are employed or not. (In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, they are
  free for everyone.) You need a maternity exemption certificate, which you can
  get from a midwife, doctor or health visitor. You are also entitled to free
  dental treatment during pregnancy and for 12 months after giving birth in all
  parts of the UK. You must have a maternity exemption certificate or
  equivalent. This is a digital or paper certificate, and you show it to the
  pharmacist when picking up prescriptions in England, or the dentist at your
  appointment. “When you’re pregnant or have a new baby, there can be extra
  costs that add up quickly. That’s why it’s vital to check you are getting all
  the help you’re entitled to,” says Lilly Aaron, the senior policy manager at
  the Money and Pensions Service. If you have paid for prescriptions while you
  are covered by the certificate, you may be entitled to a refund. Check grants
  and benefits You could be eligible for a one-off payment of £500 under the
  Sure Start Maternity Grant scheme if you live in England, Wales or Northern
  Ireland, you or your partner are on certain benefits and you are expecting
  your first baby. Kate Marsh, the midwifery manager at Tommy’s, the pregnancy
  and baby charity, says it is important to apply within the time limit. “You
  need to claim it within 11 weeks of the baby’s due date or within six months
  after your baby is born, [and] it doesn’t have to be repaid,” she said. She
  adds: “You’re also eligible for the scheme if you have refugee status or
  humanitarian protection, or you’ve left Ukraine or Afghanistan to come to the
  UK because of conflict and upheaval in those countries.” Scotland has a
  similar scheme called the Pregnancy and Baby Payment. “Anyone eligible –
  depending on income and benefit entitlement – will receive £767.50 for their
  first child, and £383.75 for babies born after that,” Marsh says. Forty-eight
  hours after you have registered the birth of your child, you are also entitled
  to claim child benefit. For the eldest child, you will get £26.05 a week. For
  the second, where you will meet the two-child cap, you get £17.25. However,
  you may have to pay the high income child benefit charge if you or your
  partner have an individual income that is over the threshold (more than
  £60,000 for the 2024-25 tax year). Take free vitamins Making sure you get the
  right nutrients is important for your baby’s growth and development. You will
  get most of the vitamins and minerals you need by eating a healthy, varied
  diet, but the NHS also advises you take folic acid, iron and vitamin D
  supplements. Some pregnant women are entitled to free vitamins containing
  folic acid, vitamin C and vitamin D under the Healthy Start scheme. “If you
  live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland and you qualify for the Healthy
  Start scheme, you can get free folic acid and vitamins C and D from 10 weeks
  of pregnancy onwards,” Marsh says. “However, it’s important to take folic acid
  and vitamin D even before conception and early in pregnancy, so if you can’t
  afford to buy them at that stage, ask your GP for help.” Marsh says that in
  Scotland, women are entitled to folic acid and vitamins C and D throughout
  their pregnancy. If you do have to pay for vitamins, you don’t need to buy
  expensive branded products, she adds. “Supermarket or pharmacy own-brand
  vitamin D and folic acid are fine.” You will need to show your NHS Healthy
  Start card when you collect your free vitamins. Your midwife or GP can provide
  information about local and national schemes and help you determine your
  eligibility. Healthy Start vitamins are available to breastfeeding mothers as
  well. Save on maternity clothes As your baby bump grows, you are likely to
  increasingly struggle to fit into all of your old clothes. If you are not keen
  on the idea of forking out on a brand-new maternity wardrobe, a “closet audit”
  to identify your loosest and most flowing pieces is a good start. Another
  great investment is a waistband extender. They usually cost less than £10 and
  mean you can carry on wearing your normal clothes for a bit longer. If you are
  keen to keep your normal wardrobe for as long as possible, you could buy some
  long vest tops, which you can tuck into trousers to stop your belly poking
  out. When you do need some new clothes, asking around or buying secondhand
  will help save money. “Online sites such as Vinted and Facebook Marketplace
  can be really useful if you’re looking for maternity clothes. You can find
  good-value bundles from people who know they won’t be needing them again,”
  Marsh says. Calculate your leave As a mum-to-be, you are entitled to a year of
  statutory maternity leave from your employer, no matter how long you have been
  in your job. However, the rules around statutory maternity pay have some
  stipulations. Your employer has to pay you for up to 39 weeks if you are
  working for it in the 15th week before your baby is due and have worked there
  for at least 26 weeks continuously before that, and you need to earn an
  average of at least £125 a week (before tax). Aaron says that the earliest
  your paid maternity leave can start is the 11th week before your baby is due.
  “If your baby is born early, your leave starts the day after the birth,” Aaron
  says. In terms of statutory maternity pay, you get 90% of your average weekly
  earnings before tax for the first six weeks. For the next 33 weeks, should you
  take them, you will be entitled to £187.18 a week or 90% of your average
  weekly earnings – whichever is lower. If you do not meet the requirements for
  maternity pay, you can apply for maternity allowance as soon as you have been
  pregnant for 26 weeks. If you are employed or have recently stopped working,
  you will get £187.18 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever
  is less) for up to 39 weeks. If you are self-employed, you can get between £27
  and £187.18 a week for up to 39 weeks. You can use the government’s maternity
  entitlement calculator to work it out. Get priority Travelling on public
  transport while pregnant can be a challenge, and if your bump is small or you
  are earlier on in your pregnancy, people may feel awkward asking if you need a
  seat. If you are travelling in London and the south-east, the “baby on board”
  badge lets people know to offer you a seat or help. You can order one online
  on the Transport for London website. Some shops will also let you go to the
  front of the line if you are pregnant and struggling. For instance, women on
  Reddit report that in some Primark stores, you can go to the accessible till
  if you are pregnant or have a double buggy. While stores may not have an
  official policy, it is a good idea to ask staff if you are finding it hard to
  stand in line.
