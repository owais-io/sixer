  New research shows alarming levels of Pfas in the blood of people living or
  working near a US air force base responsible for polluting drinking water with
  high levels of the dangerous “forever chemicals”, a new state regulatory
  report has found. The levels are high enough in those who lived and worked
  near the Cannon air force base in Curry county to raise health concerns –
  about 10 times above the levels of those in the region who did not work in the
  contaminated zone. The pollution stems from a type of Pfas-laden firefighting
  foam the military has used across the nation, and the types of compounds found
  at high levels in participants’ blood were also commonly used in foam. “The
  results put heartbreak into hard facts,” said James Kenney, the New Mexico
  environment department secretary. “This evidence of the harm the US air force
  has done to its neighbors is a call to action to immediately address its
  longstanding, neglected, toxic Pfas plume that continues to expose the
  families of Curry county.” Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most
  frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. The
  chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high
  cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They
  are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the
  environment. Pfas are a common ingredient in firefighting foam, and the
  military is in the process of phasing it out because the highly toxic
  substance has widely contaminated water and the environment around more than
  700 bases nationwide. However, blood levels of nearby residents are not
  regularly monitored. The state of New Mexico is suing the air force to compel
  it to more quickly and thoroughly address its pollution in the region. It has
  poisoned at least 100 private wells, and a public well for Clovis, a nearby
  city of nearly 40,000 people. Levels found in surface water were about 27,000
  times higher than US Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking water limits,
  and polluted water is used on cropland, raising questions about the safety of
  those products. Local dairy farmers in 2018 were forced to euthanize about
  3,500 cows that had contaminated milk. “What happened here in Curry county,
  New Mexico, can happen in any town in USA, so we should all pay attention
  because it’s your water and your family next,” Kenney said. About 99% of 628
  blood samples tested had Pfas, but the four compounds most frequently detected
  were those commonly used in firefighting foam. Though the US government
  estimates about 99% of people have Pfas in their blood, those living and
  working in the plume area showed much higher levels in general. About 26% were
  in the highest tier for Pfas blood levels nationally. People who lived or
  worked in the plume area showed levels of PFHxS, a common Pfas compound used
  in foam, at levels more than three times the estimated US average. The air
  force said it has not reviewed the data, but stressed that it is taking
  multiple steps to address the pollution, including installing a water
  treatment system. The levels in blood are similar to several other areas
  contaminated by firefighting foam, said David Andrews, chief science officer
  with the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which tracks foam and
  military pollution. The levels in blood are cause for concern, he added.
  “Definitely with higher concentrations there’s higher concern for the health
  impacts,” Andrews said. Those with higher levels should talk with their doctor
  and consult the US National Academies guidance on health risks for elevated
  Pfas blood levels, Andrews added.
