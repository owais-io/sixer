  The kindness of strangers: she gave me a pristine white handkerchief to mop up
  the blood on my face

  Years ago I was visiting Naples with my daughter. On our first day there, she
  was itching to go for a walk down to the port, so we dropped our bags at the
  accommodation and set off to explore. I was feeling quite exhausted after the
  flight, and while walking down a steep cobblestone street, I tripped. I flew
  through the air and fell flat on the ground, face first. For some reason, the
  instinct to put my hands out to cushion the fall hadn’t kicked in, so I landed
  straight on my chin. I knew immediately that my jaw was broken – I’d heard the
  awful crack. Before long, blood was gushing down my face. My daughter helped
  me get up and a crowd gathered to help. One of those people was an Italian
  woman, who opened her handbag and took out a pristine white handkerchief with
  a lace trim. She handed it to me and said: “Use this to clean up the blood.” I
  protested, saying I didn’t want to ruin her lovely hanky, but she insisted.
  Before long the ambulance came and I was whisked off to hospital. Her kind act
  was the best thing that happened to me on an otherwise terrible day. I’ve
  learned that bad things happen in life, but, sometimes, good things will come
  from them that take the edge off. This was one of those times. What that
  lovely woman did was so unobtrusive, offered without expectation of anything
  in return. Oddly, it was the futility of her gesture that made it so impactful
  – she was sacrificing something beautiful just to mop up some blood. I never
  saw her again. But I have kept the hanky, washed and white again, as a
  reminder of how to be kind. What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done
