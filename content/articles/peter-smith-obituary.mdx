  My friend Peter Smith, who has died aged 84, was one of Britain’s most
  innovative ceramicists of the modern era. His work blurred the line between
  art and craft. He combined and developed his interest in clay as a sculptural
  material from its origins in domestic pottery. His latter work combined work
  thrown on the potter’s wheel and hand construction. Peter also held a lifelong
  interest in music, particularly jazz. As a drummer he provided the rhythmic
  foundation for traditional jazz bands and in particular for Acker Bilk. His
  love for the music developed from the trad bands of his youth to the abstract
  expressionism of Ornette Coleman. He was indebted to traditional British
  potters – in particular Bernard Leach of the St Ives Pottery. His appreciation
  of the abstract and the expressive allowed him to, in his later work, to
  explore improvised unconventional ceramic forms. Born in Bristol to Ethel (nee
  Sanders), a bank employee, and Norman Smith, who worked for the British
  Aircraft Corporation, Peter attended Bristol Technical school; in 1961 he went
  to Battersea College of Technology (later the University of Surrey) to study
  metallurgy. He started out as a research scientist for the British Iron and
  Steel Association, where he worked for seven years. During his time there he
  was involved in the invention of “foamed steel”, which provides the basis of
  the foamed metals used in heat exchangers today. He also attended pottery
  classes run by Robert and Sheila Fournier at the Chaucer Institute in London
  with his wife, Jane (nee Furlonger), whom he had met at Battersea, where she
  was studying physics; they married in 1966. Six years later they moved to the
  south-west tip of Cornwall, where he was to stay for the rest of his life. He
  started by making a large coal-fired climbing kiln, and produced domestic
  earthenware using traditional methods. Soon afterwards he was voted a full
  member of the Craftsman Potters Association (CPA), of which he was later voted
  a fellow. The Victoria and Albert Museum bought two pieces of work from his
  exhibition at the CPA in London. Peter’s understanding of other artists’ work
  steered him first of all to become a member of Newlyn Society of Artists and
  then later to become the chairman of Newlyn Gallery, in which capacity he
  promoted exhibitions of early work by Damien Hirst, John Bellany and Maggi
  Hambling, among others. In the 1980s and 90s, Peter was also an influential
  teacher of ceramics at Falmouth University, where he encouraged a spontaneous
  and improvised approach based on developing technique and an understanding of
  the medium of clay as an expressive and practical form. He worked continually
  until illness prevented him from doing so in the last few months of his life.
  Latterly he produced more complex, fluid assemblages, emphasising the clay’s
  plasticity with the addition of wire and other initially extraneous material.
  He quietly pursued his voyage of discovery in ceramics for as long as time
  allowed. He is survived by Jane and his siblings, Laurence and Susan.
