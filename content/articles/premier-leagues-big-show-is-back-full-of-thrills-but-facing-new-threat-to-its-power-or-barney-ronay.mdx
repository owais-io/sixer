  And I heard, as it were, a sound of thunder. I heard multitudes marching to
  the big kettle drum. Not to mention, it should be said, even larger multitudes
  talking on the wicked and unholy internet about agent sightings, failed
  here-we-gos and the Alexander Isak wheel of global conspiracy. Let he that
  hath understanding count the number! Because, let’s face it, it really is an
  absolute beast of a number, 215 live Premier League games on Sky Sports alone,
  an endless rolling debauchery of games, of graphics that go whoosh, of
  arguments by the lighted dias. Welcome to the start of the Premier League
  season 2025-26. It is, as ever, a thrilling prospect. The opening round of
  fixtures will play out across this long weekend with the familiar sense of
  unspent energy, shapes, tides, narratives that will reveal themselves only in
  the slog through winter into spring. There are very good reasons why this
  thing has become the world’s dominant pop cultural stage. It works. No matter
  how sated you might have become by the end of the last one, there is always
  renewal and fresh hunger. Albeit with an even stronger sense this time of
  shifting planes, hard lines dissolving, a Premier League that is, for the
  first time in some time, a little menaced by omens, portents and notes of
  horn-parping rapture. Two significant things have happened this summer. First,
  Premier League clubs have spent like the world is on fire. The running total
  on basic transfer fees is more than £2bn with two weeks to go, already the
  second-largest ever, with a shot at beating 2023’s all-time high, post-Covid.
  This has been classic muscle-flexing Big Window Energy. Nine clubs, according
  to Transfermarkt, have ticked up more than £60m on ins minus outs. Manchester
  United and Arsenal are more than £200m. Liverpool, the champions, have spent
  £253m gross in regearing the starting XI, part of a wider trend of genuine
  churn, book-balancing and head-count shift. If this feels a little wild in
  places it is perhaps a reflection of that second element, the feeling of
  rumblings off stage, other powers rising, a war in heaven about to break.
  There are good reasons why Sky has chosen to gorge itself on English football
  this season, recentring on its key asset. This has been the founding
  commercial relationship for both parties, and a relatively simple dynamic. Put
  on the show. Sell the show to people whose business is screwing metal dishes
  to a wall, who can then sell it on to an audience watching a screen from its
  sofa. Defined territories. Easy to defend from outside interference. That
  model has been screwed into place for 35 years now, its coherence a key source
  of the league’s global power. It is already being disrupted. This summer Fifa
  gouged its fingers into domestic football, juicing up its invitees to the Club
  World Cup with vast amounts of Saudi-backed money, skewing the domestic
  balance of income, focus, internal tension. Behold the bald Swiss power broker
  on his great white throne, saying “I will make all things new”. These
  structures, these watertight shapes, are not football’s final form. There are
  signs of the times everywhere, indicators of control being ceded in plain
  sight. The expanded Champions League is already having a similar stratifying
  influence. Regulations feel more mutable and vulnerable to challenge, unless
  you’re Crystal Palace and forgot to play the game. La Liga is playing matches
  overseas. The Premier League is launching a Netflix-style app. A baby has been
  born in Germany speaking only in Thierry Henry memes. That golden ladder is
  reaching down. Flick forward five years. How much longer can the centre hold?
  In the meantime we have more boom times, a fever of commerce. Buy, spend,
  shore up your place in the new heaven and earth. It makes the current season
  feel both oddly reassuring and safe in its August-to-May routines, but also
  hard to read. In recent years there have been three distinct Premier League
  tiers: the lanternes rouges, the back-markers; the well-run middle; and the
  overclass. But even within this who can say who is good right now, who is
  healthy, who has found the right chemistry? Partly this is related to the
  excitable nature of much of the team building this summer. What kind of
  signings are the current wave of US-facing, entertainment product owners most
  likely to go all in for? The answer seems to be whizzy attackers with resale
  value. Florian Wirtz for £116m, Hugo Ekitiké £79m, Benjamin Sesko £73.7m,
  Viktor Gyökeres £63.5m. These are all exciting and unpredictable additions.
  Nobody knows how they will fall, who will fire, which of these variables will
  resolve itself. It still seems safe to say the league title will be divvied up
  between four contenders. Arne Slot has a harder job this season in some ways.
  Ticking over, rejigging, fixing the joins is one thing, and it was expertly
  done. What is required now is now an act of major, high-intensity rebuild on
  the hoof. It is an entirely different kind of test. Nobody knows whether
  Manchester City are back, half-back or non-back. Pep Guardiola talks only in
  prophecies and gospels and sooths these days. Some key expertise has left the
  club. Rodri and Tijjani Reijnders look a very good midfield. There is also
  quite a lot of filler around. Arsenal will be fascinating to watch. Here are a
  team who already have the best defence. Add a new central midfield and a
  goalscorer with the nickname the Cannibal, and there really is nowhere to
  hide. This will not be a personnel issue or a stadium issue or a vibe issue.
  It will be an issue of will and nerve and the bravery to play on the edge, to
  take risks as well as squeeze. Are Chelsea good now? Will they be exhausted or
  energised? They have a thrillingly strong midfield and a fresh cutting edge.
  They really should be title contenders. In the tier below, Newcastle fans have
  finally found something objectionable about their owners, specifically the
  inability to run a successful player recruitment and retention arm. But the
  team are still very strong. Aston Villa can get on with winning the Europa
  League. Manchester United will as ever exist in their own group of one,
  simultaneously epic, moreish, big-time, brittle, rickety and utterly brown
  paper and string. Sesko could be an excellent signing, and has the right elite
  vibes. On one hand there has to be an improvement. On the other the midfield
  is still two bad games from thawing out the cryogenic chamber and having
  another go with Casemiro. In the middle range, AKA Brightfordmouth, the
  challenge is to resist the effects of being cannibalised and rebuild once
  more. Crystal Palace look strong and motivated. Everton could have their best
  season for a while. Fulham have failed to add much but should be fine because
  of Marco Silva + London stadium bonus + just enough good players. Nottingham
  Forest have the Europa League to cope with. A poor start could be a problem.
  Spurs could be anything, or simply Spurs. West Ham’s problem will be patience,
  allowing Graham Potter’s influence to swell slowly like a tuberous root
  vegetable. Burnley and Scott Parker will be a fascinating contrast, a far more
  defensively robust prospect than the Vincent Kompany job pitch project last
  time around, with its doomed brand-building style. Leeds have energy and a
  sense of collectivism at Elland Road, although somehow it is still hard to
  avoid the idea of Daniel Farke ruefully explaining things on Match of the Day.
  Sunderland will Sunderland. Wolves are going to have to do something
  surprising. The end result is a notably rigid hierarchy of clubs, a league
  table that could well simply end up in the exact order listed here. But which
  still seems to be operating in a state of high-end jeopardy just off stage,
  bonds and structures being tested, a sense of some looming rapture yet to
  reveal itself. Take your sickle and reap. Don’t get left behind. Reach up
  towards those new sources of light and heat. Chelsea are world champions. A
  dog with the head of Jamie Carragher has been found wandering the Mendip Hills
  talking about defensive body position. And now the thing that never ends is
  all set to start once again.
