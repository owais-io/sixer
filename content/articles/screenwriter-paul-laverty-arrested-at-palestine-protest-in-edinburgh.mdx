  The award-winning Scottish screenwriter Paul Laverty has been arrested in
  Edinburgh for wearing a T-shirt that allegedly referenced the proscribed
  protest group Palestine Action. Laverty was attending a protest outside St
  Leonard’s police station in the city centre to support Moira McFarlane, a
  member of Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, who was due to be charged
  under section 13 of the Terrorist Act for wearing a T-shirt with the words:
  “Genocide in Palestine, time to take Action”. Police Scotland confirmed that a
  68-year-old man had been arrested under the Terrorism Act for “showing support
  for a proscribed organisation” and inquires were ongoing. Laverty, a long-term
  collaborator of the film-maker and activist Ken Loach, has written screenplays
  for films including Carla’s Song, Sweet Sixteen and I, Daniel Blake. Their
  collaboration on The Wind That Shakes the Barley, about the Irish war of
  independence, won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. There have been hundreds of
  individual and mass arrests of people attending rallies referencing Palestine
  Action across the UK since the ban on the group came into force on 5 July,
  after a high court judge refused to grant the group’s co-founder Huda Ammori
  an injunction suspending it while a judicial review was pending. Yvette
  Cooper, the home secretary, announced the ban days after activists from the
  group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray
  paint. Police in London are braced for further arrests after Defend Our
  Juries, the pressure group leading protests against the ban, called for more
  than 1,000 people to sign up for its next demonstration to be held in London
  on 6 September. Earlier this month, 532 people were arrested at the largest
  demonstration so far relating to Palestine Action since it was proscribed.
  Last week, the former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain said the UK
  government was “digging itself into a hole” over Palestine Action and that
  fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting voting to ban the group. In an
  article for the Guardian, co-written with Labour MP Stella Creasy, the pair
  wrote: “The status quo has come to mean equating peaceful witness with
  terrorism, and isn’t sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn’t a
  problem that threatens our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide
  in our democracy.”
