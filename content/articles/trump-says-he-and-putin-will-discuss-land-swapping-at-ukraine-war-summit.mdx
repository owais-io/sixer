  Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin will discuss “land
  swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a high-stakes summit on the
  Ukraine war. But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement. During a news
  conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with
  Zelenskyy’s insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum
  on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory
  that it has occupied during the war. “I was a little bothered by the fact that
  Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He
  has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a
  land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that
  through Russia and through conversations with everybody.” European diplomats
  have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the
  territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The
  discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has
  alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his
  personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions. Describing
  his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an
  agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for
  both”. “We’re going to change the lines, the battle lines,” he added. Trump,
  increasingly impatient with Putin in recent months, has long said he does not
  see a ceasefire occurring until he meets the Russian leader in person. The
  German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Monday invited Trump to join emergency
  virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands
  grow for the US president to agree red lines before Friday’s summit with
  Putin. Neither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump’s
  meeting with the Russian president. Trump said on Monday that he would seek to
  arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, a proposal that the Russian
  president has rejected so far. “The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and
  Putin, or Zelenskyy and Putin and me. I’ll be there if they need, but I want
  to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said. He said a deal
  may not be possible and that he saw the upcoming summit as a “feel-out
  meeting”, and that he would update Zelenskyy and European leaders if Putin
  proposed a “fair deal”. “I’ll call him after and I may say lots of luck, keep
  fighting, or I may say we can make a deal,” he said. Merz’s office said in a
  statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to
  put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and
  related issues of territorial claims and security”. It is not clear whether or
  not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call. EU foreign ministers were
  meeting in an emergency session to underscore the demand. The UK has also been
  pressing for wider consultations after Trump unilaterally announced last week
  that he was going ahead with his first meeting with Putin since Russia’s
  invasion of Ukraine. European leaders say Russia represents an existential
  threat to the continent and that they should not be excluded from the process.
  Issues such as the terms of a ceasefire, further sanction pressure on Russia,
  any proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine would be
  discussed with the US president in the virtual meeting. There is concern that
  an unpredictable Trump will be lured into making fatal concessions to Putin,
  and the meeting would be a chance for him to map out his strategy. The Polish
  prime minister, Donald Tusk, said he was optimistic that the US president
  would formally consult European leaders before his meeting, and said the
  summit between Trump and Putin filled him with hope and fear. Brussels’ top
  diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “President Trump is right to say that Russia must
  end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia
  to negotiate seriously.” But she added: “Any agreement between the United
  States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security
  issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.” Radosław Sikorski, the Polish
  foreign minister, also asserted Europe’s relevance, saying: “Europe is paying
  for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This
  is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate
  President Trump’s efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in
  Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims.” The White
  House is insisting that the Alaska meeting is to gauge whether Putin is
  willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security
  guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term
  legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy. Merz spoke with Trump on
  Sunday night to underline that he would prefer the US to impose further
  economic sanctions on Moscow before the talks. He also said he assumed
  Zelenskyy would be involved in any talks, but for Moscow it would be a
  concession for a Russian delegation to hold talks with the Ukrainian president
  since its invasion is predicated on not recognising the legitimacy of the
  government. A joint statement on Saturday from the leaders from France,
  Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain, Finland and the European Commission chief,
  Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to put more pressure on Russia and stressed:
  “The path in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Putin will go into
  Friday’s talks believing he is making progress on the battlefield, Trump is
  desperate for a settlement and the Ukrainian people are also increasingly
  willing to make concessions for peace. But the Russian president also knows
  that if he makes no substantive offer, Trump will be under real political
  pressure to go ahead with long-promised broader economic sanctions against
  Russia. Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator behind a congressional plan to
  impose secondary sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, expressed
  confidence that Trump would protect Ukraine’s interests at the summit. He was
  involved in the weekend diplomacy and is trusted as an intermediary with Trump
  by Ukrainian officials. He said if Putin did not offer concessions, he
  expected Trump to make countries importing Russian oil pay a heavy price,
  adding that this applied not just to India but also to China and Brazil. India
  is already due to face 50% tariffs later this month. Speaking on NBC, Graham
  said: “Militarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong
  and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground
  as tripwires to prevent a third [Russian] invasion. We want to end this with
  the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where
  Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed.” He added: “I want
  to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia
  is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end.” Ukraine’s
  leadership has long said that de facto it will not recover all the territory
  it has lost in successive Russian invasions, but with European support it is
  fiercely resisting a Russian demand that it should hand over territory in the
  Donetsk region it has not yet ceded on the battlefield, especially if there
  are no security guarantees for Ukraine or compensating land swaps by Russia.
  Europeans are insisting that no limitations can be imposed on Ukraine
  developing its own military capabilities or the support it receives from third
  countries, including some inside Nato.
