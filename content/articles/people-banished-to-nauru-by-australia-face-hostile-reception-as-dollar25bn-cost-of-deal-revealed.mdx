  The group of noncitizens set to be banished by Australia to Nauru for 30 years
  face a potentially hostile reception because they have been described as
  “violent” and “appalling” by the Australian government. The forcible transfer
  of the so-called NZYQ group – and potentially thousands more under legislation
  currently before parliament – to the tiny island is being quietly resented by
  Nauruans, sources on the island have told Guardian Australia. The NZYQ cohort
  is a group of 354 noncitizens in the Australian community who previously faced
  indefinite immigration detention because their visas had been cancelled on
  “character grounds” but who could not be returned to their home countries
  because they faced persecution, were stateless or because those countries
  refused to accept them. The home affairs department revealed on Wednesday
  evening the just-signed transfer deal, worth $408m upfront to Nauru, as well
  as $70m a year for the life of the agreement, is forecast to cost Australia
  $2.5bn over 30 years. Nauru is a small, familial and tight-knit society. The
  11,000 people there know each other, are related to each other, and in large
  proportion work for the government that is dependent upon Australian aid
  money. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “We wish the government didn’t do this
  to us, but we just have to accept [it],” one island source said, speaking on
  condition of anonymity. There is no independent media on Nauru and overt
  criticism of the government is rare. “People are worried here,” another said.
  “But nobody asks us, or tells us: Where will they live? Will they work here? I
  think it will be very difficult for them, just to go shopping, or to RoN
  [Republic of Nauru] Hospital, because everyone will know who they are,”
  another said. Others have said they are “worried about our Pleasant Island”,
  using the former name for Nauru. Mohammad, an asylum seeker who has been held
  on the island for more than a year, said it was known across Nauru that the
  group was being exiled from Australia because of “character grounds” or
  because of criminal convictions. Some of the NZYQ cohort have significant
  criminal histories, including for violence, but others have never been
  convicted of a crime, or have historical, minor convictions, for non-violent
  offences such as cannabis use. Many have lived in Australia for years, even
  decades, and have Australian citizen children and other family members. When
  the government tried to move the first three of the cohort to Nauru in
  February this year, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, described them as
  “violent offenders” of “appalling character” who should be removed from
  Australia as soon as possible. “Nauru is a very small place. I don’t think
  this will be good for them [the NZYQ cohort] to come, the government has told
  everybody these people are criminals, they are dangerous, they will do some
  wrong things,” Mohammad said. “That is not fair, they have come from a very
  hard situation, very grave situation.” Mohammad said Nauruans had followed the
  announcement of the deal: “One man said to me ‘why is our government taking
  this money and bring[ing] these people to Nauru’. He was shouting, angry.” In
  November 2023, the high court ruled it was unlawful for the government to
  indefinitely detain them if there was “no real prospect” of them being removed
  from the country “in the reasonably foreseeable future”. Earlier this year,
  Nauruan president David Adeang defended the deal, saying those being sent to
  Nauru had been imprisoned but had “served their time”. “Australia is trying to
  send them back to their country but they are not wanted back home. So we
  accepted them.” In a televised address, Adeang said: “the long-term goal
  remains the eventual repatriation of these individuals to their home
  countries, should circumstances allow”. But Nauruans were divided by the
  agreement, some raised concerns about safety and social harmony and others
  decrying their country’s exploitation as a “dumping ground” or “prison island”
  by Australia. “It’ll be alright Australian government will be handing over
  some cash for our leaders to have them over and leaving amongst us [sic],” one
  said online. “Government is so out of touch, turning this country into a
  sanctuary for illegals and criminals, this is more reflecting of them on how
  they see this country [sic],” another commented. Late on Wednesday, the senate
  held a three-hour hearing into the legislation that would allow the NZYQ
  group’s forcible transfer to Nauru on 30-year visas. However, the details of
  the MOU signed between Australia and Nauru have not been made available for
  public or parliamentary scrutiny. Jana Favero, deputy chief executive of the
  Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said Australians should be “outraged” by the
  government seeking to rush the legislation through parliament. “This
  government is planning to pour hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into a
  secretive Nauru deal with no transparency or accountability,” she said. “This
  is the second time the Albanese government has rushed migration legislation
  through parliament with no warning and a rushed, sham hearing with the
  department of home affairs as the only witness … This is secrecy at its worst,
  a recipe for corruption and a disgraceful waste of public funds. We are
  literally paying for cruelty.” Australia holds about 100 asylum seekers and
  refugees on Nauru, its “enduring” offshore processing site. Most have been on
  the island more than a year. “Our situation here is very, very hard,” Mohammad
  said. “People are sick, people are distressed because we don’t know what our
  future will be, what will happen to our lives.”
