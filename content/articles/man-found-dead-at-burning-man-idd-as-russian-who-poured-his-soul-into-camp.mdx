  Law enforcement officials investigating a homicide at the Burning Man festival
  in Nevada have identified the victim, federal authorities announced on
  Wednesday. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which manages the Black Rock
  Desert national conservation area where the festival is held each year, said
  in a statement that the man who was killed on Saturday had been identified as
  Vadim Kruglov of Russia. Officials launched a murder investigation over the
  weekend after a festival attendee found a man “lying in a pool of blood” and
  “obviously deceased” on Saturday, the final night of the event, and alerted
  police. The incident occurred between 8pm and 9.15pm, according to the BLM, as
  the festival was setting fire to a wooden effigy, known as the burning man.
  Police cordoned off the scene as they investigated and interviewed “several
  participants in the immediate area”, said Jerry Allen, the Pershing county
  sheriff. Allen had asked for the festivalgoers’ help in identifying the victim
  and for accounts from people who may have seen anything between 8pm and
  9.30pm. “We are also currently seeking information regarding any suspect
  identifiers for any person who would commit such a heinous crime against
  another human being,” Allen said. “At this time, no information is too small
  to disregard, so do not hesitate to contact my office.” Kruglov, who had
  reportedly been living in Washington, was identified by his fingerprints, the
  sheriff’s office told the Reno Gazette Journal. A friend shared on social
  media that Kruglov had “poured his soul into our community: building the camp,
  creating an art installation, always ready to help others, and being kind and
  responsive to everyone”. “His energy and contribution will forever remain part
  of the Burn’s history,” the post said. The sheriff’s office said the killing
  appeared to be a “singular crime”, but said Burning Man participants should
  always be vigilant. This year’s festival has been beset with unusual events,
  including especially powerful dust storms that destroyed artwork as well as
  the famous “orgy dome”, and a woman, who has said she was not aware she was
  pregnant, giving birth at the festival.
