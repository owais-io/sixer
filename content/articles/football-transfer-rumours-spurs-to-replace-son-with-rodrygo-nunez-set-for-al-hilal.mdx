  There is a sense that the transfer window is entering a period of calm before
  the inevitable storm. The chitter-chatter of agents is at a lull and the same
  old names are being bandied around in the hope someone will finally have a
  nibble. Tottenham’s Son Heung-min is on his way out and therefore a
  replacement needs to be found by Thomas Frank. At this stage of August, it is
  sensible to target someone who is definitely available. Real Madrid’s Rodrygo
  will be allowed to leave the Spanish capital and moving to the British
  equivalent may be a reasonable selling point to the Brazilian, not to mention
  the joys of testing himself in the Premier League rather than sitting on a
  number of La Liga benches. If Liverpool are to get the money together to bring
  in Alexander Isak, it would be quite helpful if they could off-load Darwin
  Núñez. Do not fear, because there is often a Saudi Premier League side willing
  to help out clubs in such a plight and Al-Hilal are open to offering a massive
  wad of cash in exchange for the Uruguayan striker. It is well documented that
  Manchester United and Newcastle want to acquire the lanky services of Benjamin
  Sesko from Leipzig, but the Magpies are busily concocting a plan B, just in
  case the Slovenian fancies keeping his midweeks free. If Sesko heads to Old
  Trafford, Eddie Howe will get on the blower to Paris Saint-Germain as he is
  keen on Gonçalo Ramos. The Portuguese striker has rarely been Luis Enrique’s
  first choice, so could be happy to head to another Champions League team in
  the hope of becoming a star. One former Manchester United forward could be on
  the move in the coming weeks, as Inter have taken an interest in Mason
  Greenwood. The former England international has impressed in Ligue 1 with
  Marseille, and any potential sale would be welcomed at Old Trafford as they
  get a healthy whack of sell-on percentage. Whether Inter push forward with a
  move for Greenwood, might depend on another English-born winger after Ademola
  Lookman handed in a transfer request at Atalanta. The Nigerian international
  has been a target at San Siro for a while and Lookman looks eager to push
  through a move. Chelsea remain keen on the Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons but
  there could be a twist in the tale as the Germans may counter this by bidding
  for Tyrique George. The teenager has shown promise since breaking into the
  first team at Stamford Bridge, but very few people are off limits at Chelsea
  as they just love to do deals. And across London, Arsenal have made an inquiry
  with Rennes over the 20-year-old defender Jérémy Jacquet. The French
  centre-back is deemed to be not for sale by the Ligue 1 side, which might be
  somewhat problematic for the Gunners, but money often talks.
