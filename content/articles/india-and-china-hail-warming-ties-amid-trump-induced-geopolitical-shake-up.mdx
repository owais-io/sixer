  India’s prime minister and China’s foreign minister have hailed “steady”
  progress in their countries’ fractious relationship, agreeing to resume trade
  and other ties, as well as work towards resolving the long-running Himalayan
  border dispute, amid a global geopolitical shake-up instigated by Donald
  Trump’s tariff regime. According to statements from China’s foreign ministry,
  the two sides agreed to resume direct flights – reiterating a pledge made in
  January – as well as issuing visas to journalists and facilitating business
  and cultural exchanges. On social media, India’s prime minister, Narendra
  Modi, noted “respect for each other’s interests and sensitiveness”, while
  China’s foreign ministry said the countries had entered a “steady development
  track” and should “trust and support” each other. The visit by Wang Yi,
  China’s top diplomat, to Delhi came before an expected visit to Beijing by
  Modi to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in October. It will be Modi’s first
  trip to China since 2018. Relations between the two nuclear powers plummeted
  in 2020 when a border dispute in the remote Himalayas turned deadly. Their
  soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the worst episode of violence
  between the neighbours in decades, with an official death toll of 20 Indian
  and four Chinese soldiers. Since then, the two sides have held a series of
  talks to de-escalate the situation. Modi and Xi had their first meeting in
  five years last October in Russia. Both sides have continued to fortify
  borders, but have agreed to a pact on border patrols, and withdrawn additional
  forces. India’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said Wang had met India’s
  foreign affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and national security
  adviser, Ajit Doval, and discussed “de-escalation, delimitation and boundary
  affairs”. Chinese state media phrased the discussion as agreeing to “explore
  the possibility of advancing boundary demarcation negotiations”. “The setbacks
  we experienced in the past few years were not in the interest of the people of
  our two countries. We are heartened to see the stability that is now restored
  in the borders,” Wang said on Monday. India said Jaishankar also raised
  concerns about China’s plans to build a giant dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River
  in Tibetan territory – expected to be the world’s biggest hydropower project –
  which Delhi fears will have an impact on downstream communities and areas. The
  thawing of relations between Delhi and Beijing comes as Donald Trump’s
  unprecedented trade tariffs continue to shake up the global order. India is a
  longstanding Asian ally of the US, particularly in countering the influence of
  China in the region, and is a member of the Quad grouping, which also includes
  Australia and Japan. However, earlier this month Trump announced an additional
  25% tariff on imports from India, in retaliation for its purchase of oil from
  Russia. Set to come into effect on 28 August, it will bring the punitive US
  tariffs on Indian imports to 50%. India described the tariffs as “unfair,
  unjustified and unreasonable” and said it would take all necessary actions to
  protect its interests. On Wednesday, a senior Russian embassy official in
  India, Roman Babushkin, said Russia would keep supplying oil to India through
  a “very special mechanism” and said the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, would
  visit Modi in Delhi by the end of the year. Babushkin also hinted at a revival
  of Russian plans to stage a trilateral meeting with China and India. “We are
  quite hopeful that this format will be resumed sooner rather than later,
  because its importance is not questioned,” Babushkin said. Sana Hashmi, a
  fellow at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation, said the US president’s tariffs
  and the perception of a reduced US presence in Indo-Pacific partnerships had
  contributed to and accelerated efforts to stabilise the India-China
  relationship. But there remained “fundamental differences” between the two.
  “Core security issues and the overall nature of India-China relations will not
  change because of Trump’s policies, and the Indo-Pacific framework will
  continue to shape regional dynamics,” Hashmi told the Guardian. “For now,
  India’s priority lies in managing tensions with China while navigating
  turbulent waters with the US.” After India, Wang will travel to Pakistan, a
  close ally of China but rival of India. During a four-day conflict between
  India and Pakistan in May, Pakistan fought using Chinese-made military
  hardware, including jets. China’s foreign ministry said both India and
  Pakistan were “important neighbours” of China, but described China and
  Pakistan as “ironclad friends and all-weather strategic partners”. “We are
  willing to enhance friendly cooperation with both countries, and hope that
  differences between these two countries can be handled properly,” spokesperson
  Mao Ning said at a regular press conference on Tuesday. With agencies and
