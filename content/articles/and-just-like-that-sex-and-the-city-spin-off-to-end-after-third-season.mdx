  And Just Like That, the Sex and the City spin-off series, is set to end after
  its current season. The news was announced on the official social channels by
  the showrunner Michael Patrick King, who wrote that they held off on telling
  fans to avoid overshadowing the third and final season, which will end with a
  two-part finale. “It’s with great gratitude we thank all the viewers who have
  let these characters into their homes and their hearts over these many years,”
  he said. The follow-up to the award-winning HBO series brought back original
  stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon to reprise their
  roles. New additions have included Nicole Ari Parker and Sarita Choudhury.
  “Carrie Bradshaw has dominated my professional heartbeat for 27 years. I think
  I have loved her most of all,” Parker wrote on Instagram. “I know others have
  loved her just as I have. Been frustrated, condemned and rooted for her. The
  symphony of all those emotions has been the greatest soundtrack and most
  consequential companion.” Davis wrote that she was “profoundly sad” in a post.
  The show had initially proved a hit on HBO’s streaming service Max, bringing
  in record viewers and sign-ups yet it lost steam over time while also failing
  to win over critics and never registering with awards voters. According to
  Samba, ratings for the season three premiere were down 7% from the second
  season and 62% from the first. In a July article for the Hollywood Reporter,
  Lily Ford wrote about the community of “hate-watchers” who now ridicule rather
  than respect the show. Ford wrote that “over the course of three seasons, fans
  have been forced to unlearn everything we thought we knew and loved about Sex
  and the City”. Sex and the City was a groundbreaking look at the dating lives
  of four women in New York City, proving to be one of HBO’s first original
  ratings hits and winning multiple awards including seven Emmys and eight
  Golden Globes. It was followed up by two hit movies but the second received
  negative reviews and a third was ultimately nixed with rumours that Kim
  Cattrall refused to be involved. Cattrall later came back to And Just Like
  That for a one-season cameo. Parker, who was recently a judge for this year’s
  Booker prize, just confirmed that she will be returning for comedy sequel
  Hocus Pocus 3. Showrunner King, who was one of the original writers of Sex and
  the City, will return to HBO with a just announced third season of cult comedy
  series The Comeback starring Lisa Kudrow.
