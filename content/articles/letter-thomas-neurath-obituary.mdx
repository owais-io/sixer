  As the archaeology editor concerned, I can vouch for the fact that Thomas
  Neurath did indeed once hurl a shoe across his Thames &amp; Hudson office in
  my direction (not directly at me, he was later keen to point out): it was no
  myth. But in that episode I wore the guise of an unwelcome union
  representative. By contrast, over many decades, right up to his death, I
  benefited hugely from his passionate engagement in the business of creating
  bestselling, beautifully designed archaeology and ancient history titles,
  written by top scholars. His charm, enthusiasm and imaginative drive were an
  inspiration to me and to so many others. I shall miss him greatly for the rest
  of my days.
