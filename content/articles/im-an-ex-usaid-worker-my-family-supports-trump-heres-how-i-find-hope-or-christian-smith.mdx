  Since my father’s funeral six months ago, I still call my mother almost every
  day. We live worlds apart, geographically and ideologically, but despite me
  being in Europe and she in the US, and despite our religious and political
  differences, we still manage to keep talking. After all, she’s my mom. This
  year has not been easy, having lost my job, my father and what continues to
  feel like my country. I worked for USAID and believed in America’s capacity to
  help solve global problems while helping others in need, but the current
  administration ended such work, calling it wasteful. Two days after that, my
  father passed away, and as our family gathered to mourn, we received news that
  my mother’s cancer had returned and spread to her bones. Such news was
  devastating, but doctors offered hope. Though there was no cure, there was a
  pill available to stem the spread, sometimes even for many years. Even grief
  couldn’t bridge our differences, though. At our family gathering, my mother
  confronted me about USAID, claiming that the agency funded terrorists and
  performed sex changes on children. Such disinformation about our actual health
  and development programs had taken root and was spreading. I know I am not
  alone in a country of families divided by politics. In our case, my mother and
  most of my extended family have embraced a form of Christianity that
  intertwines closely with conservative politics. Some carry Patriot Bible
  editions with an American flag on the cover while others send their kids to
  school in T-shirts emblazoned with silhouettes of rifles. Our information
  environment accelerates these divisions. Last month, my mother forwarded an
  article arguing that people who criticize Israel don’t do so out of concern,
  say, for casualties, but from discomfort with accepting that God is always on
  Israel’s side. I tried to get her to see the humanity with the same principles
  she taught me – to love one another, to care about suffering – but she
  dismissed the suffering as “God keeping his promises”. I was irate and one
  sister had to break it up, and both sisters stayed silent about the point.
  Such clashes about principles are what test our relationship the most. We’ve
  learned boundaries, so when I talk to my mom, it’s generally about her
  treatment, the weather, plans for the day, family memories and family history.
  Like her medical treatment, our relationship requires attention to potential
  flare-ups. Obviously I am still coming to terms with our differences, but she
  is my mom and I love her. I keep calling and she keeps answering. And our
  relationship is improving. The calls were initially to keep her company, but
  they are turning out to be good for me, too, as I am learning better about
  what comprises our love. The conversations also feel symbolic of something
  larger. If I struggle to find common ground with my mom, how can I expect
  others to bridge similar divides? The essential functions of our body politic
  are under threat, and I suspect that, like my mother’s condition, there’s no
  single cure except the daily discipline of care and listening with mindful
  hearts. It is comforting to stay in our like-minded communities where our
  views face no challenge, where we don’t speak or, better, listen to others.
  It’s easy to dismiss those who disagree as uninformed rather than seeking the
  seed of peace, common ground. My mother raised me to be curious about the
  world, to care about people beyond our family, and to seek truth even when
  it’s uncomfortable, lessons that came from the same tradition of faith that
  now seems to divide us. I don’t pretend our calls are always easy or
  successful, but I am learning patience. I’m learning that to maintain the
  relationship requires me to show up consistently, avoid stepping on landmines
  but hold my ground on key principles (like love and peace), and to listen even
  when I am itching to challenge. And through our consistency, we are finding
  moments of genuine connection. Like any living thing, democracy too can fall
  ill. Dire symptoms are everywhere: polarization of people and information
  sources, and the hardening of hearts against complexity. Of course, we need
  appropriate treatment to escape the present gilded age (get money out of
  politics, tax the rich, support independent media, etc) but getting there will
  require the same kind of commitment that my mother’s doctors ask of her.
  Regular attention. Long-term thinking. And the stubborn belief that what we’re
  trying to preserve is worth the effort. My mom’s medication is helping to slow
  her cancer, giving us more time together. I don’t know how much time we have,
  with her illness or with our country, but I know this: both require us to show
  up every day, to resist the urge to give up and to seek success through small
  consistencies. Our conversations continue, one phone call at a time. In a
  world pulling itself apart, maybe that persistence is its own form of hope.
