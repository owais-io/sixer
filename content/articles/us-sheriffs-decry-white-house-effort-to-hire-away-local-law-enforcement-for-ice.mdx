  The White House’s aggressive push to hire federal immigration agents is
  causing friction with local sheriffs – even those who back Donald Trump’s
  deportation agenda. More than a dozen US sheriffs and law enforcement
  associations have complained that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)
  has tried to poach local deputies and officers as Ice rapidly expands. “It is
  unprofessional and unethical,” Grady Judd, the sheriff in Polk county,
  Florida, told the Guardian last month after his deputies received recruitment
  emails from Ice. Ice utilized an email list the sheriff had provided as part
  of his partnership supporting Trump’s deportations; the messages noted
  recruits could receive a $50,000 hiring bonus. “It’s tantamount to us going to
  police departments and putting up a recruiting booth in their lobby,” said
  Judd, a Republican who has authorized his deputies to carry out immigration
  arrests. Judd and other sheriffs have spoken out as the Trump administration
  has launched its massive recruitment effort to hire 10,000 new Ice officers
  and 3,000 border patrol agents, backed by an unprecedented $170bn in funding
  for immigration enforcement activities. The anger from conservative sheriffs,
  generally Trump’s close allies, underscores the challenges the White House is
  facing as it makes deportations and the expansion of Ice a top priority,
  sometimes at the expense of other law enforcement interests. Federal agents
  who would normally handle child abuse, money laundering, fraud and other
  serious crimes have been diverted to immigration enforcement, targeting
  undocumented people with civil violations, Reuters reported in March. Last
  month, the administration moved to temporarily reassign more than 100 FBI
  agents to conduct nighttime patrols in Washington DC, even though FBI officers
  generally have little experience or training in patrolling or immigration. The
  backlash from Judd and other sheriffs in Florida was notable as the state has
  led the nation in 287(g) agreements, which empower local law enforcement
  departments to directly assist Ice. Immigrant rights’ groups have long
  criticized those partnerships as harmful to public safety, as they make
  immigrant communities less likely to report crimes or assist police in
  investigations. Some of the most vocally Trump-supporting sheriffs have
  criticized Ice’s recruitment. Wayne Ivey, the sheriff in Brevard county,
  Florida – who made headlines in June for threatening to hospitalize and “kill”
  anti-Ice protesters – told WESH 2 News last month that Ice’s targeting of
  local deputies was “backhanded” and “frustrated every sheriff”. Judd said his
  department was paying for deputies to be trained as immigration officers,
  allowing them to arrest and jail undocumented people for Ice. That arrangement
  gave Ice access to his deputies’ contact information. “You took government
  documents that we filled out to help you, to recruit our people that we
  trained on our dime to support you. That’s low-rent,” he said. “I’ve never
  seen that before.” Recruitment emails to sheriff’s deputies were signed by
  Madison Sheahan, Ice’s deputy director, who previously served as an aide to
  Kristi Noem, homeland security secretary, when Noem was South Dakota governor,
  ABC News reported. Sheahan, 28, has no prior immigration enforcement
  experience and has alienated career officials within Ice, according to a
  recent Atlantic story delving into internal conflicts at the agency. “As
  someone who is currently supporting Ice through the 287(g) program, you
  understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities
  and upholding federal law,” Sheahan’s recruitment email said. “Ice is actively
  recruiting officers like you.” Judd said Ice representatives in Florida
  weren’t involved in the recruitment and had apologized. He blamed Sheahan,
  saying she and her DC colleagues did not acknowledge the misstep: “They
  doubled down. They didn’t apologize. They didn’t say it was bad form. That
  made me even more angry. It just shows her lack of maturity,” he said. “The
  illustration to me is they’re probably sneaky and underhanded and not
  professional with the way they run the rest of the organization.” Still, Judd
  said, “We’re not going to back down on President Trump’s mission. We’ll
  continue to help Ice, because we are professional, unlike the Ice deputy.” In
  the first five months of the year, Judd’s office detained more than 200
  undocumented people for Ice in the county’s jails, according to the Ledger
  newspaper. The National Sheriffs’ Association, which represents sheriffs
  across the country, also raised concerns about Ice recruitment. The
  association’s executive director said last month it would be hard for local
  departments to compete with the $50,000 bonus and other incentives, which
  could burden agencies already struggling with staffing. Judd, however, said he
  wasn’t concerned about his deputies joining Ice. He said he suspected ongoing
  anti-Ice protests were hampering recruitment: “It’s a very difficult and
  dangerous job … and you’ve got to be comfortable and sure that the community
  supports you. When people see the way that Ice is being unfairly targeted,
  even if they want to be in law enforcement, they don’t want to be in that
  branch.” Scott Shuchart, a former senior Ice official under Biden, who has
  raised concerns about Trump recruitment spree, said it seemed “really
  disrespectful” to poach from sheriffs who have invested their own funding to
  support Ice through 287(g) agreements: “They’re already taking sheriff’s
  deputies who are supposed to be keeping the community safe and instead are
  helping out Ice. To now do the double whammy of stealing those resources to be
  fully Ice’s seems like no way to treat a partner.” On Tuesday, the US
  Department of Homeland Security announced a program to reimburse local law
  enforcement agencies for the salaries of trained 287(g) officers and said
  departments would be “eligible for monetary performance awards based on the
  successful location of illegal aliens”. Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant
  secretary, said in a statement that Ice was recruiting “local law enforcement,
  veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have
  valuable law enforcement experience”. More than $500m from Trump’s major
  budget bill would go toward expanding 287(g) partnerships, she added.
  McLaughlin also said Sheahan, the Ice deputy director, had law enforcement
  experience from her previous job as secretary of the Louisiana department of
  wildlife and fisheries, and had been “instrumental in leading negotiations”
  for more than 900 287(g) agreements: “These attacks on Madison Sheahan’s
  leadership style have no basis in reality and are rooted in sexism. [She] is a
  work horse, strong executor, and accountable leader who along with [acting Ice
  director] Todd Lyons is leading the men and women of Ice law enforcement to
  achieve the American people’s mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal
  illegal aliens.” The effort to recruit sheriffs “shows how both cruel and
  reckless this administration is when it comes to law enforcement”, added Juan
  Cuba, executive director of Sheriff Accountability Action, a group that
  advocates for criminal justice reforms. “It’s a complete disregard for one of
  the biggest issues local law enforcement has, which is recruitment and
  retention. Those challenges are exacerbated by the administration’s approach,
  but they don’t care. What they care about is hitting these artificial quotas,”
  he said, noting Trump’s demands for 3,000 immigration arrests a day. “It’s
  less about public safety and more about just feeding this mass deportation
  machine.” Some sheriffs do oppose efforts to have their deputies act as
  immigration officers, because they already feel stretched thin or are
  concerned about eroding public trust, Cuba noted. But publicly objecting can
  carry consequences, he said, noting that after Broward county’s sheriff said
  he didn’t want deputies arresting people for civil immigration violations,
  Florida’s attorney general threatened to take steps to have him removed from
  office. “We see silence from police chiefs and sheriffs because of political
  threats,” he said. “It is very alarming that public officials feel like they
  can’t raise concerns.”
