  The $62m question: does a high school really need a professional-style
  stadium?

  When the television cameras pan around the US’s newest sporting temple to show
  the cavernous stands, elegant brick exterior, VIP suites and massive video
  board, viewers might believe they are looking at a professional venue. Yet the
  occupants of Phillip Beard Stadium, the Buford Wolves, are not a professional
  team or even a college one. They are high-schoolers. In the exorbitant world
  of high school football, Buford’s $62m, 10,000-capacity arena is not the
  biggest or most expensive taxpayer-funded student stadium in the US. But it
  may be the most luxurious. The Wolves host the Milton Eagles on Thursday in
  the stadium’s first regular-season game, which will be broadcast nationally on
  ESPN. With 13 Georgia state championships from 2001 to 2021 and a long record
  of players progressing to college scholarships and, eventually, the NFL,
  Buford is a football powerhouse – and the new stadium is a loud statement of
  the school’s desire to keep it that way. If it feels like half of Buford is at
  the big game … they probably are. The Atlanta-area city has roughly 19,000
  residents and the well-regarded high school (rebuilt in 2019 for $85m) has
  about 1,900 students. In 2010, another educational institution in the Atlanta
  region, Kennesaw State University, built a smart 10,200 capacity multi-use
  stadium for $16.5m. In the past 15 years, however, construction costs have
  soared, fan expectations have evolved, streaming and social media have changed
  how we consume sports and college athletes are now allowed to earn significant
  sums by monetising their personal brands. The trend is clear: newer, fancier,
  costlier. Phillip Beard Stadium has the typical uncovered benches familiar to
  anyone who’s seen Friday Night Lights. Yet it also boasts more than 1,500
  premium seats, 15 suites, a 3,600 sq ft double-sided video board and a 10,500
  sq ft event space with a trophy wall. Buford City manager Bryan Kerlin told
  the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the stadium had been paid for by the
  city general funds and its funding “had no impact on teacher salaries,
  classroom resources, or any educational funding”. Still, there may well be
  other parts of the city the money could have been diverted to. Besides,
  blending spartan spaces for students and high-end facilities for corporate
  clients and rich alumni is increasingly common. It could make financial sense
  for schools aiming to maximise revenues and claw back some of the construction
  and operating costs, according to Victor Matheson, an economics professor at
  College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. “The economics term is price
  differentiation,” he says. It’s long been common in professional sports as
  teams adopt a strategy beloved of airlines, with their myriad fare classes and
  options: charging wildly different amounts for the same product based on
  variations in the customer experience. As the masses in the cheap seats
  generate the noise, corporate boxes can deliver thousands of dollars in income
  per event, giant video screens appeal to advertisers, and perhaps former
  students who’ve been wined and dined in air-conditioned comfort and enjoyed a
  perfect view of the action will be inspired to make generous donations to the
  alma mater. Upscale new arenas are also a way to entice fans off the couch in
  an era when it seems like almost every sporting contest, no matter how
  obscure, is streamed. “Everyone knows their biggest competitor is being able
  to watch on TV,” Matheson says. Climate-controlled facilities mitigate against
  extreme weather, and with gargantuan video boards, televisions on concourses,
  myriad food and drink options and glitzy graphics on LED ribbon displays, fans
  can go to the stadium, experience the live atmosphere and still gaze at
  screens. Northwestern University in Illinois is building a privately-funded
  new stadium guided by the principle of “premium for everybody,” reports Front
  Office Sports. At a projected cost of $862m it will be the most expensive
  college stadium ever, yet with only 35,000 seats it will hold 12,000 fewer
  people than the venue it is replacing. The theory underpinning the design is
  that modern fans want a more intimate and luxurious experience, with changing
  tastes – and a changing climate – rendering even relatively recent venues
  obsolete. In 2020 Major League Baseball’s Texas Rangers quit their open-air
  48,000-capacity ballpark, which opened in 1994, for a new 40,000-capacity
  building with a retractable roof. This season a minor league baseball team,
  the Salt Lake Bees, moved from Smith’s Ballpark, which also opened in 1994, to
  a new home, hiking ticket prices and halving their seating capacity in the
  process. The concentration on high-end customers, of course, prices out fans
  who cannot afford to spend heavily on a night out at the game. “In all,
  premium seating makes up one-sixth of seats at the new ballpark, whereas it
  contributed to just 3% of Smith’s Ballpark’s capacity,” the Salt Lake Tribune
  reported. “The seats closest to the action aren’t available for sale on a
  per-ticket basis; instead, those are field-level suites that must be reserved
  in their entirety.” Sports’ growing focus on premium customers mirrors a shift
  in the American economy as a whole: this year a Moody’s Analytics study found
  that the US economy is now deeply reliant on the richest households, with the
  top 10% of earners accounting for 50% of consumer spending, a sharp rise from
  recent decades. Logically, better facilities should breed better players, with
  victories leading to bigger attendances, swelling civic pride, adding to the
  appeal of the fast-growing suburbs where large high school stadiums are often
  located and boosting the prospects of the kids who dream of reaching the NFL.
  The trickle-down effect from the professional and college ranks to high
  schools isn’t only a matter of swankier facilities. It’s also visible in the
  potential financial incentives. College players have been permitted to make
  money from their name, image and likeness (NIL) rights since 2021. In June
  this year a former high school player filed a class-action lawsuit in
  California challenging restrictions on the ability of the state’s high school
  student-athletes to profit from their NIL rights. It could pave the way for
  high school stars across the US to earn income and to transfer to other
  schools for sporting reasons. “Corporations see a lot of untapped economic
  value in high school athletics,” Yaman Salahi, an attorney representing the
  player named in the suit, said in a statement to Front Office Sports, “and we
  want to ensure that value is shared equitably with the athletes that create
  it.” Like teenaged soccer starlets at professional clubs in other countries,
  16- and 17-year-old American football players might one day be wealthy and
  famous, with a status to match the grandeur of their home stadiums. “The
  difference here is that it’s the local public school that’s doing the
  development,” Matheson points out. For now, stadiums as sizeable and expensive
  as Buford’s remain rare outside Texas, the state that is the centre of the
  high school football infrastructure arms race. In 2017 the independent school
  district in the Houston-area suburb of Katy opened a $70m, 12,000-capacity
  stadium adjacent to its existing and still operational 9,800-seat venue.
  According to the website TexasBob.com, more than a quarter of the 1,267 high
  school football stadiums in Texas can hold over 5,000 people, with eight
  seating at least 16,500. The combined capacity of 4.4 million is larger than
  the populations of 24 states. About a quarter have video scoreboards and 27
  high school stadiums have opened in Texas since 2020. A $56m multi-purpose
  venue in the Houston-area city of La Porte is set to host its inaugural match
  this month. Texas produces more NFL players than any other state, found a
  study by the data analysis firm Lineups, with Houston the leading city. On the
  other hand, Texas is ranked 34th for educational attainment by US News &amp;
  World Report, is far below the national average for teacher pay and
  expenditures per student, and according to one study, this year Texas teachers
  expect to spend on average $1,550 of their own money on classroom supplies.
  Many would argue there are better things to spend money on than school sports.
