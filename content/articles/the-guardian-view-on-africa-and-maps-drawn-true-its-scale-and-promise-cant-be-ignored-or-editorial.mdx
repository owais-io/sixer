  The African Union wants to replace the world’s most popular map with one that
  more accurately represents the continent’s size. This demand may seem better
  suited to geography departments than heads of government. Yet in politics,
  symbols matter. And the Mercator projection, devised in the 16th century to
  help European sailors navigate their way to conquest and commerce, has quietly
  shaped how we see the world for centuries. By stretching the higher latitudes
  and squeezing the equatorial belt, the Mercator projection distorts the
  relative size of continents. Europe and North America loom vast, while Africa
  and South America shrink. Greenland often appears roughly the same size as
  Africa, when in reality the continent is 14 times larger. The impression is
  that the north is large and central, the south peripheral and marginal.
  Cartographic distortion would be forgivable if it were confined to sailing
  charts. But for generations of policymakers – and of children – the world has
  been presented through a lens that flatters the powerful and diminishes the
  rest. The academic Mark Monmonier, in his book Rhumb Lines and Map Wars,
  counters that empires were driven by politics and economics more than
  classroom atlases – a point echoed by critics who say Mercator has become
  overrated as a tool of western imperialism. It is true that colonialism didn’t
  need maps to justify itself, but maps helped to naturalise its worldview.
  There are also better alternatives to Mercator. The Equal Earth projection,
  introduced in 2018, gives a truer sense of area while retaining a visually
  intuitive layout. Earlier attempts, such as the Goode homolosine or the Peters
  projection, made similar efforts to redress the balance. None is perfect.
  Representing a sphere on a flat plane requires compromise. But the point is
  not perfection; it is honesty. And honesty requires acknowledging distortion
  where it matters most. It’s a long-running debate, but for many it was
  popularised by Aaron Sorkin’s West Wing TV drama. In a famous scene from 2001,
  a group of earnest cartographers explain to a White House press secretary how
  Mercator has misled generations into believing Greenland is the spatial equal
  of Africa. The exchange plays for laughs. But it also delivers a serious
  truth. Start from the wrong map, and you risk ending with the wrong
  conclusions. That observation has a broader resonance. Leadership depends on
  an accurate starting point. Whether in business or politics, vision without
  truth is fantasy. The West Wing moment was seen as being about leadership.
  Great leaders, the thinking runs, succeeded not only by imagining the future
  but by demanding clarity about the present. And clarity begins with the facts,
  not the distortions of old prejudice – whatever the real-life occupant of the
  West Wing thinks. The Mercator projection was born, undoubtedly, of European
  priorities in an age of empire. To continue using it as the default projection
  is surely to perpetuate those priorities. By contrast, adopting, say, Equal
  Earth is not only more geographically sound but emblematically important. It
  makes clear that Africa won’t be diminished in print when, in fact, it is vast
  in scale and promise. Critics may scoff that changing maps is only symbolic.
  But symbols mould perception, and perception drives decisions. Draw Africa
  small and it is treated as small; draw it true and its scale and potential
  become harder to ignore. The African Union seems more right than wrong. It
  offers not pedantry, but leadership.
