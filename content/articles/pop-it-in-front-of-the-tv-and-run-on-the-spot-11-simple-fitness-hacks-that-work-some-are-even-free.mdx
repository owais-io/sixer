  The fitness industry has sold you a lie. It said the expensive gym membership
  would give you beautifully toned abdominals. It told you your metabolic woes
  could be solved by taking a little green pill each morning. It even promised
  to meet your body’s daily nutritional needs with a convenient bottle of
  Orwellian sludge … all at a price. The reality is that getting fit is
  alarmingly simple: move more, be consistent and repeat. Here are the tips and
  affordable kit that have helped real people – our readers – get fitter,
  including everything from a trampoline to a dog. *** Easy fitness tips and
  tricks *** Adjustable weights I stay active by doing yoga and pilates at home.
  I wanted to incorporate resistance training to build muscle, too, but I live
  in a small flat and don’t have room for racks of dumbbells. So I bought an
  adjustable set instead. They’re stored on the bookshelf in my home office when
  I’m not using them. TJ Corength 20kg dumbbell kit £39.99 at Decathlon £42.98
  at Debenhams NordicTrack 25kg Select-A-Weight adjustable dumbbell set £349 at
  John Lewis £349 at Boots *** Easy-sip water bottle I found that having a
  CamelBak water bottle with a bite valve and straw has really improved my water
  intake. Not having to remove a cap or even tip the bottle made taking regular
  sips an almost unconscious action, massively boosting my hydration. Nick
  CamelBak Eddy water bottle, 750ml £20 at Argos £15.05 at Amazon *** Rebounder
  Aching joints and persistent plantar fasciitis have forced me to hang up my
  running shoes. Instead, I’ve dusted off my cheap folding rebounder – a mini
  trampoline – and I’m loving it. I pop it in front of the TV and run on the
  spot to 180bpm tunes. Sometimes, I even put a virtual run video on YouTube
  (Singapore, NY, Tasmania – take your pick). If I want to dial up the
  intensity, I add weights on my ankles and wrists. It definitely gets the heart
  racing. Not sure I’ll ever go back to running. It’s saving me a fortune on
  expensive trainers. Jo S Domyos Fit Trampo 100 cardio fitness trampoline
  £34.99 at Decathlon £39.99 at Asda Domyos 2kg adjustable wrist/ankle weights,
  pack of two £19.99 at Decathlon £22.98 at Debenhams *** Running club The best
  money I’ve ever spent on fitness is joining my local running club. The annual
  membership gets me weekly coached sessions, weights/core sessions during
  winter months, trail-running groups, monthly races against other local running
  clubs and lots more. It’s also been invaluable for making new friends and
  connections in the area. Since joining, I’ve run my first half-marathon in
  seven years and knocked five minutes off my 5k PB. Not bad for £45 a year.
  Andy Carne *** Running shoes I recently completed the Couch to 5k running
  programme. Investing in a pair of good trainers that suited my personal
  running form gave me the motivation to keep going. As it turns out, trainers
  are technical things, and it’s not a one-style-suits-all approach. Who knew! I
  took a free gait assessment at a local running shop, and they recommended a
  shoe style for my natural forefoot strike (the Saucony Guide 18). The
  difference in comfort is incredible. Rachel Saucony Guide 18 trainers From £87
  at Saucony £129.50 at M&amp;S *** A dog I was 68 and diagnosed with severe
  emphysema when I adopted my dog. Getting up the stairs was hard enough. I had
  to stop and catch my breath to stop feeling dizzy. Four years on, and I’m
  walking about 90 to 100 miles a month; my emphysema is now classed as mild.
  Overall, I’m fitter than I was 15 years ago. She’s been my personal trainer
  and my beautiful companion. Dave Garroch *** Calorie-tracking app Many people
  don’t understand how many calories are in a handful of nuts or a few biscuits.
  Understanding how much energy is in common foods can be quite an eye-opener
  for people. My younger brother, who’s not a fitness person at all, started
  using an app to see how many calories are in the foods he eats and was
  horrified to learn how quickly he hits his daily sugar allowance by having a
  chocolate bar and a can of Coke. Matt Kollat MyFitnessPal app Free (or premium
  for £19.99/mth) at MyFitnessPal *** Bodyweight exercises I do pilates and
  calisthenics at home. Bodyweight workouts allow you to do so much with so
  little. I use kitchen worktops for dips and a set of basic wooden bars that
  cost about £30 to do all my pressing movements, such as push-ups. Pretty low
  cost and highly effective. I ride a bike for cardio, too. Graeme Gaughan
  Wooden parallettes bars £26.99 at Amazon *** Parkrun As a new runner, I found
  parkrun made me accountable. It makes you get up and actually go. I think when
  you have to be there on a certain date and time, you’re less inclined to just
  sack it off. I can go at my own pace, and it’s busy with runners of all
  abilities, so I don’t feel self-conscious about how fast I’m going or what I’m
  wearing. I find I go faster in a group too, so it helps me to improve from
  week to week. Katie Crosby *** Hi-vis belt I’ve always liked the idea of
  commuting to and from work, but I found riding a bike in the city
  intimidating. I got a hi-vis belt for next to nothing, and it has boosted my
  confidence. I now ride to the office every day, and I’ve lost weight doing so.
  It just goes over whatever you’re wearing and folds up small enough to fit
  into a backpack pocket when not in use. Sarah Proviz Flexi viz cycling/running
  belt £14.99 at Proviz £16.50 at Decathlon *** Always walk The biggest shift in
  my fitness came when I changed my mentality around movement. I decided to
  never take the easy option. If it’s a choice between escalators and stairs,
  I’ll take the stairs. Toss up between hopping in the car and a 30-minute walk?
  I’m walking. I’ve applied this to everything I do, and it has worked wonders.
  I also make sure to do at least 10,000 steps every day, non-negotiable. If I
  haven’t hit it by the time I’m home from work, I get out and make up the
  numbers! So simple, but so effective for keeping the weight off, not to
  mention better for the planet. Christoph Has something made you fitter and
  healthier? Let us know by emailing thefilter@theguardian.com *** Paddy
  Maddison is a consumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.
  If he’s not hiking in the hills, he’s grinding up them on his bike, hurtling
  down them on his snowboard, or lacing up his running shoes and hitting the
  pavements. As a result, he gets plenty of time to put all the latest gear
  through the wringer for the Filter
