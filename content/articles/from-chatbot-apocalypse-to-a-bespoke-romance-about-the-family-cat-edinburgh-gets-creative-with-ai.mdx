  From chatbot apocalypse to a bespoke romance about the family cat: Edinburgh

  Every new technology unsettles us because it confuses our boundaries. The
  radio announcer who appears in our living room; the movie star we see on a
  screen; the relative’s voice we hear on a phone: they all mix up our sense of
  the real and the imagined. So it is with artificial intelligence. A poem
  generated instantly by ChatGPT feels as magical to us – and as magically wrong
  – as the first printed books must have done to an illiterate population,
  unschooled in mystical Latin. How to account for something that communicates
  like a human being, yet is not physically present? It is an uncertainty that
  haunts the AI-themed plays on this year’s Edinburgh fringe. It also accounts
  for their apocalyptic mood. Do we even have a future, they all seem to ask, or
  are we bequeathing it to the machines? Take Dead Air, in which playwright
  Alfrun Rose stars as Alfie, a kind of female Hamlet. Like Shakespeare’s
  vacillating hero, she communes with her dead father and grows furious with her
  mother for hooking up with a new man, John, an old boyfriend. As Alfie sees
  it, John is in line to become her stepfather with unseemly haste. The
  difference with Hamlet is that her dad is no ghost but an AI simulacrum,
  powered by a service called AiR. For as long as she pays the subscription (no
  easy feat), Alfie can hang on to her dead dad and hang on, too, to her sense
  of survivor’s guilt and unfinished business. The online service, with its
  chirpy operatives and Stayin’ Alive hold music, supplies her with a
  nearly-but-not-quite reproduction of the real man. If something feels off, she
  can switch the temperature controls to turn him from mechanical to fanciful.
  Whether he is a comforting replacement or a cynical means of data mining is a
  moot point. The question Rose raises in an absorbing storytelling show is less
  about the limits of digital technology and more about processing grief.
  Alfie’s fury with her mother and rage about John is little to do with them
  (they seem as perplexed by her outbursts as Gertrude and Claudius are by
  Hamlet’s) and a lot to do with her miscarriages. Conflating the death of her
  father with the loss of her children, she is frozen into inaction. Having a
  virtual father only prolongs her inertia. Whatever this AI father is, however
  lifelike, he can never be the real thing. The AI chatbot played by Elisabeth
  Gunawan in Stampin’ in the Graveyard also purports to have our interests at
  heart. She is there, she explains, authentically stiff-jointed, to ease our
  transition to the end of the world. Her name is Rose and if she starts
  hallucinating, as AI is wont to do, a rose graphic flashes up on screen.
  Through an interface that is all glitches, network errors and messages saying
  “Not applicable is not applicable at this time”, she polls the audience to
  guide her through optional storylines. Each show plays out with a different
  combination of scenes in a tech-savvy production co-created with movement
  director Matej Matejka for Kiss Witness. Hard to say what the story adds up to
  – it is a catastrophic tale that begins with a couple seeking marriage
  guidance from a vending machine and ends with forced separations and closed
  airports – but it is fascinatingly done with the audience tuning in on
  headphones and Gunawan playing a steampunk synth-accordion hybrid created from
  recycled electronics. If this is the future, we are in for a world of computer
  errors and digital indifference, a hostile place for our messy human
  interactions. Tackling the technology even more directly, New York’s Angry
  Fish Theater and the Ally Artists Group use AI to generate a bespoke script
  for each spectator. Before the start of AI: The Waiting Room – An Audiovisual
  Journey, you fill in a questionnaire, truthfully or otherwise, about your
  ambitions, loved ones and legacy. By the time you are in the theatre, there is
  a custom-built story ready to play out in your headphones, delivered by a
  freakily realistic voice. The sections unique to you are folded into a bigger
  tale, experienced by everyone, about societal breakdown and hi-tech
  rejuvenation. Nobody else will ever hear my yarn about a sugary moon, a bag of
  gold and 61 statues. This is a good thing, much as I enjoyed the novelty of
  hearing a romantic story about me and the family cat. All this takes place as
  we move freely around a studio, watching a monochrome animation (perhaps also
  artificially generated) and following instructions intended to make us play
  characters in our stories. These demands for audience participation seem
  forced – especially a misjudged prompt to “dance party?” – but it is a
  quirkily intriguing attempt to be humanly creative with this inhuman
  technology. • Dead Air is at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 August. Stampin’ in
  the Graveyard is at Summerhall until 25 August. AI: The Waiting Room – An
  Audiovisual Journey is at Studio at C Arts until 16 August • All our Edinburgh
