  It was about 10.30am on Tuesday when 10 police visited a property in
  Victoria’s high country, just outside Porepunkah, to execute a search warrant.
  The property contained a house and adjoining bus, and was dotted with chestnut
  trees. Behind it was thick bush, and Mount Buffalo loomed overhead. As the
  officers made their way up the drive, they were being watched. Soon, they were
  fired upon. Two of them were killed, a third was injured, and the man
  allegedly responsible was fleeing through bush he had known for decades. That
  man is Dezi Freeman, born Desmond Filby, a “sovereign citizen” with a
  self-confessed hatred of police. Freeman liked to think of himself as an
  outlaw, fighting against the tyranny of government, and now he is on the run
  in bushranger country. The Victorian chief commissioner, Mike Bush, said in a
  press conference late Tuesday that his officers, a 59-year-old detective and a
  39-year-old senior constable, were “murdered in cold blood”. Another detective
  has undergone surgery, but his injuries are not life threatening. Freeman
  allegedly ran into the bush, heavily armed, alone. It was all over in minutes,
  and yet there is no telling how long the pain and possible recriminations will
  linger. The seven other officers involved in executing the warrant pursued
  him, and then stayed on the property for several hours more while it was
  secured, Bush said. It is unclear whether police fired their weapons or if
  Freeman has the weapons of the officers who were killed, but Bush confirmed
  the fugitive had several firearms. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  fugitive was known to police, and a risk assessment was carried out before the
  warrant was executed, he said. Bush was unable to say whether police had
  changed their process for executing such warrants since two Queensland police
  officers were ambushed and killed by conspiracy theorists in a shootout at
  Wieambilla in December 2022. Nor could Bush say why that assessment did not
  recommend the inclusion of specialist squads such as the Special Operations
  Group, or other scenarios, such as arresting the fugitive away from the
  property. But he did say the involvement of 10 officers suggested police had
  given some consideration to the risk posed by the man who lived on the
  property. This risk assessment would have considered the likelihood of Freeman
  being armed. It is unclear if he was a registered firearms owner, but given
  his interactions with police this is unlikely: Freeman told a court last year
  that the force had cancelled his firearms licence. The guns he used in the
  attack were described as powerful long-arms, which could include rifles or
  shotguns. Freeman had a long history of public pronouncements about his
  beliefs, including inside and outside court. On social media, he shared a film
  poster for the 1970s made-for-television Western, I Will Fight No More
  Forever. He also shared a photo, which he said he had taken over the Kiewa
  Valley, to the south-east, about two decades earlier, that he claimed had once
  been used in tourism brochures in the area. Like many others, Freeman appeared
  to become radicalised during the pandemic, and railed against the restrictions
  imposed by governments, which were seen as reinforcing his conspiratorial
  beliefs. The AFP, in a briefing released under freedom of information laws in
  2023, elaborated on the threat posed by sovereign citizens. “What we’ve
  learned is while these groups present and behave very differently to other
  extremist groups, there is an underlying capacity to inspire violence,”
  Stephen Dametto, the acting assistant commissioner of counter terrorism and
  special investigations, wrote in the presentation. “As COVID-based
  restrictions and mandates begin dissipating around the country, time will tell
  whether we see these movements fade into obscurity or whether they become a
  more enduring fixture of the threat landscape in Australia.” Dametto added
  that “SovCits see violence as a last resort or only necessary in the form of
  ‘self-defence’ against a tyrannical government”. Bush said there was no reason
  to believe the suspect had left the area, and that every available officer had
  been deployed in the manhunt. Almost a decade ago, the force used similar
  resources in the same region while hunting armed fugitives Mark and Gino
  Stocco, who had also shot at police. Like that pair, Freeman is also said to
  know “bushcraft” well. He will need to: heavy rain, damaging winds, and snow
  above 1000 metres are forecast for the region on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Bush
  spoke from the police station in Wangaratta, the home town of the former
  premier Daniel Andrews, whom Freeman, along with many sovereign citizens, had
  a particular disdain for. Wayne Gatt, the Police Association Victoria
  secretary, who joined Bush in the town, said that “a shocking and eerie
  feeling of dread” would have filled every police station in the state. The
  fear that existed in the back of every officer’s mind, the fear of paying the
  “ultimate price”, had been thrust into an awful reality. Police had not been
  able to find Freeman’s wife and two children, who also lived at the property
  and were originally thought to have possibly been with him, for several hours,
  but the family went to a police station late on Tuesday. “There is nothing to
  suggest they were ever in the company of the suspect following today’s
  incident,” police said in a statement. Bush, who only started in the job two
  months ago, urged the man on the run to bring a peaceful end to the carnage.
  “My message to that person is give yourself up so that the community can be at
  peace, and we can have this matter resolved peacefully.”
