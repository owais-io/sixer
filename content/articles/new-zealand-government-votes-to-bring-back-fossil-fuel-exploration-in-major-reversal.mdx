  reversal

  New Zealand’s government has voted to resume oil and gas exploration despite
  an outcry from the opposition and environmental groups who argue the reversal
  will lay waste to the country’s climate credentials. In 2018, the Jacinda
  Ardern-led Labour government banned the granting of new offshore oil and gas
  exploration permits as part of its plan to transition toward a carbon-neutral
  future. Environmental groups hailed the ban as a milestone in the fight
  against climate change, and commended New Zealand for standing up to “one of
  the most powerful industries in the world”. But on Thursday afternoon, the
  ruling right-wing coalition voted to reverse the ban after the third and final
  reading of the crown minerals amendment bill – a move it believes will
  alleviate energy shortages and high energy prices. The bill passed by 68 votes
  to 54. “The ban sent a chilling message to the investment community, halting
  the very exploration that underpins our energy security and leading directly
  to the supply constraints and price volatility that we see today,” climate and
  energy minister Simon Watts told parliament. “In times where renewable
  production decreases, it is clear that we need contingency options to ensure
  that Kiwis are not left footing a bigger bill, and to ensure that we have
  sufficient supply.” The bill formed part of the minor populist New Zealand
  First’s coalition agreement with the larger centre-right National Party and is
  the latest in a run of controversial government policies that environmental
  groups believe threaten New Zealand’s unique biodiversity, natural resources
  and path toward a greener future. In 2024, the government passed a law that
  could see contentious mining and infrastructure projects fast-tracked for
  approval, while in May, the coalition set aside $200m of its budget to invest
  in gas exploration. In June, New Zealand pulled out of the Beyond Oil and Gas
  Alliance, an international coalition for phasing out fossil fuels. The
  coalition government plans to boost mineral exports to $3bn by 2035, and at
  the same time has slashed funding to conservation and climate initiatives. The
  government has said these policies will enable economic growth. Opposition
  parties were united against the bill, with Labour’s Megan Woods calling it “an
  ideological desire to look to the past instead of investing in the future ”.
  Steve Abel, from the Greens, said the decision to restart oil and gas was
  “shamefully regressive” and efforts to bring back investors would be “futile”.
  New Zealand’s vote to restart fossil fuel exploration comes just one week
  after the world’s top court ruled that states must tackle fossil fuels and
  failure to prevent harm to the climate could result in them being ordered to
  pay reparations. Dr Kayla Kingdon-Bebb, the chief executive of WWF New
  Zealand, called the legislation “egregious” and “deranged”. “We are yet again
  dangerously off track and putting our international reputation in the
  shredder,” she said. Meanwhile, an 11th hour amendment to the bill would
  weaken the law that requires oil and gas permit holders to pay for the
  decommissioning and clean-up of wells, said Dr Jen Purdie, a senior research
  fellow at the University of Otago’s centre for sustainability. Rules around
  the clean up of decommissioned wells were strengthened in 2021, after
  taxpayers had to pick up a NZ$400m bill for decommissioning the Tui oilfield
  after the oil company collapsed. “Weakening these laws re-opens the prospect
  of taxpayers paying for clean-up,” Purdie said.
