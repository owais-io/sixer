  A last stretch of this strange, uneasy summer remains. Between now and
  September, there could conceivably be further outbreaks of the kind of
  violence that rightwing politicians and their media allies have been
  frantically predicting. But for now, behold a fascinating spectacle: a country
  quietly refusing to chaotically combust, despite being endlessly encouraged to
  do so. One word in particular symbolises the gap between hyped-up rhetoric and
  everyday reality. “Tinderbox”, was first used in the mid-16th century to
  describe a crude instrument for starting fires: a container that carried a
  piece of flint and steel, and a pocketful of the dry, flammable material that
  gave the device its name. With the invention of matches, the use of such
  implements fell away, and the word began its passage to how it is used today:
  as political shorthand for any situation supposedly on the brink of explosion.
  And here we are: over the past few weeks, “tinderbox” has become an
  inescapable cliche. At the end of July, the Institute for Public Policy
  Research published a report to mark the first anniversary of 2024’s riots,
  which claimed that the loss of communities’ shared spaces – pubs, youth clubs,
  community centres – can create “tinderbox conditions for violence”. At around
  the same time, the protests and violence outside hotels used for people
  seeking asylum began to attract the self-same description. “We need an
  emergency cross-party cabinet to stop tinderbox Britain exploding,” wrote a
  columnist in the Daily Telegraph. The former home secretary Sajid Javid warned
  that the UK is “sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division”. And not
  long after, his one-time colleague Robert Jenrick – now the shadow justice
  secretary, and a man on constant manoeuvres – told the Today programme that
  “the country is like a tinderbox right now”. All this noise is part of a much
  bigger political development: a ballooning narrative about complete social
  breakdown. Just as people on the left have been predicting for at least 150
  years that capitalism is about to chaotically implode under the weight of its
  own contradictions, so some of the loudest voices on the post-Brexit right
  have come up with their own version of a similarly historic meltdown: a vision
  of the immediate future in which rampant wokery, crime, failed immigration
  policy, weak policing and general establishment decay and corruption will lead
  inexorably to what Nigel Farage calls “societal collapse”. The Reform UK
  leader is now well into his summer of crime campaign, a breakneck run of
  pronouncements dispensed from behind a lectern adorned with the slogan
  “Britain is lawless”. He says that “the social contract between the governed
  and the government is on the edge of breaking down”. And for months – if not
  years – helpful mood music has been provided by elements of the rightwing
  media. Again, the comment section of the Telegraph offers no end of examples:
  a newspaper that was once a byword for the political stiff upper lip now
  constantly offers such warnings as “Britain is lurching towards civil war, and
  nobody knows how to stop it”. All this echoes the kind of con trick used by
  reactionaries and authoritarians down the ages: warning of the country’s
  supposedly likely collapse in the hope that the rest of us support all the
  hardline policies they say would stop the rot. In Farage’s case, apocalyptic
  rhetoric feeds the idea that now things are so bad, the public ought to take a
  chance on his completely untested party. But also, the warnings of imminent
  social breakdown from Tory and Reform UK politicians often sound quietly
  gleeful, as if they believe that some great moment of rupture is exactly what
  Britain needs, to wake up from its slumber. Their talk always comes with
  caveats: Farage, for example, follows “Goodness knows what may happen over the
  course of the summer” with “We would encourage people to protest quietly and
  sensibly.” But, like Jenrick, he still sounds like someone with an alarmingly
  ambivalent view of unrest and chaos. Both of them make hyped-up claims of
  “two-tier justice” and draw questionable connections between migration and
  crime, which are much easier to popularise online than the comparatively
  complex reasons why they are specious. Put simply, they warn of disorder while
  recklessly rattling the tinderbox. Over the weekend, all this hit a new low.
  Friday and Saturday saw another spate of hotel protests, in locations
  including Portsmouth, Bristol, Nuneaton and Norwich. Compared with predictions
  of massed disorder, not much happened: a much bigger story, in fact, was the
  arrest of more than 400 people at demonstrations against the proscribing of
  Palestine Action. So, for want of a better story, the Mail on Sunday gave
  Jenrick – as ever, with the air of a callow opportunist flirting with mob
  politics – its front-page splash. “I certainly don’t want my children to share
  a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain
  illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing,” he said. The accompanying
  messaging was less than subtle: an inside spread put a picture of Jenrick and
  his three daughters at what looked like a middle-English fete, next to an
  image of smiling young men “aboard a boat in France yesterday”. Just to be
  clear, the grim scenes that have materialised at those hotels are the signs
  not just of far-right activism and provocation, but broken policy. No one
  should underestimate how much the grooming gangs scandal has given many people
  a deep fear about the safety of women and girls, not least in places that have
  long felt ignored and neglected. But it is perfectly possible to acknowledge
  those plain facts while also highlighting something equally obvious: that the
  spectacle of politicians knowingly peddling inflammatory narratives is
  nauseating – and that, in the absence of the kind of countrywide immolation we
  were warned about, they are starting to look like desperate people throwing
  matches on kindling that refuses to ignite. That is a remarkable way for
  self-styled patriots to behave, and it would be nice to see a few Labour
  politicians loudly making such an obvious point. But we probably shouldn’t get
  our hopes up. Out in the real world, a lot of places suggest a social
  condition much more complicated than we hear from the prophets of British
  armageddon. The other week, I spent 36 hours in Pontefract, a classically
  post-industrial northern town that is part of the constituency represented by
  Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. Rather than a picture of incipient chaos
  and seething rage, it presents something much less dramatic: the feeling of a
  place that remains reluctantly locked into decline, but that also has a
  palpable and defiant community spirit. Its local council faces an £88m budget
  deficit over the next five years, and is in the midst of even more cuts; the
  everyday scene on its main streets suggests a quiet stoicism that the forces
  responsible for its predicament really don’t deserve. Neither Farage nor
  Jenrick’s parties offer anything that would assist its renewal and revival.
  The people who live there, in fact, deserve something a lot better than
  warnings that they are about to be plunged into civil war and social meltdown
  – issued, as ever, by the kind of privileged and cynical politicians who
  follow a time-honoured script: warning of apocalypse while keeping a very safe
  distance from the places they say are about to go up in flames. John Harris is
