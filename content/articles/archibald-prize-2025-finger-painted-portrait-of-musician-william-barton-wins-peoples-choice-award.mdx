  Artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the 2025 Archibald prize people’s choice
  category for her portrait of didgeridoo/yidaki player William Barton, painted
  entirely with her fingers. Spirovski, a four-time finalist at the Archibald
  prize, Australia’s most prestigious portraiture award, won the $5,000 people’s
  choice category, picked from the Archibald prize finalists each year by the
  public. This year 40,842 votes were cast, the highest number of votes ever
  received. Spirovski said it was “overwhelming and deeply humbling” to win the
  category. “I am infinitely grateful to William for allowing me to paint him
  and so humbled by everyone’s responses to the work,” she said in a statement.
  “It has been a difficult few years and this whole experience is the most
  beautiful reprieve and reward. Barton is a Kalkadunga man and acclaimed
  composer who is regarded as a virtuoso in the yidaki, playing the Indigenous
  instrument with classical orchestras around the world. In the past he has said
  it is his wish “to take the oldest culture in the world and blend it with
  Europe’s rich musical legacy”. Spirovski and Barton met last year at a concert
  at which Spirovski’s husband, the concert pianist Simon Tedeschi, and Barton
  both performed. When Barton came to sit for her, Spirovski was recovering from
  thoracic outlet syndrome and carpal tunnel, which made it painful to hold a
  brush – but on the day, she was suddenly inspired to paint with her fingers
  instead. “I had never painted with my hands before, beyond a little bit of
  blending,” she told Guardian Australia. “It was a completely spontaneous
  decision – it didnt even feel like a decision, it was automatic. There was
  zero doubt. It was pure instinct, which is a beautiful feeling.” The painting
  was finished in four days; finger-painting was “very efficient” compared to
  working with brushes, Spirovski said: “It is like having seven brushes in
  one!” Barton told Guardian Australia on Thursday that he had just returned
  from touring Europe when he found out. “It has been a whirlwind. I’m really
  chuffed that Loribelle’s magic is being recognised,” he said. “I was very
  honoured to be painted by her.” That the public had chosen a portrait of
  himself was “very humbling” he said, “because what Loribelle has painted is
  not just me, it is the journey of Kalkadunga Country and it comes from a
  sacred place.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Spirovski was born in
  1990 in the Philippines, to Filipino and Serbian parents, and immigrated to
  Australia when she was eight years old. Mostly self-taught, Spirovski was
  previously an Archibald finalist in 2017, 2018 2019. The Art Gallery of New
  South Wales hosts the Archibald each year. On Thursday the AGNSW director,
  Maud Page, congratulated Spirovski for her “well-deserved win and for her
  magnetic portrait of William Barton, rendered with expressive paint strokes
  and lit by Barton’s radiant smile”. The $100,000 Archibald prize was won by
  Julie Fragar in May, for her portrait of fellow artist Justene Williams. The
  104-year-old prize is awarded to the best portrait of a person “distinguished
  in art, letters, science or politics” painted by an Australian resident. Abdul
  Abdullah’s Archibald portrait of his friend and fellow artist Jason Phu won
  him the $3,000 packing room prize, which is decided by the AGNSW staff who
  hang the paintings each year. The Wynne prize for landscape painting and
  figurative sculpture, and the Sulman prize for genre, subject and mural
  painting are also awarded alongside the Archibald each year. This year the
  $50,000 Wynne prize went to Jude Rae for her painting Pre-dawn Sky over Port
  Botany Container Terminal, while the $40,000 Sulman prize went to Gene A’Hern
  for his work Sky Painting. A record 2,394 entries were received across the
  Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes this year, with more than 70% of finalists
  across the three awards being female artists. All finalists in Archibald,
  Wynne and Sulman prizes 2024 will be exhibited at AGNSW until 17 August. The
  Archibald finalists will then tour to Geelong, Gosford, Muswellbrook, Mudgee,
  Shoalhaven and Coffs Harbour later this year and in 2026.
