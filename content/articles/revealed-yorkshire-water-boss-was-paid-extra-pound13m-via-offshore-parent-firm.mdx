  The boss of Yorkshire Water, one of Britain’s biggest water suppliers, has
  received £1.3m in previously undisclosed extra pay since 2023 via an offshore
  parent company, the Guardian can reveal. Nicola Shaw received £660,000 from
  Yorkshire Water’s Jersey-registered parent company, Kelda Holdings, in the
  2023-24 and the 2024-25 financial years. The size of the fees was not
  disclosed in the annual report of the regulated subsidiary, Yorkshire Water
  Services. The utility company at first refused to detail the pay Kelda
  Holdings had awarded Shaw, saying the parent company was a “private entity
  registered in Jersey and subject to separate disclosure frameworks”. Only
  after the Guardian raised questions about the ability of MPs and bill payers
  to scrutinise the pay awarded did the company reveal the amount of the two
  payments. Yorkshire Water said it complied fully with the regulator Ofwat’s
  requirements on pay disclosure and bonus payments, and that the extra payments
  relating to work for Kelda Holdings were paid by shareholders, not bill
  payers. Regulated water companies must report directors’ pay in their annual
  accounts each year, but there is no obligation for parent companies to
  disclose their pay to the regulator or the public. Companies in some offshore
  secrecy locations, including Jersey, have no obligation to reveal executive
  pay. Water companies have come under intense scrutiny in recent years amid
  outrage over the sewage flowing into Britain’s rivers and seas at the same
  time as significant bill increases. Politicians and campaigners have expressed
  their anger over the million-pound pay packages awarded to top executives, but
  the Guardian last week revealed that average pay for chief executives still
  rose by 5% in the 2024-25 financial year. The government moved in June to ban
  bonuses for the bosses of water companies guilty of the worst environmental
  breaches. Yorkshire was one of six companies caught by the bonus ban, after it
  agreed a £40m payment in March for excessive spills from storm overflows as a
  result of poor maintenance. It received another £850,000 fine on Thursday for
  pumping chlorinated water into a stream in 2017. Gary Carter, the national
  officer for GMB, a union representing water workers, said: “This is another
  case of water companies not listening to the outrage and concerns of the
  public over the payment of unjustifiable salaries. “The fact that this salary
  is hidden and not transparent just further undermines the reputation of water
  companies. This sort of behaviour has got to end.” Yorkshire’s published
  accounts reported that Shaw’s pay from that company had dropped by nearly a
  third in the 2024-25 financial year, from £1,028,000 the year before to
  £689,000. The accounts, however, also said that Shaw and the chief financial
  officer, Paul Inman, had received remuneration from Kelda Holdings, which “is
  therefore disclosed in the financial statements of that company”. But Kelda
  Holdings has no duty to file accounts publicly because of Jersey’s relatively
  lax laws, and Yorkshire at first declined to say what she was paid by the
  parent company. Singapore’s government owns a third of Kelda Holdings, with
  the US investor Corsair Capital, Germany’s DWS and the Australian pension fund
  SAS Trustee Corporation owning the rest. The refusal to disclose the pay did
  not appear to breach any rules, but it meant that MPs and bill payers had no
  way of knowing whether Shaw’s total pay had increased since the bonus ban. The
  company said Shaw did not receive performance-related pay from Kelda Holdings,
  but did not share Kelda’s accounts. The revelation of the extra payments means
  that Shaw’s total pay from Kelda Group for the two years were £1.7m and £1.3m.
  Inman received £440,000 from Kelda Group in 2024-25, on top of a salary of
  £662,000. A Yorkshire Water spokesperson said: “We do not believe that any
  work our chief executive does on investor-related activities should be paid
  for by Yorkshire Water customers. For that reason, fees in 2024-25 for work
  such as investor engagement, financial oversight and management of the Kelda
  Group were £660k and were paid for by shareholders. “This fee reflects the
  critical importance of the work during this period that was led by Nicola, and
  as a result, shareholders directly invested £500m into Yorkshire Water to
  support the delivery of critical investment over the next five years, with a
  further commitment of £600m before the end of March 2027.” The Labour MP for
  York Central, Rachael Maskell, said: “With pipes bursting and rivers
  contaminated, it is shocking to learn that Yorkshire Water’s boss has
  concealed her £1.3m award. When people across Yorkshire faithfully pay their
  water bills, they expect better. “This behaviour makes the case why water
  should return to public ownership and those at the top held accountable for
  every penny spent and every benefit taken. I trust that Labour’s expected
  audit reform and corporate governance bill will ensure transparency across
  utility companies, when introduced.”
