  The partial return of UN inspectors to Iran for the first time since Israel
  and the US attacked Iran’s nuclear sites has been met with protests by
  officials in Tehran, who claim the strict preconditions they set have been
  breached. Some even described the return as criminal. Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s
  foreign minister, tried to quell the backlash by saying the inspectors from
  the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) would not be visiting any of
  the bombed sites, adding that discussions about these were still to be had. He
  said the return had been endorsed by Iran’s supreme national security council
  and added that the inspectors would be allowed to visit the Bushehr nuclear
  site to oversee refuelling only – a role required by the international nuclear
  non-proliferation treaty. Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, confirmed on
  Wednesday that inspectors were “back in Iran”. Iranian MPs complained the
  readmission breached the terms of a law passed in July that banned the UN
  watchdog’s return on a broad basis in the wake of the Israeli attack on Iran.
  The representative from the city of Khomeini Shahr, Mohammad Taqi Naqdali, led
  the protests, saying the breach was a criminal act. “We have approved a law in
  the assembly that any type of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy
  Agency will be suspended unless the territorial integrity, security of nuclear
  scientists, and inherent rights of Iran are fully ensured, and this is
  confirmed by the report of the Atomic Energy Organization [of Iran] and the
  supreme national security council,” he said. “If anyone acts against this
  resolution, they are guilty and will be sentenced to a sixth-degree punishment
  in circumstances where there is no more severe punishment.” The protests show
  the dilemma the government faces in balancing a surge in nationalist sentiment
  against the risk of further UN sanctions or even new Israeli attacks. The UK,
  France and Germany have long threatened to trigger a “snapback” of former
  sanctions when a 10-year-old nuclear deal struck with Iran expires on 18
  October. The three preconditions Europe has set out to avoid this are: Iran
  identifying the whereabouts of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium; the
  country permitting the full return of the IAEA inspectors that left at the
  start of the Israeli-US bombing campaign in June; and Tehran reopening talks
  with the US on its future nuclear programme. If this highly limited return of
  UN inspectors is enough to see off the return of sanctions, it will represent
  a bare-minimum concession by Iran. In a draft motion to be put to the UN
  security council, Russia is proposing to postpone the snapback for a further
  six months, giving Europe a further option if they feel Iran is serious about
  reopening diplomatic talks. If the Europeans do move ahead with a return to
  the sanctions lifted in 2015, the move cannot be vetoed by fellow security
  council members Russian and China, and would risk further inflaming relations
  between the west and Iran. The extra sanctions would not only reimpose the
  right to ban suspicious Iranian shipping, but also place a broader obligation
  on states sympathetic to Iran – such as China – to enforce the sanctions,
  since they have been mandated by the UN. Referring to Israel’s attacks on
  Iran, Grossi said: “If you want to prevent a repeat of what we saw in June,
  these [inspection] activities must be resumed.” He added: “We have been in
  continuous talks with Iran to create conditions for the return. It is not
  easy, because as you can imagine, some in Iran see the presence of
  international inspectors as detrimental to their national security, and some
  do not. So the question is what arrangements are needed so that we can return
  and do our job.” Grossi is currently under police protection following threats
  believed to come from Iran.
