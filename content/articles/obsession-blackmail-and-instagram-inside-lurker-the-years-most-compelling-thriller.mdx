  If Tom Ripley lived in LA in 2018 and was really into lo-fi bedroom pop, he
  might look something like the main character of Lurker. The debut feature from
  Alex Russell, The Bear and Beef writer-producer, is an elegantly creepy
  thriller about one super-fan’s scheme to become close to his musical idol,
  transposing author Patricia Highsmith’s “two-man theme” into a murkier grey
  territory, with parasitic attachment giving way to co-dependence that blooms
  into something that looks like a twisted kind of love. The lurker of the title
  is Matthew (Théodore Pellerin), an isolated twentysomething who lives with his
  grandma and works shifts at a local vintage boutique to make ends meet. After
  a chance run-in with his idol Oliver (Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe) at the
  vintage store where he works, Matthew worms his way into Oliver’s entourage
  and makes himself indispensable – first as a videographer, then confidante and
  then as someone who has the power to make Oliver’s enviable life come crashing
  down. “The thing I found relatable is that no one tells you how lonely being
  any version of an artist is,” says Madekwe. “Oliver needs someone outside the
  paid [members of his team] to say ‘Yeah, I fuck with it. I get it. You’re so
  real.’ He needs it because he knows that he’s a bit of a fraud anyway.” I’m
  chatting with the director and leads of Lurker at a swishy New York hotel as
  part of a busy day of interviews and photo calls. They’re getting through the
  week of promotion with a playful sense of humour, as well as a little
  fraternal rough and tumble. Earlier in the day, they filmed a social media
  skit which involves Pellerin perched on Madekwe’s lap, and Madekwe teases his
  co-star that he would be “so much better” in Pellerin’s role of Matthew.
  Madekwe did, in fact, initially audition for the role of Matthew. But it’s
  hard to imagine who could play him quite like Pellerin, a deserved arthouse
  darling after quietly compelling performances in Never Rarely Sometimes Always
  and Solo. In the Québécois actor’s hands, he’s both a grifter with a cruel
  coercive streak and a whimsical kid whose face lights up while dancing around
  the kitchen with his nan. After an oddly homoerotic hazing ritual – and advice
  from an entourage member (Zack Fox) to stop acting “like some kind of tour
  thot” – Matthew assumes a superfluous role of videographer with the crew.
  “There was something endearing about his awkwardness and his desperate need to
  be a part of something,” says Pellerin, sipping a matcha latte. “After being
  subjected to Oliver and his friends’ games and humiliations, there’s a
  decision of ‘I’m not going to let this happen any more, I’m going to up my
  game.’” He adds that the mindset reminded him of his experiences at school in
  Montreal. “I felt like that and tried that as a kid, when I was like, ‘I don’t
  want to be the one who gets rejected any more.’ It would work for two weeks,
  and then it wouldn’t. And it was like, ‘What can I do to have friends?’”
  Before shooting the film, Russell took Pellerin to some celebrity parties in
  LA, which bizarrely included Paris Hilton’s birthday party. Pellerin filmed
  what was unfolding on a handheld camcorder, and no one batted an eye.
  “Everyone’s already recording stuff on their phone,” says Russell. “In a way,
  someone with a camcorder is more wholesome.” The Lurker set sounds something
  like a party in itself, where Russell’s friends in the LA music scene would
  drop by to hang out with the crew. “Every day he was having the best day of
  his life,” says Madekwe. “But it was really useful because that’s not my world
  at all.” Plus it allowed Pellerin, who grew up speaking French and only
  learned English at 18, to master the scene’s vernacular. “It’s not my world at
  all, so on set I’d be trying it out” – he flips into the slurred voice of a
  SoCal stoner – “That’s crazy, bruh.” Set in pre-Covid LA, Lurker is
  holistically imbued with the first-hand experiences of Russell, who has
  written for music magazines such as the Fader and Complex and also co-wrote
  the Brockhampton short film Billy Star with band member Kevin Abstract.
  Russell’s career history likely has something to do with the film’s arch view
  of celebrity. Oliver’s music sounds like the kind of frictionless fare of a
  “beats to study to” playlist, and he seems to view Matthew as a kind of
  musical sensei based on his knowledge of Nile Rodgers … the most famous funk
  musician in history. I’m curious if Russell has heard of any real-life
  instances of the blackmail that his movie depicts. There’s a long pause before
  the director nods yes. He won’t name names, but he says that he’s “heard of
  this kind of thing happening”. Plenty of mediocre art has been made about
  social media obsession, a fact I am reminded of today as I wait for the trio
  opposite a large painting of a woman taking a selfie. Russell strikes a
  delicate tonal balance between the pulpy fun of 90s erotic thrillers, a genre
  which the director says he binged after writing Lurker, as well as the
  complexity of European arthouse. Even so, they’re game to lean into the
  movie’s popcorn pleasures, and tomorrow the trio will fly to LA for a live
  reading of Single White Female, which Madekwe cheerfully admits he hasn’t seen
  in full: “I started watching it in my hotel, I’m 40 minutes in!” While
  Russell’s movie hits similar pleasure centres to its 90s forebears – including
  the sexual tension between its leads – it respects its viewers enough to do
  away with straight-forward tropes of white knights and boogeymen. There is a
  version of this movie, I tell Russell, that is hopelessly corny. “The worst!”
  he agrees. “At every step, I was trying to run as far away from that as I
  could.” That fear didn’t quite dissipate until Russell stepped on set and saw
  his two leads nail the complex magnetism that draws them together. After
  shooting the scene in which they meet in the vintage store, Madekwe walked to
  the back of the set to chat to Russell, and found the director getting
  emotional while watching back footage of the actors. “I was like, ‘How you
  doing?’” recalls Madekwe. “And you were crying.” “I wasn’t crying,” laughs
  Russell, “but tears were welling up – tears of relief. Once I saw the two of
  them on the monitor I knew the tapestry of the whole thing would work.” Lurker
  is out in US cinemas now and in the UK and Australia soon
