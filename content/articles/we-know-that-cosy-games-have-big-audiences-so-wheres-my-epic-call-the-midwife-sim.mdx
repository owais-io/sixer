  We know that cosy games have big audiences – so where’s my epic Call the
  Midwife sim?

  I am 85 hours into Death Stranding 2, an apocalyptic nightmare about Earth
  becoming infected with death monsters, and I’ve realised that I’m playing it
  as a cosy game. For hours at a time, I trundle along the photorealistic
  landscapes in my pick-up truck, delivering parcels to isolated communities and
  building new roads. The only reason I complete the main story missions is to
  open new areas of the map so that I can meet new people and build more roads.
  I find it blissfully enjoyable. Of course, I am far from alone in playing
  video games this way. “Cosy games” have become a thriving cottage industry
  over the past five years, led by crossover successes such as Minecraft,
  Stardew Valley and Untitled Goose Game, but also housing hundreds of smaller
  titles that appeal to highly engaged communities. On Steam this month you’ll
  discover Catto’s Post Office, a delightful game about a feline postal worker,
  Fruitbus, a cute food truck management sim, MakeRoom, an interior design
  challenge, and Tiny Bookshop, which is about running … a tiny bookshop. Most
  of these games are united by the same elements: small teams, often young,
  often working remotely; short play spans; low-stakes challenges; and highly
  stylised visuals, as an aesthetic choice and an economic necessity. But why,
  if the audience for cosy games has been firmly established, aren’t there more
  lavish mainstream, triple-A examples? It’s clear producers such as Ubisoft, EA
  and Xbox are finding it tough to come up with fresh ideas – that’s why they’ve
  all spent (wasted) many millions trying to make the next identikit live
  service shooter to compete with Fortnite. So why not, I don’t know, try to
  make a big open-world adventure based around positive interactions and soft
  drama? The TV, film and book industries are crammed with this sort of stuff.
  Where is my video game version of Call the Midwife? Why can’t I ride a bicycle
  around 1950s east London delivering babies while faintly patronising decent
  working folk? Where is the video game equivalent of Downton Abbey or Gilmore
  Girls? Of course, I understand the most obvious answers. Like Hollywood,
  mainstream game development is largely based on minimising risk, and since the
  dominant cultural strand has always been action, violence and power fantasy,
  we inevitably end up where we are: with a thousand different combat adventures
  and not a single big-budget game about the love lives of a witty single mum
  and her sometimes exasperating daughter. But when we start to talk about
  culture rather than money, other factors come into play. “I think cosy gamers
  are a nuanced audience that values stories and mechanics over visual
  fidelity,” says Moo Yu, creative director at small studio Team Artichoke,
  which is making an adorable anti-capitalist puzzle game named Mythmatch.
  “While I do think big-budget cosy games are absolutely going to be developed,
  it is an audience that isn’t begging for one and is capable of appreciating a
  wider range of experiences at a wider range of price points.” This is an
  important detail – high-end visuals and vast open worlds aren’t necessarily
  the prize goal, they’re just one aesthetic and immersive option. Untitled
  Goose Game would perhaps not have been so amusing if the lovely village had
  been photorealistic and the horrible goose constructed from 100,000
  texture-mapped polygons. Stardew Valley is beautiful because it resembles a
  vividly colourful retro game, not despite it. Art is not just about slavish
  reproduction, thank goodness. Part of the cosiness of the cosy genre is the
  restriction of both choice and outcome; the game takes your hand and says come
  this way, you are safe. My lifelong friend Jon Cartwright is a veteran game
  developer who mentors small studios in Australia and New Zealand. When I
  emailed him about all this he replied: “When I think of a cosy game, I think
  of limited scope/size. And that’s been a function of them broadly being
  developed by smaller indie teams with limited budgets. But I think with the
  overload of … well, everything going on in the world, and especially during
  the stress of Covid, having a small, safe environment with low stakes gameplay
  was a really untapped market. The fact that the visuals were ‘simple’ was
  another source of comfort and charm.” Charm is hard to replicate – it won’t
  materialise because you’ve developed an expensive new graphics engine, or
  because you have 500 staff working on it for 18 hours a day. You can’t build
  hi-tech charm centres in the desert. It can happen in big games, just like it
  can in big TV dramas, but it’s a limited and unstable commodity. And in fact,
  the whole notion of the cosy game as an identifiable genre or deliberate play
  metric is still relatively young; games for so long, were mostly about
  winning. The verbs and adjectives of games about being nice to people have yet
  to be formalised. There’s a hoary old cliche that games are the opposite of
  film because explosions are cheap but a closeup shot of a human face showing
  emotion is wildly expensive. You could say that, in an interactive medium with
  historically limited visual naturalism, it’s been easier to create drama
  through having someone shoot at you than ask you on a date. But we have a
  hundred years of animation history to show us how charm, cosiness and
  emotional intimacy can be drawn from the most symbolic and stylised palettes.
  Moo Yu is certain that mainstream, naturalistic cosy epics will happen – in
  fact, he cites the fashion-focused role-playing game Infinity Nikki as an
  example. Until then, I will be in Death Stranding 2, having to fake care about
  chiral contamination and extinction entities just so I can rescue kangaroos,
  visit inventors and drive my truck through irradiated landscapes of
  considerable beauty. Sometimes you have to play their game to win your own.
  What to play August is proving a spectacular month for retro arcade
  collections and I cannot resist recommending one more before I regretfully
  return to the 21st century. Operation Night Strikers is a collection of four
  acclaimed Taito shooters from the late-1980s including the seminal light gun
  blaster Operation Wolf, essentially an interactive combination of the action
  flicks Rambo and Commando. Also here are its decent sequel Operation
  Thunderbolt, plus two lesser-known greats – cyberpunk flying car shooter Night
  Striker and Space Gun, a frenetic take on Aliens, complete with face huggers
  and flame throwers. As usual for modern collections, save functions have been
  added, and if you get the Switch version, you can use your JoyCon as a
  makeshift light gun. It’s not very accurate, but it’ll remind veteran arcade
  dwellers of using Operation Wolf’s original mounted Uzi gun controller. These
  colourful, fast and ridiculous popcorn games perfectly capture the spirit of
  the era, with their smooth scrolling 2D backdrops, banging electro-pop
  soundtracks and monosyllabic, muscle-bound heroes. You’ll be back. Available
  on: PC, Switch Estimated playtime: 10-plus hours What to read In a story that
  will strike a chord with anyone who remembers the antics of Veruca Salt,
  McDonald’s Japan has had to cancel a Pokémon promotion due to massive food
  waste and rampant scalping. According to Eurogamer, an exclusive Pikachu card
  was made available as part of a limited-edition Happy Meal deal, but fans
  queued for hours, got into fights and discarded their unwanted food in the
  streets. Inevitably, scalpers were out in force attempting to horde the cards,
  which are now on auction sites at vastly inflated prices. It’s always worth
  reading Rob Fahey’s industry essays on GamesIndustry.biz. This week he looks
  at the unsuccessful success of PlayStation, analysing why and how the console
  is raking in revenue, despite plenty of mis-steps, including the seemingly
  obligatory pivot to live service, which has failed to yield any noticeable
  rewards. Has it really been 20 years since Xbox achievements changed game
  design? To mark the occasion, AV Club has written an interesting analysis of
  their arrival, focusing on how gamers reacted to having their dopamine
  reserves so heavily commodified. What to click Mandrake – the rural life sim
  that lets you befriend a river and eavesdrop on the dead Tiny Bookshop – a
  truly cosy escape made with readers in mind ‘It’s not just football with
  blood’: Fear FA 98 is the Silent Hill meets Fifa 98 mashup we never knew we
  needed Bernband’s alien landscape is the perfect place for digital wandering –
  just don’t expect a map Question Block This one came in from Rich John on
  BlueSky: “Is it healthy for the industry to have a juggernaut like GTA VI
  sucking up lots of the headlines and (expectedly) money? How does it impact
  other publishers?” Well, put it this way: no major games company is going to
  be putting up its big hope for 2026 in the same launch window as Rockstar’s
  long-awaited behemoth. When the game was originally slated for a late 2025
  launch, three triple-A developers told industry newsletter the Game Business
  they were giving it a wide berth. This can be hugely disruptive to development
  teams who may have spent years planning for a specific release slot – it can
  also create a media and marketing black hole, where for a few weeks, no one is
  interested in anything else. However, it’s not all bad. When GTA V arrived in
  2013, it didn’t destroy everything in its path – casual mobile games such as
  Puzzle &amp; Dragons and Candy Crush did fine, as did titles with dedicated
  fanbases such as World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. Also, a massive hit like
  GTA brings wider attention, interest and potentially investment to the whole
  industry, and there is plenty of money to be made from releasing similar
  titles in the wake of the original – Grand Theft Auto spawned a whole genre of
  gangland adventures from Saints Row to Sleeping Dogs, while also lending
  innovative new design features to the entire market (GTA Online was, after
  all, the original live service experiment). So yes, it’s healthy. Kind of. The
  immediate financial shock can be challenging for other studios, but GTA V
  showed that casual gamers and dedicated fans of other franchises didn’t
  abandon everything and flock to Rockstar. Furthermore, the aftermath of a
  spectacular success can open new opportunities. After all, before Star Wars,
  no Hollywood studio would have touched a big budget sci-fi flick, but in the
  following years, we got Alien, Blade Runner, The Thing and the Star Trek
  movies. Success is inspiring – even when it happens to our rivals. If you’ve
  got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the
  newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.
