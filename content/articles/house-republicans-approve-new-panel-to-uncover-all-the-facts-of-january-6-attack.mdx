  House Republicans have voted to establish a new subcommittee to reinvestigate
  the January 6 attack, a move that comes as Donald Trump has tried to rewrite
  the history of the most violent incident in US Capitol history. Language to
  set up the Republican-led subcommittee was folded into a larger rule that
  passed along party lines. The new subcommittee follows Republican claims that
  the previous Democratic-led committee was biased against Trump. The vote comes
  seven months after House speaker Mike Johnson first announced the new
  subcommittee in January, saying that it will “uncover the full truth that is
  owed to the American people”. On his first day in office, Trump issued 1,500
  “full, complete and unconditional” presidential pardons to people who were
  involved in the attack, including those who were convicted of violent acts.
  The new Republican-led subcommittee will be chaired by Barry Loudermilk of
  Georgia, who will have full subpoena authority. When Loudermilk formally
  introduced the resolution to establish the subcommittee in July, Johnson said:
  “House Republicans remain intent on delivering the answers that House
  Democrats skipped over.” Speaking on Capitol Hill, Loudermilk said: “I’m
  grateful for speaker Johnson and my Republican colleagues for entrusting me to
  continue this important investigation into the events surrounding January 6,
  2021.” He added: “While my previous investigation did an incredible job last
  Congress, there is still much work to be done. Our goal is to answer the
  remaining questions, uncover all the facts, and implement reforms so this
  level of security failure never happens again. It’s time to finish the job.”
  The new subcommittee will have eight members appointed by Johnson, and not
  more than three members appointed “in consultation” with the Democratic
  minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to the resolution, the subcommittee
  is “authorized and directed to conduct a full and complete investigation and
  study and issue a final report of the events surrounding January 6 2021”. The
  formation of a new subcommittee has largely been decried by Democrats as a
  Republican-led attempt to exonerate Trump over his involvement on January 6
  and rewrite the narrative of that day’s deadly attack. The final report of the
  new subcommittee is expected to be submitted by 31 December 2026. In 2022, the
  initial January 6 subcommittee released an 845-page report on the attack,
  concluding that based on false allegations that the 2020 presidential election
  had been stolen, Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to the capital
  on January 6. The report also found that Trump refused repeated requests over
  several hours that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave
  Capitol Hill.
