  Hold music. There must be a better way. You have already had to come to terms
  with disappointments on your long journey to your heart’s desire: a fellow
  human with whom to converse somewhere deep in the bowels of a company’s
  customer service department. First, there’s the dismay, if not surprise, when
  you find it’s not a person who has answered the phone. Then there’s the
  enervating torture of listening to the long list of options from which to make
  your selection. The most I’ve ever been offered is seven. SEVEN! For added
  annoyance you may well then be told that a) your call is important to them and
  b) that they’re experiencing more calls than usual. The latter is a certain
  precursor to the dreaded hold music. I’ve seen research by the University of
  York for the virtual network operator Talkmobile. More than 2,500 participants
  were subjected to hold music of various genres, as well as alternative audio,
  including nature sounds, trivia and silence. Trivia came out best – or rather
  least irritating; metal, as in heavy metal, came bottom. Interestingly, in all
  the years I’ll never get back that I’ve spent listening to hold music I’ve
  never once come across trivia or metal. Either would have made a nice change.
  It also emerged, to no great surprise, that if what is playing turns out to be
  on a loop, everyone hates it. It’s almost a doom loop, strongly suggesting you
  are on a quest without end. I’ve never understood why they do this. Why loop
  anything? Surely it’s not because of a shortage of tape? I’ve been doing
  battle with the Co-operative Bank’s hold music for years. The tune itself
  isn’t bad. But it is looped. And even worse, the way it is edited suggests
  someone has picked up. Cruel, so cruel. New thinking, the research concludes,
  is needed. Press 1 for “Oh really”; press 2 for “Of course it bloody well is”.
  One suggestion is to give customers the option to choose between music,
  silence or trivia. It’s all going to be so much fun listening where this goes
  that I hope nobody ever picks up. • Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist
