  In our throwaway consumer culture, giving gifts can feel like a whole lot of
  pressure: get it wrong and that present will end up in the back of a cupboard,
  being given away again or, at worst, in landfill. The trick is finding
  something timeless but not boring; something well made and useful. We asked
  you for the gifts you’ve given or received that are still treasured (and going
  strong) years – often decades – later. *** Gifts that last A well-made T-shirt
  In 1995, I gave my new girlfriend a striped sailor T-shirt from French brand
  Armor-Lux. Heavy cotton quality. She told me I was crazy for giving her a
  T-shirt that cost 100 deutschmarks. Thirty years on, she is my wife and still
  loves to wear the shirt. It looks a little worn, but it must have had many
  more than a 1,000 washes. The product is still available and made in Brittany.
  Beat that value, fast fashion. Mark Kaminski Women’s Breton striped shirt £48
  at Armor Lux From £27.95 at Amazon Men’s Breton striped shirt £54 at Armor Lux
  £90 at John Lewis *** Timeless toys My sons were given a Brio train set when
  they were toddlers and spent hours playing with it (they are now 36 and 37).
  We kept the set, hoping for grandchildren. We now have two, and the trains are
  out again winding their way through our house, still as good as new. Brio is
  headed for family heirloom status in our house! Margaret Brio classic railway
  set £38.39 at John Lewis £38.40 at Hamleys *** Handmade pottery The best gifts
  I’ve given have all been handmade studio pottery. As a teenager in the 1980s,
  I started buying pieces from Field Row Pottery in Worthing (now closed) for
  family. You can always find a local potter making things you like. You can buy
  practical dishes; a salt-pig for the cook or foodie; vases or bowls for
  someone you know better; a mug for a colleague. Pottery lasts, good pieces are
  timeless and every home is better for having some. Dan Thompson One of my most
  treasured (and well-used) gifts is two hand-thrown mugs, which I use every
  day. Lisa Foreman Hand-thrown ceramic salt pig £44 at Etsy Ceramic mug and
  saucer £9.99 at Etsy *** Cast-iron cookware Nearly 55 years on, not many of my
  wedding gifts have survived. The one that has is the big orange Le Creuset pan
  that my sister gave us. It has been in regular use for all these years and,
  while it doesn’t look quite as beautiful as it did 55 years ago (and who
  does?), it still does its job just as well. Jenny My favourite present was a
  large Le Creuset enamel-lined casserole given to me in 1971 at my first
  wedding and still going strong. I use it to cook for my third, and definitely
  last, husband. Pam Smallwood Cast iron frying pan with wooden handle From £209
  at Le Creuset £219 at John Lewis Cast iron round casserole dish From £179.99
  at Wayfair From £209 at Le Creuset *** Versatile baby toys Minifolk silicone
  stacking cups are an excellent baby gift. I’ve bought a few sets since a young
  relative was particularly happy with the ones he received. They have numbers
  for learning to count and patterns and holes for use as water/bath/sand toys,
  all while taking up very little space. Angela Silicone stacking cups £13.99 at
  Etsy £15.99 at Amazon *** Classic umbrella I’ve had the Duckhead umbrella for
  almost 20 years – a bit of a miracle considering I received it as a birthday
  present when I was still at university. It’s a great-quality umbrella, and
  it’s hard to miss, which is perhaps how I’ve managed not to lose it. Monica
  Horridge £39 at Original Duckhead £40 at Selfridges *** Durable kitchenware
  When I married her son in 1974, my mother-in-law gave me, among many other
  things, a stainless steel measuring jug. I’ve been divorced for 33 years, and
  my dear, dear mother-in-law died last year, but the jug keeps rolling along
  with not a mark on it! Dot Unwin Vogue stainless steel measuring jug, 2l
  £19.54 at Nisbets £17.99 at Amazon *** Beautiful brooch In the summer of 1977
  I bought my girlfriend, Jackie, now my wife, a Victorian bar brooch. She
  continues to wear it, and it remains in good condition. It’s made of gold with
  seed pearls and diamonds. Best buy ever. Bob Victorian rose gold, aquamarine
  and seed pearl bar brooch £69.99 at eBay Gold poppy anemone brooch £28 at
  Fable England *** Nail file My friend gave me a glass nail file as a birthday
  present, and I’ve had it for 30 years. I use it most weeks because I’m
  constantly breaking my nails. It’s kinder on your nails than an emery board
  and gives a nice smooth finish. I always keep it in my handbag. Linda
  Pennington Tweezerman glass nail file £8 at Cult Beauty £5.60 at Amazon ***
  Practical apron My denim apron that my beloved bought me. It’s a piece of Jay
  Rayner ‘Out To Lunch’ merchandise [no longer available]. The quality is
  outstanding, it has POCKETS and washes up like new every time, which is great
  given the amount of cooking and mess I create weekly. Caroline Jackson
  Daylesford Organic Buckley denim apron £28 at Ocado £34 at Daylesford Organic
  *** Collector’s items My parents gave me my first Playmobil set as a Christmas
  gift in 1980 – the bandit with horse. It will be 45 soon and is still a prized
  part of my collection today: it’s in great shape, especially considering it
  went through rodeos, gym sessions, diving competitions and God knows what
  else. Tahra Playmobil pirates £15 at Argos £10.39 at Amazon *** Personalised
  jewellery For my 18th birthday, my sister gave me a personalised necklace with
  my initial engraved on to it. I still wear it all the time 10 years later.
  Imogen Barker Silver initial necklace £105 at Missoma For more, check out 12
  affordable jewellery brands, worn and rated for style and quality *** Travel
  essentials My friend bought me a turtle Elizabeth Scarlett eye mask years ago
  before I went travelling. It’s gone with me to Australia, New Zealand and
  beyond and it’s still going strong. A percentage of each sale goes towards
  animal conservation, which is an added bonus. Lucy Smith Turtle conservation
  eye mask £28 at Elizabeth Scarlett *** Sewing machine My Elna Lotus sewing
  machine is still going strong after 54 years. We’ve made clothes for the
  children, curtains and soft furnishings for four houses, gifts for other
  people and items to sell for charity. Alison Elna Lotus sewing machine
