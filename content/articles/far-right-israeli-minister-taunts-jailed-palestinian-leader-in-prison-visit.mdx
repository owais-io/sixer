  Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has posted video footage
  in which he is seen taunting the imprisoned Palestinian leader Marwan
  Barghouti in jail, prompting strong condemnation from Barghouti’s family and
  Palestinian leaders. The 13-second clip shows Ben-Gvir, a far-right politician
  on whom the UK and several other countries imposed sanctions this year for
  incitement to violence against Palestinians, making threatening remarks to
  Barghouti while Israel’s prisons minister, Kobi Yaakobi, an ally of Ben-Gvir
  stands nearby. Barghouti, 66, who was jailed by an Israeli court in 2002 for
  his role in planning several killings during the second Intifada, appears
  gaunt after being held in solitary confinement for years. He is detained in
  Ganot prison, in central Israel, and is almost unrecognisable. Ben-Gvir’s
  visit had been described as being part of the pursuit of a policy of stricter
  conditions for Palestinian prisoners, but the emergence of the video suggests
  the footage may have been its primary purpose. “You won’t win. Whoever messes
  with the nation of Israel, whoever murders our children and women, we will
  wipe them out,” he says. “You should know this, [this happened] throughout
  history.” Ben-Gvir, the leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, said this
  year that “there is no reason for a gram of food or aid to enter Gaza”. He
  serves as the national security minister despite a conviction in 2007 for
  incitement to racism and supporting a terrorist organisation. Barghouti, who
  is sometimes compared to Nelson Mandela, is a senior figure in Mahmoud Abbas’s
  Fatah movement and is hugely popular in in the West Bank and Gaza. He is seen
  as one of the few figures who could meaningfully reconcile rival Palestinian
  factions. Palestinians have long sought his release, reportedly including him
  in recent hostage negotiations, but Israel has refused. The footage of
  Barghouti shows the first images of him in a decade. The organisation that
  represents Palestinian prisoners has alleged that Israeli prison officers have
  assaulted him; a claim Israel has denied. In the video, Barghouti, who is
  standing in a white T-shirt, tries to speak, but Ben-Gvir interjects and the
  short clip ends. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the incident,
  describing Ben-Gvir’s actions as “organised state terrorism”. The Palestinian
  Authority vice-president, Hussein al-Sheikh, described it as “the epitome of
  psychological, moral and physical terrorism”. The emergence of the footage
  follows similar grandstanding this week by Ben-Gvir’s fellow far-right
  minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who said he would “bury” the idea of Palestinian
  statehood after announcing a huge new illegal settlement construction.
