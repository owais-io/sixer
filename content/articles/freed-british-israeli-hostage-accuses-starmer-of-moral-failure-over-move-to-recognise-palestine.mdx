  recognise Palestine

  A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas for more than 15 months
  has accused Keir Starmer of “moral failure” after he set the UK on course to
  recognise a Palestinian state. Emily Damari, 29, who was released in January,
  said the prime minister was “not standing on the right side of history” and
  should be ashamed. Her criticism came as lawyers representing British families
  of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas said the UK government’s intention to
  recognise a Palestinian state ran the risk of disincentivising the release of
  captives. Starmer said on Tuesday that the UK would recognise a Palestinian
  state in September unless the Israeli government abided by a ceasefire and
  committed to a two-state solution to the conflict. The UK government also said
  Hamas must release all hostages immediately, disarm, sign up to a ceasefire
  and accept it would play no role in the government of Gaza. In a post on
  Instagram, Damari said: “Prime Minister Starmer is not standing on the right
  side of history. Had he been in power during World War II, would he have
  advocated recognition for Nazi control of occupied countries like Holland,
  France or Poland? “This is not diplomacy – it is a moral failure. Shame on
  you, prime minister. “As a dual British-Israeli citizen who survived 471 days
  in Hamas captivity, I am deeply saddened by Prime Minister Starmer’s decision
  to recognise Palestinian statehood. This move does not advance peace – it
  risks rewarding terror. It sends a dangerous message: that violence earns
  legitimacy.” Damari was shot in the leg and hand when she was dragged from her
  home in the Kfar Aza kibbutz on 7 October 2023. She was taken from the safe
  room of her house with her friends Ziv and Gali Berman, twin brothers who are
  still being held in Gaza. Since her release as part of a ceasefire deal,
  Damari has campaigned for the release of about 20 hostages believed to be
  still alive and for the bodies of about 30 dead hostages to be returned to
  their families. In a separate statement, Adam Rose and Adam Wagner, who have
  represented relatives of hostages who are either British or have close British
  ties since 7 October 2023, said the UK had made the hostages a “bargaining
  chip”. They said: “The risk is that Hamas will continue to refuse a ceasefire
  because if it agrees to one this would make UK recognition less likely.” The
  families they represented had asked Starmer to “confirm, unambiguously, that
  Hamas will not be rewarded and that the UK will not take any substantive steps
  until all the hostages are free”. They added: “For almost two years, the
  British hostage families have encouraged the UK to use any leverage it has to
  help secure the release of their loved ones. They have sat in 10 Downing
  Street with successive prime ministers and foreign secretaries who have looked
  them in the eyes and promised the UK will do everything in its power to secure
  the immediate and unconditional release of their loved ones, whose detention
  is unambiguously a war crime. “We are concerned that the UK’s proposal risks
  delaying the release of the hostages. This is because the UK has said that it
  will recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees a ceasefire. But the
  risk is that Hamas will continue to refuse a ceasefire because if it agrees to
  one this would make UK recognition less likely. “The families are therefore
  deeply concerned that the UK’s approach risks disincentivising Hamas from
  releasing the hostages. This risks doing exactly what the prime minister’s
  statement says the UK will not do: reward Hamas for its heinous and illegal
  acts.”
