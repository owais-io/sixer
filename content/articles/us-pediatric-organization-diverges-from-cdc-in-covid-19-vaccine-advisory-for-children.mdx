  children

  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is urging that children as young as
  six months and up to 23 months receive the Covid-19 vaccine – a position that
  diverges from the current federal guidance given by the Trump administration’s
  health agencies. The AAP released its updated childhood immunization schedule,
  which outlines recommendations for vaccines against Covid-19, influenza and
  RSV for individuals under 18. “It differs from recent recommendations of the
  advisory committee on immunization practices of the CDC, which was overhauled
  this year and replaced with individuals who have a history of spreading
  vaccine misinformation,” the organization said in a statement. The
  announcement follows a decision from the health and human services secretary,
  Robert F Kennedy Jr, in late May to halt CDC recommendations for healthy
  children to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Previously, the CDC advised
  vaccination for everyone six months and older with the latest available dose.
  The CDC currently advises that Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six
  months through 17 years should be determined through “shared clinical
  decision-making”. The AAP recommends vaccination for anyone under 18 who is at
  higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19, resides in a long-term care or
  congregate living facility, has not previously been vaccinated or shares a
  household with someone at elevated risk. “The academy has been making
  pediatric immunization recommendations since the 1930s. That has not changed,”
  Dr Susan Kressly, president of the AAP, told ABC News. “But what has changed
  is that this year, we’re doing it in the environment of misinformation, which
  makes it more important than ever that we provide clear and confident
  guidance, because the majority of American families really depend on us for
  this guidance.” The AAP says infants and toddlers between six and 23 months
  face the greatest risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 and vaccination
  offers protection against serious illness. Even as medical groups continue to
  disagree with federal agencies, insurers often base coverage on guidelines
  from the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). If ACIP
  declines to endorse a vaccine, families may have to pay out of pocket, and the
  shot may not be provided through the federally funded Vaccines for Children
  program. The US Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) communications
  director, Andrew Nixon, responded to the AAP’s updated recommendations with
  the following statement: “The American people deserve confidence that medical
  recommendations are based solely on science and public health. We call on the
  AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications
  free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the
  best interests of America’s children. Instead, the AAP is undermining national
  immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks.” The statement
  continues: “Secretary Kennedy has stood firm in his commitment to science,
  transparency, and restoring public trust. By bypassing the CDC’s advisory
  process and freelancing its own recommendations, while smearing those who
  demand accountability, the AAP is putting commercial interests ahead of public
  health and politics above America’s children.” Kennedy also responded, posting
  on social media on Tuesday a screenshot from the AAP’s website that listed
  corporate donors to the Friends of Children Fund, an AAP program that directs
  donations to pediatric health projects. Kennedy accused the group of failing
  to sufficiently disclose conflicts of interest. “AAP is angry that CDC has
  eliminated corporate influence in decisions over vaccine recommendations and
  returned CDC to gold-standard science and evidence-based medicine
  laser-focused on children’s health,” Kennedy wrote. He went on to accuse the
  AAP’s vaccine recommendation list of being “corporate-friendly” and added:
  “AAP should follow the lead of HHS and disclose conflicts of interest,
  including its corporate entanglements and those of its journal–Pediatrics–so
  that Americans may ask whether the AAP’s recommendations reflect public health
  interest, or are, perhaps, just a pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial
  ambitions of AAP’s Big Pharma benefactors.” Kennedy’s restructured vaccine
  panel has maintained support for annual flu shots but voted to limit them to
  single-dose formulations without the preservative thimerosal. The AAP,
  however, maintains that the preservative is safe and says physicians should
  administer any approved flu vaccine suitable for the patient. • This article
  was amended on 21 August 2025 because the American Academy of Pediatrics has
  said that thimerosal is safe in appropriate amounts, rather than that the
  preservative poses no risks, as an earlier version said.
