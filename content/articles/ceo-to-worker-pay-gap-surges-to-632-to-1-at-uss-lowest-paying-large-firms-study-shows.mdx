  Some of the US’s lowest-paying large firms increased their CEOs’ compensation
  by an average of almost 35% over five years, according to new research. Their
  workers’ salaries did not keep up. As executive remuneration ballooned, the
  average CEO-to-worker pay gap across the 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 with
  lowest median worker pay – dubbed the Low-Wage 100 by the Institute for Policy
  Studies – widened by 12.9% between 2019 and 2024, from 560 to 1 to 632 to 1.
  “Median pay increased only modestly, whereas CEO pay really skyrocketed,” said
  Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for
  Policy Studies, and author of the report. Between 2019 to 2024, CEO pay at
  these companies increased by 34.7%, unadjusted for inflation, compared with a
  16.3% increase in these firms’ average median worker pay during the same
  period – short of inflation, which came to 22.6% over the same period. By last
  year, average CEO compensation in the Low-Wage 100 stood at $17.2m. Average
  median worker pay was $35,570. Of the 100 firms, median worker pay fell at 22
  between 2019 and 2024. Ulta Beauty reported a 46% drop in median worker pay to
  $11,078 as the company significantly expanded its part-time workforce.
  Starbucks’ CEO pay was the largest gap in 2024, with its CEO, Brian Niccol,
  receiving total compensation worth $95.8m, 6,666 times as much as the
  company’s $14,674 median pay. “It’s a stunning message for Starbucks
  management to send to their workers who’ve organized unions at 570 stores in
  recent years, and they’re still waiting for the company to negotiate a
  contract. It says a lot about who they really value at that company and who
  they don’t,” said Anderson. Starbucks did not respond to multiple requests for
  comment on the report. The IPS report cites a June roundtable hosted by the
  Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets regulator, on executive
  compensation disclosure requirements, where Drew Hambly, investment director
  at CalPers, the largest public pension fund in the US, described the negative
  impacts overcompensation of executives has on low-wage workforces. “I do want
  our boards to think more about the bottom 50% of people who work for them,”
  Hambly said. “Because when I go into a business, I’m probably interacting with
  a lower-wage worker. And if you’re going to drive value over time, that’s the
  face of your company.” In recent years US families have struggled with high
  costs for groceries and housing, and layoffs have been on the rise. “In the
  midst of all of this, CEOs are focused on making themselves even richer,
  instead of thinking about the welfare of their employees or even the long-term
  growth of their company,” said Anderson. “I think if they continue on this
  path, it’s going to be a trend that is bad, not just for workers, but for
  these companies and our economy as a whole.” Between 2019 to 2024, Low-Wage
  100 firms spent $644bn on stock buybacks. More than half spent more on
  buybacks than on capital improvements at their firms. Lowe’s spent $46.6bn on
  stock buybacks: $28,456 per each of the retailer’s 273,000 employees,
  according to the report. Home Depot ranked second in stock buybacks during
  this period, spending $37.9bn. The report also noted 32 billionaires owe their
  wealth to Low-Wage 100 corporations, including eight billionaires from
  Walmart, four from Estee Lauder and three from DoorDash. As policy solutions,
  the report highlighted support for a tax hike on corporations that pay their
  CEO at least 50 times more what they pay employees. It also urged policymakers
  to increase taxes on stock buybacks. Ulta Beauty, Lowe’s and Home Depot did
  not respond to requests for comment.
