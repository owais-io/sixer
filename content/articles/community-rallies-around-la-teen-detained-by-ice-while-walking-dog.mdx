  A southern California community is calling for the release of a high school
  student whom US immigration agents arrested earlier this month while he was
  walking his dog. Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz was supposed to be starting
  his senior year at Reseda charter high school this month. But just days after
  his 18th birthday, masked Ice agents detained him as he walking his dog in the
  Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys in what his family described as a
  kidnapping. The agents allowed his dog to run loose, and treated Guerrero-Cruz
  like a criminal and joked while arresting him, his family said in a GoFundMe.
  “He is more than just a student – he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a
  loyal friend, and a valued member of our community,” the family wrote, adding
  that he helps care for his younger brothers. “He is a good student, with a
  kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family.” Educators and advocates
  held a rally to bring attention to Guerrero-Cruz’s detention, demand his
  release, and call for answers from local officials, such as the Los Angeles
  unified school district superintendent, about the unmarked vehicle and
  plainclothes, masked men who took him on the morning of 8 August. “How can any
  of us turn a blind eye to cruel, unjust treatment happening right in front of
  us? Benjamin does matter; his rights matter,” Valerie, one of Guerrero-Cruz’s
  neighbors, who saw the teen in the unmarked truck before he was taken into
  custody, said during the Tuesday press conference. She told the downtown Los
  Angeles crowd she was walking her dog when she saw an unmarked SUV and several
  men who were wearing tactical vests and were either fully or partially masked.
  They were holding Guerrero-Cruz’s dog’s leash, but soon after Valerie
  approached one of the men unclipped the dog’s leash and let it run off, she
  said. Two of Guerrero-Cruz’s teachers also spoke at the rally and talked about
  the 18-year-old’s drive and determination to graduate, despite only recently
  coming to the US. “One of our own, Benjamin, a child who once sat in our
  classrooms who dreamed his dreams under our watch, was kidnapped by Ice,” said
  Claudia Rojas, who taught Guerrero-Cruz shortly after he came to the US. “This
  is not just his fight – it’s our fight. When one student is taken, all
  students feel the fear. When we stay silent, we give permission for the next
  child to disappear,” she said. Another of his former teachers, Liz Becerra,
  visited Guerrero-Cruz, at an Ice processing center in Adelanto, an hour and a
  half north of Los Angeles. She told the rally that Guerrero-Cruz relayed a
  harrowing tale of being surrounded by masked men while walking his dog, handed
  over to federal agents, and then brought to the metropolitan detention center
  in downtown Los Angeles. He was not allowed to shower or brush his teeth for a
  week, Becerra said. Now he is in Adelanto, where he told Becerra he is in a
  small cell with about two dozen other men with little access to food and
  water. “He wants to graduate. He’s made it this far based on his will and on
  his dream, and that’s being taken away from him,” Becerra said. “He’s in
  detention; he should be in a classroom with us.” The arrest comes as Donald
  Trump’s crackdown on immigrants continues to unfold across southern
  California, where thousands of people have been arrested this summer at
  workplaces, at stores and near schools. Los Angeles Unified school district,
  which has nearly 800 schools across the county, has adopted new strategies to
  protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe, supportive spaces for
  all children and families – regardless of immigration status”. “Schools are
  safe spaces,” Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSD superintendent, said in a
  statement. “Immigration enforcement near schools disrupts learning and creates
  anxiety that can last far beyond the school day.” Carvalho has said he is in
  communication with Guerrero-Cruz’s mother, who has alleged that the boy was
  being held with dozens of men, receiving water only once a day and
  insufficient food, in a space that doesn’t have enough room for everyone to
  sit or lie at the same time. Many have reported filthy conditions and not
  having access to clean clothes and towels for days at a time inside the
  detention facility Guerrero-Cruz is being held. His sudden arrest has sparked
  outrage in his community. Fellow soccer players said it was “heartbreaking to
  see him taken from us like this, and we’ll truly miss not just the player, but
  the person he was”. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement
  Guerrero-Cruz was being detained pending his “removal” from the US. “Benjamin
  Guerrero-Cruz, an illegal alien from Chile, overstayed his visa by more than
  two years, abusing the visa waiver program under which he entered the United
  States, which required him to depart the United States on March 15 2023,” the
  agency said.
