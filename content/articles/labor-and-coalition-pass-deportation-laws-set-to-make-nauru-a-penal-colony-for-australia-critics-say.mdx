  The major parties have been accused of “stitching up” a deal to transform
  Nauru into Australia’s “dumping ground and penal colony” as parliament passed
  laws stripping basic legal rights from a group of noncitizens set to be
  deported. The home affairs legislation passed the Senate on Thursday, after a
  snap three-hour parliamentary hearing the night before. The bill amends the
  Migration Act “to provide that the rules of natural justice do not apply” for
  noncitizens on a removal pathway and validates government visa decisions –
  made before the high court’s NZYQ ruling in November 2023 – that could
  subsequently have been deemed unlawful. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  home affairs minister, Tony Burke, struck a deal with Nauru last week to
  facilitate the removal of 354 members of the NZYQ cohort, a group of
  noncitizens living in the Australian community whose visas were cancelled on
  character grounds. The changes aim to speed up the deportation process by
  removing the cohort’s right to natural justice – and therefore further legal
  challenges – once the government decides to send them to Nauru. When
  introducing the bill, Burke argued procedural fairness was being abused by the
  cohort to “delay and frustrate their removal at cost to the commonwealth in
  circumstances where it is neither necessary nor appropriate for it to
  continue”. A hearing on Wednesday night heard the deal was expected to cost
  Australia at least $2.5bn over three decades, with Nauru banking $408m in the
  first year and $70m each subsequent year. The head of the home affairs
  department’s immigration unit, Clare Sharp, told the hearing most of the funds
  would be placed in the Pacific nation’s trust fund, which is jointly governed
  with Australia. The total amount was dependent on the number of people Nauru
  agreed to take. “If there are six people on Nauru, the majority of that
  [yearly] payment goes into a trust and sits in the trust, and should the
  agreement be frustrated and it never grows and never delivers, the trust could
  be clawed back,” Sharp said. With Coalition support, the bill was passed on
  Thursday afternoon, despite a strong rebuke from the crossbench. The
  independent ACT senator David Pocock said the bill was rushed and appeared to
  be against Labor’s values. The Greens senator David Shoebridge criticised the
  arrangement with Nauru as a “toxic deportation deal”. “We are meant to be
  treating our Pacific neighbours as friends. We’re meant to be treating them as
  equals. We’re meant to be treating them as partners,” Shoebridge said. “But
  instead, the Albanese government is literally bribing … our Pacific neighbours
  to become Australia’s 21st century dumping ground and penal colony.” Senators
  Mehreen Faruqi and Lidia Thorpe derided the major parties on a “race to the
  bottom”. “You praise migrants for what they bring to this country. You eat our
  food, you enjoy our festivals, but then you stitch up dirty deals with the
  Coalition to demonise us, because that is what this bill does,” Faruqi said.
  Sanmati Verma, legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the barely
  scrutinised passage of the “anti-fairness bill” showed the government wanted
  “to carry out a mass deportation of migrants and refugees of the kind we have
  never seen, without having to give a second thought to the lifelong
  consequences”. Verma argued the laws gave the government the power to exile
  people to Nauru without warning or a reasonable process. “Without having to
  ask even the most basic questions … whether a person will die in Nauru without
  proper care, be targeted for violence as other refugees have been, or be
  permanently separated from their family,” she said. “Clearly, the Australian
  government does not want to know the answers to these questions.” Verma said
  the government was contributing to the normalisation of racism and
  anti-migration sentiments across Australia. “The Albanese government is
  setting a new low for how migrants and refugees are treated, but our rights
  should be the same, regardless of visa status.” Jana Favero, the deputy chief
  executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the legislation stripped
  the most fundamental legal safeguard – the right to fairness – out of
  deportation decisions. She said the law validated flawed government decisions
  already made, cut off appeals currently before the courts, and gave the
  government sweeping powers to deport people to Nauru without notice or legal
  recourse. “The threat of deportation is now real for thousands of people:
  people who have Australian citizen family members, including children. This
  would cause permanent family separation.” Favero said the Australian
  government should be ashamed of its “secret” deal with Nauru. On Wednesday,
  the government refused to table its agreement with Nauru in parliament. Favero
  said it contained no cap on the number of people who could be deported and no
  transparency about how public money would be spent. The Asylum Seekers Centre
  said the new legislation gave the government the power to deport people
  without proper warning or the chance to challenge a decision – even when the
  government had made a serious error. “This legislation is a sweeping attack on
  the rights of tens of thousands of people, simply because of where they were
  born,” its chief executive, Elijah Buol, said.
