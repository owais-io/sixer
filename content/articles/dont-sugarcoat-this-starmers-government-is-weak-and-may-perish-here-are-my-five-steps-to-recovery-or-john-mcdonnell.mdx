  The Labour party is facing one of the most dangerous moments in its history,
  possibly an existential threat. Not only is it adrift in the polls, losing one
  council byelection after another, and with a leader whose popularity has
  plummeted; but the main threat comes from the xenophobic hard right in the
  shape of Reform UK. Labour has to wake up to this threat and seize the moment.
  It must take five basic steps to recovery: 1. Stop digging Most of Labour’s
  woes are of its own making. The winter fuel allowance debacle, the disability
  benefits cuts rebellion, the refusal to scrap the two-child limit on benefits
  and, of course, Gaza. Continuing to send arms to Israel that are used to
  murder children, refusing to break the aid blockade and deploying a contorted
  logic to delay recognition of the Palestinian state, merely compound things.
  Then to cap it all the proscription of Palestine Action resulted in the
  bizarre sight of an 83-year-old priest being arrested alongside hundreds of
  others – with more to come. So step one is to stop making ludicrous political
  decisions that are systematically alienating section after section of our core
  support, and masking much of the good work being undertaken by ministers in
  their departments. 2. Listen Step two is to simply listen to your supporters,
  party members, councillors and MPs. MPs are coming back from their
  constituencies with honest warnings of the anger at some of Labour’s policies
  and the behaviour of senior politicians, including the acceptance of tacky
  gifts and freebies. They have not only been ignored but have been met with
  threats of disciplinary action and even loss of the whip. The forcing of
  Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana out of the Labour party could have immense
  electoral consequences, which my colleague Richard Burgon has described as
  Labour losing votes to the left but, as a result, losing seats to the right.
  The complacent response from party strategists that Labour voters have nowhere
  else to go is no longer accurate as our supporters stay at home, vote Green or
  vote independent – or now could vote for the new leftwing party. This can be
  avoided by remaking our party as a truly representative broad church, where
  differences of view are not just allowed but welcomed for strengthening the
  process in which our decisions are made. 3. Stop mimicking Farage Step three
  has to be: stop dancing to Farage’s tune, stop aping his policies. Public
  understanding of asylum is largely shaped by the media coverage of the
  dinghies landing on our shores and the xenophobic rantings of Farage. Those
  images can be erased by swift decision-making and by establishing safe routes
  and returns, re-engaging with our European partners to create a Europe-wide
  strategy. Hotels would become unnecessary if asylum decisions are made swiftly
  and people are allowed to work, settle and contribute to our economy and
  society. After Brexit – and with an ageing population – our economy needs a
  wide range of skills to achieve the government’s growth objectives. To
  immediately reduce the numbers of those trapped in hotels waiting for a
  decision at present, the Refugee Council has proposed that we introduce a
  temporary amnesty for refugees from places such as Sudan, Syria and Eritrea,
  which are the countries from which asylum seekers are almost automatically
  given status at the moment. 4. Go big this autumn Although the asylum issue
  has risen in prevalence in the polls, I doubt if many people have had much
  direct engagement with asylum seekers. But they do have a daily engagement
  with the cost of living, balancing their income with their outgoings, dealing
  with ever-rising food and energy bills, their rent and mortgages, and
  frequently accessing local public services. The forthcoming budget could be a
  turning point on the issues that really shape people’s lives. We need a big
  budget. So step four is introducing a huge agenda-setting budget in which we
  begin to transform people’s lives by tackling the cost of living. A
  cost-of-living budget would use fair taxation of wealth and excess profits to
  address the grotesque levels of inequality in our society and the 14.3 million
  now living in poverty, including 4.3 million children. That could mean
  redistributing wealth by equalising capital gains tax with income tax and
  levying a windfall tax on the recent massive profits of the banking and
  finance sector. Likewise bringing forward a financial transaction tax to
  correct the anomalies of stamp duty on share sales, introducing a wealth tax
  on multimillionaires and developing a land value tax. Alongside measures to
  reduce costs such as rent controls, a fair taxation system would provide the
  resources to boost the rebuilding of our public services after 14 years of
  austerity cuts, and to overcome the years of public sector pay cuts and
  benefit freezes. The very best way of securing the growth the government is
  crying out for is to put money in people’s pockets, especially the people on
  low and average incomes who will spend, not hoard like the rich. But all of
  this will be to no avail without step five. 5. The spirit of Labour We
  desperately need a Labour government that behaves like Labour. That lives up
  to its traditions. That truly reflects the best of our country’s culture. It
  must be a Labour party that advocates for a caring society, where we aim to
  manage the economy and society in the interests of the many, and where we
  always live up to our international and humanitarian responsibilities and
  values. These are core requirements. If the current leadership are not capable
  of playing this role, then the question has to be asked about whether there is
  an alternative. For some, this will mean chancing support for the new leftwing
  party. For others, fearful of splitting the vote and opening the door for
  Reform, the alternative is a change of Labour leadership and a reclaiming of
  the party as what it should and must be: a truly democratic broad church of
  socialist and progressive opinion. John McDonnell is the MP for Hayes and
