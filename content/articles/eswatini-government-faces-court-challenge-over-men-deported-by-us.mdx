  A group of NGOs is challenging Eswatini’s acceptance of five people deported
  by the US, arguing the deal was unconstitutional and violated the imprisoned
  men’s human rights. The men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba, who
  the US said were dangerous criminals, were flown to the small southern African
  country in July, as the Trump administration attempts to deport millions of
  migrants and asylum seekers. The men’s imprisonment, at the maximum security
  Matsapha correctional centre, caused outrage in Eswatini, formerly Swaziland,
  whose king, Africa’s last absolute monarch, appoints the prime minister and
  cabinet. A group of NGOs and activists filed a legal challenge against the
  government last week, arguing that the deal, whose terms have been kept
  private by the government, violated due process and that the prison where the
  men were being held was 190% over capacity. The Southern African litigation
  centre (Salc), whose programme manager is one of the plaintiffs, said at the
  time: “This litigation signals to the continent and the world that African
  nations cannot serve as dumping grounds for unresolved issues.” Eswatini’s
  attorney general, Sifiso Khumalo, told Reuters the case had no basis, adding:
  “It’s a frivolous legal application.” The US had previously deported 252
  Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they spent more than four months in a
  notorious prison before being returned to Venezuela. Eight men were sent to
  South Sudan after spending weeks in a shipping container in Djibouti. Uganda
  and Rwanda have also agreed to take in deported people. The high court case
  was postponed to 25 September and may be referred to the constitutional court
  by the high court judges, the Salc said. Mzwandile Masuku, a lawyer for the
  applicants, said: “The judge was of the view that the pleadings or papers in
  the judge’s file were not complete, meaning the matter is not ripe for
  argument.” In papers submitted to the court on Thursday, the attorney general
  argued that the case was not urgent and plaintiffs did not have legal
  standing. The papers said: “The [constitution] empowers government to
  executive international agreements in the name of the crown.” Zakithi
  Sibandze, the national coordinator of Rural Women’s Assembly Eswatini, one of
  the plaintiff NGOs, said: “This agreement is unconstitutional because it
  should have been presented to and approved by our members of parliament. That
  clearly didn’t happen, and you could see our MPs were completely in the dark
  based on how they grilled the government about it.” She added: “The government
  assures us these individuals are in secure facilities, but that does not ease
  our fears. We have heard stories of criminals escaping from prison. We are not
  convinced.” Melusi Simelane of the Salc said: “We want the details of this
  deal … the prime minister and this government, they are withholding
  information, information that is very pertinent to our rights as citizens.”
  The International Organization for Migration, a UN agency, said it was
  discussing with the Eswatini government a request to provide the deportees
  with “post-arrival assistance”, without providing further details or whether
  it would grant the request.
