  Getting the shingles vaccine could lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke
  by as much as 20%, according to the first study of its kind. Shingles is a
  common condition affecting millions worldwide that causes a painful rash and
  can lead to serious problems such as deafness, long-lasting pain and
  blindness. It is more likely to cause serious problems in older age groups.
  Most countries tend to only recommend the vaccine to older people or
  immunosuppressed adults but the findings suggest it could have cardiovascular
  protective effects in adults as young as 18. The results from the study, the
  world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis, shows the jab is
  associated with a significant lower risk of cardiovascular events. Having the
  shingles jab was associated with an 18% lower risk of stroke or heart attack
  in adults 18 and above. There was a 16% reduction in risk of cardiovascular
  events in adults 50 or older. The data will be presented this weekend to
  thousands of cardiologists at the annual meeting of the European Society of
  Cardiology in Madrid, the world’s largest cardiology conference. Dr Charles
  Williams, the study’s author and global associate medical director at GSK,
  said: “We looked at the currently available evidence, and found that in this
  analysis, vaccination against herpes zoster was associated with a lower risk
  of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes. “Further research
  studies are now needed to find out whether this association can be attributed
  to an effect of herpes zoster vaccination.” The global systematic review was
  conducted using three scientific literature databases, and a meta analysis was
  conducted of phase 3 randomised controlled trials and observational studies
  assessing the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on cardiovascular events.
  The shingles jab is usually just taken once, and is typically administered in
  two doses, several months apart. In total, 19 studies were included in the
  review. Eight observational studies and one randomised controlled trial met
  the inclusion criteria for studying the impact of the jab on cardiovascular
  events. Vaccination is increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only
  against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular
  disease or events. Prof Filippo Crea, a cardiology professor at the Catholic
  University in Rome, who was not involved with the study, said: “These results
  support a growing body of evidence … which indicates that vaccinations reduce
  the risk of cardiovascular disease.” Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific
  and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, also not involved with
  the research, welcomed the findings but said further research was needed. He
  said: “There is great interest in studies suggesting the shingles vaccine may
  reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, although this analysis is largely
  based on observational studies, which cannot demonstrate cause and effect. “We
  know that shingles can cause inflammation in the body, and that inflammation
  is a culprit in many heart and circulatory conditions which can lead to heart
  attacks and strokes. “By preventing shingles, vaccination could therefore be
  protective. But far more research is needed, especially to understand the
  intriguing results in younger people. More evidence will be needed before the
  shingles vaccine can be recommended for a wider age group.” The findings came
  as NHS England said 300,000 more people would become eligible for the shingles
  jab from next week. People eligible from 1 September are those between 18 and
  49 with a severely weakened immune system. The NHS previously expanded
  eligibility to include people over 50 with a severely weakened immune system.
