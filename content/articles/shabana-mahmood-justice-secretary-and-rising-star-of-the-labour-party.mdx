  Shabana Mahmood knows what it is like to live in an area where crime feels out
  of control. While she was growing up in Small Heath in inner-city Birmingham
  in the 1980s and 90s, her father kept a cricket bat behind the till of the
  family shop to fend off would-be robbers. Three decades later, Mahmood is
  Labour’s justice secretary and lord chancellor, tasked with cutting crime at a
  time when public concern about it is rising. Though violent crime has fallen
  steadily over decades, recent increases in highly visible offences including
  shoplifting and snatch theft have contributed to a feeling of lawlessness and
  insecurity. Fanning the flames are politicians including Nigel Farage, the
  Reform UK leader, and Robert Jenrick, Mahmood’s Conservative counterpart, who
  have sought to draw a link between crime – particularly sexual assault – and
  immigration. For Mahmood, being the daughter of immigrants is central to her
  worldview about justice. “She feels very strongly that being British is a
  responsibility as well as a right,” a source close to her said. “She really
  does feel like it’s an affront when people who come here are afforded the
  welcome that she and her family were, but break the laws of the land.” Another
  politician shaped by his upbringing as the child of immigrant parents was
  Rishi Sunak, who felt strongly that it was an injustice for people to arrive
  illegally in Britain on small boats. Though their backgrounds and politics are
  very different, Mahmood and Sunak crossed paths at Oxford in the late 90s,
  with a teenage Sunak pledging his support for Mahmood when she stood for
  president of the Lincoln college student union. Last week, she received the
  surprise endorsement of another high-profile Tory: Michael Gove. Asked by the
  Politics Inside Out podcast to choose this government’s standout figure, he
  replied without hesitation: Shabana Mahmood. Mahmood is a politician with “a
  totally coherent worldview” who “embodies in some respects the Labour
  coalition”, he said. Mahmood has a growing number of admirers inside the
  Labour party, too. Having been a central figure in the Keir Starmer project
  from its early days, she is highly rated by No 10 and is thought of as one of
  its most effective ministers. A cabinet colleague said she “never wastes a
  word” in meetings, and recently warned that the government was still caught up
  in an opposition mindset and preoccupied with taking on the left instead of
  speaking to the concerns of the country more widely. She has also been a
  leading advocate for the UK to take a more pro-Palestinian stance, including
  on statehood. Those who have worked with Mahmood praise her political nous.
  This year, she emerged unscathed from a clash with Jenrick over new sentencing
  guidelines that would have made an offender’s ethnicity or faith a greater
  factor when deciding whether to jail them. She forced the Sentencing Council
  to back down and has ordered a review of its role. Early on, she also clashed
  with Richard Hermer, the attorney general, amid claims he was obstructing
  aspects of the government’s agenda. Colleagues say the pair get on well
  personally but come from different traditions. “Shabana believes, above all
  else, in parliamentary sovereignty and the value of our common law system.
  That makes her more of a reformer on things like the ECHR, [European
  convention on human rights]” a source close to her said. A former Conservative
  minister said: “She has much better political antennae than Lord Hermer – she
  recognises that the law ultimately has to command public confidence.” One
  source who has worked with her in a previous role said: “Her instincts are so
  well honed, it’s quite something. It’s a product of a number of things, she
  comes from a very political family and a very febrile political environment in
  Birmingham.” Her father was chair of the Birmingham Labour party and would
  host meetings for organisers – including Tom Watson, the future deputy Labour
  leader – in his living room over tea and samosas. Unusually among politicians,
  she has spoken about the importance of her faith. “It is the absolute core of
  my life,” she told Gove in an interview with the Spectator. “It’s where I draw
  my sense of duty and public service from. My understanding of Islam, how I’ve
  practised Islam my whole life has been about viewing life as a gift from God
  but it’s also a test from God.” “She is a very defined politician with a real
  instinct for the times,” said Charlie Falconer, who served as justice
  secretary under Tony Blair. “She is somebody who does understand politics in a
  profound way, and having been the campaign coordinator for Labour for quite
  some time she knows what has to be done in order to win elections.” Mahmood
  was elected to parliament in 2010 and within six months was promoted to a
  shadow frontbench role. In Starmer’s shadow cabinet, she spent more than two
  years as national campaign coordinator, a role in which she became
  indispensable to the strategy chief, Morgan McSweeney. She is credited for
  helping secure the narrow but fateful win in the 2021 Batley and Spen
  byelection, without which Starmer would probably have faced a leadership
  challenge that summer. In the justice department, she has arguably inherited
  the most difficult situation of any minister. In her first week, she announced
  the early release of thousands of criminals in response to the overcrowding
  crisis in English and Welsh prisons. “She knows she has got two things she has
  got to do in the justice department: get it out of this constant cycle of
  crisis and also use it to actually cut crime,” said the source close to her.
  She has set out plans for reforming the criminal justice system, which have
  ranged from chemical castration for serious sex offenders to allowing
  criminals to spend less time in prison and instead be rehabilitated in the
  community. She has taken inspiration from Texas, where there is a blend of
  hardline and progressive measures. “She’s not bowed down by an ideological
  approach to these things. She can blend some populism in with what are very
  strong values,” said the person who worked with her in the past. Mahmood’s
  experience of government so far has convinced her of the need to rewire the
  state and empower elected politicians over officials and quangos. “Shabana is
  starting to be seen particularly as a leader of ‘if we need to break things,
  we should break things’ … She has come to really believe in the depths of
  state failure,” one MP close to her said. In a speech in Strasbourg this
  summer, she announced that the UK would seek reform of the European convention
  on human rights amid concerns about it being cited to block the deportation of
  dangerous offenders. The justice secretary has a busy autumn in store,
  starting with plans to introduce a bill in September to deliver her sentencing
  reforms including shorter prison sentences for some offenders. Before the end
  of the year, she intends to set out the other half of her reform agenda to
  tackle the groaning backlog in crown courts, after a review by Brian Leveson
  recommended that some offences be tried without a jury. However she performs
  in government, by the time of the next election Mahmood may face her biggest
  challenge at home. Her majority in Birmingham Ladywood dropped from nearly
  30,000 in 2019 to 3,400 last year after a challenge from a pro-Gaza
  independent candidate. Zarah Sultana, the independent MP who is starting a
  party with Jeremy Corbyn, is said to have designs on the seat. Allies of
  Mahmood say that her challengers face an uphill struggle. “She is much more
  deeply embedded in her community than others who lost or came close to losing
  were,” the source close to her said. In parliament in recent months, Mahmood
  has hosted dinners with small groups of Labour MPs interested in the reforms
  she is planning. Some on the backbenches have begun to see her as a future
  leader. “If she ever put the hat in the ring, it would be because she wanted
  the debate to be rigorous and bold and she wanted to be the person who forced
  that kind of honesty,” the MP close to her said. “But it tends to be the case
  that the people who propagate that kind of message don’t win.”
