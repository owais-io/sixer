  Wildfires have devastated the western US and Canada this week, resulting in
  destruction, injury, evacuation and poor air quality. On Tuesday, several
  states – including Colorado, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and
  Connecticut – issued air quality health advisories, according to the National
  Weather Service. Wildfire smoke, a major source of air pollution, is linked to
  severe health issues including heart attacks, strokes and lung diseases like
  asthma. There is also a nascent body of research on their mental health
  effects, which is beginning to reveal connections that can help us better
  understand how these complex interactions impact our wellbeing, and inform
  potential solutions. How does wildfire smoke affect the brain? Air pollution
  affects our brain health and cognitive function. Researchers have found the
  fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution released by wildfires is even more
  toxic than air pollution from other sources. One possible reason is the high
  level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) mixed with various levels of
  other known neurotoxic particles that can be found in smoke, including heavy
  metals. These particles can reach the brain via the olfactory nerve and pass
  through the blood–brain barrier, or modulate the nervous system, leading to
  brain inflammation and oxidative stress. Can wildfire smoke affect cognitive
  function? Neuroinflammation caused by wildfire smoke increases the risk of
  developing Alzheimer’s, dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Recent research from
  the Universities of Washington and Pennsylvania found that the odds of a new
  dementia diagnosis increased about 21% for every 1 microgram increase in the
  concentration of wildfire particles a person inhales, compared with a 3%
  increased risk for every 3 microgram jump in non-wildfire particles.
  Additional research from the University of New Mexico suggests that sudden
  increases in air pollution, as occur during wildfires, create surges of
  inflammation in the hippocampus region of the brain, responsible for memory
  and learning. These can linger for over a month after exposure. That may
  explain why, in addition to several studies finding a correlation between
  smoke exposure and poorer concentration and decision making skills while
  playing digital games and sports, smoky days also appear linked to poorer
  academic performance. In a 2020 study, UC San Diego economist and researcher
  Josh Graff Zivin examined how smoky air affected students taking China’s
  national college entrance exam over a six year period. Graff Zivin
  specifically studied smoke created by routine, controlled agricultural fires,
  removing potential anxiety related to possible evacuations as a factor from
  the study. His team found that when there was a significant increase in fires
  upwind compared to downwind during the exam, students’ total scores dropped by
  0.6 points on average. This decrease in scores also slightly reduced students’
  likelihood of getting into top-tier universities. A US study from 2022
  estimated that smoke exposure in 2016 reduced students’ future earnings by
  nearly $1.7bn (or $111 per student). “We don’t exactly know what’s happening
  to the brain” during heavy smoke days, says Graff Zivin. “But we know it’s
  bad.” The cardiovascular effects of smoke inhalation may affect our body’s
  ability to properly oxygenate our brains. “Just having impaired lung function
  could lead to cognitive impairment,” he says. But more research is required to
  fully understand the extent to which smoky days affect cognitive performance.
  Nor do we yet fully understand the cumulative impact of being exposed to smoke
  for weeks or months each year, Graff Zivin adds. What’s the relationship
  between smoky days and depression? It’s not exactly clear how smoke may
  physiologically impact the brain in ways that contribute to feelings of
  depression, but researchers believe cognitive impairment – like that which
  Graff Zivin observed among test-taking students – can be a factor in low mood.
  Researchers also increasingly believe brain inflammation plays a role in
  producing depression, raising the possibility that brain inflammation
  triggered by wildfire smoke could contribute to mood disorders. The stress and
  trauma of a wildfire event can also affect mental health. UC San Diego School
  of Medicine neuroscientist Dr Jyoti Mishra studied people both directly and
  indirectly exposed to 2018’s Camp fire, one year after it tore through Butte
  county, California. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she found that those who faced
  significant personal loss or trauma during the fires exhibited the highest
  levels of PTSD, anxiety and depression. Yet even community members who were
  not directly impacted by the fire reported increased neurocognitive issues,
  and struggled with depression and anxiety. Can wildfires cause
  environment-related anxiety? Some of the dread people living close to
  wildfires feel is related to “seeing landscapes change, environments change,
  and worrying about both the present and the future,” says Dr Warren Dodd, an
  associate professor in the School of Public Health Sciences at the University
  of Waterloo. Dodd has interviewed residents of Canada’s Northwest Territories
  who experienced what was, in 2014, a record fire season. They reported
  feelings of anger, stress and hopelessness about the threats posed by climate
  change. In addition to the distress of witnessing one’s environment change
  rapidly – also known as solastalgia – the people Dodd interviewed reported
  that stopping their summertime outdoor and land-based activities to shelter
  indoors had negative consequences for their mental health. What can we do
  about the mental health effects of wildfires? Curtailing the physiological
  effects of wildfire smoke on our brains involves many of the same behaviors as
  protecting the rest of our bodies from air pollution: using an air purifier
  indoors, thoroughly cleaning living spaces to remove particulate matter that
  gets inside, wearing a mask outdoors and minimizing unnecessary time spent
  outside. When it comes to mitigating the psychological harms of smoky days,
  local authorities can spring into action. Making community resources available
  for free during wildfires is one way to help people alleviate some of the
  isolation and anxiety felt when sheltering indoors. For instance, Dodd notes
  that the city of Yellowknife waived fees for its indoor recreation center
  during the fire, allowing people to get some exercise and see their neighbors
  without having to be outside. Resilience is important for communities to focus
  on, says Mishra – not just after a climate disaster, but also preemptively.
  “When we studied the Camp fire folks, we found that there are certainly some
  traits, such as greater mindfulness and better physical activity that can
  contribute to a sense of resilience,” she says. But the strength of people’s
  family and social connections were also a significant factor in their
  resilience. People who “feel supported and like there’s a sense of community
  around you are best protected in terms of their mental health outcomes”, she
  says. A stronger sense of community can be an antidote for loneliness and a
  tool for climate resilience, Mishra notes. For those experiencing PTSD,
  therapy for underlying neurocognitive issues can assist with recovery. As
  ever, prevention is key: reducing greenhouse gas emissions can slow global
  warming and help curb forest fires and their devastating, complex
  consequences. Graff Zivin believes that governments must bear in mind the
  economic repercussions of diminished productivity and cognitive function, and
  invest more heavily in wildfire prevention and forest health. A healthy forest
  maintained with prescribed burns can lead to less intense wildfires, he says.
  “We rarely talk about the value of having healthy forests.”
