  By the numbers: the latest Ice and CBP data on arrests, detentions and
  deportations in the US
sectionName: US news

bodyText: >-
  Donald Trump campaigned on a platform of mass deportation. Since he took
  office, his administration has reshaped immigration enforcement across the
  country. The Guardian US, using data published every two weeks by US
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), is tracking the number of people
  the administration has arrested, detained and deported. Notes on the data Ice
  publishes detention statistics for the current fiscal year every two weeks.
  The Guardian US has been archiving each release of detention management
  statistics since January 2025 and received older releases from the Vera
  Institute for Justice. We calculated the number of people arrested, detained
  and deported during each reporting period by scraping data from each release
  and comparing the totals with previous releases. The data for Ice arrests
  comes from the ICE Initial Book-Ins by Arresting Agency and Month: FY2025
  table. Arrest figures may be an undercount because Ice reports only arrests
  that result in someone entering Ice detention. Detention totals come from the
  ICE Currently Detained by Criminality and Arresting Agency: FY2025 table.
  Deportations come from the ICE Removals: FY2025 table. The Guardian US did not
  visualize the first data release of FY2025. The first release of each year
  includes carryover data from the previous fiscal year and includes more than
  two weeks of arrests and deportations.
