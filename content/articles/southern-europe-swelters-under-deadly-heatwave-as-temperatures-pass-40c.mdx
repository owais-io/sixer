  Deadly heat of up to 44C is searing southern Europe, as scientists warn of a
  “molotov cocktail” of climatic conditions that is fuelling vast wildfires
  across the Mediterranean. In Italy, where temperatures of 40C are expected in
  Florence later this week, a four-year-old boy died of heatstroke, and a red
  alert warning was issued for seven major cities, including Bologna and
  Florence. The boy had been found unconscious in the family’s car in Sardinia
  and was airlifted to a Rome hospital several days ago but died on Monday of
  irreversible brain damage. France’s weather placed more than half the country
  under heatwave warnings on Monday morning, with 12 out of 96 administrative
  units on the mainland under the highest red alert, while Spain’s Aemet warned
  of “extreme danger” in Zaragoza and the Basque Country as it issued yellow and
  orange warnings for almost all the rest of the country. Both weather agencies
  forecast temperatures above 40C over the coming days and called for vigilance
  amid forecasts of “a very intense, even exceptional” heatwave in parts of the
  continent. The high temperatures have alarmed experts as firefighters struggle
  to contain destructive wildfires. In France, which brought its biggest fire
  since 1949 under control on Sunday, authorities reported that one person had
  died in the blaze, while 20 firefighters and five civilians had been injured.
  In the Balkans, Croatian officials praised the “superhuman” efforts of
  firefighters as they put out a large fire near Split on Monday, while Serbian
  meteorologists warned of “extreme conditions” for fires to develop amid
  temperatures of up to 40C. Wildfires in Albania and Montenegro also forced
  people to flee their homes, according to local media reports. In Spain, fires
  that broke out in León and Zamora on Sunday forced more than 1,000 people to
  flee their homes, while large fires continued to burn in Galicia. Cristina
  Santín Nuño, a fire scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, said
  the large number of blazes was “to be expected” after a wet spring that helped
  plants grow was followed by extreme heat, strong winds and long periods
  without rain. “If we add to this the relatively easy possibility that a spark
  can ignite a fire somewhere … we have all the ingredients for the ‘molotov
  cocktail’ we’re seeing right now,” she said. French forecasters said heat
  records were likely to be broken on Monday and Tuesday as temperatures pass
  42C in the south-west. Temperatures hit a record high of 41.4C in the village
  of Tourbes, near Béziers, at the weekend. In Spain, temperatures on Monday
  were expected to rise further in the Ebro basin, the southern and eastern
  thirds of the Iberian peninsula, and the eastern Cantabrian Sea. They were
  forecast to fall in the north-west, particularly in Galicia. The weather
  agency said it expected heat of 37-39C across the interior of the Iberian
  peninsula on Monday, with maximum temperatures above 40C in the interior of
  the Basque Country and highs that could reach above 44C in the lower
  Guadalquivir. Jesús Santiago Notario del Pino, a soil scientist at the
  University of La Laguna, said conditions of “extreme and prolonged heat” had
  primed the large number of fires across the country by drying out fuel. He
  added: “Areas in the centre and north-west, theoretically less prone to severe
  fires – compared with the Mediterranean coast, for example – are burning. This
  is striking to me.” The world has warmed by about 1.4C because of fossil fuel
  pollution, which forms a heat-trapping blanket around the Earth, and the
  destruction of nature, which sucks carbon dioxide from the air. In Europe,
  which has warmed nearly twice as fast as the global average, a warm and dry
  air mass hanging over much of the Iberian peninsula and France has coincided
  with high levels of summer sunshine that have pushed temperatures even higher.
  In addition to the risk to humans from flames and smoke, the wildfires in
  Spain have also threatened Las Médulas world heritage site in El Bierzo.
  “Personally, today is a sad day for me,” said Santín Nuño, who is from El
  Bierzo. “Las Médulas has burned there, a beautiful spot with centuries-old
  chestnut trees and a Unesco world heritage site.” She added: “In Spain, we’re
  facing a new reality of forest fires because our landscapes have changed a lot
  in recent decades – there’s more vegetation susceptible to burning – and now,
  climate change is creating more opportunities for these landscapes to burn
  more widely, intensely, and dangerously.”
