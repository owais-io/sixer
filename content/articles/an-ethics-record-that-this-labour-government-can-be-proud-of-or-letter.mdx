  Re your editorial (The Guardian view on standards in politics: a golden reform
  opportunity squandered, 25 July), before being elected to parliament for the
  first time last year, I dedicated nearly 15 years of my life to tackling
  bribery and corruption. And I am pleased that the government is implementing
  its manifesto commitments to improve standards. Let us not forget the steady
  work of Margaret Hodge, who is progressing a comprehensive, cross-government
  anti-corruption strategy to be published later this year, and the Covid
  counter-fraud commissioner, Tom Hayhoe, whose work is so vital to restoring
  trust in government. And let us not forget what the government has already
  committed to in its first 12 months: replacing the Advisory Committee on
  Business Appointments, increasing the frequency of ministerial hospitality
  disclosures, scrapping hereditary peers, votes at 16, rolling out automatic
  voter registration, tightening up political party financing and empowering the
  Electoral Commission. That’s a track record to be proud of and a clear change
  of course from the political indifference to ethics, integrity and democratic
  participation exhibited by recent Conservative governments. Is there more to
  be done? Yes, but talk of squandering opportunities is far wide of the mark.
