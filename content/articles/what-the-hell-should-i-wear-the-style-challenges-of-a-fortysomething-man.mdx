  In September I will turn 44, the supposed first iceberg of ageing. As my own
  personal A23a approaches, I find myself, when it comes to how to get dressed
  at least, not older and wiser but but more adrift than ever. It’s not
  necessarily for want of effort. A while ago I tried on a pair of wide
  trousers: the big blocky sort that have become increasingly fashionable. I
  hadn’t worn anything like them before and wasn’t convinced, but was feeling
  bored with my own wardrobe. When I modelled them in the shop for my wife, she
  reacted instantly. I couldn’t pull them off, she said. You’re not an art or
  fashion person, was the implication. She was right; her advice tends to be
  sound. As a man, when you push into your 40s it becomes harder to keep up with
  every new trend and perhaps there comes a point at which maybe you shouldn’t.
  But you might not want to totally give up either. You don’t want to seem like
  the old guy finally catching up with a new trend just as the last helicopter
  pulls out of Saigon. Equally it can be mortifying attempting to grab on to
  every incoming style. And so like Clinton or Blair, you scramble desperately
  for a sartorial third way. Or something that sits with relative comfort as the
  waistline expands – the middle ground. It always comes with a nagging fear
  that it doesn’t look quite right. There are many greater problems in life, and
  yet I find myself at home, in the shop, in a changing room wondering: what the
  hell should I wear anymore? Perhaps this offers a way to avoid the bigger
  questions. Recently a funny Instagram/TikTok sketch did the rounds. It was a
  parody of the genre of street interview where one gurning idiot asks another
  gurning idiot to rank and recommend things. Two men are desperately trying to
  keep up with the latest in London cool until for one of them the penny drops.
  “What am I doing? This is not me,” he says. “None of this is me and I just
  feel so tired, all the time.” He gestures at the trendy-by-numbers outfit he’s
  wearing, bumbag, tube socks and all. “I’m just stuck in this endless stasis of
  cultural peacocking. I’m a fucking mannequin for people to hang stuff on.” He
  lands on the crux of it: “I just feel like, what really scares me is like this
  idea of what’s cool is going to change again, and I’m just not going to have
  the energy to keep up with that.” Many of us will have felt a piercing element
  of truth watching this, and there is a more mundane aspect too. Updating your
  wardrobe requires time, effort and money – and once you’ve done it, things may
  have changed again. Not to mention that growing sense that we should all be
  buying less and reusing more anyway. And so I find myself, along with many men
  of my age, a little dazed and confused in my search for clothes that suit the
  time – and me. Some of the certainties of how you dressed in your 20s and 30s
  start to slip away. Can I still wear Air Max or Asics? Are white trainers now
  the preserve of Gianni Infantino? Does a band tee still look OK? Why does that
  sweatshirt make me look like a teenager with grey hair? Should I wear my jeans
  this wide, or that narrow? Trousers feel foundational to this quandary; it’s
  easy to make a misstep almost without realising. It feels like a style version
  of a line uttered in Rounders, the late 90s indie film about poker: “If you
  can’t spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you ARE the
  sucker.” Trousers have been on a journey of epic proportions in the last 30
  years: in the late 90s, wide and bootcut styles were common. In the 2000s,
  spurred by the likes of designer Hedi Slimane and the Strokes, jeans got ever
  slimmer. Through the 2000s and 2010s, various iterations of slim-fitting
  trousers became the norm until tight trousers reached the point of absurdity,
  as evinced by the 2019 viral photo of four Birmingham lads on a night out,
  their jeans so welded to their skin you could almost see the outlines of their
  leg tattoos. Gradually, spurred by the fashion-forward likes of Vetements and
  Supreme in the mid 2010s, and then suddenly, things changed – ballooning in
  the exact opposite direction. Now bigger, wider styles abound. Even those
  Birmingham boys got on board. I hopped on the bandwagon around 2020, with some
  jeans from Weekday in a looser fit than anything I’d worn in the previous
  decade. And yet someone more style conscious than me is already charting the
  way back to tighter jeans. See what I mean? If men of a certain age have
  always suffered something of an identity crisis when it comes to clothes, the
  accelerated trend cycle has made things a lot worse. It’s difficult to chart a
  course through these paths, which continually cross and circle back on each
  other at ever greater speed. “My husband’s a similar age and says a similar
  thing,” Beth Pettet, head of menswear at John Lewis, tells me reassuringly.
  “There’s so much information out there, there’s so much imagery, there’s so
  much data, there’s so many points at which the consumer can access fashion in
  a way that they couldn’t previously that it can be overwhelming.” Plus, she
  thinks it’s “not so much about a pure trend being filtered down, as it was
  previously. The customer has greater choice, but with that, they can then
  struggle to navigate.” Perhaps as a result of this wider and somewhat
  relentless choice, Pettet believes mainstream menswear is getting more
  adventurous, if in a gentle way: “There is a new mood of experimentation and
  discovery,” even, she says, among core John Lewis customers, who are hardly
  Colman Domingo. This shift has been catalysed by some traditional big name
  brands, be it Levi’s or Ralph Lauren, offering a bit more variety in size and
  shape and colour – a rubber stamp that provides a permission slip of sorts.
  Beyond John Lewis, the likes of the aforementioned Domingo, Andrew Scott and
  Daniel Craig have been taking menswear for the over-40s in creative directions
  on the global stage. Seth Rogen, in recent years, has given a rather
  unexpected template for how to dress well and with personality as a 40-plus
  man, offering not so much a permission slip as, perhaps, a hypothesis of that
  third way. For some this will be a blessing, though I remain wary. If the
  choice is broader and the scope for sartorial freedom greater, so too is the
  possibility of getting it all wrong. Excesses of bright colours and patterns
  on ageing men can bring some bad associations, namely Chris Martin leaping
  around the stage looking like a CBeebies presenter on a stadium tour. Or the
  soft-cancelled Arcade Fire frontman, Win Butler, whose style has eloquently
  been described as “drug toddler”. Helpfully for me, the fashion academic and
  writer Dal Chodha, who teaches at Central Saint Martins, is not convinced
  things have truly become more adventurous – granted, he’s a little more
  saturnine about it. He thinks that, aside from some creative industries that
  in theory allow more expressive dressing, most people still work in jobs that
  herd them into conservative modes of clothing. In general, people remain wary
  of standing out. “We love to believe that things have changed,” says Chodha,
  “but many of us are not doing anything. We’re just talking to each other [in
  the fashion industry] about how fab someone looks in a pair of tiny silk
  shorts.” Sure, I do think Paul Mescal looks fab in tiny shorts (even if such
  GAA shorts bring back disappointing memories of my very average hurling and
  Gaelic football-playing days as a kid in Dublin circa 1992) – but that doesn’t
  necessarily help me. So how should I approach getting dressed as a nearly
  44-year-old man? Chodha says many people gravitate to the classics. “It’s the
  501 cut jean, in a very good dark denim.” This has been the route I have taken
  recently: after a long time bouncing around between denim brands, I landed at
  the safe harbour of classic 501s in black and blue, straight fit. From here on
  (I assure myself), it’s a straight-down-the-line, comfortable fit that suits
  an average bloke in his 40s. Admittedly there is a risk of looking like Top
  Gear-era Jeremy Clarkson, but we beat on. Chodha continues with his capsule
  wardrobe list: “It’s [with] a good chore jacket that you can have some fun
  with colours. It looks half-smart and half-casual. It’s a good quality
  T-shirt, a strong pair of glasses. It’s Carhartt. These kinds of brands that
  are workwear. And wedded to a certain type of manliness; we can’t
  underestimate that. Carhartt, Levi’s, some of the sportswear brands. They’re
  about a certain kind of virility, testosterone.” This kind of manly workwear
  has, says Chodha, “become the blueprint for man dressing. And unless the high
  street gets braver and queerer, it will carry on like that.” I like a chore
  coat as much as the next fella and I gravitate to plain white or black
  T-shirts; the Oxford shirt button-down staple, a reliable polo shirt. But
  surely I can’t just stick to clothes that could be filed under the broad
  spectrum of high street basics (Uniqlo, Muji), Scandinavian chain minimalism
  (Cos, Arket) and tasteful mid-range menswear (YMC, Folk) without feeling quite
  generic and identikit? I’m forever haunted by a joke in the Onion, circa 2006,
  which offers up a cover of “The Onion Style Magazine” accompanied by a
  schlubby and pale white man walking down a catwalk in blue jeans and a white
  T-shirt, under the headline “Heterosexual Men’s Fashion”. Chodha agrees. “My
  issue with all of those brands, and largely what’s happened to the British
  high street, is that there’s very few kinks,” he says. There’s very few
  moments where something’s a little bit off, a little bit more experimental.
  It’s this neutralisation, this neutral palette, neutral cuts – that’s not
  really allowed men to express themselves. And I think that’s a real shame.”
  Recently a friend told me he was looking for all his shirts in secondhand
  shops. Maybe more secondhand, replete with some personality, is the answer –
  it would certainly help my growing unease at buying new. “I only ever want to
  wear loose clothes from now on,” he added; the fit of secondhand is often less
  bodycon/muscle-tight. I had arrived at a similar realisation: a sort of
  relaxed-fit, semi-casualness. Visually Stephen Malkmus is a good model:
  especially in recent years on Pavement comeback tours. In a straight blue jean
  or khaki trousers and a jacket, in all manner of polo shirts and old tennis
  shirts, or rolled sleeve shirts. In shorts even. He manages to carry it all
  off – with the same just-so insouciance that characterises his music. It helps
  that he is tall and lanky. Clothes tend to sit well on him. If, like me, you
  don’t yet have things sussed like the Malkmuses of the world, don’t fret.
  “It’s an anxiety that everybody at some point has to face,” says Chodha. “I
  think fashion has always been a very pertinent example of a space where people
  feel like they are constantly not getting it right.” We’re all, ultimately,
  just floating in the sea, hoping for the best as we get dressed in the
  morning. Perhaps especially men of a certain age.
