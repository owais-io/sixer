  Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he is re-establishing the presidential
  fitness test, a way of assessing the fitness level of American students. The
  test was administered in public middle and high schools in the United States
  from 1966 to 2013, when the Obama administration replaced it with the
  presidential youth fitness program – a similar physical assessment program,
  but with more focus on health education. The health secretary, Robert F
  Kennedy Jr – vaccine skeptic and key figure in the “Make America Healthy
  Again” movement – will be in charge of administering the test. In a statement
  reported by the AP, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said
  the president “wants to ensure America’s future generations are strong,
  healthy, and successful” and that young Americans “have the opportunity to
  emphasize health, active lifestyles – creating a culture of strength and
  excellence for years to come”. Below, what you need to know about the
  presidential fitness test. What is the test? Initiated by Dwight D Eisenhower
  in 1956, the test changed over the years, but generally consisted of five
  parts: a one-mile run, a shuttle run (moving as quickly as possible back and
  forth between two points), pull-ups or push-ups, sit-ups and the sit-and-reach
  (sitting on the ground with your legs outstretched and seeing how far down
  your legs your hands can reach). According to the Harvard Health blog, the aim
  of the test was to “assess cardiovascular fitness, upper-body and core
  strength, endurance, flexibility, and agility”. Why did the government start
  testing children’s fitness? The test derives from the Kraus-Weber test for
  muscular fitness, an assessment developed by Dr Hans Kraus and Dr Sonja Weber.
  The test was administered to thousands of students across the US and Europe.
  Researchers found that European students performed significantly better than
  their American counterparts: 57.9% of US students failed at least one of the
  test’s six exercises, compared with only 8.7% of European students. According
  to a 1955 Sports Illustrated article, when Kraus presented his findings at the
  White House, President Eisenhower declared the problem “a serious one”. The
  president seemed less worried about children’s health and wellbeing than he
  did their combat preparedness. According to the Department of Health and Human
  Service’s 50th anniversary booklet about the test, “his chief concern seemed
  to be the vulnerability to the red army”. “Our growing softness, our
  increasing lack of physical fitness, is a menace to our security,” Eisenhower
  said. Did the presidential fitness test make kids healthier? It doesn’t seem
  so. A 2025 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found
  that from 2007 to 2023, trends had “significantly worsened” for “child
  mortality; chronic physical, developmental and mental health conditions;
  obesity; sleep health; early puberty; limitations in activity; and physical
  and emotional symptoms”. And when it comes to competition with Europe, the US
  is faring even worse than it did before. Dr Christopher Forrest, one of the
  study’s authors, told NPR that back in the 1960s, “the chance that a child was
  going to die in the United States was the same as European nations”. But from
  2010 to 2023, “kids in the United States were 80% more likely to die”, than
  those in Europe.
