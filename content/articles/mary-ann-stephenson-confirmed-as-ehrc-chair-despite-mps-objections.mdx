  Mary-Ann Stephenson has been confirmed as the new chair of the equalities
  watchdog, after the government overruled the objections of parliament’s
  equalities committee over her suitability for the job. Stephenson, the chair
  of the Women’s Budget Group, will take on the role at the Equality and Human
  Rights Commission (EHRC) in December. It includes responsibility for
  implementing guidance about transgender rights after the supreme court
  judgment on the definition of a woman. The women and equalities committee and
  the joint committee on human rights had together raised objections about the
  appointment, saying her experience was not sufficient in the area of protected
  characteristics such as race and disability. The committees, chaired by Sarah
  Owen and David Alton, had written to the equalities minister Bridget
  Phillipson saying: “It is clear that Dr Stephenson has extensive academic
  credibility in the field of women’s rights and has an important contribution
  to make to public life. “However, it is with regret that we do not feel we can
  endorse her appointment to the role at this time. Our reasons relate to our
  concerns about vision and leadership, about breadth of expertise across the
  wide remit of the EHRC, and about rebuilding trust.” Stephenson was announced
  as the UK government’s preferred candidate in June and gave evidence before
  the committees in July. Following her appointment, Stephenson said it was a
  “great honour to be appointed as the new chair of the Equality and Human
  Rights Commission at such a critical time”. “I have spent over 30 years
  building my career across the equality and human rights sector and I am
  delighted to have the opportunity to bring my insight and experience to lead
  the EHRC with compassion, honesty and dedication,” she said. “I look forward
  to working with the government and all stakeholders alongside my new
  colleagues at the EHRC to uphold equality and human rights and ensure that
  everyone is treated with respect and dignity.” Stephenson will replace Kishwer
  Falkner in the job of chair. The EHRC is drawing up an updated code of
  practice on how public bodies should react to April’s court decision that
  “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman. It is intended
  to set out to businesses and those running public spaces how the ruling
  affects single-sex spaces such as toilets and changing rooms, building on
  initial advice issued soon after the ruling. The guidance will attempt to
  navigate a path for how organisations can provide single-sex and
  gender-neutral spaces such as toilets, changing rooms and associations. In
  April, the EHRC released interim, non-statutory advice about how to interpret
  the ruling, which set out that transgender people should not be allowed to use
  toilets of the gender they live as. There are now attempts at a judicial
  review of the EHRC guidance by the Good Law Project and others.
