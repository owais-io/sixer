  This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the
  day. We will be back at it on Wednesday. In the meantime, here are the latest
  developments: Donald Trump ended a visit to his golf resorts in Scotland,
  where he once again repeated his bizarre boast that he “predicted” the result
  of the 2016 Brexit referendum during a visit to the courses that summer which,
  in fact, began the day after the vote Trump told reporters on Air Force One
  that he broke with Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender he socialized with
  for more than a decade, after he “stole” young, female spa attendants away
  from Mar-a-Lago, including Virginia Giuffre, who became one of Epstein’s most
  prominent accusers. A Republican-led congressional committee rejected the
  convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell’s demand that she be granted
  immunity before agreeing to testify about Epstein to Congress. Trump expressed
  sympathy for “kids that are starving” in Gaza, but repeated the debunked
  Israeli talking point that Hamas is to stealing aid, and endorsed the chaotic
  system of aid distribution run by Israel with US support that has cost 1,000
  Palestinians their lives. The Senate voted 50-49 to confirm Emil Bove, a
  former defense attorney for Trump to a lifetime seat on a federal appeals
  court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring court
  orders. The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Emil Bove, a top justice department
  official and former defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a
  federal appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for
  ignoring court orders. The vote broke nearly along party lines, with 50
  Republican senators voting for his confirmation to a seat on the third circuit
  court of appeals overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US
  Virgin Islands. All Democrats opposed his nomination along with Republican
  senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Tennessee senator Bill Hagerty
  missed the vote. Bove’s nomination for the lifetime position has faced
  strident opposition from Democrats, after Erez Reuveni, a former justice
  department official who was fired from his post, alleged that during his time
  at the justice department, Bove told lawyers that they “would need to consider
  telling the courts ‘fuck you’ and ignore any such court order” blocking
  efforts to remove immigrants to El Salvador. In testimony before the committee
  last month, Bove denied the accusation, and Reuveni later provided text
  messages that supported his claim. US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has
  privately discussed the idea of resigning so he can run for governor next year
  in Tennessee, NBC News reports, citing “two people who have spoken directly
  with him about it.” The people who have spoken with Hegseth said he has
  specifically mentioned a possible campaign for governor in Tennessee, where he
  lives. The state has an open race for governor next year, though there are
  eligibility requirements for candidates that Hegseth might not meet.
  Ultimately, both sources said, it was unclear after their conversations with
  Hegseth whether he would take the leap. But they both said he has contemplated
  it. The network also reported a denial from Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief
  spokesman who said in a statement: “Fake news NBC is so desperate for
  attention, they are shopping around a made up story… again. Only two options
  exist: either the ‘sources’ are imaginary or these reporters are getting
  punked. Secretary Hegseth’s focus remains solely on serving under President
  Trump and advancing the America First mission at the Department of Defense.”
  Donald Trump has arrived back in Washington after a long weekend at his golf
  resorts in Scotland and the White House has started to post selected clips
  from his remarks to reporters on Air Force One this afternoon. In one clip
  posted on social media by an official White House account, Trump was asked
  about the images from Gaza of starving children. “I think everybody — unless
  they’re pretty coldhearted or, worse than that, nuts — there’s nothing you can
  say other than ‘it’s terrible’ when you see… kids that are starving. And you
  see the mothers, they love them so much and there’s just nothing they seem to
  be able to do”, Trump said. “They got to get them food, and we’re going to get
  them food.” Earlier in the informal news conference, however, Trump had
  suggested that the blame lies not with Israel, the occupying power that has
  cut off humanitarian aid deliveries to the besieged Palestinian territory for
  months, but Hamas. “I think Israel wants to do it, actually”, Trump said to a
  reporter who asked if Israel could be relied on to provide aid to the starving
  population. “I can tell you that they want to do it. They don’t want Hamas
  stealing the money or stealing the food, and that’s what they’ve been doing.”
  International aid groups have said for months that there is no evidence that
  Hamas is stealing aid intended for the civilian population of Gaza, and on
  Saturday, the New York Times reported that Israel’s military “never found
  proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from
  the United Nations”. Trump also told reporters that he was confident that
  Israel “can do a good job” of overseeing the distribution of food in the Gaza
  Strip. “They want to preside over the food centers to make sure the
  distribution is proper”, an apparent endorsement of the chaotic and deadly
  system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a collaboration between
  Israel’s military and US private contractors, which has led to the killing of
  more than 1,000 Palestinians since May. Trump also told reporters that he has
  not yet given up on his scheme to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip of its
  Palestinian population, the majority of whom were previously displaced from
  what is now Israel. “It’s a concept that some people fell in love with and
  some people don’t. We really have to see how it all works out before we do
  that”, Trump said. “You could do something spectacular, but that’s a different
  concept. You could also probably do it if you let some, some are leaving
  automatically, some would like to leave, I think many would like to leave if
  they were given an alternative”. “But certainly that was a concept that was
  really embraced by a lot of people”, the president claimed, “but also some
  people didn’t like it.” A Republican-led congressional committee rejected the
  convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell’s demand that she be granted
  immunity before agreeing to testify about the crimes of the late sex offender
  Jeffrey Epstein to Congress. Maxwell, who was convicted in federal court in
  New York in 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse multiple minor girls over
  the course of a decade, is serving a 20-year sentence in Florida. Amid the
  uproar over the Trump administration’s decision not to release documents from
  the federal investigation into Epstein, who socialized with Donald Trump for
  more than a decade, Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify privately to the House
  oversight committee. The committee wants to depose Maxwell, Epstein’s former
  girlfriend, on 11 August 11 at the federal prison where she is being held in
  Tallahassee. But Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, wrote to the committee’s
  chair, Republican congressman James Comer, that “Ms Maxwell cannot risk
  further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal
  immunity”. Comer’s spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement: “The
  oversight committee will respond to Ms Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will
  not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.” Markus, who
  has suggested that Maxwell might ask Trump for a pardon, is also asking the
  supreme court to overturn Maxwell’s conviction, on the grounds that a
  non-prosecution agreement a federal prosecutor in Florida offered Epstein in
  2008 should have barred the later prosecution of Maxwell in New York in 2020.
  Her lawyer also told Comer that his client would only agree to testify if the
  deposition was conducted somewhere other than the prison and if she is
  provided with the committee’s questions in advance. Congresswoman Summer Lee,
  a Pennsylvania Democrat who has been outspoken in her criticism of Israel’s
  assault on Gaza, condemned the mistreatment of the American labor activist
  Chris Smalls by Israeli soldiers after they raided the Handala, an aid ship
  that attempted to reach Gaza as part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. “Chris
  Smalls—a Black American labor leader—was trying to feed Palestinians being
  starved in Gaza. The IDF detained and beat him for it”, the progressive
  lawmaker commented on Instagram. “This assault must not go unnoticed and he
  must be freed immediately. Israel must be held to account. Let aid through.
  End the genocide.” As our colleague Adria Walker reports, the Freedom Flotilla
  Coalition, a grassroots international collective that has worked to end
  Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2010, said Smalls “was physically assaulted by
  seven uniformed individuals” who “choked him and kicked him in the legs,
  leaving visible signs of violence on his neck and back”. Read Adria’s report
  here: Experts on Tuesday urged California governor Gavin Newsom to drop his
  “tit-for-tat redistricting” threat in response to a Republican plan to pick up
  congressional seats in Texas. “You can’t fight gerrymandering with more
  gerrymandering,” Patricia Sinay, a commissioner for the California Citizens
  Redistricting Commission, said on a call organized by the watchdog group
  Common Cause. “It is a short sighted plan.” California Democrats say they are
  prepared to redraw the state’s 52 congressional districts in a longshot and
  controversial effort to pick up Democratic seats. Newsom, seen as a likely
  presidential candidate in 2028, has threatened to redraw the state’s 52
  congressional districts – a longshot bid to offset Republican gains in Texas
  with Democratic gains in California. Texas is considering mid-year
  redistricting at the urging of Donald Trump, who is angling to stave off
  losses in the Congressional midterm elections next year. Voter backlash at the
  polls could cost Republicans their House majority, and seriously blunt his
  agenda. While some partisans are cheering the efforts – especially Democrats
  hungry to see their elected officials take a tough stand in political fights
  with Republicans – experts warn that it’s not the “port in the storm” they are
  seeking. “Rolling back independent redistricting is bad policy. It’s also a
  waste of time,” said Emily Eby French, Texas policy director of Common Cause.
  “Come on down to Texas governor Newsom. We’ll show you how to fight the bad
  stuff without sacrificing the good stuff.” Dan Vicuña, a senior policy
  director for voting and fair representation at Common Cause, said the group
  was ready to challenge any attempt by California – or any state - to override
  its independent redistricting commission. “Although this is a very troubling
  and dangerous moment, one thing that’s useful is that it clarifies what this
  issue is about,” Vicuña said. “When we see politicians of both major parties
  willing to manipulate the process, manipulate voting districts, gerrymander at
  will, it’s a helpful reminder that this is, in fact, not a Democrat versus
  Republican issue. This is the politicians versus the people issue.” Donald
  Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he broke with Jeffrey Epstein, the
  late sex offender he socialized with for more than a decade, after he hired
  young, female spa attendants away from Mar-a-Lago, including Virginia Giuffre,
  who became one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers. Trump was asked to
  elaborate on his claim, on Monday in Scotland, that he kicked Epstein out of
  his club “because he did something that was inappropriate”, specifically “he
  stole people that worked for me”. On the flight back to Washington from
  Scotland on Tuesday, one reporter asked Trump if “the workers that were taken
  from you, were some of them young women?” Trump replied: “The answer is yes;
  they were. People that worked in the spa”. Another reporter then asked if
  Trump one of the people he was referring to was Giuffre, who said in a legal
  complaint that she was hired away from the Mar-a-Lago spa by Epstein’s
  accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was 16. Giuffre, who died this
  year, alleged in her complaint that she was first abused by Epstein and
  Maxwell together, and then “lent out to other powerful men”, including Prince
  Andrew. Trump replied: “I think so, I think that was one of the people, yeah.
  He stole her”. Senior White House aides have repeatedly suggested in recent
  weeks that Trump broke with Epstein around 2004, and expelled him from the
  Mar-a-Lago club for inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature. The president’s
  account of the break being motivated by pique at having his employees poached
  by his friend cast the break in a different light. His claim that one of those
  employees was the 16-year-old Virginia Giuffre also complicates the timeline.
  Giuffre was hired away from Mar-a-Lago in 2000, but two years later, Trump
  spoke highly of Epstein to a reporter, and made a point of his friend’s taste
  for young women. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy”, Trump told New
  York magazine in late 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said
  that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the
  younger side.” Sarah Blaskey, a Miami Herald investigative reporter, also
  pointed out in her 2020 book on Mar-a-Lago that Epstein remained on the
  membership rolls of Mar-a-Lago until October 2007, more than a year after he
  was first arrested and charged with soliciting prostitution from a minor. As
  Israel’s war in Gaza nears its two-year mark, and as horrifying images of
  starving people and utter devastation flood social media, cracks seem to be
  emerging in the American right’s typically iron-clad support for Israel.
  Marjorie Taylor Greene became the first Republican member of Congress to call
  Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide, while Steve Bannon, Trump’s influential
  former adviser, told Politico: “It seems that for the under-30-year-old Maga
  base, Israel has almost no support, and Netanyahu’s attempt to save himself
  politically by dragging America in deeper to another Middle East war has
  turned off a large swath of older Maga diehards. Now President Trump’s public
  repudiation of one of the central tenants of Bibi’s Gaza strategy - ‘starving’
  Palestinians - will only hasten a collapse of support.” Indeed support for
  Israel’s military action in Gaza has declined substantially among US adults,
  with only about a third approving, according to a new Gallup poll, which also
  found that about half of US adults now have an unfavorable view of Israel’s
  prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the most negative rating he has received.
  On Palestine, Trump said he and UK prime minister Keir Starmer did not discuss
  Britain’s plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless
  Israel holds to a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution. “We never did
  discuss it,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One. Ghislaine Maxwell
  has offered to testify before Congress but has asked lawmakers to give her
  immunity, along with other major conditions, according to a list of demands
  sent to the House oversight committee by her attorneys, seen by CNN. If the
  demands cannot be met, her attorneys said: “Maxwell will have no choice but to
  invoke her fifth amendment rights” (the right to remain silent). An oversight
  committee spokesperson rejected the idea of giving Maxwell immunity, telling
  CNN: “The oversight committee will respond to Ms. Maxwell’s attorney soon, but
  it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.”
  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor earlier to call
  on the FBI to undertake a counterintelligence threat assessment of Donald
  Trump’s Epstein connections. He highlighted the need to examine whether
  foreign countries might have tried to access the Epstein files and possibly
  exploit the information as leverage over the president. New York governor
  Kathy Hochul called for Congress to pass a national assault weapons ban
  following yesterday’s shooting in Manhattan which killed four people (and the
  shooter, who killed himself). “New York has some of the strongest gun laws in
  the nation ... But our laws only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a
  state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder,”
  Hochul said. Police are investigating whether the gunman was targeting the
  National Football League. In a note, the suspect, who appeared to have driven
  from Las Vegas to New York City over three days, appeared to blame the NFL for
  a brain injury. He claimed he suffered from CTE – the degenerative brain
  disease that has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma
  common in contact sports like football – and said his brain should be studied
  after he died. A preliminary investigation found that he took the wrong
  elevator, ending up on the wrong floor when he opened fire in the 345 Park
  Avenue building, which houses the NFL headquarters. Trump said he would start
  imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia “ten days from today” if Moscow
  did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The US president, who
  first announced yesterday that he was cutting his initial 50-day deadline for
  action from Moscow, said he had not heard a response from Russia. Trump said
  the Wall Street Journal and its billionaire owner Rupert Murdoch want to
  settle the president’s defamation lawsuit against the newspaper. On 18 July,
  Trump promptly sued the WSJ and its owners, including Murdoch, over a story
  alleging that Trump’s name was on a “lewd” birthday message for the convicted
  sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, that included a sexually suggestive drawing and
  a reference to shared secrets. “They want to settle it,” Trump said, adding,
  “when I get treated unfairly, I do things about it.” Trump’s lawsuit called
  the alleged letter “fake” and said the Journal published its article to harm
  his reputation. In a court filing yesterday, Trump asked a US court to order a
  swift deposition for Murdoch. The Department of Justice asked several large
  California counties to provide detailed personal information of non-citizens
  who got on to the state voter rolls, the Guardian has learned, in an unusual
  request that comes as the Trump administration has asked about a dozen states
  to provide wide swaths of information about voters and election practices.
  Support for Israel’s military action in Gaza has declined substantially among
  US adults, with only about a third approving, according to a new Gallup poll —
  a drop from the beginning of the war with Hamas, when about half of Americans
  approved of Israel’s operation. The new polling also found that about half of
  US adults now have an unfavorable view of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin
  Netanyahu, the most negative rating he has received since he was first
  included in Gallup polling in 1997. The poll was conducted from 7-21 July,
  while reports of starvation in Gaza led to international criticism of Israel’s
  decision to restrict food aid but before Donald Trump expressed concern over
  the worsening humanitarian situation. The findings underscore the Israeli
  government’s dramatic loss of support within America. But not everyone is
  shifting — instead, the war has become more politically polarizing. The rising
  disapproval is driven by Democrats and independents, who are much less likely
  to approve of Israel’s actions than they were in November 2023, weeks after
  Hamas’ 7 October attacks. Republicans, on the other hand, remain largely
  supportive of both Israel’s military actions and Netanyahu (though cracks are
  indeed emerging in the American right’s typically iron-clad support for the
  state of Israel). The new poll finds that about 6 in 10 US adults disapprove
  of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza, up from 45% in November 2023.
  Support for the war has been dwindling in Gallup’s polling for some time. In
  March 2024, about half of US adults disapproved of Israel’s military action in
  Gaza, which fell slightly as the year wore on. In a new low, only 8% of
  Democrats and one-quarter of independents say they now approve of Israel’s
  military campaign. Young adults are also much more likely to disapprove of
  Israel’s actions. Only about 1 in 10 adults under age 35 say they approve of
  Israel’s military choices in Gaza, compared with about half of those who are
  55 or older. Views of Netanyahu have also grown less favorable over the past
  few years, with more viewing him negatively than positively in measurements
  taken since the war in Gaza began. About half of US adults, 52%, now have an
  unfavorable view of Netanyahu in the new poll, which overlapped with his
  recent visit to the US. Just 29% view him positively. Republicans have a much
  more positive view of Netanyahu than Democrats and independents do. About
  two-thirds of Republicans view him favorably, which is in line with last year.
  About 1 in 10 Democrats and 2 in 10 independents feel the same way. “This is
  the first time we’ve seen a majority of Americans, with an unfavorable view of
  him,” said Gallup senior editor Megan Brenan. “All of these questions in this
  poll show us basically the same story, and it’s not a good one for the Israeli
  government right now.” As Senate Democrats plan to continue to keep up the
  pressure on the Trump administration over Jeffrey Epstein this week, minority
  leader Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor earlier to call on the FBI to
  undertake a counterintelligence threat assessment of Donald Trump’s Epstein
  connections. Calling for a risk assessment to examine whether foreign
  countries might have tried to access the Epstein files and possibly exploit
  the information as leverage over Trump, Schumer said: Americans are right to
  be angry over the lack of transparency. But this isn’t just about getting to
  the truth. This is also every bit about our national security. Whatever may be
  in the Epstein files is clearly troubling enough that Donald Trump doesn’t
  want to touch this issue with a ten-foot pole. So it’s natural to ask: what
  happens if America’s adversaries use cyber-attacks or other means to access
  investigative materials into Jeffrey Epstein that are embarrassing – or worse
  – for President Trump and the people around him? What happens if Epstein
  materials end up in the hands of the Chinese government, or Russia, or North
  Korea? Unless the Epstein files are released, and made fully transparent to
  the public, could our adversaries use that information to blackmail someone
  like the president? Or other senior leaders in government? What kind of risk
  could that pose to our national security? He went on: National security is not
  – and should never be – a partisan issue. We need to do everything we can to
  make sure we’re protecting the US and American families every single day. This
  report is imperative to do just that. And there is one more thing Donald Trump
  could do to quell people’s anger, confusion, frustration and fears over the
  national security ramifications: stop running away from this issue. Tell the
  truth. And if there is clearly no national security risk, release the Epstein
  files, President Trump. The Department of Justice has asked several large
  California counties to provide detailed personal information of non-citizens
  who got on to the state voter rolls, the Guardian has learned, in an unusual
  request that comes as the Trump administration has asked about a dozen states
  to provide wide swaths of information about voters and election practices. The
  justice department’s voting section sent identical letters to local election
  officials in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego on 9 July. The request
  asks the officials to provide the total number of non-citizens who had their
  voter registrations cancelled since 2020 as well as a copy of their voter
  registration records, voting history, date of birth, driver’s license numbers,
  and the last four digits of a social security number. The department sent a
  similar request to Orange county last month and then sued the county after
  officials redacted some information. “It’s deeply troubling,” said David
  Becker, the executive director for the Center for Election Innovation &amp;
  Research. “It reflects a pretty shocking misunderstanding of federal law
  regarding list maintenance.” The request for information on non-citizens comes
  as the Trump administration has arrested and moved to deport thousands of
  immigrants. Submitting a voter registration form while ineligible to vote is a
  crime so non-citizens that do so could be prosecuted and potentially deported.
  This kind of voter fraud, however, is extremely rare. All three counties said
  they were reviewing the justice department’s request. The justice department
  did not return a request for comment. Donald Trump said that the Wall Street
  Journal and its billionaire owner Rupert Murdoch want to settle the
  president’s defamation lawsuit against the newspaper. On 18 July, Trump
  promptly sued the WSJ and its owners, including Murdoch, over a story alleging
  that Trump’s name was on a “lewd” birthday message for the convicted sex
  offender Jeffrey Epstein, that included a sexually suggestive drawing and a
  reference to shared secrets. “I’ve been treated badly by the Wall Street
  Journal. I would have assumed that Rupert Murdoch controls it, but, you know,
  maybe does, maybe doesn’t,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “They
  are talking to us about doing something but we’ll see what happens. Maybe they
  would like us to drop that, so we’ll see ... yeah, they’re having, they want
  to settle it,” he said, adding, “when I get treated unfairly, I do things
  about it.” Trump’s lawsuit called the alleged letter “fake” and said the
  Journal published its article to harm his reputation. In a court filing
  yesterday, Trump asked a US court to order a swift deposition for Murdoch. The
  Wall Street Journal did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for
  comment. Donald Trump also told reporters on Air Force One that he thinks he
  will have a meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping before the end of the
  year, but did not elaborate. Donald Trump said he would start imposing tariffs
  and other measures on Russia “ten days from today” if Moscow did not make
  progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Trump, who first announced
  yesterday that he was cutting his initial 50-day deadline for action from
  Moscow, said he had not heard a response from Russia. He told reporters aboard
  Air Force One that he was not worried about the potential impact of Russian
  sanctions on the oil market or prices, saying the US would boost domestic oil
  production to offset any impact. Earlier today, my colleague Jakub Krupa
  reported that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Russia
  “has taken note” of president Trump’s comments. He then said that a “special
  military operation” – their term for their illegal, full-scale invasion of
  Ukraine – continues, but Russia “remains committed to the peace process to
  resolve the conflict around Ukraine and secure our interests” – despite deadly
  attacks overnight. Peskov also confirmed that there was a “slowdown” in
  Russian efforts to revive diplomatic relations with the US. Trump yesterday
  voiced his frustration with Vladimir Putin, saying: I thought we’d be able to
  negotiate something. Maybe that’ll still happen, but it’s very late down the
  process. I’m disappointed … I’m not so interested in talking any more.
  Ghislaine Maxwell has offered to testify before Congress but has asked
  lawmakers to give her immunity, along with other major conditions, according
  to a list of demands sent to the House oversight committee by her attorneys,
  seen by CNN. James Comer, who chairs the House oversight committee, subpoenaed
  Maxwell to testify next month. In a new letter sent to Comer today, Maxwell’s
  attorneys said they initially decided to invoke her fifth amendment rights,
  but then offered to cooperate with Congress “if a fair and safe path forward
  can be established”. The letter comes after Maxwell, Epstein’s accomplice who
  is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes, asked the
  US supreme court overturn her conviction. And her attorneys claim “any
  testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights,
  prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool”. The
  letter goes on: “Compounding these concerns are public comments from members
  of Congress that appear to have prejudged Ms. Maxwell’s credibility without
  even listening to what she has to say or evaluating the extensive
  documentation that corroborates it.” An oversight committee spokesperson
  rejected the idea of giving Maxwell immunity, telling CNN: The oversight
  committee will respond to Ms. Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not
  consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony. Per CNN’s report,
  Maxwell’s conditions as laid out by her attorneys include: A grant of formal
  immunity. The interview can’t happen at the correctional facility where she’s
  serving her sentence. “To prepare adequately for any congressional deposition
  – and to ensure accuracy and fairness – we would require the Committee’s
  questions in advance … Surprise questioning would be both inappropriate and
  unproductive.” The interview would be scheduled “only after the resolution of
  her supreme court petition and her forthcoming habeas petition”. If the
  demands cannot be met, her attorneys said: “Maxwell will have no choice but to
  invoke her fifth amendment rights” (the right to remain silent). The letter
  ends with an appeal for clemency from Donald Trump for which, her attorneys
  say, Maxwell would be “willing and eager” to testify. Of course, in the
  alternative, if Ms. Maxwell were to receive clemency, she would be willing –
  and eager – to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in
  Washington, D.C. She welcomes the opportunity to share the truth and to dispel
  the many misconceptions and misstatements that have plagued this case from the
  beginning. Donald Trump has said he and UK prime minister Keir Starmer did not
  discuss Britain’s plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September
  unless Israel holds to a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution. “We
  never did discuss it,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One. He and
  Starmer held talks in Scotland yesterday where the US president was asked
  about the UK’s commitment to recognizing a Palestinian state. He responded:
  I’m not going to take a position, I don’t mind him [the prime minister] taking
  a position. I’m looking for getting people fed right now. Reuters reports
  Trump also said: “You’re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they
  should be rewarded.” On this subject, longstanding ties between US
  conservatives and Israel are facing strain, with growing calls for the war to
  end and internal rifts reshaping the right. My colleague J Oliver Conroy asks
  today, is the US right turning on Israel? As the Israel-Gaza war nears its
  two-year mark, and as images of starving people and utter devastation flood
  social media, cracks seem to be emerging in the American right’s typically
  iron-clad support for Israel. The US continues to support Israel
  diplomatically and militarily, and last Thursday pulled out of peace
  negotiations that it accused Hamas of sabotaging. And in the US Congress, only
  two Republicans voted for a recent amendment that would have pulled funding
  for missile defense systems for Israel. Yet the war’s duration and human cost,
  as well as recent Israeli strikes on Christian targets, have spurred modest
  signs of discontent on the US right. Some conservative commentators have
  walked back their support for Israel’s war; the US’s famously Zionist
  ambassador to Israel rebuked the actions of Jewish settlers in the occupied
  West Bank, and an unresolved rift over foreign intervention continues to
  plague the Maga world. You can read the complete analysis here: Further to my
  last post regarding representative Marjorie Taylor Greene becoming the first
  Republican member of Congress to call Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide,
  Steve Bannon, Trump’s influential former adviser, has told Politico: It seems
  that for the under-30-year-old Maga base, Israel has almost no support, and
  Netanyahu’s attempt to save himself politically by dragging America in deeper
  to another Middle East war has turned off a large swath of older Maga
  diehards. Now President Trump’s public repudiation of one of the central
  tenants of Bibi’s Gaza strategy - ‘starving’ Palestinians - will only hasten a
  collapse of support. Politico also notes vice-president JD Vance’s remarks in
  Ohio yesterday, speaking of the “heartbreaking” images from Gaza. He said:
  Israel’s gotta do more to let that aid in and we’ve also gotta wage war on
  Hamas so that those folks stop preventing food from coming into this
  territory. “The days of the old GOP party line on Israel [unconditional
  support] could be numbered,” Politico writes. Here’s Donald Trump boarding Air
  Force One a short time ago to return to Washington, in Lossiemouth, Scotland.
  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is the first Republican member of
  Congress to call Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide. In a lengthy post on X
  yesterday, she wrote: It’s the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct
  7th in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the
  genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza. It marks a
  significant break for Greene, a Trump loyalist and prominent Maga figure, with
  the rest of her party, who have been consistently vocal in their unconditional
  support for Israel. Greene has been increasingly critical of Israel. Earlier
  this month, she said in another statement: “Israel bombed the Catholic Church
  in Gaza, and that entire population is being wiped out as they continue their
  aggressive war in Gaza.” In yesterday’s post, the Georgia Republican rebuked
  her colleague Randy Fine, of Florida, who is under fire for calling the
  suffering of Palestinian people as part of a campaign of “Muslim terror
  propaganda”. “Release the hostages,” he wrote in a social media post last
  week. “Until then, starve away.” Greene said of Fine on X: I can only imagine
  how Florida’s 6th district feels now that their Representative, that they were
  told to vote for, openly calls for starving innocent people and children … a
  Jewish U.S. Representative calling for the continued starvation of innocent
  people and children is disgraceful. His awful statement will actually cause
  more antisemitism. Related: Israel committing genocide in Gaza, say
  Israel-based human rights groups Fine’s comments came before Donald Trump
  acknowledged for the first time yesterday that there is “real starvation” in
  Gaza. In a rare break with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who has
  denied that Israel is causing starvation in the region), Trump told Israel to
  allow “every ounce of food” into Gaza. Today my colleagues report that Gaza
  has passed two grim landmarks on a single day, as UN-backed hunger experts
  warned a “worst-case scenario of famine” was unfolding in the strip and called
  for “immediate action” shortly before health officials announced the death
  toll from Israeli attacks had passed 60,000. With more than 145,000 others
  injured, nearly one in 10 Palestinians who lived in Gaza two years ago has
  become a casualty of the war. “The worst-case scenario of famine is currently
  playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase
  Classification (IPC) said in an alert that called for an urgent ceasefire to
  alleviate “widespread starvation”. Survivors face a famine caused by Israel
  blocking food aid and “relentless conflict”, the report said. “Immediate
  action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded,
  large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to
  stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.” You can follow our
  coverage of the crisis here: The shooter, Shane Tamura, who was identified by
  police as the gunman in yesterday’s shooting, worked at Caesars’ Horseshoe
  Center Strip Las Vegas as a surveillance department employee, according to the
  hotel and casino company. “Our thoughts are with the victims, their families,
  and all those affected by this tragic event,” Caesars said in a statement
  shared with NBC News. “We are cooperating with law enforcement and will not be
  commenting further.” NBC reports that records show a person with the name
  Shane Devon Tamura had a work card issued by the Nevada Private Investigators
  Licensing Board from 2019 to 2024. But that work card did not authorize him to
  carry a firearm. It is unclear what employment Tamura had held since then. The
  third of four victims in last night’s shooting has been identified as Julia
  Hyman, according to the New York Post. Hyman was killed on the 33rd floor of
  the office tower, where she worked for Rudin Management as an associate,
  reports the Post. She graduated from Cornell in 2020. The three other victims
  were all shot in the lobby of the building. They have been identified as NYPD
  officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, and the third is
  believed to be a security guard for the building who has not yet been named.
  The shooter’s intended target was the NFL offices in the building, according
  to NYC mayor Eric Adams. He took the wrong elevator and ended up on the 33rd
  floor offices of Rudin Management, where he opened fire again before shooting
  himself. The UJA Federation of New York, a Jewish philanthropic organization,
  released a statement memorializing Wesley LePatner, who was a member of the
  group’s board of directors. “We are devastated by the tragic loss of Wesley
  LePatner, a beloved member of UJA’s community and a member of our board of
  directors, who was killed in yesterday’s mass shooting in Midtown. Wesley was
  extraordinary in every way — personally, professionally, and
  philanthropically. An exceptional leader in the financial world, she brought
  thoughtfulness, vision, and compassion to everything she did. In 2023, we
  honored her with the Alan C. Greenberg Young Leadership Award at our Wall
  Street Dinner, recognizing her commitment to our community and her remarkable
  achievements, all the more notable as a woman in a traditionally
  male-dominated field. In the wake of October 7, Wesley led a solidarity
  mission with UJA to Israel, demonstrating her enduring commitment in Israel’s
  moment of heartache. She lived with courage and conviction, instilling in her
  two children a deep love for Judaism and the Jewish people. We mourn the loss
  of a life taken far too soon and extend our heartfelt condolences to her
  husband, Evan; her children; and her entire family. May Wesley’s memory be for
  a blessing — and a lasting source of strength and inspiration.” Several
  bunches of flowers are now attached to the railing of a ramp leading to the
  Park Avenue building’s front door, along with a yellow balloon with the words
  “LOVE ONE ANOTHER!!” written on it. A spokesman for audit and advisory firm
  KPMG said in a statement their office at 345 Park Avenue will be closed on
  Tuesday, reports Reuters. No KPMG employees were injured in the shooting,
  according to a post by chair and CEO Tim Walsh and US managing principal Atif
  Zaim on the company’s LinkedIn page. “Our hearts are with the victims of this
  horrific act and their families, as well as all of our neighbors in 345 Park.
  This was a terrible, tragic, and frightening event. We are incredibly grateful
  for the bravery of building security and law enforcement. At this time, we are
  not aware of any significant physical injuries to our KPMG colleagues,” the
  statement on LinkedIn said. New York governor Kathy Hochul is calling for
  Congress to pass a national assault weapons ban following yesterday’s shooting
  in Manhattan which killed four people. In a statement this morning, Hochul
  noted the suspect used an AR-15-style assault rifle, a commonly used weapon in
  mass shootings in the US. New York has some of the strongest gun laws in the
  nation. We banned assault weapons. We strengthened our Red Flag Law. We closed
  dangerous loopholes. But our laws only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained
  in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder.
  The time to act is now. The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers.
  They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun
  lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent
  lives are stolen. The shooter was a Las Vegas resident. He had appeared to
  have driven over three days to reach New York City. Hochul also condemned the
  shooting as a “horrific act of violence” and paid tribute to NYPD officer
  Didarul Islam. “My heart is with his loved ones, his NYPD family and every
  victim of this tragedy,” Hochul said. Here is my colleague Ed Pilkington’s
  report: An NFL employee was also injured in the shooting and was in stable
  condition at a hospital, according to a memo sent by NFL commissioner Roger
  Goodell to league staff. Goodell wrote there would be “increased security
  presence” at the league’s offices “in the days and weeks to come”, ESPN
  reported. He also said employees based in New York should work remotely
  Tuesday or could take the day off. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a
  serious brain disease with no known treatment that can be caused by repeated
  bangs to the head from contact sports. It has been linked to aggression and
  dementia, and the NFL has paid an estimated $1bn to settle concussion-related
  lawsuits with thousands of retired players after the deaths of several
  high-profile players, Reuters reports. Tamura was never an NFL player, but
  online records show he played in high school. The note found in his wallet
  said his football career was cut short by his brain injury, Bloomberg News
  reported. The suspect, Shane Tamura, appeared to have driven to New York City
  from Las Vegas over three days and to have acted alone, New York police
  commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters last night. He entered the
  skyscraper’s lobby, turned to his right and immediately shot the NYPD officer,
  Didarul Islam, who was assigned to the building’s security detail. Tisch said
  Tamura used an M4 Carbine, a semi-automatic rifle popular with civilian US gun
  enthusiasts modeled on a fully automatic rifle used in the military. He then
  shot a woman and two men in the lobby but inexplicably allowed another woman
  to pass him unharmed before he took the elevator to the 33rd-floor offices of
  Rudin Management. There he fatally shot his final victim before taking his own
  life, Tisch said. A widely circulated photo showed the permit issued to Tamura
  by the Las Vegas metropolitan police department allowing him to legally carry
  a concealed firearm. An additional weapon – a loaded revolver – was later
  recovered from the black BMW vehicle Tamura had left double-parked outside the
  office tower, along with a backpack and prescription medications, Tisch said.
  To recap, the gunman who opened fire in a Manhattan office building left a
  note that appeared to blame the National Football League for a brain injury,
  New York mayor Eric Adams has said on the airwaves this morning. The suspect,
  Shane Tamura, 27, brought the carnage to an end not long after it began on
  Monday evening by fatally shooting himself in the chest on the 33rd floor of
  the Park Avenue skyscraper. The building houses NFL headquarters. Adams said
  the preliminary investigation shows the gunman took the wrong elevator bank
  and, instead of getting to NFL headquarters, ended up at Rudin Management,
  which owns the building at 345 Park Avenue. “That is where he carried out
  additional shootings and took the lives of additional employees,” Adams told
  CBS this morning. A security staffer remained hospitalized in critical
  condition, Adams said. The gunman shot a woman in the lobby, then a security
  guard who was hiding behind the counter, he said. Four people, including the
  security guard – an off-duty New York City police officer – and a Blackstone
  real estate executive, were killed. In what Adams called an “uncanny episode”,
  the gunman allowed a woman to walk past him without shooting before taking the
  elevator up to Rudin and discharging multiple rounds there. The NYPD officer
  has been identified as Didarul Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh and a
  father of two whose wife is pregnant. He was working off-hours as a security
  guard at the time. Adams described him as a “true blue hero”. Blackstone
  released a statement identifying the executive as Wesley LePatner. “Words
  cannot express the devastation we feel,” the statement read. Here’s a little
  more on the note left by the shooter, in which he claimed he had been
  suffering from CTE – the degenerative brain disease that has been linked to
  concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports like
  football – and said his brain should be studied after he died, two people
  familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. Donald Trump has condemned
  the “senseless act of violence” in which four people were killed in the
  Manhattan office shooting. “I have been briefed on the tragic shooting that
  took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love,” Trump wrote on his
  Truth Social platform. “I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the
  bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence.”
  “My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including
  the NYPD Officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice,” he added. The president
  will return to the US from Scotland tonight. The New York Times reports that
  the mayor, Eric Adams, also said on Good Day New York that the shooter had
  intended to go to the NFL offices on the lower floors of 345 Park Avenue but
  “appeared to have gone to the wrong floor”. “There are two different elevator
  banks,” Adams said. “Some banks don’t go to every floor. He appeared to have
  gone to the wrong bank, and he ended up on the floor of Rudin Management.” The
  gunman who opened fire in a Manhattan office building left a note that
  appeared to blame the National Football League for his brain injury, New York
  mayor Eric Adams said. Two officials familiar with the matter previously told
  NBC News that in the note found at the shooting scene, the suspect wondered
  about CTE – a brain condition caused by head trauma – as a possible cause of
  his mental illness. “He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he
  felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact
  sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,” Adams said in an
  interview with CBS’s “This Morning”. The skyscraper where the shooting
  occurred Monday evening houses the NFL headquarters. In an interview on
  MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”, Adams was asked about a possible link, noting that
  while the suspect, Shane Tamura, didn’t play college football, he did play at
  his California high school. “He talked about CTE. He was not an NFL player. We
  have reason to believe that he was focused on the NFL agency that was located
  in the building, and we’re going to continue to investigate with our federal
  partners to ensure that we can find a reason and identify any other weapons,”
  Adams responded. Investment giant Blackstone Inc said that a senior executive
  was among the people killed when a gunman, carrying an assault rifle, walked
  into the lobby of a midtown Manhattan office building and opened fire on
  Monday. “We are heartbroken to share that our colleague, Wesley LePatner, was
  among those who lost their lives in the tragic incident at 345 Park Avenue.
  Words cannot express the devastation we feel,” the company said in a
  statement. LePatner was a senior managing director at the firm and global head
  of core+ real estate and the chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate
  Income Trust (BREIT), the firm added. Here are some pictures from the
  ribbon-cutting ceremony during the opening of Donald Trump’s new golf course,
  the Trump International Golf Links, in Balmedie earlier. This is the final day
  of his five-day visit to Scotland. Twenty-one Senate Democrats are demanding
  Donald Trump immediately cut funding to a controversial Gaza aid organization
  they say has resulted in the killings of more than 700 civilians seeking food
  and violated decades of humanitarian law. The letter, led by senators Chris
  Van Hollen of Maryland and Peter Welch of Vermont, comes as international
  criticism mounts over the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s
  operations, arguing that its model “shatters well-established norms that have
  governed distribution of humanitarian aid since the ratification of the Geneva
  conventions in 1949” by blurring the lines between aid delivery and military
  security operations. “According to reports and eyewitness accounts, civilians
  have been fired at by tanks, drones, and helicopters, as well as soldiers on
  the ground, as they attempt to get food and humanitarian supplies,” the
  senators wrote. The Trump administration authorized a $30m grant to the Gaza
  Humanitarian Foundation in late June, with $7m already disbursed according to
  documents seen by the Guardian. The organization, which is backed by both
  Israeli and US interests, has been given preferential access to operate in
  Gaza through coordination with the Israeli military and private US security
  contractors. However, the rollout of the new scheme has been marked by death
  and destruction from the outset. Jake Wood, the founding executive director
  and former US marine, resigned on 25 May, saying: “It is not possible to
  implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian
  principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I
  will not abandon.” Boston Consulting Group, the US firm handling some of the
  foundation’s logistics, also withdrew shortly after. The US Department of
  Justice is facing a federal lawsuit for refusing to release a legal memorandum
  that reportedly cleared the way for Donald Trump’s acceptance of a $400m
  luxury aircraft from Qatar’s government. The Freedom of the Press Foundation,
  represented by the watchdog group American Oversight, filed the Freedom of
  Information Act (Foia) lawsuit in Washington DC’s federal district court after
  the justice department failed to produce the document despite granting
  expedited processing more than two months ago. The president’s “deal to take a
  $400m luxury jet from a foreign government deserves full public scrutiny – not
  a stiff-arm from the Department of Justice”, American Oversight’s executive
  director, Chioma Chukwu, said in a press release. “This is precisely the kind
  of corrupt arrangement that public records laws are designed to expose.” The
  case revisits Trump’s decision to accept the extravagant foreign gift: a
  luxury Boeing 747-8 jetliner dubbed a “palace in the sky”. Before the
  president’s frustrated base would start to call for the release of all Jeffrey
  Epstein files, followed by renewed scrutiny of the convicted sex offender’s
  friendship with Trump, what came to be known as “Qatar-gate” was one of the
  first symbols of the new administration that even stalwart Trump allies shook
  their heads at when the deal first emerged in May. At the time, the US senator
  Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, warned the aircraft “poses significant espionage
  and surveillance problems”. The senator Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia
  Republican, said she would “be checking for bugs”. Former UN ambassador Nikki
  Haley, also a Republican, called accepting foreign gifts “never a good
  practice” that “threatens intelligence and national security”. The Democratic
  US House member Ritchie Torres called it a “flying grift” that violated the
  constitution’s emoluments clause prohibiting federal officials from accepting
  valuable foreign presents without congressional approval. The justice
  department filed a misconduct complaint on Monday against US district court
  chief judge James Boasberg, a prominent Washington, DC, judge who has drawn
  president Donald Trump’s ire, US attorney general Pam Bondi said on X.
  Boasberg said in April that the Trump administration appeared to have acted
  “in bad faith” when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights on 15
  March at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to
  assess the legality of the effort. “Today at my direction, @TheJusticeDept
  filed a misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James
  Boasberg for making improper public comments about President Trump and his
  Administration,” Bondi said, without specifying which comments was she
  referring to. Donald Trump has said he is “working together” with Israel “to
  try and get things straightened out” in Gaza amid warnings of severe mass
  starvation in the enclave. After opening his new golf course in Menie,
  Aberdeenshire, a reporter from the crowd asked the US president “what will you
  say next to Benjamin Netanyahu”, the prime minister of Israel. “We’re working
  together to try and get things straightened out,” Trump said. Earlier during
  his speech at the course, the US leader said he would fly back to the
  Washington to “put out fires all over the world”. Donald Trump’s
  administration has initiated a probe into Duke University and the Duke Law
  Journal over allegations of race-related discrimination, making it the latest
  American university to face the threat of cuts to federal funding. The
  government said on Monday it will probe whether the Duke Law Journal’s
  selection of its editors gives preferences to candidates from minority
  communities. “This investigation is based on recent reporting alleging that
  Duke University discriminates on the bases of race, color, and/or national
  origin by using these factors to select law journal members,” the Education
  Department said in a statement. US education secretary Linda McMahon and
  health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr sent a letter to the university’s
  leadership alleging what the government called “the use of race preferences in
  Duke’s hiring, admissions, and scholarship decisions.” The letter urged the
  university to review its policies and create a panel “with delegated authority
  from Duke’s Board of Trustees to enable Duke and the federal government to
  move quickly toward a mutual resolution of Duke’s alleged civil rights
  violations.” Duke had no immediate comment, Reuters reported. Rights advocates
  have raised free speech and academic freedom concerns over the Trump
  administration’s attempted crackdown against universities. Donald Trump’s
  strategy of imposing sweeping tariffs on America’s main trading partners will
  face a major test in the US courts on Thursday, four days after the president
  hailed the “powerful deal” reached with the EU and just hours before a new
  round of punishing import duties is set to come into effect. Trump has
  underpinned his tariff policy with an emergency power that is now being
  challenged as unlawful in the federal courts. On Thursday the US court of
  appeals for the federal circuit will hear oral arguments in the case, VOS
  Selections v Trump. A group of small business owners are suing the US
  president on grounds that he lacks legal authority from Congress to impose
  severe tariffs that could damage their bottom line. The Trump administration
  has invoked a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
  (IEEPA), claiming that various national emergencies – including US trade
  deficits with trading partners and the scourge of fentanyl trafficking –
  demand urgent action. But the plaintiffs have countered that the IEEPA does
  not give the president the power to impose tariffs, and has never been used in
  such a way in its almost half a century on the statute books. The case has the
  potential to derail Trump’s most significant tariff deals and negotiations,
  which he has made a centrepiece of his second presidency. Given how much is
  riding on it, the suit is likely eventually to be settled by the US supreme
  court under its current 6-3 supermajority of hard-right justices. In the short
  term, the challenge under the IEEPA looms as a black cloud over Trump’s desire
  to claim victory on the tariff front, as his controversial strategy of
  slapping hefty import duties on major trading partners continues to roil
  global trade and markets. On Sunday, Trump struck a deal at his golf club in
  Scotland with the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, that will
  see 15% import tariffs on most EU goods entering the US. Then on Friday, a day
  after the appeals court hears oral arguments, Trump’s latest round of
  potentially destabilizing import duties is set to kick in. The targeted
  countries include some of the biggest suppliers of US imports, including
  Canada and Mexico. Donald Trump’s timeline for a peace deal between Russia and
  Ukraine has sped up, the president said while visiting Nato ally Great Britain
  on Monday. “I’m going to make a new deadline of about 10, 10 or 12 days from
  today,” Trump said in response to a question while sitting with the British
  prime minister, Keir Starmer. “There’s no reason in waiting. There’s no reason
  in waiting. It’s 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don’t see any
  progress being made.” Russian and Ukrainian diplomats met in Istanbul last
  week, agreeing on little more than a prisoner exchange. Ukraine proposed a
  summit by the end of August between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but Russia’s reply was
  that such a meeting would only be appropriate if it were to sign an agreement.
  The meeting was the third negotiation in Istanbul. Putin has not attended any
  of the talks, despite Trump’s exhortations. The Trump administration must
  continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics for Medicaid-funded services,
  a federal judge ruled on Monday, in an escalating legal war between the
  reproductive health giant and the White House over Republican efforts to
  “defund” Planned Parenthood. Days after Donald Trump signed his sweeping tax
  bill, Planned Parenthood sued over a provision in the bill that ended Medicaid
  payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000
  from Medicaid in 2023, such as Planned Parenthood. The new court order, from
  US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston, will protect Medicaid funding for
  all Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide while litigation in the case
  continues. The order also replaces and expands a previous edict handed down by
  Talwani, which initially granted a preliminary injunction specifically
  blocking the government from cutting Medicaid payments only to Planned
  Parenthood affiliates that did not provide abortions or did not receive at
  least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in a given year. “Patients are
  likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or
  unavailable,” Talwani wrote in her Monday order. “In particular, restricting
  members’ ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in
  unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access
  to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated
  STIs.” More than 80 million people rely on Medicaid, the US government’s
  insurance program for low-income people. It is already illegal to use Medicaid
  to pay for most abortions, but Planned Parenthood clinics – which treat a
  disproportionate number of people who use Medicaid – rely on the program to
  reimburse it for services such as birth control, STI tests and cancer
  screenings. Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was not seeking a summit with
  Chinese president Xi Jinping, but added that he may visit China at Xi’s
  invitation, which Trump said had been extended. “I may go to China, but it
  would only be at the invitation of President Xi, which has been extended.
  Otherwise, no interest!,” Trump said on Truth Social. Aides to Trump and Xi
  have discussed a potential meeting between the leaders during a trip by the US
  president to Asia later this year, sources previously told Reuters. North
  Korea said on Tuesday the United States must accept that reality has changed
  since the countries’ summit meetings in the past, and no future dialogue would
  end its nuclear program, state media KCNA reported. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful
  sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who is believed to speak for her
  brother, said she conceded that the personal relationship between Kim and US
  president Donald Trump “is not bad.” But if Washington intended to use a
  personal relationship as a way to end the North’s nuclear weapons program, the
  effort would only be the subject of “mockery,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement
  carried by KCNA. “If the US fails to accept the changed reality and persists
  in the failed past, the DPRK-US meeting will remain as a ‘hope’ of the US
  side,” she said, referring to North Korea’s official name, the Democratic
  People’s Republic of Korea. North Korea’s capabilities as a nuclear weapons
  state and the geopolitical environment have radically changed since Kim and
  Trump held talks three times during the US president’s first term, she said.
  “Any attempt to deny the position of the DPRK as a nuclear weapons state ...
  will be thoroughly rejected,” she said. Top US and Chinese economic officials
  arrived on Tuesday at the venue where they are conducting their latest
  bilateral round of trade negotiations, this time held in Stockholm, after
  previous rounds in London and Geneva. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei
  Akazawa, said on Tuesday the trade agreement with the US guaranteed Japan
  would always get the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals out of
  all the pacts negotiated by Washington. “If a third country agrees with the
  United States on lower rates on chips and pharmaceuticals, the same rates
  would be applied to Japan,” he told a news conference. Donald Trump has
  arrived at the opening ceremony for his new golf course in Aberdeenshire,
  arriving to the tune of bagpipes at the event at his course in Menie. He
  thanked his son Eric, who he said had “worked so hard” on creating the New
  Course at the resort. The president also thanked John Swinney, who was among
  the assembled audience. Eric Trump had earlier said he and the Trump
  International team had created an “amazing masterpiece” at the New Course. US
  House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed his concern over the “horrific
  shooting”, and said he was “praying hard” for the NYPD officer. “May God watch
  over our city during this challenging moment,” Jeffries wrote in a post. A
  large police presence converged on the area around the tower, according to
  Reuters journalists near the scene. “I just saw a lot of commotion and cops
  and people screaming,” said Russ McGee, a 31-year-old sports bettor who was
  working out in a gym adjacent to the skyscraper, told Reuters in an interview
  near the scene. The office building at 345 Park Avenue occupies an entire city
  block and houses the corporate offices for the National Football League and
  the headquarters of investment firm Blackstone. It also holds offices for JP
  Morgan Chase. According to an ESPN reporter, Jeff Darlington, an NFL security
  alert was sent to employees: “Do not exit the building. Secure your location
  and hide until law enforcement clears your floor. Please switch phones to
  silent.” This shooting is the 254th mass shooting in the US this year,
  according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks gun-related
  violence, who defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more
  people, excluding the shooter, are killed or injured by firearms. Donald Trump
  has met with the Scottish first minister John Swinney at his Aberdeenshire
  golf club. The president is opening a second course at his Menie Estate
  property on Tuesday and it is understood the first minister met with Trump
  shortly before the ceremony. The leaders spoke for around 15 minutes, before
  posing together for pictures in front of a US flag and the saltire of Scotland
  ahead of the opening of a second course at the president’s golf club in
  Aberdeenshire. Swinney has previously said he would push the president on an
  exemption to tariffs for Scotch whisky and raise the situation in Gaza, which
  also came up in the meeting between Trump and prime minister Keir Starmer on
  Monday. Meanwhile, Trump was spotted on the driving range of his golf club
  during a delay in the opening ceremony for a new course. Trump could be seen
  hitting shots from the driving range just yards where the first tee of the new
  course, where he is expected to be the first to tee off. President Donald
  Trump is opening a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday,
  capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family’s luxury
  properties and playing golf. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr, are
  cutting the ceremonial ribbon and playing the first-ever round at the new
  Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland, AP
  reported. The overseas jaunt let Trump escape Washington’s sweaty summer
  humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein. It was
  mostly built around golf – and walking the new course before it officially
  begins offering rounds to the public on 13 August, adding to a lengthy list of
  ways Trump has used the White House to promote his brand. Billing itself the
  “Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,” the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was
  designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event
  later this week, after Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already
  been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday, and, on the
  highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers on to the correct
  road. Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put
  their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps
  ahead of Trump’s arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf,
  including wearing golf shoes, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to
  watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start.
  Another group of people were watching from the other side in tall grass
  growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole. Hello and welcome to the US
  politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the
  latest news over the next few hours. We start with the news that a gunman
  killed four people at a Manhattan skyscraper that houses the headquarters of
  the NFL and the offices of several major financial firms before turning the
  gun on himself, New York officials have said. An NYPD officer identified as
  Didarul Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh and a father of two whose wife is
  pregnant, was among those killed. He was working off-hours as a security guard
  at the time, New York mayor Eric Adams told reporters, describing him as a
  “true blue hero”. Authorities offered few details about the three other
  victims killed by the suspect – two men and a woman. A third male was gravely
  wounded by the gunfire and was “fighting for his life” in a nearby hospital,
  the mayor said. Jessica Tisch, the New York City police commissioner,
  confirmed that “the lone shooter has been neutralized”. New York police also
  said the shooter acted alone and was dead. Tisch said the gunman, identified
  as Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental
  illness, had driven cross-country to New York in recent days. The shooting
  spree in the evening rush hour began in the lobby of the Park Avenue tower in
  Midtown Manhattan. Tisch said that surveillance videos showed the gunman
  exiting a double-parked Black BMW between 51st and 52nd street on Park Avenue.

  Maxwell asked the supreme court to overturn her conviction for taking part in
  and facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes, arguing that a non-prosecution
  agreement with the late sex offender struck by federal prosecutors in Florida
  in 2008 should have barred any of his co-conspirators from prosecution as
  well. Donald Trump said that he did indeed bar Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago
  club for “inappropriate” behavior. But the president explained that what was
  inappropriate was not, as his aides have suggested, doing something lewd or
  illegal, but hiring away staff from the club. An Israeli settler who was
  sanctioned by Joe Biden as a violent extremist, but removed from the sanctions
  list by Trump, was arrested in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday after
  the fatal shooting of a Palestinian activist. The Palestinian man who was
  killed was denied entry to the United States last month when he arrived in San
  Francisco for a series of planned talks sponsored by faith groups, including a
  progressive Jewish synagogue. The US justice department filed a misconduct
  complaint against a federal judge who has clashed with the administration over
  deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador over private comments first

This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. We will be back at it on Wednesday. In the meantime, here are the latest developments: Donald Trump ended a visit to his golf resorts in Scotland, where he once again repeated his bizarre boast that he “predicted” the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum during a visit to the courses that summer which, in fact, began the day after the vote Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he broke with Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender he socialized with for more than a decade, after he “stole” young, female spa attendants away from Mar-a-Lago, including Virginia Giuffre, who became one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers. A Republican-led congressional committee rejected the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell’s demand that she be granted immunity before agreeing to testify about Epstein to Congress. Trump expressed sympathy for “kids that are starving” in Gaza, but repeated the debunked Israeli talking point that Hamas is to stealing aid, and endorsed the chaotic system of aid distribution run by Israel with US support that has cost 1,000 Palestinians their lives. The Senate voted 50-49 to confirm Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for Trump to a lifetime seat on a federal appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring court orders. The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Emil Bove, a top justice department official and former defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a federal appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring court orders. The vote broke nearly along party lines, with 50 Republican senators voting for his confirmation to a seat on the third circuit court of appeals overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin Islands. All Democrats opposed his nomination along with Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Tennessee senator Bill Hagerty missed the vote. Bove’s nomination for the lifetime position has faced strident opposition from Democrats, after Erez Reuveni, a former justice department official who was fired from his post, alleged that during his time at the justice department, Bove told lawyers that they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you’ and ignore any such court order” blocking efforts to remove immigrants to El Salvador. In testimony before the committee last month, Bove denied the accusation, and Reuveni later provided text messages that supported his claim. US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has privately discussed the idea of resigning so he can run for governor next year in Tennessee, NBC News reports, citing “two people who have spoken directly with him about it.” The people who have spoken with Hegseth said he has specifically mentioned a possible campaign for governor in Tennessee, where he lives. The state has an open race for governor next year, though there are eligibility requirements for candidates that Hegseth might not meet. Ultimately, both sources said, it was unclear after their conversations with Hegseth whether he would take the leap. But they both said he has contemplated it. The network also reported a denial from Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman who said in a statement: “Fake news NBC is so desperate for attention, they are shopping around a made up story… again. Only two options exist: either the ‘sources’ are imaginary or these reporters are getting punked. Secretary Hegseth’s focus remains solely on serving under President Trump and advancing the America First mission at the Department of Defense.” Donald Trump has arrived back in Washington after a long weekend at his golf resorts in Scotland and the White House has started to post selected clips from his remarks to reporters on Air Force One this afternoon. In one clip posted on social media by an official White House account, Trump was asked about the images from Gaza of starving children. “I think everybody — unless they’re pretty coldhearted or, worse than that, nuts — there’s nothing you can say other than ‘it’s terrible’ when you see… kids that are starving. And you see the mothers, they love them so much and there’s just nothing they seem to be able to do”, Trump said. “They got to get them food, and we’re going to get them food.” Earlier in the informal news conference, however, Trump had suggested that the blame lies not with Israel, the occupying power that has cut off humanitarian aid deliveries to the besieged Palestinian territory for months, but Hamas. “I think Israel wants to do it, actually”, Trump said to a reporter who asked if Israel could be relied on to provide aid to the starving population. “I can tell you that they want to do it. They don’t want Hamas stealing the money or stealing the food, and that’s what they’ve been doing.” International aid groups have said for months that there is no evidence that Hamas is stealing aid intended for the civilian population of Gaza, and on Saturday, the New York Times reported that Israel’s military “never found proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from the United Nations”. Trump also told reporters that he was confident that Israel “can do a good job” of overseeing the distribution of food in the Gaza Strip. “They want to preside over the food centers to make sure the distribution is proper”, an apparent endorsement of the chaotic and deadly system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a collaboration between Israel’s military and US private contractors, which has led to the killing of more than 1,000 Palestinians since May. Trump also told reporters that he has not yet given up on his scheme to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population, the majority of whom were previously displaced from what is now Israel. “It’s a concept that some people fell in love with and some people don’t. We really have to see how it all works out before we do that”, Trump said. “You could do something spectacular, but that’s a different concept. You could also probably do it if you let some, some are leaving automatically, some would like to leave, I think many would like to leave if they were given an alternative”. “But certainly that was a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people”, the president claimed, “but also some people didn’t like it.” A Republican-led congressional committee rejected the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell’s demand that she be granted immunity before agreeing to testify about the crimes of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to Congress. Maxwell, who was convicted in federal court in New York in 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse multiple minor girls over the course of a decade, is serving a 20-year sentence in Florida. Amid the uproar over the Trump administration’s decision not to release documents from the federal investigation into Epstein, who socialized with Donald Trump for more than a decade, Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify privately to the House oversight committee. The committee wants to depose Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, on 11 August 11 at the federal prison where she is being held in Tallahassee. But Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, wrote to the committee’s chair, Republican congressman James Comer, that “Ms Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity”. Comer’s spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement: “The oversight committee will respond to Ms Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.” Markus, who has suggested that Maxwell might ask Trump for a pardon, is also asking the supreme court to overturn Maxwell’s conviction, on the grounds that a non-prosecution agreement a federal prosecutor in Florida offered Epstein in 2008 should have barred the later prosecution of Maxwell in New York in 2020. Her lawyer also told Comer that his client would only agree to testify if the deposition was conducted somewhere other than the prison and if she is provided with the committee’s questions in advance. Congresswoman Summer Lee, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has been outspoken in her criticism of Israel’s assault on Gaza, condemned the mistreatment of the American labor activist Chris Smalls by Israeli soldiers after they raided the Handala, an aid ship that attempted to reach Gaza as part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. “Chris Smalls—a Black American labor leader—was trying to feed Palestinians being starved in Gaza. The IDF detained and beat him for it”, the progressive lawmaker commented on Instagram. “This assault must not go unnoticed and he must be freed immediately. Israel must be held to account. Let aid through. End the genocide.” As our colleague Adria Walker reports, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, a grassroots international collective that has worked to end Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2010, said Smalls “was physically assaulted by seven uniformed individuals” who “choked him and kicked him in the legs, leaving visible signs of violence on his neck and back”. Read Adria’s report here: Experts on Tuesday urged California governor Gavin Newsom to drop his “tit-for-tat redistricting” threat in response to a Republican plan to pick up congressional seats in Texas. “You can’t fight gerrymandering with more gerrymandering,” Patricia Sinay, a commissioner for the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, said on a call organized by the watchdog group Common Cause. “It is a short sighted plan.” California Democrats say they are prepared to redraw the state’s 52 congressional districts in a longshot and controversial effort to pick up Democratic seats. Newsom, seen as a likely presidential candidate in 2028, has threatened to redraw the state’s 52 congressional districts – a longshot bid to offset Republican gains in Texas with Democratic gains in California. Texas is considering mid-year redistricting at the urging of Donald Trump, who is angling to stave off losses in the Congressional midterm elections next year. Voter backlash at the polls could cost Republicans their House majority, and seriously blunt his agenda. While some partisans are cheering the efforts – especially Democrats hungry to see their elected officials take a tough stand in political fights with Republicans – experts warn that it’s not the “port in the storm” they are seeking. “Rolling back independent redistricting is bad policy. It’s also a waste of time,” said Emily Eby French, Texas policy director of Common Cause. “Come on down to Texas governor Newsom. We’ll show you how to fight the bad stuff without sacrificing the good stuff.” Dan Vicuña, a senior policy director for voting and fair representation at Common Cause, said the group was ready to challenge any attempt by California – or any state - to override its independent redistricting commission. “Although this is a very troubling and dangerous moment, one thing that’s useful is that it clarifies what this issue is about,” Vicuña said. “When we see politicians of both major parties willing to manipulate the process, manipulate voting districts, gerrymander at will, it’s a helpful reminder that this is, in fact, not a Democrat versus Republican issue. This is the politicians versus the people issue.” Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he broke with Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender he socialized with for more than a decade, after he hired young, female spa attendants away from Mar-a-Lago, including Virginia Giuffre, who became one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers. Trump was asked to elaborate on his claim, on Monday in Scotland, that he kicked Epstein out of his club “because he did something that was inappropriate”, specifically “he stole people that worked for me”. On the flight back to Washington from Scotland on Tuesday, one reporter asked Trump if “the workers that were taken from you, were some of them young women?” Trump replied: “The answer is yes; they were. People that worked in the spa”. Another reporter then asked if Trump one of the people he was referring to was Giuffre, who said in a legal complaint that she was hired away from the Mar-a-Lago spa by Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was 16. Giuffre, who died this year, alleged in her complaint that she was first abused by Epstein and Maxwell together, and then “lent out to other powerful men”, including Prince Andrew. Trump replied: “I think so, I think that was one of the people, yeah. He stole her”. Senior White House aides have repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that Trump broke with Epstein around 2004, and expelled him from the Mar-a-Lago club for inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature. The president’s account of the break being motivated by pique at having his employees poached by his friend cast the break in a different light. His claim that one of those employees was the 16-year-old Virginia Giuffre also complicates the timeline. Giuffre was hired away from Mar-a-Lago in 2000, but two years later, Trump spoke highly of Epstein to a reporter, and made a point of his friend’s taste for young women. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy”, Trump told New York magazine in late 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” Sarah Blaskey, a Miami Herald investigative reporter, also pointed out in her 2020 book on Mar-a-Lago that Epstein remained on the membership rolls of Mar-a-Lago until October 2007, more than a year after he was first arrested and charged with soliciting prostitution from a minor. As Israel’s war in Gaza nears its two-year mark, and as horrifying images of starving people and utter devastation flood social media, cracks seem to be emerging in the American right’s typically iron-clad support for Israel. Marjorie Taylor Greene became the first Republican member of Congress to call Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide, while Steve Bannon, Trump’s influential former adviser, told Politico: “It seems that for the under-30-year-old Maga base, Israel has almost no support, and Netanyahu’s attempt to save himself politically by dragging America in deeper to another Middle East war has turned off a large swath of older Maga diehards. Now President Trump’s public repudiation of one of the central tenants of Bibi’s Gaza strategy - ‘starving’ Palestinians - will only hasten a collapse of support.” Indeed support for Israel’s military action in Gaza has declined substantially among US adults, with only about a third approving, according to a new Gallup poll, which also found that about half of US adults now have an unfavorable view of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the most negative rating he has received. On Palestine, Trump said he and UK prime minister Keir Starmer did not discuss Britain’s plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel holds to a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution. “We never did discuss it,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One. Ghislaine Maxwell has offered to testify before Congress but has asked lawmakers to give her immunity, along with other major conditions, according to a list of demands sent to the House oversight committee by her attorneys, seen by CNN. If the demands cannot be met, her attorneys said: “Maxwell will have no choice but to invoke her fifth amendment rights” (the right to remain silent). An oversight committee spokesperson rejected the idea of giving Maxwell immunity, telling CNN: “The oversight committee will respond to Ms. Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor earlier to call on the FBI to undertake a counterintelligence threat assessment of Donald Trump’s Epstein connections. He highlighted the need to examine whether foreign countries might have tried to access the Epstein files and possibly exploit the information as leverage over the president. New York governor Kathy Hochul called for Congress to pass a national assault weapons ban following yesterday’s shooting in Manhattan which killed four people (and the shooter, who killed himself). “New York has some of the strongest gun laws in the nation ... But our laws only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder,” Hochul said. Police are investigating whether the gunman was targeting the National Football League. In a note, the suspect, who appeared to have driven from Las Vegas to New York City over three days, appeared to blame the NFL for a brain injury. He claimed he suffered from CTE – the degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports like football – and said his brain should be studied after he died. A preliminary investigation found that he took the wrong elevator, ending up on the wrong floor when he opened fire in the 345 Park Avenue building, which houses the NFL headquarters. Trump said he would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia “ten days from today” if Moscow did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The US president, who first announced yesterday that he was cutting his initial 50-day deadline for action from Moscow, said he had not heard a response from Russia. Trump said the Wall Street Journal and its billionaire owner Rupert Murdoch want to settle the president’s defamation lawsuit against the newspaper. On 18 July, Trump promptly sued the WSJ and its owners, including Murdoch, over a story alleging that Trump’s name was on a “lewd” birthday message for the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, that included a sexually suggestive drawing and a reference to shared secrets. “They want to settle it,” Trump said, adding, “when I get treated unfairly, I do things about it.” Trump’s lawsuit called the alleged letter “fake” and said the Journal published its article to harm his reputation. In a court filing yesterday, Trump asked a US court to order a swift deposition for Murdoch. The Department of Justice asked several large California counties to provide detailed personal information of non-citizens who got on to the state voter rolls, the Guardian has learned, in an unusual request that comes as the Trump administration has asked about a dozen states to provide wide swaths of information about voters and election practices. Support for Israel’s military action in Gaza has declined substantially among US adults, with only about a third approving, according to a new Gallup poll — a drop from the beginning of the war with Hamas, when about half of Americans approved of Israel’s operation. The new polling also found that about half of US adults now have an unfavorable view of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the most negative rating he has received since he was first included in Gallup polling in 1997. The poll was conducted from 7-21 July, while reports of starvation in Gaza led to international criticism of Israel’s decision to restrict food aid but before Donald Trump expressed concern over the worsening humanitarian situation. The findings underscore the Israeli government’s dramatic loss of support within America. But not everyone is shifting — instead, the war has become more politically polarizing. The rising disapproval is driven by Democrats and independents, who are much less likely to approve of Israel’s actions than they were in November 2023, weeks after Hamas’ 7 October attacks. Republicans, on the other hand, remain largely supportive of both Israel’s military actions and Netanyahu (though cracks are indeed emerging in the American right’s typically iron-clad support for the state of Israel). The new poll finds that about 6 in 10 US adults disapprove of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza, up from 45% in November 2023. Support for the war has been dwindling in Gallup’s polling for some time. In March 2024, about half of US adults disapproved of Israel’s military action in Gaza, which fell slightly as the year wore on. In a new low, only 8% of Democrats and one-quarter of independents say they now approve of Israel’s military campaign. Young adults are also much more likely to disapprove of Israel’s actions. Only about 1 in 10 adults under age 35 say they approve of Israel’s military choices in Gaza, compared with about half of those who are 55 or older. Views of Netanyahu have also grown less favorable over the past few years, with more viewing him negatively than positively in measurements taken since the war in Gaza began. About half of US adults, 52%, now have an unfavorable view of Netanyahu in the new poll, which overlapped with his recent visit to the US. Just 29% view him positively. Republicans have a much more positive view of Netanyahu than Democrats and independents do. About two-thirds of Republicans view him favorably, which is in line with last year. About 1 in 10 Democrats and 2 in 10 independents feel the same way. “This is the first time we’ve seen a majority of Americans, with an unfavorable view of him,” said Gallup senior editor Megan Brenan. “All of these questions in this poll show us basically the same story, and it’s not a good one for the Israeli government right now.” As Senate Democrats plan to continue to keep up the pressure on the Trump administration over Jeffrey Epstein this week, minority leader Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor earlier to call on the FBI to undertake a counterintelligence threat assessment of Donald Trump’s Epstein connections. Calling for a risk assessment to examine whether foreign countries might have tried to access the Epstein files and possibly exploit the information as leverage over Trump, Schumer said: Americans are right to be angry over the lack of transparency. But this isn’t just about getting to the truth. This is also every bit about our national security. Whatever may be in the Epstein files is clearly troubling enough that Donald Trump doesn’t want to touch this issue with a ten-foot pole. So it’s natural to ask: what happens if America’s adversaries use cyber-attacks or other means to access investigative materials into Jeffrey Epstein that are embarrassing – or worse – for President Trump and the people around him? What happens if Epstein materials end up in the hands of the Chinese government, or Russia, or North Korea? Unless the Epstein files are released, and made fully transparent to the public, could our adversaries use that information to blackmail someone like the president? Or other senior leaders in government? What kind of risk could that pose to our national security? He went on: National security is not – and should never be – a partisan issue. We need to do everything we can to make sure we’re protecting the US and American families every single day. This report is imperative to do just that. And there is one more thing Donald Trump could do to quell people’s anger, confusion, frustration and fears over the national security ramifications: stop running away from this issue. Tell the truth. And if there is clearly no national security risk, release the Epstein files, President Trump. The Department of Justice has asked several large California counties to provide detailed personal information of non-citizens who got on to the state voter rolls, the Guardian has learned, in an unusual request that comes as the Trump administration has asked about a dozen states to provide wide swaths of information about voters and election practices. The justice department’s voting section sent identical letters to local election officials in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego on 9 July. The request asks the officials to provide the total number of non-citizens who had their voter registrations cancelled since 2020 as well as a copy of their voter registration records, voting history, date of birth, driver’s license numbers, and the last four digits of a social security number. The department sent a similar request to Orange county last month and then sued the county after officials redacted some information. “It’s deeply troubling,” said David Becker, the executive director for the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. “It reflects a pretty shocking misunderstanding of federal law regarding list maintenance.” The request for information on non-citizens comes as the Trump administration has arrested and moved to deport thousands of immigrants. Submitting a voter registration form while ineligible to vote is a crime so non-citizens that do so could be prosecuted and potentially deported. This kind of voter fraud, however, is extremely rare. All three counties said they were reviewing the justice department’s request. The justice department did not return a request for comment. Donald Trump said that the Wall Street Journal and its billionaire owner Rupert Murdoch want to settle the president’s defamation lawsuit against the newspaper. On 18 July, Trump promptly sued the WSJ and its owners, including Murdoch, over a story alleging that Trump’s name was on a “lewd” birthday message for the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, that included a sexually suggestive drawing and a reference to shared secrets. “I’ve been treated badly by the Wall Street Journal. I would have assumed that Rupert Murdoch controls it, but, you know, maybe does, maybe doesn’t,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “They are talking to us about doing something but we’ll see what happens. Maybe they would like us to drop that, so we’ll see ... yeah, they’re having, they want to settle it,” he said, adding, “when I get treated unfairly, I do things about it.” Trump’s lawsuit called the alleged letter “fake” and said the Journal published its article to harm his reputation. In a court filing yesterday, Trump asked a US court to order a swift deposition for Murdoch. The Wall Street Journal did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Donald Trump also told reporters on Air Force One that he thinks he will have a meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping before the end of the year, but did not elaborate. Donald Trump said he would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia “ten days from today” if Moscow did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Trump, who first announced yesterday that he was cutting his initial 50-day deadline for action from Moscow, said he had not heard a response from Russia. He told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was not worried about the potential impact of Russian sanctions on the oil market or prices, saying the US would boost domestic oil production to offset any impact. Earlier today, my colleague Jakub Krupa reported that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Russia “has taken note” of president Trump’s comments. He then said that a “special military operation” – their term for their illegal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine – continues, but Russia “remains committed to the peace process to resolve the conflict around Ukraine and secure our interests” – despite deadly attacks overnight. Peskov also confirmed that there was a “slowdown” in Russian efforts to revive diplomatic relations with the US. Trump yesterday voiced his frustration with Vladimir Putin, saying: I thought we’d be able to negotiate something. Maybe that’ll still happen, but it’s very late down the process. I’m disappointed … I’m not so interested in talking any more. Ghislaine Maxwell has offered to testify before Congress but has asked lawmakers to give her immunity, along with other major conditions, according to a list of demands sent to the House oversight committee by her attorneys, seen by CNN. James Comer, who chairs the House oversight committee, subpoenaed Maxwell to testify next month. In a new letter sent to Comer today, Maxwell’s attorneys said they initially decided to invoke her fifth amendment rights, but then offered to cooperate with Congress “if a fair and safe path forward can be established”. The letter comes after Maxwell, Epstein’s accomplice who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes, asked the US supreme court overturn her conviction. And her attorneys claim “any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool”. The letter goes on: “Compounding these concerns are public comments from members of Congress that appear to have prejudged Ms. Maxwell’s credibility without even listening to what she has to say or evaluating the extensive documentation that corroborates it.” An oversight committee spokesperson rejected the idea of giving Maxwell immunity, telling CNN: The oversight committee will respond to Ms. Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony. Per CNN’s report, Maxwell’s conditions as laid out by her attorneys include: A grant of formal immunity. The interview can’t happen at the correctional facility where she’s serving her sentence. “To prepare adequately for any congressional deposition – and to ensure accuracy and fairness – we would require the Committee’s questions in advance … Surprise questioning would be both inappropriate and unproductive.” The interview would be scheduled “only after the resolution of her supreme court petition and her forthcoming habeas petition”. If the demands cannot be met, her attorneys said: “Maxwell will have no choice but to invoke her fifth amendment rights” (the right to remain silent). The letter ends with an appeal for clemency from Donald Trump for which, her attorneys say, Maxwell would be “willing and eager” to testify. Of course, in the alternative, if Ms. Maxwell were to receive clemency, she would be willing – and eager – to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C. She welcomes the opportunity to share the truth and to dispel the many misconceptions and misstatements that have plagued this case from the beginning. Donald Trump has said he and UK prime minister Keir Starmer did not discuss Britain’s plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel holds to a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution. “We never did discuss it,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One. He and Starmer held talks in Scotland yesterday where the US president was asked about the UK’s commitment to recognizing a Palestinian state. He responded: I’m not going to take a position, I don’t mind him [the prime minister] taking a position. I’m looking for getting people fed right now. Reuters reports Trump also said: “You’re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded.” On this subject, longstanding ties between US conservatives and Israel are facing strain, with growing calls for the war to end and internal rifts reshaping the right. My colleague J Oliver Conroy asks today, is the US right turning on Israel? As the Israel-Gaza war nears its two-year mark, and as images of starving people and utter devastation flood social media, cracks seem to be emerging in the American right’s typically iron-clad support for Israel. The US continues to support Israel diplomatically and militarily, and last Thursday pulled out of peace negotiations that it accused Hamas of sabotaging. And in the US Congress, only two Republicans voted for a recent amendment that would have pulled funding for missile defense systems for Israel. Yet the war’s duration and human cost, as well as recent Israeli strikes on Christian targets, have spurred modest signs of discontent on the US right. Some conservative commentators have walked back their support for Israel’s war; the US’s famously Zionist ambassador to Israel rebuked the actions of Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, and an unresolved rift over foreign intervention continues to plague the Maga world. You can read the complete analysis here: Further to my last post regarding representative Marjorie Taylor Greene becoming the first Republican member of Congress to call Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide, Steve Bannon, Trump’s influential former adviser, has told Politico: It seems that for the under-30-year-old Maga base, Israel has almost no support, and Netanyahu’s attempt to save himself politically by dragging America in deeper to another Middle East war has turned off a large swath of older Maga diehards. Now President Trump’s public repudiation of one of the central tenants of Bibi’s Gaza strategy - ‘starving’ Palestinians - will only hasten a collapse of support. Politico also notes vice-president JD Vance’s remarks in Ohio yesterday, speaking of the “heartbreaking” images from Gaza. He said: Israel’s gotta do more to let that aid in and we’ve also gotta wage war on Hamas so that those folks stop preventing food from coming into this territory. “The days of the old GOP party line on Israel [unconditional support] could be numbered,” Politico writes. Here’s Donald Trump boarding Air Force One a short time ago to return to Washington, in Lossiemouth, Scotland. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is the first Republican member of Congress to call Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide. In a lengthy post on X yesterday, she wrote: It’s the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct 7th in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza. It marks a significant break for Greene, a Trump loyalist and prominent Maga figure, with the rest of her party, who have been consistently vocal in their unconditional support for Israel. Greene has been increasingly critical of Israel. Earlier this month, she said in another statement: “Israel bombed the Catholic Church in Gaza, and that entire population is being wiped out as they continue their aggressive war in Gaza.” In yesterday’s post, the Georgia Republican rebuked her colleague Randy Fine, of Florida, who is under fire for calling the suffering of Palestinian people as part of a campaign of “Muslim terror propaganda”. “Release the hostages,” he wrote in a social media post last week. “Until then, starve away.” Greene said of Fine on X: I can only imagine how Florida’s 6th district feels now that their Representative, that they were told to vote for, openly calls for starving innocent people and children … a Jewish U.S. Representative calling for the continued starvation of innocent people and children is disgraceful. His awful statement will actually cause more antisemitism. Related: Israel committing genocide in Gaza, say Israel-based human rights groups Fine’s comments came before Donald Trump acknowledged for the first time yesterday that there is “real starvation” in Gaza. In a rare break with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who has denied that Israel is causing starvation in the region), Trump told Israel to allow “every ounce of food” into Gaza. Today my colleagues report that Gaza has passed two grim landmarks on a single day, as UN-backed hunger experts warned a “worst-case scenario of famine” was unfolding in the strip and called for “immediate action” shortly before health officials announced the death toll from Israeli attacks had passed 60,000. With more than 145,000 others injured, nearly one in 10 Palestinians who lived in Gaza two years ago has become a casualty of the war. “The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in an alert that called for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”. Survivors face a famine caused by Israel blocking food aid and “relentless conflict”, the report said. “Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.” You can follow our coverage of the crisis here: The shooter, Shane Tamura, who was identified by police as the gunman in yesterday’s shooting, worked at Caesars’ Horseshoe Center Strip Las Vegas as a surveillance department employee, according to the hotel and casino company. “Our thoughts are with the victims, their families, and all those affected by this tragic event,” Caesars said in a statement shared with NBC News. “We are cooperating with law enforcement and will not be commenting further.” NBC reports that records show a person with the name Shane Devon Tamura had a work card issued by the Nevada Private Investigators Licensing Board from 2019 to 2024. But that work card did not authorize him to carry a firearm. It is unclear what employment Tamura had held since then. The third of four victims in last night’s shooting has been identified as Julia Hyman, according to the New York Post. Hyman was killed on the 33rd floor of the office tower, where she worked for Rudin Management as an associate, reports the Post. She graduated from Cornell in 2020. The three other victims were all shot in the lobby of the building. They have been identified as NYPD officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, and the third is believed to be a security guard for the building who has not yet been named. The shooter’s intended target was the NFL offices in the building, according to NYC mayor Eric Adams. He took the wrong elevator and ended up on the 33rd floor offices of Rudin Management, where he opened fire again before shooting himself. The UJA Federation of New York, a Jewish philanthropic organization, released a statement memorializing Wesley LePatner, who was a member of the group’s board of directors. “We are devastated by the tragic loss of Wesley LePatner, a beloved member of UJA’s community and a member of our board of directors, who was killed in yesterday’s mass shooting in Midtown. Wesley was extraordinary in every way — personally, professionally, and philanthropically. An exceptional leader in the financial world, she brought thoughtfulness, vision, and compassion to everything she did. In 2023, we honored her with the Alan C. Greenberg Young Leadership Award at our Wall Street Dinner, recognizing her commitment to our community and her remarkable achievements, all the more notable as a woman in a traditionally male-dominated field. In the wake of October 7, Wesley led a solidarity mission with UJA to Israel, demonstrating her enduring commitment in Israel’s moment of heartache. She lived with courage and conviction, instilling in her two children a deep love for Judaism and the Jewish people. We mourn the loss of a life taken far too soon and extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Evan; her children; and her entire family. May Wesley’s memory be for a blessing — and a lasting source of strength and inspiration.” Several bunches of flowers are now attached to the railing of a ramp leading to the Park Avenue building’s front door, along with a yellow balloon with the words “LOVE ONE ANOTHER!!” written on it. A spokesman for audit and advisory firm KPMG said in a statement their office at 345 Park Avenue will be closed on Tuesday, reports Reuters. No KPMG employees were injured in the shooting, according to a post by chair and CEO Tim Walsh and US managing principal Atif Zaim on the company’s LinkedIn page. “Our hearts are with the victims of this horrific act and their families, as well as all of our neighbors in 345 Park. This was a terrible, tragic, and frightening event. We are incredibly grateful for the bravery of building security and law enforcement. At this time, we are not aware of any significant physical injuries to our KPMG colleagues,” the statement on LinkedIn said. New York governor Kathy Hochul is calling for Congress to pass a national assault weapons ban following yesterday’s shooting in Manhattan which killed four people. In a statement this morning, Hochul noted the suspect used an AR-15-style assault rifle, a commonly used weapon in mass shootings in the US. New York has some of the strongest gun laws in the nation. We banned assault weapons. We strengthened our Red Flag Law. We closed dangerous loopholes. But our laws only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder. The time to act is now. The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen. The shooter was a Las Vegas resident. He had appeared to have driven over three days to reach New York City. Hochul also condemned the shooting as a “horrific act of violence” and paid tribute to NYPD officer Didarul Islam. “My heart is with his loved ones, his NYPD family and every victim of this tragedy,” Hochul said. Here is my colleague Ed Pilkington’s report: An NFL employee was also injured in the shooting and was in stable condition at a hospital, according to a memo sent by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to league staff. Goodell wrote there would be “increased security presence” at the league’s offices “in the days and weeks to come”, ESPN reported. He also said employees based in New York should work remotely Tuesday or could take the day off. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a serious brain disease with no known treatment that can be caused by repeated bangs to the head from contact sports. It has been linked to aggression and dementia, and the NFL has paid an estimated $1bn to settle concussion-related lawsuits with thousands of retired players after the deaths of several high-profile players, Reuters reports. Tamura was never an NFL player, but online records show he played in high school. The note found in his wallet said his football career was cut short by his brain injury, Bloomberg News reported. The suspect, Shane Tamura, appeared to have driven to New York City from Las Vegas over three days and to have acted alone, New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters last night. He entered the skyscraper’s lobby, turned to his right and immediately shot the NYPD officer, Didarul Islam, who was assigned to the building’s security detail. Tisch said Tamura used an M4 Carbine, a semi-automatic rifle popular with civilian US gun enthusiasts modeled on a fully automatic rifle used in the military. He then shot a woman and two men in the lobby but inexplicably allowed another woman to pass him unharmed before he took the elevator to the 33rd-floor offices of Rudin Management. There he fatally shot his final victim before taking his own life, Tisch said. A widely circulated photo showed the permit issued to Tamura by the Las Vegas metropolitan police department allowing him to legally carry a concealed firearm. An additional weapon – a loaded revolver – was later recovered from the black BMW vehicle Tamura had left double-parked outside the office tower, along with a backpack and prescription medications, Tisch said. To recap, the gunman who opened fire in a Manhattan office building left a note that appeared to blame the National Football League for a brain injury, New York mayor Eric Adams has said on the airwaves this morning. The suspect, Shane Tamura, 27, brought the carnage to an end not long after it began on Monday evening by fatally shooting himself in the chest on the 33rd floor of the Park Avenue skyscraper. The building houses NFL headquarters. Adams said the preliminary investigation shows the gunman took the wrong elevator bank and, instead of getting to NFL headquarters, ended up at Rudin Management, which owns the building at 345 Park Avenue. “That is where he carried out additional shootings and took the lives of additional employees,” Adams told CBS this morning. A security staffer remained hospitalized in critical condition, Adams said. The gunman shot a woman in the lobby, then a security guard who was hiding behind the counter, he said. Four people, including the security guard – an off-duty New York City police officer – and a Blackstone real estate executive, were killed. In what Adams called an “uncanny episode”, the gunman allowed a woman to walk past him without shooting before taking the elevator up to Rudin and discharging multiple rounds there. The NYPD officer has been identified as Didarul Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh and a father of two whose wife is pregnant. He was working off-hours as a security guard at the time. Adams described him as a “true blue hero”. Blackstone released a statement identifying the executive as Wesley LePatner. “Words cannot express the devastation we feel,” the statement read. Here’s a little more on the note left by the shooter, in which he claimed he had been suffering from CTE – the degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports like football – and said his brain should be studied after he died, two people familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. Donald Trump has condemned the “senseless act of violence” in which four people were killed in the Manhattan office shooting. “I have been briefed on the tragic shooting that took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence.” “My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including the NYPD Officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice,” he added. The president will return to the US from Scotland tonight. The New York Times reports that the mayor, Eric Adams, also said on Good Day New York that the shooter had intended to go to the NFL offices on the lower floors of 345 Park Avenue but “appeared to have gone to the wrong floor”. “There are two different elevator banks,” Adams said. “Some banks don’t go to every floor. He appeared to have gone to the wrong bank, and he ended up on the floor of Rudin Management.” The gunman who opened fire in a Manhattan office building left a note that appeared to blame the National Football League for his brain injury, New York mayor Eric Adams said. Two officials familiar with the matter previously told NBC News that in the note found at the shooting scene, the suspect wondered about CTE – a brain condition caused by head trauma – as a possible cause of his mental illness. “He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,” Adams said in an interview with CBS’s “This Morning”. The skyscraper where the shooting occurred Monday evening houses the NFL headquarters. In an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”, Adams was asked about a possible link, noting that while the suspect, Shane Tamura, didn’t play college football, he did play at his California high school. “He talked about CTE. He was not an NFL player. We have reason to believe that he was focused on the NFL agency that was located in the building, and we’re going to continue to investigate with our federal partners to ensure that we can find a reason and identify any other weapons,” Adams responded. Investment giant Blackstone Inc said that a senior executive was among the people killed when a gunman, carrying an assault rifle, walked into the lobby of a midtown Manhattan office building and opened fire on Monday. “We are heartbroken to share that our colleague, Wesley LePatner, was among those who lost their lives in the tragic incident at 345 Park Avenue. Words cannot express the devastation we feel,” the company said in a statement. LePatner was a senior managing director at the firm and global head of core+ real estate and the chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT), the firm added. Here are some pictures from the ribbon-cutting ceremony during the opening of Donald Trump’s new golf course, the Trump International Golf Links, in Balmedie earlier. This is the final day of his five-day visit to Scotland. Twenty-one Senate Democrats are demanding Donald Trump immediately cut funding to a controversial Gaza aid organization they say has resulted in the killings of more than 700 civilians seeking food and violated decades of humanitarian law. The letter, led by senators Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Peter Welch of Vermont, comes as international criticism mounts over the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s operations, arguing that its model “shatters well-established norms that have governed distribution of humanitarian aid since the ratification of the Geneva conventions in 1949” by blurring the lines between aid delivery and military security operations. “According to reports and eyewitness accounts, civilians have been fired at by tanks, drones, and helicopters, as well as soldiers on the ground, as they attempt to get food and humanitarian supplies,” the senators wrote. The Trump administration authorized a $30m grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in late June, with $7m already disbursed according to documents seen by the Guardian. The organization, which is backed by both Israeli and US interests, has been given preferential access to operate in Gaza through coordination with the Israeli military and private US security contractors. However, the rollout of the new scheme has been marked by death and destruction from the outset. Jake Wood, the founding executive director and former US marine, resigned on 25 May, saying: “It is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon.” Boston Consulting Group, the US firm handling some of the foundation’s logistics, also withdrew shortly after. The US Department of Justice is facing a federal lawsuit for refusing to release a legal memorandum that reportedly cleared the way for Donald Trump’s acceptance of a $400m luxury aircraft from Qatar’s government. The Freedom of the Press Foundation, represented by the watchdog group American Oversight, filed the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) lawsuit in Washington DC’s federal district court after the justice department failed to produce the document despite granting expedited processing more than two months ago. The president’s “deal to take a $400m luxury jet from a foreign government deserves full public scrutiny – not a stiff-arm from the Department of Justice”, American Oversight’s executive director, Chioma Chukwu, said in a press release. “This is precisely the kind of corrupt arrangement that public records laws are designed to expose.” The case revisits Trump’s decision to accept the extravagant foreign gift: a luxury Boeing 747-8 jetliner dubbed a “palace in the sky”. Before the president’s frustrated base would start to call for the release of all Jeffrey Epstein files, followed by renewed scrutiny of the convicted sex offender’s friendship with Trump, what came to be known as “Qatar-gate” was one of the first symbols of the new administration that even stalwart Trump allies shook their heads at when the deal first emerged in May. At the time, the US senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, warned the aircraft “poses significant espionage and surveillance problems”. The senator Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, said she would “be checking for bugs”. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, also a Republican, called accepting foreign gifts “never a good practice” that “threatens intelligence and national security”. The Democratic US House member Ritchie Torres called it a “flying grift” that violated the constitution’s emoluments clause prohibiting federal officials from accepting valuable foreign presents without congressional approval. The justice department filed a misconduct complaint on Monday against US district court chief judge James Boasberg, a prominent Washington, DC, judge who has drawn president Donald Trump’s ire, US attorney general Pam Bondi said on X. Boasberg said in April that the Trump administration appeared to have acted “in bad faith” when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights on 15 March at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess the legality of the effort. “Today at my direction, @TheJusticeDept filed a misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg for making improper public comments about President Trump and his Administration,” Bondi said, without specifying which comments was she referring to. Donald Trump has said he is “working together” with Israel “to try and get things straightened out” in Gaza amid warnings of severe mass starvation in the enclave. After opening his new golf course in Menie, Aberdeenshire, a reporter from the crowd asked the US president “what will you say next to Benjamin Netanyahu”, the prime minister of Israel. “We’re working together to try and get things straightened out,” Trump said. Earlier during his speech at the course, the US leader said he would fly back to the Washington to “put out fires all over the world”. Donald Trump’s administration has initiated a probe into Duke University and the Duke Law Journal over allegations of race-related discrimination, making it the latest American university to face the threat of cuts to federal funding. The government said on Monday it will probe whether the Duke Law Journal’s selection of its editors gives preferences to candidates from minority communities. “This investigation is based on recent reporting alleging that Duke University discriminates on the bases of race, color, and/or national origin by using these factors to select law journal members,” the Education Department said in a statement. US education secretary Linda McMahon and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr sent a letter to the university’s leadership alleging what the government called “the use of race preferences in Duke’s hiring, admissions, and scholarship decisions.” The letter urged the university to review its policies and create a panel “with delegated authority from Duke’s Board of Trustees to enable Duke and the federal government to move quickly toward a mutual resolution of Duke’s alleged civil rights violations.” Duke had no immediate comment, Reuters reported. Rights advocates have raised free speech and academic freedom concerns over the Trump administration’s attempted crackdown against universities. Donald Trump’s strategy of imposing sweeping tariffs on America’s main trading partners will face a major test in the US courts on Thursday, four days after the president hailed the “powerful deal” reached with the EU and just hours before a new round of punishing import duties is set to come into effect. Trump has underpinned his tariff policy with an emergency power that is now being challenged as unlawful in the federal courts. On Thursday the US court of appeals for the federal circuit will hear oral arguments in the case, VOS Selections v Trump. A group of small business owners are suing the US president on grounds that he lacks legal authority from Congress to impose severe tariffs that could damage their bottom line. The Trump administration has invoked a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), claiming that various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners and the scourge of fentanyl trafficking – demand urgent action. But the plaintiffs have countered that the IEEPA does not give the president the power to impose tariffs, and has never been used in such a way in its almost half a century on the statute books. The case has the potential to derail Trump’s most significant tariff deals and negotiations, which he has made a centrepiece of his second presidency. Given how much is riding on it, the suit is likely eventually to be settled by the US supreme court under its current 6-3 supermajority of hard-right justices. In the short term, the challenge under the IEEPA looms as a black cloud over Trump’s desire to claim victory on the tariff front, as his controversial strategy of slapping hefty import duties on major trading partners continues to roil global trade and markets. On Sunday, Trump struck a deal at his golf club in Scotland with the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, that will see 15% import tariffs on most EU goods entering the US. Then on Friday, a day after the appeals court hears oral arguments, Trump’s latest round of potentially destabilizing import duties is set to kick in. The targeted countries include some of the biggest suppliers of US imports, including Canada and Mexico. Donald Trump’s timeline for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine has sped up, the president said while visiting Nato ally Great Britain on Monday. “I’m going to make a new deadline of about 10, 10 or 12 days from today,” Trump said in response to a question while sitting with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. “There’s no reason in waiting. There’s no reason in waiting. It’s 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don’t see any progress being made.” Russian and Ukrainian diplomats met in Istanbul last week, agreeing on little more than a prisoner exchange. Ukraine proposed a summit by the end of August between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but Russia’s reply was that such a meeting would only be appropriate if it were to sign an agreement. The meeting was the third negotiation in Istanbul. Putin has not attended any of the talks, despite Trump’s exhortations. The Trump administration must continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics for Medicaid-funded services, a federal judge ruled on Monday, in an escalating legal war between the reproductive health giant and the White House over Republican efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood. Days after Donald Trump signed his sweeping tax bill, Planned Parenthood sued over a provision in the bill that ended Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, such as Planned Parenthood. The new court order, from US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston, will protect Medicaid funding for all Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide while litigation in the case continues. The order also replaces and expands a previous edict handed down by Talwani, which initially granted a preliminary injunction specifically blocking the government from cutting Medicaid payments only to Planned Parenthood affiliates that did not provide abortions or did not receive at least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in a given year. “Patients are likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or unavailable,” Talwani wrote in her Monday order. “In particular, restricting members’ ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated STIs.” More than 80 million people rely on Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people. It is already illegal to use Medicaid to pay for most abortions, but Planned Parenthood clinics – which treat a disproportionate number of people who use Medicaid – rely on the program to reimburse it for services such as birth control, STI tests and cancer screenings. Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was not seeking a summit with Chinese president Xi Jinping, but added that he may visit China at Xi’s invitation, which Trump said had been extended. “I may go to China, but it would only be at the invitation of President Xi, which has been extended. Otherwise, no interest!,” Trump said on Truth Social. Aides to Trump and Xi have discussed a potential meeting between the leaders during a trip by the US president to Asia later this year, sources previously told Reuters. North Korea said on Tuesday the United States must accept that reality has changed since the countries’ summit meetings in the past, and no future dialogue would end its nuclear program, state media KCNA reported. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who is believed to speak for her brother, said she conceded that the personal relationship between Kim and US president Donald Trump “is not bad.” But if Washington intended to use a personal relationship as a way to end the North’s nuclear weapons program, the effort would only be the subject of “mockery,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by KCNA. “If the US fails to accept the changed reality and persists in the failed past, the DPRK-US meeting will remain as a ‘hope’ of the US side,” she said, referring to North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. North Korea’s capabilities as a nuclear weapons state and the geopolitical environment have radically changed since Kim and Trump held talks three times during the US president’s first term, she said. “Any attempt to deny the position of the DPRK as a nuclear weapons state ... will be thoroughly rejected,” she said. Top US and Chinese economic officials arrived on Tuesday at the venue where they are conducting their latest bilateral round of trade negotiations, this time held in Stockholm, after previous rounds in London and Geneva. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said on Tuesday the trade agreement with the US guaranteed Japan would always get the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals out of all the pacts negotiated by Washington. “If a third country agrees with the United States on lower rates on chips and pharmaceuticals, the same rates would be applied to Japan,” he told a news conference. Donald Trump has arrived at the opening ceremony for his new golf course in Aberdeenshire, arriving to the tune of bagpipes at the event at his course in Menie. He thanked his son Eric, who he said had “worked so hard” on creating the New Course at the resort. The president also thanked John Swinney, who was among the assembled audience. Eric Trump had earlier said he and the Trump International team had created an “amazing masterpiece” at the New Course. US House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed his concern over the “horrific shooting”, and said he was “praying hard” for the NYPD officer. “May God watch over our city during this challenging moment,” Jeffries wrote in a post. A large police presence converged on the area around the tower, according to Reuters journalists near the scene. “I just saw a lot of commotion and cops and people screaming,” said Russ McGee, a 31-year-old sports bettor who was working out in a gym adjacent to the skyscraper, told Reuters in an interview near the scene. The office building at 345 Park Avenue occupies an entire city block and houses the corporate offices for the National Football League and the headquarters of investment firm Blackstone. It also holds offices for JP Morgan Chase. According to an ESPN reporter, Jeff Darlington, an NFL security alert was sent to employees: “Do not exit the building. Secure your location and hide until law enforcement clears your floor. Please switch phones to silent.” This shooting is the 254th mass shooting in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks gun-related violence, who defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, are killed or injured by firearms. Donald Trump has met with the Scottish first minister John Swinney at his Aberdeenshire golf club. The president is opening a second course at his Menie Estate property on Tuesday and it is understood the first minister met with Trump shortly before the ceremony. The leaders spoke for around 15 minutes, before posing together for pictures in front of a US flag and the saltire of Scotland ahead of the opening of a second course at the president’s golf club in Aberdeenshire. Swinney has previously said he would push the president on an exemption to tariffs for Scotch whisky and raise the situation in Gaza, which also came up in the meeting between Trump and prime minister Keir Starmer on Monday. Meanwhile, Trump was spotted on the driving range of his golf club during a delay in the opening ceremony for a new course. Trump could be seen hitting shots from the driving range just yards where the first tee of the new course, where he is expected to be the first to tee off. President Donald Trump is opening a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family’s luxury properties and playing golf. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr, are cutting the ceremonial ribbon and playing the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland, AP reported. The overseas jaunt let Trump escape Washington’s sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein. It was mostly built around golf – and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on 13 August, adding to a lengthy list of ways Trump has used the White House to promote his brand. Billing itself the “Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,” the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday, and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers on to the correct road. Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of Trump’s arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing golf shoes, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people were watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with the news that a gunman killed four people at a Manhattan skyscraper that houses the headquarters of the NFL and the offices of several major financial firms before turning the gun on himself, New York officials have said. An NYPD officer identified as Didarul Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh and a father of two whose wife is pregnant, was among those killed. He was working off-hours as a security guard at the time, New York mayor Eric Adams told reporters, describing him as a “true blue hero”. Authorities offered few details about the three other victims killed by the suspect – two men and a woman. A third male was gravely wounded by the gunfire and was “fighting for his life” in a nearby hospital, the mayor said. Jessica Tisch, the New York City police commissioner, confirmed that “the lone shooter has been neutralized”. New York police also said the shooter acted alone and was dead. Tisch said the gunman, identified as Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental illness, had driven cross-country to New York in recent days. The shooting spree in the evening rush hour began in the lobby of the Park Avenue tower in Midtown Manhattan. Tisch said that surveillance videos showed the gunman exiting a double-parked Black BMW between 51st and 52nd street on Park Avenue. Read our full report here: In other developments this morning: Ghislaine Maxwell asked the supreme court to overturn her conviction for taking part in and facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes, arguing that a non-prosecution agreement with the late sex offender struck by federal prosecutors in Florida in 2008 should have barred any of his co-conspirators from prosecution as well. Donald Trump said that he did indeed bar Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club for “inappropriate” behavior. But the president explained that what was inappropriate was not, as his aides have suggested, doing something lewd or illegal, but hiring away staff from the club. An Israeli settler who was sanctioned by Joe Biden as a violent extremist, but removed from the sanctions list by Trump, was arrested in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday after the fatal shooting of a Palestinian activist. The Palestinian man who was killed was denied entry to the United States last month when he arrived in San Francisco for a series of planned talks sponsored by faith groups, including a progressive Jewish synagogue. The US justice department filed a misconduct complaint against a federal judge who has clashed with the administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador over private comments first reported by a far-right publication.
