  The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has called for a meeting with Rachel Reeves
  to discuss changes to Labour’s inheritance tax reforms after fresh evidence
  from tax experts that the planned changes may not achieve their stated goal of
  removing the incentive for rich people to shelter their wealth from tax by
  buying up farmland. The chancellor’s plan, which comes into force next April,
  “largely protects family farms whilst limiting claims by the wealthiest
  estates”, according to a report by researchers at the Centre for the Analysis
  of Taxation (CenTax), which has proposed amendments to the inheritance tax
  changes. However, Dr Andy Summers, the director of CenTax and an associate
  professor at the London School of Economics, said: “The relief could be better
  targeted to reduce its use for tax planning and further extend protection for
  businesses, including farms.” The chancellor’s announcement in last October’s
  budget that she was bringing farms and other agricultural property into
  inheritance tax rules to raise money for public services and close a tax
  loophole exploited by some wealthy landowners sparked uproar. Farmers
  responded with large-scale protests and drowned out ministers’ speeches with
  tractor horns after Reeves said she was ending a decades-long exemption for
  farms and would make inheritors pay 20% of the value of agricultural and
  business property above £1m. In an average year, the vast majority (86%) of
  farm estates affected by the inheritance tax changes could pay the entire tax
  bill using non-farm assets, the CenTax analysis found, leaving 70 estates out
  of 1,560 farms which could not. The NFU has repeatedly voiced its opposition,
  warning of threats to the UK’s family farms and the nation’s food security.
  However, the NFU’s president, Tom Bradshaw, told the Guardian he welcomed the
  CenTax report and called on the chancellor and her officials to discuss the
  findings before April. “This report gives us an opportunity to sit around the
  table and try to adjust the recommendations that have been made so far to
  target them better and remove the worst of the impact from the working family
  farms,” he said. “I really worry about the period through the autumn and the
  winter ahead of April, and we’ve got to try to get changes in place that
  mitigate the impact, but still meet Treasury requirements.” CenTax’s analysis
  also found that landowners are less likely to be affected by the tax reforms
  than working farmers, as they represent almost two-thirds (64%) of all farm
  estates but only 42% of affected farm estates. It also found that
  owner-farmers account for 17% of all farm estates, but more than a third (37%)
  of affected farm estates. Bradshaw said this showed wealthy landowners “can
  afford to pay the tax without having to sell assets, whereas a much greater
  percentage of family farms will have to sell assets or sell part of the farm
  to pay the inheritance tax”. “If it forces the sale of some farmland, it may
  well mean that the farm is no longer viable, it will reduce the ability to
  continue producing food,” he said. It came as Reeves said decisions around
  taxes would not be announced until the autumn budget, after the Guardian
  reported that she was looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax
  amid growing pressure on the UK’s finances. The chancellor told reporters on
  Thursday that decisions would be made “in the round” and the key focus of the
  budget would be to “boost productivity and growth and prosperity all across
  the country”.
