  The people of Gaza did not need this week’s official confirmation from
  UN-backed hunger experts that the “worst-case scenario of famine” was
  unfolding there. For months they have watched as their children waste away.
  “All my children have lost nearly half of their body weight,” said Jamil
  Mughari, a 38-year-old from Maghazi in central Gaza. “My daughter, who is five
  years old, now weighs only 11kg. My son Mohammad has become just skin and
  bones. All my children are like this. “I myself used to weigh 85kg, and now
  I’m down to 55.” He was struggling to sustain the strength required to find
  food for his family. “Sometimes, while walking in the street, I feel dizzy and
  that I’m about to collapse, but I force myself to stay upright. I also
  sometimes experience shivering,” he said. Over the course of the week, Gaza
  passed two appalling milestones. The official Palestinian death toll passed
  60,000, although the real figure, including those buried under the rubble from
  Israeli airstrikes, is likely to be far higher. The human cost is likely to
  continue to rise steeply as starvation catches up with bombs and gunfire as an
  indiscriminate killer. On Tuesday, the Integrated Food Security Phase
  Classification (IPC), a panel of experts from the UN and other aid
  organisations, which had long warned of the threat of famine, confirmed that
  the line had been crossed. “The worst-case scenario of famine is currently
  playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the IPC said, as it called for a ceasefire to
  prevent further “catastrophic human suffering”. The 2.2 million people of Gaza
  have long been experts in hunger, forced to scavenge for food each day in the
  face of Israel’s deliberate and severe restrictions to aid deliveries. Mughari
  said that food was almost nonexistent: “We can go for a week or two without
  any flour. Sometimes we only have one meal a day, which is lentils, and
  sometimes we find nothing at all to eat – we spend the day drinking water just
  to feel full.” His family has had to move seven times since the war began,
  forced to flee repeated Israeli offensives. But there was no way to escape the
  hunger that now grips the entire territory. “Sometimes we get lentils from
  donations or charitable people, or we borrow some money to buy them, that’s
  it,” he said. “We don’t receive any food aid from soup kitchens; those are
  only for certain camps, in small quantities. “They [Israelis] spread news
  about aid coming in, but only the strong and those with weapons seize the
  trucks and sell the goods at extremely high prices. How can the poor afford to
  buy them at such prices?” The four food distribution sites across Gaza run by
  the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation are open for only a few minutes a day,
  leading to huge crowds of desperate people, who have come under Israeli fire
  while seeking humanitarian assistance, leading to mass casualties. Mansoura
  Fadl al-Helou, a 58-year-old widow, is too frail to go to the distribution
  points and refuses to let her son go, for fear he would not come back alive.
  “The situation there is terrible and very dangerous. The worst part is the
  chaos among the men – people pushing and throwing each other to the ground,”
  she said. “Only my one son is here, but I always stop him from going near the
  aid trucks because of the danger posed by the army. I couldn’t bear to see him
  come back to me as a martyr.” Mughari has undergone open-heart surgery and all
  his children are under 12. Even if they wanted to risk their lives for the
  chance of finding food, they are unable to. “I try to remain steadfast so I
  can provide my children with anything to eat,” he said. “We have sent many
  messages to the world, but no one has moved. We no longer know what to say.
  All I can tell the world is that we are dying slowly, save us from this
  tragedy.” Among the horrors the Israel-Gaza war has brought to its people, the
  torture of parents seeing their children starve and being powerless to save
  them is surely one of the worst. “My youngest daughter is 14 years old, and
  her ribcage bones are clearly visible due to extreme weakness and
  malnutrition,” said Abu al-Abed, a father from Deir al-Balah. “I have four
  daughters and three sons. They suffer from dizziness and fatigue because of
  the lack of food. If I, their father, feel this way, how much worse must it be
  for them?” He said they did not receive any aid and that the food market was
  expensive and they could afford to buy only a little there. “The prices are
  extremely high; they haven’t reached such levels of inflation even in European
  countries. And here in Gaza, there is no source of income at all. “There used
  to be soup kitchens in the area, but now they no longer exist. There are no
  places that provide free food any more. He said he no longer believed the
  world had any sense of responsibility. “For years, they boasted about human
  rights and the protection of lives. What I see now is that all of this was a
  lie, we were deceived by these slogans. “If we had asked them to protect the
  rights of animals in Gaza, they would have responded immediately and done the
  impossible. But when it comes to the rights of the Palestinian people, no one
  remembers us or feels for us, not the Arabs, not the Muslims, not the
  Christians, no one.” The official IPC recognition of what the people of Gaza
  knew only too well – that they are starving – brought some faint hope that the
  outside world would finally stir itself to act, though long experience did not
  bring much confidence that would happen. Al-Helou said: “We have been
  suffering from this famine for a long time, and no one has acted. I hope that
  through this message, the world will finally move to help us and save us from
  this slow death.” The news of the UK’s pledge to recognise Palestine in
  September, barring a ceasefire and a fundamental change in direction from
  Israel, impressed her even less. “I don’t know what would change if the
  British government recognises the state of Palestine. What kind of state has
  no sovereignty, no right to self-defence?” she asked. “It’s a good step to
  recognise us and the state of Palestine, but it should be a real recognition –
  not symbolic. A state with real rights, real sovereignty, and a people with
  rights like any other nation.” • The caption to the picture accompanying this
  article was amended on 21 August 2025 to include reference to the child, who
  is severely malnourished, also having a pre-existing health condition.
