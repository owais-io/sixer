  A neo-Nazi was among speakers to address the crowd at a tense anti-immigration
  protest in Melbourne, as similar demonstrations under the banner March for
  Australia took place in state and territory capitals across the country on
  Sunday. While the protests were condemned as hateful by the federal
  government, some politicians attended, including the One Nation leader,
  Pauline Hanson, and party member Senator Malcolm Roberts in Canberra and the
  federal MP Bob Katter in Townsville. The marches were promoted by neo-Nazis,
  as well as anti-lockdown figures who gained prominence during the pandemic,
  and other fringe groups but no group publicly claimed responsibility for
  organising the protests. In Melbourne protesters gathered outside Flinders
  Street station with many carrying Australian flags, along with placards
  bearing anti-immigration slogans. A counter-protest also assembled in front of
  the State Library of Victoria, with the weekly pro-Palestine rally merging
  with an antifascist counter-demonstration to protest against the March for
  Australia. Victoria police blocked off Flinders and Swanston streets to the
  north of the intersection, in an apparent attempt to keep two rallies apart,
  but they eventually met at the corner of Collins and Elizabeth streets with a
  barrier of police between them, three rows deep, including officers on
  horseback. A volatile verbal confrontation ensued, with a bottle thrown from
  the anti-immigration protest smashing at the feet of the antifascist
  demonstrators, and an open can of beer flying over the police line towards the
  anti-immigration march. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The antifascist
  demonstrators were then pushed back by police in riot gear, who pepper-sprayed
  approximately a dozen protesters at the front of the crowd. The
  anti-immigration rally eventually reached state parliament, where protesters
  were addressed by speakers, including the neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell, who gave a
  speech claiming “his men” had led the march, and saying: “If we do not stop
  immigration, then our death is certain.” A man with a microphone whom Guardian
  Australia could not identify told the crowd: “Australians are sick and tired
  of the rising tide of mass immigration in this country”. He led a chant of
  “Albo must go”, followed by “Aussie Aussie Aussie”, which the crowd bellowed
  in unison. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, had earlier condemned those
  who “walk with Nazis” and expressed concern about the anti-immigration protest
  while attending a multicultural gala on Saturday night. “No one who has ever
  tried to divide this country has ever succeeded,” she said. “Because the
  promise of multiculturalism is so much stronger.” In a statement, Victoria
  police said six people were arrested on charges including assault police,
  behave in a riotous manner, attempted robbery, assault, and resist police.
  They said two officers were injured after being struck by bottles thrown at
  them, but did not require hospitalisation. Police said they estimated 5,000
  people participated in the Melbourne rally and counter-protest. “Officers were
  required to form many lines between the different groups to protect the safety
  of all involved, prevent breaches of the peace and prevent physical violence,”
  the statement said. “Police also had to use a range of tactical options
  including OC spray, baton rounds and public order munitions to prevent
  violence between protestors, some of whom were intent on creating conflict and
  violence. “There is absolutely no place for any of this violent and disruptive
  behaviour in Victoria and the priority for police was to separate opposing
  groups and prevent breaches of the peace.” In Sydney, New South Wales police
  deployed hundreds of officers at the annual marathon, a weekly pro-Palestine
  rally and the anti-immigration march, all in different parts of the city. In
  Canberra a crowd of what appeared to be a few hundred gathered and chanted on
  the edge of Lake Burley Griffin with a view of Parliament House across the
  lake, waving Australian flags and wearing them as capes. Hanson and Roberts
  were in attendance;Roberts was seen speaking with a microphone. A smaller
  counter-rally of counter-protesters were kept separated across a road by
  police, with officers forming a perimeter to keep the groups apart. In
  Brisbane, police reported little trouble as a group of a few thousand
  flag-draped protesters played Redgum on the march between the Roma Street
  parklands and the city botanical gardens. They were confronted briefly at Roma
  Street by a group of a counter-protesters. One video shows Uncle Wayne
  Wharton, a Brisbane First Nations activist, telling protesters: “You invaded
  this country, you stole the land.” Some protesters in both Brisbane and
  Adelaide were seen expressing solidarity with alleged Porepunkah police killer
  Dezi Freeman. In Brisbane a woman repeatedly yelled “I stand with Dezi” as
  police walked by. She was holding a sign that said “I identify as sovereign”.
  In Adelaide a man held a placard with an image of the fugitive at the march
  from Rundle Park. It came after Freeman’s wife, Amalia Freeman, released a
  statement on Sunday pleading with her husband to surrender to police and
  expressing “deep sorrow” over the fatal shooting of two officers on Tuesday.
  Ahead of the March for Australia rallies, federal opposition leader, Sussan
  Ley, released a video on social media on Saturday evening saying: “There is no
  place for violence, racism or intimidation. Whether incited from afar or
  stirred up here, we cannot let hatred and fear tear at our social cohesion.”
  The federal Labor minister Murray Watt denounced the march on Sunday morning,
  telling Sky News: “We absolutely condemn the March for Australia rally that’s
  going on today; it’s not about increasing social harmony. “We don’t support
  rallies like this that are about spreading hate and that are about dividing
  our community.” The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, told the ABC’s
  Insiders program on Sunday morning that he believed there would be people
  there “of goodwill who want to change policies” but warned them to be careful
  of the company they keep. “I’ve seen some of the material for that particular
  protest and I’m really concerned about the anti-Indian sentiment that is being
  expressed and some of the antisemitic undertones of some of those protests,”
  he said. – additional reporting by Andrew Messenger, Ben Smee, Josh Butler and
