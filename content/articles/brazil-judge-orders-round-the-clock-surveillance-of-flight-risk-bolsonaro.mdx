  Jair Bolsonaro must be under constant police surveillance, a supreme court
  justice has ruled, to prevent Brazil’s former president from fleeing days
  before the start of the trial that could see him jailed for more than 40
  years. The far-right leader has been wearing an electronic ankle tag since
  mid-July and has been under house arrest since early August. But last Monday,
  the prosecutor general asked the supreme court to tighten surveillance of the
  70-year-old, after federal police reported he had even drafted a request for
  political asylum in Argentina. In Tuesday’s ruling, Justice Alexandre de
  Moraes agreed there was a “risk of flight” and ordered police to monitor
  Bolsonaro’s Brasília mansion 24 hours a day. Moraes said officers should be
  stationed “discreetly”, without entering the former president’s home or
  disturbing the neighbourhood. The trial, in which the far-right leader and
  seven of his closest aides – including high-ranking military officers – are
  accused of leading an attempted coup to overturn the result of the 2022
  election, is scheduled to begin next Tuesday. While Bolsonaro denies the
  charges, many legal experts argue the evidence against him makes conviction
  and a severe sentence all but certain. Running in parallel at the supreme
  court is another case in which Bolsonaro and his son, the congressman Eduardo
  Bolsonaro, are under investigation for trying to obstruct the proceedings and
  pressure the justices into acquitting the former president. It was in this
  case that Moraes first ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and
  later placed him under house arrest, arguing that the former president was
  defying court orders – such as to stay away from social media. In Tuesday’s
  ruling, Moraes wrote that Eduardo’s activity was “intensifying” as the trial
  approaches, and that his “incessant actions, including while based abroad,
  indicate the possibility of a risk of flight on the part of Bolsonaro”. Last
  week, federal police said they had found a document on Bolsonaro’s mobile
  phone, dated February 2024, containing a draft request for political asylum
  addressed to Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. A prominent congressman from
  the leftwing Workers’ party of the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da
  Silva, also approached federal police saying he had information that Bolsonaro
  was planning to seek asylum at the US embassy, which is located near his
  mansion. Eduardo Bolsonaro has been in the US since February and has boasted
  of being responsible for persuading the US president, Donald Trump, to impose
  50% tariffs on Brazil in retaliation for the case brought against Bolsonaro.
  The pressure has also led to US sanctions being imposed on the justices
  handling the case – most notably against Moraes, who was hit with Magnitsky
  measures normally reserved for perpetrators of serious human rights abuses.
  Also on Tuesday, Lula said Trump was “acting as if he had been elected emperor
  of the world” and called Eduardo a “traitor to the homeland”.
