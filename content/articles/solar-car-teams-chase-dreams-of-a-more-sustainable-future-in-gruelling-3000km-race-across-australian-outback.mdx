  Solar car teams chase ‘dreams of a more sustainable future’ in gruelling
  3,000km race across Australian outback

  Zipping through the Australian outback this weekend is a red car looking more
  race boat than sedan and which travels at highway speeds using about the same
  amount of power it takes to boil a kettle. When and if this futuristic looking
  craft – the Unlimited 6.0 – crosses the finish line for the Bridgestone World
  Solar Challenge in Adelaide, its team from Western Sydney University will
  probably celebrate with something a bit stiffer than a cup of tea. Among the
  messages of support written on the vehicle’s solar panels for the engineering
  students trying to develop breakthroughs in solar car design, is one that
  reads: “get this man a beer”. No doubt the team will deserve a cold drink
  after a gruelling 3,000km race from Darwin across some of the world’s harshest
  and most remote terrain. But it won’t be all blokes who will be celebrating.
  Returning for her second race, veteran Micah Honan has taken on the role of
  electrical lead – one of added significance in 2025 with a new design
  challenge for the race of ensuring the car runs efficiently with reduced
  sunlight – this year’s event is being held in winter for the first time.
  “There are many solutions for a complicated problem, and everyone solves it a
  bit differently,” Honan said. “I love learning how and why something works, or
  how and why it doesn’t. Engineering is not just a field of study, but a
  mindset.” The Western Sydney University team is one of 34 cars from 17
  countries preparing to race their sun-powered vehicles across the outback in a
  test of innovative technology that may drive the solar-powered cars of
  tomorrow. The twice-yearly event began in 1987 and attracts an online audience
  of millions of people, who watch the race of solar-powered cars designed,
  engineered and built at universities and schools in Australia and overseas.
  After the teams leave Darwin they must travel as far as they can until 5pm
  each day, when they make camp in the desert. Sign up: au breaking news email
  Event ambassador Chris Selwood said designing and building a solar car to
  travel 3,000km, qualifying for the race, then making it to the start was “an
  incredible achievement for those with dreams of a more sustainable future”.
  “Safety for everyone is paramount and that’s one area that can’t be
  compromised,” he said in a statement. Teams face extreme heat, vast open
  desert stretches and varied terrain in three classes: challenger, cruiser and
  explorer. The cruiser class was created to encourage “green to the mainstream”
  concept cars fitted with innovative, sustainable and potentially practical
  features that could find their way into real-world design. Driver-only
  challenger class cars must travel 3,000km on the power of sunshine, while
  cruisers carry a passenger and in addition to solar power are allowed to
  charge from external sources after 5pm each day. The explorer class provides
  an even broader platform to showcase prospective ideas, technology and
  renewables. Overseas entrants this year include teams from Germany, Sweden,
  Italy, the Netherlands, Estonia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US.
