  The US politics liveblog is closing but you can continue to follow live
  coverage of the Trump tariffs news on a new liveblog here. Here are the latest
  developments: Donald Trump signed an executive order to increase tariffs on
  Canadian goods imported to the US from 25% to 35%, hours after he suggested
  that a trade deal would be hampered by Canada’s decision to recognize
  Palestine as a state. Trump revised the global tariffs he announced, and then
  paused, in April, to impose a minimum 10% import tax on goods from across the
  globe, with higher rates on 92 nations listed in an annex. The rates take
  effect in 7 days. Joe Biden gave a 20-minute address to an association of
  Black lawyers, and tore into Trump, saying that the rule of law was at threat
  “under the pressure we’re under now with this guy we have as president”. A
  legal review board recommended that Jeffrey Clark, a lawyer who works in the
  White House Office of Management and Budget, should lose his license to
  practice law over his role in Trump’s effort to overturn his 2020 election
  loss. A civil rights arm of the health department referred Harvard University
  to the department of justice over allegations that Jewish students were
  discriminated against during protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. The former
  president, Joe Biden, just spoke in Chicago at a gala to celebrate the 100th
  anniversary of the founding of the National Bar Association, the nation’s
  oldest and largest national association of predominantly Black lawyers, judges
  and law students. The 82-year-old, whose mental competency was called into
  question after a disastrous debate performance last year, leading him to end
  his re-election bid, spoke fluently and with energy for the most part, if
  occasionally too quickly, as if determined to assuage the concerns that are
  still the subject of investigations by the Republican congress. In a 20-minute
  address, streamed live by Fox News, Biden offered an impassioned defense of
  the judges he nominated to the federal bench as president, and of the rule of
  law itself. “Judges matter, courts matter, the law matters and the
  constitution matters” he said, his voice rising. “I think a lot of Americans
  are starting to realize that, under the pressure we’re under now with this guy
  we have as president”. As the crowd reacted to that comment on Trump, Biden
  shook his head and added: “Oh get ready folks, this is just starting”. After
  reciting his familiar claim to have been inspired by the civl rights movement
  to become a public defender before entering politics, Biden criticized Donald
  Trump, without naming him, for disregarding the law. The executive branch, he
  said, “seems to be doing its best to dismantle the constitution”. He added,
  “and they’re doing it all too often with the help of a congress that is just
  sitting on the sidelines, and enabled by the highest court in the nation”. In
  a break from his prepared remarks, Biden added, of the supreme court, “the
  rulings they’ve made, my God.” Biden also accused the Trump administration of
  working to erase “all the gains we’ve made” and “to erase justice itself”.
  Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday modifying the tariff rates
  he first announced in April ahead of a Friday deadline for the new rates on
  imported goods to go into effect. The order states that goods imported from
  every nation on Earth will be subject to a 10% tariff except for goods from
  the 92 countries listed in an annex that are subject to higher tariff rates.
  The highest tariff is on goods from Syria, which will be taxed at 41%. Tariffs
  on two countries, the United Kingdom and Brazil, are listed at 10%, but a
  previous order signed by Trump added a further 40% tariff on some Brazilian
  goods, to punish the country for prosecuting its former president, Jair
  Bolsonaro, for trying to overturn an election he lost and inspiring his
  supporters to storm the seat of government. Trump’s order excluded many of the
  most common imports from Brazil from the additional tariff, including wood
  pulp, metals and airplanes, but left the duty in place for coffee. Goods from
  the remote Falkland Islands, which remain a British overseas territory, are
  also set at 10%. Following an agreement with the European Union, Americans
  importing goods from that 27-nation bloc will be hit with a 15% tariff. The
  new country-specific tariffs are a sweeping change to the rates unveiled by
  Trump with a flourish in the Rose Garden on 2 April. Among major US trading
  partners, imports from Taiwan will now be subject to a tariff of 20% instead
  of 32%; imports from Japan will be subject to a 15% tariff, instead of 24%;
  imports from South Korea will be subject to a 15% tariff, instead of 25%. The
  revised rates include a drop in tariffs on goods from: Vietnam, which were set
  at 46% in April, to 20% now; Indonesia, which was 32% and is now 19%;
  Bangladesh, which was 37% and is now 20%; Cambodia which was 49% and is now
  19%; Laos, which was 48% and is now 40%; Sri Lanka, which was 44% and is now
  20%; Thailand, which was 36% and is now 19%; and Lesotho, which was 50% and is
  now 15%. Oddly, the rate for the Philippines has increased from 17% to 19%,
  even though its president, Bongbong Marcos, recently completed a friendly
  visit to the White House. The rate for South Africa, a nation whose president
  dismissed Trump’s claims that its white population was being persecuted,
  remains unchanged at 30%. The rate on goods from Serbia dropped only slightly,
  from 37% in April to 35% now, despite its president’s strong support for
  Trump. Israel was given a similarly small reduction from 17% in April to 15%
  now. Another close ally of Trump, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, saw
  the tariff rate on goods from his country drop from 26% to 25%. The rate for
  imports from Switzerland, which has close ties to the European Union, also
  increased, from 31% in April to 39% now. Donald Trump signed an executive
  order on Thursday to increase tariffs on Canadian goods imported to the United
  States from 25% to 35%. The new import tax rates goes into effect on Friday,
  according to a White House factsheet. The White House cited what it called
  Trump’s power to impose tariffs in response to a national emergency under the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law, on the same day that
  the government asked a federal appeals court to overturn a trade court ruling
  that the law gave Trump no such power. The White House claimed that Trump had
  increased tariffs on Canada because it had failed to act on “the public health
  crisis caused by fentanyl and illicit drugs flowing across the northern border
  into the United States”. However, in the early hours of Thursday morning,
  Trump had posted on social media that he might not strike a deal with Canada
  on tariffs as punishment for its decision to recognize the state of Palestine.
  “Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,”
  Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us
  to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!!” Several commentators suggested
  that Trump’s statement that he might use tariffs to influence another nation’s
  foreign policy could become part of the legal case before the appeals court
  that he was not, in fact, responding to any real emergency. As the Canadian
  Broadcasting Corporation reported this month: “The latest data from US Customs
  and Border Protection (CBP) shows an uptick in the amount of fentanyl seized
  near the American northern border with Canada – but the quantities intercepted
  remain a tiny fraction of what’s coming from Mexico.” A legal review board in
  Washington recommended on Thursday that Jeffrey Clark, a lawyer who currently
  works in the White House Office of Management and Budget, should lose his
  licence to practise law over his role in Donald Trump’s effort to stay in
  office after losing the 2020 election. The recommendation from the District of
  Columbia Bar’s board on professional responsibility has to be approved by DC
  court of appeals, but it also imposes an automatic suspension unless Clark can
  convince the court to block his punishment within 30 days. Clarke was charged
  with “attempted dishonesty and attempted serious interference with the
  administration of justice” for offering, as a justice department official in
  late 2020, to send a letter to the state of Georgia saying that the department
  had “identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the
  election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.” As Jeffrey
  Rosen, the acting attorney general at the time, and Richard Donoghue, his
  deputy, told the January 6 committee, after they told Clark that there was no
  such evidence, they learned that Trump was considering a plan to make Clark
  the acting attorney general and have him send the letter. Around the same
  time, according to handwritten notes taken by Donoghue , Trump pressed Rosen
  to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the
  [Republican] Congressmen.” As the review board’s ruling explains, at an Oval
  office meeting on 3 January 2021, Clark argued to Trump that he should be
  appointed acting attorney general, and promised to “conduct nationwide
  investigations that would uncover outcome-determinative election issues in
  just a few days.” When his superiors Rosen and Donoghue objected to what the
  called that “completely unrealistic” proposal, Trump suggested that he might
  as well “give it a shot”. Rosen and Donoghue later testified that they then
  told Trump that if he made Clark attorney general, there would be mass
  resignations of justice department leadership, the White House counsel and
  other attorneys in that office. In his testimony to the January 6 committee,
  Donoghue recalled that Trump’s White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, told the
  president “that letter that this guy wants to send, that letter is a
  murder-suicide pact. It’s going to damage everyone who touches it, and we
  should have nothing to do with that letter.” Trump then abandoned the scheme
  to appoint Clark, saying it would not be worth “the breakage”. Clark spent
  much of Thursday thanking supporters like Steve Bannon for denouncing the move
  to strip him of his ability to practise law. Florida will fly official flags
  at half-staff on Friday in honor of the late wrestler Terry Bollea, better
  known as Hulk Hogan, the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis announced on
  Thursday. DeSantis referred to Bollea as “a great Floridian”. The announcement
  made no mention of that fact that the wrestler, who spoke in support of Donald
  Trump at the 2024 Republican National Convention, had his contract terminated
  by World Wrestling Entertainment Inc in 2015, after audio was published of a
  racist tirade in which he used the n-word. At the end of a brief exchange with
  reporters following his announcement on the new sports and fitness council,
  Donald Trump was asked about Gaza by a reporter, specifically if he agrees
  with Marjorie Taylor Greene that “what is occurring there is a genocide”.
  Trump dodged the question. “Oh its terrible what’s occurring there, yeah”, the
  president said. He then repeated his complaint that “nobody said thank you”
  when the United States donated money to feed the people of Gaza, and his false
  claim that the recent donation of $30 million was $60 million. The president
  also reiterated the Israeli talking point that the blame for hunger in Gaza
  lies with Hamas and not Israel, which has blocked humanitarian deliveries for
  months, and imposed a chaotic new system of distribution which has led to more
  then 1,000 Palestinians being killed by live fire from Israeli soldiers. “We
  gave it to people that are in theory watching over it”, Trump said of the
  financial donation. “We wanted Israel to watch over it. Part of the problem is
  Hamas is taking the money and they’re taking the food.” Aid groups have
  identified Israel’s blockade as the cause of the starvation in Gaza, and its
  decision to replace a functioning UN-run distribution system with a
  dysfunctional system run by Israel and private military contractors working
  for the newly created, US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Donald Trump
  introduced new members of the president’s council on sports, fitness and
  nutrition on Thursday and announced that he was “officially restoring the
  presidential fitness test” at the White House on Thursday. Trump was joined by
  several of the new council members, including the golfers Bryson DeChambeau
  and Annika Sörenstam, WWE wrestler Triple H, and current and former NFL
  players Harrison Butker, Nick Bosa and Lawrence Taylor. When he introduced the
  WWE star Triple H as someone who has “been my friend for a long time”, Trump
  looked at the wrestler, who was standing next to him, and appeared not to
  recognize him, continuing to look around the room for him. When Trump invited
  Taylor to speak, the former New York Giant linebacker said that he was glad to
  serve, although he was not sure why he was chosen or “what we’re supposed to
  be doing.” During his first term in office, in 2017, the New Yorker reported
  that Trump was largely against exercise. “Other than golf, he considers
  exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a
  finite amount of energy”, the Washington correspondent Evan Osnos wrote at the
  time. Reuters reports the administration has sent a letter to Harvard
  University informing the university it has referred been referred to the
  Department of Justice, to address the allegations of antisemitic
  discrimination. In the letter from the HHS’ director of the Office of Civil
  Rights – Paula Stannard –writes that the office “has no choice but to refer
  the matter to DOJ” after Harvard “has chosen scorched-earth litigation against
  the Federal government.” Stannard was referring to the university’s lawsuit
  after the administration attempted to freeze more than $2bn in research
  funding. Immediately after the Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador
  Mike Huckabee travel to Gaza on Friday they will brief the president and
  approve a plan for aid and food distribution in the region, White House press
  secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today. This comes after an extensive
  meeting that Witkoff and Huckabee had with Israeli prime minister Netanyahu
  today. Taking a step back, starvation in Gaza is the worst it’s been since the
  beginning of the conflict. And at least 91 people have been killed, and 600
  wounded, while waiting for aid in the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza
  Health ministry. On Truth Social Trump has published letters that he’s sent to
  17 pharmaceutical executives, setting a 60-day deadline for them to bring down
  drug prices for Americans. In the letters – sent to execs at AstraZeneca, Eli
  Lilly, and Johnson &amp; Johnson among others – Trump threatened to “deploy
  every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive
  drug pricing practices.” This comes after Trump signed his “most favoured
  nation” executive order back in May, which ties the cost of drug prices to the
  lowest price offered to any other developed foreign country. A funeral for
  Didarul Islam – the NYPD police officer shot and killed three days ago at an
  office building in Midtown Manhattan – saw thousands of mourners line the
  streets as his coffin arrived at Parkchester Jame Masjid, a mosque in the
  Bronx. Below are some pictures of the procession and the tributes: Today’s
  White House press briefing wrapped a short while ago, and press secretary
  Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador
  Mike Huckabee had a “very productive” conversation with Israeli prime minister
  Benjamin Netanyahu. The pair will travel to Gaza tomorrow to assess the
  worsening humanitarian and starvation crisis. The White House doubled down on
  the president’s displeasure in recognising Palestinian statehood – a promise
  made by the UK, France and Canada if Israel is unable to agree to a ceasefire.
  The White House said that the president considers statehood as ultimately
  ‘rewarding Hamas’. As Trump’s 1 August tariff deadline looms, he has issued a
  90-day extension for Mexico to try to reach a deal. Mexico’s president Claudia
  Sheinbaum characterised her call with the president as “very good” in a post
  on X. The country would have faced 35% tariffs from tomorrow without the
  extension. Karoline Leavitt clarified that the reciprocal tariffs will take
  effect at midnight tonight. But added she wouldn’t rule out any deals that
  could be cut before then. Democrats, however, have lambasted the president’s
  latest trade deals – including the 15% tariff on South Korean imports. Senate
  minority leader Chuck Schumer said earlier today that “15% is far from a
  victory, because it is American families who are ones who are going to have to
  pay for it in the end.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt notes, emphatically,
  that the president disagrees with the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada
  and their decision to recognise Palestinian statehood if Israel fails to agree
  to a ceasefire in the coming months. “He feels as though that’s rewarding
  Hamas at a time where Hamas is the true impediment to a cease fire into the
  release of all of the hostages,” she said. It was only yesterday that Donald
  Trump called Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri a “second-tier senator.” This
  came after Hawley’s legislation that bans lawmakers, the president and
  vice-president from stock trading was advanced by a key committee. Today,
  press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that the president has spoken with
  Senator Hawley, but was evasive about his thoughts on the specifics of the
  legislation. “As for the mechanics of the legislation, how it will move
  forward, the White House continues to be in discussions with our friends on
  Capitol Hill,” she said. Leavitt clarified that the reciprocal tariffs will
  take effect at midnight tonight. But added she didn’t rule out any deals that
  could be cut before then. “I do know foreign leaders are ringing his phone
  realizing this deadline is a real thing for them tomorrow when they’re
  bringing offers to the table,” she said. Leavitt concludes her opening remarks
  by telling the press that the construction of a new White House ballroom is
  set to begin. It will total 90,000 square feet and hold up to 650 seats.
  Leavitt adds that tomorrow Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee will be
  traveling into Gaza to “inspect the current distribution sites and secure a
  plan to deliver more food.” Leavitt adds that the officials will and meet with
  local Gazans to hear “first-hand about this dire situation on the ground.”
  Leavitt tells the press that Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee had “a very
  productive meeting with prime minister Netanyahu and other officials today in
  Israel on the topic of delivering much needed food and aid to Gaza.” White
  House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has begun her briefing. She opens
  offering the administration’s condolences to the family of New York police
  officer Didarul Islam – who was killed this week in a Midtown Manhattan
  shooting. Today, Mr Islam’s funeral is taking place in New York, with NYPD
  officers and city officials in attendance. Mayor Eric Adams delivered an
  address at the service. The presidential fitness test was once a high school
  staple in the US. It was first implemented by President Dwight D. Eisenhower
  in 1956, and required middle and high school students at American public
  schools to perform a number of exercises. It included a one-mile run,
  push-ups, and sit-ups. It was eventually replaced under President Barack Obama
  in 2013 for the Presidential Youth Fitness Program. This was focused more on
  overall health than physical performance. We’re also expecting press secretary
  Karoline Leavitt to hold a briefing shortly. We can expect questions about
  Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff’s trip to Israel, and the looming tariff
  deadline. Later today, Donald Trump will sign an executive order that will
  reestablish the President’s council of sports, nutrition and fitness. The
  executive order will also reinstitute the presidential fitness test in public
  schools, a White House official confirms to the Guardian. The test was phased
  out of the school curriculum over a decade ago. CNN first reported the details
  of the order. In remarks on the Senate floor this morning, reported by NBC
  News, minority leader Chuck Schumer slammed the president over his latest
  trade deals with other countries, calling “his trade war … an experiment in
  chaos, dishonesty and inflation”. He said of the new deal with South Korea:
  Instead of levering a 25% tariff as he threatened, Donald Trump says South
  Korea will face 15% tariffs. And then he pretends like that’s some kind of
  victory. 15% is far from a victory, because it is American families who are
  ones who are going to have to pay for it in the end. Schumer said raising
  prices by 15% on imported goods is “a lot of money to a lot of people”.
  “Inflation continues to accelerate as Trump tariffs continue to hammer
  American pocketbooks,” Schumer continued. That means Americans are paying
  more. Inflation goes up, the American family pays more. That’s because, in
  part, of Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added: Four months since Donald Trump’s
  so-called Liberation Day, his trade war has been an experiment in chaos,
  dishonesty and inflation. Senior aides to the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
  conducted polygraphs on their own colleagues this spring, in some cases as
  part of an effort to flush out anyone who leaked to the media and apparently
  to undercut rivals in others, according to four people familiar with the
  matter. The polygraphs came at a time of profound upheaval in his office, as
  Hegseth opened a leak investigation and sought to identify the culprits by any
  means necessary after a series of sensitive disclosures and unflattering
  stories. But the polygraphs became contentious after the aides who were
  targeted questioned whether they were even official, given at least one
  polygraph was ordered without Hegseth’s direct knowledge and sparked an
  intervention by a Trump adviser who does not work at the Pentagon. The fraught
  episode involved Hegseth’s lawyer and part-time navy commander Tim Parlatore
  seeking to polygraph Patrick Weaver, a senior adviser to the secretary who was
  at the White House in Donald Trump’s first term and has ties to Trump’s deputy
  chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the people said. When Weaver learned of his
  impending polygraph, he complained to associates that he had been suspected
  without evidence, the people said. That led the external Trump adviser to take
  his complaint to Hegseth – only for Hegseth to say he did not even know about
  the test. The external Trump adviser called Parlatore on his cellphone to shut
  down the impending polygraph, shouting down the line that in Trump’s second
  term, career employees did not get to question political appointees, according
  to two people familiar with the conversation. Weaver does not appear to have
  escalated his complaint to the White House, telling associates that he
  preferred not to bother Miller with problems. Earlier reports suggested the
  White House intervened on Weaver’s behalf but the people said the White House
  learned of the test after it was cancelled. A White House spokesperson
  declined to comment. A Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said in a
  statement: “The Department will not comment on an ongoing investigation.” The
  extraordinary episode underscored ongoing concerns around Hegseth’s ability to
  manage the Pentagon – he is still facing an inspector general report into his
  disclosures in a Signal chat about US strikes against the Houthis – and why a
  Trump adviser ended up staging an intervention. Trump posted about the hearing
  in my last post on his Truth Social platform earlier today, calling it
  “America’s big case”. He claimed: If our Country was not able to protect
  itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE ‘DEAD,’ WITH NO CHANCE OF
  SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Now the tide has completely turned, and America has
  successfully countered this onslaught of Tariffs used against it. ONE YEAR
  AGO, AMERICA WAS A DEAD COUNTRY, NOW IT IS THE “HOTTEST”COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN
  THE WORLD. Ed Pilkington and Callum Jones in New York Donald Trump’s global
  tariffs faced significant skepticism in a federal appeals court on Thursday,
  as judges investigated whether the president had overstretched his powers just
  hours before the latest sweeping round of duties is set to kick in. The full
  11-strong bench of the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in
  Washington DC is considering whether Trump exceeded his authority in imposing
  “reciprocal” tariffs on a large number of US trading partners. Judges
  repeatedly asked if Trump was justified in relying on emergency powers to
  effectively tear up the US tariff schedule without consulting Congress.
  Businesses challenging his strategy accused the White House of engineering a
  “breathtaking” attempt to force it through, unlike any trade move attempted by
  a US administration in two centuries. The 1977 International Emergency
  Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump has used to invoke emergency powers
  and enforce many of his tariffs, “doesn’t even say ‘tariffs’”, one of the
  judges noted. “Doesn’t even mention them.” In May a three-judge panel of the
  court of international trade blocked the import duties on grounds that Trump’s
  use of IEEPA was unjustified. The appeals court has stayed that ruling pending
  the outcome of Thursday’s hearing. “The government uses IEEPA all the time,”
  Brett Shumate, assistant attorney general in the justice department’s civil
  division, representing the administration, told the court. He conceded,
  however, that it was the first IEEPA had been used to implement tariffs. The
  US trade deficit has “reached a tipping point”, claimed Shumate, enabling
  Trump to take emergency action. “It’s affecting our military readiness,” he
  said. “It’s affecting our domestic manufacturing capability.” But Neal Katyal,
  a lawyer representing businesses challenging the tariffs, argued that Trump
  was laying a “breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in
  200 years”. The administration is effectively saying “that our federal courts
  are powerless; that the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants,
  for as long he wants – so long as he declares an emergency”, Katyal argued.
  The challenge to Trump’s use of emergency powers has been brought by five
  small businesses acting alongside 12 Democratic-controlled states. They argue
  that the IEEPA was designed to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats
  arising in national emergencies, and that the reason for the tariffs do not
  meet that standard. The small businesses are being represented by a
  libertarian public interest law firm, the Liberty Justice Center. The
  non-profit is supported by billionaire rightwing donors including Robert
  Mercer and Richard Uihlein, who, paradoxically, have also been major backers
  of Trump’s presidential campaigns. Donald Trump’s extension of the deadline
  for a tariff deal with Mexico by another 90 days is fuelling speculation that
  he could announce pauses for dozens of other countries that face punitive
  higher import duties from tomorrow. As the countdown continues to his deadline
  for a trade deal – already extended by four weeks from the original 90 days –
  the US president said he had made the decision to offer more time to Mexico
  because of the complexities of the trading relationship. “We will be talking
  to Mexico over the next 90 Days with the goal of signing a Trade Deal
  somewhere within the 90 Day period of time, or longer,” he wrote on social
  media. A little more than two weeks ago Trump threatened both the EU and
  Mexico with tariffs of 30% on most exports to the US, but last Sunday he
  concluded a deal with Brussels with a 15% baseline rate from 1 August. Writing
  on his Truth Social platform, Trump said: “I have just concluded a telephone
  conversation with the President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, which was very
  successful in that, more and more, we are getting to know and understand each
  other. “The complexities of a Deal with Mexico are somewhat different than
  other Nations because of both the problems, and assets, of the Border. “We
  have agreed to extend, for a 90 Day period, the exact same Deal as we had for
  the last short period of time, namely, that Mexico will continue to pay a 25%
  Fentanyl Tariff, 25% Tariff on Cars, and 50% Tariff on Steel, Aluminum, and
  Copper.” Former vice-president Kamala Harris has given her first interview
  since last year’s election to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS
  tonight at 11.35pm ET. It comes a day after she announced that she won’t run
  for governor of California next year. As my colleague Lauren Gambino wrote:
  “Harris’s decision throws open the race for California’s governorship, a post
  seen as a critical bulwark against Trump’s agenda. “It also leaves open the
  possibility that Harris could run again for political office. She did not rule
  out another run for the White House, saying only that “for now, my leadership
  – and public service – will not be in elected office”. Harris also announced
  today that she’s set to release a memoir about her brief 2024 presidential run
  on 23 September. Earlier this month, CBS owner Paramount announced it was
  canceling Colbert’s show amid a political firestorm, with Trump revelling in
  the the country’s top-rated late-night talk show host’s firing. Mexico’s
  president Claudia Sheinbaum said in a post on X: We had a very good call with
  the President of the United States, Donald Trump. We avoided the tariff
  increase announced for tomorrow and secured 90 days to build a long-term
  agreement through dialogue. Donald Trump and Mexican president Claudia
  Sheinbaum have spoken on the phone this morning as Mexico seeks an agreement
  with its biggest trading partner ahead of Trump’s 1 August deadline. “Mexico
  will continue to pay a 25% Fentanyl Tariff, 25% Tariff on Cars, and 50% Tariff
  on Steel, Aluminum, and Copper. Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately
  terminate its Non Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said
  in a Truth Social post. Trump said his administration would continue talking
  to Mexico over the next 90 days (“or longer”) with the goal of signing a trade
  deal. He had previously threatened Mexico with a 30% tariff rate. Here are
  some of the ways that Democratic senators say Doge managed to waste $21.7bn:
  Paying about 200,000 federal employees not to work for as much as eight
  months, under the Deferred Resignation Program. This had the largest price
  tag, at $14.8bn. Also expensive was firing or putting on long-term
  administrative leave another 100,000-plus workers, which cost $6.1bn. The
  emails that some federal workers were required to send detailing what they had
  done each week cost $155m and amounted to “millions of hours of wasted time”,
  according to the report. Donald Trump’s decision to freeze grants cost the
  energy department $263m in lost income from grants and fees for utility
  projects “supporting energy affordability and grid resilience,” the report
  said. The food aid and medical supplies Trump refuses to distribute and now
  intends to destroy will cost $110m. Democrats on a Senate investigative
  committee have blasted Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency
  (Doge) initiative for wasting money, paying hundreds of thousands of federal
  employees not to work and doing little to accomplish its stated goals. The
  report from Democrats on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is
  titled “The $21.7b Blunder”, and accuses Trump, Doge and its former head Elon
  Musk of wasting that amount of money by rapidly dismantling government
  functions without bothering to understand how they work. “With Elon Musk at
  its head for its first four months, it is unsurprising that DOGE modeled
  itself on a defunct corporate motto, seeking to ‘move fast and break things,’”
  the report reads. “Yet DOGE seems to have stopped there, never taking the time
  to fix — let alone understand— the things it had broken. By prioritizing
  disruption over governance and failing to identify solutions for any of the
  problems it purported to solve, DOGE has created its own forms of waste.” You
  can read the report here. Here’s more from the Guardian’s Sam Levine and
  George Chidi about the plans by Texas’s Republican-dominated legislature to
  redraw their congressional maps ahead of next year’s midterm elections, which
  have sparked outrage among Democrats and threats of retaliation: Republicans
  have unveiled a new congressional map in Texas that would allow the party to
  pick up as many as five additional congressional seats, an aggressive maneuver
  that has already met decisive outcry from Democrats and comes as the GOP tries
  to stave off losses in next year’s midterm elections. Republicans already hold
  25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats. But at the urging of Donald Trump,
  Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, called a special session this month to redraw
  the state’s congressional districts. After contentious hearings across the
  state, Republicans unveiled their proposed map on Wednesday. “We expected them
  to be greedy,” said Sam Gostomski, executive director of the Texas Democratic
  party. “The bottom line is, they are going to turn Texas into almost certainly
  the most gerrymandered state in the country.” Had the map been in place for
  the 2024 election, Trump would have carried 30 of the districts, while Kamala
  Harris would have carried just eight, according to data from Dave’s
  Redistricting App, an online tool that allows for analysis of voting
  districts. Today we’ll also be keeping an eye on House minority leader Hakeem
  Jeffries who has been in Texas, meeting with Democrats in the state, as a
  redistricting showdown ensues. Yesterday, state Republicans released their
  proposed congressional map which would allow the GOP to pick up five seats in
  the state. They already hold 25 of Texas’ 38 congressional districts. Jeffries
  is expected to hold a press conference later today. Steve Witkoff, the Trump
  administration’s Middle East envoy, is in Israel today meeting with prime
  minister Netanyahu. This will be Witkoff’s first public visit to Israel since
  May, and comes as the starvation crisis in Gaza escalates. It also comes as a
  number of allies – including Canada, France and the UK say they will
  reconginise Palestinian statehood if Israel fails to address the worsening
  humanitarian crisis and agree to a ceasefire with Hamas. Follow along with the
  latest updates in the region here. In response to the failed Senate vote
  yesterday to block arms sales to Israel, a number of lawmakers have reacted.
  Particularly senators who have grown increasingly concerned with Israel’s
  actions and the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Democratic senator Lisa
  Blunt Rochester of Delaware joined senator Duckworth as a new supporter of
  suspending military sales to Israel. She said that “until Israel significantly
  shifts its military posture to end the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and
  the West Bank, I cannot in good conscience support further military aid and
  arms sales to Israel.” Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin also explained his
  vote with similar reasoning. “Prime minister Netanyahu has gone too far. The
  humanitarian conditions in Gaza are appalling, unconscionable, and cruel,”
  Durbin said in a statement. However, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer
  voted “no” to block arms sales, adding that “I have also long held that
  security assistance to Israel is not about any one government but about our
  support for the Israeli people.” • This post was amended on 1 August 2025.
  Lisa Blunt Rochester is a senator from Delaware, not Maryland as an earlier
  version said. Meanwhile Trump posted on Truth Social today that the “The
  fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER
  AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” This comes after his remarks earlier this week
  acknowledging that there is “real starvation in Gaza.” An apparent break from
  Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s who claims there is no starvation.
  Earlier this month the World Health Organization said there have been 63
  malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza in July. 24 of them are children under the
  age of five. A vote to block arms sales to Israel failed in the Senate late
  yesterday. But the effort, spearheaded by Senator Bernie Sanders, did see 12
  new Democrats vote to stop the sale of American weapons to Israel. One of them
  is Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois –who served as a US army helicopter
  pilot in the Iraq war. She explained her decision in a statement: My votes
  tonight reflect my deep frustration with the Netanyahu government’s abject
  failure to address humanitarian needs in Gaza and send a message to the Trump
  Administration that it must change course if it wants to help end this
  devastating war. One the eve of Trump’s tariff deadline, a federal appeals
  court will hear arguments from businesses who claim taxes on foreign imports
  are proving destructive. The plaintiffs claim the president sidestepped
  congressional approval when he implemented his “liberation day” tairffs back
  in April. Earlier, the President took to Truth Social to wish his legal team
  luck: To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country,
  good luck in America’s big case today. If our Country was not able to protect
  itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE “DEAD,” WITH NO CHANCE OF
  SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter! My colleague
  Ed Pilkington has more on the background of the case here Donald Trump is at
  the White House today. His schedule includes lunch with JD Vance, the
  vice-president, followed by an executive order signing at 4pm EST. Also on the
  agenda today Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, will hold a briefing at
  around 1pm EST. The United States believes it has the makings of a trade deal
  with China, but it is “not 100% done,” Scott Bessent told CNBC in an
  interview, adding that he would talk to Donald Trump later on Thursday. The US
  treasury secretary also said he did not know what would happen with trade with
  India, saying it had “not been a great global actor”. Donald Trump again
  criticised Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday, a day after the
  US central bank held interest rates steady in a 9-2 vote. In a post on Truth
  Social, he wrote: Jerome “Too Late” Powell has done it again!!! He is TOO
  LATE, and actually, TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, &amp; TOO POLITICAL, to have the
  job of Fed Chair. He is costing our Country TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, in addition
  to one of the most incompetent, or corrupt, renovations of a building(s) in
  the history of construction! Put another way, “Too Late” is a TOTAL LOSER, and
  our Country is paying the price! The US Federal Reserve left its benchmark
  interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, even amid intense pressure from Donald
  Trump to lower rates. Despite an onslaught of attacks from the White House
  against the Fed, officials at the central bank said that economic
  “uncertainty” remains too high to lower rates. But two of the Fed’s governors
  voted against the decision – the first time that multiple governors have voted
  against the majority since 1993. Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle
  Bowman, both appointed by Trump, wanted rates to be lowered. Both have been
  floated as potential replacements for Fed chair Jerome Powell. Data released
  on Wednesday underlined the resilience of the US economy, which bounced back
  faster than expected in the second quarter. US gross domestic product (GDP)
  grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to the
  latest official data, ahead of the average 2.5% forecast from economists. This
  marked a significant acceleration from a 0.5% contraction in the first
  quarter, which was dragged down by a surge of imports as companies tried to
  get ahead of Trump’s tariffs. But the rebound was boosted by a 30% slump in
  imports. Trump used the news to once again call for a rate cut and again
  insulted Powell, whom he has nicknamed “Too Late”. “2Q GDP JUST OUT: 3%, WAY
  BETTER THAN EXPECTED! ‘Too Late’ MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let
  people buy, and refinance, their homes!” he wrote on Truth Social. President
  Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped a 50% tariff on most Brazilian goods to
  fight what he has called a “witch hunt” against former president Jair
  Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy
  and orange juice from heavier levies. Trump announced the tariffs, some of the
  steepest levied on any economy in the US trade war, as his administration also
  unveiled sanctions on the Brazilian supreme court justice who has been
  overseeing Bolsonaro’s trial on charges of plotting a coup, Reuters reported.
  “Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an
  unlawful witch hunt against US and Brazilian citizens and companies,” Treasury
  secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. Bessent said Moraes “is
  responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions
  that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions” including against
  former president Jair Bolsonaro.” Last week, the Brazilian justice levied
  search warrants and restraining orders against Bolsonaro over allegations he
  courted Trump’s interference in his criminal case, in which he is accused of
  plotting to stop President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in
  2023. The Trump administration is pushing an initiative for millions of
  Americans to upload personal health data and medical records on new apps and
  systems run by private tech companies, promising easier to access health
  records and wellness monitoring. The new system will focus on diabetes and
  weight management, conversational artificial intelligence that helps patients,
  and digital tools such as QR codes and apps that register patients for
  check-ins or track medications. The initiative, spearheaded by an
  administration that has already freely shared highly personal data about
  Americans in ways that have tested legal bounds, could put patients’ desires
  for more convenience at their doctor’s office on a collision course with their
  expectations that their medical information be kept private. “There are
  enormous ethical and legal concerns,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown
  University law professor who specializes in public health. “Patients across
  America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used
  in ways that harm them and their families.” President Donald Trump said that
  the United States has done very little business with India, and that Russia
  and the US do almost no business together. “I don’t care what India does with
  Russia”, he said in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding that “they can
  take their dead economies down together, for all I care”. In an earlier Truth
  Social post on Wednesday Trump talked about India’s trade with Russia when
  announcing the US would impose a 25% tariff on goods imported from India
  starting on Friday. In response to the earlier Truth Social post, the Indian
  government said it was studying the implications of Trump’s announcements and
  remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal. Trump said that India has
  always bought a vast majority of their military equipment and energy from
  Russia, which was “not good”. The US tariff rate on Malaysian goods will be
  announced on Friday, Malaysian premier Anwar Ibrahim said on Thursday after
  speaking to US president Donald Trump. Malaysia is facing a 25% tariff on its
  exports to the United States unless a deal with Washington is reached by
  Friday. The two countries have held multiple rounds of talks, with Malaysia’s
  trade minister saying several sticking points remained, particularly on
  non-trade barriers. Anwar said he discussed tariffs “in the spirit and
  principle of free trade” during a phone conversation with Trump early on
  Thursday. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the US will charge a 15%
  tariff on imports from South Korea, down from a threatened 25%, as part of a
  deal that eases tensions with a top-10 trading partner and key Asian ally.
  South Korea also agreed to invest $350 billion in the United States in
  projects selected by Trump and to purchase energy products worth $100 billion,
  Reuters reported. The arrangement, announced after Trump met with Korean
  officials at the White House, came during a blizzard of trade policy
  announcements. Many countries are rushing to cut deals ahead of 1 August, when
  Trump has promised higher tariffs will kick in. “I am pleased to announce that
  the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with
  the Republic of Korea,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The negotiations were an
  early test for South Korean president Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June
  after a snap election. He said the deal eliminated uncertainty and set US
  tariffs lower than or at the same level as major competitors. “We have crossed
  a big hurdle,” Lee said in a Facebook post. Trump said Lee would visit the
  White House “within the next two weeks” for his first meeting with the U.S.
  president. South Korea will accept American products, including autos and
  agricultural goods into its markets and impose no import duties on them, Trump
  added. South Korea’s top officials said the country’s rice and beef markets
  would not be opened further, and discussions over US demands on food
  regulations continue. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of US
  politics as Donald Trump intensified his trade war with Canada a day ahead of
  his 1 August deadline for a tariff agreement. The president posted on his
  Truth Social platform: Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing
  statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade
  Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!! Trump is set to impose a 35% tariff on all
  Canadian goods not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement if the two
  countries do not reach an agreement by the deadline. Canadian prime minister
  Mark Carney previously said tariff negotiations with Washington had been
  constructive, but the talks may not conclude by the deadline. Canada is the
  second-largest US trading partner after Mexico, and the largest buyer of US
  exports. Carney followed France and Britain as he said on Wednesday that his
  country was planning to recognize Palestine at a meeting of the United Nations
  in September. We’ll be bringing you all the developments on this story today.
  In other news: Trump has said the US will charge a 15% tariff on imports from
  South Korea as part of an agreement with the key Asian trading partner and
  ally that avoids even higher levies. In contrast on Wednesday, Trump placed
  25% tariffs on imports from India and 50% on those from Brazil. Brown
  University has reached an agreement with the Trump administration that will
  reinstate nearly $50m in research funding by agreeing a commitment to
  nondiscrimination in both admissions and campus programs, and will grant
  federal officials access to its admissions data. Meanwhile $108m in federal
  research funding to Duke University has been frozen. The US Federal Reserve
  left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, even amid intense
  pressure from Trump to lower rates. Earlier in the day, figures showed US
  gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 3%
  in the second quarter of 2025. Kamala Harris announced on Wednesday that she
  will not run for governor of California – a highly anticipated decision that
  leaves the contest to lead the country’s largest blue state wide open.

The US politics liveblog is closing but you can continue to follow live coverage of the Trump tariffs news on a new liveblog here. Here are the latest developments: Donald Trump signed an executive order to increase tariffs on Canadian goods imported to the US from 25% to 35%, hours after he suggested that a trade deal would be hampered by Canada’s decision to recognize Palestine as a state. Trump revised the global tariffs he announced, and then paused, in April, to impose a minimum 10% import tax on goods from across the globe, with higher rates on 92 nations listed in an annex. The rates take effect in 7 days. Joe Biden gave a 20-minute address to an association of Black lawyers, and tore into Trump, saying that the rule of law was at threat “under the pressure we’re under now with this guy we have as president”. A legal review board recommended that Jeffrey Clark, a lawyer who works in the White House Office of Management and Budget, should lose his license to practice law over his role in Trump’s effort to overturn his 2020 election loss. A civil rights arm of the health department referred Harvard University to the department of justice over allegations that Jewish students were discriminated against during protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. The former president, Joe Biden, just spoke in Chicago at a gala to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the National Bar Association, the nation’s oldest and largest national association of predominantly Black lawyers, judges and law students. The 82-year-old, whose mental competency was called into question after a disastrous debate performance last year, leading him to end his re-election bid, spoke fluently and with energy for the most part, if occasionally too quickly, as if determined to assuage the concerns that are still the subject of investigations by the Republican congress. In a 20-minute address, streamed live by Fox News, Biden offered an impassioned defense of the judges he nominated to the federal bench as president, and of the rule of law itself. “Judges matter, courts matter, the law matters and the constitution matters” he said, his voice rising. “I think a lot of Americans are starting to realize that, under the pressure we’re under now with this guy we have as president”. As the crowd reacted to that comment on Trump, Biden shook his head and added: “Oh get ready folks, this is just starting”. After reciting his familiar claim to have been inspired by the civl rights movement to become a public defender before entering politics, Biden criticized Donald Trump, without naming him, for disregarding the law. The executive branch, he said, “seems to be doing its best to dismantle the constitution”. He added, “and they’re doing it all too often with the help of a congress that is just sitting on the sidelines, and enabled by the highest court in the nation”. In a break from his prepared remarks, Biden added, of the supreme court, “the rulings they’ve made, my God.” Biden also accused the Trump administration of working to erase “all the gains we’ve made” and “to erase justice itself”. Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday modifying the tariff rates he first announced in April ahead of a Friday deadline for the new rates on imported goods to go into effect. The order states that goods imported from every nation on Earth will be subject to a 10% tariff except for goods from the 92 countries listed in an annex that are subject to higher tariff rates. The highest tariff is on goods from Syria, which will be taxed at 41%. Tariffs on two countries, the United Kingdom and Brazil, are listed at 10%, but a previous order signed by Trump added a further 40% tariff on some Brazilian goods, to punish the country for prosecuting its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to overturn an election he lost and inspiring his supporters to storm the seat of government. Trump’s order excluded many of the most common imports from Brazil from the additional tariff, including wood pulp, metals and airplanes, but left the duty in place for coffee. Goods from the remote Falkland Islands, which remain a British overseas territory, are also set at 10%. Following an agreement with the European Union, Americans importing goods from that 27-nation bloc will be hit with a 15% tariff. The new country-specific tariffs are a sweeping change to the rates unveiled by Trump with a flourish in the Rose Garden on 2 April. Among major US trading partners, imports from Taiwan will now be subject to a tariff of 20% instead of 32%; imports from Japan will be subject to a 15% tariff, instead of 24%; imports from South Korea will be subject to a 15% tariff, instead of 25%. The revised rates include a drop in tariffs on goods from: Vietnam, which were set at 46% in April, to 20% now; Indonesia, which was 32% and is now 19%; Bangladesh, which was 37% and is now 20%; Cambodia which was 49% and is now 19%; Laos, which was 48% and is now 40%; Sri Lanka, which was 44% and is now 20%; Thailand, which was 36% and is now 19%; and Lesotho, which was 50% and is now 15%. Oddly, the rate for the Philippines has increased from 17% to 19%, even though its president, Bongbong Marcos, recently completed a friendly visit to the White House. The rate for South Africa, a nation whose president dismissed Trump’s claims that its white population was being persecuted, remains unchanged at 30%. The rate on goods from Serbia dropped only slightly, from 37% in April to 35% now, despite its president’s strong support for Trump. Israel was given a similarly small reduction from 17% in April to 15% now. Another close ally of Trump, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, saw the tariff rate on goods from his country drop from 26% to 25%. The rate for imports from Switzerland, which has close ties to the European Union, also increased, from 31% in April to 39% now. Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to increase tariffs on Canadian goods imported to the United States from 25% to 35%. The new import tax rates goes into effect on Friday, according to a White House factsheet. The White House cited what it called Trump’s power to impose tariffs in response to a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law, on the same day that the government asked a federal appeals court to overturn a trade court ruling that the law gave Trump no such power. The White House claimed that Trump had increased tariffs on Canada because it had failed to act on “the public health crisis caused by fentanyl and illicit drugs flowing across the northern border into the United States”. However, in the early hours of Thursday morning, Trump had posted on social media that he might not strike a deal with Canada on tariffs as punishment for its decision to recognize the state of Palestine. “Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!!” Several commentators suggested that Trump’s statement that he might use tariffs to influence another nation’s foreign policy could become part of the legal case before the appeals court that he was not, in fact, responding to any real emergency. As the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported this month: “The latest data from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shows an uptick in the amount of fentanyl seized near the American northern border with Canada – but the quantities intercepted remain a tiny fraction of what’s coming from Mexico.” A legal review board in Washington recommended on Thursday that Jeffrey Clark, a lawyer who currently works in the White House Office of Management and Budget, should lose his licence to practise law over his role in Donald Trump’s effort to stay in office after losing the 2020 election. The recommendation from the District of Columbia Bar’s board on professional responsibility has to be approved by DC court of appeals, but it also imposes an automatic suspension unless Clark can convince the court to block his punishment within 30 days. Clarke was charged with “attempted dishonesty and attempted serious interference with the administration of justice” for offering, as a justice department official in late 2020, to send a letter to the state of Georgia saying that the department had “identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.” As Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general at the time, and Richard Donoghue, his deputy, told the January 6 committee, after they told Clark that there was no such evidence, they learned that Trump was considering a plan to make Clark the acting attorney general and have him send the letter. Around the same time, according to handwritten notes taken by Donoghue , Trump pressed Rosen to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the [Republican] Congressmen.” As the review board’s ruling explains, at an Oval office meeting on 3 January 2021, Clark argued to Trump that he should be appointed acting attorney general, and promised to “conduct nationwide investigations that would uncover outcome-determinative election issues in just a few days.” When his superiors Rosen and Donoghue objected to what the called that “completely unrealistic” proposal, Trump suggested that he might as well “give it a shot”. Rosen and Donoghue later testified that they then told Trump that if he made Clark attorney general, there would be mass resignations of justice department leadership, the White House counsel and other attorneys in that office. In his testimony to the January 6 committee, Donoghue recalled that Trump’s White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, told the president “that letter that this guy wants to send, that letter is a murder-suicide pact. It’s going to damage everyone who touches it, and we should have nothing to do with that letter.” Trump then abandoned the scheme to appoint Clark, saying it would not be worth “the breakage”. Clark spent much of Thursday thanking supporters like Steve Bannon for denouncing the move to strip him of his ability to practise law. Florida will fly official flags at half-staff on Friday in honor of the late wrestler Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis announced on Thursday. DeSantis referred to Bollea as “a great Floridian”. The announcement made no mention of that fact that the wrestler, who spoke in support of Donald Trump at the 2024 Republican National Convention, had his contract terminated by World Wrestling Entertainment Inc in 2015, after audio was published of a racist tirade in which he used the n-word. At the end of a brief exchange with reporters following his announcement on the new sports and fitness council, Donald Trump was asked about Gaza by a reporter, specifically if he agrees with Marjorie Taylor Greene that “what is occurring there is a genocide”. Trump dodged the question. “Oh its terrible what’s occurring there, yeah”, the president said. He then repeated his complaint that “nobody said thank you” when the United States donated money to feed the people of Gaza, and his false claim that the recent donation of $30 million was $60 million. The president also reiterated the Israeli talking point that the blame for hunger in Gaza lies with Hamas and not Israel, which has blocked humanitarian deliveries for months, and imposed a chaotic new system of distribution which has led to more then 1,000 Palestinians being killed by live fire from Israeli soldiers. “We gave it to people that are in theory watching over it”, Trump said of the financial donation. “We wanted Israel to watch over it. Part of the problem is Hamas is taking the money and they’re taking the food.” Aid groups have identified Israel’s blockade as the cause of the starvation in Gaza, and its decision to replace a functioning UN-run distribution system with a dysfunctional system run by Israel and private military contractors working for the newly created, US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Donald Trump introduced new members of the president’s council on sports, fitness and nutrition on Thursday and announced that he was “officially restoring the presidential fitness test” at the White House on Thursday. Trump was joined by several of the new council members, including the golfers Bryson DeChambeau and Annika Sörenstam, WWE wrestler Triple H, and current and former NFL players Harrison Butker, Nick Bosa and Lawrence Taylor. When he introduced the WWE star Triple H as someone who has “been my friend for a long time”, Trump looked at the wrestler, who was standing next to him, and appeared not to recognize him, continuing to look around the room for him. When Trump invited Taylor to speak, the former New York Giant linebacker said that he was glad to serve, although he was not sure why he was chosen or “what we’re supposed to be doing.” During his first term in office, in 2017, the New Yorker reported that Trump was largely against exercise. “Other than golf, he considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy”, the Washington correspondent Evan Osnos wrote at the time. Reuters reports the administration has sent a letter to Harvard University informing the university it has referred been referred to the Department of Justice, to address the allegations of antisemitic discrimination. In the letter from the HHS’ director of the Office of Civil Rights – Paula Stannard –writes that the office “has no choice but to refer the matter to DOJ” after Harvard “has chosen scorched-earth litigation against the Federal government.” Stannard was referring to the university’s lawsuit after the administration attempted to freeze more than $2bn in research funding. Immediately after the Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee travel to Gaza on Friday they will brief the president and approve a plan for aid and food distribution in the region, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today. This comes after an extensive meeting that Witkoff and Huckabee had with Israeli prime minister Netanyahu today. Taking a step back, starvation in Gaza is the worst it’s been since the beginning of the conflict. And at least 91 people have been killed, and 600 wounded, while waiting for aid in the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza Health ministry. On Truth Social Trump has published letters that he’s sent to 17 pharmaceutical executives, setting a 60-day deadline for them to bring down drug prices for Americans. In the letters – sent to execs at AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, and Johnson &amp; Johnson among others – Trump threatened to “deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices.” This comes after Trump signed his “most favoured nation” executive order back in May, which ties the cost of drug prices to the lowest price offered to any other developed foreign country. A funeral for Didarul Islam – the NYPD police officer shot and killed three days ago at an office building in Midtown Manhattan – saw thousands of mourners line the streets as his coffin arrived at Parkchester Jame Masjid, a mosque in the Bronx. Below are some pictures of the procession and the tributes: Today’s White House press briefing wrapped a short while ago, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee had a “very productive” conversation with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The pair will travel to Gaza tomorrow to assess the worsening humanitarian and starvation crisis. The White House doubled down on the president’s displeasure in recognising Palestinian statehood – a promise made by the UK, France and Canada if Israel is unable to agree to a ceasefire. The White House said that the president considers statehood as ultimately ‘rewarding Hamas’. As Trump’s 1 August tariff deadline looms, he has issued a 90-day extension for Mexico to try to reach a deal. Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum characterised her call with the president as “very good” in a post on X. The country would have faced 35% tariffs from tomorrow without the extension. Karoline Leavitt clarified that the reciprocal tariffs will take effect at midnight tonight. But added she wouldn’t rule out any deals that could be cut before then. Democrats, however, have lambasted the president’s latest trade deals – including the 15% tariff on South Korean imports. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said earlier today that “15% is far from a victory, because it is American families who are ones who are going to have to pay for it in the end.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt notes, emphatically, that the president disagrees with the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada and their decision to recognise Palestinian statehood if Israel fails to agree to a ceasefire in the coming months. “He feels as though that’s rewarding Hamas at a time where Hamas is the true impediment to a cease fire into the release of all of the hostages,” she said. It was only yesterday that Donald Trump called Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri a “second-tier senator.” This came after Hawley’s legislation that bans lawmakers, the president and vice-president from stock trading was advanced by a key committee. Today, press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that the president has spoken with Senator Hawley, but was evasive about his thoughts on the specifics of the legislation. “As for the mechanics of the legislation, how it will move forward, the White House continues to be in discussions with our friends on Capitol Hill,” she said. Leavitt clarified that the reciprocal tariffs will take effect at midnight tonight. But added she didn’t rule out any deals that could be cut before then. “I do know foreign leaders are ringing his phone realizing this deadline is a real thing for them tomorrow when they’re bringing offers to the table,” she said. Leavitt concludes her opening remarks by telling the press that the construction of a new White House ballroom is set to begin. It will total 90,000 square feet and hold up to 650 seats. Leavitt adds that tomorrow Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee will be traveling into Gaza to “inspect the current distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food.” Leavitt adds that the officials will and meet with local Gazans to hear “first-hand about this dire situation on the ground.” Leavitt tells the press that Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee had “a very productive meeting with prime minister Netanyahu and other officials today in Israel on the topic of delivering much needed food and aid to Gaza.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has begun her briefing. She opens offering the administration’s condolences to the family of New York police officer Didarul Islam – who was killed this week in a Midtown Manhattan shooting. Today, Mr Islam’s funeral is taking place in New York, with NYPD officers and city officials in attendance. Mayor Eric Adams delivered an address at the service. The presidential fitness test was once a high school staple in the US. It was first implemented by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, and required middle and high school students at American public schools to perform a number of exercises. It included a one-mile run, push-ups, and sit-ups. It was eventually replaced under President Barack Obama in 2013 for the Presidential Youth Fitness Program. This was focused more on overall health than physical performance. We’re also expecting press secretary Karoline Leavitt to hold a briefing shortly. We can expect questions about Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff’s trip to Israel, and the looming tariff deadline. Later today, Donald Trump will sign an executive order that will reestablish the President’s council of sports, nutrition and fitness. The executive order will also reinstitute the presidential fitness test in public schools, a White House official confirms to the Guardian. The test was phased out of the school curriculum over a decade ago. CNN first reported the details of the order. In remarks on the Senate floor this morning, reported by NBC News, minority leader Chuck Schumer slammed the president over his latest trade deals with other countries, calling “his trade war … an experiment in chaos, dishonesty and inflation”. He said of the new deal with South Korea: Instead of levering a 25% tariff as he threatened, Donald Trump says South Korea will face 15% tariffs. And then he pretends like that’s some kind of victory. 15% is far from a victory, because it is American families who are ones who are going to have to pay for it in the end. Schumer said raising prices by 15% on imported goods is “a lot of money to a lot of people”. “Inflation continues to accelerate as Trump tariffs continue to hammer American pocketbooks,” Schumer continued. That means Americans are paying more. Inflation goes up, the American family pays more. That’s because, in part, of Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added: Four months since Donald Trump’s so-called Liberation Day, his trade war has been an experiment in chaos, dishonesty and inflation. Senior aides to the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, conducted polygraphs on their own colleagues this spring, in some cases as part of an effort to flush out anyone who leaked to the media and apparently to undercut rivals in others, according to four people familiar with the matter. The polygraphs came at a time of profound upheaval in his office, as Hegseth opened a leak investigation and sought to identify the culprits by any means necessary after a series of sensitive disclosures and unflattering stories. But the polygraphs became contentious after the aides who were targeted questioned whether they were even official, given at least one polygraph was ordered without Hegseth’s direct knowledge and sparked an intervention by a Trump adviser who does not work at the Pentagon. The fraught episode involved Hegseth’s lawyer and part-time navy commander Tim Parlatore seeking to polygraph Patrick Weaver, a senior adviser to the secretary who was at the White House in Donald Trump’s first term and has ties to Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the people said. When Weaver learned of his impending polygraph, he complained to associates that he had been suspected without evidence, the people said. That led the external Trump adviser to take his complaint to Hegseth – only for Hegseth to say he did not even know about the test. The external Trump adviser called Parlatore on his cellphone to shut down the impending polygraph, shouting down the line that in Trump’s second term, career employees did not get to question political appointees, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Weaver does not appear to have escalated his complaint to the White House, telling associates that he preferred not to bother Miller with problems. Earlier reports suggested the White House intervened on Weaver’s behalf but the people said the White House learned of the test after it was cancelled. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. A Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said in a statement: “The Department will not comment on an ongoing investigation.” The extraordinary episode underscored ongoing concerns around Hegseth’s ability to manage the Pentagon – he is still facing an inspector general report into his disclosures in a Signal chat about US strikes against the Houthis – and why a Trump adviser ended up staging an intervention. Trump posted about the hearing in my last post on his Truth Social platform earlier today, calling it “America’s big case”. He claimed: If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE ‘DEAD,’ WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Now the tide has completely turned, and America has successfully countered this onslaught of Tariffs used against it. ONE YEAR AGO, AMERICA WAS A DEAD COUNTRY, NOW IT IS THE “HOTTEST”COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. Ed Pilkington and Callum Jones in New York Donald Trump’s global tariffs faced significant skepticism in a federal appeals court on Thursday, as judges investigated whether the president had overstretched his powers just hours before the latest sweeping round of duties is set to kick in. The full 11-strong bench of the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC is considering whether Trump exceeded his authority in imposing “reciprocal” tariffs on a large number of US trading partners. Judges repeatedly asked if Trump was justified in relying on emergency powers to effectively tear up the US tariff schedule without consulting Congress. Businesses challenging his strategy accused the White House of engineering a “breathtaking” attempt to force it through, unlike any trade move attempted by a US administration in two centuries. The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump has used to invoke emergency powers and enforce many of his tariffs, “doesn’t even say ‘tariffs’”, one of the judges noted. “Doesn’t even mention them.” In May a three-judge panel of the court of international trade blocked the import duties on grounds that Trump’s use of IEEPA was unjustified. The appeals court has stayed that ruling pending the outcome of Thursday’s hearing. “The government uses IEEPA all the time,” Brett Shumate, assistant attorney general in the justice department’s civil division, representing the administration, told the court. He conceded, however, that it was the first IEEPA had been used to implement tariffs. The US trade deficit has “reached a tipping point”, claimed Shumate, enabling Trump to take emergency action. “It’s affecting our military readiness,” he said. “It’s affecting our domestic manufacturing capability.” But Neal Katyal, a lawyer representing businesses challenging the tariffs, argued that Trump was laying a “breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years”. The administration is effectively saying “that our federal courts are powerless; that the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long he wants – so long as he declares an emergency”, Katyal argued. The challenge to Trump’s use of emergency powers has been brought by five small businesses acting alongside 12 Democratic-controlled states. They argue that the IEEPA was designed to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats arising in national emergencies, and that the reason for the tariffs do not meet that standard. The small businesses are being represented by a libertarian public interest law firm, the Liberty Justice Center. The non-profit is supported by billionaire rightwing donors including Robert Mercer and Richard Uihlein, who, paradoxically, have also been major backers of Trump’s presidential campaigns. Donald Trump’s extension of the deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico by another 90 days is fuelling speculation that he could announce pauses for dozens of other countries that face punitive higher import duties from tomorrow. As the countdown continues to his deadline for a trade deal – already extended by four weeks from the original 90 days – the US president said he had made the decision to offer more time to Mexico because of the complexities of the trading relationship. “We will be talking to Mexico over the next 90 Days with the goal of signing a Trade Deal somewhere within the 90 Day period of time, or longer,” he wrote on social media. A little more than two weeks ago Trump threatened both the EU and Mexico with tariffs of 30% on most exports to the US, but last Sunday he concluded a deal with Brussels with a 15% baseline rate from 1 August. Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump said: “I have just concluded a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, which was very successful in that, more and more, we are getting to know and understand each other. “The complexities of a Deal with Mexico are somewhat different than other Nations because of both the problems, and assets, of the Border. “We have agreed to extend, for a 90 Day period, the exact same Deal as we had for the last short period of time, namely, that Mexico will continue to pay a 25% Fentanyl Tariff, 25% Tariff on Cars, and 50% Tariff on Steel, Aluminum, and Copper.” Former vice-president Kamala Harris has given her first interview since last year’s election to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS tonight at 11.35pm ET. It comes a day after she announced that she won’t run for governor of California next year. As my colleague Lauren Gambino wrote: “Harris’s decision throws open the race for California’s governorship, a post seen as a critical bulwark against Trump’s agenda. “It also leaves open the possibility that Harris could run again for political office. She did not rule out another run for the White House, saying only that “for now, my leadership – and public service – will not be in elected office”. Harris also announced today that she’s set to release a memoir about her brief 2024 presidential run on 23 September. Earlier this month, CBS owner Paramount announced it was canceling Colbert’s show amid a political firestorm, with Trump revelling in the the country’s top-rated late-night talk show host’s firing. Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum said in a post on X: We had a very good call with the President of the United States, Donald Trump. We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow and secured 90 days to build a long-term agreement through dialogue. Donald Trump and Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum have spoken on the phone this morning as Mexico seeks an agreement with its biggest trading partner ahead of Trump’s 1 August deadline. “Mexico will continue to pay a 25% Fentanyl Tariff, 25% Tariff on Cars, and 50% Tariff on Steel, Aluminum, and Copper. Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. Trump said his administration would continue talking to Mexico over the next 90 days (“or longer”) with the goal of signing a trade deal. He had previously threatened Mexico with a 30% tariff rate. Here are some of the ways that Democratic senators say Doge managed to waste $21.7bn: Paying about 200,000 federal employees not to work for as much as eight months, under the Deferred Resignation Program. This had the largest price tag, at $14.8bn. Also expensive was firing or putting on long-term administrative leave another 100,000-plus workers, which cost $6.1bn. The emails that some federal workers were required to send detailing what they had done each week cost $155m and amounted to “millions of hours of wasted time”, according to the report. Donald Trump’s decision to freeze grants cost the energy department $263m in lost income from grants and fees for utility projects “supporting energy affordability and grid resilience,” the report said. The food aid and medical supplies Trump refuses to distribute and now intends to destroy will cost $110m. Democrats on a Senate investigative committee have blasted Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency (Doge) initiative for wasting money, paying hundreds of thousands of federal employees not to work and doing little to accomplish its stated goals. The report from Democrats on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is titled “The $21.7b Blunder”, and accuses Trump, Doge and its former head Elon Musk of wasting that amount of money by rapidly dismantling government functions without bothering to understand how they work. “With Elon Musk at its head for its first four months, it is unsurprising that DOGE modeled itself on a defunct corporate motto, seeking to ‘move fast and break things,’” the report reads. “Yet DOGE seems to have stopped there, never taking the time to fix — let alone understand— the things it had broken. By prioritizing disruption over governance and failing to identify solutions for any of the problems it purported to solve, DOGE has created its own forms of waste.” You can read the report here. Here’s more from the Guardian’s Sam Levine and George Chidi about the plans by Texas’s Republican-dominated legislature to redraw their congressional maps ahead of next year’s midterm elections, which have sparked outrage among Democrats and threats of retaliation: Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map in Texas that would allow the party to pick up as many as five additional congressional seats, an aggressive maneuver that has already met decisive outcry from Democrats and comes as the GOP tries to stave off losses in next year’s midterm elections. Republicans already hold 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats. But at the urging of Donald Trump, Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, called a special session this month to redraw the state’s congressional districts. After contentious hearings across the state, Republicans unveiled their proposed map on Wednesday. “We expected them to be greedy,” said Sam Gostomski, executive director of the Texas Democratic party. “The bottom line is, they are going to turn Texas into almost certainly the most gerrymandered state in the country.” Had the map been in place for the 2024 election, Trump would have carried 30 of the districts, while Kamala Harris would have carried just eight, according to data from Dave’s Redistricting App, an online tool that allows for analysis of voting districts. Today we’ll also be keeping an eye on House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries who has been in Texas, meeting with Democrats in the state, as a redistricting showdown ensues. Yesterday, state Republicans released their proposed congressional map which would allow the GOP to pick up five seats in the state. They already hold 25 of Texas’ 38 congressional districts. Jeffries is expected to hold a press conference later today. Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, is in Israel today meeting with prime minister Netanyahu. This will be Witkoff’s first public visit to Israel since May, and comes as the starvation crisis in Gaza escalates. It also comes as a number of allies – including Canada, France and the UK say they will reconginise Palestinian statehood if Israel fails to address the worsening humanitarian crisis and agree to a ceasefire with Hamas. Follow along with the latest updates in the region here. In response to the failed Senate vote yesterday to block arms sales to Israel, a number of lawmakers have reacted. Particularly senators who have grown increasingly concerned with Israel’s actions and the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Democratic senator Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware joined senator Duckworth as a new supporter of suspending military sales to Israel. She said that “until Israel significantly shifts its military posture to end the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank, I cannot in good conscience support further military aid and arms sales to Israel.” Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin also explained his vote with similar reasoning. “Prime minister Netanyahu has gone too far. The humanitarian conditions in Gaza are appalling, unconscionable, and cruel,” Durbin said in a statement. However, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer voted “no” to block arms sales, adding that “I have also long held that security assistance to Israel is not about any one government but about our support for the Israeli people.” • This post was amended on 1 August 2025. Lisa Blunt Rochester is a senator from Delaware, not Maryland as an earlier version said. Meanwhile Trump posted on Truth Social today that the “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” This comes after his remarks earlier this week acknowledging that there is “real starvation in Gaza.” An apparent break from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s who claims there is no starvation. Earlier this month the World Health Organization said there have been 63 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza in July. 24 of them are children under the age of five. A vote to block arms sales to Israel failed in the Senate late yesterday. But the effort, spearheaded by Senator Bernie Sanders, did see 12 new Democrats vote to stop the sale of American weapons to Israel. One of them is Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois –who served as a US army helicopter pilot in the Iraq war. She explained her decision in a statement: My votes tonight reflect my deep frustration with the Netanyahu government’s abject failure to address humanitarian needs in Gaza and send a message to the Trump Administration that it must change course if it wants to help end this devastating war. One the eve of Trump’s tariff deadline, a federal appeals court will hear arguments from businesses who claim taxes on foreign imports are proving destructive. The plaintiffs claim the president sidestepped congressional approval when he implemented his “liberation day” tairffs back in April. Earlier, the President took to Truth Social to wish his legal team luck: To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America’s big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE “DEAD,” WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter! My colleague Ed Pilkington has more on the background of the case here Donald Trump is at the White House today. His schedule includes lunch with JD Vance, the vice-president, followed by an executive order signing at 4pm EST. Also on the agenda today Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, will hold a briefing at around 1pm EST. The United States believes it has the makings of a trade deal with China, but it is “not 100% done,” Scott Bessent told CNBC in an interview, adding that he would talk to Donald Trump later on Thursday. The US treasury secretary also said he did not know what would happen with trade with India, saying it had “not been a great global actor”. Donald Trump again criticised Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday, a day after the US central bank held interest rates steady in a 9-2 vote. In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: Jerome “Too Late” Powell has done it again!!! He is TOO LATE, and actually, TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, &amp; TOO POLITICAL, to have the job of Fed Chair. He is costing our Country TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, in addition to one of the most incompetent, or corrupt, renovations of a building(s) in the history of construction! Put another way, “Too Late” is a TOTAL LOSER, and our Country is paying the price! The US Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, even amid intense pressure from Donald Trump to lower rates. Despite an onslaught of attacks from the White House against the Fed, officials at the central bank said that economic “uncertainty” remains too high to lower rates. But two of the Fed’s governors voted against the decision – the first time that multiple governors have voted against the majority since 1993. Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed by Trump, wanted rates to be lowered. Both have been floated as potential replacements for Fed chair Jerome Powell. Data released on Wednesday underlined the resilience of the US economy, which bounced back faster than expected in the second quarter. US gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to the latest official data, ahead of the average 2.5% forecast from economists. This marked a significant acceleration from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, which was dragged down by a surge of imports as companies tried to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs. But the rebound was boosted by a 30% slump in imports. Trump used the news to once again call for a rate cut and again insulted Powell, whom he has nicknamed “Too Late”. “2Q GDP JUST OUT: 3%, WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED! ‘Too Late’ MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!” he wrote on Truth Social. President Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped a 50% tariff on most Brazilian goods to fight what he has called a “witch hunt” against former president Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies. Trump announced the tariffs, some of the steepest levied on any economy in the US trade war, as his administration also unveiled sanctions on the Brazilian supreme court justice who has been overseeing Bolsonaro’s trial on charges of plotting a coup, Reuters reported. “Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against US and Brazilian citizens and companies,” Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. Bessent said Moraes “is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions” including against former president Jair Bolsonaro.” Last week, the Brazilian justice levied search warrants and restraining orders against Bolsonaro over allegations he courted Trump’s interference in his criminal case, in which he is accused of plotting to stop President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in 2023. The Trump administration is pushing an initiative for millions of Americans to upload personal health data and medical records on new apps and systems run by private tech companies, promising easier to access health records and wellness monitoring. The new system will focus on diabetes and weight management, conversational artificial intelligence that helps patients, and digital tools such as QR codes and apps that register patients for check-ins or track medications. The initiative, spearheaded by an administration that has already freely shared highly personal data about Americans in ways that have tested legal bounds, could put patients’ desires for more convenience at their doctor’s office on a collision course with their expectations that their medical information be kept private. “There are enormous ethical and legal concerns,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. “Patients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.” President Donald Trump said that the United States has done very little business with India, and that Russia and the US do almost no business together. “I don’t care what India does with Russia”, he said in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding that “they can take their dead economies down together, for all I care”. In an earlier Truth Social post on Wednesday Trump talked about India’s trade with Russia when announcing the US would impose a 25% tariff on goods imported from India starting on Friday. In response to the earlier Truth Social post, the Indian government said it was studying the implications of Trump’s announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal. Trump said that India has always bought a vast majority of their military equipment and energy from Russia, which was “not good”. The US tariff rate on Malaysian goods will be announced on Friday, Malaysian premier Anwar Ibrahim said on Thursday after speaking to US president Donald Trump. Malaysia is facing a 25% tariff on its exports to the United States unless a deal with Washington is reached by Friday. The two countries have held multiple rounds of talks, with Malaysia’s trade minister saying several sticking points remained, particularly on non-trade barriers. Anwar said he discussed tariffs “in the spirit and principle of free trade” during a phone conversation with Trump early on Thursday. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the US will charge a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea, down from a threatened 25%, as part of a deal that eases tensions with a top-10 trading partner and key Asian ally. South Korea also agreed to invest $350 billion in the United States in projects selected by Trump and to purchase energy products worth $100 billion, Reuters reported. The arrangement, announced after Trump met with Korean officials at the White House, came during a blizzard of trade policy announcements. Many countries are rushing to cut deals ahead of 1 August, when Trump has promised higher tariffs will kick in. “I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The negotiations were an early test for South Korean president Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June after a snap election. He said the deal eliminated uncertainty and set US tariffs lower than or at the same level as major competitors. “We have crossed a big hurdle,” Lee said in a Facebook post. Trump said Lee would visit the White House “within the next two weeks” for his first meeting with the U.S. president. South Korea will accept American products, including autos and agricultural goods into its markets and impose no import duties on them, Trump added. South Korea’s top officials said the country’s rice and beef markets would not be opened further, and discussions over US demands on food regulations continue. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of US politics as Donald Trump intensified his trade war with Canada a day ahead of his 1 August deadline for a tariff agreement. The president posted on his Truth Social platform: Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!! Trump is set to impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement if the two countries do not reach an agreement by the deadline. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney previously said tariff negotiations with Washington had been constructive, but the talks may not conclude by the deadline. Canada is the second-largest US trading partner after Mexico, and the largest buyer of US exports. Carney followed France and Britain as he said on Wednesday that his country was planning to recognize Palestine at a meeting of the United Nations in September. We’ll be bringing you all the developments on this story today. In other news: Trump has said the US will charge a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea as part of an agreement with the key Asian trading partner and ally that avoids even higher levies. In contrast on Wednesday, Trump placed 25% tariffs on imports from India and 50% on those from Brazil. Brown University has reached an agreement with the Trump administration that will reinstate nearly $50m in research funding by agreeing a commitment to nondiscrimination in both admissions and campus programs, and will grant federal officials access to its admissions data. Meanwhile $108m in federal research funding to Duke University has been frozen. The US Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, even amid intense pressure from Trump to lower rates. Earlier in the day, figures showed US gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 3% in the second quarter of 2025. Kamala Harris announced on Wednesday that she will not run for governor of California – a highly anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the country’s largest blue state wide open.
