  Káťa Kabanová review – furtive groping and a wing-bloodied angel stalk flawed
  staging of Janáček’s opera

  The final production of the current Glyndebourne season is a revival of
  Damiano Michieletto’s staging of Janáček’s Káťa Kabanová, first seen in 2021,
  as the UK emerged from lockdown, with the cast socially distanced on stage and
  a reduced orchestration used in the pit. Now, of course, conductor Robin
  Ticciati reverts to Janáček’s original score. I didn’t see Michieletto’s
  original, however, and so cannot tell how much may have changed dramatically.
  An inconsistent staging, it transforms an essentially naturalistic work into a
  symbolist exploration of its heroine’s mind, and an opera essentially about
  the darkness of the human soul, is now reimagined in antiseptic, clinical
  white. There’s little suggestion of the natural world that mirrors the central
  crisis, only a phosphorescent glare seen between the cracks of the white walls
  that hem Kateřina Kněžíková’s Káťa in. Michieletto is unsparing in his
  depiction of Kabanicha’s (Susan Bickley) abuse, yet at the same time, the
  social background is curiously vague here, and we lose sight of Káťa’s tragedy
  as emblematic of conflicts between reactionary authoritarianism and emerging
  liberalism. Instead, Michieletto realises her dreams and fantasies. She
  imagines flying free like a bird, though bird cages, proliferating on stage,
  only serve to enhance her growing sense of entrapment. The angel she dreamt of
  in church as a child, now stalks her adult imagination, wounded, its wings
  bloodied. This ambivalent figure, male and stripped to the waist in 2021, has
  now become female androgynous and Byzantine, though the image is overused. Its
  feathers flutter down as Kněžíková yields to Nicky Spence’s Boris, though
  Michieletto ruins the subsequent love scene by bringing Bickley on stage to
  pluck the angel’s wings and immure it in a cage, a horrendous distraction.
  Michieletto doesn’t always trust the score: in Act I, the exquisite passage
  intended to mark Káťa’s first appearance now accompanies furtive groping
  between Sam Furness’s Kudrjáš and Rachael Wilson’s Varvara, leaving Kněžíková
  to slope on a few minutes later, though we have already seen her during the
  prelude. Much of it sounds extremely fine, however, though Ticciati,
  conducting the London Philharmonic, is perhaps stronger on the score’s
  lyricism than its incipient violence: the close of Act I, and indeed the
  climactic storm that unhinges Káťa’s mind, could have been more tense than
  they were on opening night. Kněžíková is really lovely in the title role, her
  tone silvery yet warm, her dynamic control immaculate, vivid in her
  delineation of Káťa’s inner conflict. Spence sounds wonderfully ardent, but by
  the end we are also painfully aware of Boris’s essential cowardice and
  weakness of will. Bickley, tremendous here, gives us her most terrifying
  Kabanicha yet. Furness and Wilson, meanwhile, are just delightful as the
  couple who manage to escape the nightmare that surrounds them. A flawed
  production, but finely sung. • In repertory until 23 August
