  Japan has opened its first osmotic power plant, in the south-western city of
  Fukuoka. Only the second power plant of its type in the world, it is expected
  to generate about 880,000 kilowatt hours of electricity each year – enough to
  help power a desalination plant that supplies fresh water to the city and
  neighbouring areas. That’s the equivalent of powering about 220 Japanese
  households, according to Dr Ali Altaee from the University of Technology
  Sydney (UTS), who specialises in the development of alternative water sources.
  While it is still an emerging technology being used only on a modest scale as
  yet, it does have an advantage over some other renewable energies in that it
  is available around the clock, regardless of the wind or weather or other
  conditions. It relies simply on the mixing of fresh and salt water, so the
  energy flow can continue day and night, providing a steady source of
  electricity. So what is osmotic power and could it be used elsewhere? What is
  osmotic power? Osmosis is the natural process where water moves across a
  semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more
  concentrated one, in an attempt to balance the concentration on both sides.
  Picture a cup divided vertically by a thin, semi-permeable layer – if one side
  holds salty water and the other side pure freshwater, the water will flow
  towards the salty side to dilute it, because the salt itself cannot pass
  through the membrane. Osmotic power plants use this same principle, by placing
  freshwater and seawater on either side of a special membrane, with the
  seawater slightly pressurised. As water flows across to the saltier side, it
  increases the volume of pressurised solution, which can then be harnessed to
  produce energy. In the Fukuoka facility, fresh water – or treated wastewater –
  and seawater are placed on either side of a membrane. As the side with
  seawater increases in pressure and decreases in salinity, some of the water is
  channelled through a turbine that is connected to a generator, producing
  power. Where else is the technology being used? The Fukuoka plant is the
  second of its kind in the world. The first one was built in 2023 in Mariager,
  Denmark, by the venture company SaltPower, said University of Melbourne Prof
  Sandra Kentish. The Japanese power plant is larger than the one in Denmark,
  according to Dr Altaee, although they have almost the same operating capacity.
  Pilot-scale demonstrations have also taken place in Norway and South Korea.
  Altaee said UTS has its own prototype in Sydney, but the program lost traction
  during Covid. He has also helped build prototypes in Spain and Qatar. What are
  the challenges? While the idea is simple, scaling it up is difficult. Kentish
  said a lot of energy is lost through the action of pumping water into the
  power plant and when it travels through the membranes. “While energy is
  released when the salt water is mixed with fresh water, a lot of energy is
  lost in pumping the two streams into the power plant and from the frictional
  loss across the membranes. This means that the net energy that can be gained
  is small,” she said. But advances in membrane and pump technology are reducing
  these problems, Kentish said. “It is also noteworthy that the Japanese plant
  uses concentrated seawater, the brine left after removal of fresh water in a
  desalination plant, as the feed, which increases the difference in salt
  concentrations and thus the energy available.” What does this mean for the
  future? Kentish and Altaee agree that the Japanese plant marks an exciting
  moment for osmotic power, because it offers further proof that the technology
  can be used for large-scale energy production. Altaee said the prototype plant
  at Australian university UTS could be restarted if government funding became
  available, raising its potential for larger-scale implementation in Australia,
  similar to that of the plant in Fukuoka. “We have salt lakes around New South
  Wales and Sydney that could be used as a resource and we also have the
  expertise to build it.”
