  The owner of OnlyFans was paid $701m (£523m) in dividends last year as the
  subscription service best known for offering adult content positions itself
  for a potential multibillion-dollar sale. The payment to Leonid Radvinsky, the
  Ukrainian-American entrepreneur behind the streaming platform, adds to the
  more than $1bn in dividends he has already received from the business as he
  profits from connecting porn stars and celebrities more directly with their
  audiences. OnlyFans accounts show it paid $497m in dividends to its parent,
  Fenix International, which is owned by Radvinsky, in 2024, up from $472m in
  its 2023 financial year. The business paid a further $204m to its owner in
  five tranches over the course of December to April. The UK-based company
  reported revenue of $1.4bn in its 2024 financial year, up 9% compared with the
  year before, the accounts filed at Companies House on Friday show. Pre-tax
  profit rose 4% to $683.6m. It comes after reports in May that Fenix had held
  talks to sell the business for $8bn to a consortium of investors led by the
  Forest Road Company, a US investment firm. More people than ever are using the
  platform, with the total number of creator accounts – which split their
  proceeds 80:20 with the business – up by 13% to 4.6m. The total number of fan
  accounts grew by 24% to 377.5m. Overall, OnlyFans took in $7.2bn from its
  subscribers in 2024, up from $6.6bn the previous year. The company said
  “significant growth and profitability” had been driven by an increase in
  platform users and higher earnings for existing creators. The platform’s chief
  executive, Keily Blair, a former privacy lawyer who joined the business three
  years ago, said OnlyFans had “expanded in new verticals, demonstrating the
  strength and potential of the platform across a wide range of genres” in the
  year. The platform was founded in 2016 by the British entrepreneur Tim
  Stokely, then 33 years old. It was sold to Radvinsky, a previous owner of
  adult websites, for an undisclosed sum in 2018. While its largest market is in
  the US, OnlyFans remains headquartered in London. The business has millions of
  creators on its platform, but employs just 46 people directly. Radvinsky has a
  low public profile, although his personal website states that he holds a
  degree in economics from Northwestern University in the US and lives in
  Florida. He describes himself as a venture capital investor. Before acquiring
  OnlyFans he owned an adult webcam business. OnlyFans also noted in its
  accounts that it continued to invest in its trust and safety measures, amid
  tighter online safety rules in the UK. While the platform offers a variety of
  different content genres outside pornography, including sports and lifestyle,
  it has a strict 18+ age limit.
