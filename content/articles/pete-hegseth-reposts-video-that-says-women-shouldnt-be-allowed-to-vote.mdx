  The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, recently shared a video in which
  several pastors say women should no longer be allowed to vote, prompting one
  progressive evangelical organization to express concern. Hegseth reposted a
  CNN segment on X on Thursday that focuses on pastor Doug Wilson, a Christian
  nationalist who co-founded the Idaho-based Communion of Reformed Evangelical
  Churches (CREC), In the segment, he raises the idea of women not voting. “I
  would like to see this nation being a Christian nation, and I would like this
  world to be a Christian world,” Wilson said. Another pastor interview by CNN
  for its segment, Toby Sumpter, said: “In my ideal society, we would vote as
  households. I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast
  the vote having discussed it with my household.” A congregant interviewed for
  the segment remarked that she considers her husband as the head their
  household, and added: “I do submit to him.” Hegseth reposted the nearly
  seven-minute report with the caption: “All of Christ for All of Life.” Later
  in the video, Wilson says he does not believe women should hold leadership
  positions in the military or be able to fill high-profile combat roles. A
  statement from Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell on Saturday said Hegseth “is
  a proud member of a church affiliated with” the CREC. “The secretary very much
  appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings.” Hegseth and his
  family were in attendance at the Wilson church’s inaugural service in
  Washington in July, according to CNN. Doug Pagitt, a pastor and the executive
  director of the progressive evangelical organization Vote Common Good, told
  the Associated Press that the ideas in the video are views that “small fringes
  of Christians keep” and said it was “very disturbing” that Hegseth would
  amplify them. Hegseth’s repost on Thursday came as the Trump administration
  ramps up efforts to promote Christian nationalism. The push follows Donald
  Trump’s renewed alliance with the Christian right in his second presidential
  term, whose moves have included an executive order creating a federal
  taskforce to investigate what he calls “anti-Christian bias” in government
  agencies. The president also created a White House faith office in February,
  saying it would make recommendations to him “regarding changes to policies,
  programs and practices” and consult with outside experts in “combating
  antisemitic, anti-Christian and additional forms of anti-religious bias”. In
  May, Hegseth invited his personal pastor, Brooks Potteiger, to the Pentagon to
  lead the first of several Christian prayer services that the defense secretary
  has held inside the government building during working hours. Defense
  department employees and service members said they received invitations to the
  event in their government emails. The US constitution’s first amendment
  prohibits the government from establishing a state religion. But the US
  courts’ administrative office says the precise definition of “establishment”
  in that context historically has been unclear, especially with the
  constitution also protecting all citizens’ right to practice their religion
  generally as they please. Associated Press contributed reporting
