  South Korea’s vital statistics GDP per capita per annum: US$34,640 (global
  average $14,210) Total annual tonnes CO2: 577.42.m (tenth highest country) CO2
  per capita: 11.16 metric tonnes (global average 4.7) Most recent NDC (carbon
  plan): 2021 Climate plans: highly insufficient On a cool early morning on
  South Korea’s east coast, Eunbin Kang pointed to a monument to a vanishing
  era. The 2.1GW Samcheok Blue power plant which came online in South Korea in
  January looms out of the headlands above a beach made internationally famous
  by a K-pop album shoot. It is expected to emit 13m tonnes of CO2 annually,
  while its lifespan could stretch beyond 2050, the year by which the country
  has pledged to reach carbon neutrality. The country was building coal-fired
  power plants, said Kang, an activist who heads the Youth Climate Emergency
  Action group and relocated to this city to oppose the facility, “even as the
  climate emergency demands an immediate halt to fossil fuel expansion”. But
  Samcheok is not an outlier. It is a symbol of the stark climate contradiction
  at the heart of the world’s 12th largest economy, celebrated for its
  technological prowess in semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries, yet
  among the top ten worst global climate performers. Despite South Korea’s
  impressive climate pledges to reach net zero by 2050 with a 40% reduction in
  emissions from 2018 levels by 2030, fossil fuels still dominate its energy
  mix: 60% of electricity comes from coal and gas, while renewables make up just
  9%, a quarter of the OECD average of 34%. Monopoly strangling transition At
  the heart of South Korea’s climate failure is an energy model based on a state
  monopoly and central planning. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco), the
  state-owned energy company, controls transmission, distribution and retail,
  while its subsidiaries dominate generation, creating structural challenges for
  competitors. These include Korea South-East Power, Korea Western Power and
  four other generation subsidiaries that together operate the vast majority of
  the country’s coal, gas and nuclear power plants. Meanwhile, renewable energy
  developers face an obstacle course of regulatory barriers. Until recently,
  windfarm developers had to obtain 28 different permits from multiple
  ministries in a bureaucratic maze which created years of delays and
  significantly increased project costs, making many otherwise viable
  developments financially unfeasible. Progress was made in early 2025 with the
  passage of a long-awaited bill aimed at streamlining approvals, although the
  law won’t take effect until 2026. Grid connection remains another hurdle.
  While electricity demand has grown by 98% over the past two decades, the
  transmission network has expanded by just 26%, but attempts to expand the grid
  have led to bitter local conflicts. In Miryang, South Gyeongsang province, the
  government tried to compel residents to sell up to clear space for
  transmission towers and people faced violent crackdowns during a six-year
  standoff. Currently, a dozen such projects are stalled in the country. In
  February 2025, the National Assembly passed a Power Grid Special Act aimed at
  expanding transmission. But civic groups warn the law reinforces the country’s
  decades-old top-down model of infrastructure development, removing what few
  safeguards remained around public consultation and environmental review. “We
  fully acknowledge that renewable energy transition requires transmission
  lines,” says Kim Jeong-jin from Friends of the Earth in Dangjin, where one
  project faced more than 10 years of delays due to local opposition. “But the
  repeated conflicts arise because the electricity is not even for local use,
  yet it causes damage to our region without any regard for our voices.” The
  country’s energy strategy is guided by the Basic Plan for Electricity Supply
  and Demand, a 15-year forecast revised every two years. But the framework,
  which dates back to the 1960s, still prioritises centralised, large-scale
  power generation – a model built for coal and nuclear, and fundamentally
  incompatible with today’s decentralised, flexible renewable technologies.
  Political volatility worsens the problem. Each five-year presidential term
  brings a policy reversal. For instance, in 2017, President Moon Jae-in
  announced a nuclear phase-out; his successor, the now disgraced ex-president
  Yoon Suk Yeol, reversed course five years later. This whiplash undermines any
  long-term planning for renewables – a problem faced by democracies around the
  world. The consequences are stark. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent
  fossil fuel prices soaring, Kepco incurred enormous losses. In 2022 alone,
  South Korea faced an extra 22tn won (£11.9 bn) in LNG power costs. Yet the
  government kept electricity prices artificially low, a political choice that
  pushed Kepco’s debt to a staggering 205tn won (£111bn) by 2024. Despite this
  crisis, meaningful reform remains elusive. This entrenched monopoly system has
  effectively blocked the clean energy transition, with independent renewable
  producers struggling to gain meaningful access to a market dominated by fossil
  fuel interests. Carbon-intensive by design More broadly, South Korea’s postwar
  rise relied on energy-intensive industries: steel, petrochemicals,
  shipbuilding and semiconductors. “This structural dependency on heavy and
  chemical industries makes the energy transition extraordinarily difficult,”
  says Park Sangin, a professor of economics at Seoul National University.
  “These industries are deeply embedded in the country’s economic fabric and
  require vast amounts of stable, cheap electricity.” Powerful chaebols, or
  family-controlled conglomerates like Posco, Samsung and Hyundai, exert
  outsized influence on national policy. Their operations are supported by an
  electricity market designed for industrial stability, not climate mitigation.
  And the problem isn’t just domestic; South Korea also finances and provides
  the infrastructure for fossil fuels globally. South Korean shipbuilders
  dominate the global market for LNG carriers. Public financial institutions
  also bankroll overseas fossil fuel projects. One that was recently approved,
  the Coral Norte gas project in Mozambique, is projected to emit 489m tonnes of
  CO2 across its lifecycle. At the same time, South Korea has emerged as one of
  the world’s top importers of Russian fossil fuels, even as other nations cut
  ties. “This financing directly contradicts [South] Korea’s climate targets and
  makes a mockery of the Paris Agreement,” says Dongjae Oh, the head of the gas
  team at Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). “It exposes the country’s hypocrisy
  – adopting climate targets at home while funding climate destruction abroad.”
  Even climate-friendly institutions continue backing fossil fuels. The National
  Pension Service (NPS), one of the world’s largest pension funds, remains a
  major investor in coal and gas projects, despite a 2021 “coal-free”
  declaration. Three and a half years after this announcement, NPS only
  finalised its coal divestment strategy in December 2024, with a timeline that
  will delay implementation for domestic assets until 2030. Meanwhile, South
  Korea’s market-based climate policies have failed to drive meaningful change.
  The emissions trading scheme (K-ETS) was supposed to put a price on carbon
  when it launched in 2015. But the system, which hands out free allowances to
  the largest companies, has instead created perverse incentives, according to
  campaign group Plan 1.5. The group carried out an analysis and found that
  South Korea’s 10 largest polluters have made over 475bn won (£258m) from
  selling unused carbon credits between 2015 and 2022. The system that was meant
  to make polluters pay has instead rewarded them. Next generation fights back
  There is growing awareness of a climate crisis as the country begins to
  experience increasingly severe weather. In 2023 46 people died in floods that
  displaced thousands. More recently, torrential rains have again caused at
  least 26 deaths, followed by a record-breaking heatwave. In March this year
  devastating wildfires swept across more than 48,000 hectares (118,610 acres) –
  roughly 80% of the area of Seoul – killing 31 people and destroying thousands
  of homes. The country’s disaster chief described the situation as “a climate
  crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced before”. The prime minister, Kim
  Min-seok, has described the climate crisis as “the new normal”. Now a new
  generation of South Koreans is challenging the status quo through legal
  action. In February, a group of children gathered outside Posco’s office in
  Seoul. Among them was 11-year-old Yoohyun Kim, the youngest plaintiff in a
  groundbreaking lawsuit against Posco. The case aims to block the company’s
  plan to reline an old coal-fired blast furnace, a move that would extend its
  life by 15 years and emit an estimated 137m tonnes of CO2. “I came here during
  my precious winter break, my last as an elementary school student, because I
  want to protect all four seasons,” Yoohyun told supporters. “Spring and autumn
  are disappearing with climate change – and with them, the chance for children
  like me to play freely outside.” The lawsuit is the first of its kind globally
  to target traditional blast furnace production. It follows a crucial ruling by
  South Korea’s constitutional court last August which found that the
  government’s climate policies violated the rights of future generations by
  failing to set legally binding targets for 2031-50. In March, residents and
  activists filed another suit over the government’s approval of the world’s
  largest semiconductor cluster in Yongin, backed by a 360tn won (£195bn)
  Samsung investment. The suit argues that the project’s 10GW electricity demand
  and new LNG plants contradict climate regulations and corporate sustainability
  commitments. Jungwon Kim, a youth activist, sees this as a generational
  struggle. “Growing up in Pohang, I saw smokestacks fill the sky on my way to
  school every day. My throat would hurt from fine dust, and iron particles
  would collect on our windowsills,” she recalls. “Adults always said: ‘Thanks
  to Posco, our region survives.’ I don’t want my child to grow up with that
  same false choice between a healthy environment and economic survival.” The
  international data shows that South Korea’s emissions peaked in 2018, and have
  been falling, with a brief jump after Covid, ever since. The government
  maintains that it is making progress on its climate goals, although critics
  argue that it is relying on some wonky calculations around its 2030 emission
  reduction target, confusing net with gross emissions. “South Korea is actively
  pursuing bold reduction of coal power generation through prohibiting new
  permits for coal power plants and phasing out ageing facilities,” the ministry
  said in a statement, arguing that any remaining coal plants operating beyond
  2050, such as those approved before the 2021 ban, would be addressed through
  “carbon capture and storage technology and clean fuel conversion” in a way
  “not inconsistent with our carbon neutrality commitment”. But independent
  analysis suggests these measures fall well short. “The Basic Plan has no
  specific plan for how to expand renewable energy,” says Prof Park. “There are
  vague targets, but no timeline, no locations. In stark contrast, the nuclear
  roadmap is extremely detailed and specific.” His recent research using the
  Global Change Assessment Model shows the current plan would fall short of
  meeting South Korea’s 2030 emissions targets by approximately 6-7%. A more
  ambitious policy focused on offshore wind expansion and a complete phase-out
  of coal by 2035 could not only meet climate goals but reduce power sector
  emissions by 82% by 2035. When confronted with criticisms of its emissions
  accounting, South Korea’s environment ministry defended its approach: “Our
  emissions reduction target calculation method considers international
  regulations and major country cases. Countries like Japan and Canada use
  similar calculation methods for their 2030 NDCs,” a spokesperson said. The
  ministry added that although previous targets used the older 1996 IPCC
  guidelines, from 2024 they have begun using the updated 2006 standards for
  national greenhouse gas statistics. Back in Samcheok, Eunbin Kang looks out at
  the coal plant that now dominates the coastal landscape. “I dream of a society
  where exploitation and plunder are replaced by decentralisation and autonomy,”
  she says. “I want to contribute to spreading lifestyles and policies that
  allow everyone to lead a good life without requiring a lot of electricity or
  money.” • This article was amended on 18 August 2025 to correct a conversion;
  475bn won is £258m, not £258bn as an earlier version said.
