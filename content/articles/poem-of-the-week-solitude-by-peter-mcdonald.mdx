  Solitude Paraphrase on Saint-John Perse, Anabase IV The gannet I found
  stranded in a car-park, something all wrong with its wings and its head too
  heavy for the neck to bear, beautiful bird, beautiful ugly bird. * Not the
  street-parties day and night tomorrow, but the morning after that, and the
  bin-men redding up shredded pieces of palm-trees like the débris of enormous
  wings. * The gannet’s eyes, the gannet’s big clown-face. * A touch of yellow,
  and the town in yellow light, close, damp, and heavy now with a storm coming;
  shadows that latch the streets, and windows open where dresses flap and hang,
  and never dry. * A great sea-going bird’s single blue egg. Peter McDonald
  makes exceptionally interesting use of the art of paraphrase in his 2024
  collection, One Little Room. He expands on the texts of a small but varied
  selection of authors, making the original a launch-pad to his uniquely
  different and contemporary planet. Anabase, by Saint-John Perse, translated
  from French to English by TS Eliot, has a particular hold on his imagination
  in this collection. In fact, its epigraph is from Anabase, canto 1: “et la mer
  au matin comme une présomption de l’esprit.” Eliot, the endnote reveals,
  translated this initially as “and the sea at morning like a pride of the
  spirit” before revising it to “and the sea at morning like a presumption of
  the mind”. Here’s the sea-phrase in its later context: “This husk of earth
  given over to our horses / delivers to us this incorruptible sky. The Sun is
  unmentioned but his power is amongst us / and the sea at morning like a
  presumption of the mind.” Perse’s 10-part allegory is set as prose, but,
  introducing it, Eliot is very firm in asserting it to be a poem: “Its
  sequences, its logic of imagery are those of poetry, not of prose.” He
  complains of the lack of an adequate term for such writing. The gap remains
  un-filled today: although we’d now want to mention the ‘prose-poem’ and,
  perhaps, the ‘lyric essay’, Perse’s sequence represents a distinct form.
  Anabase, also referred to as Anabasis, can be found here. In Anabase, IV, the
  “conqueror” who was only contemplating the building of a city in its first
  canto, has now reached the moment of its founding. McDonald dispenses with
  ancient grandeurs and takes us straight to the contemporary urban car park and
  the unfortunate gannet. Perse’s possibly mythical seabird is a very different
  creature. It appears only briefly at the end of the section. It seems to have
  made a lucky escape from the triumphant expressions of human achievement. From
  the perspective of McDonald’s speaker, the fun is nearly over for Earth’s
  conquerors. “Not the street-parties day and night tomorrow / But the morning
  after that.” We can assume that “the morning after” is now, or a period not
  far into the future, and it represents some wretched aftermath. There has been
  serious destruction – of “palm-trees” and “enormous wings” – for the bin-men
  to start “redding” up. The Scottish verb means “to make tidy”, but, as
  sound-association, it evokes the dropping of blood from the maimed wings. The
  morning light is lurid, the air “heavy” and threatening. The sight of the
  deformed gannet, a bird which has either suffered a horrible injury or
  represents some equally horrible genetic mutation, changes before our eyes,
  from “beautiful bird” to “beautiful ugly bird”. It may, like Baudelaire’s
  l’Albatros, also symbolise human forms of alienation. The bright treasure
  plucked from Anabase is the “single blue egg” of the second single-line verse,
  on which Solitude ends. This is Perse: “Solitude! the blue egg laid by a great
  sea-bird, and the bay-leaves at morning all laden with gold lemons! Yesterday
  it was! The bird made off!” Such rhetoric seems to indicate the conqueror’s
  excited ambition for further exploration and conquest. It belongs to a moment
  when rich achievement is gloried in, but with a certain sense of emptiness, a
  hunger that asks for more. In the paraphrase, there is a different note
  altogether, a sense that the bird has laid its egg at the wrong time and in
  the wrong place – a damp, grubby, exposed car-park with a storm on the way.
  The literary origins of the paraphrase are never stressed, but it’s their
  visibility in the last line which heightens the tragedy. The solitude of the
  title becomes overwhelming. The bird will die. The egg will fail to hatch.
  There will be no migration, no anabasis. Although the colour of the gannet’s
  egg may hint at a mythological being, I felt bereft at the end of the poem, as
  if I’d been made to witness the extinction of a species. Peter McDonald’s
  memorably read selection from One Little Room includes Solitude. The Good
  Morrow by John Donne, the source, as McDonald reminds us, of his collection’s
  title, may be read here.
