  Pick of the week Katrina: Come Hell and High Water Spike Lee executive
  produces a part elegy, part polemic commemoration of one of 2025’s saddest
  anniversaries: two decades have now passed since the brutal Hurricane Katrina
  laid waste to both the physical reality and also, somehow, the soul of New
  Orleans. The first part of this tragedy may have been unavoidable, given the
  force of the storm; the second element certainly wasn’t. Via some beautiful
  footage of pre-Katrina New Orleans at Mardi Gras time, this documentary series
  remembers the city as it once was. It also doesn’t hesitate to call out the
  trail of mendacity, negligence and incompetence that made the disaster – and
  its aftermath – so much worse than it needed to be. Netflix, from Wednesday 27
  August *** KPopped As the performer who, as he modestly puts it “brought K-pop
  to the world”, it’s fitting that Psy should present this cross-cultural light
  entertainment spectacular. Each episode sees western pop stars (including
  Spice Girls, Jess Glynne, Kylie Minogue and Kesha) collaborate with K-pop acts
  before performing head-to-head in a competition. The opening episode sees
  Megan Thee Stallion face off against Patti LaBelle, each backed by half of
  girl group Billie. It turns out that both Savage and Lady Marmalade work
  perfectly as K-pop bangers, even if Lady Marmalade was released before anyone
  else on the stage was born. Apple TV+, from Friday 29 August *** With Love,
  Meghan It is remarkable that something as bland as Meghan Markle’s lifestyle
  show could become a culture war. But, in defiance of the wishes of certain
  furious British tabloids and in celebration of her and Harry Windsor’s new
  deal with Netflix, Markle is back with yet more performative signifiers of
  pastel-coloured domestic bliss. It’s the usual assemblage of cooking,
  flower-arranging and crafting tips – basically, she really loves the idea of
  “finding new ways to show people you care”. Think Blue Peter for millionaires
  and you’re somewhere close. Netflix, from Tuesday 26 August *** Emma and Bruce
  Willis: The Unexpected Journey Bruce Willis officially retired from acting
  after his diagnosis with frontotemporal dementia in 2023. This tear-jerking
  interview sees his wife Emma Heming Willis sit down with Diane Sawyer to talk
  candidly about the impact of her husband’s illness on their life together. She
  also voices the hope that other people suffering from this cruel degenerative
  condition will be able to take some comfort from hearing it discussed openly.
  It is, by definition, an emotionally draining watch but the love Emma has for
  her husband is palpable. Disney+, from Wednesday 27 August *** The Terminal
  List: Dark Wolf Fans of the 2022 military drama The Terminal List are about to
  find out how Ben Edwards (Taylor Kitsch) and James Reece (Chris Pratt) got so
  messed up. This origin story takes us into the heart of the black ops mission
  at the root of their trauma. Reece is recruited to a covert anti-terrorist
  initiative but it becomes increasingly unclear who stands to gain from this
  plot. Soon, questions of loyalty threaten to derail the mission. It’s generic
  and deeply humourless, with a range encompassing enigmatic scowling,
  gratuitous gunplay and not much else besides. Prime Video, from Wednesday 27
  August *** Dating Naked Hosted by the very likable Rylan Clark, the second
  series of this dating show brings together 10 singletons, places them in an
  idyllic resort in Panama and asks them to shed their clothes and their
  inhibitions. It does its best to promote body positivity – all the
  participants admit to nervousness and one proclaims himself to be “average. I
  prefer going down the pub to going to the gym.” Once the initial gimmick has
  become familiarised, it settles down to become pretty routine. Never
  outrageous but sadly, never that interesting or revelatory either. Paramount+,
  from Friday 29 August *** Unknown Number: The High School Catfish The true
  story behind this documentary sounds uncannily like the plot outline for an
  overheated YA drama. A clean-cut and popular teenage couple at an American
  high school find themselves besieged by a relentless, mysterious cyberbully.
  Soon, everyone is a suspect. Even the FBI gets involved. But the actual
  identity of the bully wrongfoots them all. With access to the main players in
  the Michigan school where this scenario played out, this film is yet another
  remarkable and chilling cautionary tale of the digital age. Netflix, from
  Friday 29 August
