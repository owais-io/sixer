  Ethical Diamond appeared to have all of the attributes you would want to see
  in a potential Melbourne Cup winner as he recorded a decisive success in the
  Ebor Handicap at York on Saturday. He travelled sweetly, had the tactical
  speed to pick his way through the field in the straight and then a sharp turn
  of foot at the business end to put the race to bed a furlong out. In winning,
  he also picked up a “Golden Ticket” for “the race that stops the nation” in
  early November, one of just two such guaranteed entries on offer in the
  northern hemisphere. So what’s not to like? The answer, it soon transpired, is
  a small piece of metal inserted into one of Ethical Diamond’s legs. “He had a
  little fracture last year and we put a screw in,” Willie Mullins, the
  gelding’s trainer, said, “and they’re not allowed in Melbourne. It’s fair and
  their rules are there for a reason. At least we know we can’t go there before
  we leave.” Winning a Melbourne Cup is surely the most significant ambition
  left on Mullins’s to-do list now that he has won (and retained) the British
  trainers’ title over jumps, so the realisation that Ethical Diamond’s “Golden
  Ticket” is in effect worthless will have come as a blow. As he pointed out,
  though, he has at least been spared the expense and frustration endured by
  Aidan O’Brien in November 2024 when Jan Brueghel, the St Leger winner and
  Melbourne Cup favourite, was scratched by the Australian vets a few days
  before the race. O’Brien, who was in California for the Breeders’ Cup, was
  infuriated by the decision, as the result of what was described as a “shadow”
  on a scan. This, in the opinion of the local vets, meant that Jan Brueghel
  “was currently at heightened risk” of injury. “I would imagine that with any
  developing three-year-old at this time of the year, you would get shadows, and
  the same with human beings,” O’Brien said at the time. “It’s probably gone a
  little bit ridiculous but that’s the way it is. “One time when horses were
  trotted it was always the vet’s opinion whether they were sound or lame but
  now there’s an app on the phone and a phone video, and the phone tells the vet
  whether the horse is sound. There comes a time when it gets a little bit
  ridiculous.” Jan Brueghel was due to be O’Brien’s first Melbourne Cup runner
  since the introduction of heightened veterinary protocols for overseas
  competitors in 2021, a year after the same trainer’s Anthony Van Dyck, the
  Derby winner at Epsom in 2019, was put down after sustaining a broken fetlock
  during the Cup. He was the sixth overseas runner to suffer a fatal injury in
  the race since 2013. There was immense pressure on the Australian racing
  authorities to act, and to be seen to act, after such a sustained run of fatal
  injuries, and they can point to four subsequent injury-free runnings of the
  Melbourne Cup as a sign that the policy is proving to be effective. The fans
  have also been returning to the country’s most famous race over the last two
  years, from a low point of 73,816 in 2022 to 84,492 a year later and then
  91,168 in 2024. The Australian sporting public, it seems, is slowly learning
  to love its biggest race again. Four renewals of a single Flat race, though,
  is hardly conclusive evidence that the fatal injuries between 2013 and 2020
  were down to anything more than a run of bad luck. And though the Australian
  authorities, perhaps, may not be too concerned, this year’s Melbourne Cup will
  be a poorer race without Ethical Diamond cashing his Golden Ticket. The
  treatment of Jan Brueghel, meanwhile, whose abortive trip cost about £120,000,
  is also a potential disincentive for international runners. Over time, it may
  be, as the League of Gentlemen might put it, a more local race for local
  people. There is a potential lesson here for British racing, which has faced
  similar pressures to “do something” several times in the fairly recent past
  after abnormal clusters of fatal injuries at Cheltenham or Aintree in the
  spring. Saturday marked the start of the fifth National Racehorse Week, which
  actually runs for nine days until 31 August giving members of the public a
  chance to go behind the scenes at racing yards, stud farms and retraining
  centres around the country. The initiative is part of a broad strategy around
  welfare issues, which has included the founding of the independently chaired
  Horse Welfare Board and the development of data-based risk models in
  partnership with the Royal Veterinary College. It is proactive, not reactive,
  and focused on the overall picture, which is the only sensible approach given
  that racing will always carry an element of risk and also how easy it is to be
  fooled by randomness when what are essentially very unlikely events suddenly
  occur in clusters. The fact that a likely favourite can in effect be ruled out
  of Australia’s biggest race on vets’ advice because different vets have
  successfully treated an injury in the past should be a reminder of the
  possible drawbacks of trying to micro-manage risk, when the risk itself – 31
  deaths from 33,189 runners on the Flat in Britain in 2024 – is already
  extremely low.
