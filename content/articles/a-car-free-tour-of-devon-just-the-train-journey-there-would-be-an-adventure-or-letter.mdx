  Re Phoebe Taplin’s article (Coves, caves and Agatha Christie – a car-free tour
  along the English Riviera in Devon, 19 August), my in-laws live in Devon and
  we visit often from our home in the East Midlands. It is a long drive, with
  little to look at along the M6/M5, and Phoebe’s trip sounded so charming that
  I thought perhaps the train would provide us with an alternative. A quick look
  on a tickets app advises me that for the bargain price of £450 the four of us
  could travel to Torquay in seven hours and six minutes with four changes (each
  way), which would probably be an adventure in itself, possibly with fewer
  charming spots and seafood snacks. I could read an entire Christie novel in
  that time, however, provided the kids’ electronics stayed charged for long
  enough. Briony Mason Rowston, Lincolnshire
