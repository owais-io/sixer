  Dear Acting President Shipman, I am writing you an open letter since you have
  seen fit to communicate the recent decisions of the board of trustees and the
  administration in a similar fashion. These decisions, taken in close
  collaboration with the Trump administration, have made it impossible for me to
  teach modern Middle East history, the field of my scholarship and teaching for
  more than 50 years, 23 of them at Columbia. Although I have retired, I was
  scheduled to teach a large lecture course on this topic in the fall as a
  “special lecturer”, but I cannot do so under the conditions Columbia has
  accepted by capitulating to the Trump administration in June. Specifically, it
  is impossible to teach this course (and much else) in light of Columbia’s
  adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition
  of antisemitism. The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and
  disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of
  Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of
  Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA
  definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet
  Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary
  proceedings. Under this definition of antisemitism, which absurdly conflates
  criticism of a nation-state, Israel, and a political ideology, Zionism, with
  the ancient evil of Jew-hatred, it is impossible with any honesty to teach
  about topics such as the history of the creation of Israel, and the ongoing
  Palestinian Nakba, culminating in the genocide being perpetrated by Israel in
  Gaza with the connivance and support of the US and much of western Europe. The
  Armenian genocide, the nature of the absolute monarchies and military
  dictatorships that blight most of the Arab world, the undemocratic theocracy
  in Iran, the incipient dictatorial regime in Türkiye, the fanaticism of
  Wahhabism: all of these are subject to detailed analysis in my course lectures
  and readings. However, a simple description of the discriminatory nature of
  Israel’s 2018 Nation State Law – which states that only the Jewish people have
  the right of self-determination in Israel, half of whose subjects are
  Palestinian – or of the apartheid nature of its control over millions of
  Palestinians who have been under military occupation for 58 years would be
  impossible in a Middle East history course under the IHRA definition of
  antisemitism. It is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of
  speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat.
  Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion
  sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the
  constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus
  that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack
  down on alleged discrimination – which at this moment in history almost
  invariably amounts simply to opposition to this genocide. Scores of students
  and many faculty members have been subjected to these kangaroo courts,
  students such as Mahmoud Khalil have been snatched from their university
  housing, and Columbia has now promised to render this repressive system even
  more draconian and opaque. You have stated that no “red lines” have been
  crossed by these decisions. However, Columbia has appointed a vice-provost
  initially tasked with surveilling Middle Eastern studies, and it has ordained
  that faculty and staff must submit to “trainings” on antisemitism from the
  likes of the Anti-Defamation League, for whom virtually any critique of
  Zionism or Israel is antisemitic, and Project Shema, whose trainings link many
  anti-Zionist critiques to antisemitism. It has accepted an “independent”
  monitor of “compliance” of faculty and student behavior from a firm that in
  June 2025 hosted an event in honor of Israel. According to Columbia’s
  agreement with the Trump administration, this “Monitor will have timely access
  to interview all Agreement-related individuals, and visit all
  Agreement-related facilities, trainings, transcripts of Agreement-related
  meetings and disciplinary hearings, and reviews”. Classrooms are pointedly NOT
  excluded from possible visits from these external non academics. The idea that
  the teaching, syllabuses and scholarship of some of the most prominent
  academics in their fields should be vetted by such a vice-provost, such
  “trainers” or an outside monitor from such a firm is abhorrent. It constitutes
  the antithesis of the academic freedom that you have disingenuously claimed
  will not be infringed by this shameful capitulation to the anti-intellectual
  forces animating the Trump administration. I regret deeply that Columbia’s
  decisions have obliged me to deprive the nearly 300 students who have
  registered for this popular course – as many hundreds of others have done for
  more than two decades – of the chance to learn about the history of the modern
  Middle East this fall. Although I cannot do anything to compensate them fully
  for depriving them of the opportunity to take this course, I am planning to
  offer a public lecture series in New York focused on parts of this course that
  will be streamed and available for later viewing. Proceeds, if any, will go to
  Gaza’s universities, every one of which has been destroyed by Israel with US
  munitions, a war crime about which neither Columbia nor any other US
  university has seen fit to say a single word. Columbia’s capitulation has
  turned a university that was once a site of free inquiry and learning into a
  shadow of its former self, an anti-university, a gated security zone with
  electronic entry controls, a place of fear and loathing, where faculty and
  students are told from on high what they can teach and say, under penalty of
  severe sanctions. Disgracefully, all of this is being done to cover up one of
  the greatest crimes of this century, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, a crime in
  which Columbia’s leadership is now fully complicit. – Rashid Khalidi Rashid
