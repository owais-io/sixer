  As an art dealer in London and Miami, Inigo Philbrick had the Midas touch and
  lived the high life, with private jets, $5,000 bottles of wine and $7,000
  suits. But in 2019 he was exposed as a serial swindler who had created one of
  the largest art frauds in history, a Ponzi-style web of lies that conned
  collectors and investors. In 2022, aged 34, he was sentenced to seven years in
  a US prison, with two years of supervised release and an order “to pay
  forfeiture of $86,672,790”. Released from prison partway through his sentence
  last year, he claims not to know where the $86m is and expresses regret rather
  than remorse in a forthcoming BBC documentary. Asked whether he has the money,
  he replies with a grin: “No.” He says: “I’m obviously in no position to do
  anything other than say how sorry I am. But there is a small part of me that
  thinks: what about all the good deals?” He was interviewed for more than 14
  hours for a two-part, two-hour BBC documentary, The Great Art Fraud, to be
  released next week. The production also features Victoria Baker-Harber, a Made
  in Chelsea socialite with whom he fled Britain, hiding out on the Pacific
  island of Vanuatu, where he was eventually arrested by the FBI. She too
  downplays any wrongdoing: “You could say he’s a criminal, but who hasn’t done
  something illegal?” There is no suggestion that Baker-Harber was involved in
  Philbrick’s criminal activities and she did not face any legal action.
  Philbrick grew up in Connecticut, the son of a former museum director and a
  Harvard-educated writer and artist. Collectors and colleagues recall a
  “disarmingly charming” American, who established himself after rising quickly
  from an internship with the White Cube gallery in London. But he went on to
  run a business that engaged in fraudulent practices, selling more than 100% of
  an artwork to different investors without telling them and falsifying
  documents to inflate values. Judd Grossman, a New York lawyer representing
  several of Philbrick’s victims, including the collector Aleksandar Pesko,
  recalls that Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1982 painting Humidity was among
  multimillion-dollar works involved in the fraud: “Philbrick told Mr Pesko that
  he could acquire the [Basquiat] for $18.4m … Philbrick wasn’t buying it for
  $18.4m. He was actually getting it in a private sale … for $12.5m. To sell
  that lie, Philbrick forged documents to create the appearance of legitimacy.
  “He made up a contract. He even put into that contract the bank account
  information of a well-known New York law firm … They’ll tell you they had
  nothing to do with that deal.” Philbrick’s world came crashing down after he
  lied to German investors about Rudolf Stingel’s 2012 photorealist-style
  portrait of Pablo Picasso, telling them that the auction house Christie’s was
  offering a $9m guarantee on its sale. There was no guarantee and the hammer
  fell at $5.5m. Philbrick said: “I, from that very moment, was dead.” The
  Germans chased him for the missing millions. When they requested a copy of the
  guarantee, he had one faked. But they contacted Christie’s, who confirmed it
  was fraudulent. In the documentary, a tale of greed and of arrogance,
  Philbrick recalls the lure of money that was “literally shooting out of the
  ground around me”. Baker-Harber says: “I never really thought to myself, where
  is all of this money coming from? In a way, because it wasn’t really out of
  the norm for me, because I’ve had wealthy boyfriends before in the past …
  shopping, boats, planes.” She describes a debauched life: “We did a lot of
  parties, after-parties, after-after-after parties. Were there drugs? Yeah. Was
  it excessive? Yeah.” Philbrick says: “Have I drunk to excess? Yes, absolutely
  … there were moments of weakness, where I did phenomenally stupid things,
  decisions that I can’t explain.” The film-makers trace his flight from
  justice, using footage that Baker-Harber shot on her phone when they were on
  the run. She also takes them to an “odds-and-ends” shop on Vanuatu, where he
  was arrested in 2020: “His face just went white. They said: ‘Are you Inigo
  Philbrick?’ And he said: ‘Yes.’ And then suddenly more men came in with
  bulletproof vests on.” Both he and Baker-Harber, who have since married, blame
  his lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, for not securing a shorter sentence. Philbrick
  says: “I had walked into that room thinking that I was probably six months,
  nine months, 10 months to the door.” Baker-Harber says: “I got shafted, I
  feel. Inigo got shafted.” However, Lichtman says the few years he spent in
  prison for such a crime was in fact “a pretty tremendous result”, considering
  the strong case against him. When asked what the future holds for him,
  Philbrick says: “The ambition is to get back to doing what I was doing. I was
  a great art dealer.” The Great Art Fraud is on BBC Two on 27 and 28 August and
  on iPlayer.
