  A sex toy was tossed onto the court during a WNBA game for the second time
  this week. Video showed the sex toy out of bounds under a basket after a
  whistle was blown to stop play during the third quarter of the Golden State
  Valkyries’ 73-66 victory over the Chicago Sky. An official then kicked it
  aside before it was picked up and removed. “It’s super disrespectful,” Sky
  center Elizabeth Williams said in the postgame press conference. “I don’t
  really get the point of it. It’s really immature. Whoever is doing it needs to
  grow up.” A similar incident occurred Tuesday during the Valkyries’ 77-75
  victory over the Atlanta Dream in College Park, Georgia. “I mean, first of
  all, it was super dangerous,” Valkyries forward Cecilia Zandalasini said after
  Tuesday’s game. “And then when we found out what it was, I guess we just
  started laughing. I’ve never seen anything like that. I’m just glad we worked
  through that situation. We stayed locked in, we stayed concentrated.” New York
  Liberty forward Isabelle Harrison commented on social media about the
  situation Friday. “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??!” Harrison said on X. “Please do
  better. It’s not funny. Never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so
  dangerous.” Among the other players to address the safety risk was Indiana
  Fever guard Sophie Cunningham, who said: “stop throwing dildos on the court…
  you’re going to hurt one of us.”
