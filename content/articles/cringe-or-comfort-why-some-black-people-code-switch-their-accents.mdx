  There are times on The Long Wave desk when a conversation sparks a sort of
  group therapy session. A few weeks ago, Jason came back from a reporting trip
  to Barbados and made a comment about how some Bajans thought he was from the
  Caribbean, because his accent changed when he was there. This was fascinating
  to me. The ensuing discussion made me realise that all of us had shifted our
  accents at various times, which got me thinking about all the unconscious ways
  in which we “code switch”, alternating between different identities.
  Linguistic shapeshifting across the diaspora In the launch edition of The Long
  Wave, I wrote about how when I was growing up I consumed all my world news and
  cultural influences through the radio, and so my accent is a direct reflection
  of that. It is a little bit Voice of America, a little bit Christian Science
  Monitor and a whole lot of BBC. Add to that my British schooling in parts of
  Africa where there were still some stubborn colonial tendencies that focused
  on elocution and even inflection (never intone upwards when asking a question,
  we were taught, to maintain status in a conversation). The outcome has been a
  weirdly anachronistic British accent, one that was then undercut by
  consumption of American pop culture. The final result is a transatlantic
  mishmash. A lot of people I meet for the first time give up on trying to
  identify my accent and straight-up ask me where it’s from, a sort of frequency
  scrambling that underlines how important accents are in helping us place who
  we’re speaking to. What I never quite realised until our Long Wave chat is how
  much of that accent is not just an organic mixture of influences but a way of
  expression unconsciously adjusted in certain situations. *** You are what you
  speak An accent is an identifier, especially when you’re from an ethnic
  minority. And particularly in Britain, where accents fall along class lines,
  how one sounds can be a way to signal authority and credibility. There’s a
  phenomenon called “phone voice” in which we sound more “cut glass” and formal
  than we would in person, and that is because of its fundamentally remote
  nature. Phone voice accents become the load-bearing of our efforts to assert
  ourselves. It is, in effect, an attempt to ward off any bias or
  discrimination, to neutralise identity and its associated prejudices. Broadly,
  what became apparent during our conversation is that these are accents that
  choose us, rather than us choosing them. Different ways of speaking often
  present themselves involuntarily – clipped and sort of broadcast-y in work
  scenarios; softer and, in my case, more American among friends and loved ones
  yet downright Victorian when dealing with bureaucracies. I had come to think
  of my changing accent as related to the fact that English is not my first
  language, and so a clear and uniform accent had never fully bedded in – it was
  still malleable and easily influenced. But the truth is that it changes
  because there is a lurking sense of not quite belonging. *** Severing the
  mother tongue All sorts of things bear down on our accents, regardless of
  race. In England, the southern accent is considered the neutral and
  aspirational default, and research shows that when people with regional
  accents move to the south of the country and do not sand away their original
  speaking identity, they are sometimes subject to accent discrimination, which
  affects their professional and academic experiences due to a hierarchy of
  accent prestige. But race and immigrant extraction bring their own legacies to
  Black people’s expression. The Long Wave production editor, Janise Elie, said:
  “Many Caribbean people, including some family members, were forbidden from
  speaking or learning their ‘mother’ tongue and dialect in case it diluted
  their English accent. As a result, an important link to our roots and identity
  has been lost.” She is now teaching herself that mother tongue, Dominican
  Kwéyòl. I grew up speaking Arabic but English was privileged in our household,
  for reasons that were never explained. It was assumed that it was the key to
  unlocking aspirations in an English-dominated world, and I suppose perfecting
  it was a way to erase or dilute our identity, as if perfectly enunciated
  English would somehow disguise our Blackness. It’s a preposterous notion but
  draws on awareness of the risks of being too “other” and thus unfamiliar, and
  maybe even evoking suspicion. It reminds me of a sketch from the British TV
  show Little Miss Jocelyn (so good, too short-lived), where a Black character
  working in an office of white people panics when a new Black colleague joins
  the team, and furiously warns him not to be overly familiar, because no one
  knows she’s Black. *** Shame and acceptance What struck me about our accent
  conversation was that rush of familiarity; that sense of having something that
  had always been lurking in the back of your mind being given expression. There
  was something a bit giddy about the “Oh my God, same!” aspect of it. And I
  think that was because there was, perhaps, a little knot of shame or
  embarrassment about our changing accents; one that dissolved among the
  self-recognition, self-deprecation and universalism of our experiences. Our
  changing accents were simply a testament to how racialised minorities from all
  over the world instinctively pick up the same threads. We were all merely
  navigating gigantic social, class and racial forces that were beyond our
  control. And so, over the course of a spontaneous team conversation, something
  that was gnawingly cringe transformed into a warm, enveloping comfort. • To
