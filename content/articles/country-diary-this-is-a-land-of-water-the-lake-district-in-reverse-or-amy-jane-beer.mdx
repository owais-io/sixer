  Country diary: This is a land of water – the Lake District in reverse |

  By the third week in August, Swedish school terms have restarted and the
  thousands who make the Stockholm archipelago their summer home have returned
  to the city. Ferries have switched to winter timetables and people are
  outnumbered by fallow deer. I try to get my bearings using the chart hanging
  in my cousin’s summerhouse, but the white-tailed eagle view of 30,000 islands,
  islets and skerries is baffling. A boat is essential, and my son makes the
  necessary perspective shift before I do. “It’s like the Lake District in
  reverse,” he says. “The land is water and the lakes are islands.” I see what
  he means. There is something about the ice-worn geology and the vegetation
  dominated by pines, alder and birch that feels familiar, but the scale and
  intricate wateriness of the place is as confusing as it is beguiling. I find
  that the Baltic is forcing me to reset my idea of “sea”. There are no big
  waves, just a crosshatching of wind ruffles and wakes. The water is mildly
  brackish at most, and almost completely non-tidal, small day-to-day level
  changes driven more by variable air pressure than lunar gravity. But the
  apparent stability is an illusion. The whole basin was a lake until the North
  Sea broke through after the last ice age, and change is still ongoing, with
  post-glacial isostatic adjustment outpacing sea level rise here by a
  millimetre or two a year – that means the islands are growing, for now at
  least. There is a sort of ambivalence here, as though this place has not fully
  made up its mind to be land or water, lake or sea, sweet or salt. It is
  neither and both, it is icke-binär – non-binary. At the house of my cousin’s
  friends, between crayfish, schnapps and traditional drinking songs, we learn
  that the area is about to become Sweden’s 31st national park. It’s somewhat
  controversial – planning restrictions and a higher tourist profile won’t suit
  everyone. But with climate warming and nutrient enrichment with agricultural
  fertilisers bringing worsening algal blooms, there are other challenges here
  that require concerted action and might just benefit from such a protective
  designation. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country
