  Labour is preparing to kick off a new wave of public-private partnerships
  (PPPs) in England to build the neighbourhood health centres at the heart of
  its NHS 10-year plan. Ministers will make a final decision in the autumn
  budget about whether to use the funding approach, which was put on pause eight
  years ago. But critics say lessons have not been learned about the pitfalls of
  PPPs, and point to the chaos unleashed by the 2018 collapse of the
  mega-contractor Carillion, with its complex portfolio of projects. While it
  was originally conceived under the Conservatives, Tony Blair’s Labour
  government made significant use of the private finance initiative (PFI), a
  form of PPP used to build schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure,
  without adding to the national debt. Backers of PFI say this approach allowed
  public infrastructure to be built that otherwise would not exist; but
  opponents say the taxpayer was often left footing huge bills for inflexible
  contracts that ran for as long as 30 years. Treasury data shows that 560 PFI
  contracts are outstanding in England, for projects including schools,
  hospitals, libraries and road maintenance. Hundreds of these contracts will
  end in the coming years, raising questions about the state of the assets being
  inherited by the taxpayer, and potentially triggering legal battles about the
  precise conditions of “handback”. A report last year from the Association of
  Infrastructure Investors in Public Private Partnerships (AIIP), chaired by the
  Labour peer and former frontbencher John Hutton, warned of the risk of
  “serious disruption” as these deals come to an end, amid what it called
  “mistrust between the parties to some PFI contracts”. Rachel Reeves will be
  under no illusion about the pitfalls of PPP, having chaired the House of
  Commons business select committee when MPs examined the fate of Carillion,
  which was enmeshed in a number of PFI deals as well as being a direct
  contractor to government. However, the government is under pressure to
  transform the UK’s crumbling public services, with limited resources, and
  recent announcements have made clear that ministers are ready to dip their toe
  into this controversial area. The 10-year infrastructure strategy, published
  in June, said the government would “explore the feasibility of using new PPP
  models for taxpayer-funded projects (for example in decarbonising the public
  sector estate and in certain types of primary care and community health
  infrastructure) in very limited circumstances where they could represent value
  for money”. Scotland and Wales have developed their own, alternative
  approaches to public private partnerships, called “non-profit distributing”
  partnerships and the “mutual investment model” respectively. Darren Jones,
  chief secretary to the Treasury, says reviving PPP in England could “allow us
  to do more, quicker, than you would otherwise be able to do”. He is clear that
  that includes neighbourhood health centres, which are meant to transform NHS
  care by shifting more treatment out of hospitals. The NHS 10-year plan made a
  commitment to “develop a business case for the use of public private
  partnerships for neighbourhood health centres, ahead of a final decision at
  the autumn budget”. Jones said: “We’ve got the new hospital programme building
  stuff, which is obviously huge. We’ve got the maintenance backlog, which is
  huge. We’ve chosen to invest a lot in technology to improve productivity and
  diagnostics and all that type of stuff. And you don’t have an infinite budget.
  So if there’s an innovative way of delivering a key objective for us, that’s
  what we’re trying to make happen.” Nevertheless, there is some anxiety inside
  and outside government about the risks attached to potential contracts, even
  if they are much more narrowly conceived than the mega-projects of the Blair
  years. When the NHS 10-year plan was launched, Unison’s general secretary,
  Christina McAnea, warned: “Basing any funding on a failed market system and
  expensive private finance model would be a major error, especially with money
  so tight.” The legacy of previous waves of public private partnership is
  complex. Research this year, by the economist Max Mosley, then at the National
  Institute of Economic and Social Research, looked at 1,000 schools built
  through PFI. It found that £13.5bn was being spent at local level on
  repayments, 31% of which was going on interest. Mosley, now at the New
  Economics Foundation, said: “When PFI projects failed it carried devastating
  consequences, from huge costs levied on hospitals, to state-of-the-art schools
  having to close down. “Clarity is crucial. We need to understand what types of
  services are in scope, how risk will be managed, and how the mistakes of the
  past will be avoided.” Backers of PPPs argue that the assets being handed back
  to the public sector when decades-long contracts come to an end are in better
  condition than crumbling public buildings whose upkeep has been left to the
  taxpayer. A recent National Audit Office report on the use of PPPs to fund
  public infrastructure called for a series of changes, including better sharing
  of risk between taxpayers and investors. “Departments should assess risks,
  determine who is best placed to bear them, and design agreements that clearly
  establish the corresponding risk allocation,” said one recommendation. Hutton,
  of the AIIP, said that “despite the myths”, PFI had delivered “hundreds of
  schools, hospitals and health centres that would have never otherwise been
  built, with ringfenced maintenance”. He added: “PPPs operate in every other
  western economy. By applying the lessons learned and harnessing technology to
  reduce complexity and avoid disputes, PPP can rebuild our vital public
  services with buildings that will stand for decades to come.” Labour has set
  up a new body, the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation
  Authority, to be the government’s centre of expertise on these issues, though
  sceptics argue that it is more of a rebranding exercise than a significant
  beefing-up of resource. Iain Murray, the director of public financial
  management at Cipfa, the professional body for public sector finance experts,
  said it was understandable that PPP was back on the table but that its success
  would depend on learning the lessons from earlier generations of projects. “A
  lot of these deals were modelled in [a] low-inflation, low-interest-rate
  environment and all of a sudden the world turns on its head – and that’s not
  just about the money, it’s about the services they’re providing to the
  public,” he said. “How do you build that flexibility in? Is there a way you
  can think about structuring those deals to get the kinds of outcomes you
  want?”
