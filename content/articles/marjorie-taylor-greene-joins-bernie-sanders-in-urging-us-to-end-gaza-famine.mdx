  Amid mostly silence in Congress, some US lawmakers on opposite sides of the
  political spectrum spoke out Saturday over a UN-backed report warning of
  famine in parts of Gaza. “Let’s be clear: President Trump has the power to end
  the starvation of the Palestinian people,” Vermont’s politically independent
  senator Bernie Sanders posted on X. “Instead he is doing nothing while
  watching this famine unfold. Enough is enough. No more American taxpayer
  dollars to Nethanyahu’s [sic] war machine.” Sanders, who also pushed
  resolutions to ban selling US weapons to Israel, has long been consistent
  about his concern regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid the war.
  Marjorie Taylor Greene, the outspoken, far-right Georgia Republican, also
  called for greater compassion for Palestinians in a social media post
  Saturday, a day after UN secretary general António Gutteres described the
  famine in the territory as a “failure of humanity”. The US representative, in
  a departure from the majority of her peers in Congress, described the Gaza
  humanitarian crisis as a genocide last month. In a long post on X, she then
  said that while Israel’s war against Hamas was justified, the suffering of
  civilians was not. “Does Hamas deserve it? Yes,” Greene wrote, in part. “Do
  innocent people and children deserve it? No.” “The innocent people in Gaza did
  not kill and kidnap the innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th,” she continued.
  “Just as we spoke out and had compassion for the victims and families of Oct7,
  how can Americans not speak out and have compassion for the masses of innocent
  people and children in Gaza?” Greene linked the entirety of US financial and
  military aid to Israel to the conflict, arguing that it “means every U.S. tax
  payer is contributing to Israel’s military actions”. “I don’t know about you,
  but I don’t want to pay for genocide in a foreign country against a foreign
  people for a foreign war that I had nothing to do with,” Greene concluded.
  “And I will not be silent about it.” The post received an almost immediate
  response from far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who reportedly petitioned the
  White House to suspend the entry of injured Palestinian children from Gaza to
  the US. Greene and Loomer, both claiming the mantle of Maga authenticity, have
  bitterly clashed on the issue, with Loomer falsely describing Palestinian
  children as a “national security threat” and “Islamic invaders”. Loomer, who
  is Jewish, once claimed that her ban from social media platforms for
  anti-Muslim hate speech was antisemitic, while Greene infamously shared an
  antisemitic conspiracy theory that wildfires in California might have been
  started by Jewish space lasers. On Saturday, Loomer hit out at Greene, falsely
  accusing her of calling for Palestinians from Gaza to be resettled in the US
  and asking: “Why are you advocating for GAZANS to come to the US? How is
  Islamic immigration ‘America First’?” The UN-backed Integrated Food Security
  Phase Classification (IPC) said last week that parts of Gaza are experiencing
  a “man-made” famine in the Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City, site of
  a new Israeli offensive. “As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be
  halted and reversed,” the report said. “The time for debate and hesitation has
  passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no
  doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed.” The
  Israeli agency heading aid distribution in Gaza, the Coordination of
  Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), rejected the report, saying
  it “relies on partial, biased data and superficial information originating
  from Hamas”. On Saturday, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, said on
  X that “the [international] media is missing the real story of ‘famine’ in
  Gaza. Hostages ARE starving, Hamas is getting fat, &amp; the UN declares
  famine while 92% of THEIR food is stolen to be sold by Hamas. Meanwhile UN
  food sits rotting in sun. The UN should declare itself corrupt &amp;
  incompetent.” In her post, Greene wrote that if the US were being bombed day
  and night, with millions killed or injured, and the world said “Americans
  voted for their government so they deserve it… How would you feel? What would
  you think? What would you do?”
