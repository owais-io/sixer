  Aween Bin Terawin submerges himself in the mangrove swamp to reach a crab cage
  on the riverbed below. After a moment of suspense, he lifts the cage above the
  water’s surface and inspects its interior. Empty. After stowing the
  collapsible cage away in his boat, he continues his journey through the vast
  swamp to retrieve the 40 cages he set early that morning, each marked by a
  floating bottle tied to string. Bin Terawin is a member of the Orang Seletar
  community, one of Malaysia’s Indigenous sea communities who live along the
  coast of Johor, Malaysia’s southernmost state. While some Orang Laut groups
  (meaning “sea people”) such as the Orang Seletar remain in coastal villages in
  Johor, others have settled and assimilated into communities in Singapore. The
  next four cages Bin Terawin retrieves are also empty, until he brings up one
  hosting a small crab. “Too young,” he says. Orang Seletar fishers have an
  agreement to throw juvenile catch back to help maintain populations. For all
  their efforts of sustainable fishing, the main sources of livelihood for these
  people are dwindling, mostly due to property development on the shores where
  they fish and changing waters as the climate heats. Today, Bin Terawin hauls
  just two crabs, hardly enough to cover his boat’s petrol costs for the day. To
  make space for development, the shorelines of Malaysia and Singapore have been
  expanding through land reclamation, whereby large quantities of sand are
  dumped into the sea. “The land reclamation means there are fewer mangroves,
  and the fish have nowhere to go,” says Tok Batin Salim Palon, leader of Sungai
  Temon, one of eight Orang Seletar villages in Johor Bahru with a combined
  population of about 2,000. Sungai Temon has been particularly badly affected
  by property development plans. Despite advocating for their ancestral rights
  through a protracted legal battle which lasted more than a decade, the
  villagers have been told they will be relocated in the coming years. Orang
  Seletar fishers say such development also affects their ability to fish, as
  sand dredging stirs up huge clouds of silt. “The sea has become shallow
  instead of becoming deeper,” says Bin Terawin. “Our water has become polluted,
  like coffee water. “If we see the water is dirty, we don’t go to sea. There’s
  no use.” While development has degraded fish habitats, other fishers note that
  storms have intensified. With the loss of mangroves to act as a natural
  buffer, these storms can be dangerous. “Sometimes we have to cut the net and
  rush back to land,” says John Aine, a fisher in nearby Simpang Arang village.
  This has an economic cost, as nets are expensive to replace. Despite these
  hardships, seafaring communities and their descendants are pushing back
  against this threat to their way of life. In Singapore, where most Orang Laut
  groups have now assimilated into urban communities, their descendants are
  reclaiming their heritage through cultural events and education. Firdaus
  Sani’s ancestors lived on Pulau Semakau until 1977 when they were relocated to
  mainland Singapore. He is a key figure behind “Hari Orang Pulau”, a day of
  dance, cultural workshops and panel discussions. “Our Islanders’ Day is not
  only a celebration, it’s advocacy,” he says. “It’s a way to say that we are
  still here, we are not left in the past. That we don’t intend to let our
  communities’ culture and heritage die off.” Sani’s aim is to preserve the
  cultural heritage of his community in Singapore, and support other coastal
  people in south-east Asia that are at risk of losing theirs. In Johor,
  communities who still depend on fishing are adapting to their new reality.
  Aween’s father, Bowen Bin Terawin, now has a small fish farm which he says
  yields more catch than traditional fishing methods, and allows him to continue
  living from the sea. For Tok Batin, whose community is facing relocation,
  mainstream education is becoming a vital way to prepare young people for a
  future where fishing may no longer be viable. “The young people here might not
  become fishermen, so it’s good that they are prepared,” he says. For Bin
  Terawin, the changes felt by the Orang Seletar are already clear to see, and
  he thinks more change is on the horizon. “Before, Seletar people lived in
  sampans [wooden boats] but now we live on land,” he says “Now the Orang
  Seletar can read and we wear modern clothes. “If we want to adapt for the
  future,” he adds. “We need to change.”
