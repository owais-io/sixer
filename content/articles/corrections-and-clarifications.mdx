  executive, as John “Fitzpatrick” (UK’s first transgender judge challenges
  supreme court ruling on biological sex, 18 August, p5). • An interview with

  Palestine Action ban protest explain their decision ‘We’re anti-federal
  chaos’: Democratic cities prepare for worst after Trump’s tirades against DC
