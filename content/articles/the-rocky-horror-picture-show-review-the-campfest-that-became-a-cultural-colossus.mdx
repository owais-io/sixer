  The Rocky Horror Picture Show review – the campfest that became a cultural
  colossus

  The Rocky Horror Picture Show is now 50 years old, a B-picture
  horror-schlocker campfest extravaganza based on Richard O’Brien’s original
  stage musical from 1973; it has carried on as an international theatrical
  touring phenomenon ever since. That live show, with the vital element of
  regular audience participation and dress-up, may in fact now have a bit more
  energy and point than the movie itself, which (whisper it) perhaps suffers a
  few longueurs. The undoubted star is the sonorous and feline Tim Curry playing
  Dr Frank-N-Furter, a vampirically queer alien sex god, proselytising here on
  Earth for borderless pleasure and describing himself as a “sweet transvestite
  transsexual from Transylvania”. Dr Furter toys with the affections of the many
  followers and servants at his giant castle in middle America, including his
  butler Riff-Raff (played by O’Brien) and tearaway Eddie (played by Meat Loaf).
  Dr Furter is actually focused on his Frankensteinian project of creating Rocky
  Horror (Peter Hinwood), the ideal hunky blond male to service his needs. Even
  Dr Frankenstein didn’t actually want to have sex with his monster. One stormy
  night, while Dr Furter is presiding over another of his regular hideous
  debauches at the castle, a wholesome young all-American couple, saving
  themselves for marriage, turn up rain-drenched, and ask for help because their
  car has broken down – in which they had actually been listening, sadly and
  sympathetically, to Richard Nixon’s resignation address on the car radio. They
  are Brad, played by Barry Bostwick, and Janet, played by Susan Sarandon; her
  white bra and slip ensemble is incidentally the sexiest thing in the whole
  film. Dr Furter relieves both of them of their virginity, individually, and
  Brad and Janet finally get turned on to sensual pleasure, with the film
  reaching an orgasmic climax of eyeliner-and-fishnet-stocking-wearing musical
  theatre naughtiness. It is a genuine one-off, a movie whose own identity has
  now overshadowed its ostensible purpose: to spoof the classic movie chillers
  of yesteryear. There are pious invocations of Fay Wray in King Kong and Claude
  Rains in The Invisible Man, although Rocky Horror itself has long since become
  a spoofable mainstay and in any case cinephilia isn’t the point; the point is
  sex, the pervier and freakier the better. Don’t dream it, be it, says The
  Rocky Horror Picture Show, with all the fervency that Hair once sang about the
  dawning of the age of Aquarius. It seems a little quaint, but there’s still a
  high raunch factor. • The Rocky Horror Picture Show is in UK cinemas from 22
  August.
