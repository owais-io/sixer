  President Trump imposed a military takeover of the nation’s capital on Monday,
  sending National Guard troops to Washington. He also seized control of the DC
  municipal police department, invoking an obscure section of the 1973 D.C. Home
  Rule Act which allows the president to take control of local law enforcement
  in the district for a period of one month in times of emergency. That there is
  no emergency is irrelevant: Trump has declared one in order to exercise powers
  that are only available to him in a state of exception, which is, of course,
  what the whole country increasingly finds itself to be experiencing as the
  president expands the powers of his office from those of a constitutional
  executive into something more like the power of authoritarian control. The
  move follows the Trump administration’s deployment of both the National Guard
  and the Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year; in a press conference
  announcing the move on Monday, Trump suggested that he also intends to deploy
  the military to cities such as Baltimore, Oakland and New York. “This will go
  further,” he said. “We’re starting very strongly with DC” The deployment
  reflects Trump’s continued determination to further erode the longstanding
  American taboo against deploying military personnel for domestic law
  enforcement. It hardly matters what the pretext for such moves are. In LA,
  Trump claimed that protests against his administration’s kidnapping of
  immigrants was causing unsustainable disorder in the city; it wasn’t. In DC,
  Trump is likewise claiming that crime is out of control; it is not. (Crime has
  in fact dropped precipitously in Washington over the past decade, with violent
  crimes declining by more than half since 2013; there has been an especially
  steep decline in the crime rate since 2023.) In a bit of dark comedy, attorney
  general Pam Bondi appeared at the press conference and stood at a podium to
  declare that crime in DC would soon come to an end, all while flanked by
  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump, two men accused – and, in
  Trump’s case, convicted – of numerous crimes themselves. But no one is really
  supposed to believe that the deployment of troops to America’s most liberal,
  most racially diverse, and most culturally thriving cities is an actual
  response to an actual crisis. Rather, the thinness of the pretext is itself a
  demonstration of power. The Trump administration, and national Republicans
  more broadly, have increasingly been willing to argue that Democratic rule is
  illegitimate even where Democratic politicians are duly elected; the
  nationalization of law enforcement in DC follows from this premise, seizing
  authority that rightly belongs to the Democratic local officials and
  distributing it to the Republican national figures who will brook no
  disagreement and tolerate no imposition of policies with which they disagree.
  Such a move may not, in the end, lead to widespread violence: aside from the
  lack of much actual crime for them to respond to, the capital is unbearably
  hot in the summertime, and one imagines sleepy-looking National Guard troops
  wandering aimlessly around the National Mall in the August swamp heat, wilted
  and sweaty in their tactical gear. But the imposition should, in a country
  with sufficient civic virtue, spawn mass protests all the same. The troops,
  after all, are not there to solve a real problem; there is no actual crisis
  for Trump to exploit. They are there, instead, because the president wants to
  send a message: that cities and states that are not sufficiently deferential
  to him in law will have his will imposed on them by force. The result is the
  same politics of shakedown and threat that Trump has wielded so successfully
  against universities and major businesses: he will impose suffering on anyone
  who does not defer to his will. One strange facet of the Trump era is the
  continually receding horizon of terms like “dictatorship” and
  “authoritarianism.” Is it an “authoritarian” move for Trump to seize control
  of the DC police force if a statute technically grants him the legal authority
  to do so? Is it a “dictatorship” if the mechanisms used to extend presidential
  control into things like private university admissions policies partakes of
  the nominal consent of administrators? Is it really a collapsed democracy if
  the soldiers marching down the streets of the capitol haven’t actually wound
  up shooting anyone yet? These are the kinds of questions that sound ridiculous
  and naïve when you say them out loud; they sound like the kind of
  excuse-making one engages in when the effort to maintain denial has become
  desperate. They are also, often, debates involving the sort of semantic
  questions that are a bad sign when they come up at all: if the answer was
  good, no one would be asking the question. But the militarization of DC also
  illustrates a core feature of fascist regimes, which is their collapse of
  rhetoric and reality. Symbolism, language, images: these are core to Trump’s
  political project, which is as much mythic as it is material. Trump’s claims
  about crime and disorder are plain lies. But the ability to make your lies
  have the force of fact is a terrifying power. No one can doubt that Trump has
  seized it. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist
