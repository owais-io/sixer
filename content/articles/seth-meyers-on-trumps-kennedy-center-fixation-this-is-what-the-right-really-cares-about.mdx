  With most late-night hosts on holiday, Seth Meyers looked into Donald Trump’s
  fixation with the Kennedy Center after he said he picked honorees to prevent
  “woke” winners. Seth Meyers “You might be wondering why you haven’t heard much
  about important issues like inflation, healthcare or infrastructure lately,”
  said Seth Meyers on Thursday’s Late Night, “but there’s a very good reason:
  Donald Trump doesn’t care. He pretended to care during the campaign, the same
  way you pretend to love apple picking when you’re dating someone. “Trump and
  Maga don’t actually care if people can afford healthcare or groceries,” he
  continued. But they do care about the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing
  Arts, which Trump took over early in his term, firing the board and installing
  himself as chair. Earlier this week, Trump announced plans to personally host
  its annual award show, the Kennedy Center Honors, in December. Trump also said
  he was about “98% involved” in selecting the honorees. “I turned down plenty,”
  he said. “I had a couple of wokesters.” “I’m sorry, did he say ‘wokesters’?”
  said Meyers. “A wokester sounds like a car your great-grandfather drove after
  the war. “Shout out to the free speech warriors going radio silent while the
  president just fully admits he’s punishing artists for their politics,” he
  added. “You keep doing you, but only when it fits your worldview, you fucking
  hypocrites. “But Trump says these things with impunity, because this is what
  really animates the Maga movement,” he continued. “They don’t care about
  policy or improving people’s lives. They want to go on Fox News and whine
  about woke.” Meyers played a series clips of numerous Republicans fuming about
  so-called cancellations of characters from Mr Potato Head to Pepe Le Pew. “You
  can’t freak out every time a few people online complain about something,” said
  Meyers. “That doesn’t represent the left. That’s just social media. The same
  thing happened with the Sydney Sweeney jeans ad: no one in a real position of
  power on the left or in the Democratic party said a word about it, but then
  the most annoying voices on the right spent weeks fanning a so-called backlash
  to the backlash to mine clicks, until it got all the way to the president, who
  felt the need to talk about it in between flag humps. “This is what the right
  really cares about. This is why Trump is spending his precious time announcing
  the Kennedy Center Honors and complaining about how he never personally was
  offered that award.” As Trump put it: “I would’ve taken it, if they called me
  … I waited and waited and waited.” “You were waiting by the phone for a
  Kennedy Center award? What did you think you were going to get it for?” Meyers
  laughed. “I mean, I know he thought he should’ve won an Emmy for The
  Apprentice, but the Kennedy Center honor is for performing artists who have
  contributed a lifetime to the culture. Did you put out an album that we don’t
  know about? Were you in a band called Trumpawampa? You haven’t done anything
  for the arts, and you still sat by the phone thinking ‘I think this might be
  my year?’ “But this is what they want,” he concluded. “They complain about
  participation trophies, and then demand trophies for not even participating in
  anything.”
