  Authorities in Japan and South Korea have urged people to take precautions to
  prevent heatstroke, as the region reels from record-breaking temperatures and
  pressure on hospitals. On Thursday, South Korea’s meteorological office said
  the country had experienced a record-breaking streak of “tropical nights” for
  22 consecutive days this month. A day earlier, Japan saw its hottest day on
  record, with the mercury reaching 41.2C, as hospitals across the country were
  inundated with people who had fallen ill as a result of the heatwave.
  Overnight temperatures in Seoul stayed above 25C for 22 consecutive days in
  July, meteorological officials said – the longest period since modern weather
  records were first kept in 1907. The South Korean capital was also due to
  record its hottest July night in history on Wednesday, with the lowest
  temperature of the day at 29.3C. Media reports said the record could be broken
  again on Thursday. The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue,
  according to the meteorology office. “The warm air from the North Pacific High
  began affecting South Korea a bit earlier than usual,” Youn Ki-han, director
  of Seoul’s meteorology forecast division, told Agence France-Presse. Youn
  added: “Normally, if it’s hot for just a day, temperatures spike and then
  quickly return to normal. But when warm conditions persist for several days,
  the heat doesn’t fully dissipate, it lingers and accumulates with each day.”
  Japanese weather officials said the temperature on Wednesday had risen to
  41.2C in Tamba, in the western prefecture of Hyogo, and urged people to stay
  hydrated and use air conditioners and electric fans to prevent heat-related
  illnesses. Japan’s temperature record was broken as a high-pressure system
  brought clear skies and blistering heat to many parts of the country, the
  meteorological agency said, adding that the brutal weather was expected to
  continue into Thursday. The agency said temperatures on Wednesday had exceeded
  35C at 271 of its 914 observation points, with new highs seen in 39 places.
  The previous record of 41.1C was set in Hamamatsu in Shizuoka prefecture, in
  August 2020, and in Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture near Tokyo in July 2018. The
  extreme heat poses a particular threat to the countries’ large populations of
  older people. Thirteen people have died in South Korea from suspected
  heat-related causes so far this year – three times the number over the same
  period last year – according to the Korea’s disease control and prevention
  agency. In Japan, 10,804 people, more than half of whom were aged over 64,
  were taken to hospital suffering from exhaustion and other heat-related
  illnesses in the week up to 21 July – the highest weekly number so far this
  year. Sixteen people died, according to the fire and disaster management
  agency. Summer temperatures in Japan have soared in recent years as a result
  of more erratic weather patterns that scientists attribute to the climate
  crisis. Last summer was Japan’s joint hottest on record, with temperatures
  matching those of 2023, which was followed by the warmest autumn since records
  began 126 years ago. The heat is also affecting overseas visitors. On
  Wednesday, the temperature reached 40C for the first time on record in Kyoto,
  which last year attracted a record 10.88 million foreign tourists.
  Human-caused climate breakdown is supercharging extreme weather across the
  world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters from heatwaves to
  floods to wildfires. Agence France-Presse contributed reporting.
