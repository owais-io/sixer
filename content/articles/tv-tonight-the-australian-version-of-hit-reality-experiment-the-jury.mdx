  The Jury Australia: Death on the Staircase 10pm, Channel 4 “I am a massive
  Judge Judy fan to be completely honest.” That’s Michael, one of the 12 people
  taking part in this Australian version of the hit jury simulation show. Others
  include a former prison guard who never questioned inmates’ guilt and a member
  of Mensa. They watch actors stage a real manslaughter case – word-for-word
  from transcripts – and must deliver their own verdict at the end. Hollie
  Richardson Our Lives: The Film I’ll Never See 7.30pm, BBC One Dave Steele is a
  spoken-word artist with retinitis pigmentosa who is also known as the Blind
  Poet. This short film follows him as he explores the impact his condition has
  on his family, capturing his resilient spirit. HR Mahler’s Fifth at the Proms
  8pm, BBC Four “Nobody understood it,” lamented Gustav of his glorious Fifth
  Symphony. “I wish I could conduct the first performance 50 years after my
  death.” In lieu of that, here’s Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä rising to the
  challenge. It goes without saying that the Adagietto is one of the most
  astonishing 10 minutes in musical history. Ali Catterall Here We Go 9pm, BBC
  One The third series of this comedy about the Jessop family rolls on with a
  holiday to Malta – and tension ensues. Amy wants to go out on the town, Robin
  wants to scuba dive, Cherry wants to chill, Paul wants to deep dive into
  history and Rachel fancies that classic holiday activity: wading into
  long-standing grievances. Alexi Duggins Miriam Margolyes Discovers New Zealand
  9pm, BBC Two It’s the second and concluding part of the eccentric actor’s tour
  of the country– and of course she meets up with an organised crime gang
  member. She ends with a trip to the South Island, where she connects with a
  landscape that conjures every emotion. HR Peacemaker 10pm, Sky Max Things are
  not going great for would-be superhero Peacemaker (John Cena): his recent
  cocaine-fuelled orgy has left him with lots to clean up, including a dead
  body. To make things worse, shady government outfit Argus has assigned an
  eccentric agent named Langston Fleury (Tim Meadows) to surveil him. Graeme
  Virtue Film Choice The Driller Killer, 10.10pm, Talking Pictures TV Unfairly
  drawn into the “video nasties” furore of the early 1980s, Abel Ferrara’s
  low-budget thriller is actually relatively restrained in its blood-letting.
  Troubled painter Reno (Ferrara himself) only starts losing his grip on reality
  – taking up his battery-operated drill to attack homeless men – late on in a
  drama more interested in the hard-scrabble life of the marginalised and the
  mentally ill in a crime-ridden New York. From the down-and-outs on the streets
  to the punk band rehearsing next door, it’s a time capsule of the late-70s
  city. Simon Wardell
