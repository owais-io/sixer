  Wins for Glamorgan at the top end of Division Two, and Yorkshire at the bottom
  end of Division One, spruces things up nicely as the County Championship slips
  into the wings for August. Glamorgan’s first Championship victory at Old
  Trafford since 1993 left them sitting pretty in the second promotion spot
  behind Leicestershire. Rain had wiped out most of the morning’s cricket but
  the visiting bowlers stuck to their task against Lancashire, Asitha Fernando
  producing a juicy inswinging yorker to get rid of Tom Bailey and Ben Kellaway
  persuading Chris Green, the saviour of Cheltenham, to top-edge a sweep.
  Glamorgan cemented their victory when Jimmy Anderson was bowled by Mason Crane
  – who hopped on the team coach with nine for 126 in the match. A Scarborough,
  a 22-point hoopla lifted Yorkshire clear of the immediate relegation zone.
  After Sussex lost three wickets in the first 20 minutes, Fynn Hudson-Prentice
  (52 not out) and Jack Carson dropped anchor for 34 overs, until Carson was
  caught by a grasshopper-legged Adam Lyth off Dom Bess. Matt Milnes polished
  off the rest to finish with five for 31. Every other game finished as a draw,
  some with jeopardy – like at New Road, where a second century of the match
  from Jake Libby wasn’t quite enough to help Division One bottom side
  Worcestershire over the line in their run chase against Hampshire. There were
  a few early nerves at Trent Bridge too, until a steadfast partnership between
  Toms Abell and Banton steadied the good ship Somerset against Nottinghamshire.
  Elsewhere, rain and sparky sixties from Brooke Guest and Luis Reece saved
  Derbyshire against Northamptonshire at Wantage Road, while Leicestershire’s
  Ben Compton celebrated a career-best 221 at Kent. Joe Phillips’ maiden
  first-class hundred enlivened the final day between Gloucestershire and
  Middlesex, and there was just time for Warwickshire’s Ed Barnard to bag a
  century and Essex captain Tom Westley 50 before the Chelmsford rain arrived. A
  slow-burn, early-August last afternoon thriller at New Road to finish thing
  off. Thanks for your company as always. We’ll be back on September 8, have a
  wonderful summer! DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT
  Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6 dec and 96-1 DRAW
  with Warwickshire 485 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 544 DRAW with Somerset 438

  Trafford: Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec BEAT Lancashire 137 and 318 by 154 runs.

  129 6 Sussex 127 7 Yorkshire 126 7 Essex 126 9 Durham 114 10 Worcestershire 89
  Close, so close, but no cigar. New Road: Worcestershire 249 and 303-8 DRAW
  with Hampshire 293 and 313-7dec Hang on – Tom Taylor is suddenly walking back
  to the pavilion after Sonny Baker removes his middle stump . Seven balls left,
  Hampshire need two wickets. Eighteen deliveries left at New Road, quarter to
  seven, the cathedral looks impassively on. Three wickets left. 1
  Leicestershire 193 2 Glamorgan 165 3 Derbyshire 141 4 Middlesex 138 5
  Gloucestershire 131 6 Lancashire 127 7 Northants 123 8 Kent 97 The
  Worcestershire run-chase has petered out, and with 30 balls left, three
  wickets left, Kyle Abbott comes back for once last blast A rain-ruined game
  drifts to an end, as Gloucestershire collect their fourth batting point,
  alongside maximum bowling points for Middlesex. Cheltenham: Gloucestershire
  404-9 DRAW with Middlesex 445 Gloucestershire 15 points, Middlesex 15. Baker
  gets the big one, Dolly done by inswing – 286 for seven. 72 needed, three
  wickets and 35 balls left. A boundary from Baker’s last ball leaves
  Worcestershire an unlikely but not yet buried 82 to win from seven overs.
  Sonny Baker gets the call and I’ve never seen his idiosyncratic stop-start
  run-up before. Straight out of the coaching manual back garden. Taylor unable,
  as yet, to go big. And, damn it, Waite is caught at long on. …where
  Worcestershire are batting as if their Division One position depends on it…
  ah, it does. A second fabulous century by Libby, 65 from Kashif Ali, and
  cameos from the rest. Worcestershire, 261-5 need 97 to win from nine overs –
  D’Oliveira and Waite the men with the job. Gloucestershire and Middlesex are
  enjoying actually playing cricket and picking up first-innings bowling/batting
  points but the real action is at New Road… Northants thwarted by Luis Reece
  (61), Brooke Guest (60) and the rain. Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v
  Derbyshire 377 and 184-5 Northamptonshire 13 points, Derbyshire 13 points.
  Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 544 DRAW with Somerset 438 and 200-5
  Nottinghamshire 13 points, Somerset 12 Canterbury: Kent 445-8 DRAW with
  Leicestershire 471 Leicestershire 14 points, Kent 13 points Hmmm, Somerset
  actually have lost a wicket, the not-so=steadfast=after-all Tom Abell. But I’m
  going to have to leave things there as I write up for Friday deadlines. Back
  in a bit. A miserable prognosis for poor Chris Woakes. Tom Abell has the sort
  of steadfast fifty that is very pleasing to Anthony Gibson, Tom Banton is 31
  not out. This partnership, over 35 overs, has realistically put the game to
  sleep. A flash of inspiration at soggy Cheltenham – which is officially young
  Joe Phillips’ happy place. He pocketed 56 and 64 against Lancs last week, and
  now a unbeaten hundred against Middlesex. Ben Kellaway chews the fat after
  Glamorgan’s first win at OT for 32 years. “It was an interesting pitch - it
  spun from day one which you don’t see that often so credit to our openers as I
  think our opening stand was the reason we got into a winning position. “It
  flattened out towards the end and day three and four was easier to bat on but
  I think we still bowled really nicely and came out of it with the win. “I am
  enjoying my role and the battles I’m getting into and I’m getting some nice
  rewards and bowling in tandem with Mason (Crane), who bowled brilliantly in
  this game, has been really nice.” It smells like four draws and a Northants
  win. Let’s see what the next two hours hold. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street:
  Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. Chelmsford:
  Essex 602-6 dec and 96-1 DRAW with Warwickshire 485 Trent Bridge:
  Nottinghamshire 544 v Somerset 438 and 168-4 New Road: Worcestershire 249 and
  61-1 v Hampshire 293 and 313-7dec Worcs need 297 to win Scarborough: Yorkshire
  545-9dec BEAT Sussex 222 and 195 by an innings and 128 runs DIVISION TWO
  Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 209-2 v Middlesex 445 Canterbury: Kent 429-8 v
  Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec BEAT Lancashire
  137 and 318 by 154 runs. Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v Derbyshire 377
  and 74-5 So, as tea approaches, five games are still going. Two certain draws
  at Cheltenham and Canterbury. An afternoon for the bowlers at soggy Wantage
  Road, where Northants need six quick Derbyshire wickets for the win.
  Worcestershire need 309 for an unlikely win at New Road, or have a session to
  survive; while at Trent Bridge, Abell and Banton have steadied the Somerset
  ship. Their lead 54 – with six wickets up their sleeve. They’ve called it a
  day amongst the puddles at Chelmsford. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6 dec and 96-1
  DRAW with Warwickshire 485 Essex 14 points, Warwickshire 12. When you turn
  your head for a minute…two wickets fall in two runs and Yorkshire wrap this up
  before tea. Scarborough: Yorkshire 545-9dec BEAT Sussex 222 and 195 by an
  innings and 128 runs A vital win for Yorkshire, who – I think – leap both
  Durham and Essex. Sussex’s mid-table position is less perky than it was. And a
  breakthrough at Scarborough! The video shows Adam Lyth have a good scratch at
  slip before a scampering dive to collect an edge off Carson, the bowler, Bess.
  The commentators note an irate Carson marching back to the pavilion. Yorkshire
  need two for victory. Much like yesterday’s brain fade at Scarborough, Gareth
  Roderick has a sudden desire to run a quick single, and meets a man with a
  golden arm. In this case Felix Organ. Worcestershire 33 for one. Looks quite
  chilly at Scarborough today, whites whistling in the breeze. Bess strolls in,
  five men close enough to whisper sweet nothings into Carson’s ear. And 50 for
  Hudson-Prentice – applause from the crowd, indifference from the seagulls.
  Sussex 188-7. I’ve got a bad feeling about this Worcestershire innings. And
  they’re still twiddling their thumbs at Wantage Road. Northants just need six
  more Derbyshire wickets. Sussex are solidity itself, 180-7, trail Yorks by
  143. Somerset less so – four down, the lead at Trent Bridge a mere 18.
  Declaration made, gauntlet thrown. Handshakes all round as last man Jimmy
  Anderson is bowled after trying to slog-sweep Mason Crane. A fantastic win for
  Glamorgan – thanks hugely to nine for 126 in the match for Mason Crane.
  Glamorgan shuffle more comfortably in their promotion chair. Lancs aren’t
  mathematically out of it - 38 points adrift of second place with three games
  remaining. Old Trafford: Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec BEAT Lancashire 137 and
  318 by 154 runs. Glamorgan 20 points, Lancashire 3 points. A tall, slim figure
  walks back towards the dressing room after pushing forward to a peach of a
  ball that pitches middle and chef kisses the top of off. A third wicket for
  Kellaway, and Jimmy Anderson emerges into the gloom. The last time Glamorgan
  won a Championship game at OT was 1993, when, to pick something at random from
  the internet, Czechoslovakia split into two. How are things going at
  Scarborough? Hudson-Prentice and Carson are doing a stirling job, together now
  for nearly 20 overs, if with not many trinkets to show for it in terms of
  runs. Sussex 171 for seven, still 152 behind. Harris out! An inside edge onto
  pad and into the hands of leg slip, Carlson’s grin beaming through his grill
  like foglights. Lancs 287-8, Balderson and Hartley the gatekeepers. Farewell
  Andy Umeed, thank you for the entertainment, and good luck in your cricketing
  endeavours. The players are out everywhere, except Wantage Road. After a fiery
  OT chilli, a blatant advert for a man along the row from me, Jamie Bowman.
  Jamie makes excellent chutney, played John Squires in 24 hour Party People and
  now has a cricket podcast, mostly concentrating on Merseyside and Lancashire.
  Do give it a listen. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT
  Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec and 60-1 v
  Warwickshire 485 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 544 v Somerset 438 and 72-2 New
  Road: Worcestershire 249 v Hampshire 293 and 235-6 Scarborough: Yorkshire
  545-9dec v Sussex 222 and 166-7 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1
  v Middlesex 445 no play yet today Canterbury: Kent 307-5 v Leicestershire 471
  Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 and 274-7 v Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec Lancs need
  199 to win Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v Derbyshire 377 and 52-4 no
  play yet today More shouts from Kellaway and Crane, but Balderson and Harris –
  who has completed an excellent 50 – make it till lunch. The skies are
  darkening again. A seventh at OT, and a second wicket for Kellaway. After two
  rather lovely fours, Chris Green sweeps – onto his pad? - and Carlson pops up
  at silly point to swallow the catch. Lancs 270-7. What a stonking catch by
  Calvin Harris to dismiss Josh Davey at Trent Bridge. And now at OT, a
  hot-off-the-press inswinging yorker from Fernando to send nightwatchman Bailey
  on his way. Deserved a better victim really. Fernando crosses himself at the
  top of his run, Lancs 259-6, enter Chris Green. A wicket at New Road – Gubbins
  fencing at Ben Allison, Hants 197 for four – and, more pertinently, two at
  Trent Bridge, where Notts have got rid of Gregory and Davey within three
  balls, Somerset 36 for two and 70 behind. Now bright sunshine at OT. Kellaway
  wheels in from the Statham end, Harris dabs dangerously wide of slip. Those
  who were here yesterday report that it isn’t turning as much as it was then,
  when the odd ball ripped square. Lancs 242 for five, the target 473. 68 overs
  in the day, if the day is kind. Unfortunately for Derbyshire. Will Sutherland
  makes the breakthrough at Scarborough, Lamb the man gone, for a 52-minutes
  seven. Yorkshire just three wickets away. A 12.15 start here at OT, with
  twenty overs lost. A member of the groundstaff is currently polishing a stump
  with a yellow rag. A handful of hardy supporters shuffle in cagoles under the
  Point, and the party stand sits empty wet and damp, its rows of grey seats
  like braces awaiting eager teeth. Four matches in play: Essex are one down –
  Noah Thain caught for two – a lead of 132. If they get a hurry up, it is
  possible they could make a game of things. Notts have lost four during a
  morning Somerset counter attack. Somerset start their second innings with a
  deficit of 106. And John Simpson is currently wiping the tape after his leave
  toJack White at Scarborough, Sussex 135-6. And in Division Two: Ben Compton
  bats on, 129, though Leicestershire have wheedled out Garrett and Dawkins.
  Kent 249-5. Somerst The groundstaff are peeling back the covers here, an
  inspection at 11.45. Rain also at New Road, Cheltenham and Northampton. Paul
  Edwards, sitting next to me at OT, is purring about watching Dan Lawrence. He
  references Pinter, That beautiful evening Compton made 70 – “I’d never seen
  anything to compare it to until Lawrence made 78 off 77 balls at Scarborough.
  And again, his 88 off 116 balls at the Riverside. Magnificent.” A tasty
  snippet from the press box that one of Matthew Revis’ former coaches thinks
  he’s the nearest thing to Andrew Flintoff since, well, Andrew Flintoff.
  Through the puddles, past the Glamorgan coach (painted with a daffodil) and
  the OT floodlights shine like headlights in the November mist. Conditions are
  wet and looking wetter. Note for HPG – Chris Green (and Emma Lamb) are
  Lancashire’s players of the month. Poor Chris Woakes, labours through four
  Tests and into number five, only to crash land badly while fielding on the
  boundary and damage his left shoulder. He won’t play again in this Test.
  Manchester skies are now very grey… Three baby pheasants scuttled in the
  over-ripe August undergrowth on my dog walk this morning, which after a weasel
  in the graveyard and a hare and a deer from the train window last night,
  somewhere between Malton and York, makes it a happy few days. Not so happy for
  Durham’s head coach Ryan Campbell after yesterday’s defeat by Surrey. “We can
  either put our heads down and cry in the corner or we can get in a battle and
  that’s what I know this group are going to do.” he said. “So those next three
  games are going to be exciting stuff.” Rory Burns was more prosaic,
  Championship pennant within reach: “That was a massive win for us, especially
  with the Kookaburra ball….we’ve been on a bit of a road trip up here, so to
  get this game done a day early is very pleasing.” Surrey went clear of the
  rest at Chester-le-Street, a three-day win against Durham that puts them in
  prime position to swan gracefully in and collect their fourth Championship on
  the trot, with just three matches left in the season. India’s tall, elegant,
  slow left-armer Sai Kishore did exactly what he was signed for, zinging the
  Kookaburra through Durham, finishing with five for 72. Meanwhile Jordan Clark
  gave the Overtons a run for their money by hitting younger brother Graham, who
  had batted very nicely for 42, on the grill with a stinging bouncer. Surrey,
  needing 176 for victory, had a mild wobble when they lost Ryan Patel and Rory
  Burns in consecutive overs, but 40 from Sam Curran set the sails fair. Things
  don’t look so rosy for Durham who, if Yorkshire win on Friday, have their
  boots in the relegation zone. Durham must also ride disquiet from members, who
  were unhappy to be told at an evening forum that the club would be voting for
  a conference structure for 2026. Nottinghamshire, who were sitting on Surrey’s
  coat-tails before this round, look certain to slip further behind despite a
  wonderful 208 from Haseeb Hameed, which made him the leading run-scorer in
  Division One. With the game still marooned in the first innings, and Somerset
  bowling with a 151-over ball, a draw seems inevitable. Matthew Revis danced to
  his third century in July, his unbeaten 152 putting Yorkshire in a dominant
  position at North Marine Road. Sussex, 323 runs behind on first-innings, made
  a dog’s breakfast of the start of their second, perhaps unnerved by the bangs
  coming from the naval warfare re-enactment at nearby Peasholm Park – three
  times a week in the school holidays. Imam-ul-Haq’s swooping run out and
  throw-down from extra cover to dismiss Tom Alsop would have had uncle
  Inzamam’s approval, if from the sofa. Unbeaten fifties from Daniel Hughes and
  Danial Ibrahim gave Sussex something to chew on overnight. Centuries from
  Justin Broad and Rob Keogh bulldozed Northants to 550-9dec, weary Derbyshire
  then lost four wickets. Sonny Baker’s five wickets for Hampshire will have
  given his Lions’ tour prospects a boost, Jake Libby propped up Worcestershire
  with an unbeaten 100. Nightwatchman Ethan Bamber flew to his first first-class
  century and helped Warwickshire avoid the follow-on at Chelmsford. And
  Lancashire had a bad day at Old Trafford, finishing with half the side out and
  247 runs needed. Just 9.5 overs were possible at Canterbury and there was no
  play at Cheltenham. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT
  Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire

  Trafford: Lancashire 137 and 226-5 v Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec
  Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v Derbyshire 377 and 52-4 Good morning
  from Manchester, where the the clouds have settled into their customary
  block-out-the-sun position as the calendar turns into August. It’s a while
  till we meet here again, so do join us for the last day of this summer round
  of matches. Play starts at 11am everywhere apart from the Riverside, where
  Surrey Sellotaped up another win in three days and head into September
  polishing their brass buttons.

Bess strolls in, five men close enough to whisper sweet nothings into Carson’s ear. And 50 for Hudson-Prentice – applause from the crowd, indifference from the seagulls. Sussex 188-7. I’ve got a bad feeling about this Worcestershire innings. And they’re still twiddling their thumbs at Wantage Road. Northants just need six more Derbyshire wickets. Sussex are solidity itself, 180-7, trail Yorks by 143. Somerset less so – four down, the lead at Trent Bridge a mere 18. Declaration made, gauntlet thrown. Handshakes all round as last man Jimmy Anderson is bowled after trying to slog-sweep Mason Crane. A fantastic win for Glamorgan – thanks hugely to nine for 126 in the match for Mason Crane. Glamorgan shuffle more comfortably in their promotion chair. Lancs aren’t mathematically out of it - 38 points adrift of second place with three games remaining. Old Trafford: Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec BEAT Lancashire 137 and 318 by 154 runs. Glamorgan 20 points, Lancashire 3 points. A tall, slim figure walks back towards the dressing room after pushing forward to a peach of a ball that pitches middle and chef kisses the top of off. A third wicket for Kellaway, and Jimmy Anderson emerges into the gloom. The last time Glamorgan won a Championship game at OT was 1993, when, to pick something at random from the internet, Czechoslovakia split into two. How are things going at Scarborough? Hudson-Prentice and Carson are doing a stirling job, together now for nearly 20 overs, if with not many trinkets to show for it in terms of runs. Sussex 171 for seven, still 152 behind. Harris out! An inside edge onto pad and into the hands of leg slip, Carlson’s grin beaming through his grill like foglights. Lancs 287-8, Balderson and Hartley the gatekeepers. Farewell Andy Umeed, thank you for the entertainment, and good luck in your cricketing endeavours. The players are out everywhere, except Wantage Road. After a fiery OT chilli, a blatant advert for a man along the row from me, Jamie Bowman. Jamie makes excellent chutney, played John Squires in 24 hour Party People and now has a cricket podcast, mostly concentrating on Merseyside and Lancashire. Do give it a listen. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec and 60-1 v Warwickshire 485 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 544 v Somerset 438 and 72-2 New Road: Worcestershire 249 v Hampshire 293 and 235-6 Scarborough: Yorkshire 545-9dec v Sussex 222 and 166-7 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 no play yet today Canterbury: Kent 307-5 v Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 and 274-7 v Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec Lancs need 199 to win Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v Derbyshire 377 and 52-4 no play yet today More shouts from Kellaway and Crane, but Balderson and Harris – who has completed an excellent 50 – make it till lunch. The skies are darkening again. A seventh at OT, and a second wicket for Kellaway. After two rather lovely fours, Chris Green sweeps – onto his pad? - and Carlson pops up at silly point to swallow the catch. Lancs 270-7. What a stonking catch by Calvin Harris to dismiss Josh Davey at Trent Bridge. And now at OT, a hot-off-the-press inswinging yorker from Fernando to send nightwatchman Bailey on his way. Deserved a better victim really. Fernando crosses himself at the top of his run, Lancs 259-6, enter Chris Green. A wicket at New Road – Gubbins fencing at Ben Allison, Hants 197 for four – and, more pertinently, two at Trent Bridge, where Notts have got rid of Gregory and Davey within three balls, Somerset 36 for two and 70 behind. Now bright sunshine at OT. Kellaway wheels in from the Statham end, Harris dabs dangerously wide of slip. Those who were here yesterday report that it isn’t turning as much as it was then, when the odd ball ripped square. Lancs 242 for five, the target 473. 68 overs in the day, if the day is kind. Unfortunately for Derbyshire. Will Sutherland makes the breakthrough at Scarborough, Lamb the man gone, for a 52-minutes seven. Yorkshire just three wickets away. A 12.15 start here at OT, with twenty overs lost. A member of the groundstaff is currently polishing a stump with a yellow rag. A handful of hardy supporters shuffle in cagoles under the Point, and the party stand sits empty wet and damp, its rows of grey seats like braces awaiting eager teeth. Four matches in play: Essex are one down – Noah Thain caught for two – a lead of 132. If they get a hurry up, it is possible they could make a game of things. Notts have lost four during a morning Somerset counter attack. Somerset start their second innings with a deficit of 106. And John Simpson is currently wiping the tape after his leave toJack White at Scarborough, Sussex 135-6. And in Division Two: Ben Compton bats on, 129, though Leicestershire have wheedled out Garrett and Dawkins. Kent 249-5. Somerst The groundstaff are peeling back the covers here, an inspection at 11.45. Rain also at New Road, Cheltenham and Northampton. Paul Edwards, sitting next to me at OT, is purring about watching Dan Lawrence. He references Pinter, That beautiful evening Compton made 70 – “I’d never seen anything to compare it to until Lawrence made 78 off 77 balls at Scarborough. And again, his 88 off 116 balls at the Riverside. Magnificent.” A tasty snippet from the press box that one of Matthew Revis’ former coaches thinks he’s the nearest thing to Andrew Flintoff since, well, Andrew Flintoff. Through the puddles, past the Glamorgan coach (painted with a daffodil) and the OT floodlights shine like headlights in the November mist. Conditions are wet and looking wetter. Note for HPG – Chris Green (and Emma Lamb) are Lancashire’s players of the month. Poor Chris Woakes, labours through four Tests and into number five, only to crash land badly while fielding on the boundary and damage his left shoulder. He won’t play again in this Test. Manchester skies are now very grey… Three baby pheasants scuttled in the over-ripe August undergrowth on my dog walk this morning, which after a weasel in the graveyard and a hare and a deer from the train window last night, somewhere between Malton and York, makes it a happy few days. Not so happy for Durham’s head coach Ryan Campbell after yesterday’s defeat by Surrey. “We can either put our heads down and cry in the corner or we can get in a battle and that’s what I know this group are going to do.” he said. “So those next three games are going to be exciting stuff.” Rory Burns was more prosaic, Championship pennant within reach: “That was a massive win for us, especially with the Kookaburra ball….we’ve been on a bit of a road trip up here, so to get this game done a day early is very pleasing.” Surrey went clear of the rest at Chester-le-Street, a three-day win against Durham that puts them in prime position to swan gracefully in and collect their fourth Championship on the trot, with just three matches left in the season. India’s tall, elegant, slow left-armer Sai Kishore did exactly what he was signed for, zinging the Kookaburra through Durham, finishing with five for 72. Meanwhile Jordan Clark gave the Overtons a run for their money by hitting younger brother Graham, who had batted very nicely for 42, on the grill with a stinging bouncer. Surrey, needing 176 for victory, had a mild wobble when they lost Ryan Patel and Rory Burns in consecutive overs, but 40 from Sam Curran set the sails fair. Things don’t look so rosy for Durham who, if Yorkshire win on Friday, have their boots in the relegation zone. Durham must also ride disquiet from members, who were unhappy to be told at an evening forum that the club would be voting for a conference structure for 2026. Nottinghamshire, who were sitting on Surrey’s coat-tails before this round, look certain to slip further behind despite a wonderful 208 from Haseeb Hameed, which made him the leading run-scorer in Division One. With the game still marooned in the first innings, and Somerset bowling with a 151-over ball, a draw seems inevitable. Matthew Revis danced to his third century in July, his unbeaten 152 putting Yorkshire in a dominant position at North Marine Road. Sussex, 323 runs behind on first-innings, made a dog’s breakfast of the start of their second, perhaps unnerved by the bangs coming from the naval warfare re-enactment at nearby Peasholm Park – three times a week in the school holidays. Imam-ul-Haq’s swooping run out and throw-down from extra cover to dismiss Tom Alsop would have had uncle Inzamam’s approval, if from the sofa. Unbeaten fifties from Daniel Hughes and Danial Ibrahim gave Sussex something to chew on overnight. Centuries from Justin Broad and Rob Keogh bulldozed Northants to 550-9dec, weary Derbyshire then lost four wickets. Sonny Baker’s five wickets for Hampshire will have given his Lions’ tour prospects a boost, Jake Libby propped up Worcestershire with an unbeaten 100. Nightwatchman Ethan Bamber flew to his first first-class century and helped Warwickshire avoid the follow-on at Chelmsford. And Lancashire had a bad day at Old Trafford, finishing with half the side out and 247 runs needed. Just 9.5 overs were possible at Canterbury and there was no play at Cheltenham.

It’s a while till we meet here again, so do join us for the last day of this summer round of matches. Play starts at 11am everywhere apart from the Riverside, where Surrey Sellotaped up another win in three days and head into September polishing their brass buttons.
