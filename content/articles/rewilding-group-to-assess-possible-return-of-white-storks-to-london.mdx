  An urban rewilding group is seeking the public’s views on the potential return
  of white storks to London as part of a project to see if the birds could make
  a home in the capital. White storks could once be seen flying in Britain’s
  skies and building their huge nests on roofs and in trees, but they
  disappeared centuries ago as a breeding bird as a result of hunting and
  habitat loss. Citizen Zoo, an organisation that specialises in community-led
  urban rewilding, is conducting an appraisal on making London a “white
  stork-friendly city”. It will include habitat mapping, contacting boroughs
  across the capital to gauge their interest and surveying the public about the
  birds. The White Stork Project in Sussex has sought to create new colonies of
  rehabilitated injured birds at Knepp and Wadhurst Park since 2016. These can
  act as a “magnet” for wild birds that visit from the continent, and the
  project’s first breeding success was in 2020. In the four decades before the
  start of the project there were just 27 records of white storks across Greater
  London, but there were 472 sightings between 2016 and 2023, with the numbers
  increasing year on year, conservationists said. Elliot Newton, a co-founder of
  Citizen Zoo and its director of rewilding, said: “If you look across European
  landscapes, this is a bird that can actually thrive in urban landscapes. What
  we want to see is how we can make London a more white stork-friendly
  environment, and embrace it for its ability to inspire people about the nature
  we can and should have close to where we live.” The survey is being led by Dr
  Rachel White, of the University of Brighton, with two phases that mirror a
  national survey she conducted as part of the White Stork Project in Sussex.
  The first phase has involved surveying a representative sample of 1,000
  Londoners, and the second phase is asking residents and frequent visitors to
  give their views on white storks and their place in the capital. The London
  survey will feed into Citizen Zoo’s wider assessment of the political and
  public enthusiasm and habitat availability for storks, and potential next
  steps such as creating more habitat to encourage natural colonisation or even
  a release similar to that in Sussex. Citizen Zoo has previously worked with
  communities to bring beavers back to Ealing, reintroduce water voles in Surrey
  and restore wetlands in the capital.
