  The father of a “lifelong” Oasis fan who fell to his death at the band’s
  concert at Wembley Stadium has said his whole family is devastated. Lee
  Claydon, 45, a landscape gardener from Bournemouth, Dorset, died on Saturday
  after reportedly falling from an upper tier at the stadium. His father, Clive
  Claydon, 75, paid tribute to “a hard-working family man” who “loved his kid”.
  “He was a lovely bloke, loved to be with his family … He had everything going
  for him. I am so devastated,” he said. He said that Lee had gone to the
  concert with his brother and his brother’s children, and may have drunk
  alcohol but had not taken any drugs. Claydon said: “He doesn’t take drugs, he
  may have had a couple of beers but who hadn’t there? People have said horrible
  things but it was just an accident.” He added that he was concerned about the
  safety measures at Wembley. “All I know is there was beer everywhere, it’s
  slippery, he slipped apparently, we do not know the rest of it, there’s
  questions about the barriers.” A fundraising page, which has been set up to
  help raise money for Lee’s partner, Amanda, and son, Harry, has reached more
  than £7,000. Lee’s brother Aaron Claydon wrote on the page: “Our family has
  been turned upside down and are struggling to deal with this devastation and
  unexpected loss. Lee was a loving family man who was a role model to his son.”
  He described his brother as “the man I have always looked up to”. He added:
  “Lee would have done anything for any of us and he was taken from us far too
  soon, and we will miss him so very much.” A spokesperson for Wembley Stadium
  said: “Wembley Stadium operates to a very high health and safety standard,
  fully meeting legal requirements for the safety of spectators and staff, and
  is certified to and compliant with the ISO 45001 standard. “We work very
  closely and collaboratively with all relevant event delivery stakeholders –
  including event owners, local authorities, the Sports Grounds Safety Authority
  and the police – to deliver events to high standards of safety, security and
  service for everyone attending or working in the venue.” The Health and Safety
  Executive has been informed. The Metropolitan police are asking for anyone who
  witnessed the incident, or has mobile phone footage, to come forward. Oasis
  said in a statement on Sunday: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the
  tragic death of a fan at the show. Oasis would like to extend our sincere
  condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.”
