  Nuno Espírito Santo could not guarantee that he will remain as Nottingham
  Forest’s manager after the end of the transfer window as he prepares to meet
  with owner Evangelos Marinakis this week to resolve their differences. Nuno is
  believed to have fallen out with Marinakis and sporting director Edu Gaspar
  over transfers and revealed on Friday that his relationship with the Greek
  owner has suffered this season. He is due to meet both in the coming days,
  although the Forest manager insisted that he has no intention of walking out.
  “This narrative is absurd,” said Nuno after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s equaliser
  ensured Forest made it 10 league games without defeat against Crystal Palace
  as they survived a cauldron of noise created by the home supporters still
  seething at their demotion from the Europa League. But asked whether he is
  confident of still being Forest manager after this month, he added: “I cannot
  answer that question, but what I know is that I’m working and trying to do my
  job the best that I can. Of course the situation has to be solved and we are
  responsible players and we’re going to have a good conversation to try to
  create more than anything a good platform for what is more important, the
  team.” Marinakis, who has been blamed by Palace for his role in the decision
  after Forest wrote to Uefa urging them to investigate whether their Premier
  League rivals had breached multi-club ownership regulations, did not attend
  the 1-1 draw that saw a banner unveiled midway through the first half which
  took aim at the Greek billionaire. Edu was at Selhurst Park as Nuno brought
  four new signings off the bench in the second half but admitted he would like
  to bring in more players before the window closes. “I believe so,” he
  responded when asked if he can repair his relationship with Marinakis.
  “Everybody wants the best for Forest. Me first, the president first and all
  the club wants the best for Forest. And I always, during my career, I think
  it’s the first time that I’m facing a situation and being asked these things.
  It’s not helpful, but I believe work with conflict doesn’t work out. What we
  did last season together will stick forever in our memories. This is the
  responsibility that we have to our club. Ignore the noise and work hard.”
  Oliver Glasner is also desperate for investment in Palace’s squad after
  Eberechi Eze’s club record sale to Arsenal and he seemed hopeful that they
  will get their business completed in time after new American billionaire
  co-owner Woody Johnson was spotted mingling with fans before the game. “I
  don’t talk about the players we are looking for because it just makes it more
  expensive. It’s pretty clear what we need,” he said. “We are competing in four
  competitions this season and if you lose one of your top stars who had 14
  goals and 12 assists [last season] then it’s pretty clear we need to replace
  him with a starter. This is what we are looking for and I’m pretty sure we
  will get it done.” The Football Association is to investigate a banner
  depicting Marinakis that was displayed by Crystal Palace fans in the
  Holmesdale End during the first half.
