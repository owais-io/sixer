  For Those I Love: Carving the Stone review – bracing anger at Irish social
  stasis 
sectionName: Music

bodyText: >-
  On his 2021 debut as For Those I Love, David Balfe closed the gap between
  performance poetry, moody 1980s synthpop and sample-stuffed electronica to
  craft an evocative eulogy for his friend Paul Curran, who died by suicide in
  2018. The result was Kae Tempest meets New Order via the densely referential
  lyrics of Real Lies; a set of songs steeped in lump-in-the-throat nostalgia
  for more innocent times, and in the muted echoes of dancefloor euphoria. On
  this follow-up, the Dublin musician – now in his early 30s – adjusts his
  subject while clinging tightly to his fury and devastation. Aside from The
  Ox/The Afters, a tribute to a former hardman who dies from drink, there’s not
  much literal grief on Carving the Stone – but Balfe is still in mourning. His
  psychic wound is more abstract now, a slow-blooming bruise caused by the
  brutal Irish economy and the tech-addled meaninglessness of modernity. Over a
  boisterously ravey backdrop, No Scheme chronicles the lifestyles of Balfe’s
  erstwhile contemporaries (“life above their means / And driven mad by phone
  scams and everyday still spent on Facebook”), while Mirror rages against
  “cunting blackshirts” who promote nationalistic beliefs to the workers they
  exploit. Carving the Stone’s portraits of new kinds of poverty are too
  depressing – and depressingly accurate – to be beautiful, although the music
  offers occasional bursts of strange joy (Civic’s frantic breakbeat; the fiddle
  break in Of the Sorrows), while Balfe’s heartfelt, hyper-focused social
  commentary means it’s rare to find an album this rich in meaning.
