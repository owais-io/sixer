  Releasing just 20 lynx in Northumberland would be enough to create a healthy
  wild population, research has found, and most people in the area would support
  the practice. Northumberland Wildlife Trust has been working to see if the
  wild cats, which became extinct in Britain about 1,300 years ago as a result
  of hunting and habitat loss, could be returned to the area. In a paper
  published in the Journal of Environmental Management, modelling studies found
  that lynx would be able to thrive in the area. The study found a release of 20
  lynx over several years into the Kielder Forest area would over time create a
  healthy population of about 50 animals covering north-west Northumberland, the
  edge of Cumbria and the bordering areas of southern Scotland. The researchers
  said it was the only area of England and Wales with enough woodland for lynx
  to thrive. Conservationists supporting the reintroduction of the lynx to the
  UK say it could bring many benefits such as hunting deer that overpopulate
  woodlands and eat bark off trees, which destroys them. The shy animals are
  slightly smaller than a labrador and prefer large areas of dense woodland in
  which to roam. The areas in which they could be released successfully in the
  UK are limited, as most forests are no longer big enough. The animal has been
  reintroduced in several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland and
  France. Due to its wealth of woodland, the Wildlife Trusts pinpointed
  Northumberland as an ideal place to explore the feasibility of returning the
  wild cat. A year-long consultation found that 72% of people within the project
  area supported the reintroduction of the animal. The group also talked to
  farmers, some of whom were concerned about the possibility of lynx taking
  their sheep, and ran a trip to European countries where lynx have been
  reintroduced. The farmers met agricultural workers and people who have been
  living alongside the wild cat for decades. Lauren Harrison, who has a sheep
  farm in Cumbria, near Hadrian’s Wall, said: “I saw in Europe that it’s
  possible to live alongside lynx. The risks to livestock can be minimal and
  there are so many positives. Tourism is an obvious one, but I also think a
  more balanced ecosystem is beneficial to farmers. “I’ve been really impressed
  with the approach and the professionalism of the Missing Lynx Project. I think
  it’s really setting the standard for reintroduction projects. Consultation has
  been at the heart of everything they do. They have really listened and are
  still keen to work with farmers to make sure any reintroduction is well
  managed. “I’d urge other farmers to engage with them and take some ownership
  of the project. The wider public clearly supports a lynx reintroduction and
  this is a great chance to help make it happen with so little risk to our
  businesses.” The Wildlife Trusts were at the forefront of the campaign to
  bring beavers back to England, which happened legally for the first time this
  year after the government finally approved the releases. Ministers would have
  to approve any release of lynx into the wild. Dr Rob Stoneman, the director of
  landscape recovery at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “Bringing back lynx could
  benefit wildlife more widely, something that is sorely needed in this
  nature-depleted country. We have pushed many native species to extinction, and
  it makes sense to bring missing wildlife back where feasible. “Bison and
  beavers have invigorated degraded habitats and this consultation shows there
  is now an opportunity for us to bring back lynx too.”
