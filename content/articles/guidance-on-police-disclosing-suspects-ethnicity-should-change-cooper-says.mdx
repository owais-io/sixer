  Official guidance should change to permit police to release the ethnicity or
  immigration status of criminal suspects, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper,
  has said. Cooper said the government had asked the Law Commission to review
  this six months ago. The row over information withheld by police has been
  reignited after the Reform UK leader of Warwickshire county council said
  police were refusing to confirm details of two suspects charged after an
  alleged rape in Nuneaton. Keir Starmer has previously said such information
  should be given as part of rebuilding public trust in the wake of the spread
  of mass disinformation after the Southport murders last year. Speaking on BBC
  Radio 4’s Today programme, Cooper said she hoped the Law Commission would
  accelerate its review around contempt of court and the information that could
  be released when a trial was pending. “We do think the guidance needs to
  change,” she said, adding that it was already the case that where police
  deemed it necessary more information on nationality was released. She referred
  to a case where Iranian nationals were charged with spying offences in May,
  and the Crown Prosecution Service revealed that three of them had arrived
  either on small boats or a lorry. She said: “It is an operational decision for
  the police and Crown Prosecution Service on an individual case, what and when
  information can be revealed in a live investigation. However, we do think that
  the guidance needs to change, the College of Policing is already looking at
  this, and Home Office officials are working with the College of Policing.” Two
  men have been charged in connection with the alleged rape of a 12-year-old
  girl in Nuneaton last month. Ahmad Mulakhil has been charged with rape and
  Mohammad Kabir has been charged with kidnap and strangulation. Warwickshire
  county council’s leader, George Finch, has alleged that the two men are asylum
  seekers. In a statement after the charges, Warwickshire police said: “Once
  someone is charged with an offence, we follow national guidance. This guidance
  does not include sharing ethnicity or immigration status.” Cooper said the
  data collected on crimes committed by people of different ethnicities and
  immigration status was “patchy” and that changes had been started late last
  year to improve it. “There is some data recorded but often it’s not really
  robust enough. So I think we’re going further than any government has done
  before in terms of trying to make sure that there is robust and transparent
  data,” she told the Today programme. She said ministers had to take care not
  prejudice a trial by the release of information. “We do need to recognise that
  there are times in court processes where there are legal issues where the
  Crown Prosecution Service will currently say: that particular pieces of
  information cannot be provided, where we may well think that they should be
  provided. “But I have been clear. We do think there should be greater
  transparency. We do think more information should be provided, including on
  issues around nationality, including on some of those asylum issues,” she
  said.
