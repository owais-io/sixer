  The family of a man whose body was found in a Hull funeral home after he was
  supposed to have been cremated have said it is “easier to open a funeral
  directors than it is a sandwich shop”, as they urged the government to
  regulate the industry. Michaela Baldwin said she had assumed funeral directors
  were subject to some regulation when her family used one in Hull after the
  death of her stepfather, Danny Middleton. “I’ve always thought that funeral
  parlours, funeral directors, anyone who deals with bodies have to have
  licences and regulations,” she said. After the funeral, the family were given
  what they were told were Middleton’s ashes by Legacy funeral directors, only
  to be contacted later by police when his body was found uncremated at its
  Hessle Road premises. Funeral director Robert Bush, 47, has been charged with
  30 counts of preventing a lawful and decent burial and 30 counts of fraud by
  false representation after 35 bodies and “a quantity” of human ashes were
  discovered there. He has yet to enter a plea and is on bail until a hearing on
  15 October. Other families, MPs and funeral industry organisations have joined
  Baldwin in calling for urgent action to regulate the sector in England, Wales
  and Northern Ireland. Full statutory regulation is already in place in
  Scotland. The renewed call comes days after a mother said she was left
  screaming after seeing her baby’s body propped up in front of the TV at the
  home of a funeral director in Leeds. Zoe Ward said she had expected her baby
  son Bleu, who died in hospital in 2021 of brain damage, to be kept in a
  professional setting instead of the home of Amie Upton, who runs a baby
  bereavement service that includes providing baby clothing and taking
  handprints. Upton has since been banned from hospitals in Leeds and had been
  reported to the police but West Yorkshire police said no crimes had been
  committed. Baldwin, who does not know whose ashes her family received, said
  she previously had no idea the industry was subject to no legal requirements.
  She said: “It’s out of respect and dignity that it needs to be regulated ...
  It’s easier to open a funeral directors than it is a sandwich shop.” This call
  was backed by MPs including Mark Sewards and Emma Hardy, whose constituents
  were affected by the Leeds and Hull cases. It was also supported by the two
  trade organisations for the funeral industry – the National Association of
  Funeral Directors (NAFD), which represents a large portion of the profession,
  and the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF),
  which tends to represent smaller, family-run funeral directors. About 80% of
  funeral directors are members of either NAFD or SAIF, which have similar codes
  of practice and carry out independent inspections, but membership is not
  compulsory and there is no oversight at all for those who do not join. Both
  organisations said they had been pushing the government but it needed to move
  more quickly to regulate. Declan Maguire, the author of a co-regulator
  proposal that has already been submitted to the government, who is also a
  member of SAIF’s executive committee, said the organisation was waiting “for
  government to give us the green light”. He said regulation was working in
  Scotland, where 10% of the UK’s funerals take place, and the Scottish model
  could quickly and easily be implemented in the other nations. He added: “It
  doesn’t take much to get the ball rolling, it just takes a response from
  government to say: ‘OK, let’s start work.’ We’re ready to go essentially.”
  Andrew Judd, the chief executive of NAFD, said unlike marriages, of which some
  people have multiple, “you only get one funeral”. Judd highlighted the Fuller
  inquiry, held to investigate issues raised after the crimes of hospital
  maintenance worker David Fuller, who was jailed in 2021 for murdering two
  women and abusing at least 100 dead women and girls in the mortuary of the
  now-closed Kent and Sussex hospital and the Tunbridge Wells hospital, over a
  15-year period. The inquiry made recommendations including a licensing scheme,
  mandatory standards and regular inspections. Judd said: “The Fuller inquiry
  concluded that it’s an urgent matter. And we still haven’t heard anything
  about what happens next.” He added: “Until we get some kind of formal statute
  to support the work of trade associations, these things are going to happen.
  And when they do happen, the consequences last a lifetime.” A government
  spokesperson said: “We are committed to taking action to ensure the highest
  standards are always met by funeral directors, and are now considering the
  full range of options to improve standards.”
