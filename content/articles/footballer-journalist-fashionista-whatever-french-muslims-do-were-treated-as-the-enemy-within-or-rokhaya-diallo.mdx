  Being a Muslim in a country with a long colonial history, which has also had
  to deal with terrorist attacks carried out in the name of Islam, is an
  everyday challenge. In January 2015, for example, I was as profoundly shocked
  as everyone else in France by the massacre of the Charlie Hebdo journalists in
  Paris. As the country mourned, I was invited by a major radio station to
  comment, but was first asked, live on air, to “dissociate” myself from the
  attackers. I had been critical of Charlie Hebdo’s publications in the past,
  but my comments always fell within the scope of legitimate political debate.
  Nevertheless, as a Muslim, I was now treated as if I was under suspicion. In
  order to be tolerated on the airwaves, I had to profess my innocence: state
  publicly that I had nothing to do with the violence. I couldn’t hold back my
  tears – because, even with a media profile, I was reduced to the most racist
  perception of my identity. I was strongly defended that night by others who
  took part in the show, and received much support online, but I couldn’t help
  thinking of the millions of French Muslims who, unlike me, would have no
  microphone to defend themselves against vile accusations. Some years later I
  was invited to take part in a TV debate on the thesis: is the white man always
  guilty. I was expecting a conversation about gender and race. But my opponent,
  the philosopher Pascal Bruckner, immediately took me to task, claiming that I
  had used my status “as a Black, Muslim woman” to incite hatred against Charlie
  Hebdo. He claimed that I had, in effect, blood on my hands, that my words had
  “led to the murder of 12 people at Charlie Hebdo”. I immediately protested,
  stating as firmly as I could, that I had “absolutely no responsibility for any
  terrorist attack”. But Bruckner wouldn’t let go. He attacked me for having
  signed a joint statement in 2011, following a night-time petrol-bomb attack at
  the Charlie Hebdo premises that caused, fortunately, only material damage.
  Nothing in the statement – which I did not draft and was co-signed by 20 other
  academics and activists– had called for hatred or violence. It had been
  critical of the disproportionate media treatment of the fire at Charlie Hebdo
  when vandalism of Muslim places of worship featured rarely in the news.
  Signatories had expressed dismay at the selective nature of French national
  outrage, highlighting the indifference shown after an arson attack on a Paris
  building inhabited by Roma people, in which a man died. But Bruckner repeated
  his accusations in an interview the next day, claiming without any evidence
  that he had simply “reminded Rokhaya Diallo of her involvement in political
  Islam” adding – as if it were a crime – that I had “criticised Charlie Hebdo
  by calling them Islamophobic and racist”. I felt I had no option but to file a
  defamation lawsuit against Bruckner, believing the accusation to be not just
  outrageous and insulting, but influenced by my origins and my faith. But
  defending myself was viewed as another provocation. Le Figaro, the leading
  conservative daily, published a highly offensive article on the eve of the
  trial, which, without even bothering to interview me, stated: “Inspired by the
  Muslim Brotherhood, ‘anti-racist’ activists like Rokhaya Diallo are
  multiplying lawsuits to silence critics of Islamism.” Taking legal action as a
  Muslim woman was framed as a “jihadist” political plot. This kind of smear
  tactic is used again and again to discredit any Muslim who calls out
  Islamophobia. When the footballer Karim Benzema spoke in support of the people
  of Gaza in October 2023, the then interior minister Gerard Darmanin declared –
  without a shred of evidence – that the player had “well-known ties to the
  Muslim Brotherhood”. In May, a report commissioned by the interior ministry
  into the Muslim Brotherhood fuelled suspicion of all French Muslims by
  recycling conspiracy theories around supposed “infiltration”. The report was
  as the the socio-anthropologist Hamza Esmili put it, “intellectually
  impoverished”. Yet Bruno Retailleau, the current interior minister, used
  alarmist conspiracy tropes to describe its conclusions, claiming it had
  identified “a very clear threat to the republic and to national cohesion” and
  “a quiet form of Islamist infiltration whose ultimate goal is to bring all of
  French society under sharia law”. But even the report stated unequivocally:
  “No recent document demonstrates any intent by Muslims of France to establish
  an Islamic state in France or to enforce sharia law there.” It added that the
  Brotherhood’s members in France today are estimated to number “between 400 and
  1,000 people”. As Esmili argues, French Muslims present a paradox: we are part
  of every social sphere, yet many of us have not given up our cultural
  specificities. And that is precisely what we are blamed for – integration
  without assimilation. This is why the same government can claim it uses the
  law to fight against Muslim “separatism” while denouncing the threat of Muslim
  “infiltration”. Muslims can’t win: we are blamed for being part of the
  national community and for being outside of it. Thus, no matter what level we
  reach in the social pecking order, being Muslim always carries the suspicion
  of association with a radical and dangerous ideology: of being the enemy
  within. So when Léna Situations, a major fashion influencer in France,
  appeared on the Cannes film festival red carpet wearing a long dress with a
  headscarf, a senior official in Emmanuel Macron’s party suggested on social
  media that she was practising a form of religious “infiltration”. As if an
  outfit was in itself proof of extremism. The influencer never mentioned her
  religion but it made no difference – her Algerian heritage alone was enough to
  disqualify her. Even non-Muslims who take a stand against this hostile climate
  are subjected to similar accusations. Emile Ackermann – a rabbi vocal on
  Islamophobia – was accused by a self-proclaimed academic “expert” of being
  inspired by a “Brotherist” discourse. Such absurd accusations would be
  laughable if the situation weren’t so volatile, with Islamophobic crime on the
  increase. Take the case of the hairdresser Hichem Miraoui, killed in June in
  the south of France, in what investigators are treating as a racially
  motivated act of domestic terrorism. Miraoui had been the target of racist
  rhetoric posted on social media by a neighbour who also denounced the French
  state as “incapable of protecting us from Muslims”. Yet, the very same state
  constantly fuels a narrative portraying Muslims as a problem. During the
  defamation lawsuit I launched against Bruckner, and its appeal, my accuser and
  his lawyer leaned into these cliches. While the philosopher repeated his
  accusations and suggested that I was funded by “foreign powers”, his lawyer
  told the court that, given that Charlie Hebdo’s case files amounted to several
  tonnes of documents, no one could say for sure whether my name was not
  mentioned in them. Elyamine Settoul, a political scientist and expert on
  jihadism, testified, however, that terrorists are radicalised through direct
  contacts and in no way rely on intellectual debates or interventions. And the
  expert and former Islamic State hostage Nicolas Hénin testified that my name
  appeared “neither in the legal proceedings concerning the January 2015 attack,
  nor in the research conducted on the subject”. He told the court that “the
  jihadist sphere holds nothing but contempt” for people like me because of my
  “multicultural progressivism, which aligns with none of their religious
  doctrines”. Bruckner was acquitted in the first instance on the grounds that
  he had attributed to me only “purely moral responsibility” and invited me to
  “take ownership of the weight of my words and commitments”. The appeal court
  overturned the initial judgment, recognising the defamatory nature of
  Bruckner’s remarks, yet still acquitted him on the grounds that he had made
  his statement “in good faith”. Just like the “yellow peril” once attributed to
  east Asians, or the supposed “cosmopolitanist” trope used about Jews, the
  image of an allegedly foreign group secretly infiltrating France’s circles of
  influence is once again thriving, in a sadly familiar strain of dangerous
  racist rhetoric. Rokhaya Diallo is a Guardian Europe columnist
