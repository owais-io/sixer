  Eddie Howe has denied suggestions he promised Alexander Isak a transfer out of
  Newcastle this summer but indicated it may be in everyone’s best interests if
  the striker departed. Rumours that Newcastle’s manager had informed Isak he
  would be free to join Liverpool once a replacement was signed have been
  circulating in the 10 days since the striker posted an emotional Instagram
  post talking of “broken promises” but Howe has rejected that notion quite
  vehemently. “Absolutely not,” he said. “I never make any promises to any
  players regarding transfers because, ultimately, I’m not in control of the
  whole thing. I would never make a promise like that to any player.”
  Nonetheless Newcastle’s almost-completed capture of the £70m Germany striker
  Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart has cleared the way for Liverpool to make a
  record bid for Isak. An offer approaching £130m could finally conclude their
  summer-long pursuit of the Swede, who spent most of the close season refusing
  to train with or play for Howe’s team. Until as recently as last week some
  Newcastle executives had appeared determined to keep Isak but that stance has
  now softened appreciably. The mood shifted on Monday when the club’s minority
  owner Jamie Reuben was joined by representatives of the majority stakeholders,
  Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, at Isak’s Northumberland home It is
  understood Isak proved resistant to their attempts to broker a rapprochement
  and was not interested in the offer of a lucrative new contract. Although Howe
  attempted to play a straight bat, he suggested Isak’s determination never to
  play for Newcastle again dictated that it may be the right moment for a richly
  talented player he had initially hoped to keep to exit Tyneside. “Of course I
  would have a preference,” he said regarding whether Isak remained or departed.
  “But ultimately you have got to look at all the information. I have a
  footballing preference but then you have to take everything else into account.
  You can’t just be oblivious to things that have happened. “But I have no
  control over it. That’s for other people to decide. I’m not in control of
  those discussions. I’m focusing on trying to bring new players into the team.”
  Tellingly, Howe – who has not spoken to Isak for about a fortnight and has had
  no contact with the 25-year-old since that provocative Instagram post – is
  hoping Newcastle’s continued pursuit of Brentford’s Yoane Wissa and the Wolves
  centre-forward Jørgen Strand Larsen will equip him with a second attacking
  signing capable of partnering Woltemade. Much to Howe’s frustration, the
  German will sign too late to be involved on Saturday at Leeds, where Newcastle
  are without the suspended Anthony Gordon and the injured Joelinton. Sandro
  Tonali has only an outside chance of passing a late fitness test on a shoulder
  problem. More positively, Joelinton’s groin injury is not regarded as long
  term and Howe hinted his squad’s collective morale had strengthened in Isak’s
  absence. “The squad dynamic is very strong at the moment,” he said. “I
  wouldn’t have said that in the first two weeks of pre-season, though.” Perhaps
  significantly, Isak participated in that opening fortnight before embarking on
  his solitary strike. “The players have been through a lot this summer and
  there was a lot of distraction but, since then, they’ve been really strong,”
  Howe said. “We’re in a really good place now. I think the squad still needs a
  bit of work just in terms of finishing touches to make this a really
  successful window.”
