  Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to bring back the
  presidential fitness test, a series of physical tests for schoolchildren in
  the US that was in place for decades but suspended 12 years ago to focus less
  on competition and more on healthy lifestyles. Trump announced the test’s
  revival in a press event with famous athletes, praising the golfers, football
  players and a pro-wrestler for their achievements and physiques. The executive
  order will also re-establish the president’s council on sports, fitness, and
  nutrition. “This is an important step in our mission to make America healthy
  again,” Trump said in a press conference on Thursday. “It’s something that’s
  very important, what we’re doing, very important. Dating back to the
  administration of President Dwight D Eisenhower, this council has championed
  the vigor and strength and vitality of the American people today. We continue
  that very proud tradition.” The presidential fitness test was required in
  public schools in some form from the late 1950s until 2013, when it was
  changed into a program less focused on specific feats of strength. The test
  involves activities like a one-mile run, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and a
  sit-and-reach. People who participated in the program as children often have
  memories , both fond and not, of their experiences attempting these challenges
  in their gym classes. “It was a big deal. This was a wonderful tradition, and
  we’re bringing it back,” Trump said. “It’s turned out to be very, very popular
  to do.” Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, will administer the fitness
  program. There will also be criteria for a “presidential fitness award”. In
  past iterations of the program, the top 15% of performers would receive the
  award. “MAKE AMERICA FIT AGAIN!” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press
  secretary, wrote in a post on X about reintroducing the test. The fitness test
  aligns with the make America healthy again movement’s focus on physical
  wellness and exercise. Trump, an avid golfer, reportedly believes exercise is
  “misguided”, as a person is “born with a finite amount of energy”, the New
  Yorker reported in 2017.
