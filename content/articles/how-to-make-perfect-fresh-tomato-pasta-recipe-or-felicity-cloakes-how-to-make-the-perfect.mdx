  “How many versions of fresh tomato sauce can there be?” Catherine, the
  generous winner of a charity auction to help me with the research for this
  column, asks when I tell her what recipe we’ll be making. On the contrary, I
  tell her, I’ve had my work cut out to narrow the selection here down to a mere
  seven, not least because the simpler the dish, the more argument there is over
  how it should be prepared, especially in a place as passionate about its food
  as Italy. Happily, I’ll have a lot of assistance, because Catherine has raised
  yet more money for Hospitality Rides (a fundraising initiative for two very
  worthy industry charities, Only a Pavement Away and the Licensed Trade
  Charity), by selling tickets to get other people to do my job for me,
  effectively. In an attempt to sweeten the deal, I tell my assembled minions
  (all hospitality professionals, though none, sadly, Italian chefs) that,
  according to Emiko Davies, this raw sauce is “quite possibly the best way to
  enjoy really good, ripe summer tomatoes – as well as making the most of
  spending as little time in front of a hot stove as possible”. Then I make them
  chop an awful lot of tomatoes in the service of perfection. The tomatoes
  Tomatoes are, in fact, a good place to begin, because, as the late, great cook
  and author Marcella Hazan writes in Marcella Cucina: “The tomato is the thing.
  There is hardly anything to the making of the sauce, which really consists
  just of assembling the ingredients and letting them go to work, but the
  tomatoes have to be ripe and tasty.” Lynne Rossetto Kasper, host of the
  long-running Splendid Table podcast, agrees: “Exceptionally good tomatoes and
  olive oil you want to eat with a spoon are the only requirements for this
  recipe.” She recommends “a variety of tomatoes, if possible – the punchy
  little sweet 100s or sungolds, mellow beefsteaks and maybe one or two sweet
  yellow or orange ones”, a mixture that certainly looks pretty. Rowley Leigh
  counsels cherry tomatoes (“datterini, if possible”) in A Long and Messy
  Business, the River Cafe’s Classic Italian Cookbook a mixture of plum and
  cherry tomatoes, and the late restaurateur Alvaro Maccioni suggests mixing
  fresh and sun-dried fruit in his book Alvaro’s Mamma Toscana. While a range of
  colours pleases the eye, I’d advise going instead for whatever pleases the
  palate most; we have such a short window of really decent tomatoes in the UK
  that it’s important to select for flavour while you can. My preference is
  always for plums, if they look good. As I explain to the group while they
  good-humouredly set about seeding several kilos of fruit, there’s a reason
  these are the variety most often found in tins: they have a higher ratio of
  flesh to watery seeds than most, which means that, in practice, you get more
  for your buck. None of us, it turns out, is a fan of using the sun-dried
  variety in this dish, which, according to Annica, take away from the “purity
  of the dish”, but perhaps we’re not quite over the 1990s yet. However, while I
  hope that Hazan, Del Conte and all the other gods of Italian cookery will
  forgive me, I’m with Daniel Gritzer when he writes on Serious Eats that “I’ve
  never eaten some pasta al pomodoro crudo, spat it out and angrily exclaimed:
  ‘Who, pray tell, left the skins and seeds on these tomatoes?’ The full tomato
  has never bothered me in a pico de gallo, it’s never bothered me in bruschetta
  and it doesn’t bother me here. Frankly, there’s a lot of flavour in those
  seeds, and it’d be a shame to waste it.” So, by all means peel and seed, if
  you like, but personally I wouldn’t bother – ripe tomatoes are a pain to peel,
  and there’s a fair bit of wastage. (You may also, as in Davies’ alternative to
  her roughly chopped fruit, smash the tomatoes in a mortar, but I prefer a
  chunkier sauce here; also, if you go down that road, you will probably need to
  peel them, too.) The treatment In the interest of keeping things simple, I
  bypass recipes such as the one in Lucio Galletto’s The Art of Pasta that are
  “quasi-cotto”, or lightly cooked, in favour of ones that are entirely raw.
  That said, Del Conte does put her sauce mixture in a moderate oven just while
  the pasta is boiling, I assume to warm it and perhaps to encourage the juices
  to run. Marinading rather than cooking is the name of the game here, as Hazan
  explains: “Although this sauce is completely raw, you might say that it cooks
  itself. It is a fine demonstration of the dynamic reaction that ingredients
  can have to each other, if you give them the chance.” Some happily quick and
  easy versions give them this chance just for the few minutes it takes to cook
  the pasta. The River Cafe recommends half an hour, Hazan a full hour. and Del
  Conte “at least two hours”, the latter adding that “it does not matter if you
  leave the sauce to marinate for longer”. If you don’t have half an hour, be
  reassured that such culinary authorities as Davies, Leigh and Rossetto Kasper
  don’t bother with this step at all, though my testers are struck by the
  richness of the River Cafe recipe: “The tomatoes have almost broken down to
  make a sauce,” Catherine observes. At least 30 minutes is ideal, though 15 is
  better than nothing, and two to three hours won’t hurt. It’s also worth
  bearing in mind a top tip from Rossetto Kasper, which I almost miss because
  it’s not included in her actual recipe: “I discovered a trick for making pasta
  with raw tomato sauces taste lustier. Slightly undercook the pasta. Drain it.
  Spoon the juices that raw sauces always throw off into the empty pasta pot.
  Set it over medium-low heat, add the pasta and toss until the juices are
  absorbed, then add the pasta to the sauce.” Very little extra work, and well
  worth it. The pasta “Only boxed factory-made dry pasta is a good match for
  this sauce,” Hazan instructs, “and spaghettini, thin spaghetti, is the most
  strongly recommended shape.” Nevertheless, good old spaghetti is the most
  common choice in the recipes I try, although the River Cafe’s ravioli is a hit
  with my testers, even though I choose one with an entirely unsuitable
  asparagus-based filling. Also popular is Maccioni’s linguine, which Catherine
  declares has “more about it than the spaghetti”, and the aforementioned
  spaghettini, which Anna and I enjoy for its springy, almost ramen-like
  consistency. (Rossetto Kasper’s alternative fusilli does not, according to
  Olivia, “look quite as classy … it’s a bit of a bully texture-wise, so the
  tomatoes get lost”.) A common complaint as the dishes go around the table when
  we’re finally at the tasting stage is that some recipes are a bit mean on the
  tomato. Maccioni uses a mere four tomatoes for four people in contrast to
  Rossetto Kasper’s bountiful 1.35kg.Naturally loth to reduce the quantity of
  pasta, I’ve opted for a similarly generous serving of tomatoes, bearing in
  mind that this is a pasta dish and not a tomato salad (or, God forbid, a pasta
  salad. Do Italians even eat pasta salad? Please let me know in the comments
  below). The extras This is where things really get interesting around the
  table. Good olive oil is, of course, a must, but the two best-rated recipes,
  from Hazan and the River Cafe, also contain red-wine vinegar – something I
  would invariably sprinkle on a fresh tomato salad. The appreciative noises
  (“almost restauranty”, someone says proudly) this elicits strongly suggest
  that it has to be part of my final recipe – though Claire, in particular, is a
  fan of the fresh simplicity of Davies’ vinegar-free version. Salt is also a
  must; a tomato is nothing without it, and there is a feeling that those in
  charge of Del Conte’s recipe (I name no names) have perhaps been a little
  parsimonious on that front: “I only said did it ask for seasoning?” Karina
  demands, laughing. Lesson learned; be generous with the salt, unless you fancy
  Hazan’s slightly more complex Ligurian take complete with black and green
  olives, capers and anchovies, in which case a little restraint might be wise.
  We all love these additions – “a really interesting mix of flavours and
  textures”, Claire observes – but I’ve left them as optional extras, because I
  do feel that in a pasta con pomodoro crudo the tomatoes should be the star
  attraction. (The same goes for Maccioni’s mozzarella, which, delicious as it
  is, makes some of us feel as if we’re eating an M&amp;S pasta salad on a
  train.) Herb wise, basil is the most popular choice, and the clear favourite;
  Leigh’s mint, meanwhile, gets mixed reviews. No one can detect Hazan’s
  marjoram or parsley, and fennel seeds divide opinion; we all agree we love
  them in other dishes, but here, as Anna says, they overpower the tomato.
  Davies’ optional chilli flakes prove more of a crowdpleaser, but, again,
  they’re very much gilding the lily. Garlic, however, is another must, though
  the quantity is up to you. It’s not cooked, so I’ve been quite restrained, but
  you may prefer a punchier, fierier result. The toppings “No cheese is
  necessary with this sauce,” Del Conte says sternly in her brilliant collection
  On Pasta. Rossetto Kasper disagrees, and her salty pecorino gets many
  compliments – not least because, well, who doesn’t love cheese? That said,
  Leigh’s wonderful savoury, crunchy anchovy pangrattato, or crisp flavoured
  breadcrumbs, also have their fans – “these smell really good”, Victoria says
  happily. Though they’re certainly not foundational, I do like the contrast in
  texture, as well as the fact that they’re easily veganised (simply omit the
  anchovy for a fully plant-based dish). Serving Though this isn’t a pasta
  salad, I’m reliably informed that pasta con pomodoro crudo can be served warm
  or at room temperature – but “never chilled”, Rossetto Kasper counsels, as if
  the very idea of cold pasta wasn’t enough to warn you off in itself. This
  makes it an utterly brilliant dish for a summer evening: make ahead, enjoy
  yourself, then casually toss into bowls with a sprinkling of basil when it’s
  time to eat. The Italians know a thing or two about warm weather dining, it
  turns out. Perfect fresh tomato pasta Prep 15 min Cook 12 min Steep 30 min
  Serves 4 800g ripe but firm tomatoes, preferably, but not necessarily, plum 2
  tbsp red-wine vinegar ¾ tbsp flaky salt, plus extra for cooking the pasta 4
  tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra if making pangrattato 2-3 plump
  garlic cloves, peeled 4 tbsp dry breadcrumbs (optional) 1 tinned anchovy
  fillet, drained (optional) 400g spaghetti, or spaghettini 1 small bunch fresh
  basil Optional extras 60g olives, black, green or a mixture, stoned and
  chopped 1 tbsp capers (rinsed if packed in salt), chopped 4 anchovy fillets
  (rinsed if packed in salt), chopped ½ tsp chilli flakes Cut the tomatoes into
  fairly small dice (this is much easier if you have a sharp knife) and put them
  and all their juices in a bowl with the vinegar, half the salt and all the
  oil. Mash the garlic to a paste with the remaining salt, then stir that into
  the tomato bowl, too, along with any of the optional extras. Leave to sit for
  at least 30 minutes, though longer won’t hurt (but don’t leave it so long that
  it requires refrigeration). If making the pangrattato, put a tablespoon of oil
  in a small frying pan over a medium heat, then mash in the anchovy, if using,
  until dissolved. Turn up the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and fry until crisp
  and golden. Season if not using the anchovy, then set aside. Cook the pasta in
  plenty of salted water until just shy of the recommended cooking time.
  Meanwhile, drain the tomato mix, reserving the juices. Drain the pasta. Pour
  the reserved tomato juices into the empty pan, set it over a medium heat, then
  return the cooked pasta to the pan and toss until it has absorbed the juice.
  Turn off the heat, tip in the tomatoes and toss well. If serving immediately,
  scatter over the pangrattato and tear in the basil; if serving at room
  temperature, do so just before serving. Pasta con pomodoro crudo – is it a
  primo or a salad? Which pasta do you favour? And what’s your top tip for
  bringing out the best in the tomatoes?
