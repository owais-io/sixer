  Two brothers, two classic albums and a reunion fans have been waiting for
  since 2009 … sound familiar? But while Oasis took to the stage with their lens
  firmly fixed on the past, Clipse came back this year with a return-to-form
  record: fourth album Let God Sort Em Out met the wild anticipation, restating
  Pusha T and Malice’s lyrical skill, pushing starry guests to step up, and
  bringing the best out of producer Pharrell Williams. Next week, the Thornton
  brothers will sit for the Guardian Film &amp; Music reader interview. You
  could ask them about how they fell apart and came back together; how rap has
  changed since they’ve been away; how the new album is a tribute to their late
  parents; the state of the Virginia and southern rap scenes today – or anything
  else you like. Post your questions in the comments by noon BST on 6 August and
  the best will appear in a future issue of Film &amp; Music.
