  Times may be tough on the high street but the bookseller Waterstones is
  enjoying strong sales as younger adults embrace reading as an escape from
  their screens and as online competition eases. “People have come back to
  reading and buying books in bookshops as we have made a place which is an
  enjoyable and effective way to buy books,” says James Daunt, the CEO of the
  British retailer, which has 320 UK bookshops and owns the Foyles, Hatchards
  and Blackwell’s names, and whose parent group also owns Barnes &amp; Noble,
  the US’s largest bookstore chain. Daunt says Waterstones’s sales revenues are
  up 5%, about half of which is down to higher prices. The rest is a result of
  selling “lots and lots of books” as, he says, younger adults are being
  inspired to pick up a paperback by social media, such as the trend for TikTok
  recommendations known as BookTok, and book clubs in real life. “They want to
  do something not staring at a screen and relatively inexpensive, and once
  people start collecting books they just buy more,” Daunt says. “BookTok is an
  easy label to put on it, but this is about people wanting to read and talk
  about books.” He says that while some trends in reading can be quite local,
  there have been waves of interest in subjects from romance to romantasy to
  fantasy that have caught the public’s imagination. Waterstones’s figures
  indicate that a boom in UK sales of fiction last year – with sales up 12.2%,
  according to the Publishers Association – has continued into 2025, despite
  concerns about a squeeze on household budgets. The fiction rise offset a 2.8%
  fall in sales of children’s books and a decline in nonfiction sales that meant
  the UK print book market as a whole, which makes up about 80% of sales, shrank
  1%, while digital sales rose 17%. Daunt says bookshops continue to benefit
  from parents bringing in their children to enthuse them about reading, and
  Waterstones has made efforts to improve the attractiveness of its stores as
  places to go, with cafes, and books reviewed and picked out by local staff.
  The company is opening 10 new stores a year in the UK. It is considering new
  kinds of locations, from inside department stores to parts of the country
  where it is less well known, such as Northern Ireland and Scotland. It
  announced plans last week to open two more outlets in John Lewis department
  stores – in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, and Bluewater, Kent – after the
  success of its branch at the chain’s flagship site on Oxford Street in London.
  Those outlets are in addition to five in Next stores as the company tries to
  find locations that are convenient for shoppers. The business, which was
  bought by the hedge fund Elliott Advisors in 2018, is also benefiting from the
  demise of some key rivals, such as the closure of the Irish retailer Eason in
  Northern Ireland and difficulties at WH Smith, which is now concentrated in
  travel locations such as railway stations and airports after selling off its
  high street arm, which is being renamed TGJones. Daunt says Waterstones has
  been keen to hold on to its shops, even in less affluent areas where other
  national retailers have exited – such as Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, which
  is now seeing a resurgence thanks to new orders for the local employer BAE
  Systems. “If you stay in these places the pendulum does swing back,” he says.
  He says growth is stronger in the US than in the UK because the demise of
  bookshops there “has been more savage”. The Barnes &amp; Noble chain, also
  owned by Elliott and where Daunt is also the CEO, is benefiting in the US –
  where it is planning 60 new stores a year – from building on experience with
  Waterstones to open “much, much better bookshops” and training up and
  empowering its booksellers, he says.
