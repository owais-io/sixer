  Former United States President Joe Biden took the stage at the National Bar
  Association’s 100th Annual Awards Gala in Chicago to deliver remarks honoring
  the United States civil rights legacy, and the state of the country. Speaking
  amid continual scrutiny around his physical and mental health, Biden played up
  the importance of a strong judicial branch, and characterized the US as at a
  moment in time that “makes us confront hard truths.” “So many of you have
  fought to make this country live up to its highest ideals,” Biden said. “Not
  since the tumultuous days of the 1960s has this fight been so existential to
  who we are as a nation, with marginalized groups so dramatically under
  attack.” Founded in 1925, the National Bar Association is the largest and
  oldest network of law professors, judges, and lawyers in the US. Biden’s
  speech focused heavily on the contributions of Black lawyers to America’s
  civil rights history, and the need to continue that legacy, in light of an
  administration that he said “seeks to erase history, erase quality, erase
  justice itself. “We see the apparent glee of some of our politicians while
  watching immigrants who are in this country legally torn from the arms of
  their family, dragged away in handcuffs from the only home they’ve ever
  known,” Biden said. “My friends, we need to face the hard truths of this
  administration.” Law firms representing those opposing the Trump
  administration’s agenda have been targeted with executive orders by the
  administration. Some have capitulated to the tune of tens of millions of
  dollars. Federal judges, increasingly on the receiving end of harsh rhetoric
  and threats to their safety, have weighed creating their own security forces.
  “We see the law firms, bowing to pressure, bending to bullies, instead of
  staying rooted in justice of the law,” Biden said. The gala is not the first
  speaking engagement of the summer that Biden has used to take aim at current
  US President Donald Trump. In June, he offered oblique criticism of the Trump
  administration during a Juneteenth celebration service at the Reedy Chapel AME
  Church, one of the places in Texas where an order proclaiming the end of
  slavery was read on 19 June 1865. Earlier this month, Biden delivered a
  keynote address at the Society for Human Resource Management conference in San
  Diego. During a question and answer session, Biden said he was “working like
  hell” to finish a memoir of his presidency as he contends with his prostate
  cancer diagnosis. In his book, a reflection of the 46th president’s four years
  in office, Biden will probably attempt to shape his legacy – and to confront
  questions about his mental health and physical fitness that clouded his final
  years in office and ultimately forced to end his bid for re-election. While
  Biden heaped praise on former vice-president Kamala Harris during his speech,
  he did not reference his decision to step down mid-election. In sporadic
  public appearances since leaving the White House, Biden has hit back against
  new reporting that alleges a “cover up” by the then-president’s closest aides
  to hide his frailty and decline from an American public who polls showed
  believed he was too old to serve another four years. Biden’s speech did not
  directly address these allegations, although he did note his two of his claims
  to fame in US politics – being the youngest person ever elected to the US
  Senate, and the oldest person elected to the presidency. The White House and
  congressional Republicans have amplified the claims, opening investigations
  into whether Biden was in control when he made a series of notable clemency
  decisions at the end of his presidency. In an interview with the New York
  Times this month, Biden said he orally authorized every pardon and commutation
  issued during his term and called Republicans who said his staff abused the
  presidential autopen “liars”. Hours before Biden spoke, Mike Donilon, one of
  the former president’s top advisers and longest-serving aides, gave a
  closed-door interview to the House Oversight Committee as part of the
  Republican-led panel’s investigation into Biden’s cognitive decline. On
  Wednesday, Steve Ricchetti, another top adviser to the former president, also
  appeared before the committee.
