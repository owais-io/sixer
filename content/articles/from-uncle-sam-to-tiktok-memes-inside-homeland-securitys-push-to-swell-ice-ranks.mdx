  The pinned post on the X account of the US Department of Homeland Security
  (DHS) is an image of Uncle Sam with the caption “We Need You.” “America has
  been invaded by criminals and predators,” the post reads. “We need YOU to get
  them out.” DHS posts on Instagram are similar. One pinned post features a
  highly produced video that starts with a family walking in a field and urges
  viewers to “defend” their “homeland”. Another displays an image of a younger
  and older man in military garb, designed to look like a first world war-era
  army recruitment poster. Under it, in big bold capital letters: “NO AGE CAP
  JOIN ICE NOW”. The caption: “We’re taking father/son bonding to a whole new
  level.” The posts are part of the DHS’s push to quickly hire more than 10,000
  new US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers and 3,000 border
  patrol agents in order to meet the Trump administration’s aggressive arrest
  and deportation quotas. To meet those goals, the DHS has made several changes
  to its job and eligibility requirements in what experts say is a rushed
  attempt to expand its hiring pool – including appealing to a younger set of
  potential recruits. In addition to lowering the age minimum to 18, DHS is
  working to incentivize more hires with promises of forgiving up to $60,000 in
  college loans. And it has heavily invested in advertising on social media. In
  early August, 404 Media spotted Ice documents that solicited pitches from
  advertising companies that could help the agency “dominate digital media with
  messages that reflect the urgency and scale of Ice’s hiring effort”. Ice
  identified three audiences as its targets: former military and law
  enforcement; legal professionals; gen Z and early-career professionals. The
  deadline for companies to submit proposals was 11 August. It is unclear
  whether Ice has selected a vendor, though there have been no new posted
  contracts as of yet and Meta’s ad library, which is one of the few public
  repositories of brand advertising activity on social media, has no new entries
  for the DHS or Ice as of the publication of this article. Meanwhile, Ice and
  the DHS have already been ramping up their social media recruitment efforts on
  various platforms. Its photos and videos depict the US at war, with Ice and
  border patrol agents part of a heroic effort to save the country from
  criminals and predators, even though numerous studies have shown immigrants
  commit fewer crimes than those born in the US. Many of the ads conjure a
  feeling of nostalgia for a country that once was. And some have thinly veiled
  references to white supremacist messages. Marketing experts say that taken
  together, the various posts show a scattered strategy, probably because the
  agency is targeting such a wide array of audiences. The posts depict a country
  that the younger generation has never known, says Mara Einstein, the author of
  Hoodwinked, How Marketers Use the Same Tactics as Cults. “This is a generation
  that has lived through permacrisis and has never known that shiny city on the
  hill that people of older generations think of when they think of the US,”
  Einstein said. “Even if you have a dual target, advertisers have to ask how do
  you talk to both of these people.” Many of the ads juxtapose Uncle Sam and
  other American symbols with images of mostly brown immigrants being arrested.
  On X, DHS regularly posts intentionally antagonistic memes commonly used in
  far-right corners of the internet in its responses to other people’s posts.
  The overall campaign strategy also appears to attempt to replicate in some
  ways the US army’s “Be All You Can Be” campaign – likening the recruitment of
  immigration enforcement officers to a military recruitment campaign and an act
  of patriotism, experts say. One video shows supposed immigration officers
  training in a military facility and people jumping out of planes. The caption:
  “Hunt cartels. Save America.” In its latest video the DHS boasts about its
  5,000th arrest in Los Angeles that starts with Hollywood-style footage of
  immigration officers putting on their military tactical gear and ends with a
  compilation of mostly brown men being arrested or detained. “The targeting of
  Black and brown immigrants with false information and using pictures of Uncle
  Sam as if this is military recruitment at the time of war is an unprecedented
  use of propaganda for civil immigration enforcement,” said Nayna Gupta, the
  policy director at the American Immigration Council. “The social media
  messaging links this anti-immigration narrative to patriotism to some
  all-American identity,” Gupta continued. “But part of the American identity
  has always been this is a country that welcomes people that want to build
  something better.” While the messaging is muddled, the choice to post images
  or text that either enrage or excite an already polarized audience is a
  strategy that builds on Donald Trump’s ongoing success with capturing
  attention on social media by posting hateful and inflammatory content,
  according to Ramesh Srinivasan, aUCLA professor of information studies. “It’s
  a messaging strategy that has worked well within algorithmic systems that are
  optimized for content that is predicted to capture attention,” Srinivasan
  said. “It’s a negative populism that has been part of the Trump team’s
  strategy from the get-go.” The campaign also seeks to put a glossy sheen on
  the realities of working for Ice – making it look like a scene out of Bad Boys
  while simultaneously demonizing and dehumanizing America’s immigrant
  communities, experts say. It’s not a totally unprecedented approach to
  recruitment for the DHS to take but it’s historically been a far cry from the
  realities of working for Ice, according to Michelle Brané, a former DHS
  official under the Biden administration. “The recruitment videos have always
  looked like an episode of Cops, so these new videos are not necessarily that
  different,” Brane said. “It was always about: ‘We’re going to catch the bad
  guys,’ with videos of raiding a house, a car chase, wrestling someone to the
  ground. And that always seemed problematic. “Many people in the field were
  very dissatisfied with the day-to-day of their jobs,” Brané said of her time
  working at the DHS. “They did arrest criminals, but a very large part of their
  job is just processing regular people who have immigration violations or who
  crossed the border and are requesting asylum. But they’d insist, ‘That’s not
  the job I signed up for – I signed up to catch the bad guys.’” Experts worry
  that the rapid pace of recruitment, paired with the polarizing messaging the
  DHS is using will attract a group of people desperate for work who may share
  the xenophobic and anti-immigrant stances of the administration. “This feels
  like a multi-level marketing thing where you’re going to get the people who
  are really vulnerable and desperate and looking for some type of job who is
  willing to do this,” said Einstein. It may further push Ice, as an agency,
  into an extreme political posture, Gupta said. “What’s worrisome is that any
  folks that this kind of dehumanizing propaganda would work on are more likely
  to share xenophobic views of non-citizens,” Gupta said. “Combined with
  decreasing training and vetting practices by Ice as they look to speed up
  hiring creates a situation where the agency is likely to be hiring enforcement
  officers who have an explicit history of racism or don’t meet the usual
  standards of law enforcement officers.”
