  Wildfires raging in northern California wine country and central Oregon have
  destroyed multiple homes and threatened thousands more as hot, dry weather
  created challenges for firefighters battles the blazes. Ten structures –
  including four homes – have been destroyed in Oregon’s Deschutes County as of
  Monday, where a wildfire dubbed the Flat fire continues to burn. “We are
  deeply saddened by the loss of homes and personal property and extend our
  sympathy to those affected,” said the Deschutes county sheriff Ty Rupert in a
  Facebook post, who also thanked firefighters for saving “hundreds of homes”.
  About 4,000 homes in the area remain under evacuation notices. Meanwhile in
  northern California’s Napa county, a wildfire dubbed the Pickett fire has
  charred more than 6,800 acres since breaking out late last week in remote
  territory amid a searing heatwave. The fire is burning in an area that is well
  known for its wineries and hot springs, and is threatening about 500
  structures. About 150 people were ordered to leave their homes, while another
  360 were under evacuation warnings near Aetna Springs and Pope Valley, located
  80 miles (130km) north of San Francisco, according to Cal Fire spokesperson
  Jason Clay. The Pickett fire is now 13% contained, and more than 1,230
  firefighters have been dispatched to the scene, backed by 10 helicopters. The
  cause of the fire is under investigation. “The fire is currently holding
  within its current footprint at 6,803 acres (2,753 hectares),” spokesperson
  Curtis Rhodes told the Associated Press on Monday morning. “With the weather
  over the last 48 hours, we’re seeing high temperatures, low humidity paired
  with some increasing wind in the late afternoon, which was giving our troops
  some additional work on the eastern side of this incident.” Firefighting
  equipment has been put in place to protect vineyards, he added. Wine
  production “is a driving force here in the community as far as income and
  revenue”, Rhodes said. Flames spared the home and adjacent vineyards of Jayson
  Woodbridge of Hundred Acre wines, but he said it was a close call on Thursday
  when the fire broke out and raced along nearby slopes. He and his son grabbed
  hoses and futilely began spraying down the steep hillsides. “The water was
  evaporating as fast as we were spraying it out there,” Woodbridge recalled on
  Monday. “It was just a hot funnel of air. Fire was just engulfing everything.”
  Before long, crews with bulldozers and air support arrived to protect the
  property. Water-dropping helicopters continued their flights on Monday,
  keeping the flames contained to remote canyons about 80 miles (130km) north of
  San Francisco. With about a month to go before harvest, Woodbridge said his
  grapes won’t be damaged because of the “pure luck” of wind direction. “The
  smoke won’t affect the fruit because the wind’s coming in from the west,
  thankfully,” Woodbridge said. That wasn’t the case in 2020 when toxic smoke
  from an enormous wildfire called the Glass fire caused Woodbridge and other
  wineries to scrap much of that year’s crop. There have been no reports of
  damage to any vineyards from the Pickett fire, said Michelle Novi with Napa
  Valley Vintners, a non-profit trade association. Hot weather heightens fire
  risk Residents of the western United States have been sweltering in a heatwave
  that hospitalized some people, with temperatures hitting dangerous levels
  throughout the weekend in Washington, Oregon, southern California, Nevada and
  Arizona. Even after the heatwave subsides, the risks will remain. With minimal
  moisture in areas of California and the Pacific north-west, fire dangers are
  expected to climb through the next month and into October. Vegetation is
  dangerously dry and overgrown in parts of Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona,
  Colorado and Wyoming. The intense summer conditions have sparked multiple
  wildfires across the US west in recent weeks. In southwest Montana, a
  firefighter died on Sunday afternoon after suffering a cardiac emergency while
  battling a blaze dubbed the Bivens Creek fire, which is burning in a remote
  area with thick timber and numerous dead trees. The man, who was not
  immediately identified, was among more than 700 firefighters working on the
  lightning-caused fire in the Tobacco Root Mountains about 15 miles (24km)
  north of Virginia City, Montana. The Pickett fire began in the same area as
  the much larger Glass fire, which crossed into Sonoma county and eventually
  burned about 105 square miles (272 sq km) and more than 1,500 structures. The
  2020 blaze was driven by wind, while the current conflagration is fueled
  mainly by dry vegetation on steep slopes – some of it dead and downed trees
  left over from the Glass fire and some of it grass and brush that grew back
  and then dried out again, said Clay. Clay said the weather has moderated since
  the California fire began, with Sunday’s high at about 94F (34C). But humidity
  levels were expected to drop with increasing winds later in the day. “That’s
  been a driving factor in the afternoons since we’ve seen the fire activity
  pick up for the last three days,” Clay said, adding that “support from all up
  and down California has been critical to our efforts.” The area of the Oregon
  fire is in a high desert climate, where dried grasses and juniper trees are
  burning and fire is racing through canyon areas where it is challenging to
  create containment lines, said Jason Carr, Deschutes county sheriff’s
  spokesperson. The fire began on Thursday night and grew quickly amid hot,
  gusty conditions. Fire officials were keeping an eye on isolated thunderstorms
  in southern Oregon that could drift north on Sunday, a state fire marshals
  spokesperson, Chris Schimmer, said in a video posted to Facebook. “If we get
  thunderstorms that roll through, it can … cause the fire to jump [containment]
  lines,” said Carr, adding the downdrafts can push fire in multiple directions.
  Although it’s difficult to directly tie a single fire or weather event
  directly to climate change, scientists say human-caused warming from burning
  fossil fuels like coal and gas is causing more intense heatwaves and droughts,
  which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires.
