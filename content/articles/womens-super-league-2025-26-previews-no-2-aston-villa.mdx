  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie
  Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 6th Prospects Aston Villa will be aiming for a smoother Women’s
  Super League season, having spent much of the 2024-25 campaign flirting with
  relegation. There were strong signs, however, that the club had put the
  problems of Robert de Pauw’s tenure behind them with a comfortable sixth-place
  finish. An eye-catching final run saw them unbeaten in five games, scoring 16
  in the process, including five against Arsenal. The four months under De Pauw
  had proved an unmitigated disaster and left Natalia Arroyo with a mountain to
  climb when she joined the club in January. Once safety had been secured, the
  Spaniard’s coaching principles started to shine and the team visibly grew in
  confidence. But with an ageing squad, there was always going to be some
  turnover and the departures of Jordan Nobbs, Danielle Turner and Rachel Corsie
  point to this fact. It was important for Arroyo to maintain a strong spine and
  Rachel Daly’s contract extension points to how valued her leadership and
  experience remains, while managing to keep Anna Patten, Kirsty Hanson and Lucy
  Parker indicates that Villa remains attractive for high-quality
  internationals. Arroyo has injected youth into her squad over the summer with
  the signings of Ellie Roebuck (25), Lynn Wilms (24), Océane Deslandes (25) and
  England Under-23 international Lucia Kendall, while bringing in Jill Baijings
  permanently from Bayern Munich was a notable coup. The Netherlands midfielder
  made a significant impact on loan last season, wearing the captain’s armband
  in the absence of Daly on several occasions. Villa have been building momentum
  in pre-season. A 2-0 defeat at Manchester United was followed by a 5-1 win
  over Liverpool and an impressive 1-1 draw away to Paris Saint-Germain. With a
  final friendy to come against Union Berlin, Arroyo’s side are looking to be in
  strong shape for theiropening match away at Brighton. The manager Arroyo was
  probably not on many people’s radars when she signed a three-and-a-half year
  deal in January, but the 39-year-old has already proved to be one of Europe’s
  most promising coaches. After being forced to retire from playing through
  injury, Arroyo began her management career with Catalonia before joining Real
  Sociedad in 2020. Her four-year tenure at the club saw them finish runners-up
  in Liga F in the 2021-22 season. Arroyo likes her teams to be aggressive in
  the press and direct going forward, using the pace and energy of the likes of
  Hanson, Chasity Grant and Ebony Salmon to break defensive lines. Off-field
  picture Aston Villa became the latest club to offload their women’s team to
  help them avoid any breaches of the Premier League’s profitability and
  sustainability regulations. The deal saw a 90% stake in the women’s side sold
  to Villa’s parent company V Sports, which was founded by owners Wes Edens and
  Nassef Sawiris. A 10% stake was sold to external American investors. It
  follows Chelsea’s decision to do similar last year when the women’s arm of the
  club was sold to BlueCo for around £200m. Star signing Lynn Wilms became the
  club’s first marquee signing of the summer, arriving after four seasons at
  Wolfsburg. The versatile Netherlands international can play at centre-back and
  right-back and brings plenty of Champions League experience. During her time
  in Germany, the 24-year-old made more than 100 appearances in all competitions
  for Wolfsburg, lifting the Frauen-Bundesliga title in 2021-2022 and picking up
  a Champions League runners-up medal in 2023. Wilms made her debut for the
  Netherlands at 18 and has featured in four major tournaments, including Euro
  2025. Stepping up Rachel Maltby is one of the most promising young players to
  have emerged from Aston Villa’s academy in recent years, and it has been an
  exciting 12 months for the 18-year-old defender. After finishing fourth with
  England at the under-17 World Cup last year, she signed her first professional
  deal with the club in March. Maltby proceeded to make her WSL debut at Villa
  Park in their 5-2 victory over Arsenal, coming on as a second-half substitute
  for Maz Pacheco. A dynamic player, she can play at full-back and wing-back on
  either side of the pitch and possesses plenty of attacking qualities. It was a
  good summer for … Noelle Maritz was an integral part of Switzerland’s historic
  run at this summer’s European Championship. Ever-present at the heart of Pia
  Sundhage’s defence, she helped the hosts reach the quarter-finals. Switzerland
  were defeated by Spain but there is no doubt the impact Maritz and her
  teammates had on a nation. From fan marches lining the cities of Switzerland
  to the vociferous support inside the stadiums, it will have been an experience
  Martiz will remember for ever. Main initiative to attract more fans The
  clubmoved all their home games to Villa Park last season and they will be
  looking to build on that, as well as the matchday experience, this year. Villa
  have been working hard to turn each fixture into an event with pre-match
  entertainment for all ages, including live music, foot pool, selfie pods and
  prize draw opportunities at every home game. There are also group-booking
  initiatives in place for grassroot clubs and education establishments.
