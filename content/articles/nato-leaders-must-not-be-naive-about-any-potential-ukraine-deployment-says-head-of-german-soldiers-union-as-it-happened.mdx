  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! Russia’s foreign minister warned that Moscow
  must have an effective veto over any measures to support Ukraine once a peace
  deal is reached, undermining western plans to provide Kyiv with security
  guarantees (12:30, 13:18). The report comes as Russian sources claimed that
  Russia would demand that Ukraine give up all of the eastern Donbas region,
  renounce ambitions to join Nato, remain neutral and keep western troops out of
  the country as part of any peace talks, Reuters reported (17:10). Military
  chiefs from the US and the European countries have developed new proposals on
  security guarantees for Ukraine and will present them to their respective
  national security advisers, a US official said, drawing on the last
  behind-the-scenes conversations on this issue (16:26). Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would want to see an agreement on security
  guarantees for Ukraine before meeting Russia’s Vladimir Putin, in the next
  7-10 days (10:10, 11:50, 12:14). European Nato leaders must not be naive when
  discussing a Ukraine peace force but face up to the reality that they would
  need to deploy tens of thousands of troops to the country for the long term,
  the head of Germany’s soldiers’ union said (15:54). Elsewhere, Polish
  authorities have said that an alleged Russian drone that crossed into Poland
  and exploded in rural eastern part of the country came with “very high
  probability” from Belarus (11:15). Italian police have arrested a Ukrainian
  man suspected of coordinating the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines,
  Germany’s prosecutor general said, adding that he would be brought before a
  German judge after being transferred, Reuters reported (12:36). In other news,
  The EU and the US have now agreed on the much-awaited “joint statement”
  advancing the political commitments on trade agreed by Ursula von der Leyen
  and Donald Trump in Scotland last month (13:09). EU’s trade commissioner Maroš
  Šefčovič argued that “this framework is the first step, one that can grow over
  time to cover more sectors,” as he warned that the alternative of a “trade war
  with sky high tariffs” would have been highly damaging (13:22). The deal
  includes some reassurances for EU carmakers (13:25), but not wine and
  spiritmakers (13:41), despite heavy lobbying. And that’s all from me, Jakub
  Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at
  jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social
  and on X at @jakubkrupa. Vladimir Putin is demanding that Ukraine give up all
  of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join Nato, remain neutral
  and keep western troops out of the country, three sources familiar with
  top-level Kremlin thinking told Reuters. Reuters claimed it was able to
  outline the contours of what the Kremlin would like to see in a possible peace
  deal to end a war that has killed and injured hundreds of thousands of people.
  In essence, the Russian sources told Reuters, Putin has compromised on
  territorial demands he laid out in June 2024, which required Kyiv to cede the
  entirety of the four provinces Moscow claims as part of Russia: Dontesk and
  Luhansk in eastern Ukraine - which make up the Donbas – plus Kherson and
  Zaporizhzhia in the south. Kyiv rejected those terms as tantamount to
  surrender. In his new proposal, the Russian president has stuck to his demand
  that Ukraine completely withdraw from the parts of the Donbas it still
  controls, according to the three sources. In return, though, Moscow would halt
  the current front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, they added. Moscow is
  also willing to hand over the small parts of the Kharkiv, Sumy, and
  Dnipropetrovsk regions of Ukraine it controls as part of a possible deal, the
  sources that Reuters spoke with said. The agency said that Putin is sticking,
  too, to his previous demands that Ukraine give up its Nato ambitions and for a
  legally binding pledge from the military alliance that it will not expand
  further eastwards, as well as for limits on the Ukrainian army and an
  agreement that no western troops will be deployed on the ground in Ukraine as
  part of a peacekeeping force, the sources said. On this point, we also got an
  update from numerous meetings in the latest few days exploring what are the
  options for the US and a number of European countries in terms of military
  assistance and support for Ukraine in case of a ceasefire or a permanent peace
  settlement. Military chiefs from the US and the European countries have
  developed new proposals and will present them to their respective national
  security advisers, a US official told Reuters, drawing on the last
  behind-the-scenes conversations on this issue. “These options will be
  presented to each nation’s respective national security advisers for
  appropriate consideration in ongoing diplomatic efforts,” the official said.
  The meetings were attended by the chief of defence from Finland, France,
  Germany, Italy, the UK, Ukraine, and the US. Reuters noted that the officials
  have cautioned that it would take time for US and European planners to
  determine what would be both militarily feasible and acceptable to the
  Kremlin, a point further highlighted by Russian foreign minister Lavrov’s
  hardline comments earlier today (13:18). European Nato leaders must not be
  naive when discussing a Ukraine peace force but face up to the reality that
  they would need to deploy tens of thousands of troops to the country for the
  long term, the head of Germany’s soldiers’ union said. In comments reported by
  Reuters, Col Andre Wuestner, head of the German Armed Forces Association,
  called on European leaders not to play down the military task. “It won’t be
  enough to have a handful of generals and smaller military units man a command
  post in Ukraine,” Wuestner, whose organisation represents more than 200,000
  active and retired soldiers, told Reuters. “From the very beginning, it must
  be made clear to Putin – and backed by international forces – that we are
  totally serious about security guarantees”, he said. Wuestner estimated that
  each of the big countries in the coalition of the willing, such as Britain,
  France and Germany, would need to deploy at least 10,000 troops to Ukraine for
  the long run, posing a huge challenge to their already stretched and
  under-equipped forces. in Kharkiv, Kherson and Sloviansk It was one of the
  most horrifying targets of Russia’s war on Ukraine so far. Reports showed a
  pregnant woman on a stretcher, her face ashen with shock, legs smeared with
  blood and a hand holding her bump. Behind her, the bombed-out ruins of
  Mariupol’s maternity hospital. More than a dozen people, including women in
  labour, were injured in the attack in March 2022. The woman photographed,
  Iryna Kalinina, later died along with her unborn baby. In the three years
  since then, maternity care in Ukraine has remained under constant attack, with
  more than 2,000 strikes on medical facilities, including 81 affecting maternal
  care and delivery rooms. Just last month, Diana Koshyk, seven months pregnant,
  was killed when a missile struck a maternity hospital in the eastern
  Dnipropetrovsk region. Over the past month, the Guardian has visited three
  maternity hospitals on the frontline to witness how Russia’s full-scale
  invasion and attacks on healthcare facilities have taken away women’s
  fundamental right to a safe childbirth. in Washington Donald Trump intends to
  leave Russia and Ukraine to organise a meeting between their leaders without
  directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials
  familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in
  Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian
  president, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, the officials
  said. Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a
  trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first,
  although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump
  does not intend to become involved in that effort. In a phone interview with
  talkshow host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it
  would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first
  instance. “I just want to see what happens at the meeting. So they’re in the
  process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.” Trump’s
  reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has
  acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more
  difficult than he had anticipated, after saying on the campaign trail last
  year he could achieve it in 24 hours. Šefčovič is still speaking, confirming
  among others that the digital sector was kept out of the current trade talks
  with the US, among others. But in a blow to EU winemakers and spirit
  producers, he says the bloc could not secure a deal in this area, despite
  lobbying from Europe’s greatest winemakers in France, Italy, Germany, Spain
  and Portugal. He says: “The tariffs on the wine, spirits and beer was one of
  very important offensive interests of the European Union. Unfortunately here,
  we didn’t succeed to get this sector and this category among the sectors which
  would continue to be on the MFN [Most Favoured Nation] level. I just would
  like to add one very important word, and this is: yet. Because our US
  colleagues, they know that this is our offensive interests, that’s something
  which is very important for us. And therefore I would also refer you to the
  paragraph which is very important for us, which says that both parties, the
  United States and the EU, are ready to look at other sectors where we could
  lower these tariffs in the future.” Importantly for EU’s carmakers, Šefčovič
  says that the bloc was pushing to get new 15% tariff applied retroactively
  back to 1 August. “I believe this is welcome news for our car industry, which
  was bleeding a lot of cash over the last few months,” he says, saying it
  weighed on the negotiators’ minds. He said the EU was looking to present
  necessary legislative proposal this month. Back to Brussels, EU trade
  commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is speaking now on the EU-US trade arrangements.
  He reiterates the point made by von der Leyen in the press statement that the
  joint statement “this is not the end, it’s the beginning.” “This framework is
  the first step, one that can grow over time to cover more sectors, improve
  market access and strengthen our economic ties even further, this work has
  been intense and essential,” he says. He stresses the importance of the
  arrangement, saying: “This carries considerable weight and is truly impactful
  at the time when the trade landscape has completely changed. Our transatlantic
  relationship is one of the largest economic partnerships in the world, and
  this agreement has a clear common goal, to put it on solid ground and help
  drive free industrialization on both sides of the Atlantic, and we want to
  fully unleash the potential of our combined economic power.” Similarly to his
  comments in the past, he also says that the alternative to this, however
  imperfect, deal was much worse. “The alternative, a trade war with sky high
  tariffs and political escalation, helps no one. It hurts jobs. It hurts
  growth, and it damages businesses across both the EU and the US. And this is
  not theoretical as nearly 5 million European jobs, including many in SMEs
  would be at risk. This deal avoids that path.” Russia’s foreign minister
  warned that Moscow must have an effective veto over any measures to support
  Ukraine once a peace deal is reached, undermining western plans to provide
  Kyiv with security guarantees. In a series of hardline remarks (12:30), Sergei
  Lavrov said European proposals to deploy troops in Ukraine after a settlement
  would amount to “foreign intervention,” which he called absolutely
  unacceptable for Russia. He also poured cold water on the prospect of a
  Putin–Zelenskyy summit touted by Donald Trump, saying a bilateral meeting at
  the highest level would only be possible “if all issues requiring discussion
  are thoroughly prepared.” Russia’s veteran foreign minister further questioned
  whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy had the legitimacy to sign any future peace
  accord, parroting a familiar Kremlin line that portrays Ukraine’s leadership
  as illegitimate. Lavrov’s remarks cast doubt on the prospects for peace talks,
  suggesting that Russia is retreating from the understandings reached in Alaska
  – where Trump claimed Vladimir Putin had accepted western security guarantees
  for Ukraine – or that the US administration may have misinterpreted the
  Kremlin’s position from the outset. It’s worth remembering that the joint
  statement is still technically not legally binding on the parties, but is a
  “blueprint” or a “road map” that further spells out and advances their
  political commitments on the EU-US trade, progressing the talks in Turnberry.
  We should hear more about the deal from the EU’s trade commissioner Maroš
  Šefčovič, who is expected to be up at the European Commission shortly. I will
  bring you the key lines here. We have just heard from the European Commission,
  confirming that the EU and the US have now agreed on the much-awaited “joint
  statement” advancing the political commitments on trade agreed by Ursula von
  der Leyen and Donald Trump in Scotland last month. The commission’s press
  release says the statement “lays out in detail the new US tariff regime
  towards the EU, with a clear maximum, all-inclusive, tariff rate of 15% for
  the vast majority of EU exports, including strategic sectors such as cars,
  pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber.” “Sectors which are already
  subject to Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs of 15% or above, will not be
  subject to additional tariffs,” it added. It also said that “with regard to
  cars and car parts, the 15% US tariff ceiling will apply in tandem with the EU
  initiating the procedures for tariff reductions vis-a-vis US products.”
  Separately, a senior US official told Reuters that tariff relief for EU
  carmakers were expected to come in “hopefully weeks.” The text of the joint
  statement also confirms the EU’s commitment to “procure US liquified natural
  gas, oil and nuclear energy products” valued at $750bn through 2028, with
  another $40bn expected to be spent on US AI chips for computing centres. Von
  der Leyen welcomed the publication, saying that “faced with a challenging
  situation, we have delivered for our Member States and industry, and restored
  clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade.” She also hinted that the EU
  would continue working “to agree more tariff reductions, to identify more
  areas of cooperation, and to create more economic growth potential.” in Berlin
  Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, has had to row back on comments
  he made earlier this week, in which he suggested that Germany’s military would
  be too overstretched if it had to send troops to Ukraine. Wadepfuhl said in an
  interview that the Bundeswehr was already contributing troops to a
  combat-ready brigade in Lithuania. “Doing that and also stationing troops in
  Ukraine would probably overstretch us,” he said. The discussion over troops in
  Ukraine concerns finding a security guarantee for Ukraine if and when Moscow
  ceased its war on the country. One suggestion has been for Nato members to
  station troops in the country, even as Moscow has said it’ll not accept such
  an arrangement. Wadephul made the remarks ahead of the key meeting in
  Washington between Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelenskyy, US president Donald
  Trump, and a number of their European counterparts. Wadepfuhl, who is on a
  trade trip to Asia, has since said that ultimately it would be for the defence
  minister Boris Pistorius to make a decision, and has denied that he “directly
  or indirectly” doubted the capacity of Germany’s military. The remarks come at
  a time when Germany is in the midst of a lively debate about how it might
  boost military recruits, and whether it should reintroduce conscription. In
  other news, Italian police have arrested a Ukrainian man suspected of
  coordinating the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany’s prosecutor
  general said, adding that he would be brought before a German judge after
  being transferred, Reuters reported. The suspect, identified only as Serhii K.
  under German privacy laws, was part of a group of people who planted devices
  on the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022, a
  statement from the prosecutor’s office said. The prosecutor’s office allege
  that the man and his accomplices had set off from Rostock on Germany’s
  north-eastern coast in a sailing yacht to carry out the attack, adding that
  the vessel had been rented from a German company with the help of forged
  identity documents via middlemen. Carabinieri officers arrested the suspect
  overnight in the province of Rimini on Italy’s Adriatic coast, the German
  prosecutors’ statement said. Reuters noted that no one has ever taken
  responsibility for explosions that severely damaged pipelines carrying gas
  from Russia to Europe in September 2022, marking a major escalation in the
  Ukraine conflict and ramping up an energy supply crisis on the continent.
  Meanwhile, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has been speaking in the
  last few minutes, shifting blame for little progress onto Ukraine. In
  comments, reported by Reuters, he claimed without offering evidence that
  Ukraine wanted to “undermine Trump’s efforts to resolve conflict,” and
  insisted that Russia “was already ready for an honest talk about security
  guarantees,” but along the lines of its maximalist 2022 proposal. Lavrov even
  appeared to question Zelenskyy’s legitimacy to sign any deal, saying that
  “when it comes to signing something, the issues of legitimate of the Ukrainian
  representative will have to be resolved.” He also criticised the “Coalition of
  the Willing,” saying they wanted to “shift the focus away from resolving the
  root causes of the conflict,” and saying that he hoped “such European
  adventurism fails.” Lavrov also rejected any suggestion that European troops
  could be present in Ukraine as part of security guarantees, saying it would be
  “completely unacceptable” for Russia. Zelenskyy also told reporters that he
  would want to see an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine before
  meeting Russia’s Vladimir Putin, AFP said. He warned that in the meantime both
  sides were preparing for further fighting, with Russia building up troops on
  the southern frontline and Ukraine test launching a new long-range cruise
  missile. “We want to have an understanding of the security guarantees
  architecture within seven to 10 days,” Zelensky said, in comments to reporters
  released for publication Thursday. “We need to understand which country will
  be ready to do what at each specific moment,” he said. A group of allies led
  by Britain and France are putting together a military coalition to support the
  guarantees. Zelenskyy also indicated his preference on where the meeting could
  take place, calling for a “neutral” European country. “Switzerland, Austria –
  we agree... For us, Turkey is a Nato country and part of Europe. And we are
  not opposed,” Zelensky said of possible venues. We are also getting more
  details from Zelenskyy’s comments to a group of reporters, via agencies. The
  Ukrainian president revealed that during his meeting with Donald Trump on
  Monday, he asked the US leader to pressure Hungary into dropping its veto on
  Kyiv’s bid to join the EU, AFP reported. “It is absolutely fair that Ukraine
  wants to join the European Union... This is our sovereign right,” Zelensky
  told reporters. “President Trump promised that his team would work on this,”
  he said. Bloomberg reported yesterday (£) that Trump indeed called Hungary’s
  Viktor Orbán later to discuss the issue. If you followed the blog on
  Wednesday, you know we looked at an incident with an allegedly Russian drone
  that crossed into Poland and exploded in a cornfield, some 100 km from
  Polish-Belarusian border. A regional prosecutor issued an update today, saying
  that “there is a very high probability … that the object probably came from
  Belarus.” That marks a slight shift of tone, as on Wednesday officials claimed
  the drone was launched from Russia. But deputy foreign minister Marcin Bosacki
  said this morning that a protest note would be given to Russia later today,
  Reuters reported. European community affairs correspondent Days after the
  unprecedented flurry of diplomacy, questions continue to swirl over what – if
  anything – might come out of it. On Monday, Trump and several European
  leaders, said Putin had agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy in the
  coming weeks. Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any such meeting –
  which would be the first since Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine
  more than three years ago – is being planned, with a Kremlin aide saying only
  that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising the level of
  representatives” in the Ukraine talks. Trump had also indicated a willingness
  to be part of security guarantees for Kyiv if there was a deal to end
  fighting. But the exact nature of those guarantees remains to be seen, with
  Trump later ruling out the possibility of the US putting troops on the ground
  in Ukraine and instead floating that Washington could provide air support.
  Concerns also continue to linger over what exactly Trump proposed in Alaska
  and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the near three-hour meeting. As
  Pjotr Sauer, a Guardian Russian affairs reporter, noted, some fear Trump may
  have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to compromise.
  In further comments from Zelenskyy this morning, reported by Reuters, he said
  it was unclear what concessions regarding territory Moscow was willing to make
  to end the war. Trump has previously said Kyiv and Moscow will both need to
  cede land. “To discuss what Ukraine is willing to do, let’s first hear what
  Russia is willing to do,” Zelenskiy said. “We do not know that.“ Three days on
  from the White House summit on Ukraine, the signals are no longer as positive
  as US president Donald Trump would have wanted us to believe. Overnight,
  Politico reported that the US undersecretary of defence for policy, Elbridge
  Colby, told European allies that the US would only offer minimal guarantees
  for Ukraine, with most burden left for Europe to pick up. A Nato diplomat
  briefered on the talks told Politico: “The US is not fully committed to
  anything.” Any prospects of making further diplomatic progress also appeared
  to have stalled, with numerous Russian officials and diplomats toning down the
  expectations for both ceasefire and a potential Zelenskyy-Putin meeting.
  Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that any meeting would need to be
  prepared “with the utmost care”, while the country’s deputy representative to
  the UN, Dmitry Polansky, told the BBC that “it shouldn’t be a meeting for the
  sake of a meeting.” Or to translate to plain English: thanks but no, thanks.
  Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to these stalling tactics this
  morning, calling for a “strong reaction” from the US if Putin refuses to meet
  him, as discussed with Trump. The Ukrainian president also appeared to play
  down the prospect of the Hungarian capital, Budapest, hosting the potential
  summit with Putin, calling it “challenging.” Hungary has long been Russia’s
  loudest advocate within the European Union, often looking to delay or block
  the sanctions, and criticising Kyiv and other capitals for their approach to
  the war. Budapest is also blocking Ukraine’s accession process to the EU.
  Zelenskyy also pointed out another round of Russian attacks overnight,
  including against an American enterprise in Zakarpatia region, which injured
  15 people. He said the attacks were “as if nothing had changed at all.” “A
  response is needed to this. There is still no signal from Moscow that they are
  really going to go into meaningful negotiations and end this war. Pressure is
  needed. Strong sanctions, strong tariffs.” I will bring you all the key
  updates here. It’s Thursday, 21 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this
  is Europe Live. Good morning.

So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.” Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after saying on the campaign trail last year he could achieve it in 24 hours. Šefčovič is still speaking, confirming among others that the digital sector was kept out of the current trade talks with the US, among others. But in a blow to EU winemakers and spirit producers, he says the bloc could not secure a deal in this area, despite lobbying from Europe’s greatest winemakers in France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal. He says: “The tariffs on the wine, spirits and beer was one of very important offensive interests of the European Union. Unfortunately here, we didn’t succeed to get this sector and this category among the sectors which would continue to be on the MFN [Most Favoured Nation] level. I just would like to add one very important word, and this is: yet. Because our US colleagues, they know that this is our offensive interests, that’s something which is very important for us. And therefore I would also refer you to the paragraph which is very important for us, which says that both parties, the United States and the EU, are ready to look at other sectors where we could lower these tariffs in the future.” Importantly for EU’s carmakers, Šefčovič says that the bloc was pushing to get new 15% tariff applied retroactively back to 1 August. “I believe this is welcome news for our car industry, which was bleeding a lot of cash over the last few months,” he says, saying it weighed on the negotiators’ minds. He said the EU was looking to present necessary legislative proposal this month. Back to Brussels, EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is speaking now on the EU-US trade arrangements. He reiterates the point made by von der Leyen in the press statement that the joint statement “this is not the end, it’s the beginning.” “This framework is the first step, one that can grow over time to cover more sectors, improve market access and strengthen our economic ties even further, this work has been intense and essential,” he says. He stresses the importance of the arrangement, saying: “This carries considerable weight and is truly impactful at the time when the trade landscape has completely changed. Our transatlantic relationship is one of the largest economic partnerships in the world, and this agreement has a clear common goal, to put it on solid ground and help drive free industrialization on both sides of the Atlantic, and we want to fully unleash the potential of our combined economic power.” Similarly to his comments in the past, he also says that the alternative to this, however imperfect, deal was much worse. “The alternative, a trade war with sky high tariffs and political escalation, helps no one. It hurts jobs. It hurts growth, and it damages businesses across both the EU and the US. And this is not theoretical as nearly 5 million European jobs, including many in SMEs would be at risk. This deal avoids that path.” Russia’s foreign minister warned that Moscow must have an effective veto over any measures to support Ukraine once a peace deal is reached, undermining western plans to provide Kyiv with security guarantees. In a series of hardline remarks (12:30), Sergei Lavrov said European proposals to deploy troops in Ukraine after a settlement would amount to “foreign intervention,” which he called absolutely unacceptable for Russia. He also poured cold water on the prospect of a Putin–Zelenskyy summit touted by Donald Trump, saying a bilateral meeting at the highest level would only be possible “if all issues requiring discussion are thoroughly prepared.” Russia’s veteran foreign minister further questioned whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy had the legitimacy to sign any future peace accord, parroting a familiar Kremlin line that portrays Ukraine’s leadership as illegitimate. Lavrov’s remarks cast doubt on the prospects for peace talks, suggesting that Russia is retreating from the understandings reached in Alaska – where Trump claimed Vladimir Putin had accepted western security guarantees for Ukraine – or that the US administration may have misinterpreted the Kremlin’s position from the outset. It’s worth remembering that the joint statement is still technically not legally binding on the parties, but is a “blueprint” or a “road map” that further spells out and advances their political commitments on the EU-US trade, progressing the talks in Turnberry. We should hear more about the deal from the EU’s trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who is expected to be up at the European Commission shortly. I will bring you the key lines here. We have just heard from the European Commission, confirming that the EU and the US have now agreed on the much-awaited “joint statement” advancing the political commitments on trade agreed by Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump in Scotland last month. The commission’s press release says the statement “lays out in detail the new US tariff regime towards the EU, with a clear maximum, all-inclusive, tariff rate of 15% for the vast majority of EU exports, including strategic sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber.” “Sectors which are already subject to Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs of 15% or above, will not be subject to additional tariffs,” it added. It also said that “with regard to cars and car parts, the 15% US tariff ceiling will apply in tandem with the EU initiating the procedures for tariff reductions vis-a-vis US products.” Separately, a senior US official told Reuters that tariff relief for EU carmakers were expected to come in “hopefully weeks.” The text of the joint statement also confirms the EU’s commitment to “procure US liquified natural gas, oil and nuclear energy products” valued at $750bn through 2028, with another $40bn expected to be spent on US AI chips for computing centres. Von der Leyen welcomed the publication, saying that “faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our Member States and industry, and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade.” She also hinted that the EU would continue working “to agree more tariff reductions, to identify more areas of cooperation, and to create more economic growth potential.” in Berlin Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, has had to row back on comments he made earlier this week, in which he suggested that Germany’s military would be too overstretched if it had to send troops to Ukraine. Wadepfuhl said in an interview that the Bundeswehr was already contributing troops to a combat-ready brigade in Lithuania. “Doing that and also stationing troops in Ukraine would probably overstretch us,” he said. The discussion over troops in Ukraine concerns finding a security guarantee for Ukraine if and when Moscow ceased its war on the country. One suggestion has been for Nato members to station troops in the country, even as Moscow has said it’ll not accept such an arrangement. Wadephul made the remarks ahead of the key meeting in Washington between Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelenskyy, US president Donald Trump, and a number of their European counterparts. Wadepfuhl, who is on a trade trip to Asia, has since said that ultimately it would be for the defence minister Boris Pistorius to make a decision, and has denied that he “directly or indirectly” doubted the capacity of Germany’s military. The remarks come at a time when Germany is in the midst of a lively debate about how it might boost military recruits, and whether it should reintroduce conscription. In other news, Italian police have arrested a Ukrainian man suspected of coordinating the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany’s prosecutor general said, adding that he would be brought before a German judge after being transferred, Reuters reported. The suspect, identified only as Serhii K. under German privacy laws, was part of a group of people who planted devices on the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022, a statement from the prosecutor’s office said. The prosecutor’s office allege that the man and his accomplices had set off from Rostock on Germany’s north-eastern coast in a sailing yacht to carry out the attack, adding that the vessel had been rented from a German company with the help of forged identity documents via middlemen. Carabinieri officers arrested the suspect overnight in the province of Rimini on Italy’s Adriatic coast, the German prosecutors’ statement said. Reuters noted that no one has ever taken responsibility for explosions that severely damaged pipelines carrying gas from Russia to Europe in September 2022, marking a major escalation in the Ukraine conflict and ramping up an energy supply crisis on the continent. Meanwhile, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has been speaking in the last few minutes, shifting blame for little progress onto Ukraine. In comments, reported by Reuters, he claimed without offering evidence that Ukraine wanted to “undermine Trump’s efforts to resolve conflict,” and insisted that Russia “was already ready for an honest talk about security guarantees,” but along the lines of its maximalist 2022 proposal. Lavrov even appeared to question Zelenskyy’s legitimacy to sign any deal, saying that “when it comes to signing something, the issues of legitimate of the Ukrainian representative will have to be resolved.” He also criticised the “Coalition of the Willing,” saying they wanted to “shift the focus away from resolving the root causes of the conflict,” and saying that he hoped “such European adventurism fails.” Lavrov also rejected any suggestion that European troops could be present in Ukraine as part of security guarantees, saying it would be “completely unacceptable” for Russia. Zelenskyy also told reporters that he would want to see an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine before meeting Russia’s Vladimir Putin, AFP said. He warned that in the meantime both sides were preparing for further fighting, with Russia building up troops on the southern frontline and Ukraine test launching a new long-range cruise missile. “We want to have an understanding of the security guarantees architecture within seven to 10 days,” Zelensky said, in comments to reporters released for publication Thursday. “We need to understand which country will be ready to do what at each specific moment,” he said. A group of allies led by Britain and France are putting together a military coalition to support the guarantees. Zelenskyy also indicated his preference on where the meeting could take place, calling for a “neutral” European country. “Switzerland, Austria – we agree... For us, Turkey is a Nato country and part of Europe. And we are not opposed,” Zelensky said of possible venues. We are also getting more details from Zelenskyy’s comments to a group of reporters, via agencies. The Ukrainian president revealed that during his meeting with Donald Trump on Monday, he asked the US leader to pressure Hungary into dropping its veto on Kyiv’s bid to join the EU, AFP reported. “It is absolutely fair that Ukraine wants to join the European Union... This is our sovereign right,” Zelensky told reporters. “President Trump promised that his team would work on this,” he said. Bloomberg reported yesterday (£) that Trump indeed called Hungary’s Viktor Orbán later to discuss the issue. If you followed the blog on Wednesday, you know we looked at an incident with an allegedly Russian drone that crossed into Poland and exploded in a cornfield, some 100 km from Polish-Belarusian border. A regional prosecutor issued an update today, saying that “there is a very high probability … that the object probably came from Belarus.” That marks a slight shift of tone, as on Wednesday officials claimed the drone was launched from Russia. But deputy foreign minister Marcin Bosacki said this morning that a protest note would be given to Russia later today, Reuters reported. European community affairs correspondent Days after the unprecedented flurry of diplomacy, questions continue to swirl over what – if anything – might come out of it. On Monday, Trump and several European leaders, said Putin had agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy in the coming weeks. Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any such meeting – which would be the first since Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago – is being planned, with a Kremlin aide saying only that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising the level of representatives” in the Ukraine talks. Trump had also indicated a willingness to be part of security guarantees for Kyiv if there was a deal to end fighting. But the exact nature of those guarantees remains to be seen, with Trump later ruling out the possibility of the US putting troops on the ground in Ukraine and instead floating that Washington could provide air support. Concerns also continue to linger over what exactly Trump proposed in Alaska and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the near three-hour meeting. As Pjotr Sauer, a Guardian Russian affairs reporter, noted, some fear Trump may have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to compromise. In further comments from Zelenskyy this morning, reported by Reuters, he said it was unclear what concessions regarding territory Moscow was willing to make to end the war. Trump has previously said Kyiv and Moscow will both need to cede land. “To discuss what Ukraine is willing to do, let’s first hear what Russia is willing to do,” Zelenskiy said. “We do not know that.“ Three days on from the White House summit on Ukraine, the signals are no longer as positive as US president Donald Trump would have wanted us to believe. Overnight, Politico reported that the US undersecretary of defence for policy, Elbridge Colby, told European allies that the US would only offer minimal guarantees for Ukraine, with most burden left for Europe to pick up. A Nato diplomat briefered on the talks told Politico: “The US is not fully committed to anything.” Any prospects of making further diplomatic progress also appeared to have stalled, with numerous Russian officials and diplomats toning down the expectations for both ceasefire and a potential Zelenskyy-Putin meeting. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that any meeting would need to be prepared “with the utmost care”, while the country’s deputy representative to the UN, Dmitry Polansky, told the BBC that “it shouldn’t be a meeting for the sake of a meeting.” Or to translate to plain English: thanks but no, thanks. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to these stalling tactics this morning, calling for a “strong reaction” from the US if Putin refuses to meet him, as discussed with Trump. The Ukrainian president also appeared to play down the prospect of the Hungarian capital, Budapest, hosting the potential summit with Putin, calling it “challenging.” Hungary has long been Russia’s loudest advocate within the European Union, often looking to delay or block the sanctions, and criticising Kyiv and other capitals for their approach to the war. Budapest is also blocking Ukraine’s accession process to the EU. Zelenskyy also pointed out another round of Russian attacks overnight, including against an American enterprise in Zakarpatia region, which injured 15 people. He said the attacks were “as if nothing had changed at all.” “A response is needed to this. There is still no signal from Moscow that they are really going to go into meaningful negotiations and end this war. Pressure is needed. Strong sanctions, strong tariffs.” I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Thursday, 21 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
