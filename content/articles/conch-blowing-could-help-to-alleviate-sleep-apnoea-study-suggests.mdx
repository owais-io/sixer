  Blowing into a conch shell could help tackle the symptoms of a sleep disorder
  that affects millions of people across the UK, according to a study. Conch
  blowing, also known as shankh blowing, is an ancient ritual that involves
  breathing in deeply and exhaling into the spiral-shaped shell. The practice
  could improve sleep for patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which
  usually needs to be treated with uncomfortable machinery, according to the
  research. OSA occurs when breathing starts and stops during sleep. Symptoms
  include loud snoring and making gasping or choking noises. Thirty people
  living with the disorder and aged between 19 and 65 were involved in the
  trial, led by researchers at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research
  Institute in Jaipur, India. About half of the group were taught how to use the
  shell, while the others carried out deep breathing exercises. Both groups were
  encouraged to practise their techniques for at least 15 minutes, five days a
  week. Six months later, the trial found that those who had practiced shankh
  blowing were 34% less sleepy during the day. They also had higher blood oxygen
  levels during the night, and four to five fewer OSA episodes an hour on
  average. “Shankh blowing is a simple low-cost breathing technique that could
  help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or
  medication,” said Dr Krishna K Sharma, who led the research. “The way the
  shankh is blown is quite distinctive. This action creates strong vibrations
  and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper
  airway, including the throat and soft palate, areas that often collapse during
  sleep in people with OSA.” The most common form of treatment for sleep apnoea
  is a continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machine, which involves
  patients wearing a mask that blows pressurised air into the nose and throat
  while asleep. Previous research has also found that playing a woodwind
  instrument could help with the condition. Although the machines are effective,
  they can be uncomfortable, leading the researchers to suggest that shankh
  blowing could be a promising alternative. A larger trial involving several
  hospitals is being planned. “The findings of this trial are encouraging, but
  the small scale of the trial means it’s too soon to say for certain that conch
  blowing can help people manage their obstructive sleep apnoea,” said Dr Erika
  Kennington, the head of research and innovation at Asthma + Lung UK. “It’s
  also not clear from this research why blowing through a conch shell regularly
  might improve someone’s symptoms. It would be good to see the conch blowing
  approach tested on a larger scale and compared with other proven strategies,
  such as limiting alcohol, staying active and maintaining good bedtime habits.
  “OSA is a long-term condition, but with the right treatments and lifestyle
  changes, people can make a real difference to their symptoms.”
