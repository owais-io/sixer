  Donald Trump has said he will issue an executive order to mandate voter
  identification at all US elections, with “no exceptions”. “Voter I.D. Must Be
  Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order
  To That End!!!,” the US president said on Truth Social late on Saturday. Any
  such move is likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional. The US
  constitution grants primary authority to regulate elections to the US states,
  while empowering Congress to enact election laws or regulations. It gives no
  explicit authority to the president to regulate voting. Voter fraud is
  incredibly rare and voter ID laws have been shown to disproportionately impact
  minorities, low-income individuals and disabled voters. “As many as 11% of
  eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with
  strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors,
  minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the
  Brennan Center for Justice states. Trump wants to ban mail-in voting The US
  president also stated he wants to ban all voting by mail except for those who
  are very ill or in military service. The voting change push by Trump stems
  from baseless claims that the 2020 election he lost was stolen from him.
  Earlier this month, Trump falsely claimed only the US uses mail-in voting.
  Dozens of countries permit at least some form of mail-in voting. Read the full
  story Visa approvals reportedly halted for Palestinian passport holders The
  United States has suspended visa approvals for nearly everyone who holds a
  Palestinian passport, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The restrictions
  go beyond those Donald Trump’s administration had previously announced on
  visitors from Gaza. Read the full story Illinois governor urges ‘all to stand
  up’ to Trump immigration crackdown Governor JB Pritzker has said he will do
  everything he can to stop Trump taking away people’s rights and urged everyone
  to take a stand as the US president prepares to launch an immigration
  crackdown across Chicago. Pritzker, a Democrat, told CBS on Sunday: “Any kind
  of troops on the streets of an American city don’t belong unless there is an
  insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not … I’m going to
  do everything I can to stop him from taking away people’s rights and from
  using the military to invade states. I think it’s very important for us all to
  stand up.” Read the full story Judge pauses deportation of hundreds of
  Guatemalan children A federal judge has ordered an emergency halt to a plan by
  the Trump administration to deport a group of nearly 700 unaccompanied
  Guatemalan children after immigrant advocates lawyers called the plan
  “illegal”. Judge Sparkle L Sooknanan said those children couldn’t be deported
  for at least 14 days, and after a hastily scheduled hearing on Sunday, she
  enforced that they needed to be taken off the planes and back to the Office of
  Refugee Resettlement facilities while the legal process plays out. Read the
  full story FDA vaccine chief demands videos of him criticizing Covid vaccines
  be removed A top official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanded
  the removal of YouTube videos of himself that were published by a physician
  and writer who has been critical of medical misinformation and public health
  officials in the Trump administration, according to a YouTube notice that was
  seen by the Guardian. Read the full story Former CDC official warns of ‘harm’
  to public health under RFK Jr Demetre Daskalakis, the former immunizations
  director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned of the
  future of American health under the leadership of health secretary, Robert F
  Kennedy Jr, saying: “I only see harm coming.” He went on to add: “I may be
  wrong, but based on what I’m seeing, based on what I’ve heard with the new
  members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, or ACIP, they’re
  really moving in an ideological direction where they want to see the undoing
  of vaccination.” Read the full story What else happened today: Rudy Giuliani
  was hospitalised after a car crash in New Hampshire. He was treated for a
  fractured thoracic vertebrae, and multiple cuts and bruises. Water quality
  warnings have been issued at beaches across the US during the Labor Day
  holiday weekend due to detection of elevated levels of bacteria associated
  with fecal waste. Catching up? Here’s what happened on 30 August 2025.
