  Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said prime minister
  Benjamin Netanyahu and US president Donald Trump had agreed to revive the
  contentious E1 settlement scheme – although there was no immediate
  confirmation from either leader. It comes after we reported earlier that
  Smotrich announced plans to begin construction on a settlement that would
  divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem. Qatar, Iraq and
  Jordan have all issued strong condemnations of recent statements concerning
  the occupied West Bank. In a statement from Doha on Thursday, Qatar’s foreign
  ministry said it “strongly condemns” Israeli finance minister Bezalel
  Smotrich’s approval of plans to construct a settlement that would separate
  East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, calling it “a blatant violation of
  international legitimacy, particularly United Nations Security Council
  Resolution 2334”. Israeli advocacy group Peace Now has condemned plans to
  expand settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under
  international law, the group said. The plans, announced by Israel’s far-right
  finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, approve tenders for more than 3,000 housing
  units in the controversial E1 settlement project between Jerusalem and Ma’ale
  Adumim in the West Bank. In an act of international journalistic solidarity,
  the Swedish Union of Journalists (SJF) staged a demonstration in Stockholm,
  protesting the targeted killings of Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The
  demonstration follows am Israeli airstrike on Sunday that claimed the lives of
  four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelance media workers sheltering near a
  tent outside the Al-Shifa Hospital. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza
  has just issued its daily death toll. It says 54 people have been killed and
  831 injured in the past 24 hours, adding that some victims remain under the
  rubble or on roads that ambulance and civil defence crews are unable to reach.
  Mossad spy chief David Barnea is visiting Qatar to revive Gaza peace talks,
  two Israeli officials told Reuters on Thursday. The visit follows a reported
  expression of eagerness by Hamas for a swift return to Gaza ceasefire
  negotiations during a meeting with Egypt’s intelligence chief in Cairo.
  Italy’s defence ministry says it has completed the largest medical evacuation
  from Gaza since January last year, flying 31 children and 83 accompanying
  relatives to Ciampino, Milan and Pisa overnight. The patients and their
  families have been admitted to Italian hospitals for medical care and
  specialist treatment. With this mission, Italy says it has now taken in more
  than 180 children from Gaza, along with 580 people in total, for treatment.
  Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied accusations that Israel
  is committing genocide or intentionally starving civilians in Gaza, saying
  such claims are “false”. More than 100 international NGOs have accused Israel
  of using humanitarian aid as a weapon in Gaza, saying most major agencies have
  been unable to deliver a single truck of supplies since early March. In a
  statement carried by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
  Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Health Organisation says medical supply
  entry into Gaza remains “difficult and ever changing” despite the delivery of
  80 trucks of supplies since June 25, when a suspension of more than three
  months was lifted. Riot police at Greece’s largest port, Piraeus, cordoned off
  an area around a cruise ship early Thursday to prevent several hundred
  protesters from approaching the vessel. The Crown Iris, carrying Israeli
  tourists, has faced demonstrations at Greek islands and mainland ports along
  its route, some of which have led to clashes with police. Human Rights Watch
  has described as “abhorrent” reports that the Israeli government is in talks
  with five countries – Indonesia, Somaliland, Uganda, South Sudan and Libya –
  about taking displaced Palestinians from Gaza. Israeli broadcaster Channel 12
  reported on Wednesday that such discussions were taking place. The head of the
  Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) says he is working to reinstate a
  documentary about the October 7 attacks after its removal from the schedule
  sparked a public outcry in Israel. Cameron Bailey, TIFF’s CEO, said the
  Canadian film The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue was initially withdrawn
  due to issues surrounding “legal clearance of all footage”. Palestinians
  struggle to collect humanitarian aid airdropped by parachutes into Gaza City,
  northern Gaza Strip, on Thursday. We are starting to see responses to Israeli
  far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich saying prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu and US president Donald Trump had agreed to revive the contentious
  E1 settlement scheme. Eropean Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said
  during a press briefing: The EU rejects any territorial change that is not
  part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation of
  territory is illegal under international law. Meanwhile, Norwegian foreign
  minister Espen Barth Eide said the move showed that Israel “seeks to
  appropriate land owned by Palestinians in order to prevent a two-state
  solution”. Qatar, which has mediated between Hamas and Israel in efforts to
  secure a ceasefire in Gaza, condemned Smotrich’s actions as a “blatant
  violation of international law”. Human Rights Watch has described as
  “abhorrent” reports that the Israeli government is in talks with five
  countries – Indonesia, Somaliland, Uganda, South Sudan and Libya – about
  taking displaced Palestinians from Gaza. Israeli broadcaster Channel 12
  reported on Wednesday that such discussions were taking place. Milena Ansari,
  Israel and Palestine assistant researcher at Human Rights Watch, told the
  Guardian: Hearing Israeli officials flaunt abhorrent plans to escalate forced
  displacement and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza should trigger
  outrage in the international community. Instead of standing beside a
  government whose Prime Minister is wanted for atrocity crimes by the
  International Criminal Court, states should make clear their categorical
  opposition to such actions and take concrete actions to prevent the
  extermination of Palestinians. Anything less will only magnify the possibility
  they could be held complicit in Israel’s crimes of forced displacement. The
  report came a day after the Associated Press said Israel had discussed sending
  Palestinians to South Sudan. The Israeli government has previously called for
  the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians from Gaza amid the ongoing war. Riot
  police at Greece’s largest port, Piraeus, cordoned off an area around a cruise
  ship early Thursday to prevent several hundred protesters from approaching the
  vessel. The Crown Iris, carrying Israeli tourists, has faced demonstrations at
  Greek islands and mainland ports along its route, some of which have led to
  clashes with police. At Piraeus, near Athens, demonstrators held flares and
  waved Palestinian flags behind a cordon formed with riot police buses. Protest
  organisers, citing online posts from travellers, claimed off-duty Israeli
  soldiers were among the passengers. “They are unwanted here and have no
  business being here,” protest organiser Markos Bekris said. “The blood of
  innocent people is on their hands, and we should not welcome them.” Greece
  remains a popular holiday destination for Israelis, but the ongoing war on
  Gaza, and global attention on the widespread destruction and severe food
  shortages, has sparked hundreds of anti-Israel protests in Athens and other
  Greek cities and towns. Opposition parties have called on the conservative
  government to halt commercial and military cooperation with Israel. In an act
  of international journalistic solidarity, the Swedish Union of Journalists
  (SJF) staged a demonstration in Stockholm, protesting the targeted killings of
  Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The demonstration follows am Israeli
  airstrike on Sunday that claimed the lives of four Al Jazeera journalists and
  two freelance media workers sheltering near a tent outside the Al-Shifa
  Hospital. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 192
  journalists and media workers have been killed since the onset of the war in
  late 2023. In a statement shared on social media, SJF decried the ongoing
  violence against press freedoms as “unacceptable and must come to an end,”
  adding: “the message is simple – stop killing our colleagues”. Qatar, Iraq and
  Jordan have all issued strong condemnations of recent statements concerning
  the occupied West Bank. In a statement from Doha on Thursday, Qatar’s foreign
  ministry said it “strongly condemns” Israeli finance minister Bezalel
  Smotrich’s approval of plans to construct a settlement that would separate
  East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, calling it “a blatant violation of
  international legitimacy, particularly United Nations Security Council
  Resolution 2334”. Iraq’s foreign ministry also “strongly condemns” remarks by
  prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week in which he said he felt
  “very attached” to the vision of a so-called “Greater Israel”. The ministry
  described the comments as “a blatant provocation and a clear violation of the
  sovereignty of states, a breach of international law, and the charter of the
  United Nations”. Jordan’s foreign ministry criticised Smotrich’s announcement
  that he intends to approve tenders to build more than 3,000 homes in the E1
  area settlement project linking Jerusalem to Maale Adumim. Its spokesperson,
  ambassador Sufyan Qudah, said the plan and other “illegal Israeli measures”
  were “a blatant violation of international law”. My colleague Peter Beaumont
  his written a fuller report on an earlier blog post on Aid groups saying that
  Israel’s new registration rules “are weaponising aid”: More than 100 aid
  organisations working in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have accused Israel
  of dangerously “weaponising aid” in its application of new rules for
  registering groups involved in delivering humanitarian assistance. The letter
  represents the latest broadside from the international aid community against
  Israel after the EU, Britain and Japan on Tuesday called for urgent action to
  stop “famine” spreading in the Gaza Strip. Mossad spy chief David Barnea is
  visiting Qatar to revive Gaza peace talks, two Israeli officials told Reuters
  on Thursday. The visit follows a reported expression of eagerness by Hamas for
  a swift return to Gaza ceasefire negotiations during a meeting with Egypt’s
  intelligence chief in Cairo. Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel
  Smotrich said prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US president Donald Trump
  had agreed to revive the contentious E1 settlement scheme – although there was
  no immediate confirmation from either leader. It comes after we reported
  earlier that Smotrich announced plans to begin construction on a settlement
  that would divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem. Standing
  at the site in Ma’ale Adumim, Smotrich said: Whoever in the world is trying to
  recognise a Palestinian state today will receive our answer on the ground. Not
  with documents nor with decisions or statements, but with facts. Facts of
  houses, facts of neighbourhoods. Smotrich told Reuters the plan would go into
  effect on Wednesday, without specifying what would happen that day. Most of
  the international community considers all settlements illegal under
  international law, a position backed by multiple UN Security Council
  resolutions calling on Israel to halt settlement activity. In June, Britain,
  Canada, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Smotrich and another
  far-right minister who advocates settlement expansion, accusing them of
  repeatedly inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
  Palestinians mourn loved ones killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza Earlier we
  reported that Syria’s official Ekhbariya TV said an explosion had been heard
  in Idlib, in the north-west of the country. Syria’s state news agency is now
  reporting that at least four people were killed and five injured in an
  explosion on the outskirts of Idlib city on Thursday. An Iranian government
  spokesperson has compared Israel’s war in Gaza to the atomic bombings of
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In a post on X, Esmaeil Baqaei, head of Iran’s Centre
  for Public Diplomacy, said: As the world marks the 80th anniversary of the
  atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, UN human rights experts have noted
  that Israel’s genocidal attacks evoke painful parallels with the nuclear
  attacks on Japan. Quoting a statement published by the UN human rights
  council, Baqaei added: “Of particular concern is Israel’s perpetration of
  these genocidal attacks, while it remains as the sole nuclear power in the
  Middle East, continuing to threaten regional stability with attacks against
  most of its neighbouring states, including attacks against nuclear facilities
  in Iran.” Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel has just provided
  some insight into the country’s post-war plans for Gaza. She said a
  non-Israeli, peaceful civilian administration for Gaza was among the
  government’s five key principles for ending the war. The other principles
  include the release of hostages still held in Gaza, the surrender of weapons
  by Hamas, the full demilitarization of Gaza, and Israel retaining overriding
  security controls, she added. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has
  just issued its daily death toll. It says 54 people have been killed and 831
  injured in the past 24 hours, adding that some victims remain under the rubble
  or on roads that ambulance and civil defence crews are unable to reach.
  According to the ministry, the death toll from Israeli military action since 7
  October 2023 has risen to 61,776, with 154,906 injured. Since 18 March 2025
  when the ceasefire ended, it says 10,251 people have been killed and 42,865
  injured. The ministry said 22 of those killed in the past day died in
  incidents involving aid convoys, along with 269 injuries, bringing the total
  number of what it calls “aid victims” to 1,881 dead and more than 13,863
  injured since the start of the war. Earlier, the ministry also reported four
  deaths from famine and malnutrition in the past 24 hours, bringing the total
  to 239, including 106 children. Italy’s defence ministry says it has completed
  the largest medical evacuation from Gaza since January last year, flying 31
  children and 83 accompanying relatives to Ciampino, Milan and Pisa overnight.
  The patients and their families have been admitted to Italian hospitals for
  medical care and specialist treatment. With this mission, Italy says it has
  now taken in more than 180 children from Gaza, along with 580 people in total,
  for treatment. The ministry said Italy is the fourth country in the world, and
  the first among Western nations, for the evacuation and transfer of
  Palestinian patients to specialised hospitals. “In dramatic contexts like that
  of the Gaza Strip, solidarity is expressed through concrete actions rather
  than words,” defence minister Guido Crosetto said. “Today’s medical transport
  is a further sign of Italy’s commitment alongside the civilian population
  affected by a severe humanitarian emergency. Giving hope, saving a life,
  especially that of suffering children, means affirming the fundamental values
  we identify with.” Crosetto thanked the defence, foreign and interior
  ministries, Italy’s civil protection department, and the healthcare personnel
  caring for the young patients. Earlier we reported that Israeli far-right
  finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to advance tenders for more
  than 3,000 housing units in the E1 settlement project between Jerusalem and
  Ma’ale Adumim – in what advocacy groups criticised as illegal under
  international law. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates
  has just issued a strong rebuke of the measures, calling the tenders as being
  linked to “the notion of ‘Greater Israel’” and part of a wider plan to
  “undermine the opportunity to establish the Palestinian state on its
  homeland”. It considers the colonial construction in the E1 area a
  continuation of the occupation’s plans to undermine the opportunity to
  establish the Palestinian state on its homeland, weaken its geographical and
  demographic unity, entrench the division of the West Bank into isolated areas
  surrounded by a sea of settlements, and facilitate the completion of their
  annexation. The Ministry views these tenders as an extension of the crimes of
  genocide, displacement, and annexation, and as an echo of Netanyahu’s
  statements regarding what he called ‘Greater Israel’. It called for “genuine
  international intervention” and sanctions to halt the plans, end the
  “genocide, displacement, and annexation”. Human Rights Watch (HRW) says
  Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s Evin prison in June killed scores of detainees,
  visitors and staff in what it has described as an “apparent war crime”. The
  rights group says survivors have since been subjected to abuse, enforced
  disappearances and inhumane detention conditions by Iranian authorities. The
  investigation, based on satellite imagery, videos and witness accounts, found
  the 23 June strikes destroyed visitation halls, prison wards, the central
  kitchen, the medical clinic and administrative offices. HRW said it found no
  evidence of military targets in the facility, which held more than 1,500
  prisoners at the time, many jailed for peaceful activism. Turning briefly to
  Syria, a UN investigation has found that war crimes were likely committed by
  both members of the interim government forces and fighters loyal to the
  country’s former rulers during an outbreak of sectarian violence in the
  coastal region in March. The UN Syria Commission of Inquiry says around 1,400
  people – mainly civilians from Alawi communities – were killed in the
  violence, which included torture, killings and inhumane treatment of the dead.
  The coastal incidents were the worst violence to hit Syria since the fall of
  President Bashar al-Assad last year. Meanwhile, fighting elsewhere in the
  country continues. An explosion was reported in Idlib on Thursday, with
  authorities working to verify its cause. Turkey has also just signed a
  military cooperation accord with Syria, pledging weapons systems, logistical
  support and training. The Turkish defence ministry said the Syrian Democratic
  Forces (SDF) – the Kurdish-led force allied with the US in the fight against
  ISIS – have yet to meet conditions for integration into Syria’s state
  apparatus under a March agreement, and urged compliance. Despite the deal,
  skirmishes have continued. Syria’s state news agency SANA reported a
  government soldier was killed earlier this week in clashes with the SDF in
  Aleppo province. In a surviving upstairs room at Gaza College, its walls
  pocked with shrapnel and windows blown out, a boy sits for a guitar class. His
  teacher, Mohammed Abu Mahadi, 32, says music can help heal the psychological
  wounds left by bombardment, loss and shortages. “What I do here is make
  children happy from music because it is one of the best ways for expressing
  feelings,” he said. The students were attending an Edward Said National
  Conservatory of Music lesson on 4 August, held in displacement camps and
  damaged buildings since Israeli strikes forced the school from its main base.
  “When I play I feel like I’m flying away,” said Rifan al-Qassas, 15, who began
  learning the oud at nine. “Music gives me hope and eases my fear.” Founded in
  the West Bank, the conservatory opened its Gaza branch 13 years ago. But after
  22 months of war, some students are now dead, including 14-year-old violinist
  Lubna Alyaan. The old school building now lies in ruins, its walls collapsed
  and rooms littered with debris. A grand piano is gone. For many, music is now
  the last place of refuge. The health ministry in Gaza has just issued a
  statement, saying four more people have died from famine and malnutrition in
  the past 24 hours. This brings the total to 239 since the start of the war,
  including 106 children, according to the health ministry. It warned that
  shortages of food and clean water, combined with the collapse of health
  services, are driving a worsening hunger crisis across the territory. The head
  of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) says he is working to
  reinstate a documentary about the October 7 attacks after its removal from the
  schedule sparked a public outcry in Israel. Cameron Bailey, TIFF’s CEO, said
  the Canadian film The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue was initially
  withdrawn due to issues surrounding “legal clearance of all footage”. However,
  in a statement published on X last night, Bailey said his “intention was to
  screen” the film and described it as “an important story” that adds to the
  festival’s “rich tapestry of perspectives”. Bailey rejected claims of
  censorship as “unequivocally false” and urged “patience and understanding”.
  The documentary follows Noam Tibon, who set out to rescue his son, journalist
  Amir Tibon, and his family during the attack on Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Its removal
  drew protests from Israel’s foreign ministry and the Canadian Centre for
  Israel and Jewish Affairs. Eight Palestinians have been killed in Israeli
  strikes in central Gaza and northwest of Gaza City, according to medical
  sources, cited by Wafa news agency. Staff at Al-Aqsa hospital said three
  people died when an Israeli drone fired a missile at a group of civilians in
  the al-Hakr area, south of Deir al-Balah. The Palestinian news agency also
  reported that Israeli drones also targeted a group of people northwest of Gaza
  City, killing five and injuring others. Israeli prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu has denied accusations that Israel is committing genocide or
  intentionally starving civilians in Gaza, saying such claims are “false”. In a
  video posted to the Israeli prime minister’s YouTube channel, speaking at the
  US Independence Day reception hosted by Newsmax in Jerusalem , Netanyahu said:
  The first false accusation is genocide. The second false accusation is
  starvation. From the first second day of the war, we said there has to be
  another separation between civilians and combatants and that is that we supply
  humanitarian aid. If we had a starvation policy, everybody in Gaza would be
  dead. But that’s not our policy. Netanyahu said diplomacy was “just another
  way to say defeat and surrender”, adding: “Victory” was “the last word left in
  the army’s lexicon”. He also told the audience: “Americans recognise that
  Israel stands for the same values as America. They recognise that we are
  fighting the barbarians at the gate … not only the goal of destroying Israel,
  it’s even the method that they use to murder and mutilate the heathen, as they
  call them.” We are just receiving pictures via the wires from inside Nasser
  Medical Complex, a hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. In a statement
  carried by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
  Affairs (OCHA), the World Health Organisation says medical supply entry into
  Gaza remains “difficult and ever changing” despite the delivery of 80 trucks
  of supplies since June 25, when a suspension of more than three months was
  lifted. Many critical items, including ICU beds, anaesthesia machines and cold
  chain medicines, have been denied entry, while clearance processes for goods
  arriving via Ben Gurion Airport remain slow, the statement said. WHO said it
  has delivered 6,000 blood units to Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, but these
  are only a fraction of what is needed as health facilities face mass casualty
  incidents and rising cases of infectious disease. Shortages of fuel for
  generators and spare parts are also crippling the 230 health points still
  partially functional across Gaza, the statement said. The UN agency for
  Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has just issued a warning on X, saying that
  soaring temperatures in Gaza are now above 40°C, making an already dire
  humanitarian situation “far worse”. “With very limited water available,
  dehydration is increasing,” the agency said in a post on X. It added that
  bombardments and forced displacement continue, while limited electricity and
  fuel mean there is “no relief from the extreme heat”. UNRWA reiterated its
  call for an immediate ceasefire. Israeli advocacy group Peace Now has
  condemned plans to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are
  illegal under international law, the group said. The plans, announced by
  Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, approve tenders for more
  than 3,000 housing units in the controversial E1 settlement project between
  Jerusalem and Ma’ale Adumim in the West Bank. Smotrich said in a statement
  cited by the Times of Israel: Approval of construction plans in E1 buries the
  idea of a Palestinian state and continues the many steps we are taking on the
  ground as part of the de facto sovereignty plan that we began implementing
  with the establishment of the government. After decades of international
  pressure and freezes, we are breaking conventions and connecting Ma’ale Adumim
  to Jerusalem. This is Zionism at its best – building, settling and
  strengthening our sovereignty in the Land of Israel. The E1 plan has been
  frozen for decades amid strong opposition from the international community,
  which warns it would divide the West Bank into northern and southern regions,
  and prevent the development of a Palestinian urban area linking East Jerusalem
  with Bethlehem and Ramallah. Peace Now said in a statement: “The E1 plan is
  deadly for the future of Israel and for any chance of achieving a peaceful
  two-state solution. We are standing at the edge of an abyss, and the
  government is driving us forward at full speed.” More than 100 international
  NGOs have accused Israel of using humanitarian aid as a weapon in Gaza, saying
  most major agencies have been unable to deliver a single truck of supplies
  since early March. Despite Israeli authorities claiming there is no limit on
  humanitarian aid entering the territory, the groups say dozens of requests to
  bring in food, medicine, water and shelter items have been rejected on the
  grounds that the organisations are “not authorized to deliver aid”. In July
  alone, more than 60 requests were denied, according to the statement. The aid
  backlog has left millions of dollars’ worth of goods stranded in warehouses in
  Jordan and Egypt, while hospitals run short of basic supplies and civilians
  die from hunger and preventable illnesses. Many of the affected organisations
  say they have worked in Gaza for decades. The groups link the obstruction to
  new registration rules introduced in March, which allow Israeli authorities to
  reject applications based on vague criteria such as alleged “delegitimisation”
  of the state. Agencies say the process is being used to control independent
  organisations and censor humanitarian reporting. “Since the full siege was
  imposed on 2 March, CARE has not been able to deliver any of our $1.5m worth
  of pre-positioned supplies into Gaza,” said Jolien Veldwijk, CARE’s country
  director. Oxfam said it has over $2.5m worth of goods blocked from entering.
  The signatories called on governments and donors to press Israel to end the
  restrictions, demand the opening of all land crossings, and ensure agencies
  can operate without compromising independence or staff safety. The Israeli
  military says the missile was fired overnight. In a statement posted on X, it
  said: “The Air Force intercepted one missile launched from Yemen; according to
  policy, no alerts were activated.” A Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya
  Saree, later claimed the group had targeted Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv
  “using a hypersonic ballistic missile”. Houthi rebels in Yemen have regularly
  launched missile and drone attacks on Israel, saying they are acting in
  solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has previously carried out
  strikes on areas under Houthi control, including ports in western Yemen and
  Sanaa airport. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Gaza. At
  least 123 people have been killed and 437 injured in the Gaza Strip over the
  past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health authorities. Hospitals also
  reported that eight people – including three children – died from starvation
  and malnutrition during the same period, bringing the total number of such
  deaths to 235, among them 106 children. The number of aid convoy victims
  recorded in the past day reached 21 dead and 185 injured, according to
  officials, bringing the total number killed in such incidents since the start
  of the war to 1,859, with more than 13,594 injured. Philippe Lazzarini, head
  of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), described the starvation
  deaths as the latest in the “war on children” in Gaza. The Israeli military
  said its chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, has approved the “main concept” for a new
  attack plan in the Gaza Strip, without giving further details. Reuters reports
  the decision comes after a rift between Israel’s political leadership and its
  military commanders. A Hamas official accused Israeli forces of making
  “aggressive” incursions into Gaza City on Wednesday after news of the plan’s
  approval. “The Israeli occupation forces continue to carry out aggressive
  incursions in Gaza City,” said Ismail Al-Thawabta, director general of the
  Hamas government media office. The Israeli military also said it struck a
  group of militants in Gaza disguised as aid workers and using a car with the
  logo of international charity World Central Kitchen. The charity confirmed
  that neither the men nor the vehicle were affiliated with it, saying in a
  statement: “We strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or
  other humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers.” In Lebanon,
  an Israeli drone strike targeted a car on the Haris–Hadatha road in the south
  of the country, killing one person, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.

Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US president Donald Trump had agreed to revive the contentious E1 settlement scheme – although there was no immediate confirmation from either leader. It comes after we reported earlier that Smotrich announced plans to begin construction on a settlement that would divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem. Qatar, Iraq and Jordan have all issued strong condemnations of recent statements concerning the occupied West Bank. In a statement from Doha on Thursday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns” Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich’s approval of plans to construct a settlement that would separate East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, calling it “a blatant violation of international legitimacy, particularly United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334”. Israeli advocacy group Peace Now has condemned plans to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law, the group said. The plans, announced by Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, approve tenders for more than 3,000 housing units in the controversial E1 settlement project between Jerusalem and Ma’ale Adumim in the West Bank. In an act of international journalistic solidarity, the Swedish Union of Journalists (SJF) staged a demonstration in Stockholm, protesting the targeted killings of Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The demonstration follows am Israeli airstrike on Sunday that claimed the lives of four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelance media workers sheltering near a tent outside the Al-Shifa Hospital. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has just issued its daily death toll. It says 54 people have been killed and 831 injured in the past 24 hours, adding that some victims remain under the rubble or on roads that ambulance and civil defence crews are unable to reach. Mossad spy chief David Barnea is visiting Qatar to revive Gaza peace talks, two Israeli officials told Reuters on Thursday. The visit follows a reported expression of eagerness by Hamas for a swift return to Gaza ceasefire negotiations during a meeting with Egypt’s intelligence chief in Cairo. Italy’s defence ministry says it has completed the largest medical evacuation from Gaza since January last year, flying 31 children and 83 accompanying relatives to Ciampino, Milan and Pisa overnight. The patients and their families have been admitted to Italian hospitals for medical care and specialist treatment. With this mission, Italy says it has now taken in more than 180 children from Gaza, along with 580 people in total, for treatment. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied accusations that Israel is committing genocide or intentionally starving civilians in Gaza, saying such claims are “false”.

In a statement carried by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Health Organisation says medical supply entry into Gaza remains “difficult and ever changing” despite the delivery of 80 trucks of supplies since June 25, when a suspension of more than three months was lifted. Riot police at Greece’s largest port, Piraeus, cordoned off an area around a cruise ship early Thursday to prevent several hundred protesters from approaching the vessel. The Crown Iris, carrying Israeli tourists, has faced demonstrations at Greek islands and mainland ports along its route, some of which have led to clashes with police. Human Rights Watch has described as “abhorrent” reports that the Israeli government is in talks with five countries – Indonesia, Somaliland, Uganda, South Sudan and Libya – about taking displaced Palestinians from Gaza. Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 reported on Wednesday that such discussions were taking place. The head of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) says he is working to reinstate a documentary about the October 7 attacks after its removal from the schedule sparked a public outcry in Israel. Cameron Bailey, TIFF’s CEO, said the Canadian film The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue was initially withdrawn due to issues surrounding “legal clearance of all footage”. Palestinians struggle to collect humanitarian aid airdropped by parachutes into Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, on Thursday. We are starting to see responses to Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich saying prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US president Donald Trump had agreed to revive the contentious E1 settlement scheme. Eropean Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said during a press briefing: The EU rejects any territorial change that is not part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation of territory is illegal under international law. Meanwhile, Norwegian foreign minister Espen Barth Eide said the move showed that Israel “seeks to appropriate land owned by Palestinians in order to prevent a two-state solution”. Qatar, which has mediated between Hamas and Israel in efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, condemned Smotrich’s actions as a “blatant violation of international law”. Human Rights Watch has described as “abhorrent” reports that the Israeli government is in talks with five countries – Indonesia, Somaliland, Uganda, South Sudan and Libya – about taking displaced Palestinians from Gaza. Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 reported on Wednesday that such discussions were taking place. Milena Ansari, Israel and Palestine assistant researcher at Human Rights Watch, told the Guardian: Hearing Israeli officials flaunt abhorrent plans to escalate forced displacement and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza should trigger outrage in the international community. Instead of standing beside a government whose Prime Minister is wanted for atrocity crimes by the International Criminal Court, states should make clear their categorical opposition to such actions and take concrete actions to prevent the extermination of Palestinians. Anything less will only magnify the possibility they could be held complicit in Israel’s crimes of forced displacement. The report came a day after the Associated Press said Israel had discussed sending Palestinians to South Sudan. The Israeli government has previously called for the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians from Gaza amid the ongoing war. Riot police at Greece’s largest port, Piraeus, cordoned off an area around a cruise ship early Thursday to prevent several hundred protesters from approaching the vessel. The Crown Iris, carrying Israeli tourists, has faced demonstrations at Greek islands and mainland ports along its route, some of which have led to clashes with police. At Piraeus, near Athens, demonstrators held flares and waved Palestinian flags behind a cordon formed with riot police buses. Protest organisers, citing online posts from travellers, claimed off-duty Israeli soldiers were among the passengers. “They are unwanted here and have no business being here,” protest organiser Markos Bekris said. “The blood of innocent people is on their hands, and we should not welcome them.” Greece remains a popular holiday destination for Israelis, but the ongoing war on Gaza, and global attention on the widespread destruction and severe food shortages, has sparked hundreds of anti-Israel protests in Athens and other Greek cities and towns. Opposition parties have called on the conservative government to halt commercial and military cooperation with Israel. In an act of international journalistic solidarity, the Swedish Union of Journalists (SJF) staged a demonstration in Stockholm, protesting the targeted killings of Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The demonstration follows am Israeli airstrike on Sunday that claimed the lives of four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelance media workers sheltering near a tent outside the Al-Shifa Hospital. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 192 journalists and media workers have been killed since the onset of the war in late 2023. In a statement shared on social media, SJF decried the ongoing violence against press freedoms as “unacceptable and must come to an end,” adding: “the message is simple – stop killing our colleagues”. Qatar, Iraq and Jordan have all issued strong condemnations of recent statements concerning the occupied West Bank. In a statement from Doha on Thursday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns” Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich’s approval of plans to construct a settlement that would separate East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, calling it “a blatant violation of international legitimacy, particularly United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334”. Iraq’s foreign ministry also “strongly condemns” remarks by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week in which he said he felt “very attached” to the vision of a so-called “Greater Israel”. The ministry described the comments as “a blatant provocation and a clear violation of the sovereignty of states, a breach of international law, and the charter of the United Nations”. Jordan’s foreign ministry criticised Smotrich’s announcement that he intends to approve tenders to build more than 3,000 homes in the E1 area settlement project linking Jerusalem to Maale Adumim. Its spokesperson, ambassador Sufyan Qudah, said the plan and other “illegal Israeli measures” were “a blatant violation of international law”. My colleague Peter Beaumont his written a fuller report on an earlier blog post on Aid groups saying that Israel’s new registration rules “are weaponising aid”: More than 100 aid organisations working in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have accused Israel of dangerously “weaponising aid” in its application of new rules for registering groups involved in delivering humanitarian assistance. The letter represents the latest broadside from the international aid community against Israel after the EU, Britain and Japan on Tuesday called for urgent action to stop “famine” spreading in the Gaza Strip. Mossad spy chief David Barnea is visiting Qatar to revive Gaza peace talks, two Israeli officials told Reuters on Thursday. The visit follows a reported expression of eagerness by Hamas for a swift return to Gaza ceasefire negotiations during a meeting with Egypt’s intelligence chief in Cairo. Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US president Donald Trump had agreed to revive the contentious E1 settlement scheme – although there was no immediate confirmation from either leader. It comes after we reported earlier that Smotrich announced plans to begin construction on a settlement that would divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem. Standing at the site in Ma’ale Adumim, Smotrich said: Whoever in the world is trying to recognise a Palestinian state today will receive our answer on the ground. Not with documents nor with decisions or statements, but with facts. Facts of houses, facts of neighbourhoods. Smotrich told Reuters the plan would go into effect on Wednesday, without specifying what would happen that day. Most of the international community considers all settlements illegal under international law, a position backed by multiple UN Security Council resolutions calling on Israel to halt settlement activity. In June, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Smotrich and another far-right minister who advocates settlement expansion, accusing them of repeatedly inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Palestinians mourn loved ones killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza Earlier we reported that Syria’s official Ekhbariya TV said an explosion had been heard in Idlib, in the north-west of the country. Syria’s state news agency is now reporting that at least four people were killed and five injured in an explosion on the outskirts of Idlib city on Thursday. An Iranian government spokesperson has compared Israel’s war in Gaza to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In a post on X, Esmaeil Baqaei, head of Iran’s Centre for Public Diplomacy, said: As the world marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, UN human rights experts have noted that Israel’s genocidal attacks evoke painful parallels with the nuclear attacks on Japan. Quoting a statement published by the UN human rights council, Baqaei added: “Of particular concern is Israel’s perpetration of these genocidal attacks, while it remains as the sole nuclear power in the Middle East, continuing to threaten regional stability with attacks against most of its neighbouring states, including attacks against nuclear facilities in Iran.” Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel has just provided some insight into the country’s post-war plans for Gaza. She said a non-Israeli, peaceful civilian administration for Gaza was among the government’s five key principles for ending the war. The other principles include the release of hostages still held in Gaza, the surrender of weapons by Hamas, the full demilitarization of Gaza, and Israel retaining overriding security controls, she added. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has just issued its daily death toll. It says 54 people have been killed and 831 injured in the past 24 hours, adding that some victims remain under the rubble or on roads that ambulance and civil defence crews are unable to reach. According to the ministry, the death toll from Israeli military action since 7 October 2023 has risen to 61,776, with 154,906 injured. Since 18 March 2025 when the ceasefire ended, it says 10,251 people have been killed and 42,865 injured. The ministry said 22 of those killed in the past day died in incidents involving aid convoys, along with 269 injuries, bringing the total number of what it calls “aid victims” to 1,881 dead and more than 13,863 injured since the start of the war. Earlier, the ministry also reported four deaths from famine and malnutrition in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 239, including 106 children. Italy’s defence ministry says it has completed the largest medical evacuation from Gaza since January last year, flying 31 children and 83 accompanying relatives to Ciampino, Milan and Pisa overnight. The patients and their families have been admitted to Italian hospitals for medical care and specialist treatment. With this mission, Italy says it has now taken in more than 180 children from Gaza, along with 580 people in total, for treatment. The ministry said Italy is the fourth country in the world, and the first among Western nations, for the evacuation and transfer of Palestinian patients to specialised hospitals. “In dramatic contexts like that of the Gaza Strip, solidarity is expressed through concrete actions rather than words,” defence minister Guido Crosetto said. “Today’s medical transport is a further sign of Italy’s commitment alongside the civilian population affected by a severe humanitarian emergency. Giving hope, saving a life, especially that of suffering children, means affirming the fundamental values we identify with.” Crosetto thanked the defence, foreign and interior ministries, Italy’s civil protection department, and the healthcare personnel caring for the young patients. Earlier we reported that Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to advance tenders for more than 3,000 housing units in the E1 settlement project between Jerusalem and Ma’ale Adumim – in what advocacy groups criticised as illegal under international law. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates has just issued a strong rebuke of the measures, calling the tenders as being linked to “the notion of ‘Greater Israel’” and part of a wider plan to “undermine the opportunity to establish the Palestinian state on its homeland”. It considers the colonial construction in the E1 area a continuation of the occupation’s plans to undermine the opportunity to establish the Palestinian state on its homeland, weaken its geographical and demographic unity, entrench the division of the West Bank into isolated areas surrounded by a sea of settlements, and facilitate the completion of their annexation. The Ministry views these tenders as an extension of the crimes of genocide, displacement, and annexation, and as an echo of Netanyahu’s statements regarding what he called ‘Greater Israel’. It called for “genuine international intervention” and sanctions to halt the plans, end the “genocide, displacement, and annexation”. Human Rights Watch (HRW) says Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s Evin prison in June killed scores of detainees, visitors and staff in what it has described as an “apparent war crime”. The rights group says survivors have since been subjected to abuse, enforced disappearances and inhumane detention conditions by Iranian authorities. The investigation, based on satellite imagery, videos and witness accounts, found the 23 June strikes destroyed visitation halls, prison wards, the central kitchen, the medical clinic and administrative offices. HRW said it found no evidence of military targets in the facility, which held more than 1,500 prisoners at the time, many jailed for peaceful activism. Turning briefly to Syria, a UN investigation has found that war crimes were likely committed by both members of the interim government forces and fighters loyal to the country’s former rulers during an outbreak of sectarian violence in the coastal region in March. The UN Syria Commission of Inquiry says around 1,400 people – mainly civilians from Alawi communities – were killed in the violence, which included torture, killings and inhumane treatment of the dead. The coastal incidents were the worst violence to hit Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last year. Meanwhile, fighting elsewhere in the country continues. An explosion was reported in Idlib on Thursday, with authorities working to verify its cause. Turkey has also just signed a military cooperation accord with Syria, pledging weapons systems, logistical support and training. The Turkish defence ministry said the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – the Kurdish-led force allied with the US in the fight against ISIS – have yet to meet conditions for integration into Syria’s state apparatus under a March agreement, and urged compliance. Despite the deal, skirmishes have continued. Syria’s state news agency SANA reported a government soldier was killed earlier this week in clashes with the SDF in Aleppo province. In a surviving upstairs room at Gaza College, its walls pocked with shrapnel and windows blown out, a boy sits for a guitar class. His teacher, Mohammed Abu Mahadi, 32, says music can help heal the psychological wounds left by bombardment, loss and shortages. “What I do here is make children happy from music because it is one of the best ways for expressing feelings,” he said. The students were attending an Edward Said National Conservatory of Music lesson on 4 August, held in displacement camps and damaged buildings since Israeli strikes forced the school from its main base. “When I play I feel like I’m flying away,” said Rifan al-Qassas, 15, who began learning the oud at nine. “Music gives me hope and eases my fear.” Founded in the West Bank, the conservatory opened its Gaza branch 13 years ago. But after 22 months of war, some students are now dead, including 14-year-old violinist Lubna Alyaan. The old school building now lies in ruins, its walls collapsed and rooms littered with debris. A grand piano is gone. For many, music is now the last place of refuge. The health ministry in Gaza has just issued a statement, saying four more people have died from famine and malnutrition in the past 24 hours. This brings the total to 239 since the start of the war, including 106 children, according to the health ministry. It warned that shortages of food and clean water, combined with the collapse of health services, are driving a worsening hunger crisis across the territory. The head of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) says he is working to reinstate a documentary about the October 7 attacks after its removal from the schedule sparked a public outcry in Israel. Cameron Bailey, TIFF’s CEO, said the Canadian film The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue was initially withdrawn due to issues surrounding “legal clearance of all footage”. However, in a statement published on X last night, Bailey said his “intention was to screen” the film and described it as “an important story” that adds to the festival’s “rich tapestry of perspectives”. Bailey rejected claims of censorship as “unequivocally false” and urged “patience and understanding”. The documentary follows Noam Tibon, who set out to rescue his son, journalist Amir Tibon, and his family during the attack on Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Its removal drew protests from Israel’s foreign ministry and the Canadian Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs. Eight Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in central Gaza and northwest of Gaza City, according to medical sources, cited by Wafa news agency. Staff at Al-Aqsa hospital said three people died when an Israeli drone fired a missile at a group of civilians in the al-Hakr area, south of Deir al-Balah. The Palestinian news agency also reported that Israeli drones also targeted a group of people northwest of Gaza City, killing five and injuring others. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied accusations that Israel is committing genocide or intentionally starving civilians in Gaza, saying such claims are “false”. In a video posted to the Israeli prime minister’s YouTube channel, speaking at the US Independence Day reception hosted by Newsmax in Jerusalem , Netanyahu said: The first false accusation is genocide. The second false accusation is starvation. From the first second day of the war, we said there has to be another separation between civilians and combatants and that is that we supply humanitarian aid. If we had a starvation policy, everybody in Gaza would be dead. But that’s not our policy. Netanyahu said diplomacy was “just another way to say defeat and surrender”, adding: “Victory” was “the last word left in the army’s lexicon”. He also told the audience: “Americans recognise that Israel stands for the same values as America. They recognise that we are fighting the barbarians at the gate … not only the goal of destroying Israel, it’s even the method that they use to murder and mutilate the heathen, as they call them.” We are just receiving pictures via the wires from inside Nasser Medical Complex, a hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. In a statement carried by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Health Organisation says medical supply entry into Gaza remains “difficult and ever changing” despite the delivery of 80 trucks of supplies since June 25, when a suspension of more than three months was lifted. Many critical items, including ICU beds, anaesthesia machines and cold chain medicines, have been denied entry, while clearance processes for goods arriving via Ben Gurion Airport remain slow, the statement said. WHO said it has delivered 6,000 blood units to Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, but these are only a fraction of what is needed as health facilities face mass casualty incidents and rising cases of infectious disease. Shortages of fuel for generators and spare parts are also crippling the 230 health points still partially functional across Gaza, the statement said. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has just issued a warning on X, saying that soaring temperatures in Gaza are now above 40°C, making an already dire humanitarian situation “far worse”. “With very limited water available, dehydration is increasing,” the agency said in a post on X. It added that bombardments and forced displacement continue, while limited electricity and fuel mean there is “no relief from the extreme heat”. UNRWA reiterated its call for an immediate ceasefire. Israeli advocacy group Peace Now has condemned plans to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law, the group said. The plans, announced by Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, approve tenders for more than 3,000 housing units in the controversial E1 settlement project between Jerusalem and Ma’ale Adumim in the West Bank. Smotrich said in a statement cited by the Times of Israel: Approval of construction plans in E1 buries the idea of a Palestinian state and continues the many steps we are taking on the ground as part of the de facto sovereignty plan that we began implementing with the establishment of the government. After decades of international pressure and freezes, we are breaking conventions and connecting Ma’ale Adumim to Jerusalem. This is Zionism at its best – building, settling and strengthening our sovereignty in the Land of Israel. The E1 plan has been frozen for decades amid strong opposition from the international community, which warns it would divide the West Bank into northern and southern regions, and prevent the development of a Palestinian urban area linking East Jerusalem with Bethlehem and Ramallah. Peace Now said in a statement: “The E1 plan is deadly for the future of Israel and for any chance of achieving a peaceful two-state solution. We are standing at the edge of an abyss, and the government is driving us forward at full speed.” More than 100 international NGOs have accused Israel of using humanitarian aid as a weapon in Gaza, saying most major agencies have been unable to deliver a single truck of supplies since early March. Despite Israeli authorities claiming there is no limit on humanitarian aid entering the territory, the groups say dozens of requests to bring in food, medicine, water and shelter items have been rejected on the grounds that the organisations are “not authorized to deliver aid”. In July alone, more than 60 requests were denied, according to the statement. The aid backlog has left millions of dollars’ worth of goods stranded in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt, while hospitals run short of basic supplies and civilians die from hunger and preventable illnesses. Many of the affected organisations say they have worked in Gaza for decades. The groups link the obstruction to new registration rules introduced in March, which allow Israeli authorities to reject applications based on vague criteria such as alleged “delegitimisation” of the state. Agencies say the process is being used to control independent organisations and censor humanitarian reporting. “Since the full siege was imposed on 2 March, CARE has not been able to deliver any of our $1.5m worth of pre-positioned supplies into Gaza,” said Jolien Veldwijk, CARE’s country director. Oxfam said it has over $2.5m worth of goods blocked from entering. The signatories called on governments and donors to press Israel to end the restrictions, demand the opening of all land crossings, and ensure agencies can operate without compromising independence or staff safety. The Israeli military says the missile was fired overnight. In a statement posted on X, it said: “The Air Force intercepted one missile launched from Yemen; according to policy, no alerts were activated.” A Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, later claimed the group had targeted Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv “using a hypersonic ballistic missile”. Houthi rebels in Yemen have regularly launched missile and drone attacks on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has previously carried out strikes on areas under Houthi control, including ports in western Yemen and Sanaa airport. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Gaza. At least 123 people have been killed and 437 injured in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health authorities. Hospitals also reported that eight people – including three children – died from starvation and malnutrition during the same period, bringing the total number of such deaths to 235, among them 106 children. The number of aid convoy victims recorded in the past day reached 21 dead and 185 injured, according to officials, bringing the total number killed in such incidents since the start of the war to 1,859, with more than 13,594 injured. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), described the starvation deaths as the latest in the “war on children” in Gaza. The Israeli military said its chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, has approved the “main concept” for a new attack plan in the Gaza Strip, without giving further details. Reuters reports the decision comes after a rift between Israel’s political leadership and its military commanders. A Hamas official accused Israeli forces of making “aggressive” incursions into Gaza City on Wednesday after news of the plan’s approval. “The Israeli occupation forces continue to carry out aggressive incursions in Gaza City,” said Ismail Al-Thawabta, director general of the Hamas government media office. The Israeli military also said it struck a group of militants in Gaza disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of international charity World Central Kitchen. The charity confirmed that neither the men nor the vehicle were affiliated with it, saying in a statement: “We strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or other humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers.” In Lebanon, an Israeli drone strike targeted a car on the Haris–Hadatha road in the south of the country, killing one person, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. We’ll bring you all the latest developments throughout the day.
