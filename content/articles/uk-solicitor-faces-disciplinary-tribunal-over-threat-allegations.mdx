  A solicitor at one of Britain’s best known libel law firms is facing
  prosecution before a disciplinary tribunal over allegations that she made an
  inappropriate threat. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) announced
  today it had decided to prosecute Claire Gill, a partner at Carter-Ruck. The
  decision was taken in March earlier this year. In a statement published on its
  website the SRA said that a tribunal “has certified that there is a case to
  answer in respect of allegations which are or include that, on or around 26
  April 2017, Ms Gill sent or arranged to be sent correspondence which contained
  an improper threat of litigation”. It added that the allegations were subject
  to a full hearing and were as yet unproven. SRA cases are heard by the
  independent Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which can issue an unlimited
  fine or bar a solicitor from the profession. Carter-Ruck as a firm is not
  being prosecuted by the SRA. The nature of the threat, and the identity of the
  client on whose behalf Gill issued it, are not stated in the SRA announcement.
  However, it is understood that the case relates to Gill’s work for OneCoin,
  which was later established to be a multibillion-dollar fake cryptocurrency,
  and its founder, Ruja Ignatova. In 2023 the Bureau of Investigative Journalism
  reported on threats from Carter-Ruck on behalf of OneCoin and Ignatova,
  including a letter sent on 26 April 2017 to Jen McAdam, a OneCoin victim. The
  letter was obtained and published by the thinktank Tax Policy Associates and
  its founder, Dan Neidle, who complained about Gill to the SRA. In the letter
  published by Neidle, Gill accused McAdam of posting links to online videos
  alleging that OneCoin was a fraud. “The statements you have published … go way
  beyond what may be considered to be legitimate debate,” Gill wrote to McAdam.
  “You can be in no doubt therefore of the damage being caused to our clients’
  reputation and business.” In a statement Carter-Ruck said: “We are
  disappointed by the SRA’s decision to bring these proceedings against our
  colleague, who we will be fully supporting in her defence of this matter.”
  McAdam posted on X that she was unable to comment. The case comes amid public
  concern about so-called strategic litigation against public participation, or
  “slapp”, actions involving lawyers being accused of trying to improperly
  stifle public debate on behalf of clients. Ignatova, a Bulgarian national, was
  the subject of the BBC’s podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen, which chronicled the
  evolution and eventual collapse of the OneCoin fraud and the search for the
  mysterious Ignatova, who vanished in 2018. Ignatova remains wanted by the FBI
  in connection with OneCoin, and a reward has been offered for information
  leading to her arrest or conviction. She was charged with fraud and
  money-laundering offences in the US in 2018, but her whereabouts remain
  unknown. In 2024 the BBC reported on claims published in the Bulgarian press
  that the true masterminds of the fraud were members of the Bulgarian mafia,
  and that Ignatova could have been murdered, dismembered and dumped in the
  Ionian Sea after the mafia considered her to have become a liability.
