  Lucy Letby: Who to Believe? review – just when you thought this case couldn’t
  get any more confusing …

  In May 2024, the New Yorker published an article with the headline “A British
  nurse was found guilty of killing seven babies. Did she do it?” Access to the
  online version of Rachel Aviv’s piece was banned in the UK due to reporting
  restrictions, with Letby’s retrial on an additional count of attempted murder
  then imminent. Rules aside, asking whether Letby was in fact innocent also
  felt taboo at the time, a pursuit for social media conspiracy theorists. Fast
  forward 15 months, and “did she do it?” is merely par for the course when it
  comes to the case, with even experts cited by the prosecution apparently
  unconvinced of Letby’s guilt. This new Panorama comes hot on the heels of an
  ITV documentary that aired earlier this month, Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable
  Doubt?. That programme focused on holes in the evidence that was presented to
  the jury who found Letby guilty of killing seven babies and attempting to kill
  seven more at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016. Hers had
  been, said Neena Modi, a professor of neonatal medicine, a “deeply disturbing”
  trial based on flawed evidence. Claims made in the trial were roundly
  rubbished by a panel of specialists who reviewed the case, and by experts
  found by the programme makers, making the evidence sound more like a series of
  sad anomalies than conclusive proof of wrongdoing by Letby. In any case, one
  would be unlikely to come away from that programme without at least a measure
  of doubt about her convictions. And yet, many other doubts do persist, leading
  – one fears – to a continued stream of programmes about the case. This is the
  third instalment of Panorama that Judith Moritz has made about Letby; the
  first, released in 2023, was subtitled The Nurse Who Killed, another last year
  was named Unanswered Questions, and now, in keeping with the rising sense of
  uncertainty, we have Who to Believe?. Like the ITV documentary, it considers
  the limitations of the evidence that put the 35-year-old behind bars. Unlike
  that documentary, though, it also considers whether the alternative version of
  events put forward by experts such as Modi and Shoo Lee – who rebutted the
  prosecution’s interpretation of his work on air embolisms – holds water. It is
  a muddled hour of television, in which Moritz and producer-director Jonathan
  Coffey (who have also written a book about the case together) describe various
  things as conjecture, before supplying more conjecture of their own, and
  ultimately concluding that it’s a right old mess. It certainly wouldn’t be
  right to take the ITV documentary – or any other for that matter – as the
  ultimate authority on the case. But this Panorama seems to add very little in
  the way of conclusive information. Take, for example, this lightly heated
  exchange between Moritz and Coffey, who are discussing whether or not it is
  significant that the prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Dewi Evans, changed his
  mind on one of the babies’ cause of death, from air pumped into the stomach to
  an intravenous air embolism. Moritz: “It’s not like you had a situation where
  [someone was] saying, this person was shot … actually, no sorry, there’s no
  gunshot wounds at all, I’ve decided instead they drowned.” Coffey: “Some
  people would say that’s exactly what we’re dealing with here.” Moritz: “It’s
  certainly a difficult case to get your head around.” Coffey: “Well, some
  people would say it’s not a difficult case to get your head around, that
  actually they have got their head around it and the prosecution expert
  evidence is all over the place.” Moritz: “Yeah – and other people would say
  they got their head around it and convicted her!” It’s more like a drivetime
  phone-in than serious investigative journalism. Clearly, Moritz and Coffey
  care about the case, and about finding out whether Letby has indeed been
  wrongfully convicted. But in an investigation remarkable for the sheer number
  of theories involved – and now counter-theories – the addition of
  counter-counter-theories is hard to compute. A long tangent into the death of
  one child – Baby O – and how he may or may not have sustained injuries to his
  liver, only underscores the lack of consensus among experts, and the
  possibility of falling down rabbitholes at every turn. Similarly, inflated
  insulin levels in Baby F and Baby L lead to wildly different interpretations
  depending on who is explaining it all. We are told that the immunoassay tests
  that were used during the trial were highly unreliable, and shouldn’t have
  been relied on in court. And yet, we also hear that those levels of insulin
  just cannot be explained away. Unless, of course, the tests were wrong …? And
  around and around we go. In determinedly not taking any claims at face value,
  Who to Believe? will surely confuse viewers even more, and brings us no closer
  to understanding whether there is indeed a compelling alternative to the
  events set out by the prosecution. It concludes that Letby was either
  “spectacularly bad” at her job or this was a major miscarriage of justice.
  Taking us right back to where we started. • Lucy Letby: Who to Believe? aired
  on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.
