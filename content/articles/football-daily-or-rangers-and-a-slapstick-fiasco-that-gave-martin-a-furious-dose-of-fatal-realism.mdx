  RAN-GRRRS Football Daily would never publicly admit that our life is so
  meaningless, empty and utterly devoid of purpose that we occasionally spend
  our leisure time perusing the fan forums of random clubs with whom we have no
  affiliation just to pass the time. No, that would be embarrassing so it was
  purely in the interests of diligent professional research that we spent the
  buildup to one of last night’s Bigger Cup qualifiers scrutinising the long
  pre-match thread on a forum devoted to one fitba club in particular, all the
  better to gauge the mood among Rangers fans before their first leg against
  Club Brugge. Before a ball had been kicked, it was one of cautious optimism
  that was quickly replaced by fatal realism and no end of radge-induced
  McEffing and McJeffing a mere three minutes after kick-off. That’s how long it
  took for the hesitant-to-the-point-of-slumbering Rangers duo Nasser Djiga and
  Jack Butland to contrive to concede a goal so slapstick (but beautifully
  finished) that it would be worth resurrecting A Question of Sport for one
  final episode of What Happened Next? A game that started badly for Rangers
  quickly slalomed downhill faster than Franz Klammer and after just 20 minutes
  a steady stream of irate fans could be seen heading for the Ibrox exits after
  watching their team go 3-0 down. Having already witnessed Rangers lurch and
  stumble through their opening two qualifiers like a drunk on his way home
  after a night at The Fist &amp; Lizard, they had clearly seen enough and
  decided that, for this season at least, their team’s Bigger Cup jig and the
  £40m+ windfall that comes with it is almost certainly up. A second-half goal
  from Danilo took the bare look off Rangers’ side of the scoreboard and left
  their fans with that nagging feeling of faint hope that makes fools of us all
  but Ally McCoist gave his former side little more than a snowman’s chance in
  hell of turning the tie around when discussing last night’s fiasco on the
  wireless. “On that first-half performance, they couldn’t beat anybody to be
  honest,” he sighed. “To have any chance they’ve got to score first, that’s for
  sure but even I as the eternal optimist think it’ll be a big struggle.” While
  the crowd at Ibrox had already made their mind up about Russell Martin before
  this game, it remains to be seen how long Rangers, who have recently burned
  through managers at a rate that would make even the Watford owners balk, will
  be prepared to keep him on board in the face of such obvious fan fury. The
  first appointment of the club’s new owners, 49ers Enterprises, Martin faced
  the obligatory questions from the press afterwards from behind a table bearing
  several bottles of Bigger Cup-sanctioned Crocodile Drink which he did his best
  to view as half-full. “That’s as hard as it will ever be for the players on
  the pitch,” he blathered of the opening 20 minutes. “I’m proud of how they
  responded. They all displayed courage in the second half. We recovered
  properly and we hurt them as much as they hurt us. That goal changes
  everything.” In the unlikely event they exist, more level-headed Rangers fans
  will almost certainly concede their team simply does not have good enough
  players to avoid the humiliations that unlikely qualification for Bigger Cup
  will surely bring and with a consolation place in Bigger Vase already assured,
  their club’s future on the continent is not entirely bleak. However,
  regardless of where or who they play, there is widespread frustration over
  Martin’s team selections, player acquisitions and tactics after just eight
  games. The 39-year-old said he hoped to be “judged in May”, but the fact of
  the matter is the majority of the Ibrox jury reached their verdict before his
  appointment in June. QUOTE OF THE DAY I’m not at the [PFA awards] ceremony
  tonight. With everything going on, it didn’t feel right to be there. I’ve kept
  quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed
  people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn’t
  reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors. The reality is
  that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To
  now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. When promises are
  broken and trust is lost the relationship can’t continue. That’s where things
  are for me right now – and why change is in the best interests of everyone,
  not just myself” – the Alexander Isak transfer saga goes on (and on, and on),
  with the striker sounding like he’s almost at the stage where he’s going to
  write a painful breakup album if his latest Instachat post is anything to go
  by. Newcastle have been quick to fire back: “We are clear in response that
  Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a
  club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer.” Make it end!
   FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Football can be a pleasing source of anagrams. Is Pep
  Guardiola’s eternal youth down to synthetic cream (Manchester City)? After
  years in the doldrums, Lilywhites fans are now Sudden Elite (Leeds United).
  Carlisle United’s slow demise looks like Ritual Declines? Meanwhile, the foul
  atmosphere emanating from Alexander Isak’s claim that he was promised he could
  move to a bigger club may lead one to suspect this ‘is a rank ex-deal’. And of
  course, Brugge seem poised to thoroughly anagram Rangers’ Bigger Cup
  ambitions. I would get out more but I’m too busy watching Countdown” – Mark
  McFadden. Newcastle sporting director: ‘Well, we’ll just play Callum. Wait …
  where is Callum? In fact, where am I?” – Joe Skupien. May I be the first –
  although I’m probably not – to start a campaign to either rename the offence
  to hand/arm ball or limit the offence to just the hand. Surely the intent is
  to stop players controlling (handling) the ball so why is using the arm
  penalised? You can use your knee, chest, stomach or posterior so why not your
  arm?” – Nick Smyth. Wolfsburg (yesterday’s Memory Lane – full email edition)
  have never had the same allure since they told manager Wolfgang Wolf to do
  one” – Jon Harris. If you have any, please send letters to
  the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is
  … Mark McFadden. Terms and conditions for our competitions, when we run them,
  can be viewed here.   RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join Max
  Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson,
  Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry
  at Troxy in London. The pod will also be livestreamed globally. Book now.
