  Nova Twins: Parasites & Butterflies review – fearless rock duo balance anthems
  and introspection

  Nova Twins’ 2022 album Supernova received Brit nominations and the first ever
  Mercury prize shortlisting for a Black rock band, and earned singer/guitarist
  Amy Love and bassist Georgia South fans in Rage Against the Machine and Elton
  John. Their third album packs more of the trademark hybrid of rock, metal,
  punk and hip-hop that elbowed them to the front of a still male-dominated
  genre, but pushes at their boundaries and tiptoes towards pop. Working with
  Foo Fighters/Charli xcx producer Rich Costey and a supporting cast including
  former Nine Inch Nails drummer Ilan Rubin and (via their first use of
  sampling) Iranian singer Mahsa Vahdat, the sound is bigger and more blatantly
  anthemic. Soprano playfully flirts with sugary harmonies and semi-operatic
  pop. Hummingbird – a kaleidoscopic collage of multi-layered vocals, unusual
  guitar processing and inventive percussion – sums up their spirit of
  adventure: “Spread your wings.” Lyrically, there’s more openness and
  introspection. Parallel Universe allows a glimpse of the toll on mental health
  of years in the business: “You loathe all the things you hide within
  yourself,” Love sings. The particularly anthemic Monsters still packs the
  attitude that saw off the naysayers who think this kind of music should not be
  made by young Black women, but adds vulnerability: “I’m not afraid of
  monsters, but I’m afraid of myself.” Elsewhere, tracks such as Piranha still
  ramp up the brutally catchy riffola and big grooves. Longstanding fans can be
  assured that the Twins rock as hard as ever, just in a different way.
