  It is commonly known these days as the Luke Littler effect. A teenage
  phenomenon bursting on to the scene and almost becoming a bigger force of
  nature than the sport he or she was born to succeed in. But while darts is
  only experiencing that boom now, snooker has tasted this sensation before. In
  the 1990s, it was Ronnie O’Sullivan’s arrival on the baize as a teenager that
  revitalised snooker’s fortunes in the UK. In the mid-2000s, Ding Junhui’s
  emergence led to the explosion of the game in China – which has just produced
  its first world champion in the shape of Zhao Xintong, one of millions who was
  inspired to pick up a cue by Ding. But it is not unreasonable to suggest that
  in the UK, snooker is in desperate need of its own Luke Littler effect once
  again. The sport still relies heavily on players such as O’Sullivan – who
  turns 50 this year – for mainstream attention. There have been moments, but
  nothing in the way of a seismic shifting of British snooker’s tectonic plates.
  Perhaps that is where Halifax’s Stan Moody comes in. Like Littler, Moody was
  obsessed with his sport of choice from a young age, after picking up a cue to
  play pool as a nine-year-old on a family holiday. And like the darts prodigy,
  he has already enjoyed immense success belying his years, turning professional
  at 16 and winning national championships at under-14, under-16 and under-18
  level. Impressively, Moody retained his tour card at the end of last season
  despite only being 18 and this week he enjoyed the best run of his career so
  far, reaching the quarter-finals of the Wuhan Open. Along the way he beat Ding
  and Barry Hawkins to pick up a cheque for £16,000. “I’ve made a lot of
  progress, I feel so much better under pressure now,” Moody says. He is now
  climbing the rankings and has already been tipped for big things by Jimmy
  White. The challenge for snooker? Selling this story and achieving a similar
  ripple effect to the one darts has enjoyed with Littler; not so much at the
  elite level, but at grassroots, with more youngsters playing darts than ever
  before in the wake of his rise. “It’s a wonderful story,” Jason Ferguson, the
  chair of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, says. “Not
  every child wants to play football in England or rugby. He fell in love with
  cue sports at nine, which I can relate to myself. Nine is very young to have
  got really hooked on it and now he’s knocking on the door of the very elite
  end of the sport.” But perhaps it was fitting that Moody’s best run of his
  burgeoning career to date came in China, where the sport has now left the UK
  behind. There are more than 300,000 snooker halls across the country, it is on
  the national curriculum and most of the sport’s premier up-and-coming talent
  is Chinese. Moody is an outlier; so how does snooker change that? “It needs
  help from the government,” Moody’s father, Nigel, explains. “Stan just
  happened to pick up a cue by luck. There’s only really been Ronnie in the last
  30 years outside of that who’s made such a huge impact. If you got every child
  in a school to pick up a cue, how many Stans could there be out there? “It’s
  got to get into schools. In China they’ve been doing that for 20 years.” Moody
  himself says. “In China it’s really different to at home. They’re obsessed
  with it.” Ferguson has long spoken of his desire to get snooker recognised
  more in the UK – but he is hopeful that a breakthrough talent like Moody will
  start to make more people notice. “For me it’s a great thing to see a young
  man from England providing that inspiration,” he says. “He will inspire
  another generation. He’s been on the BBC, and moving to this new level in his
  career, he can help people pay attention to snooker. It just takes one. We
  opened an Asian academy in 1999 and I remember Ding walking through the door.
  “You need big stars in a sporting market and there’s no doubt Stan is becoming
  one of those names people will follow. Look at the confidence it can hopefully
  put into juniors in snooker. He’s in the top 64 players in the world and
  rising, and beating big names on a regular basis now.” But that is a problem
  for Ferguson and snooker’s authorities, not for the undeniably talented Moody,
  who is looking upwards and aiming to take more big scalps over the coming
  months. “This tournament has confirmed what I can do, but I want to go further
  and do that in every tournament and hopefully win one,” he says. The talent is
  there, and the Yorkshire teenager is clearly set for a bright future. The
  question is whether snooker as a whole can find a path to take full advantage
  of Moody’s potential and position him as a star the sport can build around for
  years to come.
