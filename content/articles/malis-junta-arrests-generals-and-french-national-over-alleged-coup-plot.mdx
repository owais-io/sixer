  Mali’s military rulers say they have arrested a group of military personnel
  and civilians, including two Malian generals and a suspected French agent,
  accusing them of attempting to destabilise the country. The security minister,
  Gen Daouda Aly Mohammedine, who announced the arrests on the local evening
  news on Thursday, told viewers an investigation was under way and that the
  situation was “completely under control”. Sources told the Reuters and Agence
  France-Presse agencies earlier this week that dozens of military officials had
  been taken into custody. The development comes as the military continues to
  crack down on dissent after a pro-democracy rally in May, the first since
  soldiers seized power nearly four years ago. Few details were provided about
  the alleged coup plotters, what they had intended or the French national
  implicated in it, beyond identifying him as Yann Vezilier. Mohammedine said he
  had been acting “on behalf of the French intelligence service, which mobilised
  political leaders, civil society actors and military personnel” in Mali. Some
  reports in Mali have identified Vezilier as a flight officer who was listed on
  the French government website Légifrance as a lieutenant colonel as of 2020.
  There was no immediate word from France, Mali’s former colonial ruler, on
  Vezilier’s arrest. “The transitional government informs the national public of
  the arrest of a small group of marginal elements of the Malian armed and
  security forces for criminal offences aimed at destabilising the institutions
  of the republic,” Mohammedine said. “The conspiracy has been foiled with the
  arrests of those involved.” A national television channel broadcast photos of
  11 people it said were members of the group that planned the coup, and
  Mohammedine identified two generals he accused of being part of the plot,
  which he said had begun on 1 August. One of them, Gen Abass Dembélé, is a
  former governor of the central Mopti region. He was abruptly dismissed in May,
  when he demanded an investigation into allegations that the army had killed
  civilians in the village of Diafarabé. The other, Gen Néma Sagara, was lauded
  for her role in fighting militants in 2012. Rida Lyammouri, an analyst at the
  Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, told Associated Press Mali’s
  rulers were well aware of discontent among the population and members of the
  military. “The military leaders are simply not willing to let those grievances
  build into something more, like a coup, and therefore these arrests seem more
  of a way to intimidate than a legitimate coup attempt,” he said. “It’s a
  continuation of the repeated unjustified arrests and prosecution of anyone
  speaking against the current regime. We have seen this behaviour against
  journalists, civil society and political leaders, so it’s not surprising to
  see this against military members.” Mali, along with neighbouring Burkina Faso
  and Niger, has long fought an insurgency by armed militants, including some
  allied with al-Qaida and Islamic State. After two military coups, the ruling
  junta expelled French troops in 2022 and turned to Russia for security
  assistance. But the security situation remains precarious, and attacks by
  militants have intensified in recent months. Gen Assimi Goïta was granted
  another five years in power in June, despite the junta’s earlier promises of a
  return to civilian rule by March 2024. The move followed the military’s
  dissolution of political parties in May.
