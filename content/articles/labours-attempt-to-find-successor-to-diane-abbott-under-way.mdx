  Moves to find a successor to Diane Abbott in the parliamentary seat she has
  represented since 1987 are under way, prompting concern that her fate has been
  decided before an investigation into her latest suspension has concluded.
  Figures on Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) have spoken to
  potential contenders, teeing them up for a future contest in her constituency
  of Hackney North and Stoke Newington, and giving them informal advice on how
  to prepare, according to a party source. Abbott was suspended from the party
  in July for repeating that Jewish people do not experience racism in the same
  way as Black people, a statement that had earned her a previous suspension in
  April 2023. Labour said there would be no discussion of potential successor as
  an investigation was ongoing. The party said there had been no discussions
  about alternative candidates at any NEC meetings and no proposals put to NEC
  members about a selection process. Abbott said: “It does seem to be rather
  pre-empting the results of the investigation.” One figure on the left of the
  party said talk of replacing Abbott risked inflaming tensions between the
  leadership and grassroots members. “There’s no appetite among members for a
  stitch-up, they would want this to be fair after everything that’s happened,”
  they said. Abbott, who as the longest-serving female MP has the honorary title
  of mother of the house, lost the Labour whip in autumn 2023 after she wrote a
  letter to the Observer in which she argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller
  people did not experience racism in the same way as Black people and likened
  their experience to that of people with red hair. Abbott said the letter
  published was a draft version, and that her comments had been taken out of
  context. She was readmitted to the party in time to retain her seat at the
  general election, but was suspended again last month after telling the BBC in
  an interview that she did not regret the remarks. The Guardian understands
  that potential successors to Abbott include those who were in the frame to
  replace before general election, among them the London assembly member Sem
  Moema and the Hackney councillor Mete Coban. Abbott’s latest suspension caused
  unease among some party insiders, including NEC members, but they said her
  decision to repeat her original comments, despite previously apologising, made
  it harder for them to defend her. Labour sources have briefed that Abbott is
  unlikely to be readmitted to the parliamentary Labour party. It is thought
  that she plans to stand down at the next election, if not sooner. Sources
  close to the process said discussions about a potential successor are too
  important to be left to the last minute. Under party rules, a suspended MP is
  barred from standing as a candidate until their case is resolved. The NEC has
  the power to trigger a selection process if a sitting MP is not endorsed to
  stand again. The row over Abbott’s future comes as Labour prepares for its
  autumn conference. The disciplinary process over Abbott’s original Observer
  letter became one of the longest and most prominent internal rows of Keir
  Starmer’s leadership. Allies accused party leaders of deliberately dragging
  their feet to prevent her re-selection, while Labour HQ insisted the
  investigation was handled according to the rules. The seat is regarded as
  ultra-safe for Labour, even although her majority last year was halved to
  15,000 last year amid a challenge from the Greens.
