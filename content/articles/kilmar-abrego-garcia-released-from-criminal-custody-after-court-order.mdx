  Kilmar Ábrego García has been freed on Friday from criminal custody in
  Tennessee so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on
  human smuggling charges, after a court ordered his release. Magistrate judge
  Barbara Holmes issued an order allowing the father of two to leave custody for
  the first time since his return to the US in June, following his wrongful
  deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. In a statement following his
  release, Ábrego’s lawyer, Sean Hecker said: “Today, Kilmar Ábrego García is
  free. He is presently en route to his family in Maryland, after being
  unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the
  government’s vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back
  against the administration’s continuing assault on the rule of law. He is
  grateful that his access to American courts has provided meaningful due
  process.” Ábrego entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager
  after fleeing gang violence. He was subsequently afforded a federal protection
  order against deportation to El Salvador. The 30-year-old was initially
  deported by federal immigration officials in March. Though the Trump
  administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation was an “administrative
  error,” officials have repeatedly accused Ábrego of being affiliated with the
  MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny. During his
  detention at El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot),
  Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured, according to court
  documents filed by his lawyers in July. Following Ábrego’s wrongful
  deportation, the Trump administration faced widespread pressure to return him
  to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal
  officials to “facilitate” his return. In June, the Trump administration
  returned Ábrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with crimes related to
  human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His
  criminal trial is expected to begin in January. Before his deportation, Ábrego
  had lived in Maryland for more than a decade, working in construction while
  being married to an American wife. In a court filing this week, his lawyers
  stated that they had hired a “private security firm that has experience
  providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in
  criminal cases” to transport Ábrego from Tennessee to Maryland.
