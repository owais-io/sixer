  Booking.com is facing a class-action lawsuit from more than 10,000 European
  hotels arguing that the accommodation mega-site used its muscle to distort the
  market to their detriment over a 20-year period. The Association of Hotels,
  Restaurants and Cafes in Europe (Hotrec), which represents the industry within
  the EU and is bringing the legal action, recently extended to 29 August a
  deadline for hotel owners to join the suit because of high demand. The
  lawsuit, expected to be one of the largest ever filed in the European
  hospitality sector, is also backed by 30 national hotel associations,
  including Britain’s. “Over 10,000 hotels have already joined the pan-European
  initiative to claim compensation for financial losses caused by Booking.com’s
  use of illegal ‘best price’ (parity) clauses,” Hotrec said in a statement. It
  alleges that the “best price” pledge on Booking.com was extracted from hotels
  under huge pressure not to offer rooms at lower prices on other platforms,
  including their own websites. The hotel industry says that the
  Netherlands-based platform also used the clauses to prevent customers making
  what it called “free-rider” bookings, which it defined as using its services
  to find a hotel but then booking directly with the management, cutting out
  Booking.com. “Registration [to the legal action] continues to grow steadily,
  and the response so far demonstrates the hospitality industry’s strong desire
  to stand up against unfair practices in the digital marketplace,” Hotrec said.
  The litigation, which experts say will be an uphill battle, seeks damages for
  the period from 2004 to 2024, when Booking.com did away with the best price
  clause to comply with the EU Digital Markets Act. Hotrec said the class
  action, to be heard in Amsterdam, follows a European court of justice (ECJ)
  ruling from 2024, “which found that Booking.com’s parity clauses violated EU
  competition law”. “European hoteliers have long suffered from unfair
  conditions and excessive costs. Now is the time to stand together and demand
  redress,” said Hotrec’s president, Alexandros Vassilikos, calling out “abusive
  practices in the digital market” in Europe. Booking.com called Hotrec and
  other hotel associations’ statements “incorrect and misleading” in an emailed
  statement, adding that it had not received “formal notification of a class
  action”. It said that the ECJ ruling did not find that Booking.com’s “best
  price” clauses were anti-competitive but “simply stated that such clauses fall
  within the scope of EU competition law and that their effects must be assessed
  on a case-by-case basis”. The company referred to a statement about its
  “commitment to fair competition”, in which it argued that “past parity clauses
  served to foster competitive pricing rather than restrict it”. It cited a poll
  in which 74% of hoteliers said Booking.com made their business more
  profitable, with many reporting higher occupancy rates and lower customer
  acquisition costs. However, other industry representatives criticised the
  company’s practices as extractive. “As they gained control of the market,
  Booking was able to increase its commission rates and exert much greater
  pressure on hoteliers’ margins,” Véronique Siegel, president of the hotels
  division of French hospitality sector association Umih, told public
  broadcaster France Inter. “For a room that the customer pays €100 (£87) for,
  if you take away Booking’s commission, the hotelier receives €75 at best, with
  which they have to pay their employees and invest.” Despite the friction,
  Booking.com appears unavoidable for many hotels, offering an online reach and
  visibility hard to achieve for smaller, independent establishments. A study by
  Hotrec and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland
  found that Booking Holding, the website’s parent company, controlled 71% of
  the European market in 2024, compared with 68.4% in 2019. The corporation is
  valued at $170bn (£127bn), three times that of Volkswagen. Rupprecht Podszun,
  director of the institute for competition law at Düsseldorf’s Heinrich Heine
  University, said Booking.com was a classic example of how a digital platform
  could conquer an entire sector, creating a “winner takes all” dynamic. He said
  the legal action would probably be protracted and turn on the thorny question
  of how damages could be measured. “Judges will have to form an opinion and
  then it will go through all the appeals – everything at great expense and with
  all the tricks available under the law,” he told Germany’s daily Süddeutsche
  Zeitung. “The case is a revolt of the hotels, saying: ‘You can’t just do what
  you want with us.’”
