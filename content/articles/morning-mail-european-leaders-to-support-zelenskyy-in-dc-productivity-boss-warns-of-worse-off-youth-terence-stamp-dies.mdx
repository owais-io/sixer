  Good morning. Last time Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House, it didn’t
  end well: Donald Trump and JD Vance berated him and accused him of
  ingratitude. This time he will come with a support crew: European leaders
  including the UK’s Keir Starmer and France’s Emmanuel Macron will join him to
  push back against a deal with Russia that would permanently cede large parts
  of Ukraine. Back in Australia, the Productivity Commission chief has warned
  young people need major government intervention to improve their lives. Plus:
  we farewell Terence Stamp, the British actor who starred in one of the great
  Australian movies. Australia Growth mindset | Young Australians may endure
  worse lives than their parents, Danielle Wood, the chair of the Productivity
  Commission, has warned. Exclusive | Sydney’s Northern Beaches hospital has
  settled outside court with a family after claims their baby was born by
  emergency caesarean at 25 weeks and left with lifelong disabilities. Fishy
  business | The Tasmanian Liberal party has promised a pause on salmon farm
  expansion and an independent review of the industry as it attempts to win
  support from crossbench MPs and survive a no-confidence motion in the state
  parliament this week. Going green | One of Australia’s largest renewable
  energy transmission projects has expanded zones for solar, battery and wind
  developments, with the cost of connection projected to almost double. Sydney
  shooting | One man is dead and another was taken to hospital after a shooting
  outside a Sydney hotel on Sunday evening. World Ukraine | European leaders
  including Keir Starmer will join Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a White House meeting
  with Donald Trump on Monday in an extraordinary joint effort to push back on a
  US-backed plan that would allow Russia to take further Ukrainian territory.
  Our correspondent writes that he faces a daunting task. Middle East | The
  Israeli general who headed military intelligence on 7 October 2023 has said 50
  Palestinians must die for every person killed that day and “it does not matter
  now if they are children”, in recordings broadcast by Israel’s Channel 12 TV
  station. Climate crisis | While Canada is experiencing its second-worst burn
  on record, the blazes come with a twist: few are coming from the western
  provinces, the traditional centre of destruction. Cinema mourns | Terence
  Stamp, one of the stellar faces of British 60s cinema, who had a second act
  from the late 1970s as a character actor in the likes of Superman: The Movie,
  The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and The Limey, has died aged
  87. Survival story | A California man who recently became trapped behind a
  waterfall for two days while climbing was dramatically rescued by police
  utilising a helicopter. Full Story How doomsday prepping went mainstream in
  Australia It used to be a view held by a secretive few on the fringes of
  society, but preparing for disaster has now grown in popularity, with many
  believing having a backup plan just makes good sense. Senior reporter Kate
  Lyons spoke to Reged Ahmad on whether there is value in preparing for an
  apocalypse that may never come. In-depth The independent MP Kate Chaney makes
  the case for why Labor must take advantage of its comfortable majority to fix
  Australia’s tax system. The one we currently have overburdens younger
  Australians, she argues. Chaney writes: “Any party that wants to be taken
  seriously as a contender for government in 2028 must come to the election with
  a tax plan that is fair, future-focused, and fit for the demographic changes
  ahead.” Not the news Dellaram Vreeland has a habit of striking up
  conversations with strangers, even swapping numbers with people she’s just
  met. While some of her friends may recoil at the thought of doing so, she says
  the fear of “stranger danger” is getting in the way of building community and
  genuine human connection. Sport Athletics | The rising middle-distance star
  Claudia Hollingsworth has smashed the Australian 800m record in a clear
  statement of intent a month out from the world athletics championships in
  Tokyo. AFL | The Crows-Pies fixture had the lot. Was it a preview for the
  grand final? Jonathan Horn looks at the weekend’s most exciting match. Premier
  League | Arsenal beat Manchester United 1-0, after Riccardo Calafiori was able
  to score off a goalkeeper’s error. Media roundup Trump’s tariffs concern
  Australians more than China’s military, according to a Newspoll reported in

  Sydney-based non-alcoholic beer company Heaps Normal, per the Financial
  Review. What’s happening today Canberra | Productivity Commission chair
  Danielle Wood will address the National Press Club. Sydney | The federal court
