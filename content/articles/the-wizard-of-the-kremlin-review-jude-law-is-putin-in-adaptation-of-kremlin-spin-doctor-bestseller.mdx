  Giuliano da Empoli’s smash-hit satirical novel The Wizard of the Kremlin,
  about a Putin spin doctor called Vadim Baranov and based on shadowy Russian
  politician Vladislav Surkov, has now been converted into an exasperatingly
  laborious and literal-minded movie, burdened with endless dull voiceover. It
  has been written for the screen by its estimable director Olivier Assayas,
  working with the formidable author and reportage journalist Emmanuel Carrère;
  Carrère in fact has a cameo here, playing a supercilious French figure at a
  raucous Moscow student party in the early 90s, patronisingly informing the
  young people present that it was the communism they’ve just rejected that
  really believed in the arts. The action takes us through the 1990s decline of
  ailing president Boris Yeltsin and the promotion of FSB chief Vladimir Putin
  as prime minister by entrenched oligarchic interests who assume he will be
  their apparatchik puppet. Through the eyes of our strangely cynical
  media-manipulator hero, we see Putin’s presidential election triumph in 2000,
  the sinking of the Kursk submarine, which tested the president’s neo-Stalinist
  ruthlessness in ignoring public-opinion pressure orchestrated by unreliable
  courtier and media magnate Boris Berezovsky (who was destined for a lonely
  death in UK exile), the Chechen wars, the annexation of Crimea, the
  development of internet black ops and bot farms, and Putin’s growing hatred of
  Ukraine. Will Keen plays the bullish and hubristic Berezovsky, Tom Sturridge
  is private banker Dimitri Sidorov (based on Mikhail Khodorkovsky), and Alicia
  Vikander does her best with the uninteresting role of “Ksenia”, a
  fictionalised girlfriend who leaves Baranov for Sidorov. Jude Law, with a
  bland suit and sinister, thinning combover plays Putin, described as the
  “tsar” throughout, convincingly fabricating Putin mannerisms like the thin
  smile, the wince of disgust at weakness or disloyalty, and the brief,
  fastidious handshake with cowed visitors followed by the curt gesture to the
  chair where they should sit. (This is in the era before petitioners and
  diplomats were made to sit at the end of a table the size of an aircraft
  carrier.) And the (supposedly) fascinating and enigmatic Baranov (the
  Surkov-style “wizard” or Rasputin-esque power behind the throne) is played by
  Paul Dano; a former liberal idealist, theatre producer and enthusiast for the
  anti-Stalin satirical novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which inspired Orwell –
  but which Surkov, as he climbs the Putin ladder of power, effectively comes to
  regard as a blueprint for sophisticated repression. Sadly, Dano’s performance
  consists of a one-note, smirking, singsong dialogue delivery, almost as if he
  is speaking under hypnosis, which is soporific both in the way he does it on
  camera and in the interminable voiceover that drones its way through almost
  the entire film. (He is supposedly telling his story in flashback to a
  visiting American academic played by Jeffrey Wright.) Dano’s undirected,
  undifferentiated portrayal doesn’t have a fraction of the style and subtlety
  of, say, his performance as Count Bezhukov in the BBC’s War and Peace. And in
  fact the whole movie is completely without the style and real insight of the
  comparable fictions we’ve seen lately, such as Peter Morgan’s stage play
  Patriots, whose London production had Tom Hollander as Berezovsky and Will
  Keen as Putin, or Kirill Serebrinnikov’s film Limonov: The Ballad with Ben
  Whishaw as former punk author turned Russian ultra-nationalist Eduard Limonov
  – who shows up briefly and far less excitingly in this film. Oddly, the
  Serebrennikov film was based on Emmanuel Carrère’s biographical novel. Law
  keeps the movie ticking over with his chilly impersonation of power – part
  pope, part mobster – but the movie is not especially interested in digging
  very deeply into his personality. I would love to see instead a Putin movie
  that shows the true story of how Putin, very excited at the Russian director
  Andrei Zvyagintsev’s Venice Golden Lion victory for The Return in 2003,
  invited him to tea at the Kremlin and exuberantly brandished his (pirated) DVD
  copy of the movie. But The Wizard of the Kremlin just feels pointless in its
  knowing cynicism, right up to the silly, unearned flourish of violence at the
  very end. Dano’s character doesn’t seem plausible, either as a young liberal
  or as a fully fledged political power broker, or as the retired bittersweet
  narrator of the present day. His performance is bloodless … and without magic.
  • The Wizard of the Kremlin screened at the Venice film festival.
