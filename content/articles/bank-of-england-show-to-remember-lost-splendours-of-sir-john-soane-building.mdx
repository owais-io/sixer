  A century ago the wrecking ball demolished the halls, courtyards, arches and
  domes of one of London’s best-loved buildings in what the architectural
  historian Nikolaus Pevsner would decry as “the greatest architectural crime”
  to befall the capital in the 20th century. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street
  (as the Bank of England was nicknamed after a satirical 1797 cartoon of
  William Pitt the Younger, prime minister from 1783 to 1801, wooing an old lady
  dressed in pound notes) has been the heart of the City since 1734. Refashioned
  and expanded over the decades, after the 1780 Gordon riots, when rioters
  scaled the neighbouring church of St Christopher le Stocks to throw
  projectiles at the Bank, the church was demolished to allow the Bank’s
  expansion westwards along Threadneedle Street. In 1788 the Bank appointed Sir
  John Soane as architect and surveyor. His redesign, which he continued until
  1833, resulted in arguably his greatest work, “the pride and boast” of his
  life. And so it remained, a beloved neo-classical masterpiece, until the
  1920s. Today, little exists of Soane’s much-loved building; the only part
  still in situ is the immense curtain wall that curves around the building. But
  a new exhibition, Building the Bank – 100 Years On, at the Bank of England
  Museum, offers a window into the lost architectural splendours as the
  post-world war one Bank outgrew its buildings, and its rebirth as the equally
  impressive replacement by Sir Herbert Baker began to spring up in its place
  100 years ago. Unpublished black-and-white images by the architectural
  photographer Francis Yerbury (1885-1970) show workers amid the rubble and
  exposed bricks, a decorative caryatid statue dangling beneath a great glass
  dome and the Bank’s new steel frame emerging above the city streets. Baker,
  with experience in South Africa and India, was chosen to create a building
  radiating “strength, permanence and reliability”, a centre of the British
  empire in London in the 1920s. The building was finished in Portland stone,
  reaching seven floors above ground and three below, and was completed on the
  eve of the second world war. Baker strove to recreate much of the classical
  symbolism and flourishes of Soane and his predecessor the architect Robert
  Taylor. Jennifer Adam, the curator of the Bank of England Museum, said:
  “Despite the controversy surrounding the pulling down of Sir John Soane’s
  building, Baker’s Bank remains an effective and architecturally significant
  landmark in London. Baker hugely admired Soane’s work and much of the
  classical symbolism nods to the work of Baker’s predecessors.” Baker’s Bank,
  as it remains today, features the work of many artists and craftspeople.
  Stunning 1930s mosaics by the Russian artist Boris Anrep decorate the ground
  floor and are reproduced for the exhibition. A series of mural paintings
  records the Bank around the time of its demolition. Sculptures by Charles
  Wheeler, later president of the Royal Academy, are everywhere and were the
  biggest sculpture commission of the period. Visitors to the free exhibition at
  the museum, housed in the same building as the Bank, can enjoy the entrance
  lobby, which is a replica of Taylor’s 18th-century Bartholomew Lane entrance.
  The museum also features a reproduction of Soane’s Stock Office from 1792. The
  lobby of the museum rotunda, which will house part of the exhibition, is a
  direct copy of a space designed by Soane. The exhibition, which runs from 16
  September until spring 2027, will also display Roman archaeological
  discoveries made on the site a century ago, including oil lamps, combs and
  vases. Surviving elements of Soane’s building include the original conical
  bricks he developed for the Bank’s rotunda, a model of the Temple of Vesta at
  Tivoli in Italy, which inspired his design of the Bank’s Tivoli Corner.
  Baker’s hand-drawn designs and sketches, including 1930s suggestions for new
  British coins, along with proposals for sculpture and mosaics, will also be on
  display. “The sculptures and mosaic are magnificent public artworks, designed
  to communicate the Bank’s role and purpose. We’re excited to share them
  through this exhibition and celebrate the architecture and design heritage
  here at the Bank of England,” said Adam. • Building the Bank – 100 Years On is
  at the Bank of England Museum, London, from 16 September
