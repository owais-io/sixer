  Sport England will meet the Rugby Football League in the coming weeks to air
  their concerns over developments at the governing body. It is a move that
  could affect the sport’s financial outlook. Rugby league is one of several
  sports in receipt of millions of pounds worth of funding from Sport England
  every year. That is critical to the existence of the sport and is particularly
  important for the RFL, with continued adherence to the code for sports
  governance essential to maintain it. The RFL has been under scrutiny in recent
  months with its former chief executive Nigel Wood returning to the
  organisation, initially as its interim chair after the resignation of Simon
  Johnson in March. Wood was appointed by clubs to lead a strategic review of
  the professional game, which recommended Super League expanding to 14 teams as
  early as 2026. That was approved by clubs at a meeting in Leeds on Monday, two
  weeks on from Wood’s interim position as chair being made permanent. The code
  details all key leadership appointments – such as chair of the governing body
  – have to follow recruitment processes that are deemed “open and transparent”
  by Sport England. Meetings are planned in light of Wood’s installation as
  permanent chair. Sport England spokesperson said: “All organisations in
  receipt of significant funding from Sport England must reach the standards of
  the Code for Sports Governance. This includes major leadership appointments
  following open and transparent recruitment processes. Following recent
  developments, we will meet with the leadership of the RFL in the coming weeks
  to address our concerns.” Tony Sutton, the RFL’s CEO, said: “The RFL is
  working with Sport England on a Governance Action Plan, following the
  resignations from the Board earlier in the year. The new board at the RFL
  remain totally committed to working towards full compliance with Sport
  England’s Code for Sports Governance.” Wood’s return was seen by many as
  controversial. He left his role as chief executive in 2018 and was paid a
  severance package of more than £300,000. He has since held the role of chair
  at Bradford Bulls, a role he relinquished in order to return to the RFL,
  though he remains a shareholder of the Championship club. However, those same
  clubs now feel he is the best individual for the overhaul of the professional
  game, led by an expansion of Super League to 14 teams. The Guardian revealed
  on Wednesday how Sky Sports were seeking answers from Super League on the
  decision to extend the competition. The RFL have been approached for comment.
