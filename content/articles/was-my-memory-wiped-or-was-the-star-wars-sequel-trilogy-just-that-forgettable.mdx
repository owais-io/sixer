  Was my memory wiped or was the Star Wars sequel trilogy just that
  forgettable?

  There might just be a strange irony to this week’s news that Oscar Isaac, AKA
  the tousled X-wing pilot Poe Dameron, is up for a return to Star Wars if the
  script is right. Because before the actor’s comments in a new interview with
  Variety, it was quite possible to forget that the sequel trilogy ever existed.
  Was The Force Awakens really a film, or just two hours of Disney rummaging
  through George Lucas’s recycling bin? Did The Last Jedi split the fanbase so
  violently that Brexit looked like a parking dispute? And could The Rise of
  Skywalker really have stunk that badly? The problem with the post-Lucas films
  is that they never quite decided what they wanted to be. The Force Awakens
  tried nostalgia cosplay. The Last Jedi tried to set fire to nostalgia cosplay.
  The Rise of Skywalker then tried to urgently stitch nostalgia back together
  again. The result was messy, divisive, and – crucially for Disney – almost
  impossible to spin off. Isaac might be up for returning as Dameron, but the
  truth is that nobody can remember why that might have ever seemed like a good
  idea. He had a nice leather jacket, right? When all’s said and done, and six
  years after JJ Abrams’s final instalment vanished down the memory hole with
  all the grace of Jar Jar Binks attempting parkour, this most dysfunctional and
  directionless of trilogies really does seem to have fewer memorable characters
  primed for Disney+ spin-offs or standalone movies than the Mos Eisley cantina
  band’s roadie crew. Lucas, for all his faults, gave us the original trilogy –
  and iconic titans of space opera such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Leia
  Organa and Han Solo (not to mention Yoda, Chewie and even Boba Fett). Then he
  did it all over again, with much less success but still a few shiny new Jedi
  trading cards along the way: a lot of Star Wars fans really hated the
  prequels, but those three films and the spin-off Clone Wars series still gave
  us Ahsoka Tano, Darth Maul and Ewan McGregor’s young Obi-Wan Kenobi. What
  exactly have the sequels left us? So far it appears to be a jittery ball
  droid, a half-melted clone of Palpatine and a guy who shouted “TR-8R!” once
  before Han Solo zapped him. Unfortunately, Lucasfilm doesn’t seem to have
  quite grasped the problem. In the years since The Rise of Skywalker vanished
  from the cultural lore, the Disney-owned studio has wisely pivoted to a
  completely different galactic era, decades before Luke. It has found a sweet
  spot on TV with the likes of Andor and The Mandalorian, so much so that the
  latter is getting a big screen transfer with the forthcoming The Mandalorian
  and Grogu. But officially, at least, we are also still getting director
  Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy’s “new Jedi order” film, in which Daisy Ridley’s Rey
  will attempt to rebuild the cuddly space monk cult from the ashes of nine
  increasingly bewildering films. The internet has tried really hard to announce
  that the project is cancelled but so far appears to be failing. Still, there
  is something a little suspicious about the fact we don’t have a release date
  yet (it was removed from Disney’s official slate late last year) or even a
  movie title. And given the pitiful survival rate of previous Kathleen Kennedy
  projects – that elusive Taika Waititi film; Josh Trank’s mysteriously vanished
  spin-off about Boba Fett; an entire Rian Johnson trilogy, for Yoda’s sake – it
  would hardly be a shock if the whole thing eventually slipped quietly into the
  Sarlacc’s gaping maw. In the meantime, the longer this one sits in development
  limbo, the more the likes of Dameron, General Hux and the force ghost of Kylo
  Ren risk drifting into that very special type of Star Wars purgatory usually
  reserved for expanded universe novels about tax disputes in the Coruscant
  Senate. In a galaxy where even Boba Fett’s jetpack once got a spin-off, the
  $4bn trilogy meant to save Star Wars may end up remembered as little more than
  a dusty Wookieepedia footnote – the cinematic equivalent of Greedo shooting
  first, and nobody really caring either way.
