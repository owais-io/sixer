  Measures for a Funeral review – virtuosic classical music drama is like a Tár
  companion piece
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  This high-minded, dense and in many ways impressive drama about classical
  music from Canadian director Sofia Bohdanowicz could serve as an introspective
  companion piece to Tár. Where Todd Fields’ film was concerned with artists out
  in the world and modern cancel culture, here the focus is unswervingly on art
  itself: its inner sustaining emotional function for the artist and, more
  widely, for all of us. Deragh Campbell stars as academic researcher Audrey
  Benac, a character she has played before for Bohdanowicz, including in
  Veslemøy’s Song, the 2018 short from which Measures for a Funeral has been
  expanded. This time Audrey is on the trail of Kathleen Parlow, a virtuosic
  real-life 20th-century violinist who, in this film, tutored her grandfather.
  Music weighs heavily on the Benac family; as Audrey rifles through university
  archives, she receives guilt-ridden calls from her dying mother, a failed
  musician who holds her responsible for her stalled career. Carrying her
  grandfather’s instrument like some form of penance, this timorous student
  seems to be seeking redemption through her interest in Parlow, a maverick who
  refused marriage in order to dedicate herself to her art. From a textured
  Peter Greenaway-esque opening that intercuts a classical score being scanned,
  an orchestra tuning up, the Montreal skyline and Audrey on the phone to her
  mum, Bohdanowicz often displays something close to virtuosic technique
  herself. As Audrey shadows Parlow in London and Oslo, an ever-present
  undertone of unease threatens to bloom into full-blown horror. When she meets
  Elise (real-life prodigy Maria Dueñas), a hurricane of a violinist who melds
  with Parlow in her fantasies, it feels like we’re stepping into an Alfred
  Hitchcock dream. However, the elliptical style and stilted dialogue, with
  Audrey’s conversations often sounding like academic commentary, make the film
  hard to love. Adrift between Parlow’s reminiscences and her researcher’s
  travels and sullen reveries, it feels like a speculative symphony trying to
  recreate its own score. But the uncertainty and inhibition are perhaps the
  point. “It doesn’t have to be a masterpiece. It’s possible it’s intentionally
  fragmentary. A lack of precision can be a conscious strategy,” says Audrey,
  defending a lost opus Parlow once performed and that she now wants to put on
  stage. This feels like Bohdanowicz justifying her own approach – and by
  extension the fumbling accommodation with life that all artists, and maybe all
  human beings, must practise. Fully committed to a radical irresolution, this
  simultaneously alienating and beautiful film bears repeat viewing. • Measures
  for a Funeral is at the ICA, London, from 22 August.
