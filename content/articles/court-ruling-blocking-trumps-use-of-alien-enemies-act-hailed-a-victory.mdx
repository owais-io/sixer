  A court ruling that blocked Donald Trump from invoking the Alien Enemies Act
  to deport Venezuelans he alleged were part of a criminal gang has been hailed
  as “a victory for the rule of law”. In a 2-1 decision on Tuesday, a
  three-judge panel of the 5th US circuit court of appeals issued a preliminary
  injunction that prevents the Trump administration using the 1798 law to
  justify rapid deportations. Circuit judge Leslie Southwick, writing for the
  majority, rejected the administration’s assertion that the Venezuelan gang
  Tren de Aragua had engaged in a “predatory incursion” on US soil. The Alien
  Enemies Act gives the government expansive powers to detain and deport
  citizens of hostile foreign nations, but only in times of war or during an
  “invasion or predatory incursion”. Legal advocates welcomed the ruling by the
  fifth circuit, the first federal appeals court to rule directly on a 14 March
  presidential proclamation invoking the act. Norman Eisen, the founder and
  executive chair of the Democracy Defenders Fund, which has been helping lead
  national court fights against the Trump administration, said: “This was a
  striking result from the extremely conservative Fifth Circuit, affirming what
  is obvious to any American who looks outside their window. There is no
  invasion by Venezuela or its gangs that authorises Trump’s declaration of such
  under the Alien Enemies Act. “Indeed, that was also the view of more than 20
  conservatives from every administration, from Nixon to Trump 1, who we at
  Democracy Defenders Fund represented in filing a brief explaining that this
  bogus declaration was a betrayal of conservative principles.” The court agreed
  with the brief that there was no legal basis for Trump’s action, the latest
  indication that, even as other guardrails erode, the courts continue to act as
  a check on Trump’s expansion of presidential power. The Democracy Defenders
  Fund alone has more than 125 legal matters against the president. “The most
  successful dimension of the resistance has been the hundreds of legal cases
  that have stopped Trump in his tracks,” Eisen observed. “The good news is that
  that is like a spark plug that is driving the other parts of the resistance.”
  In his 14 March proclamation, Trump said he would use the Alien Enemies Act to
  swiftly detain and deport members of Tren de Aragua. The president asserted
  that the gang is a state-sponsored international terrorist organisation that
  has invaded US territory. Almost immediately, federal immigration authorities
  deported 130 people that they alleged were members of Tren de Aragua to a
  notorious prison in El Salvador. The supreme court ruled in April that
  challenges to removal under the law must be brought in the federal judicial
  districts where detainees are being held. Since then challenges to the
  president’s invocation of the Act have been unfolding in courts across the
  country, and several judges have blocked deportations under the law within
  their judicial districts. The case before the 5th circuit was brought by a
  group of alleged Tren de Aragua members being held at the Bluebonnet detention
  facility in Anson, Texas. The ACLU, or American Civil Liberties Union, which
  represents the men, has disputed the claims of gang membership. ACLU lawyer
  Lee Gelernt, who represented the Venezuelans, said: “The Trump
  administration’s use of a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate
  immigration was rightly shut down by the court. This is a critically important
  decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an
  emergency without any oversight by the courts.” The Brennan Center for Justice
  at NYU Law, the Cato Institute thinktank and others filed an amicus brief in
  the case, arguing that the law’s text and history show that the Alien Enemies
  Act was designed for wartime, not peacetime, and that the president exceeded
  the limits of his powers by invoking the law for deportations. Katherine Yon
  Ebright, counsel in the Brennan Center’s liberty and national security
  program, said: “This opinion is a victory for the rule of law and our system
  of checks and balances. “It affirms that baseless national security claims do
  not negate truth, common sense, and individual liberties: there is no
  ‘invasion’ or other act of war that justifies invoking the Alien Enemies Act,
  an outdated and dangerous statute that was last used for internment in World
  War II. The Trump administration should immediately rescind its invocation of
  the law.” The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S.
  history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.
  The Trump administration could ask the entire 5th Circuit to rehear the case.
  It is expected to eventually reach the supreme court.
