  The supreme court has partly overturned an earlier ruling on the car finance
  commission scandal – seemingly granting UK banks a reprieve and potentially
  limiting compensation payouts to those consumers whose cases are more serious.
  We explain what this means for car buyers, whether anyone should expect
  compensation, and what the next steps are. How did we get here? The car loans
  scandal has been rumbling on for more than 18 months but ballooned after a
  court of appeal judgment that sided with three consumers in October 2024.
  Before that point, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was running a
  narrower investigation into discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs),
  where motor finance lenders gave dealers the power to set interest rates on
  car loans. The higher the interest rate, the more commission the dealer
  received. The controversial practice – which allegedly incentivised dealers to
  overcharge customers – was eventually banned by the FCA in 2021. In the
  meantime, three car buyers took their cases to the court of appeal, which
  ruled on the much wider issue of how commissions were disclosed. In October
  2024, that court sided with the claimants and ruled that it was against the
  law for the dealers to receive any sort of commission from the lender without
  first telling the customer and getting their informed consent. Why was the
  appeal court ruling so important? The shock decision had ramifications for all
  hidden commission arrangements, not just DCAs. Across the UK, 80-90% of new
  cars, and an increasing number of used vehicles, are bought with the help of a
  loan, the vast majority of which would be arranged by a broker who is paid
  commission by a lender. The judgment threw open the door to a huge
  compensation bill for car lenders –including Santander UK, Close Brothers,
  Barclays and Lloyds – that some analysts said could top £44bn. That would be
  comparable to the payment protection insurance (PPI) saga, which cost banks
  £50bn. It also raised concerns that other types of loans involving commission
  payments to brokers could be in play, such as those for appliances and
  furniture. The two specialist lenders involved in the court of appeal case,
  Close Brothers and FirstRand, challenged the ruling in the supreme court,
  which has now revealed its verdict. What did the supreme court decide? It has
  partly overturned the decision, apparently closing the door to compensation
  except in more serious cases. In their ruling, a panel of justices led by the
  supreme court president, Lord Reed, upheld only one consumer’s case,
  originally filed by Marcus Johnson. Cases brought by two other consumers –
  alleging that commissions paid to car dealers were bribes and that dealers
  owed a duty of loyalty to the customer – were rejected. The decision will be a
  blow to many consumers and the claims industry, but the fact that part of the
  earlier ruling was upheld has complicated the picture and meant that
  immediately after the verdict, experts had differing views about the potential
  impact. Friday’s judgment followed a three-day hearing at the start of April.
  What happens next? We won’t have long to wait to find out. The FCA said on
  Friday that it wanted to provide clarity as quickly as possible, so it would
  confirm whether it would consult on bringing in a compensation scheme before
  the stock market opens on Monday morning. “Our aims remain to ensure that
  consumers are fairly compensated and that the motor finance market works
  well,” it said. “If we do decide to propose a redress scheme, we’ll consult
  widely.” Many believe the FCA will announce a central compensation scheme for
  consumers whose agreements included a DCA. That could add up to many
  thousands, potentially millions, of vehicle buyers. The court’s decision to
  uphold Johnson’s claim has complicated things, however, and could also
  increase the chances of redress for cases such as his, in which the
  relationship between the finance company and the customer is deemed to be
  unfair. What constitutes “unfair” is likely to be the subject of a lot of
  discussion. Richard Coates, a partner and the head of automotive at the law
  firm Freeths, said: “It is anticipated that the FCA will bring redress for
  those cases where it is deemed that the relationship is unfair, and we expect
  to learn more from the FCA about this redress scheme within the next six
  weeks.” Interested parties, however, could challenge any scheme in court. They
  will have six weeks to refer it to the upper tribunal, which could put the
  brakes on any redress programme. But barring any legal challenge or further
  delay, the FCA scheme would probably start operating next year, meaning former
  car-loan customers could start receiving compensation in 2026. Who could be
  eligible for compensation? Those most likely to be eligible are those whose
  agreement included a DCA, though the FCA could restrict or widen eligibility
  depending on its own continuing work and its views of the latest judgment.
  DCAs were by far the most common commission arrangement before they were
  outlawed: on average, between 2007 and 2020, about three-quarters of all
  agreements had a DCA of some sort, says the regulator. The “end date” for
  potential eligibility for any redress has been suggested as 28 January 2021,
  when DCAs were banned. How much compensation could harmed borrowers end up
  getting? This is still unclear and will hinge on the scope of the FCA’s
  redress scheme – assuming it definitely happens – with more details likely in
  the coming weeks and months. The FCA has indicated it would need to balance
  the interests of consumers, firms and the broader economy when setting up a
  compensation scheme. The regulator has said that as well as being “fair to
  consumers who’ve lost out”, any scheme must “ensure the integrity of the motor
  finance market, so that it works well for future consumers”. In the case of
  DCAs, the regulator has estimated that consumers may have been overcharged by
  £1,100, as a result of paying too much interest on a typical £10,000,
  four-year car finance deal where this arrangement was used. But whether
  individuals would get back all or just a part of their “loss” remains to be
  seen. It could also require firms to pay interest on top of any compensation,
  which could add up to a lot if it is several years’ worth. Meanwhile, claims
  law firms have said some clients were charged much more, amounting to several
  thousand pounds more in hidden commission. Should aggrieved consumers use a
  claims firm? Social media and websites have been littered with adverts
  claiming consumers could be entitled to thousands in compensation, and urging
  them to act fast. But the FCA and Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) are
  concerned that some firms are not telling consumers about free alternatives,
  are making bold and sometimes misleading claims about payouts, and are
  charging fees worth up to 30% of any compensation payout. Over the past year,
  the FCA has forced 224 motor finance commission adverts to be changed or
  pulled entirely, while the SRA is now investigating 73 law firms for potential
  breaches. Some claims management companies are merely fishing for customer
  “leads”, which are then passed on to third-party law firms for a fee. How has
  the government reacted? The Treasury said: “We respect this judgment from the
  supreme court and we will now work with regulators and industry to understand
  the impact for both firms and consumers.” The government has been the target
  of heavy lobbying by the car loan industry, which had warned that a big
  compensation bill could force lenders to claw back their losses – resulting in
  some car finance providers offering fewer or more expensive loans, while
  others could go bust. The Treasury has also been concerned that the scandal is
  deterring investment in the financial services industry, and therefore putting
  the UK’s economic growth at risk. The Guardian revealed last week that the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had been considering overruling the supreme court’s
  decision with retrospective legislation, in order to help save lenders
  billions of pounds, in the event that it upheld the entirety of October’s
  court of appeal ruling. Given Friday’s verdict, that will not happen.
