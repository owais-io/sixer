  If the latest adaptation of HG Wells’s 1898 novel The War of the Worlds, a
  movie starring Ice Cube and Eva Longoria, was designed to make us pause and
  ask questions, it has certainly succeeded. Unfortunately, what a lot of
  viewers have been asking is why it was inflicted on the public in the first
  place. Is War of the Worlds “one of the worst movies ever made?”, asked the
  BBC. “Shockingly bad War of the Worlds is one of the worst movies of the
  decade,” said the New York Post. “Amazon’s War of the Worlds update should
  never have been released,” declared the Telegraph. The 2005 adaptation,
  starring Tom Cruise, was a smash hit. Now people are flocking to the remake to
  see just how bad a film can be – it’s in the top 10 films watched in the UK
  and US on Amazon Prime. It seems that we have come to love “bad” films almost
  as much as those deemed good. The website Rotten Tomatoes practically
  celebrates films that garner a 0% approval rating: Roberto Benigni’s
  Pinocchio, reborn in 2002 as an Italian fantasy comedy-drama, is one such
  offender; Look Who’s Talking Now in 1993, starring John Travolta and Kirstie
  Alley, replaced talking babies with talking dogs and was slated; while
  Travolta hit rock bottom in 2018 with Gotti, a movie about the New York
  mobster that was so gloriously awful it was nominated for six Razzies, the
  parody prize bestowed on Hollywood’s biggest cinematic failures, including
  worst actor and worst picture. But Hollywood has no exclusive hold on the
  movie clunker machine. Bollywood has vast audiences both within India and
  outside. In 2023, it generated revenues of $1.3bn, securing its own chunk of
  the global movie market – and its own flops. In both cases, the biggest
  pitfalls seem to come with attempting to remake much-loved classics. Bollywood
  tried its own movie version of the US favourite TV sitcom The Archie Show, and
  really shouldn’t have. The Archies, as the Indian version was called, featured
  wooden acting and misguided casting, not helped by controversy over the
  recruitment of nepo babies of already huge Bollywood actors such as Suhana
  Khan (daughter of Shah Rukh Khan) and Agastya Nanda. Some thought it engaging;
  most preferred not to think about it. Jab Harry Met Sejal was a remake of the
  popular When Harry met Sally. Its director, Imtiaz Ali, is usually lauded for
  his captivating storytelling – but not this time. “A weak, meandering, near
  dishonest and awfully misrepresentative film,” was one critic’s verdict. In
  his review, he wrote a lot about the interval and his journey to the toilet.
  But whether it is made in Hollywood or Bollywood, a bad film, no matter how
  boring, unrealistic or slow-paced, can still have value. The Archies led to
  discourse on nepo babies in Bollywood film, and for all its narratorial
  difficulties Jab Harry Met Sejal allowed Arijit Singh to perform his magic
  with hit song Hawayein. Animal, released in 2023, caused an outpouring of
  condemnation as Ranbir Kapoor’s character consistently and crassly played on
  the belief that male dominance and female submission in a relationship is
  normal and necessary. It was bad, really bad – but the national conversation
  that ensued also educated audiences to became more aware and more critical of
  other films that also lauded misogyny. When I returned to the movie Ghilli, a
  Kollywood classic (Kollywood being the informal name for Tamil cinema) that I
  loved as a kid, I couldn’t help but question why the story continues
  romantically, without question, after the heroine is slapped by the supposed
  love of her life. Even notoriously bad movies have the capacity to sharpen our
  sense of critique. The outrage you feel at a film like Animal heightens your
  sensitivities, and perhaps your recognition of wrongdoing in real life. When I
  watched 28 Years Later (the sequel to 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later), all I
  could think was: 28 years later and these zombies are still getting the better
  of the horror industry? I didn’t leave it wondering what would happen 28 eons
  later, but neither do I regret the time spent watching the film, even if it
  didn’t seem realistic. The sight of Teletubbies being watched by children
  spliced with images of humans beings savaged by other, more infected humans
  was more diverting than entertaining, but from my disappointment came
  conversation. Had I not watched it, I would not have had the story to tell; or
  the opportunity to discuss this and rather better horror films with friends.
  Bad films lead to dialogue, which almost inevitably opens a space for better
  ideas and new discourse. And failing that, at least a passionate rant about
  all the other better horror films, allowing people to enjoy a shared rage
  instead of turning against each other. Is there anything to learn from Ice
  Cube’s War of the Worlds? Perhaps it’s that some films made during Covid are
  better left there. Or that “bad” comes in many forms, that “bad” is in the eye
  of the beholder. Or perhaps it’s just that bad art has merit in ways the
  creator may not have intended. Take the Razzie, Ice Cube, and be proud of all
  you have given us moviegoers. Saranka Maheswaran is a London-based student who
