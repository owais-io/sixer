  The Guardian view on inheritance tax rises: to win the argument, ministers
  must build the case on fairness | Editorial

  Britain’s tax debate has changed. Previously the argument was whether there
  would be rises in an autumn budget. Now the only question is which levies the
  Treasury will raise. The shift has been a two-stage process. First, economic
  data made it look highly improbable that Rachel Reeves could fulfil existing
  spending pledges, while also sticking within her self-imposed fiscal rules, on
  current revenue projections. She needs money. Second, the chancellor and the
  prime minister stopped denying that this was the case. They have not confirmed
  that taxes are going up, but they no longer pretend that isn’t a reasonable
  expectation. One option under consideration, as revealed by the Guardian this
  week, is to change the inheritance tax (IHT) regime. The range of reliefs that
  currently limit tax on gifts made in the years prior to death could be
  replaced by a lifetime cap. This would bring more high-value assets into the
  scope of IHT. Only a wealthy minority would be affected. The most recent HMRC
  data shows that fewer than 5% of deaths lead to any required payment of
  inheritance tax. While the headline rate is 40%, various reliefs and
  exemptions bring that down to an effective rate of 13%. A common argument
  against most taxes is the disincentive impact they might have on investment
  and aspiration. That hardly applies to a levy on unearned, hereditary
  windfalls. In utilitarian terms, this is just the sort of pot that an
  enterprise‑oriented exchequer should target. But the public does not see it
  that way. IHT is unpopular despite its negligible impact on most household
  finances. Partly that is a function of wishful thinking. Surveys show voters
  vastly overestimating the likelihood that they will one day inherit or
  bequeath an estate that is taxed. But distaste for IHT also has a deeper
  emotional resonance. It is deemed unfair, as a “double” taxation because
  estates might consist of savings accrued from earnings that were taxed earlier
  in a working life. This is not an exceptional case. Many items and activities
  fall under overlapping tax purviews, but people feel there is something
  particularly mean about the Treasury dipping into the finances of grieving
  families. Failure to address similar reservations led the government into a
  storm of protest last year when very generous IHT reliefs on farmland were
  made slightly less generous. The damage from that furore was out of all
  proportion to the financial gains. The government is right to look at raising
  more money from IHT, but the lessons of past battles must be learned. Myths
  need robust debunking, while other issues around inheritance – the instinct of
  parents to help children – need handling sensitively. There is a powerful
  argument for intergenerational fairness in a society where inheritance,
  especially of property, dictates life chances, dividing ever younger cohorts
  into landowner and tenant classes. Taxing inheritance is a modest but
  necessary levelling mechanism. That case needs making well ahead of the
  budget. The tone of the conversation around tax may have changed, but the
  mechanism involved a prime minister and chancellor reluctantly conceding a
  reality only once it had already been widely acknowledged elsewhere. If they
  want their plans to gain public favour, they must rise out of that reactive,
  defensive crouch and make bigger arguments for a fairer tax system. Do you
