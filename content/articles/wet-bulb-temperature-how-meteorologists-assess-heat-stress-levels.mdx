  The wet-bulb temperature, which is used by meteorologists to assess dangerous
  heat stress levels, is measured by wrapping a moist muslin wick around the
  bottom of a thermometer. As the water evaporates from the cloth it cools the
  thermometer bulb, causing the temperature reading to drop. When this process
  stops the wet-bulb temperature is reached. It is exactly the same process that
  cools the human body during a heatwave. As sweat evaporates from the skin it
  takes away the heat. As anyone who has been to the tropics knows, a dry heat
  means humans can stand a much higher temperature than when the relative
  humidity or wet-bulb temperature is high. In a dry heat, drinking water and
  evaporation from the skin will keep you comfortable, but in higher humidity
  people can literally drip with sweat and suffer heat stress. These last few
  days in southern England have been an example of the wet-bulb temperature
  indicators in action. Temperatures were in the low 30s centigrade during the
  day, and they remained as high as 20C at night with relatively high humidity
  levels, which meant that evaporation of moisture from the skin was slower.
  This led to discomfort for many, but possible danger to older people and very
  young children, who have more difficulty regulating body temperature.
