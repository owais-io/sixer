  Re your article (‘I’ve been spat on’: gender non-conforming women tell of
  toilet abuse after UK’s supreme court ruling, 12 August), while it is possible
  that these women’s experiences are as a result of the recent supreme court
  ruling, this has been happening to me and others I know for a long time. A
  very long time. My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is
  that, since I was about eight, I have been regularly mistaken for a boy or
  man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to
  me or involve someone being openly hostile. For example, in 2022, when flying
  to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe
  that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of
  tears, not least because I had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a
  tumour and had a prominent scar. I have long lived in a world where I expect
  to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft
  8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and
  preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The
  chromosomes remain XX. This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The
  real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of
  what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To
  an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a
  role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even
  further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too – something I
  find just as insulting. The way I am is no statement, no protest, no
  challenge. It is simply how I have always been. Comfy, lazy, functional. Why
  should those be the preserve of men? Felicity Hawksley York • Have an opinion
