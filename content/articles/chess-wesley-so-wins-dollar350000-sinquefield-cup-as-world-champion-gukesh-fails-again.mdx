  The $350,000 Sinquefield Cup is one of the most iconic annual events in the
  chess calendar. Part of the Grand Chess Tour and named after the St Louis
  billionaire Rex Sinquefield, who has been the most generous individual sponsor
  in all chess history, it will be remembered for Fabiano Caruana’s 7/7 start in
  2014 and his record 3098 tournament performance, for Ding Liren’s victory
  ahead of Magnus Carlsen in 2019, and, most of all, for the controversial 2022
  Carlsen-Hans Niemann alleged cheating scandal. For 2025, the organisers
  introduced a four-player Tour Final at São Paulo next month, and the jockeying
  for position for that dominated the action. At the end, Caruana and Wesley So
  (US) and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu (India) tied with 5.5/9, ahead of Levon
  Aronian (US) 5, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France), Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Poland)
  and Sam Sevian (US) 4.5, the world champion Gukesh Dommaraju (India) 4,
  Alireza Firouzja (France) 3.5, Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzbekistan) 2.5. The
  first three plus Vachier-Lagrave got the final qualification spots, but So
  missed out due to sub-par performances earlier in the Tour, while Gukesh again
  disappointed. The speed playoff, which took place after the arbiter rejected a
  request from the players that the title be shared, ended So 1.5, Caruana 1,
  Praggnanandhaa 0.5. So had previously won the Sinquefield Cup in 2016, but the
  former Filipino plays fewer events nowadays, although his success in St Louis
  has raised him to world No 7 in the live ratings. He will miss next week’s
  Fide Grand Swiss in Samarkand, and joked: “Now they have a tough, meatgrinder
  tournament in Uzbekistan while I get to rest!” The key game of the event was
  So’s final round victory against the tailender Abdusattorov, which brought him
  into a tie with Caruana and Praggnanandhaa. After winning it, So gave thanks
  to God, his mother, and … England’s Gawain Maroroa Jones, whose book
  Coffeehouse Repertoire 1 e4 recommends the opening line which So chose against
  Abdusattorov. “It’s actually a very risky line,” he said. “If Black plays
  perfectly, White is even a bit worse, but I thought I had to risk it.” The
  highlight of the game is White’s marathon king march from g1 to b3 before
  launching the decisive push of his king’s side pawns. It is a subtle and
  impressive strategy, characteristic of So at his best. The tournament
  regulations forbade agreed draws, yet every one of the 21 games among the top
  seven was halved. How come? GMs have become adept at tacit agreements to
  hoover everything bar bare kings off the board, as a less provocative
  alternative to early threefold repetitions like the Berlin Wall. It may be
  better for 2026 if the Sinquefield Cup was restored to its place as the climax
  of the Grand Chess Tour and as a tribute to a legendary chess sponsor. Gukesh
  failed again, but will have a chance to revive his career in late October,
  when the St Louis Chess Club celebrates its reopening after a refurbishment
  with a special edition of its annual Champions Showdown, featuring Carlsen,
  Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Gukesh in a double round rapid tournament. This
  $400,000 event will be the highest rated tournament of the year, and will be
  Carlsen’s first appearance in St Louis since the notorious 2022 Sinquefield
  Cup and his game with Hans Niemann, which created one of the biggest scandals
  in chess history. Before that, the 116-player Fide Grand Swiss starting in
  Samarkand, Uzbekistan on 3 September will qualify two more world title
  Candidates, and the 72-player Women’s Grand Swiss will do likewise. GM Nikita
  Vitiugov is England’s only contender after Michael Adams, Maroroa Jones, Luke
  McShane and David Howell all declined invites or were too inactive to meet the
  regulations. On current form, Praggnanandhaa and Vincent Keymer will be the
  favourites in Samarkand, but the Swiss System format makes for an open event.
  Adams’s British Championship win was followed by a meagre 3/9 at the
  Rubinstein Memorial in Polanica-Zdroj, Poland. The draw was unkind to Adams,
  who had three Blacks in his first four games in a strong all-play-all, and
  after a couple of tactical oversights he was often under pressure. He fought
  back at the end, and his brilliant 28…Qg5!! in round eight, with the main idea
  of 29…Qd2! induced his opponent’s immediate resignation. Whose achievement
  was/is best, nine-time British champion Henry Atkins, 10-time winner Jonathan
  Penrose, or nine-time champion Adams? I think Adams has it on several counts.
  Atkins’s titles came when British chess was at a low ebb, when Fred Yates and
  Sir George Thomas were his major rivals, while Joseph Blackburne was in
  decline and Sultan Khan had not yet arrived. Similarly, Penrose won all his
  championships in a 10-year period from 1958 to 1969 when Hugh Alexander and
  Harry Golombek were ageing while the Raymond Keene – William Hartston
  generation had not yet emerged. For his part, Adams has seen off three strong
  GM generations, from Nigel Short and Tony Miles through Matthew Sadler and
  McShane to Howell and Maroroa Jones. In terms of winning percentages, Atkins
  and Adams (both nine title wins in 11 starts) are ahead. In terms of avoiding
  individual defeats, Adams is supreme, with just one loss in 127 games, and
  that was in a rapid playoff to McShane in 2018. In contrast, Penrose lost in
  three successive years (1959, 60, 61) to the same opponent, and it should have
  been four had that player not cravenly offered a draw in 1958 when two pawns
  up. 3987: 1 Ba6+! If 1…Kb8 2 Kb6! h1=Q 3 Nd7+ Ka8 4 Bb7 mate. If 1…Kd8 2 Ne6+
  Ke8 3 Be2! h1=Q 4 Bh5+! Qxh5 5 Ng7+ and 6 Nxh5 wins.
