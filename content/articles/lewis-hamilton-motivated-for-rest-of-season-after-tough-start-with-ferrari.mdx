  Lewis Hamilton is determined to reignite his joy of racing in the second half
  of the Formula One season after bringing the first 14 races of the year to a
  close on a disconsolate and downbeat note. Speaking before this weekend’s
  Dutch Grand Prix, the 40-year-old said he was as fired up as ever to wrestle
  the maximum from the remaining 10 races and, most importantly, enjoy himself
  in the process having endured a torrid start to his new career with Ferrari.
  “I feel determined and motivated to [move forward],” he said. “We’re going to
  work hard, keep our heads down, try to change a few things in our approach and
  start to enjoy ourselves. “There’s been so much pressure in this first half of
  the season that’s not been the most enjoyable. So I think just remembering
  that we love what we do. We’re all in this together and yeah, we’re trying to
  have some fun.” The seven-time champion’s car has been off the pace and the
  process of adapting to Ferrari after 12 years with Mercedes has proved no
  little task, which had appeared to reach something of a nadir at the last
  round in Hungary. However after a summer break during which Hamilton said he
  had unplugged and had a chance to “reset”, he has been able to put the
  intensity and attendant scrutiny of his start at Ferrari behind him. “The
  reason I got into this sport, it was fun for me,” he said. “For anyone in
  whatever career you’re in, if you’re not enjoying what you’re doing, then why
  are you doing it? There can often be so much noise you can lose sight of
  what’s really, really important. I just really want to focus on getting back
  to that enjoyment. “I joined the team that I’ve always dreamed of driving for
  and there’s been so much noise around that it’s kind of clouded us from from
  getting to enjoy it.” Hamilton is currently sixth in the drivers championship
  and has gone 16 meetings without a podium, the longest streak off the top
  steps of his career. He qualified in 12th in Budapest, a result he decried as
  “absolutely useless” and stated that perhaps Ferrari should find another
  driver. After the race he alluded to “a lot going on in the background that is
  not great”. However in Zandvoort he was insistent that he had always faced
  challenges in his career and was confident he and Ferrari would overcome their
  current travails. “I never just got in and just won, there were always
  difficult times,” he said. “I’m the type of person that doesn’t like to get
  complacent and be comfortable and that’s really kind of where I was for the
  long-term relationship I had before.” “Taking this step into a team that I
  truly believe in and I still believe in the potential here and what we can
  achieve together and everyone in the team does so. But no one succeeds without
  going through those tough patches so I do welcome it.”
