  At the end of the 17th century a French travel writer who crossed the Channel
  was clearly impressed by the sweet, comforting treats offered to him,
  declaring with relish: “Ah! What an excellent thing is an English pudding!”
  More than three centuries on, English Heritage has sounded the alarm that the
  good old British pudding is facing extinction. Research from the charity
  suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings
  only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.
  English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great
  British pudding will not exist in 50 years. Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator
  of history at English Heritage, said: “Sweet puddings are closely intertwined
  with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.” For
  the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet
  courses that follow a main meal – so not just traditional “puddings” typically
  made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles. Hann
  waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. “She regularly
  produced a delicious pudding after the main course – things like steamed
  sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling
  down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are
  not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like
  ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.” English Heritage said recipes for sweetened
  meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and
  Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although
  many would also have contained meat. Hann said puddings were once a luxury for
  the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could
  enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.
  “However, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert
  over the past 50 years,” Hann said. “As more women entered the workforce from
  the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started
  to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the
  classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.” The
  research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat
  a daily homemade pudding. While half of people born before 1970 said their
  parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of
  those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then. In an
  attempt to reignite Britain’s love affair with puddings, English Heritage has
  introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky
  toffee and apple crumble and custard. The charity is also launching The
  English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all
  the nation’s favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones,
  accompanied by notes on their history. Four British classics at risk Twelfth
  Night cake By the reign of Elizabeth I, Twelfth Night involved a celebratory
  cake, typically a rich, yeasty fruit bread flavoured with spices, and a token
  or bean hidden inside. The person who found the bean became the Lord of
  Misrule or King of the Bean, and would have to organise the evening’s revelry.
  The cake survived the Reformation. People began to use eggs to raise the cake,
  and as sugar and fruit came down in price, the cake became less of a fruited
  bread and more like a rich fruit cake. Over time, it was replaced by the
  Christmas cake. Soul cake Also know as a soulmass-cake, they were
  traditionally given to children or poorer people, known as “soulers”, who
  would go from door to door singing songs or reciting prayers over
  Allhallowtide (Halloween, Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day). There are written
  references to the custom from as far back as 1511. Records from the 19th
  century show soul cakes as roundels containing flour, butter, sugar, currants,
  spices and eggs. Cabinet pudding Sometimes known as chancellor’s pudding, it
  was very popular in the Georgian era. A traditional bread-and-butter style
  pudding, it is made with dried fruits and moulded and steamed. Served with
  custard. Anglo-Saxon cake A lot of food eaten by Anglo-Saxons is still
  familiar. This cake was made with honey, butter, oats and dried fruit, and
  cooked in a heavy iron saucepan with a lid over a fire. Source: English
