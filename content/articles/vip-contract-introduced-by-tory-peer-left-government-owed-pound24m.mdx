  They were the lucrative deals that epitomised the “VIP lane” set up by Boris
  Johnson’s government during the Covid pandemic, which gave priority for
  personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts to people with political
  connections. Peter Gummer, a former PR boss who has been Tory peer Lord
  Chadlington since 1996, had smooth access at his fingertips. The erstwhile
  adviser to John Major has “close personal friendships with many senior
  Conservative party politicians”, he has said, and as president of the Witney
  constituency association in the Cotswolds is “close friends” with its most
  notable MP: David Cameron. When the pandemic reached Britain early in 2020,
  Chadlington was a director and shareholder of a company registered in Jersey,
  majority-owned and run by David Sumner, a serial entrepreneur then based in
  Dubai. During the first lockdown, Chadlington embarked on an effort to
  introduce a Sumner company to supply PPE. He contacted Cameron first, texting
  him at 7.13am on 19 April 2020. Cameron texted back that his own close friend
  Andrew Feldman, whom he had appointed to the House of Lords when he was prime
  minister, was working for the government on PPE procurement. Chadlington then
  texted Feldman, who said to get in touch on his new Department of Health and
  Social Care email address. By 8.04am, less than an hour after his initial text
  to Cameron, Chadlington was emailing Feldman, copying in Sumner, to make a
  direct introduction. “David,” Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner. “This is
  my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning.
  Drop me off chain. Peter.” Sumner then sent Feldman an offer to supply PPE.
  Feldman forwarded it to civil servants operating the VIP lane, telling them:
  “An interesting offer from David Sumner who was introduced to me by Lord
  Chadlington.” A week later, the DHSC awarded Sumner’s UK company – a small,
  loss-making healthcare staff agency, SG Recruitment – a £24m contract to
  supply coveralls. A month later the government gave the company a second
  contract, worth £26m, to supply hand sanitiser. The full story of how this
  £50m example of the government’s VIP lane commissioning turned out is only
  becoming clearer now. It was far from a success. Despite the government
  contracts, SG Recruitment, later renamed, went into liquidation in December
  2023. The liquidators have just issued their official report. It confirmed for
  the first time that the DHSC entirely rejected as “unusable” the PPE supplied
  under the first contract, and has put in a claim for the full £24m. However,
  all the money has gone from the company. It went bust owing £1.1m in taxes to
  HMRC. The liquidators found that payments were made out of the company to
  connected businesses and “unknown third parties”, some apparently overseas.
  The main bank account was closed in December 2021. Sumner transferred
  ownership of the company in March 2023 to a woman the liquidators said they
  believed to be a Philippine national, whom they were unable to contact. The
  sum total of money found was in an overseas transfers account: £5. The parent
  company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), of which Chadlington was a director then
  chair, went into liquidation earlier, in 2022. Chadlington’s lawyers told the
  Guardian in June 2023 that when he put the Sumner companies forward for PPE
  contracts, he was unaware they had financial difficulties. “He had no
  information which gave rise to financial concerns regarding SGH and/or SGR in
  April 2020,” they said. But the Guardian has seen evidence that indicates
  Chadlington was made aware in January 2020 that some SGH creditors were
  pushing the company, and Sumner personally, to repay at least $18m, claiming
  that they were owed in total approximately $30m at that time. There is also
  publicly revealed evidence that the Sumner companies were under financial
  pressure before Chadlington made his introduction. SGH was put into
  liquidation by a consultant, Douglas Geertz, whose fees were never paid. A
  2022 court judgment noted that SGH’s chief operating officer told him in the
  summer of 2018: “I regret that SGH finds itself in very challenging financial
  circumstances.” In December 2019 other creditors had sued another Sumner group
  company in the British Virgin Islands for £2m. A published court judgment
  noted that: “Relations [with these creditors] deteriorated in late 2018 and
  collapsed completely in September 2019.” The £2m appears never to have been
  paid. SG Recruitment, the UK company, had made losses of £700,000, and was
  financially reliant on SGH, in the year before it was awarded the PPE
  contracts. Despite all this, Chadlington used his connections to contact
  senior Conservative figures from April 2020, including Matt Hancock, then the
  health secretary, promoting Sumner as a supplier of PPE. Chadlington
  encouraged Sumner to secure contracts, messaging him after the approach to
  Feldman with “Brilliant. Keep going” and “Excellent. Looks like you have an
  inside track.” Chadlington has twice been investigated by the House of Lords
  commissioner for standards for his approach to Feldman, under a section of the
  conduct code that says peers “must not seek to profit from membership of the
  House”. Chadlington did not tell either investigation that he sent the email
  introducing Sumner to Feldman. He told the commissioner’s second inquiry in
  August 2023: “I did not facilitate an introduction.” He was cleared of any
  misconduct both times. Chadlington has now disclosed that email introduction
  and the text messages he exchanged with Cameron, Feldman, Hancock and Sumner,
  after he was asked to provide evidence to the Covid-19 public inquiry. It
  published the messages and his witness statement in May this year. Chaired by
  Heather Hallett, the inquiry is considering the VIP lane as part of its
  examination into how the government handled the pandemic. The Covid Bereaved
  Families for Justice (CBFFJ) group, which represents relatives of 7,500 people
  who died of Covid, is an inquiry core participant. The CBFFJ’s lead lawyer,
  Pete Weatherby KC, has been very critical of the VIP lane and highlighted SG
  Recruitment as a key example. The inquiry is looking at how Chadlington’s
  introduction affected the contracts being awarded, but not at whether the PPE
  was ultimately delivered. Johnson’s government’s operation of the VIP lane has
  been widely criticised for prioritising politically connected companies ever
  since its existence was leaked in October 2020. As the government frantically
  scrambled to fill depleted stockpiles, it spent £12bn on PPE in 2020-21, of
  which almost £9bn had to be written off because it was substandard, defective,
  past its use-by date or overpriced. The UK Anti-Corruption Coalition has
  pointed to evidence that VIP lane contracts cost £3.8bn, almost 30% of the
  total, and delivered more expensive and more unusable PPE than non-VIP
  contracts. Hancock and other ministers have defended the VIP lane, arguing
  that it enabled the government to prioritise credible offers. Chadlington was
  a director of SGH from 2018, then was appointed chair in April 2020, starting
  the role in June 2020, his lawyers said. In his statement to the Covid
  inquiry, Chadlington said that it was later, “within a few months” of becoming
  chair, that he and his fellow SGH directors did become “increasingly
  concerned” about the way the business was being run. “We were concerned about
  unpaid wages and fees, contracts falling through, and increasingly vague and
  confusing responses from Mr Sumner and the management team to questions from
  the SGH board, as well as Mr Sumner’s apparent overoptimism about the state of
  the business.” Despite this, as late as April 2021, Chadlington was
  enthusiastically supporting Sumner to bid for a further government PPE
  contract, telling a fellow director that Sumner was being asked to quote “on a
  huge (and I mean huge!) contract” to supply gloves. That showed that the
  government “have no doubts about our legitimacy”, he wrote to the director.
  The same day he messaged Sumner, encouraging him to publicly market the
  company as a government supplier. Ultimately the company was accepted as a
  possible supplier of gloves, but no contracts were awarded. Chadlington has
  repeatedly said he did not personally benefit from the PPE contracts, telling
  the Lords commissioner’s first inquiry in 2022: “I received no commission,
  bonus or direct financial benefit from the two contracts awarded to SG
  Recruitment Limited.” The Guardian has seen SGH filings in Jersey showing that
  in the year after the award of the contracts, Chadlington was issued with
  27.5m new shares in the company, which he appears not to have paid for.
  Chadlington’s lawyers said the shares were not a bonus, they were “growth
  shares” issued to him and the other non-executive directors after he became
  chair and reorganised the board. Three months after supporting Sumner to bid
  for the PPE gloves deal, in July 2021 Chadlington resigned from SGH. All the
  non-executive directors were owed fees, he has said, and they resigned at the
  same time. Chadlington was owed $100,000 director’s fees when SGH went into
  liquidation, almost $350,000 in consultancy fees, and a $180,000 loan. Sumner,
  who is believed to be in the Philippines, replied to the Guardian’s questions
  by email. He said the DHSC reduced the amount of hand sanitiser bought under
  the second contract, paying £16.6m rather than £26m, so £40.6m for the two
  contracts. Sumner said the company had the required commercial and regulatory
  experience to supply PPE and delivered in accordance with the contracts, and
  that profit margins were “circa 15%”, although he did not provide evidence for
  this. He did not answer questions about the payments made out of SG
  Recruitment, or the closing of its bank accounts in 2021, but said that all
  money was “accounted for properly”. In relation to its liquidation, he said
  the company “was sold to a third party” almost a year before, “so it is very
  disappointing that the new owners had not made a success of the company”. He
  said he did not accept Chadlington’s criticisms of his management. Of the SGH
  liquidation and questions about the $30m debts creditors were claiming, Sumner
  said: “SGH Jersey was not a contracting party and so not relevant.” After
  Chadlington provided his messages to the Covid inquiry, the Lords standards
  commissioner has since opened a third inquiry. The possible conduct breaches
  are the same as previously, but also this time whether he failed to act on his
  “personal honour”. That appears to be a question of whether he was not fully
  transparent with the two previous inquiries. Chadlington’s lawyers responded
  to the Guardian’s questions by saying that he did not act in any way
  improperly “in connecting Mr Sumner with Lord Feldman”. They said it was up to
  the government, not Chadlington, to carry out due diligence on SG Recruitment.
  In relation to questions about his knowledge of SGH’s financial position, and
  the $30m debts, when he introduced Sumner for government PPE contracts, the
  lawyers said: “Our client understood that while the company had faced some
  cashflow issues, these were common to most startup businesses.” He only became
  concerned about SGH’s viability later after he became chair, in particular by
  the beginning of 2021, they said. In his witness statement to the Covid
  inquiry, Chadlington said: “While I was not involved in the awarding of
  contracts for PPE, I was proud that, by making the necessary introductions, I
  had played a very small role in helping the country during a national
  emergency.” A DHSC spokesperson said after Labour was elected to government,
  it has sought to recover money from PPE contracts that did not deliver. He did
  not answer questions about SG Recruitment, saying the DHSC cannot currently
  discuss specific companies. A spokesperson for the CBFFJ said: “While our
  loved ones were dying, often without the PPE that could have protected them,
  the system enabled political insiders to use their connections to secure
  public contracts. It is devastating to learn that the PPE from one of SG
  Recruitment’s contracts was rejected as unusable. This is exactly the kind of
  evidence the Covid inquiry should be examining. Bereaved families deserve
  answers. The public deserves answers. Justice means getting to the bottom of
  how this happened, who benefited, and who should be held accountable.”
