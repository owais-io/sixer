  The vitriol faced by scouts and charity rowers mistaken for migrants was not
  an “innocent mistake”, a race equality campaigner has said, as she warned that
  toxic rhetoric could lead to more vigilantism and violence. A wave of
  anti-migrant protests outside asylum hotels in recent weeks has been followed
  by growing reports of vigilantism, with people facing abuse after being
  mistaken for migrants. Police have launched an investigation into an incident
  at a scout camp in Wales, where children were allegedly filmed and subjected
  to racial abuse amid unfounded speculation the site was being used to house
  immigrants. Last week, Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe – formerly of Reform UK,
  now an independent – was accused of being part of a vigilante effort after he
  reported a charity rowing crew he mistakenly thought were possible “illegal
  migrants”. “We’re in a really dangerous situation and the government really
  needs to step up to the challenge,” said Dr Shabna Begum, the chief executive
  of the Runnymede Trust. “We’re in quite a desperate place of despair and
  gloom, and that breeds the division and type of activity that we’re seeing.
  “We are looking at a really bleak future where, if the government doesn’t
  address some of the deep-seated inequalities in the country, we are likely to
  see more of these vigilante groups, which just breed more violence.” Reports
  of a vigilante group in Bournemouth have been met with alarm. More than 200
  residents have supposedly signed up to Safeguard Force, which claims it will
  carry out uniformed patrols in the seaside town to protect “women, children
  and the elderly”. Begum said this type of behaviour had been triggered by a
  “breakdown of the social contract” and a failure of politicians to deal with
  economic deprivation. “We know that vigilantism is not regulated, it’s not
  rational, it is an emotional reaction to a situation where people are feeling
  desperate and are feeling let down and are feeling angry,” she said. “And this
  has implications for all people of colour in this country, because people are
  not checking people’s migrant status or whether they are seeking asylum before
  they make their conclusions about whether they belong, whether they are going
  to be subject to hostility and aggression.” In an effort to placate some
  concerns about crime, the Home Office announced on Wednesday it was rolling
  out 10 new live facial recognition vans to seven police forces across the
  country to locate wanted criminals. It also said every neighbourhood across
  England and Wales will have a named, contactable officer, with dedicated
  antisocial behaviour leads and new visible patrols in town centres. Begum said
  incidents of people being mistaken for migrants were not “innocent mistakes”
  but happened as a result of politicians and the media pursuing an agenda based
  on “flimsy or false information”. “For instance, Rupert Lowe has an agenda, he
  has a particular position on these things … there are thresholds of
  accountability and scrutiny and checking that he should have gone through,”
  she said. “I do think there’s a deliberate disingenuousness around this,
  because it’s convenient and easy to focus on migrants and stopping boats. It’s
  much, much harder to really deal with big structural issues around economic
  inequalities and misogyny.” The largest anti-migrant protests have centred
  around the Bell hotel in Epping in Essex. On Tuesday, the district council
  applied for an interim high court injunction in an effort to stop asylum
  seekers from being housed there. Oliver Coppard, the Labour mayor of South
  Yorkshire, urged politicians and the media to take a responsible approach over
  predicting disorder connected to asylum and migration, saying some people were
  “seemingly trying to will it into existence”. Coppard’s region experienced
  some of the worst trouble last summer, when a far-right mob attacked a hotel
  housing asylum seekers near Rotherham. The area was, he said, “in a very
  different place now”, adding: “The last thing we need is politicians trying to
  talk up the chances of that sort of thing happening again. “Politicians of all
  stripes have a responsibility to be measured in their comments, to try to
  bring people together. And that’s not what we’re seeing from certain parts of
  both the Tory party and Reform.” Coppard singled out the Conservative leader,
  Kemi Badenoch, and the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, saying they
  were using asylum and migration “as a political football rather than speaking
  responsibly on behalf of the whole of the country”. Badenoch said on Tuesday
  that she understood why people in Epping were protesting, and alleged women
  had “stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes”.
  “The people who I spoke to are having a lot of concerns about safety” she
  said. “Mothers told me that they’re worried about their daughters going to
  school. They’re getting harassed. They stopped jogging in the park because
  there are men lurking in bushes. “Communities shouldn’t have to be paying for
  this. And what I saw in Epping really, really upset me. I can see why many of
  those people are protesting.”
