  A man holding what appears to be a pomeranian dog has climbed to the top of
  King’s Cross station in London where has unfurled a banner calling for freedom
  for Iran. The man could be seen standing in front of the clock face on the
  station’s 34-metre tower at rush hour on Tuesday morning. British Transport
  Police said officers were called to King’s Cross at about 8am after reports of
  a person in a precarious position. A spokesperson said: “The incident is
  ongoing and officers are in attendance alongside other emergency services,
  working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.” An ambulance crew, an
  incident response officer and paramedics from the hazardous area response team
  are also present at the scene. The front of the station was shut to passengers
  as Network Rail, which operates the station, isolated the area beneath where
  the protester stood. Network Rail wrote in a post on X that train services had
  been unaffected by the incident. It said it was “supporting emergency services
  to ensure the situation is resolved safely”. Main entrances have remained open
  but the exits from platforms 1-8 have been closed. Suspended from the clock
  tower was a banner with slogans written in Farsi and in English. It states in
  English: “Iran belongs to its people. Freedom for Iran. Every deal with them
  against human rights. Dictators exert terror and poverty.” The banner also
  features the logo of the Freedom Movement of Iran, a pro-democracy party that
  promotes separation between religion and state. The party is outlawed by the
  current Iranian government. The man was holding what appeared to be a
  pomeranian dog and wearing a T-shirt with a “no to war” slogan. He was seen
  making video calls and taking selfies. Police officers wearing climbing
  equipment were preparing to scale the tower. A London fire brigade
  spokesperson said it was called at 8.14am and two fire engines and about 10
  firefighters were assisting British Transport Police.
