  Fringe favourite Ontroerend Goed have a longstanding fascination with the
  audience. In one-to-one encounters such as The Smile Off Your Face and
  Internal, they have put the spectator at the heart of their own drama, often
  to discombobulating effect. In the hall of mirrors of A Game of You, Alexander
  Devriendt’s company made you the unwitting star of someone else’s play, and in
  Audience, it tested the limits of what you deemed acceptable on stage. Earnest
  commentators have fretted over the ethics of all this (me, I love the
  head-spinning thrill of it all), but even though Thanks for Being Here might
  raise similar questions about privacy and consent, it is done in such a spirit
  of communal joy, you would have to be unusually sensitive to object. Funny,
  accepting and warm-hearted, this celebration of the shared experience is the
  perfect festival show. The joke, which becomes apparent only as the
  performance progresses, is that everything we are watching has been generated
  by the audience: either those of us here today or those who have seen it
  previously. As with Internal, which was a mix of speed-dating and group
  therapy, no performance is ever the same, being determined by the
  participants, even as the underlying structure is solid. My audience played
  their parts consummately, instinctively understanding the rules of entering
  the auditorium, finding a seat, getting comfortable, puzzling over the
  performance, wondering if it could be improved and, no doubt, discussing it in
  the bar afterwards. It would be normal to credit the performers, Karolien De
  Bleser, Charlotte De Bruyne, Patricia Kargbo and Leonore Spee – and they do
  indeed bring a deliciously deadpan observational wit – but the real accolades
  go to all of us for being the show we demanded and for doing it so
  unselfconsciously. Darlings, we were marvellous. • At Zoo Southside,
