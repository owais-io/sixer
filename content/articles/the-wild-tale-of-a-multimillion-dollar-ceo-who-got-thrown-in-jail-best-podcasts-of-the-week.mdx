  Webster follows another twisty scandal. Candace Rivera built a flawless online
  brand as a divorced single mother, nurse and CEO of multimillion-dollar

  BBC Studios and American giants iHeart tells the true story of a grim murder
  in Texas and a woman, Sandy Melgar, wrongfully convicted for the death of her
  husband, Jim. In a genre where grieving relatives are often bit-part players,
  the presence of their daughter, Lizz, pushes it above the competition. Hannah
  J Davies Widely available, episodes weekly *** The Mystic and the Mayor It’s
  an uncertain moment for the podcast world, as Wondery’s true-crime treats may
  soon be absorbed into the Amazon stable. In the meantime, enjoy what it does
  best: a ripped-from-the-headlines hoot about a French town where the mayor
  devolved his power to the local psychic. Mon dieu! Anna Richardson and Leo
  Schick host. HJD Widely available, episodes weekly *** Floodlines The
  Atlantic’s podcast about Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath returns for a
  special 20th anniversary episode, and it’s a stirring portrait of one family.
  Le-Ann Williams wants a better life for daughter Destiny, but – as host Vann R
  Newkirk II notes – “maybe she’s got it backwards … maybe they’ve got what
  other people are searching for”. HJD Widely available, out now *** The History
  Podcast: The Second Map Kavita Puri hosts a three-part series marking the 80th
  anniversary of VJ Day, and considering the events that preceded it – namely,
  Britain’s often downplayed role in the war against Japan on the Asian front.
  There are even eyewitness testimonies, which are all the more impressive given
  just how long ago these events took place. HJD Widely available, episodes
  weekly
