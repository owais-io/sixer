  Firefighters in Colorado responding to one of the largest blazes in the
  state’s history are facing gusty winds and dry conditions that are expected to
  continue to drive extreme fire behavior. More than 1,000 firefighters have
  been deployed, and while crews have gained containment on one fire, another
  has grown amid fire-friendly weather. The Lee fire, churning through dry trees
  and brush near Meeker, about 250 miles (400km) west of Denver, is now the
  fifth-largest single fire in the state’s history, according to the Colorado
  division of fire prevention and control. The area has recently endured extreme
  drought conditions, and has “volatile” fuel loads, officials said. The blaze,
  sparked by lightning on 2 August, had burned through more than 130,000 acres
  (52,000 hectares) by Monday morning and was just 7% contained. Low humidity
  and gusty winds were expected to return to the area, which combined with dry
  fuels, can cause extreme fire behavior, such as winds that carry embers over
  long distances and cause additional fires, officials aid. Another major blaze
  in the region, the Elk fire, is burning to the east of the Lee fire, and has
  scorched more than 14,000 acres and is 30% contained. Officials have said
  containment has continued to increase and that crews are working to reinforce
  existing fire lines. On Monday, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, declared a
  disaster emergency to support response efforts for the Oak fire, which is
  burning in Pagosa Springs, Archuleta county. Evacuations are in place for
  mountain communities across Garfield and Rio Blanco counties. On Saturday, the
  Rifle correctional center was evacuated “out of an abundance of caution”, the
  Colorado department of corrections said. Smoke caused by the fires has
  prompted air quality warnings. Meanwhile, in southern California, crews
  reached more than 90% containment on the Canyon fire that forced evacuations
  and destroyed seven structures after breaking out Thursday near the Los
  Angeles county and Ventura county line. Three firefighters have been injured
  in that blaze, including a battalion chief who was seriously hurt when his
  pickup truck rolled over in steep terrain. The Gifford fire, California’s
  largest blaze so far this year, has scorched nearly 120,000 acres of Santa
  Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since erupting on 1 August. It was 33%
  contained on Monday. With months left before the highest fire risks subside,
  it has already been an explosive year for fire across North America. Nearly
  all available firefighting resources are deployed in the US, as 36 large fires
  actively burn across the country. In Canada, hundreds of wildfires continue to
  burn out of control and the country is seeing its second-worst fire season on
  record. More than 18m acres has been scorched – nearly 78% more than the
  five-year average, according to data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire
  Centre (CIFFC). “This is our new reality … the warmer it gets, the more fires
  we see,” Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services,
  emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in
  Kamloops, told the Guardian. The climate crisis has intensified conditions
  that fuel fires, setting the stage for easier ignitions, rapid growth, and
  hotter, catastrophic burns that are more challenging to contain. • This
  article was amended on 11 August 2025 to correct the spelling of a town
  affected by the Lee fire. The town is Meeker, not Meaker, as an earlier
  version said.
