  The Pentagon will remove 1,350 national guard troops from Los Angeles
  originally sent to the state by the Trump administration to deal with protests
  over its immigration policies. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, ordered
  the national guard members to leave this week. A remaining 250 troops will
  stay put to protect federal personnel and property, according to the statement
  attributed to Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesperson. Two months ago, the
  Trump administration sent a mix of 5,000 members of the national guard
  andmarines to Los Angeles to suppress a wave of protests against Ice raids.
  The troops received a cold welcome from Karen Bass, the Los Angeles mayor, and
  the state governor, Gavin Newsom, protesters and community members around the
  city. California politicians argued that handling the protests should be left
  to local law enforcement. Newsom promptly filed a lawsuit against the Trump
  administration after the deployment and said that national guard members were
  also being pulled from other duties, such as drug enforcement and wildfire
  fighting. The deployment cost taxpayers an estimated $134m. Wednesday’s
  continued withdrawal was met with applause from California politicians.
  “Another win for Los Angeles tonight: 1,000 more troops are retreating,” Bass
  wrote in a post on X. “We will continue this pressure until ALL troops are out
  of L.A.” Newsom called for the demobilization of the remaining 300 national
  guard members. “The President should allow the remaining soldiers to go back
  to their families, communities, and civilian professions as doctors, law
  enforcement and teachers,” Newsom wrote in a statement. The Los Angeles Times
  reported many of the troops that came to Los Angeles found themselves fighting
  boredom due to a lack of clear directives. The Guardian found low morale and
  motivation among troops deployed in Los Angeles. A highly publicized raid on a
  mostly empty MacArthur Park yielded minimal results. The military detained and
  then released a 27-year-old man who was on his way to an appointment at the
  Department of Veterans Affairs. The Guardian also documented false claims by
  federal officials against protesters, including the dismissal of seven out of
  nine felony “assault” and “impeding” cases and an indictment naming the wrong
  defendant. The presidential administration, however, insists that troops were
  vital for keeping the peace. “We greatly appreciate the support of the more
  than 5,000 Guardsmen and Marines who mobilized to Los Angeles to defend
  Federal functions against the rampant lawlessness occurring in the city,”
  Parnell wrote in a statement.
