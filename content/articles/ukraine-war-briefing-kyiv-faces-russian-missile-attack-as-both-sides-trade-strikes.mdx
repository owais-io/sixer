  Russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday, the military
  administration of the Ukrainian capital said on the Telegram messaging app.
  Reuters’ witnesses heard a loud blast shaking the city soon after midnight.
  The reported attack comes days after Russia’s worst airstrike of the year on
  Kyiv, which killed at least 31 people, including five children, and wounded
  more than 150. Ukraine on Saturday said it hit military targets and a gas
  pipeline in drone attacks in Russia, where local authorities said three people
  were killed and two others wounded. Ukraine’s SBU security service said the
  strikes, carried out on Friday night by long-distance drones, hit a military
  airfield in the south-western town of Primorsko-Akhtarsk. They caused a fire
  in an areas where Iranian-built Shahed drones – relied on by Russia to attack
  Ukraine – were stored, the SBU said. The SBU said the strikes also hit a
  company in Russia’s southern Penza region, which it said “works for the
  Russian military-industrial complex”, making military digital networks,
  aviation devices, armoured vehicles and ships. The governor for Russia’s Penza
  region, Oleg Melnichenko, said on Telegram that one woman had been killed and
  two other people were wounded in that attack. Russia’s defence ministry said
  its air-defence systems had destroyed 112 Ukrainian drones over Russian
  territory – 34 over the Rostov region – in a nearly nine-hour period, from
  Friday night to Saturday morning. An elderly man was killed inside a house
  that caught fire due to falling drone debris in the Samara region, governor
  Vyacheslav Fedorishchev posted on Telegram. In the Rostov region, a guard at
  an industrial facility was killed after a drone attack and a fire in one of
  the site’s buildings, acting Rostov governor Yuri Sliusar said. “The military
  repelled a massive air attack during the night,” destroying drones over seven
  districts, Sliusar posted on Telegram. More than 120 firefighters were trying
  to extinguish a blaze at an oil depot in the Russian city of Sochi that was
  sparked by a Ukrainian drone attack, a regional governor said early on Sunday.
  In the Krasnodar region where Sochi is located, a fuel tank with a capacity of
  2,000 cubic metres was on fire, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.
  Rosaviatsia, Russia’s civil aviation authority, said on Telegram that flights
  were halted at Sochi’s airport to ensure air safety. Both sides deny targeting
  civilians in their strike in the war that Russia launched with a full-scale
  invasion on Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv says that its attacks inside Russia
  are aimed at destroying infrastructure key to Moscow’s war efforts and are in
  response to Russia’s relentless strikes on Ukraine. Indian oil refineries will
  continue to buy oil from Russia, officials have said, before threatened US
  sanctions next week against Moscow’s trading partners over the war in Ukraine.
  Media reports on Friday had suggested India, a big energy importer, would stop
  buying cheap Russian oil. Trump later told reporters that such a move would be
  “a good step” if true. “I understand that India is no longer going to be
  buying oil from Russia,” he said. “That’s what I heard. I don’t know if that’s
  right or not. That is a good step. We will see what happens.” Ukrainian
  authorities said on Saturday that they had arrested several politicians in
  connection with a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector,
  shortly after an uproar over the independence of anti-graft bodies. A law
  passed in late July stripped the National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and
  the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) of their
  independence and placed them under the supervision of the prosecutor general,
  himself appointed by the head of state. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on
  Thursday backtracked and restored the bodies’ independence after an outcry
  from the country’s allies and the first anti-government street demonstrations
  since Russia’s invasion. The NABU on Saturday said it and the SAP had exposed
  “a scheme for the systematic misappropriation of budget funds allocated by
  local authorities for the needs of the defence forces, as well as the receipt
  and provision of unlawful benefits on an especially large scale”. It said the
  scheme involved inflating prices for electronic warfare and drone equipment,
  and then funnelling off 30% of the contract amounts. The suspects include a
  member of parliament, heads of district and city administrations, members of
  the National Guard, and executives at defence companies. The NABU said it has
  made four arrests so far but did not identify those detained. Zelensky said in
  a statement: “I am grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work …
  It is important that anti-corruption institutions operate independently, and
  the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real
  fight against corruption.” A fire that broke out near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
  power plant after Ukrainian shelling has been brought under control, the
  Russian-installed administration of the plant in Ukraine said on Saturday.
  Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia plant in the first weeks of Russia’s
  February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have accused each other of
  firing or taking other actions that could trigger a nuclear accident. The
  plant’s administration said on Telegram that a civilian had been killed in the
  shelling, but that no plant employees or members of the emergency services had
  been injured. The station, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, is not
  operating but still requires power to keep its nuclear fuel cool.
