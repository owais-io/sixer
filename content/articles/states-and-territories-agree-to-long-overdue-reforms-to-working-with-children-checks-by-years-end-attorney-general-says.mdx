  All states and territories have agreed to introduce reforms by the end of the
  year to close a “loophole” which allowed potential child abusers to work
  across jurisdictions, the federal attorney general has announced. Following a
  meeting of state and territory attorneys general on Friday, Michelle Rowland
  announced the “long-overdue reform” to create a system that ensured those
  working with children who were “banned in one” jurisdiction were “banned in
  all”. “There are some 6m … working with children checks around Australia, and
  each of them is subject to a bespoke scheme in each state and territory – they
  are systems that do not talk to one another,” Rowland said. She said this
  created a “loophole”, which “nefarious individuals” were able to “exploit”.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It is absolutely horrific what has happened,
  it should never have happened,” Rowland said. “But we know that these
  perpetrators are smart, they will look at ways to be able to game the system,
  so that is why we are taking a comprehensive approach, working as a team to
  make sure that we get this done, so that we can prevent this from happening in
  future.” After initially suggesting it could take a year to put the necessary
  information-sharing arrangements in place to introduce the reforms, Rowland
  told reporters all jurisdictions agreed to “accelerate delivery” by the end of
  2025. She said the attorneys general also agreed to introduce stricter
  criteria on granting working with children checks (WWCCs) and to better
  information sharing to “ensure that changes to criminal history are captured
  and shared in near real time”. Work on the latter, known as “national
  continuous checking capability”, has been under way at the Australian Criminal
  Intelligence Commission since 2023, with a pilot program to be complete by the
  end of the year. However, Rowland said there would not be a move to a national
  working with children check system. Instead, she said there was a focus on
  “consistency” between state and territories. “The key issue there is time – we
  do not have a national scheme, and the states and territories administer those
  schemes,” she said. “We are looking at a way in which we can get the most
  efficient outcome, and that is by individual state schemes talking to one
  another.” In 2015, the royal commission into child abuse delivered a specific
  report on working with children checks and urged shifting to a national
  system. A Victorian ombudsman report in 2022 also highlighted “serious flaws”
  with the state’s WWCC system and urged several reforms, which are yet to be
  implemented. But the issue has come under renewed scrutiny in recent months
  after Melbourne childcare worker was charged with more than 70 offences
  relating to eight alleged victims in his care. At the time of his arrest in
  May, the employee had a valid working with children’s check, despite his
  employment being terminated by several centres. There have been several media
  reports since of glaring issues with the regulation of the WWCCs since. On
  Friday, the prime minister was asked why an ABC report earlier in the week –
  about a male childcare worker accused of grooming children and later banned
  from working in childcare – had not led to his working with children check
  being revoked. “[The system is] hopeless, and we need to do better. Quite
  clearly. And these revelations are a wake up call for state and territory
  governments in terms of the regulations, but also the Commonwealth,” Albanese
  told ABC Radio Melbourne. The shadow education minister, Jonathon Duniam, said
  the opposition welcomed the expedited timeline but warned the system needed to
  be “truly national” to avoid people slipping through the cracks. “I don’t
  think that there is an excuse for us to not nationalise these things,” Duniam
  said. “I don’t think we should accept any bureaucratic excuse that this will
  take time … we have national police checks for people who do all sorts of jobs
  in our community. We have a national register of teachers operating in this
  country right now. So why not have a national working with children check in
  place so that we can protect young people?” The Greens’ early childhood
  education spokesperson, Steph Hodgins-May, said a national working with
  children check system was the “bare minimum”, and committed to launching an
  inquiry into the early childhood education care system when parliament
  resumes. “We need real reform that acknowledges the role of those for-profit
  cowboys who are, frankly, putting profits ahead of the quality and care of our
  children by cutting corners,” she said. “Until we get to those root problems,
  this is going to be a band-aid fix that really won’t take us the whole
  distance we need to go to ensure the number one priority of keeping our kids
  safe.” Since the Victorian allegations were made public, the federal
  government has fast-tracked legislation through parliament to cut funding to
  childcare centres that fail to meet safety standards. The education minister,
  Jason Clare, announced on Friday that since the laws passed, his department
  had initiated compliance actions against 30 early childhood education and care
  services identified by the department as having failed to meet national
  quality standards “over seven or more years”. The enforcement actions don’t
  relate to child abuse or criminal allegations – but go to issues including
  play area safety, hygiene, staff training and supervision. The 30 centres have
  48 hours to tell parents about the actions, and the names of the centres will
  be published by the department on Tuesday. They then have six months to
  improve their standards, or risk having their access to the childcare subsidy
  suspended or cancelled. The Victorian government, meanwhile, has ordered an
  urgent review of childcare safety, led by former South Australian premier Jay
  Weatherill and senior bureaucrat Pamela White. Their report, which is expected
  to recommend reforms to WWCCs, is due to be handed to government on Friday.
