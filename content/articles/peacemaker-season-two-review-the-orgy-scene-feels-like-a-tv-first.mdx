  With his medicine-ball biceps and chin worthy of an Easter Island moai, the
  wrestler turned actor John Cena can actually pull off wearing a daft comic
  book outfit, shiny silver helmet and all. That’s what makes Cena’s
  spandex-clad Chris Smith AKA Peacemaker so inherently funny: he looks the part
  but is a demonstrably terrible superhero. Being a hard-charging,
  self-sabotaging meathead with a propensity for violence and a hair-trigger
  temper will never make you as beloved as Superman. But it can be highly
  entertaining to watch. To give Peacemaker his due, he is a survivor. He was
  first introduced in James Gunn’s 2021 movie The Suicide Squad, a film that
  bumped off cast members with glee, before getting his own small-screen
  spin-off overseen by Gunn in 2022. That brash and blackly comic first season
  shaded in some childhood trauma – Smith accidentally killed his older brother
  in a brawl instigated by their racist father – but also gave Peacemaker his
  first big win: saving the world from an alien invasion by sparkly butterfly
  creatures. Gunn has been on an upswing too. After being promoted to co-running
  DC Studios, he recently rebooted the entire DC superhero screen universe with
  a generally well-received new take on Superman. Back at the helm for
  Peacemaker season two, the writer and director seems keen to demonstrate that
  he has not lost his punk edge. Clark Kent may never curse, but the Peacemaker
  cast are happy to take up the sweary slack. (Notable additions to the ensemble
  include Tim Meadows as an oddball government agent and Frank Grillo as a
  ruthless colonel with a distinctly non-military pompadour.) The action picks
  up a month after the events of Superman, and Smith is struggling to parlay his
  alien invasion foiling into a sustainable superhero career. Things aren’t
  going much better for his local cohort of found family. Tetchy hacker Economos
  (Steve Agee) is being forced to surveil Peacemaker by the shady Argus agency,
  the usually sunny Adebayo (Danielle Brooks) is struggling with a breakup and
  flinty butt-kicker Emilia (Jennifer Holland) is now a pariah in the
  intelligence community. (In a fractious psych evaluation, Emilia snaps and
  calls her doctor “a fucking cunt” but quickly recovers: “In England, cunt
  means friend!”) Only semi-reformed serial killer Adrian (Freddie Stroma) seems
  to be doing OK, even if his new interest in owls verges on the obsessive.
  After a particularly crushing career setback, Smith digs out a cocaine baggie
  marked “for a rainy day” and tries to party away his pain. What follows is an
  expansive and sustained orgy scene that must have required bringing in
  intimacy coordinators by the busload. Plenty of other HBO shows have featured
  group sex scenes, but Peacemaker is the first where the post-orgy logistics of
  cleaning up and turfing participants out are addressed in a subsequent
  episode. Bubbling away beneath all this self-loathing is Peacemaker’s
  discovery that the Tardis-style storage unit he uses to stash his guns and
  helmets is actually a quantum gateway to 99 other universes, including one
  alternate reality where things turned out better for Chris Smith. Should he
  keep plugging away in a world where it feels as if he can never do anything
  right? Or rush toward a dimension where Peacemaker is beloved and has a cool
  customised motorbike called the P-Cycle? As Adebayo sagely notes: “This is
  becoming some fucked-up Twilight Zone shit.” The sporadic bursts of The
  Boys-style ultraviolence – with geysers of blood, smashed teeth and even
  eyeballs going flying – will be as much of a barrier to entry for some as the
  constant hair metal needle drops. But underneath all the crunching fight
  scenes and crass jokes there is real heart. Gunn clearly loved these damaged
  characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also
  never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest
  victories in their lives feel momentous. The show would also collapse without
  the full-body commitment of Cena. He has long nailed the petulant side of
  Peacemaker while hurling himself into the physical comedy. As the longstanding
  attraction between Smith and Emilia intensifies this season, he also gets to
  play goofily romantic. Is he a good actor, or a great one? In an upcoming
  episode there is a scene where Smith is deeply hungover and blearily begins
  checking his phone while relieving himself. Mid-stream he realises how late he
  is going to be for a vital meeting. The sight of Cena angrily shouting “PISS!”
  at himself to try to speed things up is an Emmy-worthy masterclass. Peacemaker
  season two is on Sky Max and Now in the UK and HBO Max in the US and
  Australia.
