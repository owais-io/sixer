  When the final leg of the World Surf League (WSL) regular season begins in
  Tahiti this week, Kelia Mehani Gallina will make history. Just 12 years old,
  the Tahitian local won the event trials last month to book a spot in the main
  draw, making her the youngest competitor in WSL history. She will face the
  current world No 1, Molly Picklum of Australia, and American star Lakey
  Peterson in the opening round, before celebrating her 13th birthday midway
  through the event. The contest site, Teahupo’o, is renowned as being among the
  heaviest waves in the world. But Gallina is a regular – she speaks to the
  Guardian by phone with her father, Ryan, from their home in Teahupo’o village.
  “We can see [the wave] from our bedroom,” says Ryan, who is originally from
  Hawaii (Kelia’s mother is Tahitian). Such is her local status that Kelia’s
  Instagram handle is simply @MissTeahupoo. “I’m pretty surprised,” the
  youngster admits after her trials victory. “I just can’t wait.” Her father
  shares these emotions. “We’re in shock,” he says. “We always visualised this
  happening, but not at all did we think it would happen so soon.” Kelia started
  surfing when she was three, at the suggestion of her father – himself a
  passionate surfer. “It’s always fun,” she says. “I have a lot of friends who
  surf every day too, so I’m just with them, all day, every day.” Barely a
  decade later, Kelia will surf against the best in the world. In recent years,
  Kelia has been a regular participant in Rising Tides – a WSL program that sees
  pro surfers guide and mentor young locals during a competition stop. “My
  birthday is 10 August, so it’s always been around my birthday,” she says.
  “It’s the best birthday present ever. It’s super inspiring to surf with
  [defending world champion] Caity Simmers, Molly Picklum, all those girls. I’m
  excited to have them in a heat.” On a big swell, Teahupo’o is fearsome – waves
  track thousands of kilometres across the Pacific before unloading on to a
  shallow Tahitian reef. For a decade and a half, the women’s side of the WSL
  did not feature a leg in Tahiti; the event was discontinued in 2006 reportedly
  due to injury fears, a decision that was criticised at the time as sexist.
  That was reversed in 2022 after the WSL men’s and women’s calendars were
  integrated. Last year, that decision was more than vindicated when the top
  female surfers looked at home in heaving 8-10ft Teahupo’o barrels. “It
  definitely gives me reasons to want to go on the bigger waves,” Kelia says. “I
  feel like the level of the girls is getting way better every year. I’m really
  happy to be part of that next generation.” The youngster started surfing
  Teahupo’o at four and a half years old – she can’t recall whether she was
  fearful at first. “I think so,” she says with a laugh. “It’s kind of hard to
  remember.” Ryan admits he continues to harbour some concerns, but, he says,
  “nothing out of the ordinary for a parent.” “Of course you worry,” Ryan says.
  “Like you worry when they’re crossing the street, or riding around in town,
  there’s always somewhat of a worry that comes with being a parent. But I’ve
  been about 23 years out at this wave, and feel I know it pretty intimately –
  so I pride myself in knowing when is a good time [for Kelia to surf].” The
  pair often surf together. In bigger waves – Kelia says she has previously
  surfed 12ft faces – Ryan will stay close in the water and help guide his
  daughter into the waves. “They’re not going to allow that [during
  competition],” he says. So the Mehani Gallina family are hoping the swell is
  good, but not too good, come competition day. “We’re praying the waves aren’t
  too big,” he adds. The family also take peace of mind from the fact that “the
  best life-saving water patrol in the world” will be close to hand, Ryan says.
  Not yet a teenager, Kelia says she wants to qualify for the WSL in the future
  – even if her debut appearance came earlier than expected. “That’s definitely
  the goal, to make it on tour,” she says. The Mehani Gallina family are trying
  to manage expectations, though. “We acknowledge that it is extremely difficult
  to make it to that level,” Ryan adds. “It’s a goal, but not the goal. Surfing
  is a lifestyle for us, so whether or not that happens, it’s just about being
  in the ocean, getting better every day and having something you’re passionate
  about.” In the coming days, when the buzzer goes to begin her heat, Kelia will
  make history – even before she surfs a wave. Could an upset be on the cards?
  “I’m just going to wait until the moment,” says Kelia. But Ryan is hoping that
  age and relative inexperience could work in his daughter’s favour. “There is
  really no pressure on her to do anything – no one expected her to get this
  far,” he says. “[Kelia] is the biggest underdog ever – the pressure is on [the
  other surfers in the heat]. You don’t want to lose to a 12-year-old girl.”
