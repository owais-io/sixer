  Yes yes y’all and welcome to the US Open 2025 – day four! And, as you might
  expect, there’s an absolutely indecent quantity of lovely tennis just waiting
  to envelop us in its loving arms. On Armstrong, we begin with Emma Raducanu,
  the 2021 champion – words almost as befuddling to type now as then – who meets
  Janice Tjen. Meantime, Emma Navarro meets Caty McNally – I’m looking forward
  to that one – as I am Arthur Rinderknech v Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Half
  an hour later, we’re away on Ashe, where Novak Djokovic faces Zachary Svajda,
  the young American before, over the course of the day, we’ll enjoy my match of
  the day, João Fonseca v Tomas Machac, plus my reserve match of the day, Lloyd
  Harris v Taylor Fritz. Nor is that all; indeed, all that is far from all.
  We’ve got Jessica Pegula v Anna Blinkova, Jan-Leonard Struff v Holger Rune,
  Cameron Norrie v Francisco Comesana, Jelena Ostapenko v Taylor Townsend, Elise
  Mertens v Lulu Sun and Victoria Azarenka v Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, with
  Francis Tiafoe, Mirra Andreeva, Casper Ruud, Elena Rybakina, Barbora
  Krejcikova and Belinda Bencic also featuring. Phew! In the inimitable words of
  the worst sporting chant of all time, let’s go!
