  Carlos Manuel Álvarez’s second novel is a hugely rewarding, polyphonic
  narrative of migration from Cuba. Through its characters’ rich and eccentric
  interior worlds, it gives articulation to people whose lives are often reduced
  to stereotypes and offers a new vision of migration. False War is comprised
  mostly of 13 interconnected storylines, which alternate irregularly in short
  episodes. The stories have different timelines and vary significantly in their
  portrayals of an array of characters, many from Havana, “a city of many stray
  sadnesses”. The novel is also broken up at the midpoint by two “Interludes”.
  In the second of these, an “exile” who has just come home “doesn’t understand
  yet what kind of plot his return has planted in him”. This line resonates
  across the novel’s dense, fragmented narrative. Characters struggle to
  understand the trajectories of their lives, the currents they are moving with
  or against, the plots they’ve fallen into or that have been “planted” in them.
  The line also speaks to the novel’s structure more generally, as connections
  between the stories and their sometimes overlapping characters emerge slowly
  and unexpectedly, combining genre modes and confounding conventions of plot.
  False War doesn’t dwell on dangerous passages, precarious border crossings,
  struggles of integration, or detention (though one character briefly recalls
  his harrowing incarceration at Guantánamo Bay). It certainly doesn’t diminish
  the many violences inflicted on migrants, but is nevertheless eager to move
  away from stereotypical scenes. Instead, Álvarez is interested in the
  meandering thoughts of his characters as they drift around Miami Beach or the
  outer zones of Havana, and in tracking their impulses, desires, obsessions and
  the idiosyncratic stories they share with each other. The novel specialises in
  evocative accounts of the unspectacular – from the opening imagery of the
  “primordial gas stations of America”, to a man entertaining himself in a
  doctor’s office by sardonically reading a travel magazine article on “how to
  choose the best cruise ship experience”. There are moments of violence and
  loss, but they are often muted by layers of storytelling. In fact, the power
  of the novel derives from its depictions of a kind of stuckness that is less
  related to geography than to the psychological borders that separate people,
  and to failures of communication. False War’s interest in the ostensibly
  ordinary lives of its characters extends to unheralded places - or at least
  the idea of them. Though the journeys its characters have made or plan to make
  are generally from Havana to Miami, often via Mexico City (with episodes in
  New York, Berlin and Paris, too), it is quick to remind us that “none of these
  places are far-off”. Indeed, as “the exile” poignantly notes, the “real
  far-flung place is the rural village, this little piece of land in the middle
  of nowhere. There’s no proof of its existence, and therefore it is truly
  extraordinary to be here, where his sister never got to leave, and where, by
  extension, she never was.” The novel of interlocking stories is not a new
  thing, but Álvarez’s narrative is multiply fragmented. Its strands include
  several distinct first-person narratives, close and distant third person, and
  second person address. Their temporalities shift, and some strands even have
  distinct genres; one is autofictional and another noirish, for instance.
  Nevertheless, a coherence emerges through the autofictional strand, which
  shares its title with the novel. Late on, its narrator reflects on the nature
  of the book he is writing and stories he is trying to tell: “the coherence of
  this splintered emotional grammar could only be maintained on the page, as
  text, with me as the magnet unable to attract all the fragments to myself and
  therefore going where the fragments happened to be”. Though this illuminates
  the organisational logic of False War by naming its ostensible centre, the
  book remains capacious, irreducible and resistant to national allegory. The
  interconnected stories of its often-floundering individuals are never meant to
  add up to a coherent story of the struggle of a people. Yet a loose sense of
  shared experience does come into view through oblique metaphors. In one late
  scene, a woman called Elis, who appears in four story strands, walks into her
  closet at the end of a long day and falls asleep standing up. When her partner
  arrives home with their children, she stays still and hidden, for reasons she
  doesn’t entirely understand. This is typical of the novel’s use of metaphor.
  Elis isn’t sure why she has gone into the closet, “has no way of justifying
  why she was there”, but decides to stay, “to see how it all ended up”. It is
  easy to imagine many of the novel’s characters in this situation: seeking
  temporary sanctuary, unsure of what is to come, and unable to decode their own
  actions. False War is a rich and capacious novel that has much to say about
  our contemporary moment. • False War by Carlos Manuel Álvarez is published by
  Fitzcarraldo (£14.99). To support the Guardian order your copy at
