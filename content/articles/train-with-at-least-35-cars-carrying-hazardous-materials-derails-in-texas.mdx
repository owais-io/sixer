  Emergency services responded to a derailed train in Palo Pinto county, Texas,
  on Tuesday afternoon, with officials noting that nearly three dozen cars were
  carrying hazardous materials. “A Train has derailed at the Coalville Rd
  Bridge. Multiple cars off the track on their side. No cars are leaking
  contents. No injuries reported,” Palo Pinto county emergency services district
  1 said in a social media post. They noted that crews and fire officials were
  on the scene cautiously mitigating the damage and hazards. They also said that
  the incident is being treated as a “HazMat situation”. No evacuations have
  been made. Officials said the derailment happened at about 1.45pm local time
  over a railroad bridge on Coalville Road, north of state Highway 193 and about
  2 miles east of Gordon. Union Pacific said in a statement provided to local
  news station WFAA that 35 cars derailed. Officials told CBS that “35 train
  cars carrying hazardous materials are involved, but none of them show signs of
  leaking at the scene”. Video footage from the scene showed a grass fire and
  heavy smoke rising around the mangled train cars piled up off the tracks, with
  fire crews responding with hoses. Union Pacific said the incident is under
  investigation. • This article was amended on 15 August 2025 to correct the
  highway number to 193; an earlier version stated it was Highway 183.
