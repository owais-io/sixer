  tenure

  An extra layer of poignancy was associated with the death of Jimmy Bone this
  week. An individual who made a huge contribution to Scottish club football,
  the robust forward’s solitary goal for his country came in Copenhagen’s
  original Parken. Denmark 1-4 Scotland in October 1972. The Scots, then briefly
  under the management of Tommy Docherty, had set themselves on course to
  qualify for the 1974 World Cup, ending an absence of 16 years. Come Friday,
  Copenhagen is again the venue. The painful wait this time stretches back to
  1998. Togo, North Korea, Panama, Saudi Arabia and Wales have featured in the
  World Cup since Scotland last did. Steve Clarke will shortly become the
  longest-serving Scotland manager by games overseen. Scotland have a Ballon
  d’Or nominee – in respect of Scott McTominay’s country represented if not of
  birth – and six games to determine their 2026 fate. Is this to be Clarke’s
  slowest of final steps or a lusty skip into the pantheon of Scotland greats?
  The answer will be apparent by November. Clarke has 540 minutes to deliver
  what would by a distance be the finest achievement of his career. Nobody
  should underestimate the scale of this task. It has been clear for some time
  that Clarke views the end of this World Cup cycle, and his contract, as a
  natural time to conclude a tenure which began in 2019. Whether that inevitable
  departure is healthy is a point for debate. The more serious, lingering notion
  the 62-year-old has to disprove is that he is presiding over a team that
  peaked long before the numbing experience of Germany and the last Euros.
  Scotland rallied over the latter stages of their subsequent Nations League
  campaign but the paucity of performance in losing home games against Greece
  and Iceland, conceding three goals in each, had red flags flying high above
  Hampden Park. Clarke’s rare public pronouncements have not quietened grumbling
  in the stands, which exists partly through familiarity breeding contempt.
  Greece, an emerging youthful force, again lie in wait in this qualifying
  section. Scotland’s desire to end their World Cup hiatus is palpable and how
  the tournament would benefit from a tartan invasion. Clarke’s success in
  raising standards is similarly plain. However, there are unavoidable reasons
  for scepticism. So many of them, in fact, that Clarke’s challenge, starting
  against Denmark on Friday, is substantial. The Scottish Football Association
  will revert to panic mode when it eventually comes to sourcing Clarke’s
  successor. The lack of discernible playing talent will render this job a hard
  sell. Scotland’s clubs either play a part in or do not care about the broader
  picture, as the lengths gone to in sourcing journeymen in the recent transfer
  window shows. Scotland’s goalkeeping scenario is more national emergency than
  dilemma. Liam Kelly does not play for Rangers, Zander Clark surely will soon
  not be playing for Hearts and Angus Gunn has had no game time since lasting
  seven minutes of that loss to Iceland in June. Clarke will likely turn to Gunn
  against Denmark, which is akin to damning the 29-year-old with faint praise.
  The Nottingham Forest back-up keeper has failed to convince in Scotland
  colours. The Scotland central defence is weak in international context. That
  Andy Robertson is no longer a guaranteed starter at left-back for Liverpool
  need not be a huge issue, but it suggests his star is fading. Kieran Tierney’s
  return to Celtic has been notable only because of obvious physical
  limitations, which led on Thursday to his withdrawal through injury. The
  attack is either untried at this level (Kieran Bowie and George Hirst) or
  lacks scoring punch (Che Adams). Hence continued reliance on Lyndon Dykes.
  Giddy excitement over Ben Gannon-Doak ignores the fact the 19-year-old still
  has to gain a foothold in club football, as Clarke has regularly pointed out.
  There are strands of hope. Aaron Hickey’s return after a horrible period out
  with serious hamstring problems should alleviate worries at right-back, where
  Scotland had been scratching for a solution. The midfield, spearheaded by
  McTominay, is more than adequate for international football. Clarke’s
  conundrum there is in accommodating so many talented players. It must also be
  recognised that Denmark away is precisely the sort of fixture Scotland tend to
  revel in, with backs against the wall and organisation not in doubt. Even a
  point would be a fine outcome before Monday evening’s must-/surely-will-win
  meeting with Belarus in deepest Hungary. Scotland’s last meeting with Denmark
  four years ago witnessed arguably the finest performance of Clarke’s tenure
  and a 2-0 win. In 1972, Scotland were on the crest of a wave. Billy Bremner,
  Martin Buchan, Peter Lorimer; Kenny Dalglish and Joe Harper replaced Lou
  Macari and Bone. Copenhagen triggered a run where the country reached six out
  of seven World Cups. There are parallels as another section begins in the
  Danish capital. It is just that the fundamental differences feel so hard to
  shake off.
