  Although he came up just short in one of the most thrilling events of last
  weekend’s US Track and Field Outdoor Championships, Miguel Jimenez-Vergara
  could still take satisfaction in a crowd-pleasing performance. Competing for
  the first time at the famous Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, the 24-year-old
  waged a tense tactical war over 5000m with the US’s fastest wheelchair racers.
  Entering the final lap, Jimenez-Vergara vaporized a tightly packed field with
  a ferocious acceleration that energized the crowd. Only one competitor could
  rise to the challenge: reigning Paralympic gold medalist Daniel Romanchuk.
  Jimenez-Vergara still led by a wheel as they rocketed through the final turn
  at more than 20 mph; Romanchuk caught him in the final 50m and won by a tenth
  of a second. It was an exhilarating show, and worthy of the big-league
  setting. But Jimenez-Vergara rejected attempts to spin it as a triumph. “I
  just want to win,” he said. “I’m not here to soak up the fans or soak up the
  atmosphere. I know you probably want me to say I’m excited to be at Hayward
  and get more visibility [for disabled athletes]. And we do need more eyes on
  us. But for me, I’ll race in the parking lot. I just want to beat the guy next
  to me. I just want to be the best.” That sums up both the promise and the
  pitfalls of the weekend’s historic championship. For the first time, USA Track
  and Field showcased America’s Paralympic talent on the sport’s biggest stage,
  side by side with their better-known, better-paid Olympic teammates. It’s a
  clear win for parasports equity, one that recognizes disabled competitors as
  supremely gifted athletes rather than novelty acts. But it’s a largely
  symbolic victory, and glaringly overdue. Achieving the type of success
  Jimenez-Vergara hungers for – global dominance in paratrack – will require
  more than splashy gestures toward inclusion. It will take a level of money and
  commitment far beyond what Team USA has previously invested in parasports.
  There’s urgency to post a high medal count when the Paralympics come to US
  soil in Los Angeles three years from now. But time is short, and talk is
  cheap. “Seeing the integration actually happen is really cool,” says sprinter
  Jarryd Wallace, a four-time Paralympian and longtime advocate for equity. “It
  shows how much growth there has been. But in order to make the heights climb
  even higher, we’ve got to keep asking questions. No one really knows the right
  direction yet. We’re finding out what the needs are, what the resources and
  opportunities are. And I think it’s going to catapult us to places we’ve never
  seen US parasport before.” The places we have seen US parasport before can
  generously be described as third-rate. Until last year, national championships
  and Paralympic trials were routinely staged at high school and
  community-college tracks that lacked accessibility accommodations for the
  athletes, media hookups for journalists, and comfort amenities for the public.
  The stands (if there were any) were inevitably empty. The tracks themselves
  were often an embarrassment. “The venues haven’t been so great in the past,”
  says Tatyana McFadden, one of US paratrack’s most recognizable stars and the
  winner of 22 Paralympic track and field medals, a US record. “Long-jump pits
  have not been the right size. There have been holes in the track and not
  enough water for the athletes.” The 2024 national meet and Paralympic trials
  were held at top-notch facilities – but only after Paralympians filed a formal
  grievance following the 2023 national championships. Going forward, it’ll be
  Hayward Field every year. “It’s nice when you can just go out and compete
  without worrying if there’s a divot in your lane,” says McFadden. “It’s good
  to be treated like elite athletes. We deserve this.” US paraathletes also
  deserve the same pay as their non-disabled peers, and they’ve made some
  progress on that front – since 2021, Paralympic medal bonuses have been
  equivalent to Olympic bonuses (they were one-fifth as large previously). But
  performance-based compensation in other major para events continues to lag. So
  do stipends for travel, training, equipment, and living expenses. Given their
  relative dearth of resources, US paratrack athletes have compiled an admirable
  record of international success. While they haven’t matched the preeminence of
  their Olympic comrades – who have led the world in track medals (overall and
  gold) at every Olympics since 1992 – US Paralympians have brought home 212
  track medals this century, more than every nation except China. They hold
  dozens of world records. It’s an impressive ledger, but other countries have
  been catching up or surging ahead in recent cycles. Since 2000, China has won
  twice as many Paralympic track medals as the United States. Brazil has
  invested heavily in parasports since hosting the 2016 Paralympics; last summer
  it nearly matched Team USA in overall track medals and won the same number of
  golds. Great Britain, Russia, and European countries have vastly expanded
  their paraathletic recruitment and training initiatives. And nearly every
  nation has unified their para and able-bodied track programs into a single
  governing body – a step the United States took belatedly this year, when US
  Track and Field absorbed the paratrack wing. That organizational merger
  formalized a de facto fusion that’s been happening for decades. US Paralympic
  and Olympic athletes routinely train and travel together, share coaches and
  sponsors, and regard each other as peers. “I moved to the Olympic Training
  Center in 2005, and Al Joyner was my coach,” says April Holmes, a trailblazing
  Paralympic sprinter who now serves as interim CEO of SafeSport USA. “I trained
  with all of his [Olympic] athletes. There was already a conversation back then
  – ‘Why aren’t our Nationals together?’ The administration finally caught up to
  what was happening on the track.” “The rest of the world has been doing it,
  and we should be doing it too,” adds shotputter Josh Cinnamo, a world
  record-holder and member of Team USA’s Athletes Commission. “If we’re going to
  speak like we’re one organization, then let’s be one organization.” Nobody in
  the US wants to see China dominate Team USA on the Paralympic track in three
  years. But it may take the Americans longer than that to catch up. While
  top-tier US paraathletes such as McFadden, Romanchuk, Ezra Frech, Hunter
  Woodhall, and Brittni Mason can compete with anyone in the world, America’s
  talent pipeline is nowhere near as productive on the Paralympic side as on the
  Olympic side. “We are missing a bridge between junior level competition and
  the international level,” says retired Paralympian Amanda McGrory, a
  seven-time medalist who now provides color commentary on NBC Universal’s
  paratrack coverage. “After you win your state or regional championship,
  there’s nowhere to go. Where do you find a coach? How do you make that jump
  from high school or collegiate competition to the world-championship level?
  There hasn’t been a lot of direction for most people. That’s where we really
  need some support.” Jimenez-Vergara illustrates the obstacles athletes face.
  After piling up national championships and international medals in his teens,
  he floundered for several years, training on his own with sporadic coaching.
  “I was trying to get to the Tokyo Paralympics, but I didn’t know how,” he
  says. “It just wasn’t happening. I just didn’t have the speed.” He might have
  remained stuck if his old junior coach hadn’t brokered an introduction to US
  Paralympic track coach Joaquim Cruz. That eventually led to a berth at the US
  Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California, which made
  an immediate and dramatic impact. “I stopped viewing myself as just a
  wheelchair racer,” Jimenez-Vergara explains. “Being around all the sprinters,
  the throwers, the jumpers, I realized that I am a track athlete. That meant I
  had to act like one. I had to start doing the track things these other guys
  had been doing for years and years.” He took advantage of the personal
  trainer, gym, nutritionist, sports psychologist, and other forms of support
  he’d always lacked access to. The effects became clear in 2023, when
  Jimenez-Vergara won a gold and two silvers at the Parapan American Games, a
  standard proving ground for emerging US Paralympians. This season he’s staged
  a running back-and-forth duel with his one-time idol, Romanchuk, typified by
  the tight finish in last weekend’s 5000m. By 2028, he may be ready to
  challenge for a Paralympic podium. There are plenty of prospects like
  Jimenez-Vergara who are still out there floundering, and the USATF hasn’t yet
  built a system for finding and developing them. It will take an aggressive
  recruiting blitz for the US to have any chance of running down the Chinese.
  “USA Track and Field has an established model of how to identify talent and
  get them to the next level,” McGrory says. “And I think that’s replicable on
  the Paralympic side. China has done a really good job at discovering and
  developing young talent. It makes them hard to catch. But that’s where USA
  Track and Field can help.” “USATF just needs to do what they do well,” adds
  Wallace. “They just need to lean in to who they are.” Bringing the Para Track
  Nationals to Hayward Field was a necessary first step, but not a sufficient
  one. Team USA still has a lot of race left to run. Larry Borowsky is the
