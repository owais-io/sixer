  The morning begins with a sense of anticipation – the calm before 1,200lbs of
  explosives detonate a stream culvert buried 10ft in Alaska’s Tongass national
  forest. Jamie Daniels, 53, and his crew of Tlingit forestry workers take cover
  in a glade of alders. A few minutes earlier, together with the US Forest
  Service and a Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition (SAWC) watershed scientist,
  they fed high-grade explosives into the galvanized steel culvert on a 40ft
  sled made of spruce trees. The goal now is to vaporize it, along with the
  rocks on top. Crouched 1,000ft away from the blast site, Jack Greenhalgh, the
  US Forest Service master blaster veteran, shouts: “Fire in the hole!” He
  presses a remote detonator. Seconds later, four 50lb bags of ammonium nitrate
  and fuel oil (Anfo) go off. A boom echoes across the valley, and the air goes
  liquid as a shockwave sweeps over the group, causing workers to grip hard
  hats. Football-sized splinters of granite shoot into the sky. Leaves flutter
  to the ground. A cloud of acrid smoke blows over. “Stand by until we clear the
  area,” Greenhalgh mumbles, climbing out from behind his berm to inspect the
  damage – or success, depending on how one looks at it. The area where the
  group works is called Cube Cove, a 22,000-acre (8,900-hectare) addition to the
  1m-acre Kootznoowoo wilderness on Admiralty Island, where the Tlingit people
  have lived, hunted and fished for at least 10,000 years. The wilderness makes
  up a chunk of the 17m-acre Tongass – by far the largest national forest in the
  United States. The Tlingit have long considered Admiralty Island, or
  Kootznoowoo, as sacred ground – a place of spiritual significance, ancestral
  knowledge and connection to a traditional subsistence lifestyle.
  Chartreuse-colored leaves of the spiny devil’s club, mustard-colored seaweed
  on the rocks and citrus-scented spruce tips create a distinct rainforest
  aroma. Kootznoowoo means “fortress of the bear”, a fitting name for a
  landscape home to the highest density of brown bears in North America. The
  landscape carries the marks of centuries of stewardship – from strips of
  yellow cedar used for ceremonial baskets to totem poles reflecting intricate
  clan histories. Eagles soar high above, chalky heads on pivot as they watch
  for herring or juvenile salmon. This morning, Daniels wears a bright orange
  safety helmet, his hands calloused from carving a 12in (30cm) block of Sitka
  spruce into a brown bear’s head. He lives in Angoon, 15 miles (24km) south of
  Cube Cove along the coast of the island, population 341. His clan house is
  shd’een hit, the Steel house, and he comes from Deisheetaan Naahaachuneidii,
  the original Raven Beaver clan of the Edge of the Nation people. Daniels
  emerges onto the old logging road, and gestures across the valley. “All of
  this, it’s not just land to us. It’s our ancestors’ land. We’re here doing
  more than just fixing roads or removing culverts – we’re reconnecting with our
  history, our identity and our future. Every culvert we remove, that’s a
  promise to our children that the land will heal.” In the 1970s, Daniels’s
  relatives along with others from Angoon fought to protect the island from
  clearcutting, holding bake sales, bingo games and raffles to fund trips to
  Washington DC. In 1978, elders met with Jimmy Carter. In 1980, the Alaska
  National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) formalized protections for
  the Kootznoowoo wilderness, now part of the Admiralty Island national
  monument. However, that designation came with an asterisk: the sale of 22,890
  acres of ancestral Tlingit hunting and fishing grounds to the Shee Atiká
  Corporation, one of the 13 Native corporations created during the Alaska
  Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971. Over the next three decades, more than
  80% of that land was clearcut. Culverts, like the one the team is blowing up
  today, were inserted, blocking the passage of baby salmon upriver. In 2020,
  the forest service purchased the Cube Cove land from Shee Atiká for $18m. The
  agency, alongside Kootznoowoo Inc, the Indigenous corporation based in Angoon,
  and SAWC, embarked on a five-year project to restore ecological functions,
  reconnect streams and support the traditional practices of the Tlingit people.
  The addition of Cube Cove signified the largest transfer of land into formal
  wilderness designation in the forest service’s history. “The purchase of this
  land opened a door,” Daniels reflects. “It gave us the chance to reconnect
  with these lands in a way that honors our ancestors and what they knew – how
  to live in harmony with nature, not dominate it.” When he was growing up in
  Angoon, Daniels recalls, his uncles and cousins talked about hunting and
  fishing in the area before the clearcutting. “My grandmother spoke of a ‘small
  sockeye run’ from here. I always thought she was talking about just a few
  fish. But actually, it’s thousands of fish – just kokanee salmon, which look
  like small sockeye.” Since 2022, Daniels and his crew – including his
  24-year-old son Justin; 33-year-old Roger Williams; and 41-year-old Walt
  Washington – have been working to undo decades of damage. “We’re trying to get
  this forest back on its feet,” Daniels explains. “But it’s not just the trees.
  We’re restoring the entire ecosystem: the fish, the wildlife and the cultural
  traditions connected to this land.” A legacy of restoration Following the
  all-clear from Greenhalgh, SAWC watershed scientist Kelsey Dean slings a
  forest service Pulaski – part ax and part adze – over her shoulder and follows
  the old logging road to the blast site. She describes dense thickets of spruce
  as “dog hair trees” where deer can’t forage, and bears can’t hunt deer. This
  six-day hitch we’re participating in is just the second blasting session in a
  much larger effort. At the end of five years, the team will have removed 80 of
  the 89 culverts left by loggers, and three bridges, Dean says. “We’re
  restoring habitat, improving hydrologic function and strengthening the land’s
  resilience. After that, it’s hands off,” she says, releasing the Pulaski to
  underline the point. Up ahead, a reddish-brown haze settles over the blast
  site. The crew gathers along the banks and stares into a triangular trench
  where the culvert once ran. Sean Rielly, a former wilderness ranger and forest
  service recreation specialist, slaloms down the mud and begins removing shards
  of the shattered culvert. Daniels and his crew follow, pushing boulders out of
  the new streambed. Suddenly, the goop of mud and alder leaves releases,
  flooding downhill. After an hour of work, a small mountain stream flows
  freely. “Now,” Dean says, “we watch for fish.” The fish are anadromous, she
  explains – a fancy word that means being born in freshwater, living in
  saltwater, then returning to freshwater to lay and fertilize eggs. Their
  decaying bodies provide food for the carnivorous spruce, hemlock and cedar
  trees in a healthy stand of old growth. The salmon also sustain the brown
  bears prowling the island, their coats glossy with salmon oil, their humps
  shifting as they patrol the rivers, waiting for the salmon to arrive. The Cube
  Cove project reaches its midpoint at a moment when the Trump administration
  renews logging efforts in the Tongass. In June, the US Department of
  Agriculture announced plans to remove the Roadless Rule protections, exposing
  7m acres of the Tongass to extensive clearcuts. Ecologists warn that cutting
  much of the old growth could release massive amounts of carbon stored in the
  trees. In fact, Dean says, when federal funding dried up, Cube Cove progress
  stalled. Luckily, SAWC was able to use wetlands mitigation money from the
  state of Alaska to account for the shortfall. “It’s unfortunate, what’s
  happening. The region is just now starting to recover from the violence of
  clearcutting,” says Rob Cadmus, director of SAWC. “At Cube Cove, what we’re
  doing essentially is cleaning up the mess left from logging. Going back to
  those timber bonanza days would be unconscionable, from an economic,
  environmental and psychic standpoint.” Federal subsidies have long made
  old-growth logging in the Tongass artificially profitable. By selling timber
  below market value and covering high costs like road building and
  transportation, the government incentivizes larger logging companies from the
  lower 48 to cut down trees, despite the fact that south-east Alaska’s economy
  is shifting toward eco-tourism and fishing – industries that depend on
  preserving the Tongass intact, rather than transforming the mountains into a
  moonscape, with no habitat left for salmon to spawn. As the crew works with
  hand tools, Dean inspects the flow of water, while Greenhalgh examines the
  composition of dirt. The two assess whether a second “cleanup shot” of
  explosives might be necessary before abandoning the site. Hand tools can take
  care of the rest, they decide. As the sun sets over the mouth of the valley,
  the group begins a 3.5-mile hike along the logging road back to the ATVs and
  forest service truck. Along the way, Daniels nods toward an alternating series
  of oven-mitt-shaped prints in the ground – evidence of the island’s apex
  predators. “Bear have survived here for thousands of years,” he says. “And so
  have we. All of that makes what’s happening today feel really personal.”
  Rielly catches up and talks about all the time he spent behind a desk
  justifying the need for mechanized equipment and explosives and the minimum
  tool necessary to help the region’s recovery. In 2024, a youth group from
  Angoon removed a culvert barely beneath the ground using only standard forest
  service hand tools: Pulaskis, shovels, mattocks and rakes. The effort took
  seven days. “If we don’t do this work, the land will continue to degrade.
  Culverts clog, landslides are triggered, watersheds are blocked,” Rielly says.
  “This is the only way to get the job done quickly, especially in such remote
  terrain.” Through the scrim of spruce saplings, stumps of ancient old-growth
  loom: cedar, hemlock and spruce recorded at more than 1,000 years old. The
  group crosses the Ward Creek bridge, held in place by steel girders 8ft wide
  covered by creosote timbers. These will be removed at the end of the project,
  when the crew erases their footprints. On the other side of the bridge,
  Daniels, Washington and Williams hop on the ATVs, while the rest of the group
  pile into the truck for the 12-mile trip back to camp. After showers in the
  ocean, the group congregates around a driftwood bonfire on the beach, where
  thousands of logs were once dumped and rafted together, on the way to the
  mill. Dean sips from a can of lime sparkling water – a treat in the remote
  area. Dressed now in flannel pajamas, Washington perches on a rock. He
  describes his work in the forest as engaging in a cycle of “destruction and
  renewal”. “The land will heal itself if left alone,” he says. “But sometimes
  you have to set a bone before it can heal properly. I know that this hard work
  we’re doing out here is for my children, and for their children down the
  line.” “What you’re seeing here is a version of the next generation of
  conservation – partnerships that connect people, place and purpose,” Cadmus of
  SAWC says. “When we’re out here working side by side, we build a bond that’s
  stronger than words. At the end of the day, that’s what heals us. We’re all in
  service to the land.” • This article was amended on 18 August 2025 because an
  earlier version described anadromous fish as those that spawn and then die. In
  fact anadromous means being born in freshwater, living in saltwater, then
  returning to freshwater to lay and fertilize eggs. Also, the culverts are made
  from galvanized steel, not aluminum.
