  India Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001) It is often said that there are
  two religions in India: cinema and cricket. Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India
  blends the two with such panache that, upon its release, movie theatres became
  stadiums, with audiences cheering and dancing in their seats when the
  underdogs (a ragtag team of Indian villagers) defeat their masters (a far
  superior British team led by a tyrannical racist captain who wants to inflict
  a ruinous land tax on them). It’s 1893, and a game of cricket transforms into
  an outsized battle between good and evil, coloniser and oppressed. Director
  and co-writer Ashutosh Gowariker and leading man and producer Aamir Khan
  created a film that revels in specifically Indian storytelling. There are
  joyous, colourful song and dance sequences (music by AR Rahman), an aching
  love triangle, a strong mother figure and a key life lesson: sach aur saahas
  hai jiske man main ant mein jeet usiki rahe (ultimately, the person who has
  truth and courage in his heart wins). Lagaan – also only the third Indian film
  ever to be nominated for an Oscar – runs for three hours 44 mins. It is not
  for the timid. This is big, brilliant, blissful entertainment with a throbbing
  heart. Anupama Chopra Mexico Canoa: A Shameful Memory (1976) When asked to
  name a film that represents Mexican cinema, the go-to choice is to turn to
  films from the Golden Age of the 1930s to 1950s, which offered idealised,
  picturesque visions of the country. Canoa breaks with that image entirely, yet
  it stands as one of the most essential films in the country’s history.
  Directed by Felipe Cazals and shot in faux-documentary style, Canoa is based
  on real events: it reconstructs the 1968 lynching of five university employees
  who were mistaken for communist agitators in a remote village. The village
  priest, claiming to defend God but intent on preserving his own power, becomes
  the engine of hysteria, warning of “communists” with flags “red as hellfire
  and black as sin”. The outcome is revealed early: corpses on the ground, the
  violence already done. Canoa’s ominous setting and unreliable narrators would
  be enough to make it a masterclass in suspense. But its force lies in how
  those tools expose a deeper national unease. Cazals, once a maverick for
  refusing to idealise or folklorise Mexico, is now seen as one of its most
  vital directors. Canoa not only broke with cinematic tradition; it anticipated
  present-day Mexican cinema, which increasingly turns toward the violence
  overtaking the country, the impunity surrounding it and the sense of
  vulnerability among its citizens. Fernanda Solórzano France La Bataille de
  Solférino (Age of Panic; 2013) Although her 30-minute film Two Ships won best
  European short at the 2012 Berlinale, the director Justine Triet was not
  nominated for any of the major prize categories at Cannes the following year
  for her first full-length feature Age of Panic. And yet, to just watch the
  film – to really watch it – is to feel that cinema itself was coming off its
  hinges. This story of a separated couple racing around Paris with their young
  children wrenched the French psychological drama away from its standard tropes
  of bourgeois arguments in flats or picturesque cafes. Set against the
  unpredictable backdrop of a tense national election night, the film is carried
  along by stressful waves of crisis-ridden energy in overspilling crowds. The
  intimate and the political constantly bump up against each other through
  sudden and sublime crescendos. What followed – Victoria, Sibyl and the Palme
  d’Or-winning Anatomy of a Fall – blasted Triet into the spotlight. She is
  among a new generation of women film-makers – alongside Céline Sciamma,
  Rebecca Zlotowski, Valérie Donzelli and Alice Diop – who have in their own way
  renewed the French cultural imagination. It is now much less tentative or
  narrowly naturalistic in outlook, and less indebted to the New Wave. With only
  36,000 tickets sold in France, Age of Panic was a commercial flop. Still, if
  you were going to write an official counter-history of the films capturing a
  “French touch”, it would be an inarguable milestone. Didier Péron The
  Philippines Kakabakaba Ka Ba? (Will Your Heart Beat Faster?; 1980) Tell any
  Filipino the title of this film and chances are, they’ll let out a chuckle.
  It’s a play on the rhythmic repetition of “kaba” (worry): the title’s
  rapid-fire syllables mimic the fast beats of an anxious heart. It’s a
  linguistic joke that simply vanishes with translation. As such, Mike de Leon’s
  rock opera comedy can be considered an inside joke. Music, drugs, the Chinese
  mafia and the Japanese yakuza converge around a quartet of teenagers led by
  Filipino acting legend Christopher de Leon after his character unwittingly
  smuggles opium in a cassette tape. The laughs come from deliriously
  over-the-top villains who represent the foreign forces shaping and
  manipulating the Philippine economy, all vying to retrieve the contraband. It
  revels in meta moments, from subtitle manipulation and dubbing shenanigans to
  a scene in which nuns in fishnet stockings sing about bread. It takes jabs at
  imperialism, satirises the Catholic church, and promotes the idea that stoned
  teenagers can save the day. Garnering the ire of real-life priests, nuns and
  the board of censors at the time of its release, this film didn’t just stretch
  the boundaries of the second golden age of Philippine cinema – it gleefully
  obliterated them. Ryan Oquiza Kenya Nusu Maisha Ya Nairobi (Nairobi Half Life;
  2012) In Nairobi Half Life, by Kenyan film-maker David “Tosh” Gitonga, a young
  movie seller and aspiring actor leaves his rural home for the capital to
  pursue an acting career. He is robbed of his possessions on his first day and
  ends up getting entangled in crime to survive. He starts living a double life:
  stealing and mugging as a gang member, and rehearsing a play as he chases his
  acting dream. The film is a gritty portrayal of life in the city and how
  crime, corruption and class divisions affect society. It showcases the
  spirited energy of urban life in Kenya and powerfully captures the dreams of
  young people and the struggles they face to succeed. The film is rooted in
  Kenya’s cinematic tradition of storytelling, which often focuses on local
  stories that explore social themes. With its depth and authenticity, it was
  the country’s first submission to the best international film Oscar, and was a
  distinct addition to Kenya’s crime dramas, a prevalent genre in the country’s
  cinema. Carlos Mureithi Argentina Relatos Salvajes (Wild Tales; 2014) There’s
  fizz and froth in Damián Szifron’s six tales of revenge, which capture the
  danger of a nation teetering on the edge of a breakdown. Martín Rejtman’s The
  Magic Gloves may have captured the chaos of Argentina’s 2001 financial crisis
  with a slyer absurdism, but Szifron’s compact sketches – which range from the
  poisoning of a loan shark to a wedding from hell – expose a plethora of ills
  across Argentinian society in both urban and rural landscapes. Class
  inequalities, labyrinthine bureaucracy, institutional corruption and toxic
  masculinity all rear their ugly heads in a film where characters are trapped
  in a violent cycle of repetition, evoking the tangled narratives of Jorge Luis
  Borges. A top-notch cast, including the Argentinian everyman Ricardo Darín –
  the face of many of the best homegrown films of the 21st century, from the
  newly remastered Nine Queens to the Oscar-winning The Secret in Their Eyes –
  shape a motley crew of characters whose lines have become unlikely
  catchphrases in Argentina, where the film broke box office records. Realised
  in an in-your-face colour palette, the film may not have the subtlety of
  compatriot Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless Woman – a film Szifron ingeniously
  references – or the narrative ambition of Mariano Llinás’s La Flor, but its
  exuberance and dark humour are rooted in a playful Argentinian storytelling
  tradition where nothing can be taken at surface level. Maria Delgado Turkey
  Umut (Hope; 1970) A man, a cart, a dry tree. Decades later, Umut remains
  urgent. It’s the story of a poor coachman called Cabbar chasing a lost
  treasure. Desperation turns into madness: the film pushes us deeper into
  magical thinking, from harsh reality to myth. Written, directed and acted by
  Yilmaz Güney, the film’s fierce rejection of individual salvation and
  neorealist lens transforms everyday visuals – a dusty landscape, boys on
  rented bicycles, faces of workers – into political statements. Shot in black
  and white, the film’s single dry tree becomes a haunting symbol, a promise
  that never comes true. The system keeps failing to protect the vulnerable,
  leaving helpless people praying to stones and begging healers for redemption.
  Current Turkish film-makers from Nuri Bilge Ceylan to Emin Alper and Yeşim
  Ustaoğlu carry on Güney’s legacy. The men in Ceylan’s Once Upon a Time in
  Anatolia dig for a buried corpse in order to find a truth, while the vast
  landscape similarly resonates the inner emptiness and existential dread. In
  the wonderful debut by Murat Firatoglu, One of Those Days When Hemme Dies,
  Turkey’s Oscar entry this year, a red tomato plain is a site of desperation
  and a power struggle. Esin Kucuktepepinar China Tie Xi Qu (West of the Tracks;
  2002) Wang Bing’s nine-hour epic offers a sweeping perspective on the collapse
  of a vast industrial community in north-east China at the turn of the century.
  The film lays bare the turmoil and disruption of that era: for China, it was a
  pivotal historical moment. Despite its epic nature, West of the Tracks is a
  deeply personal work. In 1999, Wang Bing, alone with a Panasonic EZ1 camera,
  immersed himself in this industrial landscape. Over the next year and a half,
  he roamed the site, accumulating 300 hours of footage that would coalesce into
  this major social and historical work. This was an entirely individual
  initiative, conducted outside China’s film censorship system. And so the film
  has never been integrated into the official narrative of cinematic history.
  Yet its significance was quickly recognised in the west, celebrated not for
  only its scale and story but also its realistic aesthetic. The film confronts
  and reshapes China’s dominant cinematic tradition of ideological film, and
  ushers it on to the global stage. Wang Bing worked under extraordinarily harsh
  conditions. When asked what sustained him, he has said: “I don’t know, truly,
  I don’t know.” Zhang Yaxuan Nigeria Saworoide (Brass Bells; 1999) Tunde Kelani
  is a Nigerian film-maker who can make a legitimate claim to auteur status.
  Active before the Nollywood era kicked off around 1992, Kelani worked as a
  cinematographer before building an impressive oeuvre as a director and
  producer. His films embrace indigenous Yoruba literature and philosophy while
  making scathing sociopolitical commentary. His pièce de résistance has to be
  Saworoide, a political fable about the corruption of absolute power that
  resonates to this day. Released in 1999, the same year that marked Nigeria’s
  return to democratic rule following a brutal military dictatorship,
  Saworoide’s precise and devastating reading of leadership and turmoil in the
  fictional Jogbo community is an obvious allegory for the Nigerian condition. A
  corrupt monarch ascends to the throne and, bolstered by the complicity of
  self-serving lackeys, begins a reign of terror that is matched only by his
  incompetence. He rejects the customary checks and balances on his power and
  soon meets his Waterloo. But as the people find out, things can get even
  worse. Saworoide straddles elements that have come to define Nigerian cinema
  across the decades. Much like the output from Nollywood’s influential home
  video era, Saworoide is dialogue- and plot-heavy. It also contains nods to the
  travelling Yoruba theatre, popular in the 1970s. Kelani’s concise vision keeps
  the film visually dynamic and it plays very well on the big screen. Wilfred
  Okiche Finland Tulitikkutehtaan Tyttö (The Match Factory Girl; 1990) No
  film-maker has done more for the picture of Finnishness than Aki Kaurismäki.
  The minimalist melodrama The Match Factory Girl was the final, best and most
  bleak entry in his Proletariat Trilogy, until he returned in 2023 with the
  lovely Fallen Leaves – a fairytale compared with this one. Iris (Kati Outinen,
  queen of deadpan acting) is a timid factory worker who still lives with her
  mum and stepdad, whom she supports on her meagre earnings. She dreams of
  romance but nobody asks her to dance. Her life is all Finnish gloom: hard
  work, few words, low expectations, loneliness and shame. Every time she tries
  to break out she is crushed, yet she fights back. Miraculously, the film is
  both tragic and darkly funny. Kaurismäki’s visual style is as instantly
  recognisable as Wes Anderson’s, but only he could bring out the beauty in
  these unexceptional settings and his protagonists, who are ordinary workers
  with laconic wit, grit and dignity. They can’t express their feelings in
  gestures or words, but Kaurismäki’s unsparing gaze never abandons them: this
  egalitarian respect for every person’s integrity is very Finnish. As for Iris,
  the smallest of sparrows: her stoic endurance of humiliation and cruelty makes
  one root for murder. Sara Ehnholm Hielm Italy La Grande Guerra (The Great War;
  1959) The Great War speaks to the Italian character after the second world war
  and the end of the fascist regime, and what it still is today. It’s the story
  of two cowards trying to pass themselves off as model soldiers. Their refusal
  to act as soldiers doesn’t come out of a moral or political stance but an
  individual one: why should I risk my life? Let someone else do the job. It’s
  individualism, the Italian way. The film was born out of director Mario
  Monicelli’s spite for the regime’s propaganda, which lionised the myth of
  Italy’s brave and bold heroism during the first world war. Monicelli’s film
  demolishes this story through comedy: it was revolutionary in 1959 and very
  bold. Like everything in Italian cinema from the end of the second world war
  until the early 60s, it was a step in the building of a new identity, and
  comedy is how Italians engage in the most serious affairs. In the film, the
  soldiers – who deceive and bicker with each other – are captured by Austrians
  and face a sudden, moving change of heart. Although they have information that
  might save their lives, they decide to accept their fate and not betray their
  comrades. It’s a decision that both represents and inspires the Italian
  spirit: one of unconditional care for each other that compensates for a lack
  of collective consciousness. Gabriele Niola Iran Bad Ma Ra Khahad Bord (The
  Wind Will Carry Us; 1999) Emerging from a moment shaped by Islamic modernism
  and Ayatollah Khomeini’s criticism of modern media – with its imperialist ways
  of seeing – Abbas Kiarostami’s The Wind Will Carry Us proposes a different way
  of looking. Eleven of the film’s main characters remain off screen, and the
  depths of the Earth – the dark caverns of the village of Siah Darreh – give
  voice to long-shrouded desires. Here, green hay moves as if of its own accord.
  In a rural village, time passes as if yesterday were a month ago, and an old
  villager lives to be 100 or so. As an urban film-maker and his crew wait for
  the elder’s passing so they can film their documentary on local funeral rites,
  a fabulated world appears on screen. Film scholar Christian Keathley once
  wrote that: “Many viewers who watched the first films of the Lumière brothers
  were delighted less by the scenes being staged for their amusement than by the
  fact that, in the background, the leaves were fluttering in the wind.” This
  freedom of the eye to roam, away from the rigid coordinates of western
  commercial cinema, is the hallmark of Iranian cinema after the 1979
  revolution. The Wind Will Carry Us teaches the eye to see differently: to look
  with wonder at things that lie elsewhere, beyond our lived reality. Negar

The Wind Will Carry Us teaches the eye to see differently: to look with wonder at things that lie elsewhere, beyond our lived reality. Negar Mottahedeh
