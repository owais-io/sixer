  As pens and notepads were being laid out for start of the much-touted economic
  roundtable on Monday, the chair of the Productivity Commission, Danielle Wood,
  made a number of dark observations in an address to the National Press Club.
  People in their 30s today, Wood told us, are the first generation to be worse
  off than those born in the previous decade in terms of earnings, housing
  affordability, budget burden and climate impacts. Her comments laid bare how
  important reform of so many aspects of the economy and regulation are if this
  situation is to change. The flipside of the situation facing millennials is
  the largesse that has been laid out for the boomers, such as tax breaks on
  housing and superannuation that benefit those with already substantial
  resources but add to the tax burden of lower-income households who can’t get
  their foot in even one door. Quite obviously, not every boomer in Australia is
  sitting back with multiple investment properties and a multimillion-dollar
  super balance. But boomers were three times more likely to own their own home
  in their 30s than their counterparts today are. Sign up: AU Breaking News

  reasonable adaptation such as the removal of tax exemptions on super balances
  over $3m or phasing out negative gearing. And it’s not just millennials v
  boomers. Before seats had been taken at the roundtable, business and unions
  were firing off at each other over issues such as working from home, work week
  length and AI adoption. Then add to all that the intense bipartisanship we now
  see in politics and it’s a wonder anyone sat down together at all. And this is
  the rub. When it comes to policy decisions, too many are too quick to focus on
  what’s in it for them instead of what is best for society as a whole. So, if
  we make housing more affordable for younger generations, those who are already
  on the housing merry-go-round cry “unfair”. Increased density proposals are
  met with cries of “Not in my back yard!” If we set much-needed strong climate
  targets to contribute to reducing the horror show of unnatural disasters that
  have already become much more frequent, and encouraging investment in green
  industries, then a narrow segment of vested interests (mainly fossil fuel
  polluters) focus only on the jobs that will be lost. They conveniently ignore
  the many more green jobs that will be created, not to mention the vast costs
  from failure to act imposed on individuals, the economy and the budget bottom
  line each time these exacerbated disasters unfold. We cannot deny that some
  policies, even as they contribute to national wellbeing overall, come with a
  cost to specific sectors or regions or even individuals. The go-to book in
  Canberra at the moment is Abundance, written by two American journalists, and
  described by the treasurer as “a ripper”. Much of the book is devoted to the
  costs associated with trying to keep everybody happy, but ultimately only
  delivering increased regulation that leaves us all worse off. And the
  Abundance authors are perhaps right in saying we have moved too far in the
  direction of trying to prevent every possible loss at the expense of
  collective societal gain. (The authors are also silent on the deliberate
  spread of disinformation around supposed harms which also create barriers to
  progress. Think of the nonsense around whales and windfarms). Much like the
  Abundance authors, Wood says: “Ministers should always weigh up the impacts of
  new policies on economic growth and productivity.” This is true, particularly
  when it comes to “regulatory burden”. (As an aside, it’s worth noting that for
  all the hype about “red tape” – and there certainly are complex and
  duplicative processes facing business – Australia rates very highly by
  international standards in terms of regulatory quality. On one measure at
  least, we are second only to Singapore). But I’m not entirely convinced that a
  “growth mindset”, to use another current Canberra buzz phrase, doesn’t risk
  throwing the baby out with the bathwater. If we only look at policy from the
  overarching perspective of growth and productivity, as important as these are,
  then we overlook other important considerations and by doing so add fuel to
  the “us and them” fire. And that makes building a widespread consensus of
  support extremely difficult. The most critical of these considerations is
  distributional impacts. Inevitably, big policy reforms will rarely deliver a
  “win” for everyone. But instead of pretending this is not the case,
  governments should be upfront both around the challenges and how they intend
  to address the impacts on those who may be disproportionately disadvantaged
  and unable to adjust without support. For example, when we introduced a carbon
  price scheme in Australia in 2012, widespread compensation was designed for
  trade-exposed industries and low-income households. When the costly support
  for the domestic car industry was finally removed, state and federal
  governments brought in a raft of programs to support workers and businesses in
  the supply chain. Such solutions may not be perfect but without them we are
  doomed to be stuck in an economy and society that delivers worse results for
  successive generations. Surely, we have had enough of that. The two defining
  crises of Australia today, I believe, are housing affordability and climate
  change. Required policies on both fronts involve trade-offs for some
  individuals, while delivering overall benefits to society. Let’s stop the “us
  and them”, “winners and losers” mentality and focus on planning for solutions
  such as density done well, credible biodiversity management schemes and
  regional economic development. Instead of placing barriers to reforms with a
  narrow, vested-interest mindset, I hope those at the roundtable discussions
  this week will focus on what is best for all of us. And, if it helps, keep the
  situation facing today’s 30-year-olds in sharp focus and let that not be your
  legacy. Nicki Hutley is an independent economist and councillor with the
