  US immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to
  Uganda, after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange
  for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges,
  according to a Saturday court filing. The Costa Rica offer came late on
  Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadorian national would probably be
  released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Ábrego declined to extend
  his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with
  his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified
  his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to
  immigration authorities on Monday. According to official documents posted
  online, the DHS told Ábrego’s attorneys on Friday afternoon that the “DHS may
  remove your client … to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent
  weekends)”. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also directed Ábrego to report
  to its Baltimore office on Monday, according to records posted online. Ábrego
  entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing
  gang violence. He was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against
  deportation to El Salvador. The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal
  immigration officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that
  Ábrego’s deportation was an “administrative error”, officials have repeatedly
  accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his
  family vehemently deny. During his detention at El Salvador’s so-called
  Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and
  psychologically tortured, according to court documents filed by his lawyers in
  July. Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, the Trump administration faced
  widespread pressure to return him to the US, including from a supreme court
  order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return. In June, the
  Trump administration returned Ábrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with
  crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as
  “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January. Before his
  deportation, Ábrego had lived in Maryland for more than a decade, working in
  construction while being married to an American wife. Although Ábrego was
  deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request
  of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to
  immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat
  allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires
  immigration officials to allow Ábrego time to mount a defense. Separately, in
  a statement earlier this week, Uganda said that it agreed to a “temporary
  agreement” with the US to accept some asylum seekers who are deported from the
  country. Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary of Uganda’s foreign
  ministry, said: “The agreement is in respect of third country nationals who
  may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may
  have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.” Waiswa added:
  “This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals
  with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted. Uganda
  also prefers that individuals from African countries shall be the ones
  transferred to Uganda. The two parties are working out the detailed modalities
  on how the agreement shall be implemented.”
