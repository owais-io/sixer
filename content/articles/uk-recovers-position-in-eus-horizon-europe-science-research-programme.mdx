  The UK is quickly recovering a prime position in the EU’s £80bn science
  research programme 18 months after becoming a participating member following
  the resolution of Brexit problems, data shows. The country was frozen out of
  Horizon Europe for three years in a tit-for-tat row with the then prime
  minister, Boris Johnson, over the Northern Ireland trading arrangements. While
  the UK has to play catch-up, entering three years into the seven-year 2020-27
  funding programme, data shows British scientists are punching above their
  weight with €735m (£635m) in grants in 2024. That ranks the UK as the fifth
  most successful country in the programme, which is open to 47 nations: the 27
  EU member states and 20 non-EU associate members also including New Zealand,
  Canada and Norway. Germany, the top participant in Horizon in 2024, won €1.4bn
  (£1.21bn) in grants and Spain, which came second, got €900m (£777m).
  Scientists have said previously they were “over the moon” to be back working
  with EU colleagues. They said they knew it would take time to return to the
  top three because of the time it took to build multinational consortiums to
  apply for funds. But in terms of grants for proposals by individual
  scientists, which are easier to assemble, the UK now ranks as the second-most
  successful participating country after Germany, with €242m (£209m) in funds.
  The UK is the single most successful applicant country when it comes to Marie
  Skłodowska-Curie Actions, one of the most prestigious grant programmes for
  doctoral and post-doctoral research in the world. UK scientists have said
  repeatedly the Brexit lockout damaged Britain’s reputation on the world stage
  and made it difficult for universities to recruit researchers from the EU. In
  terms of recipients, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are neck and
  neck, with awards of over €65m each, followed by University College London and
  Imperial College. With projects ranging from the research to develop brain
  catheters inspired by wasps to efforts to create aviation fuel from yeast and
  greenhouse gases, the UK has been catapulted to the top of the league of
  non-EU beneficiaries by number of grants. Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena, a
  professor in medical robotics at Imperial College London recently completed a
  15-year Horizon-backed research project creating a cranial catheter inspired
  by a conversation he had with the renowned zoologist Julian Vincent about
  wasps’ ability to penetrate hard tree bark to lay eggs. Smaller grantees have
  included individual projects on topics such as textile recycling, conservation
  and robots on farms. The UK was one of the leading beneficiaries of Horizon,
  earning more in grants than it contributed in funds before Brexit. • This
  article was amended on 14 August 2025. An earlier version gave 16 as the
  number of non-EU associate members of the Horizon Europe programme, rather
  than 20. Also Spain was the second ranking participant in terms of grants, not
  the third.
