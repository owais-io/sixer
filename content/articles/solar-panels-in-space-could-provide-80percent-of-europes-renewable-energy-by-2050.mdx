  Solar panels in space could cut Europe’s terrestrial renewable energy needs by
  80% by 2050, a study has found. Using a detailed computer model of the
  continent’s future power grid, the researchers found that a system of
  space-based panels designed by Nasa could reduce the cost of the whole
  European power system by as much as 15%. It could also cut battery use by more
  than two-thirds. The study, led by researchers at King’s College London, is
  the first to assess the possible impact of space solar energy on Europe. The
  space-based solar power (SBSP) panels that yielded the positive results uses a
  heliostat design. The design, which the system imitates, uses mirror-like
  reflectors to collect sunlight in orbit. The sunlight is then transmitted to
  stations on Earth and converted to electricity before it is delivered to an
  energy grid. The computer model of the continent’s power grid spans 33
  countries, and simulates electricity demand, generation and storage to
  identify the lowest-cost option to meet Europe’s electricity needs. When the
  researchers integrated the SBSP concept into the model based on Nasa’s
  predictions of its potential energy capacity, results showed that it could
  replace as much as 80% of Europe’s land-based renewable energy. Land-based
  renewable energy is irregular and weather-dependent, complicating reliable
  supply, and comes at varying costs, the researchers point out. SBSPs could be
  an alternative centralised energy resource that operates above the atmosphere
  with continuous gigawatt-scale power. The authors note that the modelling does
  not account for potential impacts from space-specific challenges such as
  orbital congestion, transmission interruptions or beaming variability, which
  could influence SBSP reliability and operational performance. Nor could the
  potential cost-effectiveness of SBSP be realised until 2050 because building,
  launching and maintaining it would be too expensive unless technological
  growth reduces its costs. Dr Wei He, a senior lecturer at KCL’s engineering
  department and lead author of the study, which is published in Joule, said:
  “There are some risks to consider, such as how the satellite in space could
  have too many solar panels. Could it cause collisions or be damaged by debris
  in space?” Despite those risks, Wei believes the research shows that SBSP has
  the potential to help countries in achieving net zero. “Renewable energy to
  replace fossil fuels is the most important action we are taking as humans.
  Space-based solar power is a potential technology and can provide continuous
  solar power as a renewable energy source,” he said. Japan is already
  developing SBSP and integrating it into its space and net-zero strategy, Wei
  said. Europe could follow suit, the paper suggests, mentioning the continent’s
  longstanding tradition of multinational cooperation of cross-border
  electricity exchange and satellite ventures under the European Space Agency.
  The authors believe Europe could leverage its multinational cooperation to
  develop and operate a centralised SBSP infrastructure. In doing so, it could
  create a continent-scale solution to provide stable, baseload-scale renewable
  supply, reducing the continent’s reliance on gas-fired power. “Now is the
  time,” Wei said.
