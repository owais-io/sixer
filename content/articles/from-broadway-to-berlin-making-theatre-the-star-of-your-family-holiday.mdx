  Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Card (Representative 53.3% APR Variable,
  Annual fee applies, 18+, Subject to status, terms and conditions apply) One of
  the great joys of being a theatre writer is being able to travel and see
  incredible shows across the world. In my time I’ve been lucky enough to see
  musicals on Broadway, dance theatre in Jinan, China, a touring Globe
  production of Hamlet in Sierra Leone, and much more. Theatre is also something
  that I now love to incorporate into family holidays, be that as part of an
  actual vacation or sometimes taking a child along when I have worked abroad.
  Both my children grew up visiting London’s brilliant children’s theatres like
  the Polka in Wimbledon and the Little Angel in Islington. I took my eldest
  along to New York when I had to do an interview out there – it was just before
  he started school in 2019 and it felt like a real adventure just going on the
  flight. We also fitted in a musical in Manhattan and I’m reasonably sure it
  was the highlight of his trip. Andrzej Łukowski’s children grew up visiting
  the Polka Theatre, Wimbledon. Photographs: Amit Lennon/The Guardian If, like
  me, you’re lucky enough to travel regularly, a Marriott Bonvoy American
  Express Card can help you get more out of your trip. Cardmembers receive two
  points per £1 spent on the Card, and an accelerated six points per £1 spent at
  hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy – meaning you can gather points for
  your next stay, whenever that may be. New York, of course, is famed for its
  pioneering theatre productions and the bright lights of Broadway are a
  compelling draw to visitors to the city. And it’s not just something that
  grownups can enjoy. I have found that plenty of the major musicals are family
  friendly, and there are also numerous children’s theatre shows scattered
  across the city including dedicated children’s venues. Stay at the New York
  Marriott Marquis, nestled in the heart of the Broadway district, and you’ll
  have a selection of historic theatres quite literally on your doorstep. Given
  that it’s the city that never sleeps, it’s definitely a plus to have the
  option of Priority Late Checkout (subject to availability) if you’re staying
  with Marriott Bonvoy – just one of a number of great benefits you could be
  eligible for as a Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Cardmember. It’s
  obviously a different experience if you have young children in tow, though it
  may be excited youngsters rather than the city’s famous nightlife that keeps
  you up. Broadway offers productions that are great for kids and grownups
  alike. Photograph: Candy Kempsey/Shutterstock I have also found visits to
  family shows in non-English speaking countries to be accessible and a pretty
  great sort of tourism. You are doing as the locals do, but going to the
  theatre is a familiar experience and the language gap, when it exists, is
  often surprisingly surmountable. Puppetry, physical and street theatre is much
  more popular on the continent than in the UK – puppetry because, historically,
  travelling players took shows all across Europe and needed to have work that
  transcended the language barrier; street theatre because, well, the weather
  tends to be nice. During one holiday we discovered that Berlin has its own
  English language children’s theatre, which has been staging plays for young
  local language learners since the 1980s but is fully accessible to tourists.
  Visiting friends in Sardinia, we caught a marionette show about a tiger’s
  reign of terror by Is Mascareddas, pioneers of puppet theatre on the Italian
  island. My children didn’t understand the words, but were fully invested in
  the tiger’s killing spree. Sheraton Grand Hotel &amp; Spa, Edinburgh means
  being a short stroll away from the Scottish capital’s theatres In fact our
  passion for drama has taken us far and wide, inspiring holidays across Europe
  and beyond. If you travel with a Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card you can
  earn and use your points towards stays at hotels participating in Marriott
  Bonvoy in 144 countries – opening up countless possibilities for your
  theatre-orientated holidays. Stay at the Sheraton Grand Hotel &amp; Spa
  Edinburgh, for example, and you’ll be right in the heart of the city with a
  selection of top venues just a stroll away. The Scottish capital has an
  abundance of theatres and is a great place to see family shows. Things really
  heat up in August, during the city’s enormous festival season, when there are
  dozens and dozens of children’s shows. The JW Marriott Berlin is walking
  distance of several theatres. Photograph: Lutz Vorderwuelbecke Or, if you’re
  visiting the German capital, book the JW Marriott Berlin, located in the
  city’s downtown – within walking distance of several theatres. Check out one
  of the many children’s productions, with several offering selected
  performances with English language subtitles. All that culture can build up an
  appetite, especially among young children tired from sightseeing. Redeem your
  Marriott Bonvoy® points on dining at the hotel, so the whole family can relax
  and feel rejuvenated in comfortable surroundings. Enjoy outdoor productions at
  the Minack theatre, Cornwall (top) or Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, London
  (bottom). Photographs: Juliet Ferguson/Alamy; Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images
  Theatre is a draw all year round, but there’s something quite special about
  the summer holiday season when you can visit an open air theatre. In the UK,
  Cornwall’s stunning coastal Minack theatre is a must-see if you’re in the
  area, a stone amphitheatre in the cliff over the sea, built in the 1930s. Or
  if you’re holidaying in London, head to the gorgeous Regent’s Park Open Air
  theatre, a beautiful setting which offers a lively programme that includes
  family work. So when planning your next family holiday, why not think about a
  night out on the town – at the theatre! How does the Marriott Bonvoy American
  Express Card work? For every £1 you spend on your Card, you’ll receive two
  Marriott Bonvoy® points. If you’re using your Card at a hotel participating in
  Marriott Bonvoy, you’ll receive six points per eligible £1 spent. Points can
  then be redeemed to explore 9,500 properties across more than 30 leading
  brands in 144 countries and territories, and on more than 150 airlines. The
  Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card is also well suited to regular
  travellers. All Cardmembers start with Silver Elite status, and they are
  eligible for a Free Night Award after spending £25,000 in a year. Search for
