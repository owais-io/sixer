  Two police officers have been killed and another wounded at a shooting in the
  Victorian town of Porepunkah, which is home to about 1,000 people. Here’s what
  we know so far: At about 10.30am on Tuesday, about 10 police were attending a
  rural property in the Victorian town of Porepunkah to execute a search warrant
  when they were fired upon. Two officers have been killed and another was
  wounded. According to the chief commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush,
  the two dead officers are still at the scene. A third officer was seriously
  injured and was undergoing surgery at hospital. Ambulance Victoria confirmed
  one person had been transported by air ambulance in a stable condition.
  Wangaratta police said there was still an “active incident” and have urged
  people to avoid the area. Bush said specialist resources had been deployed
  into the area to arrest the person responsible. No arrests have been laid so
  far. In a statement, Victoria police said a “significant search” was under way
  to find the alleged shooter. Police believed the alleged offender had left the
  property and did not know his whereabouts. The area around the town, which is
  about 300km north-east of Melbourne, is very steep and mountainous. Residents
  in the small, tight-knight community have been urged to stay home until the
  operation is concluded. The local council closed all facilities “effective
  immediately” and Porepunkah primary school was in lockdown earlier on Tuesday.
  Principal Jill Gillies said on Tuesday afternoon almost all students had
  returned home, adding it had been “quite an ordeal”. The Porepunkah airfield
  has confirmed it has been closed due to the ongoing emergency response, but
  police and emergency services will still have access. The Victorian premier,
  Jacinta Allan, said the thoughts of “all Victorians” were with the police,
  saying the response showed first responders’ “extraordinary bravery and
  courage”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said his thoughts were with
  the “police for the work they do, each and every day”. He said “the men and
  women who wear the uniform of the police take risks” for everyone. The mayor
  of Alpine Shire, Sarah Nicholas, said in a video message that Tuesday had been
  a day of “deep sorrow and shock” for the community. “We extend our heartfelt
  condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of the two police
  officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our thoughts, love, and unwavering
  support are with you during this incredibly painful time.”
