  When giving advice about protein intake linked to exercise, the performance
  nutritionist Bethan Crouse says: “If you are just a casual gym-goer doing
  resistance training three to four times a week” Is it true that … you should
  eat protein immediately after working out?, 1 September). I was surprised that
  this training was described as casual. I would suggest the other 99.9% of
  non-elite humans would consider this level of commitment regular, dare I say
  even serious. Diego Penagos Surbiton, London • It is clear that Richard Tice
  neither believes in free speech nor understands the Christian gospel, since he
  thinks the archbishop of York should not “interfere with international
  migration policies” (Richard Tice hits back at C of E criticism of Reform
  immigration policy, 31 August). Does he plan to tell Christians the matters on
  which we are now allowed to express opinions? Michael Sanderson Elsecar, South
  Yorkshire • There’s no justification for flying Adam Zampa from Australia to
  deliver 20 balls in the Hundred final at Lord’s (Report, 31 August). What a
  sad indictment of our cricket standing that we have to fly someone halfway
  around the world for such a ridiculous contribution to a major home
  tournament. Andrew Barson Anlaby, East Riding of Yorkshire • We have flown the
  Welsh flag, Y Ddraig Goch, in our back garden for a number of years (Letters,
  31 August). It is a good indicator of which way the wind is blowing. Helen
  Evans Ruthin, Denbighshire • My favourite politicians’ phrase: “lessons will
  be learned” (Letters, 31 August). We’re all still waiting. David Prothero
  Harlington, Bedfordshire • On returning from the V&amp;A, I was surprised to
  read that, according to two scholars, there was no such place as Palestine in
  the early 20th century (Letters, 28 August). This would have come as some
  surprise to my grandfather, who sent beautiful locally crafted gifts and
  postcards to my grandmother in 1918, giving his address as Palestine. He died
  too young and I never met him, but I think he might be horrified at the
  current attempts to eradicate that country, and even its history. Richard
  Ingham London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
