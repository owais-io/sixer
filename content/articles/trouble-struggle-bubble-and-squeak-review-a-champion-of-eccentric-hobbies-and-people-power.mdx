  Trouble, Struggle, Bubble and Squeak review – a champion of eccentric hobbies
  and people power

  Victoria Melody jokes that she joined a historical reenactment society as a
  response to getting divorced. It seems a plausible explanation. Why else would
  someone do something so eccentric? Dressing up in period costume and driving
  to the fields to relive ancient battles is one of those pastimes, like train
  spotting, metal detecting and attending fan conventions, we like to imagine as
  an oddball pursuit. But there is more going on here than a straight
  celebration of everyday British quirkiness. True, Melody has form in this
  area: she became a beauty queen to see what it was like for her pet to be
  entered in a dog show and spent a year living with pigeon fanciers. That is as
  well as the time she trained as a funeral director when she thought her dad
  was dying. As a self-styled anthropologist with a “passion for other people’s
  passions”, she has a genuine love of peculiar hobbies. Her eyes light up when
  she describes the lengths her new friends go to in the name of historical
  accuracy. But in Trouble, Struggle, Bubble and Squeak, she demonstrates an
  interest that goes beyond the whimsical. For this is a story, directed by Mark
  Thomas, less about history buffs dressing up in old costumes and eating
  authentic stew, and more about people resisting authority and taking control
  of their environment. Having muddled up the musketeers of the English civil
  war with her memory of watching Dogtanian, she is fascinated to find a
  conflict between not only royalists and parliamentarians, but also radical
  groupings such as the Levellers, Ranters and, in particular, the Diggers. The
  belief of this dissident group in equality and access to common land strikes a
  chord with Melody as she works as an artist-in-residence on the deprived
  Whitehawk estate in Brighton. What if the land variously threatened by
  developers and neglected by the council could be reclaimed by those who lived
  there? What if it could be achieved through a massive – if not exactly
  accurate – historical reenactment? Her retelling of the tale, wide-eyed and
  ever delighted, is a joyful testament to people power and a heartening parable
  about the possibility of collective action. • At Pleasance Courtyard,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
