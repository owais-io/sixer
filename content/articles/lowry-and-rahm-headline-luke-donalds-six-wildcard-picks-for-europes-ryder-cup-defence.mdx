  Cup defence

  Europe will defend the Ryder Cup later this month with 11 of the 12 players
  who saw off the United States in Rome two years ago after Luke Donald
  unsurprisingly opted for experience with his wildcard picks. Europe’s captain
  has turned to Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Victor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg, Jon Rahm
  and Matt Fitzpatrick to complete his team for Bethpage. Donald confirmed his
  choices on Monday, five days after his US counterpart Keegan Bradley had done
  likewise. Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood,
  Tyrrell Hatton and Rasmus Højgaard had already automatically qualified for the
  European side. In what is a quirk, Højgaard is the sole change from Rome where
  his twin brother, Nicolai, turned out in European colours. Those to narrowly
  miss out include Matt Wallace, who was reduced to tears at the end of the DP
  World Tour’s stop in Switzerland on Sunday upon realisation his Ryder Cup
  dream was over once again. Cases were also made at various points in the
  qualifying process for Marco Penge, Thomas Detry, Harry Hall and Aaron Rai but
  it always felt likely Donald would opt for consistency. Europe have not won or
  retained a Ryder Cup on US soil since 2012. More details to follow
