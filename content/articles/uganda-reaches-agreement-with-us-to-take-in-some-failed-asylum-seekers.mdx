  Uganda has reached an agreement with the US to take in deportees from third
  countries who may not get asylum but are “reluctant” to go back to their own
  countries, according to Uganda’s foreign ministry. The country will not accept
  people with criminal records or unaccompanied minors under the temporary
  arrangement, the Ugandan foreign ministry’s permanent secretary said in a
  statement. He did not say whether Uganda was receiving any payment or other
  benefits and how many deportees it would accept. “Uganda also prefers that
  individuals from African countries shall be the ones transferred to Uganda.
  The two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement
  shall be implemented,” Bagiire Vincent Waiswa said. The government of the east
  African country is the latest to strike a deal with the US, which is seeking
  to expel millions of undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and foreigners with
  criminal convictions or more minor legal infractions on their record. In July,
  five migrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba, who Washington said
  had been convicted of serious crimes, were flown to Eswatini, where they are
  now in a high security prison. The deportations are being challenged by a
  group of Swazi and southern African NGOs, with a high court hearing scheduled
  for Friday. Also in July, eight men from various countries were deported by
  the US to South Sudan, via Djibouti, where they were held for weeks in a
  shipping container. Meanwhile, more than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated to
  Venezuela after being sent to a notorious El Salvador prison in March without
  due process. Meanwhile, Rwanda has said it will take in 250 people deported by
  the US. The Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC they
  would be given “workforce training, health care and accommodation to jump
  start their lives in Rwanda”. Uganda is a US ally and has been ruled by the
  80-year-old president, Yoweri Museveni, for almost 40 years. His political
  opponents are regularly sent to jail. On Wednesday, a Ugandan official denied
  that it had reached a deal with the US, saying that they did not have the
  facilities and infrastructure to accommodate immigrants. The denial followed a
  CBS News story on Tuesday that cited internal government documents, reporting
  that the White House had reached deportation deals with Honduras and Uganda.
  Godwin Toko, the deputy executive director of Agora, a Ugandan thinktank that
  promotes democracy and human rights said: “Uganda doesn’t have the cards,
  economically … in terms of military power or in any other sense. But Uganda
  can then play a good boy for the US and this is one of the avenues that the
  Ugandan government uses to gain leverage.” Uganda has a record of accepting
  migrants and asylum seekers deported by other countries. Between 2015 and
  2018, Israel sent about 1,700 Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers to the
  country. Uganda hosts nearly 2 million refugees and asylum seekers, most from
  other east African countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo,
  Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan. However, while Uganda’s government and citizens
  are known for being welcoming to foreigners, Toko said that it has a bad track
  record of protecting people who have fled for political reasons. He said: “God
  forbid that among the people being brought to Uganda there is a Kenyan
  dissident. I think Uganda will have no problem whatsoever handing that
  dissident over to the Kenyan government the next day. Or a South Sudanese
  dissident or any country that has a good relationship with Uganda.”
