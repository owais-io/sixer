  The $90m fine imposed on Qantas for illegally sacking 1,820 workers in 2020
  during the start of the pandemic represents one of the largest corporate
  penalties an Australian court has ever imposed for a non-financial offence. It
  follows a $100m penalty imposed on Qantas by the Australian Competition and
  Consumer Commission for selling tickets on flights it had already decided to
  cancel, and the forced creation of a $120m compensation fund for the workers.
  Much larger penalties have been paid by banks and casinos, mostly for
  money-laundering offences, most notably a $1.3bn fine paid by Westpac. But
  those appeared to be regarded as costs of doing business, at least when that
  business involves handling large sums of money and dealing with people who
  want to move it quickly. Until recently, non-financial corporations could, and
  did, take the same attitude. Offences such as wage theft attracted derisory
  penalties, if they were prosecuted at all. Even negligence leading to
  workplace deaths and injuries rarely involved substantial fines. Qantas
  benefited an estimated $100m a year from outsourcing its baggage handling,
  though this may have been overoptimistic. Based on past precedent, Qantas
  managers would have assessed that any penalty could easily be recouped by cost
  savings. But with penalties of over $200m, as well as very substantial legal
  costs, it will take years before the airline comes out ahead. It would
  certainly have been better to engage in good-faith negotiations. All these
  developments followed decades of labour market reforms (a term meaning
  “change” which almost invariably refers to change for the worse). Nearly all
  of these reforms strengthened the position of employers and weakened that of
  workers. In particular, the enterprise bargaining system introduced under the
  Hawke-Keating government made strikes presumptively illegal, outside the
  limits of “protected industrial action”. The enterprise bargaining framework
  made it easy for corporations to replace their existing employees with
  lower-paid workers from labour hire agencies, or to outsource work altogether.
  Concerns about reputational damage used to play an important role in
  discouraging bad corporate behaviour. But Qantas’ 2011 lockout, highly
  successful in boosting profits, was seen as a lesson by many other employers.
  It took another decade before the ruthless profiteering of the Alan Joyce era
  began to erode the idea that the beloved “flying kangaroo” deserved the role
  of a national flag carrier, even though it had been privatised in the 1990s.
  Pushback from workers has been slow, but it has begun to have an effect. In
  contrast to its glacial pace on most policy issues, the Albanese government
  has been active in protecting workers’ rights. Deliberate wage theft has
  finally been criminalised at a national level from 1 January this year. The
  labour hire loophole has also been addressed, along with attacks on penalty
  rates. But the fundamental problems of enterprise bargaining remain. As Shae
  McCrystal of the University of Sydney has observed, the solution to the
  outsourcing problem lies in multi-employer and industry-level bargaining. It
  shouldn’t be significantly cheaper to outsource your workers. If all employers
  within a sector have to pay the same rates through multi-employer or
  industry-level agreements, the incentive to outsource falls away. But
  employers are pushing back against this. In the lead-up to this week’s
  economic roundtable, there have been plenty of pronouncements about the need
  for deregulation and the removal of unspecified “red tape” which is said to be
  “strangling growth”. Despite this, it seems the tide has turned in favour of
  workers. Work from home has changed the culture of office work, much to the
  dismay of CEOs, with clear net benefits for the economy as a whole arising
  from reduced commuting and better work-life balance. The push for shorter
  standard working hours, abandoned after the failure of the 35-hour week
  campaign in the 1980s, is back on the agenda. There is much to be done to
  restore a fair balance of power in the workplace. The hefty penalty imposed on
  Qantas is one small step in that direction. John Quiggin is a professor at the
  University of Queensland’s School of Economics
