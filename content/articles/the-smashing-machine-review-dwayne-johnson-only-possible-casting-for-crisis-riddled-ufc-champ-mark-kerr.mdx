  Benny Safdie has written and directed a solid bro drama for the UFC fanbase
  and maybe a little way beyond. It is about the central crisis in the life of
  man-mountain Mark Kerr, America’s pioneering MMA and ultimate fighting champ,
  who in 1997 found himself in the ring, or maybe the cage, with his demons
  after the unthinkable humiliation of losing for the first time. This feature
  is in fact developed from a 2002 documentary about Kerr with the same title.
  He confronted his substance abuse, relationship anxieties and the question of
  what the heck life is for if you can’t simply win all the time. Kerr is played
  by Dwayne Johnson, a colossus of muscle topped off with a head the size of
  Indiana Jones’s boulder, a body on which the only visible fat is rippling at
  the nape of his neck. Johnson’s appearance is modified by close-cut frizzy
  hair and facial prosthetics that make him look like Jon Favreau playing the
  Hulk. No other casting was remotely possible – not unless Timothée Chalamet
  fancied bulking up. (Sacha Baron Cohen could do it these days, and would
  probably want to play it every bit as seriously and non-satirically as
  Johnson.) The terrible, existential nightmare of losing – a possibility for
  which no one in Kerr’s professional or personal circle appeared to have
  prepared him – causes that giant statue of a man to wobble and topple. Kerr
  has to throw his opioids in the trash, enter rehab and deal again with the
  important people in his life; one of them is his best buddy, sometime coach
  and fighting rival Mark Coleman, slightly woodenly played here by Ryan Bader,
  an actual MMA fighter with no acting experience who doesn’t look as exotically
  jacked as Kerr. In those early days of MMA, the championship took place in
  Japan and it was called Pride; those hugely built male specimens would snarl,
  grapple and tussle under this title, and a cheekier, less brand-respectful
  film might have tried a gag here, or wondered if there were emotional aspects
  of the sport which had been left unexplored. The other person in Mark’s life,
  however, is his girlfriend Dawn, played with sympathy and wit by Emily Blunt,
  who has to cower and flinch as Mark, in a towering rage, will occasionally put
  his fist through the kitchen door. Immediately after the loss, Kerr has a
  breakdown which causes him to collapse; upon regaining consciousness, he
  remembers the medic testing him by asking him who the president is – he
  answers “Ronald Reagan”, a moment of droll political significance that Safdie
  doesn’t stress. Johnson’s testy and petulant post-rehab scenes with Blunt are
  shrewdly insightful; he scolds her for not pruning his giant cactus properly
  and not getting the leaves out of the pool. Dawn realises that when her
  husband was drinking and the permanent throb of pain dulled with opioids, he
  was a sweet, loving boyfriend. Has sobriety revealed a nasty mean-minded guy
  who is always snitching on her to his AA sponsor? And is Dawn actually less
  important to Mark than his pal Coleman, whom he might have to fight for the
  world championship? It’s difficult to tell. The film does not really permit
  the various emotional crises and issues to supersede the importance of
  fighting all that much, and the fighting itself is not transformed or
  transfigured in the drama. Even the climax of the great Kerr-Coleman face-off
  doesn’t make it entirely clear if Kerr has in some sense chosen his girlfriend
  over his friend and his sport. The movie doesn’t reach for tragedy or extreme
  dysfunction, like Sean Durkin’s The Iron Claw from 2023 or Bennett Miller’s
  Foxcatcher from a decade earlier, nor does Safdie go for big set pieces, like
  a boxing movie might, with eve-of-battle scenes in the dressing room. However,
  there is one bravura moment when Kerr, in shock after his loss, walks through
  the corridors, politely complains to the sponsor about his opponent breaking
  the rules; still sweaty and in his trunks, he then goes down one floor in the
  elevator causing a member of the venue’s restaurant staff carrying bread to
  think twice about getting in with him … and then Kerr bursts into tears in his
  dressing room. These moments of vulnerability are touching, though I wished
  the film could have promoted the excellent Blunt to equal status in the drama.
  • The Smashing Machine screened at the Venice film festival.
