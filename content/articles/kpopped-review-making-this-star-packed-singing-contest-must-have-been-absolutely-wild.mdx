  KPOPPED review – making this star-packed singing contest must have been
  absolutely wild

  Megan Thee Stallion. Patti LaBelle. Kylie Minogue. Two-fifths of the Spice
  Girls. These are just a smattering of the multiplatinum sellers in the
  all-singing, all-dancing trailer for KPOPPED, which, honestly, looked epic. If
  I had been reviewing this new Lionel Richie-produced singing contest based on
  those 109 seconds alone – complete with roaring stage pyrotechnics and Megan
  performing a K-pop version of her smash hit Savage – it would have been an
  easy five stars. Sadly, the series that follows isn’t quite as irresistible.
  Each of the eight episodes sticks tightly to the same format: an established
  Korean boy or girlband is split in two, with each half paired with a different
  “western” solo artist to reimagine one of the guest’s hits. They then perform
  said cover together, along with military-precision dance moves. At the end of
  each episode, a studio audience decides which song was “kpopped” the most
  effectively (exact metrics aren’t provided, but it essentially boils down to
  “which is the most up-tempo, and maybe a little menacing to boot”). Where
  bands like Boyz II Men are involved, the show forgoes having two guest
  artists, and each group just performs twice (once with each half of the Korean
  outfit), effectively competing against itself. I know, I know, it doesn’t make
  sense. Take that up with Apple. So the star power is high but the action
  forced and formulaic. There is usually some kind of acknowledgment from the
  guest stars that K-pop is “the in thing”, something their children or
  grandchildren know more about than them, while the Korean contingent talk
  vaguely about how iconic the guests are. There are low-stakes cultural
  exchanges, such as Megan eating unbearably spicy ramen; Kylie Minogue learning
  a traditional Korean dance; and Emma Bunton and Mel B attending a tea
  ceremony. Two artist-approved covers are then magicked up, with lyrics and
  dance moves mastered in a mere 48 hours. Then it’s on to the live performances
  in front of starstruck audiences, who would surely listen to the likes of ITZY
  and Ateez belting out the phone book. Gangnam Style star Psy, billed as a
  co-host, is actually confined to prerecorded cameo appearances; it is the
  indefatigable Soojeong Son, a Korean-American actor, who comperes on stage.
  The result is harmless but also largely vibeless, and a fairly blatant attempt
  to cash in on the ubiquity of K-pop. I’m not suggesting that we go back to the
  bad old days of Simon Cowell crushing the hopes and dreams of terrified
  normies on primetime TV. But KPOPPED shows that singing contests need
  friction, drama and maybe the occasional botched high note. Here, everything
  feels frictionless, even though the logistics must have been wild (“Did you
  make Patti LaBelle do this?” asks Tell It to My Heart singer Taylor Dayne, as
  she cooks snails). Unless you’re already a K-pop connoisseur, you’re unlikely
  to learn much here, except that the people involved work very, very hard,
  Korean girlbands are liable to give you body dysmorphia, and Korean boybands
  have the most impressively rigid curtain haircuts known to man. Megan – who
  does the odd bit of hosting here, too – describes K-pop as being “like boot
  camp”. Besides Jess Glynne describing it as a “system”, this is the nearest we
  get to any acknowledgment of just how regimented their counterparts’ pop
  careers are. (Maybe that’s not surprising, considering that Korean
  entertainment powerhouse CJ ENM co-produced the series). The best moments,
  then, are the ones that are a little chaotic. Boy George attempting to sing in
  Korean. TLC’s T-Boz struggling to keep up with a high-energy dance break. Mel
  B deciding that synchronised choreo isn’t for her and just doing her own
  thing. Vanilla Ice amending the dance moves for Ice Ice Baby back to his
  original 1990 routine, leaving the members of Kep1er (pronounced kepler) in a
  tizz. And yet, these issues are quickly resolved, and performances go off
  without a hitch. Karma Chameleon in translation is even – shockingly – pretty
  decent. The final episode is a revelation, but not in a way that has anything
  to do with K-pop. Boyz II Men – it turns out – sound as excellent as they did
  30 years ago, and their version of End of the Road with Blackswan singer Nvee
  (who is herself American) is truly a delight. It does sound suspiciously like
  the original, though. Not so much “kpopped”, then, as simply made in Korea. •
