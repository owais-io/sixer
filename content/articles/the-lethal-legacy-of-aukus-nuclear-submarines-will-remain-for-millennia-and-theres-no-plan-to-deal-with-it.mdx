  In the cold deep waters of Rosyth Harbour lie the dormant hulks of Britain’s
  decommissioned nuclear submarines. One of the shells lashed to the dock here
  is HMS Dreadnought, Britain’s first nuclear-powered submarine. It was
  commissioned in 1963, retired in 1980, and has spent decades longer tied to a
  harbour than it ever did in service. The spent nuclear fuel removed from its
  reactor remains in temporary storage. For decades the UK has sought a solution
  to the nuclear waste its fleet of submarines generates. After decades of
  fruitless search there are “ongoing discussions” but still no place for
  radioactive waste to be permanently stored. Similarly, in the US – the naval
  superpower which controls a vast landmass and which has run nuclear submarines
  since the 1950s – there is still no permanent storage for its submarines’
  nuclear waste. More than a hundred decommissioned radioactive reactors sit in
  an open-air pit in Washington state, on a former plutonium production site the
  state’s government describes as “one of the most contaminated nuclear sites in
  the world”. This is what becomes of nuclear-powered submarines at the end of
  their comparatively short life. A nuclear-powered submarine can expect a
  working life of three decades: the spent fuel of a submarine powered by highly
  enriched uranium can remain dangerously radioactive for millennia. Finland is
  building an underground waste repository to be sealed for 100,000 years. For
  Australia’s proposed nuclear-powered submarine fleet there is, at present,
  nowhere for that radioactive spent fuel to go. As a non-nuclear country – and
  a party to the non-proliferation treaty – Australia has no history of, and no
  capacity for, managing high-level nuclear waste. But Australia is not alone:
  there is no operational site anywhere on Earth for the permanent storage of
  high-level nuclear waste. ‘Australia shall be responsible … ’ Documents
  released under freedom of information laws show that, beginning in the 2050s,
  each of Australia’s decommissioned Aukus submarines will generate both
  intermediate- and high-level radioactive waste: a reactor compartment and
  components “roughly the size of a four-wheel drive”; and spent nuclear fuel
  “roughly the size of a small hatchback”. The Australian Submarine Agency says
  the exact amount of high-level waste Australia will be responsible for is
  “classified”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Because Australia’s submarines
  will run on highly enriched uranium (as opposed to low enriched uranium –
  which can power a submarine but cannot be used in a warhead) the waste left
  behind is not only toxic for millennia, it is a significant proliferation
  risk: highly enriched uranium can be used to make weapons. The eight
  nuclear-powered submarines proposed for Australia’s navy will require roughly
  four tonnes of highly enriched uranium to fuel their sealed reactor units:
  enough for about 160 nuclear warheads on some estimates. The spent fuel will
  require military-grade security to safeguard it. The problems raised by
  Australia’s critics of Aukus are legion: the agreement’s $368bn cost; the
  lopsided nature of the pact in favour of the US; sclerotic rates of
  shipbuilding in the US and the UK, raising concerns that Australia’s nuclear
  submarines might never arrive; the loss of Australian sovereignty over those
  boats if they do arrive; the potential obsolescence of submarine warfare; and
  whether Aukus could make Australia a target in an Indo-Pacific conflict. All
  are grave concerns for a middle power whose security is now more tightly bound
  by Aukus to an increasingly unreliable “great and powerful friend”. But the
  most intractable concern is what will happen to the nuclear waste. It is a
  problem that will outlive the concept of Australia as a nation-state, that
  will extend millennia beyond the comprehension of anybody reading these words,
  that will still be a problem when Australia no longer exists. And it cannot be
  exported. The Aukus agreement expressly states that dealing with the
  submarines’ nuclear waste is solely Australia’s responsibility. “Australia
  shall be responsible for the management, disposition, storage, and disposal of
  any spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste … including radioactive waste
  generated through submarine operations, maintenance, decommissioning, and
  disposal,” Article IV, subclause D of the treaty states. As well, should
  anything go wrong, at any point, with Australia’s nuclear submarines, the risk
  is all on Australia. “Australia shall indemnify … the United States and the
  United Kingdom against any liability, loss, costs, damage or injury …
  resulting from Nuclear Risks connected with the design, manufacture, assembly,
  transfer, or utilization of any Material or Equipment, including Naval Nuclear
  Propulsion Plants,” subclause E states. “‘Nuclear Risks’,” the treaty states,
  “means those risks attributable to the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other
  hazardous properties of material.” ‘Decide and defend’ An emeritus professor
  at Griffith University’s school of environment and science, Ian Lowe, tells
  Guardian Australia that the government’s regime for storing low-level nuclear
  waste is a “shambles”. He says the government’s “decide and defend” model for
  choosing a permanent waste storage site has consistently failed. “You
  currently have radioactive waste from Lucas Heights, from Fishermans Bend, and
  from nuclear medicine and research all around Australia, just stored in
  cupboards and filing cabinets and temporary sheds,” Lowe says. “The
  commonwealth government has made three attempts to establish a national
  facility – it’s a repository if you’re in favour of it, it’s a waste dump if
  you’re opposed – and on every occasion there’s been local opposition,
  particularly opposition from Indigenous landowners, and on each of those three
  occasions … the proposal has collapsed.” Most of Australia’s low-level and
  intermediate nuclear waste – much of it short-lived medical waste – is stored
  at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation facility in
  Lucas Heights in outer Sydney. Lowe says the nuclear safety regulator,
  ARPANSA, does a commendable job in protecting the public but the facility was
  never intended to be permanent. Australia has been searching for a permanent
  site for nuclear waste for nearly three decades. Its approach – derided by
  Lowe as “decide and defend”: where government chooses a place to put
  radioactive waste and then defends the decision against community opposition –
  has failed in Woomera, in central South Australia, in the late 1990s, then
  Muckaty station in the Northern Territory, then on farmland near Kimba, again
  in SA. The federal court ruled against the Kimba plan in 2023, after a
  challenge from the traditional owners, the Barngarla people, who had been
  excluded from consultation. Lowe, the author of Long Half-Life: The Nuclear
  Industry in Australia, says the complexities and risks of storing high-level
  nuclear waste from a submarine are factors greater than the low- and
  intermediate-level waste Australia now manages. “The waste from nuclear
  submarines is much nastier and much more intractable,” he says. “And because
  they use weapons-grade highly enriched uranium there is the greater security
  issue of needing to make sure that not only do you need to protect against
  that waste irradiating people and the environment, you must also ensure that
  malevolent actors, who have in mind a malicious use of highly enriched
  uranium, can’t get their hands on it.” Australia’s decision to use highly
  enriched uranium to power its submarines, as opposed to low enriched uranium
  (reactors would need refuelling each decade), is a “classic case of kicking
  the can down the road and creating a problem for future generations”, Lowe
  argues. “In the short term, it’s better to have highly enriched uranium and a
  sealed reactor that you never need to maintain during the life of the
  submarine. But at the end of the life of the submarine, you have a much more
  serious problem.” The high-level nuclear waste from Australia’s submarines
  will be hazardous for “hundreds of thousands of years,” Lowe says. “There are
  arguments about whether it’s 300,000 or 500,000 or 700,000 years, but we’re
  talking a period at least as long as humans have existed as an identifiably
  separate species. The time horizon for political decision makers is typically
  four or five years: the time horizon of what we’re talking about is four or
  five hundred thousand years, so there’s an obvious disconnect.” Inside ‘Trench
  94’ The US and the UK have run nuclear-powered (and nuclear-armed) submarines
  for decades. In the UK, 23 nuclear submarines have been decommissioned, none
  have been dismantled, 10 remained nuclear-fuelled. Most are sitting in water
  in docks in Scotland and on England’s south-west coast. The first submarine to
  be disposed of – the cold war-era HMS Swiftsure was retired from service in
  1992 – will be finally dismantled in 2026. Keeping decommissioned nuclear subs
  afloat and secure costs the UK upwards of £30m a year. There is still no site
  for permanent storage of their radioactive waste: there has been “progress and
  ongoing discussions”, the defence minister, Lord Coaker, told the House of
  Lords last year, but still no site. The UK has about 700,000 cubic metres of
  toxic waste, roughly the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses. Much of it is
  stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, a site described by the Office for Nuclear
  Regulation says as “one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the
  world”. In the US, contaminated reactors from more than 100 retired submarines
  are stored in “Trench 94” – a massive open pit at the Hanford nuclear site in
  Washington state. Spent nuclear fuel is also sent to the Idaho National
  Laboratory and sites in South Carolina and Colorado. Hanford is designed to
  last 300 years but the site has a chequered history of pollution and radiation
  leaks. Washington state describes it as “one of the most contaminated nuclear
  sites in the world”. Finland is the first country to devise a permanent
  solution. It is building an underground facility 450 metres below ground,
  buried in the bedrock of the island of Olkiluoto. The Onkalo – Finnish for
  cave or cavity – facility has taken more than 40 years to build (the site was
  chosen by government in 1983) and has cost €1bn. It is now undergoing trials.
  ‘A Trojan horse’ In March 2023 Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles,
  said high-level nuclear waste would be stored on “defence land, current or
  future”, raising the prospect that a site could be identified and then
  declared “defence land”. A process for establishing a site would be publicly
  revealed “within 12 months”, he said. That process has not been announced nor
  a site identified. Australia will require a site for high-level nuclear waste
  from the “early 2050s”, according to the Australian Submarine Agency. Senate
  estimates heard last year that there have been no costings committed for the
  storage of spent fuel. And preparing a site for storing high-level radioactive
  waste for millennia will take decades. Guardian Australia sent a series of
  questions to Marles’ office about the delayed process for selecting a site. A
  spokesperson for the Australian Submarine Agency responded, saying: “The
  government is committed to the highest levels of nuclear stewardship,
  including the safe and secure disposal of waste. “As the Government has said,
  the disposal of high-level radioactive waste won’t be required until the
  2050s, when Australia’s first nuclear-powered submarine is expected to be
  decommissioned.” The spokesperson confirmed that Australia would be
  responsible for all of the spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste generated
  from the Aukus submarines: it would not have responsibility for intermediate-
  or high-level radioactive waste – including spent fuel – from the US, UK or
  any other country. No permanent storage site had been identified for low-level
  radioactive waste, which would include waste from foreign submarines. The
  government has consistently said it will engage extensively with industry,
  nuclear experts and affected communities to build a social licence for a
  permanent storage site. But Dave Sweeney of the Australian Conservation
  Foundation says he has seen little evidence of genuine effort to build social
  licence. The leaders who signed the Aukus deal – and those who continue to
  support it – have failed to comprehend the consequences beyond their political
  careers, he says. “None of the leaders who announced Aukus are in power any
  more,” he tells the Guardian. “One hundred thousand years from now, who knows
  what the world looks like, but Australia, whatever is here then, will still be
  dealing with the consequences of that high-level waste.” Sweeney says the
  “opacity” of the decision-making around the Aukus agreement itself is
  compounded by fears that the deal could be only the beginning of a nuclear
  industry expansion in Australia. “We see this as a Trojan horse to expanding,
  facilitating, empowering the nuclear industry, emboldening the nuclear
  industry everywhere,” he says. “It is creepy, controversial, costly,
  contaminating, and leading to vastly decreased security and options for
  regional and global peace.” Beyond the astronomical cost of the submarine
  deal, its the true burden would be borne by innumerable future generations.
  “We are talking thousands and thousands of years: it is an invisible pervasive
  pollutant and contaminant and the only thing that gets rid of it is time. And
  with the whole Aukus deal, that’s what we’re running out of.”
