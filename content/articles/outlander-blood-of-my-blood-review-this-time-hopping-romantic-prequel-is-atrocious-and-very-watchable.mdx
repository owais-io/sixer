  Scotland, 1714, and the air is heavy with script. Scowling laird Red Jacob
  MacKenzie (Peter Mullan) has snuffed it and the task of spelling out the
  significance of the tragedy has fallen, from no little height, on his eldest
  daughter. “Clan MacKenzie is vulnerable,” wails Ellen MacKenzie (Harriet
  Slater). “No successor has been named. Someone else, not of our blood, could
  come in and take charge of the clan; of our home, of our money, of our
  reputation, of everything we have!” Agreement comes from the shadows, where a
  maid is hiding from the soundtrack’s bagpipes. “Your father’s untimely death
  has shaken us all, lass,” she whispers, tremulously. “What’s to come will be a
  trial …” [a pause, here, to allow for the arrival of the requisite italics] “…
  for all of us.” She’s not wrong. Or rather, she’s nae wrang. For this is
  Outlander: Blood of My Blood, where the accents are as thick as the exposition
  and everyone is forced to stand in driving rain as slabs of dialogue are
  dragged by wincing Scotsmen across glens the colour of porridge. It’s quite
  something. But then, so was – and, indeed is – Outlander, the unapologetically
  preposterous time-travelling romantic drama for which this unapologetically
  preposterous time-travelling romantic drama serves as a prequel. Outlander,
  for the unaccustomed, goes something like this: spirited second world war
  nurse Claire Randall (Caitríona Balfe) touches a standing stone while
  holidaying in the Scottish Highlands and is immediately transported back to
  1743, where she falls in love with brooding soldier Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan)
  and his hexagonal jawline. There follows much “love across the divide”
  melodrama, plus Jacobite-based skirmishes, VisitScotland-approved zoom-shots
  of cattle and soft-focus heritage buttocks. With the eighth (eighth!) and
  final series due to air next year, the decision has been made to expand the
  Outlander universe, lest the loss of muscular actors staggering between eras
  with their kilts around their ankles proves too much to bear. And now? The fun
  continues with Outlander: Blood of My Blood, in which we meet the parents of
  both Jamie and Claire as they, too, #livelaughlove between past and present.
  Hang on a minute, though. Didn’t Outlander make it clear that Claire’s parents
  died in a car crash when she was a young child? It certainly did! And was
  there any mention of them having been involved in any type of time-travellery
  prior to this? There certainly was not! But never mind that because they’re
  alive now, banging on a first world war-era picnic blanket before
  conspicuously not dying in the aforementioned car crash. Instead, Julia
  Moriston (Hermione Corfield) and Henry Beauchamp (Jeremy Irvine) skip merrily
  from the CGI wreckage before Julia promptly disappears into the same
  standing-stone time-portal that will, 30 years hence, whoosh-off her daughter.
  The end. Of episode one, at least. There’ll be more from the bangers as the
  series progresses. Or rather, as the series continues (“progresses” seems too
  strong a word for a production that contains the line, “My, my, a sassenach –
  and a fiery one!”). For now, however, we are primarily concerned with Clan
  MacKenzie. “There are plenty of folk eager to see the demise ae Clan
  MacKenzie!” warns adviser Ned Gowan (Conor MacNeill). “I will bring glory tae
  Clan MacKenzie!” bellows Dougal MacKenzie (Sam Retford) directing the
  full-force of his 18th-century action-beard at shifty brother Colum (Séamus
  McLean Ross). Dougal is a Bad Lot. We know this because he shouts at boars and
  boffs a topless local over a barrel. Older sister Ellen, meanwhile, has just
  met Brian Fraser, bastard son of Simon Fraser, formerly Lord Lovat of Beaufort
  (“I’m Brian Fraser, bastard son of Simon Fraser, formerly Lord Lovat of
  Beaufort”). Stunned by Brian’s (Jamie Roy) tousled bob, she agrees to secretly
  meet him on a local bridge. Will their forbidden love eventually lead to the
  birth of Outlander’s Jamie Fraser while widening the age-old rift between Clan
  MacKenzie and Clan Fraser? Aye. The good bits, then: the (only partly
  Scottish) cast’s accents, all of which are, to these Scottish ears, flawless.
  Similarly not-bad is the cinematography (spectacular) and the acting, which is
  uniformly decent. But the script. Oh, the script. There is the line, “They say
  hatred and love are two sides of the same coin.” Someone else says, “Rest
  assured, this incident will not be forgotten easily, Dougal MacKenzie!” before
  ducking for cover as another girder of exposition crashes from the rafters. It
  is both atrocious and very watchable. But is it as atrocious and very
  watchable as Outlander? For now, the jury is oot. • Outlander: Blood of My
  Blood is on MGM+ on Prime Video now
