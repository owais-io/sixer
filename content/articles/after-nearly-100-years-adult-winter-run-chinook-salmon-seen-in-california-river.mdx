  Adult winter-run Chinook salmon have been spotted in northern California’s
  McCloud River for the first time in nearly a century, according to the
  California department of fish and wildlife (CDFW). The salmon were confirmed
  to be seen near Ash Camp, tucked deep in the mountains of northern California
  where Hawkins creek flows into the McCloud River. A video posted by CDFW and
  taken by the Pacific states marine fisheries commission shows a female Chinook
  salmon guarding her nest of eggs on the river floor. Winter-run Chinook salmon
  is considered an endangered species by Noaa, and is marked by the organization
  as “one of just nine species considered to be most at risk of extinction in
  the near-term”. The Winnemem Wintu Tribe has long fought the enlargement of
  the Shasta dam, which has hindered salmon hatching by warming water
  temperatures above the chilly range that salmon prefer to lay their eggs in.
  The introduction of hatchery-raised, winter-run salmon “delays extinction”,
  according to Rebekah Olstad, salmon restoration project manager for the
  Winnemem Wintu Tribe, with understanding a longer road lies ahead, one that
  hinges on full restoration of self-sufficient wild salmon. “The salmon that
  exist right now, they don’t know how to mountain climb, they don’t know how to
  go up waterfalls because they’re blocked,” Olstad said. “So it’s generations
  and generations of eggs and salmon who don’t have those genes anymore to be
  wild.” Olstad is working to help the Winnemem Wintu achieve two further goals.
  Constructing a volitional passage for the salmon, meaning allowing a way for
  the salmon to spawn and complete a full life cycle from ocean to stream, is
  crucial for eco-systemic restoration, given salmon’s status as a keystone
  species. “Salmon are in the McLeod River, and that’s a good thing. But there’s
  no way it’s for them to get out back to the ocean,” Michael Preston, a
  Winnemem Wintu tribal member, said. “That’s the real salmon, right? They have
  to go to the ocean to come back.” Wild salmon from the McCloud River were long
  thought by the Winnemem Wintu to be extinct. But international coverage of a
  Winnemem war dance protest against the Shasta dam in 2004 led to the discovery
  of McCloud River salmon in an unexpected place – the mountainous rivers of New
  Zealand. Chinook salmon were exported around the world by the Baird hatchery
  in the early 1900s, where some from the McCloud River took hold in New
  Zealand. The Winnemem Wintu are working with Noaa and the CDFW to bring the
  fish, and their wild genetics, back to their homeland. Salmon restoration is
  not unique to the Winnemem Wintu or their ancestral lands, but to the land
  across the western US and Canada that the fish historically swam. For the
  Winnemem Wintu, and other tribal nations, salmon are part of their cosmology.
  “Salmon restoration is a part of a prophecy that we’re following. The prayer
  is that it connects us back into our creation stories,” Preston said. Last
  year salmon began “coming home” to the Klamath River along the
  Oregon-California border after a hard-fought, decades-long legal battle
  spearheaded by the Karuk, Klamath, and Yurok tribal nations to remove four
  dams along the river. The project was the largest of its kind in US history.
  Conversely, a historic agreement removing dams on the Columbia River, part of
  a step to restoring Indigenous fishing rights and revitalizing north-western
  fisheries, was reversed by a Trump executive order in June. Regardless of the
  political climate, Olstad is determined to help the Winnema Wintu keep pushing
  for salmon restoration. “Every single administration has been a difficult
  administration for Indigenous peoples,” Olstad said. “It doesn’t mean that
  we’re going to stop.”
