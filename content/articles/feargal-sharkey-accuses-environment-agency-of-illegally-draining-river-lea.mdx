  The singer and environmentalist Feargal Sharkey is threatening to take the
  Environment Agency to court for draining a river that hosts the oldest fishing
  club in England and putting a rare population of brown trout at risk. The
  former Undertones frontman chairs the Amwell Magna Fishery, which has used the
  secluded stretch of the River Lea in Hertfordshire since 1841. Lawyers for the
  fishery have written to the EA to order the regulator to immediately stop
  abstracting from that section of the river, saying they will commence a
  judicial review if it does not comply. The EA has been accused of illegally
  abstracting from this section of the Lea, which hosts the only population of
  breeding brown trout on the watercourse. The fishing club says this will kill
  off the fish, which need a certain level of oxygen to live. England is in the
  grip of a devastating drought, with hosepipe bans in place in areas across the
  country and water companies asking permission to abstract water from rivers
  that are already below a viable state. Sharkey has called the EA’s actions
  “environmental vandalism unmatched in recent history”. He and the fishing club
  have enlisted the law firm Leigh Day to write a pre-action protocol letter.
  According to the letter, the EA began reducing the flow of the River Lea
  between Ware and Stanstead Abbotts on 3 June 2025, without, the letter claims,
  any statutory authority. The EA has not given a reason for the abstraction,
  but similar methods are often used to help manage the flows of other rivers in
  the area. The stretch of the river is important for many species of fish
  including trout and grayling, and is tended by the members of the fishing
  club. They have been horrified to see the Lea dwindle to a trickle. The
  ecosystem on which trout and other wildlife – including protected bird species
  such as the bittern, shoveler and gadwall – depend requires fast-moving and
  clean water. Members have also been prevented from fishing at the site because
  of the low flow. Sharkey said: “What is most extraordinary in all of this is
  that very government agency established to protect, conserve and ensure our
  river’s futures is now engaged in decimating the oldest populations of
  breeding brown trout in the River Lea, an act of environmental vandalism
  unmatched in recent history. “At a time when the regulation of our waterways
  is under such intense scrutiny you would assume that the Environment Agency
  would be desperate to do the right thing. Well, that time has come. It is now
  time to make sure that our rivers can and do have a bright, prosperous future.
  It’s time to act, it’s time to do the right thing.” The legal letter says that
  generally 156m litres of water used to flow each day in the Lea, but this was
  cut in June to 66m litres. The letter claims that on 19 June 2025, the EA
  reduced the flow further to 30m litres a day, before quickly bringing it back
  up to 66m. When the flow of water drops to these low volumes, oxygen levels
  decline, killing off the aquatic life within. The fishery falls within a site
  of special scientific interest and a special protection area, so lawyers argue
  the EA has a legal duty to protect the river. The lawyers also say the Amwell
  Magna Fishery, as a holder of fishing rights in the area, is entitled to the
  natural flow of water in the River Lea into and through the fishery, so
  interference with the flow may in law be considered as nuisance, trespass or a
  breach of statutory duty. The letter asks the EA to immediately cease
  abstraction and bring the river back to its natural flow, adding: “If we do
  not receive a satisfactory response to this letter, we propose to advise our
  client to make an application for judicial review without further recourse to
  you.” Ricardo Gama, a partner at Leigh Day, said: “Our client is perplexed by
  the Environment Agency’s inexplicable decision to alter the flow of the River
  Lea. In our client’s view, not only has this had a devastating impact on a
  stretch of the river, which is an internationally designated habitat, it has
  put at risk a brown trout conservation project that the agency itself was
  running with our client. “We have now sent a judicial review pre-action letter
  requesting that the agency urgently restores flow to our client’s stretch of
  the river.” An EA spokesperson said: “Managing water levels in our rivers is
  complex, and we constantly look to strike the right balance between the many
  demands put on them from fisheries and nature, maintaining assets such as
  flood defences, prolonged dry weather, and public water supply and navigation.
  “We are committed to working with all communities and stakeholders to improve
  our rivers, within our legal duties. We don’t comment on ongoing legal
  proceedings.”
