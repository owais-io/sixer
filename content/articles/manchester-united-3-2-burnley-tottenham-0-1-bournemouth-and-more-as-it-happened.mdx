  That’s all from me today! Be sure to join Scott Murray for minute-by-minute
  coverage of Leeds v Newcastle. In some breaking transfer news, Chelsea have
  CALLED OFF the loan transfer of Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich following the
  injury to Liam Delap today. Jackson is understood to be reluctant to return to
  England. And here’s Will Unwin’s report from Manchester United’s 3-2 win over
  Burnley: Louise Taylor was at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland managed a
  late win against Brentford: Ed Aarons was at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

  Championship: Ipswich have just scored an equaliser in the 16th (yes,
  sixteenth) minute of added time against Derby through Jack Clarke! Fernandes
  converts the penalty to all-but win it for United! Premier League: Penalty to
  Manchester United following a shirt pull on Amad Diallo from Jaidon Anthony!
  Premier League: A VAR review is currently ongoing for a potential Manchester
  United penalty… Late drama alert! From 1-0 down, Sunderland come back and are
  now on the verge of winning it thanks to Wilson Isidor! All four Premier
  League games are still live. We’ve reached full-time in some fixtures across
  the country, but there could still be some late drama… Premier League: It’s
  been pretty quiet at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this afternoon. Bournemouth
  still lead 1-0 with just under five minutes left to play. Le Fee equalises
  from the penalty spot, sending Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way and slotting
  his shot into the bottom-right corner! Wolves are back in it thanks to Rodrigo
  Gomes! Can they find an equaliser now with just over 10 minutes left to play?
  Championship: And just like that, Watford are level again! Nestory Irankunda
  with the goal against Southampton! Championship: Southampton lead Watford once
  again thanks to Ryan Manning. Elsewhere, Bristol City have increased their
  advantage against Hull. Thiago breaks the deadlock at the Stadium of Light!
  The forward heads past Robin Roefs following a cross in from the right.
  Burnley are level once again! Jaidon Anthony with the strike from close range
  following a long throw from Kyle Walker. Championship: Watford are now level
  with Southampton thanks to Kwadwo Baah. Meanwhile, Rhian Brewster has fired
  Derby ahead against Ipswich in the 70th minute. Well, that didn’t take long.
  Just one minute and 33 seconds after Foster’s equaliser, Bryan Mbeuno restores
  United’s lead! Foster gets the equaliser for Burnley at Old Trafford! The
  forward breaks free in the box to flick in a cross from Jacob Bruun Larsen.
  Premier League: Brentford have a penalty and Kevin Schade steps up to take it,
  but his attempt is saved by Robin Roefs! Championship: The deadlock has
  finally been broken at the Den. Kieffer Moore fires Wrexham into the lead
  against Millwall. Dewsbury-Hall makes it three for Everton with a powerful
  strike into the top-left corner! Another assist for Grealish. Championship:
  Carlton Morris has fired Derby level against Ipswich from the penalty spot.
  Meanwhile, Swansea have taken a 1-0 lead against Sheffield Wednesday thanks to
  Zan Vipotnik. We’re back under way in the 3pm games. Scottish Premiership

  0-1 Bristol Rovers Barnet 0-1 Colchester United Cambridge United 1-0 Newport
  County Chesterfield 0-2 Crawley Town And that’s the half-time whistle around
  the grounds. Let me bring you some scores… Championship: Sean McLoughlin has
  been shown a red card and Blackburn are down to 10 men against Norwich. The
  Canaries are also awarded a penalty and Josh Sargent converts to give them a
  1-0 lead. Championship: Portsmouth lead Preston thanks to a goal from Andre
  Dozzell. Meanwhile, Bristol have extended their advantage against Hull through
  Emil Riis. Championship: Ipswich have taken the lead against Derby at Portman
  Road. Oxford have drawn level against Coventry and Bristol lead Hull 2-1 at
  Ashton Gate. Premier League: Nightmare for Manchester United. Matheus Cunha
  goes to ground holding his hamstring and will not be able to continue. He is
  forced off. Will Benjamin Sesko replace him? No. It’s Joshua Zirkzee. Everton
  lead once again! This time through Iliman Ndiaye. A well-worked goal from the
  Toffees which culminated in a close-range strike from the edge of the six-yard
  box. A free kick is sent into the box, Casemiro heads it towards goal and his
  effort hits the crossbar, bounces down and hits Josh Cullen. The midfielder
  can’t do anything about it as the ball drops over the line. Hwang scores the
  much-needed equaliser for Wolves! Marshall Munetsi makes a run down the right
  with the ball before drilling a low cross into the box, putting it on a plate
  for the forward to fire it into the net. Premier League: A goal has been
  disallowed at the Stadium of Light. Dango Ouattara put the ball in the net for
  Brentford but the strike has been ruled out due to an offside. Premier League:
  No penalty! After a review, the penalty awarded to Manchester United was
  overturned because the contact was deemed to have been made outside the box. A
  drop-ball has instead been given to Dúbravka. Scottish Premiership Motherwell
  0-1 Kilmarnock Livingston 0-0 Hearts Premier League: Manchester United have
  been awarded a penalty following a foul on Mason Mount from Kyle Walker. VAR
  is currently reviewing it to check if the contact was made outside the box.
  League One: An own-goal from Teddy Sharman-Lowe has put Blackpool into the
  lead against Bolton. Championship: Cameron Archer strikes in the 10th minute
  to give Southampton the advantage over Watford. Meanwhile, Coventry lead
  Oxford thanks to Haji Wright. Surely we won’t see another seven goals today…
  League Two: Colchester have taken a 1-0 lead over Barnet thanks to Jack
  Tucker, while Crawley have the advantage over Chesterfield following a strike
  from Harry McKirdy. Beto strikes first at Molineux by heading past José Sá and
  into the bottom corner! Jack Grealish with another assist. League One: Jayden
  Fevrier fires Stockport into the lead against Wigan in League One. A strike
  from Evanilson deflects off Cristian Romero and loops over Guglielmo Vicario
  before bouncing into the net! Bristol City 0-1 Hull City: And the first goal
  of the afternoon comes from Hull! Joe Gelhardt with the strike. We’re under
  way in the 3pm games! Now let’s see where the first goal comes from… Mary
  Waltz has messaged in from California to say: “This Everton fan is happy that
  Strand Larson is not playing. Not very sporting. But that’s that. Fulham was
  done over by VAR. Bin it.” Scottish Premiership fixtures Motherwell 0-1
  Kilmarnock Livingston 0-0 Hearts James Humphries has messaged in to say: “Big
  day in north Lanarkshire - Killie come to fir park under our ex-manager*
  Kettlewell, who quit citing fan abuse. I must confess I never heard anything
  beyond the usual for managerial abuse, but that is a pretty ridiculous
  standard to begin with, so it will be... interesting to see what sort of
  welcome he gets. “Anyway, with the well going pretty, uh, nicely under Askou’s
  possession-based football, and Kettlewell’s Killie below us only
  alphabetically, this could be pretty tasty; especially considering Kettlewell
  is fairly combustible type (I think he had three touchline bans last season,
  and that was only up to about February). Lots to look forward to then, and
  we’ll see how cheery I am after we’ve lost to the inevitable injury-time
  sickener.” Premier League fixtures Chelsea 2-0 Fulham FT Wolves v Everton
  Tottenham v Bournemouth Manchester United v Burnley Sunderland v Brentford
  Leeds United v Newcastle (5:30pm) Goals from Joao Pedro and Enzo Fernandez
  helped Chelsea to a 2-0 win over Fulham at Stamford Bridge. The match was
  overshadowed by some controversial decisions which left Marco Silva and the
  visitors furious. Championship fixtures Stoke City 0-1 West Brom FT QPR 3-1
  Charlton Athletic FT Middlesbrough 1-0 Sheffield United FT Oxford United v
  Coventry City Bristol City v Hull City Ipswich Town v Derby County Sheffield
  Wednesday v Swansea City Millwall v Wrexham Blackburn Rovers v Norwich City

  Oldham Athletic v Gillingham Tranmere Rovers v Notts County Bromley v
  Harrogate Town MK Dons v Walsall Shrewsbury Town v Accrington Stanley Grimsby
  Town v Bristol Rovers Barnet v Colchester United Cambridge United v Newport
  County Chesterfield v Crawley Town Shaun T has messaged in to have his say on
  Ruben Amorim’s team selection: “Any thoughts on why a club in need of a
  striker would fork out 66 million quid for one (Sesko) but choose not to play
  him? Is he injured? They need goals.” To be completely honest, my guess is as
  good as yours! I don’t think he’s injured. At least, nothing has been said
  about any kind of injury. He should be fully match fit considering he had a
  full pre-season with RB Leipzig before moving to Manchester. I’d have thought
  this would have been the perfect game to put him in from the start. Like you
  say, United need goals! Jørgen Strand Larsen is not in the Wolves squad this
  afternoon amid rumours of a potential move to Newcastle. The Magpies saw two
  bids for the striker knocked back before finally signing Nick Woltemade, a
  move which was confirmed earlier today. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira said
  yesterday that Strand Larsen was being treated for a minor knock. Andre Onana
  has been dropped by Ruben Amorim for Manchester United’s match against Burnley
  this afternoon. The goalkeeper was heavily criticised for his performance
  against Grimsby on Wednesday. However, Amorim refused to point the blame at
  him. Sunderland starting lineup: Roefs, Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Mandava,
  Diarra, Xhaka, Sadiki, Talbi, Mayenda, Le Fee. Brentford starting lineup:
  Kelleher, Kayode, Collins, Van den Berg, Lewis-Potter, Yarmolyuk, Henderson,
  Ouattara, Damsgaard, Schade, Thiago. Wolves starting lineup: Sa, Bueno,
  Agbadou, Gomes, Tchatchoua, Andre, Gomes, Bueno, Munetsi, Hwang, Arias.
  Everton starting lineup: Pickford, O’Brien, Tarkowski, Keane, Mykolenko,
  Gueye, Garner; Ndiaye, Dewsbury-Hall, Grealish, Beto. Tottenham starting
  lineup: Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Spence, Sarr, Joao Palhinha,
  Bentancur, Kudus, Richarlison, Johnson. Bournemouth starting lineup: Petrovic,
  Smith, Diakite, Senesi, Truffert, Adams, Brooks, Scott, Tavernier, Semenyo,
  Evanilson. Manchester United starting lineup: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw,
  Diallo, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Dalot, Mbeumo, Mount, Cunha. Burnley
  starting lineup: Dubravka, Walker, Ekdal, Esteve, Hartman, Ugochukwu, Cullen,
  Bruun Larsen, Mejbri, Anthony, Foster. Hello, good afternoon and welcome to
  another Clockwatch. We have four Premier League fixtures to look forward to
  this afternoon, with the likes of Manchester United and Tottenham in action.
  Following their shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town midweek, United host
  Burnley at Old Trafford in what could be viewed by some as a must-win game.
  Speaking of Grimsby, they face Bristol Rovers in League Two at the same time.
  Meanwhile, Tottenham welcome Bournemouth to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as
  they look to continue their perfect start to the campaign. Elsewhere, Wolves -
  who are yet to win a Premier League match this season - take on Everton and
  Sunderland host Brentford. I’ll also bring you updates from across the EFL as
  the 3pm BST matches get under way.
