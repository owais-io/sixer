  Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, has vetoed three bills that would have
  increased pensions and disability benefits, prompting outrage from advocacy
  groups and the lawmakers who had approved the measures. The self-styled
  anarcho-capitalist claimed the bills would “break the government’s fiscal
  balance” and insisted there was “no money” to fund the measures, which the
  National Congress had approved in early July. Pensioners have been among the
  hardest hit by Milei’s so-called “chainsaw” austerity drive and have been
  holding weekly demonstrations outside congress every Wednesday, come rain or
  shine. Overriding the presidential veto would require a two-thirds majority in
  parliament. Should that happen, Milei has already announced he intends to
  challenge the bills in court. “It’s impossible to survive on a minimum
  pension,” said Eduardo Barnei, 79, from Berazategui on the outskirts of Buenos
  Aires, who said he received 370,000 pesos last month (about £205), including a
  70,000-peso bonus. One of the bills vetoed by Milei proposed a 7.2% increase
  for all pensions and would have raised the monthly bonus to 110,000 pesos.
  Even with the adjustment, the total would still fall well short of the
  1,200,523 pesos (£662) that the Defensoría de la Tercera Edad – an ombudsman
  for older people – estimates as the minimum monthly cost of living for a
  pensioner. “[Last month] I had to spend more than 100,000 pesos on medicine,
  another 80,000 on gas and electricity, and now I have to survive on what’s
  left. It’s just not possible,” said Barnei, who began working at 15 and
  continued until his retirement at 68. “Life is very difficult,” said Edda
  Beitia, 77, from the greater Buenos Aires area, who has been attending the
  weekly pensioners’ protests – often outnumbered by security forces including
  military, federal and naval police, who try to stop them from blocking roads,
  frequently using force, including by firing teargas and rubber bullets. In
  March, after football supporters joined pensioners in protest, 124
  demonstrators were detained and 46 people were injured in clashes with
  security forces – among them a photographer who was seriously wounded after
  being struck in the head by a teargas canister. “I keep coming to the protests
  every week because I think of all the pensioners who, like me, are struggling.
  This fight is a collective fight,” said Beitia. Milei also vetoed a law that
  would have allowed women over 60 and men over 65 to retire even if they had
  not completed the required 30 years of pension contributions. The third bill
  would have established a pension for people with disabilities and granted
  access to a medical care programme – but it too was entirely vetoed by the
  far-right president. The government argued the new laws would result in
  additional spending of more than 7tn pesos (£3.8bn) in 2025 and about 17tn
  pesos (£9.3bn) in 2026, describing the measures as “irresponsible” for failing
  to specify the source of funding. “And even if the veto were overturned, we’ll
  take it to court,” Milei said three weeks ago. In a statement on Monday, the
  government declared: “There is no money, and the only way to make Argentina
  great again is through effort and honesty – not by repeating the same old
  recipes.” Several lawmakers condemned the government’s decision. Senator Pablo
  Blanco called it “regrettable and shameful”, while Senator Oscar Parrilli
  described it as “a policy of cruelty towards the most vulnerable sectors of
  society”. “We are barely surviving but many of us now have to help our
  children who have lost their jobs,” said Beitia. “I also think about all the
  young people who will never get to retire. The government should be ashamed of
  themselves for what they are doing.”
