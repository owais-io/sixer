  Pick of the week Hostage Abigail Dalton has assured her husband, Alex, that
  becoming prime minister won’t stop her from making the right decisions for her
  family. This is then tested painfully. Dalton (Suranne Jones) is already
  facing a tough negotiation with the French president, Vivienne Toussaint
  (Julie Delpy), who is wooing the far right in the name of re-election and
  hardballing her on the subject of immigration. When Alex is kidnapped in
  French Guiana, his fate is in Toussaint’s hands. But she has a personal
  weakness that makes her an easy target for blackmail. Certain aspects of
  Hostage feel generic but it’s pacy and gripping and the two leads bounce off
  each other with captivating frenemy relish. Netflix, from Thursday 21 August
  *** Long Story Short Exciting news for BoJack Horseman fans: creator Raphael
  Bob-Waksberg explores the triumphs and tragedies of the loving but
  dysfunctional Schwooper family in this new animation. It’s told via a series
  of narrative jumps between childhood and adulthood, locating a perfect balance
  between the delightful, infuriating triviality of family life and the big
  stuff that gives context to the everyday. In common with Bob-Waksberg’s
  previous show, it packs a hefty emotional punch. And don’t be afraid to get
  invested in these likable, slightly hapless characters – season two has
  already been confirmed. Netflix, from Friday 22 August *** The Real Housewives
  of London Another bout of soul-crushing affluenza, this time introducing the
  London arm of a franchise that has, since 2006, found a comfortable niche in
  monetising pathological deficits of self-awareness. The six squabbling
  socialites include Juliet Angus and Caroline Stanbury whom fans of the genre
  may remember from Bravo’s Ladies of London and The Real Housewives of Dubai.
  While this pair have the benefit of experience, their companions soon get into
  the swing – it’s a feast of big houses, garish frocks, status-led conflict and
  overuse of the word “iconic”. Hayu, from Monday 18 August *** America’s Team:
  The Gambler and His Cowboys “This is a soap opera, 365 days a year.” Dallas
  Cowboys owner, president and general manager Jerry Jones is describing his NFL
  team but he’s also offering an insight into why the readymade narratives of
  sports teams are currently so irresistible to documentary-makers on streaming
  platforms. This series has a wider scope than most, telling the story of the
  rise of the Cowboys through the 90s and the controversies that accompanied
  them on their route to three NFL titles. It’s slick, glossy and very pleased
  with itself. Netflix, from Tuesday 19 August *** The Twisted Tale of Amanda
  Knox This eight-part drama is written from the point of view of Amanda Knox,
  who was initially convicted of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher before
  being acquitted on appeal. The tone is uncertain, going from oddly jaunty to
  melodramatic, and its foregrounding of Knox’s story won’t be to everyone’s
  taste – hardly surprising, given that she (and Monica Lewinsky) executive
  produced the show. But it does capture the sense of rising panic as,
  surrounded by legal proceedings she barely understands, Knox starts to realise
  how much trouble she’s in. Disney+, from Wednesday 20 August *** Invasion At
  times during its first two seasons, this divisive sci-fi show has achieved the
  seemingly impossible by making an alien invasion of Earth seem humdrum. As the
  third instalment arrives, it’s still hard to shake off the feeling that
  Invasion should be better than it is – it is brave to keep the focus on the
  Earthlings and not the extraterrestrials but that can make the show feel like
  a slow burn. Still, action is surely in the offing this time as survivors from
  around the world must band together on a mission to infiltrate the aliens’
  mothership. Apple TV+, from Friday 22 August *** The Truth About Jussie
  Smollett? The bizarre story of the allegedly racist and homophobic hate attack
  against actor Jussie Smollett began in 2019 and ended in him serving six days
  in prison in 2022 for apparently staging the incident with two acquaintances.
  The conviction was later overturned, but the fallout has seriously damaged
  Smollett’s career. This documentary (from the producers of Don’t F**k With
  Cats) looks set to reignite the controversy. Could Smollett’s story have been
  true all along? It features interviews with police, lawyers and investigators
  who claim to have found new facts about the case. Netflix, from Friday 22
  August
