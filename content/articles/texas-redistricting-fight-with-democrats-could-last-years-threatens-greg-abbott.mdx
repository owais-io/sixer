  The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has stepped up his war of words with
  Democratic lawmakers who have left the state to foil an aggressive
  redistricting plan aimed at giving his Republican party five additional seats
  in Congress, saying on Sunday that the fight “could literally last years”.
  Abbott issued his new threat on Fox News Sunday, saying that he would use his
  powers to call a special session of the Texas legislature to extend the battle
  indefinitely. The special session lasts 30 days, he said, “and as soon as this
  one is over, I’m going to call another one, then another one, then another
  one, then another one”. Whenever the absent Democrats return to Texas, Abbott
  said, they would be arrested for violating their oath of office. “If they want
  to evade that arrest, they’re going to stay outside Texas for literally
  years,” he remarked. “And they might as well start voting in California or
  Illinois, or wherever they may be.” Sunday’s TV political talkshows were
  dominated by the increasingly acrimonious dispute over Texas’s audacious
  gerrymandering plans, which were instigated at the direct behest of Donald
  Trump. The move to flip five US House seats to the Republicans is being made
  as polls indicate that the US president’s party will struggle to hang on to
  its razor-slim majority in the chamber in next year’s midterm elections. The
  Republicans currently hold a margin of just three seats. The stakes could not
  be higher: were Trump able to hang on to his narrow control of Congress, he
  could cement the attacks on democratic and constitutional norms that he has
  begun in the first six months of his second presidency. As the crisis reaches
  a crunch, more than 50 Texas Democrats have left the state, heading to
  Democratic-controlled states, including Illinois and New York. The relocation
  is designed to deprive Republicans of a quorum needed to pass the new
  gerrymandered maps in the Texas legislature in Austin. Democratic governors
  went on the political shows on Sunday to launch their own barrage of words
  threatening counter-action. The strong language deployed was the latest
  indication that the leadership of the Democratic party, which has floundered
  in the face of Trump’s radical authoritarian-leaning tactics, is determined at
  this point to take a stand. New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul,
  accused Abbott on Fox News Sunday of being a “lap dog” for Trump. “Knock it
  off,” she told her counterpart in Texas. “Let’s get back to governing.” She
  added that if Texas continued with what she called “these games”, “we’re not
  going to sit on the sidelines – we’re New Yorkers. We fight back.” New York’s
  room for maneuver, however, is more limited than that of Texas. The state has
  an independent redistricting commission that oversees the drawing of its
  electoral maps which has been the subject in recent years of much court
  action. Hochul said that the restrictions would not hold New York back. “We
  amend constitutions – we did it a few years ago,” she said. “We can put it to
  the people. I’m not going to let our democracy be eroded away because there’s
  a blatant power grab in our nation’s capital.” JB Pritzker, the Democratic
  governor of Illinois where many of the Texas Democrats are holed up in an
  undisclosed hotel outside Chicago, unleashed his own verbal volley on NBC’s
  Meet the Press. He accused Trump of being a cheater, saying: “He cheats on his
  wives. He cheats at golf. And now he’s trying to cheat the American people out
  of their votes.” Pritzker was dismissive of claims by the Texas US senator
  John Cornyn that the FBI had been brought in to help find the missing
  Democrats. “Texas law does not apply in the state of Illinois, and there’s no
  federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that’s here visiting
  our state,” Pritzker said. “So, it’s a lot of grandstanding.” As the governors
  were thrashing it out in the TV studios, lawsuits continued to fly around
  Texas’s courts as both sides seek to gain the upper hand legally. Texas’s
  attorney general, Ken Paxton, is suing a sample group of 13 of the Democratic
  lawmakers claiming that the “runaways” have officially vacated their offices.
  Paxton is now asking the state’s supreme court to remove the 13 from their
  seats. Beto O’Rourke, the former Democratic presidential candidate from El
  Paso, Texas, has also waded into the fray. On Friday, a state court in Fort
  Worth blocked his political action committee, Powered By People, from using
  its funds to support the fleeing lawmakers. O’Rourke has counter-sued, arguing
  that Paxton was trying to “intimidate” a potential rival in next year’s US
  Senate race. Speaking at an event in New Orleans on Friday, he accused the
  Republicans of being “would-be fascists” and warned that if they got away with
  their plan to maintain power in Congress in 2026 “the consolidation of
  authoritarian control in the hands of Donald Trump will be nearly
  unstoppable”. Trump’s ruse to create more winnable congressional seats is
  being taken so seriously in Democratic circles that it has gelled even diehard
  opponents of party political gerrymandering to come out in favor of
  counter-measures. Bernie Sanders, the independent US senator from Vermont, is
  a fierce critic of the redrawing of electoral maps for partisan benefit. Yet
  he told CNN’s State of the Union that the Democratic party had no option but
  to fight fire with fire, saying: “Democrats have got to fight back. I think
  it’s pathetic, but I think that’s what they’ve got to do.” Asked whether his
  position was defensible, given his years of opposing gerrymandering, Sanders
  said: “What we have now is terrible, and Republicans are making it worse.
  Well, what do you do if Republicans are doing it? You have to respond. It’s
  pathetic, but I think you have to respond.”
