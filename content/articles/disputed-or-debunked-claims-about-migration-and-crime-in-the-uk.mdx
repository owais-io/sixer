  Several politicians have got into hot water for promoting and repeating
  misleading data in recent months, particularly about migration and crime.
  There have been calls for the government and police forces to be more
  transparent about the figures to tackle misinformation and hysteria. Here are
  some of the high-profile claims that have been disputed or debunked. Are
  foreign nationals responsible for 40% of sexual crime in London? Conservative
  Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said on Radio 4’s Today
  programme on Monday that 40% of sexual crimes in London last year were
  committed by foreign nationals. The claim was sourced from the Centre for
  Migration Control (CMC), a thinktank and blog that describes its purpose as
  “controlling and reducing migration to Britain”. It is run by the Reform UK
  activist Robert Bates. CMC’s claims come from the Metropolitan police’s
  response to a freedom of information request. The Met issued a breakdown of
  the number of people who had been proceeded against – ie brought before a
  court – for sexual offences by nationality. This does not mean they have been
  found guilty of committing the offence as Jenrick said. For example, there
  were 14,242 defendants brought to court for sexual offences at magistrates
  courts in England and Wales in 2024, but 8,098 convictions, according to
  Ministry of Justice statistics. “Some of the data we’re seeing is very
  striking,” Jenrick also said. “Afghans and Eritrean nationals are 20 times
  more likely to be convicted of a sexual crime than a British national.” The
  statistic about Afghans has been repeated by Reform UK’s chair, Zia Yusuf.
  This is a muddled figure that also came from the CMC, after it submitted
  freedom of information requests to the MoJ. It is based on population
  statistics from 2021 but data on offences covering the years between 2021 and
  2023. That means the statistic is likely to be based on a significant
  underestimate of the number of Afghan and Eritrean nationals in the UK –
  meaning the comparison with British rates is unlikely to be 20 times as high.
  Immigration to the UK from Afghanistan has risen significantly since 2021
  because of the Taliban’s return to power, while Eritrean migration has also
  risen due to wars in Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia. The Guardian contacted
  Jenrick for comment. Are the police protecting illegal migrants working for
  Deliveroo? Nick Timothy, the Conservative MP for West Suffolk, deleted a post
  on X this week that accused the Metropolitan police of “facilitating illegal
  working”. He had shared a photo that appeared to show police officers
  escorting a Deliveroo driver through a crowd of protesters outside a hotel.
  The original post claimed to depict how “an illegal Deliveroo worker is
  literally getting a full police escort”. The Met replied that “this person was
  delivering to the hotel, they were not being accommodated there. There is no
  evidence to suggest they were working illegally. They were surrounded and
  intimidated by those gathered outside and officers intervened to make sure
  they got away safely.” The context is that companies including Deliveroo, Just
  Eat and Uber Eats have committed to tighten security checks after reports some
  asylum seekers were working illegally as couriers. Are one in 12 people in
  London illegal migrants? Earlier this year, there was a controversy over a
  Telegraph front page report that said as many as one in 12 people living in
  London were illegal immigrants. The story included quotes from Chris Philp,
  the Conservative shadow home secretary, who called the figures “deeply
  alarming” and said it was “totally unacceptable to have these numbers of
  illegal immigrants in the UK”. The Telegraph and several other newspapers had
  to issue corrections for misrepresenting the findings in several ways. The one
  in 12 statistic was based on an unpublished study commissioned by Thames Water
  to measure the demand for water supply. The study concluded that there could
  be between 390,355 and 585,533 irregular – not illegal – migrants in and
  around London. The Telegraph used the higher figure and divided it by the 7
  million population living in specific “water resource zones”, rather than the
  9 million population of London. Most importantly, the Thames Water study was
  seeking to estimate the number of people who use water that are not in
  official statistics so included not just migrants but those with second homes,
  visitors and tourists. It also included people given indefinite leave to
  remain, as well as some British-born children of migrants with irregular
  status. The most recent official estimates for the number of irregular
  migrants in the UK date from 2017. The Pew Research Center said the number was
  between 800,000 to 1.2 million, while the Greater London Authority’s central
  estimate for the whole of the UK was 674,000 – going up to 809,000 when
  including UK-born children of unauthorised migrants. Why are we talking about
  this now? At a press conference on Monday, Nigel Farage told TV crews that he
  would discuss an open criminal investigation – the alleged rape of a child.
  But he said there would be nothing in the press conference that would go
  against contempt of court laws. Two men have been charged in connection with
  the alleged crime. When an alleged perpetrator has been charged, there are
  strict rules about what can be reported, to prevent prejudicing and
  potentially collapsing a trial. However, the leader of Warwickshire county
  council, George Finch, later made a number of references, including referring
  to the men as “criminals” when they have not been found guilty. Farage then
  defended Finch when questioned as to whether he had broken contempt laws,
  saying it was “good” that he had become “slightly emotional”. The issue of
  naming the race of alleged perpetrators has been in the public eye since a
  baseless social media conspiracy theory surrounding Axel Rudakubana, the
  Southport murderer. After he killed three young children in July 2024, it was
  purported on social media that authorities were covering up his true place of
  birth. Rudakubana, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was falsely
  portrayed in a variety of social media posts as being a Muslim asylum seeker.
