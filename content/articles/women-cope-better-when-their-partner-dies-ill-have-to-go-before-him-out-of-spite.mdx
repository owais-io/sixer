  spite

  David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with
  defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an
  unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring
  way to women,” he told the Sunday Times. “Because they do it to each other,
  and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.” In the same
  interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner Robert Webb are asked how each
  counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They
  are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed
  such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says
  Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I
  never really know.” This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark revealed
  what he has learned from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never
  really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he
  admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best
  friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner
  can be that.” Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by David
  Mitchell, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are
  in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course,
  there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a
  mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real
  chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something
  huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for
  the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll
  shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow
  unaware he was meant to. Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice
  versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about
  themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We
  check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot
  twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together.
  How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh
  successfully so both parties get what they need? But perhaps bigger, and more
  important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with
  your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of
  pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards
  roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure
  he’s my best friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and
  insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse,
  an email address. Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his
  answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then
  gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were
  there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed
  me and this guy up or something. “Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied,
  immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead
  of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my
  husband isn’t my best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be his. Want
  and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder
  it. Welcome to marriage. The disparate ways the genders relate are also the
  reason widows are “way happier” than widowers after the death of a spouse,
  says Harvard professor, author and happiness scientist Arthur C Brooks.
  “Widowers do really poorly generally, men do very poorly, and part of the
  reason is because – this data is disputed but more or less it’s directionally
  correct – 60% of 60-year-old men say their best friend is their wife, 30% of
  their wives say their best friend is their husband,” he mansplains … sorry,
  explains. “Women have more relationships, they have closer, deeper love
  relationships with non-related kin and with the adult children, typically,
  than the husband does.” My husband, the outlier. Clearly, I will have to die
  before him, out of spite, to teach him the error of his ways. If he dares to
  call me his best friend in his eulogy, please feel free to heckle.
