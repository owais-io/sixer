  The Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap have cancelled their scheduled US tour dates in
  October, citing the proximity to a court hearing in London involving band
  member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh’s alleged mid-performance display of a Hezbollah
  flag. Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged with
  a terrorism offence in the UK in May after being accused of displaying a flag
  in support of Hezbollah during a concert in London last November. The
  27-year-old from Belfast has denied the offence – and the group have said that
  they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and claim that the footage of the
  incident was taken out of context and was being “exploited and weaponised”. In
  a statement shared on social media on Monday, the band announced the US tour
  cancellation, saying: “Due to the proximity of our next court hearing in
  London to the first date of the tour” they have to “cancel all 15 tour dates
  in October”. “With every show fully sold out, to tens of thousands of fans,
  this is news we are sad to deliver,” they added. “But once we win our court
  case, which we will, we promise to embark on an even bigger tour to all you
  great heads.” Ó hAnnaidh’s next court hearing is set for 26 September, during
  which a chief magistrate is expected to decide whether he will stand trial.
  His legal team has argued that the case should be thrown out, citing a
  technical error in how the charge was brought. Ó hAnnaidh was greeted by
  hundreds of supporters as he arrived at Westminster magistrates court for a
  hearing recently. When the charge was first announced earlier this year,
  Kneecap described it as “political policing” and a “carnival of distraction”
  and vowed to “vehemently defend ourselves”. While their US tour dates have
  been cancelled, the band said on Monday that they had an upcoming surprise for
  US fans. “We will be sharing something very special for US fans next week so
  that we can still link with you all in October,” it reads. “It’s top secret
  for now, but all will be revealed next week.” The group confirmed that their
  planned Canadian shows in Vancouver and Toronto will still proceed as planned.
  The Belfast-based group – known for their political performances and outspoken
  support for Palestine – made headlines in June during their Glastonbury set,
  where they led chants saying “fuck Keir Starmer,” referring to the UK prime
  minister. In April, the rap trio also made headlines for displaying statements
  against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza at the Coachella festival.
