  Enzo Suma, a naturalist guide, has always picked up rubbish during his walks
  along Carovigno beach, a stretch of coastline lapped by clear blue waters
  close to his home in Salento, an area of Puglia in the heel of Italy’s boot.
  During one walk, Suma, 44, spotted a washed-up bottle of Ambre Solaire
  sunscreen. He was about to throw it away when he noticed something unusual:
  the price printed on the bottle was in lire, meaning it must have been
  produced before the euro replaced the lira in Italy. In fact, after delving
  further, he was astonished to discover that the bottle dated back to the late
  1960s. A clear testament to the longevity of plastic and its persistence in
  the environment, the vintage suntan lotion became the catalyst for Suma’s
  creation of Archeoplastica, an online museum that comprises more than 500
  plastic relics washed ashore on beaches all over Italy. “Whereas before I
  didn’t pay too much attention to what I collected, from that moment on I
  started to look at everything very, very carefully,” said Suma, who studied
  environmental science at Ca’ Foscari university in Venice before returning to
  Puglia. He added: “It’s one thing to be taught that plastic lasts for
  centuries and never degrades, and another to see it with your own eyes.” About
  11m tonnes of plastic waste ends up in the world’s oceans each year via rivers
  or after being dumped by people along shorelines or chucked into the sea from
  fishing vessels. A new expert review published last week warned that plastics
  were a “grave, growing and under-recognised danger” to human and planetary
  health. The review concluded that the world was in a “plastics crisis”, the
  driver being the huge acceleration in plastics production since the 1950s. The
  timeline of relics gathered by Suma and his volunteers across Italy
  demonstrates this. One of the oldest finds – a 1958 bottle cap featuring the
  trademark Moplen that was found on a beach in Emilia-Romagna region, northern
  Italy – points to the beginning of the plastic-production era. Moplen was the
  commercial name for isotactic polypropylene, a plastic material developed by
  the company Montecatini. Other discoveries include a pink polyethylene bottle
  for talcum powder that was made in Germany in the late 1950s; a blue tub of
  hand cream dating to the 1960s with the brand name Gli Sette still clearly
  visible; and a clown-shaped bottle once filled with honey that was produced
  and only ever sold in Greece, also in the 1960s, but which turned up on a
  beach in the Lecce area of Puglia. Finds of products made in subsequent
  decades include a Spic &amp; Span bathroom cleaning powder from the 1970s, a
  Nesquik tub from the 80s and the remains of a souvenir Italia ‘90 World Cup
  football. The most recent discovery, which is yet to be officially added to
  the Archeoplastica inventory, is a 45rpm vinyl record picked up on a beach by
  a seven-year-old boy who was in Puglia on holiday with his family. After
  Suma’s nephew miraculously managed to bend the record back in the shape, it
  was played on an old turntable and was revealed to be Jimmy Fontana’s Il
  Mondo, a song released in 1965. “This find struck me a lot,” said Suma. “The
  record jumped a lot but you could clearly make out the song.” Barnacle
  encrustations found on the record indicated that it had been floating in the
  sea for quite some time. Most of the work by Suma and his team is done during
  autumn and winter, when tonnes of plastic waste is left behind by beachgoers
  and authorities pay less attentionto keeping the beaches clean. The vast
  majority of waste they find are single-use plastics such as bottles, bags,
  fast-food containers and straws. The objective of Archeoplastica, which
  occasionally exhibits its finds at traditional museums, is to raise awareness
  and encourage people to limit their use of plastic. But from Suma’s
  experience, the problem is only getting worse, especially with no meaningful
  progress towards limiting plastic production. The sea, meanwhile, is taking
  its revenge. “The ocean is spitting our rubbish back in our faces,” he said.
