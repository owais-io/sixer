  When Paul Keating stepped into a noisy kitchen in a Melbourne function centre
  for an interview with John Laws, he didn’t mince his words. It was 14 May 1986
  when the then Labor treasurer told Laws that without some serious changes, a
  collapse in export prices meant our trade-dependent country was living beyond
  its means and fast on its way to becoming “a banana republic”. “If this
  government cannot get the adjustment, get manufacturing going again and keep
  moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is
  basically done for,” Keating told Laws. Sign up: AU Breaking News email It was
  that sense of urgency – the threat of a “banana republic” – that helped blow
  away the cobwebs of complacency and drive the massive reforms of the 1980s and
  1990s. Australia in the decades since has prospered. Yet once again we are
  having similar conversations. The economy doesn’t seem to be functioning as it
  should, and may only be capable of growing at a fraction of the rate it used
  to. The budget is in structural deficit. The population is ageing, and our
  demand for government services grows and grows, even as our capacity to fund
  that extra spending goes the other way. Younger Australians are increasingly
  resentful about their lot, homes are too expensive and the world outside our
  shores looks more dangerous than it has in decades. Used to being a standout
  on the global stage, we are being relegated to the back of the pack. Living
  standards across the rich world climbed by an average of 22% over the past
  decade. In comparison, our living standards are up just 1.5%, according to
  analysis by Chris Richardson, an independent economist. Analysts place a lot
  of the blame for this on a slowdown on one thing: productivity growth. They
  point to the fact that our economy is no more productive now than it was in
  2016. Over the longer term, productivity growth is the ingredient that
  delivers higher real wages, generates better-quality goods and helps pay for
  government services. Technological change can explain a lot of productivity
  growth over the decades. The promise of artificial intelligence is that it
  ignites an explosion of new growth as AI embeds itself deeper into the economy
  and our lives. With so much apparently at stake, Chalmers in a recent
  interview was asked if flatlining national productivity was a “crisis”. “No,”
  the treasurer said, “but it’s a big challenge”. Australia and Australians have
  a lot of “big challenges”, and some are regularly referred to as “crises”. Yet
  not all are worthy of a three-day economic reform roundtable with 900
  submissions and 40 ministerial mini-roundtables leading up to it. At the
  National Press Club on 18 June, Chalmers declared that the government has “a
  responsibility to rebuild confidence in liberal democratic politics and
  economic institutions – by lifting living standards for working people in
  particular”. Days out from the start of the roundtable, Chalmers has been at
  pains to play down the very reform fervour that he fanned. Anthony Albanese
  appears to have little appetite for spending political capital in pushing
  through tough economic reforms. The PM has made it clear that there will be –
  read his lips – no new taxes this term. The treasurer has obediently narrowed
  the scope of the potential “deliverables” to regulatory reform to get more
  homes built, with a side promise of some progress on longstanding policy
  ideas, like a road user charge. A crisis? Or just a malaise? The lack of a
  “crisis” in productivity may make it hard to understand why we have spent
  nearly six weeks leading up to this talkfest in Canberra. But it does help
  explain the apparent lack of urgency to solve the issue. So what do economists
  reckon: do we have a productivity crisis? The answer, Richardson quips,
  “depends whether you like rising living standards or not”. Are we a commodity
  price collapse away from becoming a 21st-century version of Keating’s “banana
  republic”? Saul Eslake, another independent economist, says no – the economy
  now is totally transformed. Rather than crisis, Eslake volunteers the word
  “malaise”. “I don’t think it would help the debate to call it a productivity
  crisis,” he adds – that could lead to rushed and short-term measures that
  might just goose the economy for a year or two. “There are no magic bullets,
  no short-term solutions. Nothing that can be done, even with the greatest
  amount of political will, to lift productivity growth in 12 months’ time,”
  Eslake says. John Hawkins, an economics professor at the University of
  Canberra, says productivity is not a crisis because it’s “not something that
  is making people worse off”. Instead: “It’s a lost opportunity to make us
  better off”. “We got used to the idea that incomes go up over time. Over the
  long run most of that increase has come from productivity,” Hawkins says.
  “More recently we got away with low productivity growth because commodities
  were strong, but we need to do something if we want real income growth going
  forward.” Shadows of the 1980s, then, from which we can expect echoes of that
  era’s reforms.
