  On the evening of 6 July 1988, the Piper Alpha oil production platform in the
  North Sea suffered a catastrophic gas explosion, followed by a conflagration
  that destroyed the structure; 167 people were killed, and almost all the
  physical evidence of what had occurred became charred debris, lost to the
  waves. After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete
  picture of the event, for reasons that also make it a hard subject for
  documentary-makers. Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story copes with the
  challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped
  from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform’s
  layout to give us the fullest picture possible. It doesn’t have the
  special-effects budget that would be required to simulate the ferocity of the
  fire or the intensity of the thick, black smoke – possibly no amount of
  pyrotechnics or CGI would be able to do that anyway – so reconstructions of
  the disaster itself are kept to a minimum. Instead, the focus is on the verbal
  responses given by survivors to the inquiry, which have been dramatised. It’s
  excellent work by a cast of little-known actors, made all the more powerful by
  them using nothing but a chair, a table and the transcript. Context is
  provided by archive newsreel, and by the wives and children of the men who
  were aboard Piper Alpha, who talk of families reluctantly adjusting to a life
  where the father/husband would be absent and hard to contact for a fortnight
  at a time. These were ordinary working people, carried out to sea by economic
  forces beyond their control: the daughter of one survivor explains how her dad
  ended up as an employee of the billion-dollar US oil company Occidental after
  the Linwood car factory near Glasgow, a major Scottish employer, shut down in
  1981. As Letter from America by The Proclaimers plays in the background (with
  its lyrics of “Linwood no more …”), we see Margaret Thatcher cosying up to
  flamboyant Occidental boss Armand Hammer, promising his lavish investment in
  Piper Alpha and other North Sea oil-production platforms and rigs would surely
  trickle down to benefit all. Another clip is a bewildering nugget from the pop
  culture of oil-rush Britain, taken from Shirley Bassey’s eponymous 1976 BBC TV
  show: Bassey stands on a North Sea rig in hard hat and overalls, surrounded by
  men grappling with greasy drilling equipment, belting out Everything’s Coming
  Up Roses. Occidental’s safety and maintenance procedures would later be
  gravely criticised by the inquiry, but the aftermath of the Piper Alpha
  calamity and the families’ fight for justice is to come in two further
  episodes of Disaster at Sea. For now, we are in the “iron village” of the rig
  itself, as horror unfolds with extraordinary power and speed. For children of
  the 1980s, Piper Alpha is one of a handful of notorious disasters that
  punctuated the decade, alongside Chornobyl, Lockerbie and the Challenger space
  shuttle – in its mechanics, it’s nearest to Chornobyl, as it begins with red
  lights blinking on a control panel, warning men who know their workplace is
  potentially lethal that something is slightly wrong. Before anyone has time to
  remedy the situation, something is terribly wrong. Those statements from the
  inquiry tell a bleak story of men left helplessly confused by the enveloping
  smoke and by the lack of guidance. They relied on Piper Alpha’s default safety
  protocol, which was to gather in the dining area at the top of the platform in
  the event of a fire: it was just beneath the helipad, from which airlifts to
  safety would be organised. But men towards the bottom of the structure
  immediately realised they couldn’t climb upwards, and those who did make it to
  the dining room merely found themselves trapped in a dark room that rapidly
  became unbearably hot and smoky, and which didn’t give them a view of the rest
  of the platform. The programme highlights telling, horrifying and strange
  details, from the men in the dining room using squashed tomatoes to cool
  themselves since there was no water at hand, to the film-maker riding with RAF
  Search and Rescue who heard a pilot’s transmission stating the fire was
  visible from 120 miles away. One Piper Alpha worker casually took a book with
  him as he evacuated, to read on the rescue vessel he assumed would save him
  soon; minutes later, he was in a group that disagreed about which staircase to
  sprint down. The men who chose the wrong staircase died. The shocking story is
  skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors’ words, as the
  actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their
  experience. A grim and difficult task is performed with care. • The first part
  of the three-part series Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story aired on BBC
  Two and the whole series is available on iPlayer
