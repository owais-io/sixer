  The state of Florida has appealed against a federal judge’s order that the
  harsh immigration jail in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz”
  must close within the next two months, a ruling that pumps the brakes on
  Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation agenda. The Miami district court judge
  Kathleen Williams said state and federal authorities broke numerous
  environmental laws as they raced to build the tented facility at a disused
  airstrip in the fragile wetlands. Since it opened in early July, touted by
  Trump as a base for the “the most vicious people on the planet” awaiting
  deportation, “Alligator Alcatraz” has built a reputation for brutality.
  Detainees have reported “inhumane” conditions including extreme heat, insects,
  and a lack of food and functioning toilet facilities. The state filed a notice
  of appeal to the 11th US circuit court in Atlanta on Thursday night, within an
  hour of Williams’s preliminary injunction halting the intake of new detainees
  at the facility and setting a 60-day deadline for its dismantling. Immigration
  advocates said on Friday that they believed only about 340 detainees were left
  at the camp after a concerted effort by officials to depopulate the facility
  in anticipation of the ruling. Authorities in Florida have previously said its
  capacity would be up to 3,000. Attorneys for the defendants, which include the
  Florida emergency management department and federal Department of Homeland
  Security, will ask the panel to stay the order as legal arguments continue in
  the case. They are expected to continue to assert that federal laws, including
  the requirement for an environmental impact study, do not apply because the
  jail was set up, managed and operated by the state of Florida using taxpayers’
  money, independently of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice).
  Williams, however, dispelled that argument in her comprehensive 82-page ruling
  that made a distinct connection with the Trump administration. “The project
  was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal
  funding; constructed in compliance with Ice standards; staffed by deputized
  Ice task force officers acting under color of federal authority and at the
  direction and supervision of Ice officials,” she wrote. “[It] exists for the
  sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration
  enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and
  deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. The
  court will adhere to the time-tested adage: ‘If it walks like a duck, quacks
  like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’” At a press conference
  on Friday, an alliance of environmental groups that filed the lawsuit said it
  was “cautiously optimistic” that the appeals court would uphold Williams’s
  order of closure. But it warned that the legal fight was still in its early
  stages. The case could eventually end up before the US supreme court, which
  has returned a number of favorable rulings to the Trump government in recent
  months. “We’re prepared to meet that motion to stay with the same energy,
  vigor, with the law and the facts, that we brought to seeking the injunction
  in the first place,” said Paul Schwiep, an attorney representing the groups
  including Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity,
  Earthjustice and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Curtis Osceola,
  senior policy adviser to the Miccosukee Tribe, welcomed Williams’s questioning
  of the location of the camp, built in a remote part of the Everglades
  surrounded by a national preserve and the tribe’s ancestral homelands. “The
  judge kept asking, ‘Why in the Everglades? Can anyone tell me why?’ – and no
  one could answer that clearly from the government,” he said. “It was obvious
  there was no explanation, other than this was a publicity stunt.” Florida’s
  Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, who advocated vociferously for the jail and
  toured it with Trump when it opened last month, did not immediately comment on
  the ruling. His communications director, Alex Lanfranconi, posted a pithy
  reaction to X on Thursday that said: “The deportations will continue until
  morale improves.” Neither the White House nor homeland security department has
  yet offered comment. Democratic politicians in Florida, however, have welcomed
  the jail’s ordered closure. “It’s about damn time,” Congresswoman Frederica
  Wilson said in a statement. “After so much pressure from me and my colleagues,
  finally Alligator Alcatraz is closing down. “It was cruel, careless, and
  destructive from the start and should have never been built.” Maxwell Frost, a
  congressman who visited the camp on Tuesday, hailed the ruling as “a major
  victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment”. He said: “The
  Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored,
  government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants
  in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer.
  “But our fight doesn’t end here. I remain committed to holding this
  administration accountable, and I will continue to show up unannounced to this
  and any other facility like it in Florida and across the country to protect
  innocent immigrants who are being racially targeted.” DeSantis announced
  earlier this month that the state would soon open a second immigration jail at
  a disused prison near Gainesville, in northern Florida, to increase capacity.
