  Radiohead have entered the US singles chart with a song from their album OK
  Computer that has gone viral on social media 28 years after its release. Let
  Down, the third single from the British band’s 1997 album, entered at No 91 on
  the Billboard Hot 100 this week after rising in popularity on TikTok. It marks
  only the fourth time the band have charted in the US. In 2008, the song Nude,
  from the album In Rainbows, entered the chart at No 37 for one week. Before
  that, 1995’s High and Dry peaked at No 78, staying on the Billboard 100 for
  eight weeks. The band’s most successful single in the US is Creep, released in
  1993, which stayed in the charts for 20 weeks, peaking at No 34. The band have
  been far more commercially successful in Britain, having scored seven Top 10
  singles. Let Down spent seven weeks on the UK singles chart when it was
  released, peaking at No 85. The song was used in the season one finale of
  Disney+’s hit show The Bear but has soared in popularity on TikTok in recent
  months, with users commenting on the song’s emotional nature. The most liked
  video using the song shows AI-generated fictional couples from famous films
  taking a selfie with their imaginary children. It has racked up 4.2m likes.
  Another viral video shows a man looking around before approaching his wife
  with the words on screen: “Why am I crying at this video of my husband looking
  for me and then finally finding me.” OK Computer is widely considered one of
  the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was added to the Library of
  Congress’s National Recording Registry. The band has not released an album
  since A Moon Shaped Pool in 2016. In March, they registered a new limited
  liability partnership, RHEUK25 LLP, prompting speculation that a new project
  is under way. Band members came together last summer to rehearse before an
  expected reunion. Colin Greenwood, the band’s bassist and brother of the lead
  guitarist and keyboardist, Johnny, told NME: “We got together in the summer
  just for a couple of days and just ran through all the songs and picked up
  where we left off in 2018. It was really fun and nice to see everyone. “We
  were going to do three or four days but knocked it on the head after two
  because it was fine and we could still do it. My brother said that we’d just
  need a couple of weeks’ rehearsal and we could go on the road, no problem.”
  The band have faced backlash for performing in Israel in 2017. At the time,
  the band’s frontman, Thom Yorke, said: “Playing in a country isn’t the same as
  endorsing its government.” This criticism has intensified since October 2023.
  At a solo concert in Melbourne last October, Yorke was heckled by a man who
  asked him: “How could you be silent?” A flustered Yorke rebuffed him and
  briefly left the stage.
