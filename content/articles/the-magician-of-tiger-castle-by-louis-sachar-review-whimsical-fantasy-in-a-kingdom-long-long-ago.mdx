  The American author Louis Sachar’s most celebrated book, 1998’s YA novel
  Holes, was a huge word-of-mouth success on both sides of the Atlantic. Its
  short, punchy chapters tell the story of plump, hapless Stanley Yelnats, sent
  to a summer camp for wayward boys, where a terrifying Warden has peculiar
  ideas about character reformation. The 5ft-deep holes the boys are required to
  dig turn out to have a surprising purpose. Shifts of time, register and
  perspective render a simple premise mesmerisingly intricate. It has peril,
  love, crime, wickedness, redemption and friendship in, well, spades. A quarter
  of a century later, Sachar has written his first supposedly adult novel, in
  which many of the same ingredients reappear. A man “dressed like a typical
  American tourist”, but with an odd habit of storing cake crumbs in the pocket
  of his hoodie, has arrived at the castle of the title, filled with curiosity
  to see how much has changed in the past 500 years. He seems to know intimate
  details about daily life back then in the court of King Sandro, Queen Corinna
  and the headstrong teenage princess, Tullia. Anatole, the king’s bumbling
  magician and alchemist, was fast losing prestige due to his abject failure to
  turn black sand, brought in from Iceland at huge expense, into gold. But the
  magician evidently achieved one stunning success, for Anatole is our
  present-day narrator. Grisly legends have built up around the castle, as
  eagerly related by the tour guide, but are full of errors. Anatole decides to
  recount the real story. This former contemporary and rival of Leonardo da
  Vinci, now an immortal wanderer, explains how the near-bankrupt kingdom of
  Esquaveta depended for survival on a dynastic marriage between Princess Tullia
  and Prince Dalrympl of wealthy Oxatania; his betrothal gift of a tiger gave
  the castle its name. But Tullia loved Pito, a young scribe. Incensed, Dalrympl
  demanded that Pito be beheaded during the wedding feast. Anatole was tasked
  with ensuring the royal wedding went ahead and thus saving the realm. Timid
  and compromised, he brewed various bizarre concoctions supposed to inspire
  love and delete memories, but became embroiled in the lovers’ situation,
  especially after recognising Dalrympl as the swine who caused the death of
  Babette, his own sweetheart. The portrayal of science in the period is lightly
  comical but never patronising. Although he can’t conceive of a building block
  of matter any smaller than a grain of sand, Renaissance-era Anatole is almost
  on the point of discovering penicillin via his experiments with mouldy bread.
  In the present day he has centuries of scientific discovery to call upon; all
  the same, he muses, is the notion of the four humours any more fantastical a
  metaphor than the periodic table? Operating at the birth of modern science,
  Anatole had it both ways, creating effective medicines while also commanding
  respect as a controller of evil spirits. Despite a daring escape, pursuit and
  the threat of retribution, the air of whimsy throughout mitigates any sense of
  genuine peril (and we obviously know Anatole survives). Just as in Holes,
  Sachar knots plot threads together in unexpected and satisfying ways. There’s
  a dash of Patrick Süskind’s Perfume in Anatole’s experiments, but without that
  novel’s sombre heft. If the narration were given over to Tullia or Pito, this
  would be a standard YA novel; but then we’d be without the pleasures of
  Anatole’s long view and his gentle scepticism about love, war, human nature
  and politics. • The Magician of Tiger Castle by Louis Sachar is published by
  Mountain Leopard (£20). To support the Guardian order your copy at
