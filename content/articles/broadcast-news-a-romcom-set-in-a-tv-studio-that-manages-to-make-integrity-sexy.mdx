  “I am concerned about the garbage that is masquerading as television these
  days,” the legendary US news anchor Walter Cronkite declared in 1989. “Most of
  it is real scandal tabloid journalism … absolutely, totally useless stuff.”
  Two years earlier Broadcast News was writing this on the wall. The decline of
  journalistic standards isn’t a conventional backdrop for a romcom (His Girl
  Friday being another key exception) but it was a matter close to the heart of
  James L Brooks, who had come up through CBS as a news writer before his
  prolific TV career (via The Mary Tyler Moore Show and, later, The Simpsons).
  In the wake of the thunderous success of his film Terms of Endearment, Brooks
  returned to CBS for a period of rigorous research and latched on to the
  decorated news producer Susan Zirinsky – the main inspiration for his next
  film’s indomitable heroine. Taking place amid the crossed wires and tense
  deadlines of a Washington news bureau, Broadcast News’ love triangle converges
  on a news producer, Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a quintessential hypercompetent
  career woman with disastrous romantic instincts. Tom Grunick (William Hurt), a
  freshly imported anchor, is the handsome jackass who represents everything she
  hates – though maybe she can fix him. The lovelorn best friend/nice guy is
  Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks), a diligent but fatally untelegenic news reporter
  who longs for primetime recognition. Early on Jane gives a speech at a
  conference decrying the celebrity status of news anchors and the encroachment
  of “soft news”, which is summarily dismissed by her audience of industry
  colleagues. Tom lends the only sympathetic ear, acutely aware that – as a
  rising anchor who can sell the news better than he can understand it – he’s
  part of the problem. Their first romantic interaction is spectacularly
  fumbled. In Jane’s hotel room Tom is too concerned with assuaging his guilt to
  notice Jane’s advances. Jane has no interest in playing along, her contempt
  palpable. “What do you want from me, permission to be fake?” she snaps.
  There’s joy in watching intelligent, attractive people effortlessly trade
  barbs – “I can’t believe I just risked my life for a network that tests my
  face with focus groups” is a personal favourite – but the real strength of
  Brooks’ screenplay lies how each characters trip over their own dysfunctions.
  There’s an honesty to how Jane’s consummate professionalism comes at the
  expense of her personal life, and how Aaron’s underappreciated intelligence
  flips into resentment. Broadcast News manages to make integrity feel sexy.
  Hunter’s impassioned lead performance sells the near-unattainable fantasy of
  being helplessly in love with your own work. Her stubbornness comes not from a
  place of arrogance but of principle; someone has to care, especially as the
  tides begin to shift across the media – as heralded by Tom’s arrival in the
  bureau. Her personal impasse with Tom is only bridged when their professional
  commitments align: in one of the film’s most electric sequences, Jane – helped
  by Aaron – dictates Tom’s lines in his first live TV appearance, with the
  cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, uniting them in split diopter compositions.
  The film doesn’t play coy about the erotic implications of their synchronised
  performance, which Tom enthusiastically compares to great sex. These days the
  media landscape depicted in Broadcast News registers as a distant fantasy.
  There’s certainly a cosy analogue nostalgia to indulge in, particularly in the
  slapstick spectacle of watching Joan Cusack race across the bureau, VHS tape
  in hand, to make sure a news segment makes it to air on time. As Brooks maps
  the early descent of broadcast journalism into lowest-common-denominator
  content and the gutting of media organisations, it’s hard not to feel as
  though you’re watching a horror movie, screaming at the teens not to go into
  the basement. But Broadcast News is far from cynical. In her steadfast refusal
  to be separated from her principles, Jane Craig continues to endure, reminding
  us that, in every aspect of our lives, there are boundaries that can never be
  crossed. Broadcast News is available to stream on Disney+ in Australia and to
  rent in the US and UK. For more recommendations of what to stream in
