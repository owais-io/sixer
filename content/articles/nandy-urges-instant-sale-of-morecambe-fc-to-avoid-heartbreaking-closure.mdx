  The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has called for the immediate sale of
  Morecambe football club to avoid the “heartbreaking” closure of the
  105-year-old institution within days. Shareholders at the National League club
  said it would “officially shut” and face “total collapse” on Monday unless the
  owner, Jason Whittingham, agreed to sell up. In a statement, the prospective
  buyers, Panjab Warriors, and minority shareholders said the club had “£0 in
  the bank and no cash on site [meaning] operations cannot continue”. The
  collapse of the club, known as the Shrimps, has added urgency to plans for a
  new football regulator after similar crises at historic clubs including Bury
  FC, Macclesfield, Sheffield Wednesday and Bolton Wanderers. In an open letter
  to Whittingham on Friday, Nandy said: “I am writing to you to express my deep
  concern at the serious and worsening situation at Morecambe football club.
  “The uncertainty and misery now facing this proud club, its fans, players,
  staff and the local community is heartbreaking to see.” The club’s future has
  hung in the balance since Whittingham, an Essex businessman, appeared to
  renege on a deal with Panjab Warriors, a London-based investment firm, and was
  planning to sell instead to a mystery third party. Weeks of delay led to the
  club being suspended until at least 20 August by the National League, the
  fifth tier of English football, meaning it cannot play its opening three
  fixtures, which are due to kick off next Saturday. Nandy urged Whittingham to
  end the “agony” of fans as quickly as possible. “It is the government’s firm
  view that owners need to act as the custodians of their clubs,” she wrote. “It
  is never too late to do the right thing and with so much at stake for this
  grand old town, the time for action is now. I call on you to effect a sale to
  a suitable owner, and give the club a chance of a brighter future.” Lizzi
  Collinge, the Labour MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said she was “devastated
  that this crisis is still dragging on, with the damage being done worsening
  every day”. Collinge called on Whittingham to “just sign the damn paperwork”
  and said the crisis would have been “entirely avoidable” if he had sold the
  club when the English Football League approved the deal in early June. She
  said she was frustrated that the new football regulator, which will start work
  later this year, would not be able to save Morecambe, but said it would stop
  other clubs “suffering in the future by preventing rogue ownership”. Pat
  Stoyles, the interim chair of the Morecambe supporters’ group, the Shrimps
  Trust, said it was “absolutely devastating” to face losing the club. All
  junior-level operations at the club ended on Friday due to a lack of
  insurance, bringing an end to “every kid’s dream of playing for their local
  club”, said Stoyles. He said: “I dont think people thought it would affect
  every level of football through the club. We are going to effectively lose
  everything.” He said there was “anger and frustration” at Whittingham, but
  added: “As time goes on that anger starts to spread into the governing bodies
  for allowing it to get to this situation and not learning from experiences
  like Bury and Macclesfield.” The Guardian has contacted the club and
  Whittingham for comment.
