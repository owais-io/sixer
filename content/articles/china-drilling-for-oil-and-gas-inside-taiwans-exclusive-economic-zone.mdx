  China is drilling for oil and gas inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone
  (EEZ), a move that analysts believe is likely part of Beijing’s unilateral
  grab for disputed territory that could also aid a future invasion of Taiwan.
  During July and August at least 12 oil and gas vessels and permanent
  structures were detected inside Taiwan’s EEZ – including one within 50km of
  the restricted-waters border of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands – as well
  as several steel supports for fixed offshore drilling platforms, called
  jackets. Their presence inside Taiwan’s EEZ have not been previously reported.
  Experts said the activity fit the pattern of Beijing’s “greyzone” strategies
  for seizing disputed territory. Beijing claims the entirety of the South China
  Sea, despite The Hague ruling the claim unlawful in 2016. Beijing also claims
  Taiwan is a province of China, and in preparation to forcibly annexe it has
  ramped up a campaign of “salami slicing” Taiwan’s territory, forcibly
  shrinking the space that Taipei can control and defend. “China’s greyzone
  aggression routinely leverages commercial activity for expansionist goals,”
  said Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at
  Stanford University. The presence of Chinese vessels and structures in the EEZ
  was first identified in research published on Tuesday by US thinktank the
  Jamestown Foundation, which said they were owned by the state-run China
  National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). However, there is no sign of the
  Taiwan government having responded to it, despite frequently enforcing its EEZ
  elsewhere. The apparent lack of response has surprised analysts. “Failure to
  protest today risks normalising sovereignty shaving and encourages further
  encroachment,” the Jamestown report warned. The assets are large – including
  at least one vessel measuring more than 240m long with decks equivalent to 1.5
  football fields, and two of the largest wellhead platforms in Asia. The report
  found some had been there for at least five years, with one coming within a
  kilometre of the Pratas restricted-waters border in 2024. The Guardian has
  independently located most of the assets using civilian maritime tracking
  websites. Challenging the oil and gas activity in Taiwan’s EEZ would be
  difficult. Taiwan’s political status meant it is not party to the UN
  convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) or its arbitration mechanisms.
  Domestic law about which parts of the EEZ border Taiwan enforces is unclear
  and it does not have the maritime strength to challenge such activity. “My
  guess is that Taipei lacked capabilities to respond, and that explains why
  they didn’t,” said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific
  program at the US-based German Marshall Fund. “Perhaps they underestimated how
  extensive it would be.” CNOOC describes itself as “one of the largest
  independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the world”. It
  engages in numerous joint ventures with foreign firms, including with Taiwan’s
  CPC, although Taiwan’s ministry said there are currently no active contracts.
  But as a state-owned firm, it also works in the interests of Beijing’s
  political ambitions. In 2012, CNOOC’s chair, Wang Yilin, said in a speech:
  “Large-scale deep-water rigs are our mobile national territory and a strategic
  weapon,” according to the Wall Street Journal. CNOOC was approached for
  comment. Prof Zhu Feng, from the Tsinghua University’s centre for
  international security and strategy, said China’s oil and gas exploration was
  “primarily driven by its current energy needs” and was not intended to further
  escalate territorial disputes. “Rather it reflects China’s strong stance in
  safeguarding its claimed rights and interests in the region,” Zhu told the
  Guardian. Such activity has previously drawn the ire of other governments.
  This week Japan’s government accused Beijing of positioning 21 drilling rigs
  inside the Japanese EEZ, in an alleged “unilateral” effort to develop gas
  fields in disputed waters of the East China Sea and potentially extract gas
  from the Japanese side. The Jamestown report warned that structures like the
  jackets also had potential for dual use by China’s military, and “could
  facilitate a full range of coercion, blockade, bombardment and/or invasion
  scenarios against Pratas or Taiwan more generally”. In the five years since
  these assets were first moved into the EEZ, Beijing has ramped up a campaign
  to weaken Taiwan’s control over its territorial space, with military drills
  and incursions, and coast guard patrols in the restricted waters around
  Taiwan’s offshore islands. “China has been steadily overwhelming Taiwan’s
  defences with aggressions much nearer their shores, which may make this
  something they’d simply rather not have to deal with,” Powell said. “Often
  governments don’t publicly respond to aggressions if they think making such
  complaints would beg the question of what else they can do about it.” The
  Guardian contacted Taiwan’s national security council for comment. It also
  contacted the ministry of economic affairs, which referred most questions to
  Taiwan’s ocean affairs council. The council declined to comment. Taiwan’s
  coast guard said it “maintains continuous monitoring of maritime targets
  within its surveillance area” but that oil drilling exploration and
  cooperations were outside its remit. China’s ministry of foreign affairs did
  not respond to a faxed request for comment. Additional research by Lillian
