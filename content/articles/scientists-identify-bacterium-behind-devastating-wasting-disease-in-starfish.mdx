  A decade after the onset of a sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic
  considered the largest ever documented in the wild, researchers have
  identified the microbial culprit responsible: a strain of the bacterium Vibrio
  pectenicida. In 10 years, the bacterium has ravaged sunflower sea stars
  (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a large sea star or starfish, along the western
  coast of North America, with a loss of 5.8 billion since 2013 – or 90% of the
  total global population. The sunflower sea star is on the International Union
  for Conservation of Nature’s red list of critically endangered species.
  Previous studies had tested for a pathogen in tissue samples and yielded
  inconclusive results. Instead, by examining the sea stars’ coelomic fluid,
  which acts like blood, researchers were able to confirm with certainty V
  pectenicida’s role in causing SSWD due to its high abundance there. Infection
  with the V pectenicida strain FHCF-3 begins with exterior lesions, leading to
  limb loss and contortion, and ultimately kills afflicted individuals by
  melting their tissues into a white, mucus-like paste. Identifying the disease
  in afflicted sea stars was impossible without a known pathogen, as sea stars
  can respond with similar visual signals to other stressors such as low oxygen,
  salinity variation and extreme heat. The indirect link between rising ocean
  temperatures and SSWD remains a key area of interest, since Vibrio species are
  known to proliferate in warm water during seasonal variations and anomalous
  marine heating events. The research, published this week in the journal Nature
  Ecology &amp; Evolution, was led by Dr Melanie Prentice and Dr Alyssa Gehman,
  of the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, as part of a four-year
  international collaboration involving the University of British Columbia, the
  University of Washington and the Nature Conservancy, among other parties. The
  decline of sunflower sea stars has ramifications for marine ecosystems beyond
  the loss of a single species. “Identifying the cause of SSWD is incredibly
  impactful,” Prentice said. “In the absence of sunflower stars, [kelp-eating]
  sea urchin populations increase, which means the loss of kelp forests, and
  that has broad implications for all the other marine species and humans that
  rely on them.” Kelp forests provide a habitat for thousands of marine
  creatures, support local economies through fisheries and recreation, and are
  culturally important for First Nations and tribal communities. They also
  stabilise sediments, protect coastlines from storms, and are an important
  carbon sink for sequestering carbon dioxide. Though the epidemic is still
  ongoing, the hope is that this breakthrough will aid recovery and treatment
  efforts for various sea star species across the world and the ecosystems
  affected by their decline. Methods being explored include captive breeding for
  resistant individuals and developing probiotic solutions that can be
  introduced to ecosystems. “Now that we have found the causative agent of
  disease, it makes me hopeful that we might actually be able to do something
  for sunflower sea stars,” says Gehman. “We can be really targeted in how we
  work with them, and I think that’s going to help us move a lot faster and to
  try to tackle SSWD.” • This article was amended on 6 August 2025. Previous
  studies had tested for pathogens in tissue samples, not for V pectenicida
  specifically as an earlier version said. And a mention of V pectenicida
  proliferating in warm water during seasonal variations has been amended to
  refer to Vibrio species in general instead.
