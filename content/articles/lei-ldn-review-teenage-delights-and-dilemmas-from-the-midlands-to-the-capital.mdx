  LEI-LDN review – teenage delights and dilemmas, from the Midlands to the
  capital

  Chardaye Brown is a 17-year-old Leicester girl who has just been kicked out of
  home. And all because she defended herself against a racist classmate. She’s
  being shipped off by her white mum, Claire, to her Jamaican aunt Jemima in
  Peckham, south London, leaving her best friend behind. Can the force of her
  teenage bravado, the shield of her phone and the comfort of her favourite
  musicians steer her through the move? Written and performed by Na-keisha
  Pebody, LEI-LDN explores growing up mixed race, and how that experience shifts
  as Chardaye relocates from the Midlands to the capital, mirroring Pebody’s own
  journey. In a suburb of Leicester, at a white-majority school, with a mum who
  had no idea how to care for her hair, she felt adrift. But being Black in
  Peckham: “I finally felt like I was with my people.” That is, until she faces
  tests she didn’t even know she was taking, measures of whether she’s Black
  enough. It feels like you have to pick a side, Chardaye says: “If you don’t
  pick, they pick for you.” It’s a personality-driven hour, and Pebody’s
  performance captures the roiling uncertainty of being a teenager – from the
  anxiety of starting a new school or fitting in with new friends, to the
  delights of dancing, gossiping and flirting. Directed by Mya Onwugbonu, the
  show’s music (from Bob Marley to bashment to Nicki Minaj) and bites of
  audience interaction (helping Chardaye pick an outfit, pack a suitcase or do a
  group dance) build a sense of confidence and fun in the room. We change pace
  as Chardaye learns about the history of dual-heritage children in the UK,
  seeing herself in their experiences, summoning sympathy for Claire, and giving
  Pebody the chance to deliver a more sombre monologue. It’s a sweet tale of
  self-actualisation and, if you’re game, you’ll end the show dancing, too. • At
  Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival
