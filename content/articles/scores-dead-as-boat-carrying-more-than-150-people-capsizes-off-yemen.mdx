  A boat has capsized off Yemen’s coast leaving 76 people dead and 74 others
  missing, the UN’s migration agency said. Yemeni security officials said 76
  bodies had been recovered and 32 people rescued from the shipwreck in the Gulf
  of Aden in what a senior official from the International Organization for
  Migration (IOM) described as “one of the deadliest” shipwrecks off Yemen this
  year. The UN migration agency said 157 people were onboard. The IOM’s Yemen
  head, Abdusattor Esoev, said the boat had been on a dangerous route often used
  by people-smugglers and was heading to Abyan governorate in southern Yemen, a
  frequent destination for boats smuggling African people hoping to reach the
  wealthy Gulf states. Some of those rescued have been transferred to the Yemeni
  port of Aden, near Abyan, a security official said. Despite the civil war that
  has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a popular
  transit point for irregular migration, in particular from Ethiopia, which
  itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy
  See’s secretary of state, said the pope was “deeply saddened by the
  devastating loss of life”. Each year, thousands of people brave the so-called
  “eastern route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of
  eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the
  United Arab Emirates. The IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea
  route last year, 462 of them from boat accidents. Ayla Bonfiglio of the Mixed
  Migration Centre research and policy organisation told Agence France-Presse:
  “This route is predominantly controlled by smugglers and human-trafficking
  networks … Refugees and migrants have no other alternative but to hire their
  services. “Migrants are well aware of the risks, but with no legal pathways
  and families relying on remittances from Saudi Arabia or the Emirates, many
  feel they have no choice.” At least eight people died after smugglers forced
  150 people off a boat in the Red Sea in June, according to the IOM. Yemeni
  security forces were recovering a “significant” number of bodies, the Abyan
  directorate said on Sunday. On their way to the Gulf, migrants cross the Bab
  al-Mandab strait, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Red Sea that is a
  popular route for international trade, as well as for migration and human
  trafficking. Once in Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, migrants
  often face other threats to their safety. The IOM says tens of thousands of
  migrants had become stranded in Yemen and suffered abuse and exploitation
  during their journeys. In April, more than 60 people were killed in a strike
  blamed on the US that hit a migrant detention centre in Yemen, according to
  the Houthi rebels who control much of the country. The wealthy Gulf monarchies
  host significant populations of foreign workers from south Asia and Africa.
  The Abyan security directorate described a huge search-and-rescue operation
  given the large number of dead and missing people. Its statement said many
  dead bodies were found scattered across a wide area of the shore.
