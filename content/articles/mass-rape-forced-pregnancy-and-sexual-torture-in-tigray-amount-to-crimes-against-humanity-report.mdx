  Hundreds of health workers across Tigray have documented mass rape, sexual
  slavery, forced pregnancy and sexual torture of women and children by
  Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers, in systematic attacks that amount to crimes
  against humanity, a new report has found. The research, compiled by Physicians
  for Human Rights and the Organization for Justice and Accountability in the
  Horn of Africa (OJAH), represents the most comprehensive documentation yet of
  weaponised sexual violence in Tigray. It reviewed medical records of more than
  500 patients, surveys of 600 health workers, and in-depth interviews with
  doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and community leaders. The authors outline
  evidence of systematic attacks designed to destroy the fertility of Tigrayan
  women and call for international bodies to investigate the crime of genocide.
  The attacks described by healthcare workers are extreme in their brutality,
  often leaving survivors with severe, long-term injuries. “Having worked on
  gender-based violence for two decades … this is not something I have ever seen
  in other conflicts,” said Payal Shah, a human rights lawyer and co-author of
  the report. “It is a really horrific and extreme form of sexual violence, and
  one that deserves the world’s attention.” Survivors treated by health
  professionals ranged from infants to elderly people. The youngest was less
  than a year old. More than 20% of health workers said those they treated for
  sexual violence included very young children (1-12 years); and 63% treated
  children under the age of 17. Dr Abraha Gebreegziabher, chief clinical
  director of Ayder hospital in Tigray, told the Guardian his hospital treated
  thousands of rape survivors, at times admitting more than 100 a week. “Some
  [trends] stand out during the war,” he said. “One is gang raping. Second is
  the insertion of foreign bodies, including messages and broken rocks or stones
  … Then, the intentional spread of infection, HIV particularly,” he said. “I am
  convinced, and see strong evidence, that rape was used as a weapon of war.” In
  June, the Guardian revealed a pattern of extreme sexual violence where
  soldiers forced foreign objects – including metal screws, stones and other
  debris – into women’s reproductive organs. In at least two cases, the soldiers
  inserted plastic-wrapped letters detailing their intent to destroy Tigrayan
  women’s ability to give birth. The new research included interviews with a
  number of healthcare workers who independently reported treating victims of
  this kind of attack. Many of the survivors said soldiers expressed their
  desire to exterminate the Tigrayan ethnicity – either by destroying Tigrayan
  women’s reproductive organs, or forcing them to give birth to children of the
  rapist’s ethnicity. One psychologist who treated a teenage girl said: “Her arm
  was broken and became paralysed when the perpetrators tried to remove the
  Norplant contraceptive method inserted in her upper arm, and this was aimed to
  force pregnancy from the perpetrator. [They said]: ‘You will give birth from
  us, then the Tigrayan ethnic[ity] will be wiped out eventually.’” Other women
  were held at military camps, some for months or years, and gave birth to the
  children of their assailants while in captivity. Legal analysis of the medical
  record data and health worker testimony found conclusive evidence of crimes
  against humanity, including mass rape, forced pregnancy, and enforced
  sterilisation, Shah said. Women were frequently assaulted in public, by
  multiple attackers, and in front of family. The attacks included significant
  breaches of taboo in Tigray, including anal rape and attacks on menstruating
  women. The resulting stigma meant that some survivors were divorced by their
  husbands, rejected by families, or socially excluded. “This form of violence
  is being imparted in a way that is intended to cause trauma, humiliation,
  suffering and fracture and break communities,” Shah said. “This is going to
  have generational impacts.” Many survivors are still living in displaced
  persons’ camps. A number of clinics providing for survivors have shut due to
  the closure of USAID. “The very fabric of these women’s personalities and
  sense of self has been shattered,” one psychiatrist said. A significant
  portion of health workers had treated children. Many were too young to
  understand what had happened, one nurse said: “Most of them don’t know what
  rape is. They do not know what the consequence is.” For girls who became
  pregnant, some as young as 12, the health risks were significant. “Their
  bodies are not fully developed to handle the demands of pregnancy,” a
  reproductive health coordinator working with child survivors said. Ayder
  hospital treated a number of children, Abraha said, many of whom developed
  long-term conditions, including fistula. As well as direct victims of sexual
  attacks, health professionals described treating children who had experienced
  “forced witnessing”, where they were made to watch parents and siblings being
  raped or killed, causing severe psychological trauma. Health workers in Tigray
  face significant risk for speaking publicly about sexual violence by
  government-affiliated forces. One surgical worker, who spoke on condition of
  anonymity, told the Guardian that the youngest patient he had treated for
  sexual attacks was three years old. “It is very difficult to think of the
  worst [cases],” he said. At Ayder hospital, Abraha said medical staff
  experienced acute psychological distress and nightmares as a result of what
  they had witnessed. “We hope that many people will hear [about this] across
  the surface of the Earth. If justice can be served, maybe consolation will
  follow.” The report covered the conflict and post-conflict period to 2024, and
  concluded that weaponised sexual violence has continued since the ceasefire,
  and expanded to new regions. “The perpetrators must be punished, and the
  situation must be resolved,” one health worker said. “True healing requires
  justice.” Anbassa*, a human rights worker in Ethiopia who helped conduct the
  surveys, said: “No one is accountable.” The failure to hold perpetrators to
  account meant human rights abuses continued, he said, with atrocities now
  being committed in the nearby regions of Amhara and Afar. “If this conflict
  continues, this impunity that happened in Tigray, the aftermath of this one
  will continue, [and] conflicts are going to erupt to other regions.” * Name
