  Elton John and Spin̈al Tap have joined forces on a new version of the band’s
  song Stonehenge – and have finally corrected one of the great scenery-based
  mishaps in classic rock. The song, performed in the 1984 rock-mockumentary
  This Is Spin̈al Tap, is at the heart of one of the film’s most cherished
  scenes: when the band, having made a mistake when commissioning an 18ft
  Stonehenge stage prop, have to make do with an 18in version being lowered from
  the rafters. After some hired dwarves caper around it, the band’s David St
  Hubbins complains that they looked likely to crush it underfoot. No such
  problems with the new version made for the long-awaited sequel Spın̈al Tap II:
  The End Continues, which will be released 12 September in the US and UK (and
  25 September in Australia). In the scene, released today along with a
  recording of the song on streaming services, the band put in a considerably
  more triumphant performance, complete with full-sized standing stones and the
  return of the dwarves. Appearing in a cloak from beneath the stage is Elton
  John, who takes over the lead vocal, singing lyrics such as “Stonehenge, where
  a man’s a man / and the children dance to the pipes of Pan” with the requisite
  po-faced grandeur. John is one of a number of starry cameos in the film, along
  with Paul McCartney, Questlove, Metallica’s Lars Ulrich and more. Michael
  McKean reprises his role as St Hubbins alongside Christopher Guest as Nigel
  Tufnel and Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls, heading up a supporting cast filled
  with British comedy stars such as Nina Conti, Chris Addison and Kerry
  Godliman. The film will have the documentary film-maker Marty DiBergi (played
  by Rob Reiner) following the group as they prepare for a final reunion show.
  The first trailer was released earlier this week. An accompanying soundtrack
  album has also been announced. Elton John will appear again on Flower People,
  while McCartney joins them for Cups and Cakes, and country music couple Garth
  Brooks and Trisha Yearwood perform Big Bottom.
