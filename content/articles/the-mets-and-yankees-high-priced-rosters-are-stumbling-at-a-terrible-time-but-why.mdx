  The New York Mets and New York Yankees will have disbursed nearly $640m in
  player salaries by the end of the 2025 season, but money hasn’t bought
  happiness for either New York City fanbase. After enjoying hot starts to begin
  the 2025 season, the Yankees are now in third place in the American League
  East while the Mets are a woeful 11-16 since the All-Star Break and 4-11 in
  the month of August. Even though both teams would qualify for the postseason
  if the season ended today, neither of them are meeting their lofty preseason
  expectations. With under 40 games remaining in the season, what is ailing the
  teams that enjoyed comfortable first-place leads earlier this season? And is
  all hope lost as they enter the last quarter of the season? The Mets When the
  Mets signed Juan Soto to a record-setting 15-year, $765m contract in December,
  they lured the superstar away from the wealthy crosstown rival Yankees and
  inherited the weighty expectations that come with a historic signing. When
  Soto started (relatively) slowly over the first two months of the season, the
  Mets covered for him with some of the best pitching in baseball (a 2.88 ERA
  through 31 May) and a strong offensive season from first baseman Pete Alonso.
  When Soto found his usual form in June, the Mets started faltering. Since the
  start of June, Soto has hit 21 home runs and posted a .408 on-base percentage,
  but the Mets are a dreary 28-36 in that same time span. The month of August
  has been an ongoing nightmare for their pitching staff: the starting pitching
  that anchored the team to start the season has a ghastly 6.22 ERA in August,
  which has taxed a tired bullpen that added two major pieces (Ryan Helsley,
  Tyler Rogers) at the trade deadline in July. The Mets’ bullpen is responsible
  for eight of the team’s eleven losses in August. Helsley, a two-time All-Star
  who led the National League in saves last year with the St Louis Cardinals,
  was brought in to set up All-Star closer Edwin Díaz. Unfortunately, Helsley
  has stumbled to a 7.11 ERA in his first eight games with his new team. It’s an
  uncharacteristically bad stretch for one of baseball’s most dominant relief
  pitchers, and the Mets need him to find his usual form if they want to compete
  in a loaded National League playoff race. Even with their horrendous run of
  recent form, the Mets remain one of the most talented teams in baseball and a
  viable pennant contender. Shortstop Francisco Lindor – who finished second to
  Shohei Ohtani in last year’s NL MVP race – is one of the game’s most admired
  leaders and consistent producers. Even after battling through two major slumps
  earlier in the season, Lindor has already hit 20 home runs and stolen 20 bases
  for the fifth time in his career. If the Mets want to make their playoffs,
  they’ll need to play like a postseason team until the end of September. Of
  their final 38 games, 22 of them will be against teams in the thick of a
  playoff race (including seven against the division-leading Phillies). For a
  team that was 21 games over .500 in the middle of June, it would be nothing
  short of an epic collapse if the Mets were somehow left home in October. The
  Yankees The Yankees won their first American League pennant in 15 years last
  season, but their World Series loss to the Dodgers was a bitter end marred by
  terrible defense and poor hitting in clutch situations. This year’s team has
  better balance than the 2024 version – they added top starting pitcher Max
  Fried, former MVP Cody Bellinger and two-time All-Star relief pitcher Devin
  Williams after losing Soto to the Mets – but the Yankees still suffer from
  inconsistent relief pitching and sloppy defense. Aaron Judge is a good bet to
  win his third MVP award in four years – he leads baseball in batting average,
  on-base percentage, slugging percentage and times on base – and infielder Jazz
  Chisholm Jr is, like Lindor, one of eight players this season to hit at least
  20 home runs and steal at least 20 bases. By the end of the season, shortstop
  Anthony Volpe might join them as a member of the 20-20 club. The offense
  hasn’t been the problem: it has the highest slugging percentage (.430) and
  more home runs than any team in baseball (195). A lineup featuring Judge,
  Bellinger (22 home runs this year) Giancarlo Stanton (441 career home runs)
  will terrify any opposing pitcher. The problem is the pitching staff. Since
  the All-Star Break, the Yankees have the worst ERA (4.70) of any team
  competing for a playoff spot and have walked more hitters (110) than any team
  in baseball in that span. Like the Mets, the Yankees traded for two former
  All-Star relief pitchers (David Bednar and Camilo Doval), to try to stabilize
  the struggling staff and push the team into the postseason. While Bednar has
  adapted nicely (a 2.16 ERA and three saves), Doval has labored to a 6.43 ERA
  with six walks in eight appearances. General manager Brian Cashman likely
  envisioned Doval, Bednar, former closer Luke Weaver and Williams vanquishing
  hitters in the late innings. Instead, the team is experimenting with different
  roles while trying to fix what is ailing Williams. After three consecutive
  seasons with a sub-2.00 ERA in Milwaukee, Williams has endured a nightmare
  opening season in the Bronx, which has seen him lose the closer job before
  regaining it, only to lose it again after surrendering runs in five
  consecutive outings over July and August. In 140 innings pitched from
  2022-2024, Williams allowed 26 total earned runs and seven home runs. In 47
  1/3 innings this season, he has allowed 28 earned runs and five homers.
  Whether his issues are mechanical or psychological, Williams has not been the
  pitcher that the Yankees thought they were acquiring this offseason. And then
  there is the defense. Since their notoriously bad performance in Game 5 of the
  2024 World Series, the Yankees’ defense is more scrutinized than any other
  team in baseball. They might not be as bad as some people say – Volpe is a
  Gold Glove-quality shortstop, Paul Goldschmidt remains a reliable first
  baseman and Bellinger is one of baseball’s best defensive outfielders – but
  some embarrassing blunders have kept that conversation alive. Ultimately, it
  isn’t a trustworthy unit. The Yankees offense is so good, though, that it’s
  unlikely they’ll miss the playoffs. The American League is a much weaker
  overall group than the National League this season, which means the Yankees
  may very well find their way to a second consecutive pennant. But they’ll need
  to shore up their pitching and defense if they expect to return to the World
  Series.
