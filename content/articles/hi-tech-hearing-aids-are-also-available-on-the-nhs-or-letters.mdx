webTitle: ‘Hi-tech’ hearing aids are also available on the NHS | Letters

  The closing paragraphs of Lucy Knight’s article (‘I’m carrying survivor’s
  guilt’: Raymond Antrobus on growing up deaf, 9 August) may have left readers
  with a misleading impression of the services and quality of hearing aids
  provided by the NHS. “Hi-tech” hearing aids that connect to a smartphone are
  standard issue with the NHS. True, the very latest models of hearing aids may
  only be available privately (though, like smartphones, I suspect that the
  upgrades are often minimal). Like the private sector, the NHS provision of
  hearing aids is also regularly upgraded. The replacement hearing aids I got
  this January provide excellent sound, and are a conduit for all the radio and
  podcast listening I need. Not a bad service. Rob Voakes Bradford • Have an
