  King Charles led VJ Day commemorations in the UK as a national service of
  remembrance and two-minute silence marked the 80th anniversary of Japan’s
  surrender in the second world war and the end of the six-year-long conflict.
  He was joined by the queen, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and veterans who
  served in the far east theatres of war as wreaths were laid at the National
  Memorial Arboretum service in Staffordshire. Powerful testimonies read aloud
  reminded of the terrible cost of war, while a flypast featured the Red Arrows
  and historic second world war aircraft, including a Spitfire, Hurricane and
  Lancaster bomber. Guests of honour included 33 veterans aged from 96 to 105. A
  Royal Navy veteran, Alfred Conway, from Lincolnshire, watched as his great
  granddaughter laid a wreath on the Burma railway memorial at the arboretum.
  George Durrant, who served in the intelligence corps, appeared on stage to
  urge people not to forget the sacrifices made by his comrades. In Japan,
  Emperor Naruhito spoke of his “deep remorse” on the anniversary and said he
  felt “a deep and renewed sense of sorrow” in a sombre speech in an indoor
  arena in the centre of the Japanese capital. A visit by two cabinet ministers
  to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo angered countries that suffered Japanese
  military atrocities, particularly China and South Korea, AFP reported. The
  shrine, which the country’s Asian neighbours view as a symbol of Japan’s
  wartime aggression, honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese soldiers who perished
  since the late 19th century but also enshrines convicted war criminals.
  Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, a political moderate, sent a customary
  offering to Yasukuni, according to Kyodo news. No Japanese prime minister has
  visited the shrine since 2013, when a trip by then-premier Shinzo Abe sparked
  fury in Beijing and Seoul. China’s foreign ministry on Friday summoned the
  chief minister of Japan’s embassy in China, Yokochi Akira, to lodge solemn
  representations over Japanese politicians visiting the war shrine, according
  to a ministry statement, Reuters reported. In an audio message before the
  national service of remembrance to the nation, realms and Commonwealth,
  Charles spoke of allied prisoners of war “who endured years of brutal
  captivity: the starvation, disease and cruelty that tested the very limits of
  human endurance” and the “mental and physical scars” the war left on those who
  survived. He vowed the service and sacrifice of VJ Day heroes “shall never be
  forgotten”. In what is believed to be the most direct reference by a British
  monarch to the suffering in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after their atomic
  bombings, he said: “We should also pause to acknowledge that in the war’s
  final act, an immense price was paid by the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
  – a price we pray no nation need ever pay again.” More than 90,000 British
  troops were casualties in the war against Japan, and nearly 30,000 died
  according to the Royal British Legion, while more than 12,000 Britons were
  among the 190,000 Commonwealth troops held as prisoners of war by the
  Japanese. Of the Allied forces, the US suffered the greatest losses, with more
  than 100,000 killed in action. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, more than 200,000
  people were killed by the US bombs and in the months after succumbing to
  radiation sickness, the effects of burns and other serious injuries. Hundreds
  of buildings across the UK were due to be lit up on Friday evening to mark VJ
  Day 80, including Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, the Houses of
  Parliament, the Tower of London, Tower 42, the Shard, Blackpool Tower,
  Gateshead Millennium Bridge, Durham Cathedral, Cardiff Castle, the Cenotaph
  and the White Cliffs of Dover.
