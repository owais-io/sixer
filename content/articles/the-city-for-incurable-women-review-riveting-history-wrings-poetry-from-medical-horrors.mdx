  In 19th-century France, the Salpêtrière hospital was an institution for
  mentally ill women. Safe to say the definition of mental illness was not the
  same as it is today. Inmates could end up being committed for anything from
  promiscuity to poverty. It was here that Dr Jean-Martin Charcot developed his
  theory of hysteria, a word whose etymology goes back to the Greek word for
  uterus. Breaking with a long tradition of doctors who attributed erratic
  behaviour in women to a wandering womb, Charcot treated hysteria as a
  neurological disorder. He insisted men could be susceptible too. In that and
  other areas, Charcot was a medical pioneer, even if his use of hypnosis,
  photography and showmanship strike us as eccentric today. We no longer ask
  patients to perform their illness for a curious audience nor do we recognise
  his four stages of hysteria. That conditions in Victorian asylums were less
  than ideal and that women have had a raw deal due to the slow evolution of
  psychiatry hardly needs saying. What makes Helena McBurney’s script so
  riveting is the way it blends misogyny and mental illness into fluid
  theatrical poetry, blurring the line between medic and patient in a play that
  is half lecture, half nightmare. Dressed in silky off-white trousers and a top
  buttoned up the back like a designer straitjacket, actor Charlotte McBurney
  gives a high-precision performance that crackles with vulnerability, confusion
  and intelligence. Haunted by voices coming at her from all directions in Bella
  Kear’s swirling sound design, she morphs from sober narrator to pompous doctor
  to psychotic Salpêtrière resident in a troubling collage. In Christina
  Deinsberger’s production for Fish in a Dress, the actor is crisp, physical and
  speedy as she draws us from lucidity to feverishness and makes connections to
  the treatment of women across the centuries. • At the Pleasance Courtyard,
  Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
