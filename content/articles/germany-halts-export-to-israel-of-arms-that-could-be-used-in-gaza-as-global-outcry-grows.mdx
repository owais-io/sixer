  The German chancellor has indicated a significant shift in Berlin’s staunch
  support for Israel by stopping the export of military equipment that could be
  used in Gaza, as international partners condemned Israeli plans to take
  control of Gaza City. Friedrich Merz issued a sharply worded statement
  signalling the reversal after several weeks of openly criticising Israel’s
  “unclear” policy goals in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian disaster there
  but stopping short of concrete consequences in policy. The German leader said
  Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas and press for the release
  of Israeli hostages, which he stressed was Berlin’s “highest priority” along
  with “resolute negotiations on a ceasefire”. However, Merz said his government
  “believes that the even tougher military action in Gaza Strip decided on by
  the Israeli cabinet last night makes it increasingly difficult to see how
  these goals can be achieved. Under these circumstances the German government
  will until further notice not approve any exports of military equipment that
  could be used in the Gaza Strip.” Merz said his administration was “deeply
  worried about the continued suffering of the civilian population” in Gaza,
  adding: “With the planned offensive, the Israeli government bears even
  stronger responsibility than to date for their provisions.” Israel’s prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, criticised the move, claiming Germany was
  “rewarding Hamas terrorism by embargoing arms to Israel”. Germany’s
  announcement joined a chorus of condemnation from international leaders on
  Friday over Israel’s plans to expand its military offensive in Gaza. The UN
  secretary general, António Guterres, described the plan as a “dangerous
  escalation” and said it risked “deepening the already catastrophic
  consequences for millions of Palestinians”. The European Commission president,
  Ursula von der Leyen, called on Israel to back away from its plans, while the
  European Council president, António Costa, warned that the new offensive would
  have “consequences” for EU-Israel ties. “The Israeli government’s decision to
  further extend its military operation in Gaza must be reconsidered,” von der
  Leyen said on social media. “At the same time, there must be the release of
  all hostages, who are being held in inhumane conditions. And humanitarian aid
  must be given immediate and unhindered access to Gaza to deliver what is
  urgently needed on the ground. A ceasefire is needed now.” Costa, who heads
  the body representing the 27 EU states, said a new offensive would only
  further worsen conditions in Gaza. “Such a decision must have consequences for
  EU-Israel relations, to be assessed by the council,” he wrote on X. Spain’s
  foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, denounced the Israeli decision, saying
  it would “only cause more destruction and suffering”. The UK prime minister,
  Keir Starmer, said Israel’s decision was wrong and urged it to immediately
  reconsider. “This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or
  to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more
  bloodshed,” he said. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk,
  said Israel’s plan “must be immediately halted”, and Turkey urged the
  international community “to prevent the implementation of this decision”.
  After the devastating Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, Germany strongly
  boosted its arms exports to Israel. Its parliament said in June that export
  licences for military equipment to Israel worth €485m were granted between 7
  October 2023 and 13 May 2025. Germany has for decades maintained an unwavering
  security relationship with Israel and describes its defence as critical to its
  own Staatsräson – core to its national identity due to its responsibility for
  the Holocaust. This robust support meant Germany declined to back recent calls
  within the EU to impose sanctions on Israel for mass civilian deaths in Gaza,
  such as suspending an association agreement with highly favourable trade terms
  or shutting it out of big funding and exchange programmes such as Horizon and
  Erasmus. The EU has faced criticism for not taking action against Israel in
  the face of starvation and blockades of utilities and aid but has been
  bedevilled by splits within the bloc, with Germany, Hungary and Austria
  prioritising the support of Israel’s right to defend itself. In his statement
  on Friday, Merz reiterated that Israel must allow “full-scale access for aid
  deliveries, including UN organisations and other non-governmental
  institutions”, so as to “continue to fully and sustainably improve the
  humanitarian situation in Gaza”. He said Germany “urgently asks the Israeli
  government to undertake no further steps toward an annexation of the West
  Bank”. Public opinion in Germany has grown increasingly critical of Israel as
  horrific images of starving children and widespread civilian casualties emerge
  from Gaza. A poll in late July by the Forsa opinion research institute found
  that nearly three-quarters of respondents believed Berlin should apply more
  pressure on the Israeli government over the catastrophic humanitarian
  situation in the Gaza Strip. While support for this stance was strongest from
  the far-left Linke (94%) and Greens (88%), most voters for the governing
  parties, Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD),
  shared the view, with 77% each. Adis Ahmetović, the foreign policy
  spokesperson of the SPD’s parliamentary group, welcomed Merz’s announcement on
  Friday but told Der Spiegel that the suspension of arms deliveries “can only
  be one step – more need to follow”, including a possible suspension of
  Israel’s trade status with the EU.
