  Ministers have asked China to send them the unredacted designs for its
  proposed “super-embassy” in London or justify why some of the drawings have
  been blacked out. In a letter on Wednesday Angela Rayner, the housing
  secretary and deputy prime minister, gave the Chinese embassy two weeks to
  send additional details about its plans before a crunch decision over whether
  to approve them. The government must deliver a verdict on the proposed
  super-embassy, which would occupy a sprawling 20,000 sq metres at Royal Mint
  Court in east London, by 9 September. If approved it would be the biggest
  embassy in Europe. The controversial plan has met fierce opposition from local
  residents and campaigners concerned about Beijing’s human rights record in
  Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Several large protests have taken place outside the
  site in recent months. In her letter, Rayner noted that two of the proposed
  embassy buildings on the drawings – the Cultural Exchange Building and Embassy
  House – had been “greyed out”. She wrote to the planning consultancy in charge
  of the Chinese embassy proposal asking it to “identify precisely and
  comprehensively” the drawings that had been redacted and explain the rationale
  and justification for these redactions. She asked the embassy to “consider
  whether to provide unredacted versions” of the drawings and questioned whether
  the redactions might infringe on the principle that the public must know what
  planning permission is granted for. The letter also noted that the Home Office
  and Foreign Office had requested the construction of a “hard perimeter” around
  the embassy site to address public safety concerns and that this could
  represent “a material amendment to the application that would require further
  consultation”. A lawyer for the Chinese embassy told the planning inquiry into
  the proposal earlier this year that China had no intention of altering the
  design. In her letter, Rayner asked for further details on how the embassy
  intended to address the government’s safety concerns. Luke de Pulford,
  executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which is a
  long-standing critic of the plans, said: “We have gone from the mega-embassy
  feeling like a done deal to Beijing having a mountain to climb to secure it.
  “The only way this development now gets approved is if the foreign and home
  secretaries roll over on their very modest conditions. They must stand firm,
  and we must finally put this disastrous plan to bed.” China bought the old
  Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there
  stalled after Tower Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022,
  citing security concerns and opposition from residents. The Conservative
  government declined to intervene but Labour took the matter out of the
  council’s hands by calling it in soon after taking power last summer. The
  future of the embassy has become a major issue in diplomatic relations between
  the UK and China, with the country’s president, Xi Jinping, raising it with
  Keir Starmer in their first phone call last August. The Guardian reported last
  year that China was blocking requests to rebuild the British embassy in
  Beijing while the fate of its own embassy in London was being decided. The
  Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government declined to comment on a
  live planning issue.
