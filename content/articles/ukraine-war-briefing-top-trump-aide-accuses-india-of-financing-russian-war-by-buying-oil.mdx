  buying oil

  A top aide to President Donald Trump has accused India of financing Russia’s
  war in Ukraine by buying oil from Moscow, after the US leader escalated
  pressure on Delhi to stop buying Russian oil. “What he [Trump] said very
  clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war
  by purchasing the oil from Russia,” said Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff
  at the White House and one of the US president’s most influential aides.
  Miller’s criticism on Sunday was some of the strongest yet by the Trump
  administration about one of the US’s major partners in the Indo-Pacific.
  “People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in
  purchasing Russian oil. That’s an astonishing fact,” Miller said on Fox News’
  Sunday Morning Futures. Indian government sources were quoted by various media
  on Saturday saying Delhi would keep purchasing oil from Moscow despite US
  threats. Trump on Sunday said special envoy Steve Witkoff may travel to Russia
  on Wednesday or Thursday, as he warned that he would impose sanctions if
  Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire in the Ukraine war before Friday.
  “There’ll be sanctions, but they seem to be pretty good at avoiding
  sanctions,” Trump told reporters. “They’re wily characters and they’re pretty
  good at avoiding sanctions, so we’ll see what happens.” A power line was
  damaged and a fire sparked at a railway station building in Russia’s southern
  region of Volgograd from an overnight Ukrainian drone attack, the regional
  administration said on Monday. An unexploded drone fell on railway tracks near
  the Archeda train station, it said on Telegram, citing regional governor
  Andrei Bocharov. No damage to the tracks was reported. A blaze at a Russian
  oil depot in Sochi in southern Russia caused by a Ukrainian drone attack was
  extinguished on Sunday, local authorities said. Veniamin Kondratyev, the
  governor of the surrounding Krasnodar region, said more than 120 firefighters
  were deployed. The overnight attack on the Ilsky refinery near the city of
  Krasnodar had set two oil tanks on fire. The Ukrainian air force said on
  Sunday that Russia had launched 76 drones and seven missiles against Ukraine
  overnight. It said it destroyed 60 drones and one missile but 16 others and
  six missiles hit targets across eight locations. The Russian defence ministry
  said its air units intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, including one
  over the Krasnodar region and 60 over the Black Sea. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said
  on Sunday that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to exchange 1,200 prisoners after
  their latest round of talks in Istanbul in July. “There is an agreement to
  exchange 1,200 people,” the Ukrainian president wrote on X, saying the lists
  of individuals to be swapped was still being determined to “unblock the return
  of our civilians”. “Preparations for a new meeting” were also under way,
  Zelenskyy said. A Russian attack killed three people in south-eastern
  Zaporizhzhia region on Sunday, the regional governor said. Governor Ivan
  Fedorov, writing on Telegram, said the three were killed in the daytime strike
  on the town of Stepnohirsk. Private homes were destroyed. The report could not
  be independently confirmed. The Russian and Chinese navies are carrying out
  artillery and anti-submarine drills in the Sea of Japan as part of scheduled
  joint exercises, the Russian Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying on Sunday. The
  drills are taking place two days after Donald Trump said he had ordered two
  nuclear submarines to be positioned in “the appropriate regions” in response
  to remarks by former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. However, they were
  scheduled well before Trump’s action.
