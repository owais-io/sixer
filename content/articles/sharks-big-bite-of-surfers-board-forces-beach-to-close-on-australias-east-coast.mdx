  A shark that bit a large chunk out of a surfer’s board on Monday has forced
  the temporary closure of a New South Wales beach and prompted surfing legend
  Kelly Slater to describe the man’s injury-free escape as “incredible”. The
  Tweed Shire council confirmed Cabarita beach, located about 35km north of
  Byron Bay, was currently closed. They said no one was injured in the incident.
  The council’s Facebook page noted that “fortunately, the bite missed the
  rider”. Photos posted online show the surfer on the beach with a large,
  bite-shaped mark missing from his board, which was also snapped in half. Video
  footage taken from a local beach cam shows a commotion in the water just
  before 7.30am. The eleven-time world surf champion Slater expressed relief and
  fear, after seeing photographs of the bite. “Incredible he’s ok,” Slater
  posted on Instagram. “Great example of why I fear open ocean swimming so much.
  Surfboards have saved quite a few surfers with that tiny barrier.” Surf Life
  Saving New South Wales said a boy was bitten by a shark at the same location
  less than two months ago. “Just after 8am this morning the Surf Life Saving
  NSW state operations centre was alerted to an incident at the unpatrolled
  Cabarita beach,” the spokesperson said. “Australian Lifeguard Service
  lifeguards … immediately worked with council to close the beach and put up
  signage to warn the public not to enter the water.” Drones were sent up to
  surveil the ocean after the incident, they added.
