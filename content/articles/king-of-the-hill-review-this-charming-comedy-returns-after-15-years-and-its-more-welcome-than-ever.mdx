  It’s been 15 years since we last enjoyed the company of Hank and Peggy Hill.
  Barack Obama had just entered the White House, Hank was a younger man with an
  exciting adventure ahead of him and all was, if not quite well with the world,
  certainly at least explicable. But now? Season 14 of this revived, beloved
  animated sitcom is upon us, feeling anachronistic yet also oddly timely. It’s
  like reconnecting with a group of old friends and realising that, while they
  are much as they always were, the context in which you now see them has
  altered beyond all recognition. Playing slightly against cartoon convention,
  the Hills’ lives have moved on. Unlike, for example, the ageless Simpsons,
  everyone is visibly older. In the intervening years, the propane industry has
  taken Hank and Peggy to Saudi Arabia. As we rejoin them, they are on the plane
  home. Hank has been in the toilet for hours because, as Peggy sees fit to
  inform the other passengers, “he now has the urethra of a seven-month-old”.
  When they touch down in Texas, Hank kisses the ground. But will he recognise
  the place? As they drive around their neighbourhood, Hank has a realisation.
  Their gated community in Saudi Arabia was “more Texan than Texas”. The US has
  exported an idealised version of its past especially for the ex-pats, even as
  the country itself has transformed beyond all recognition. King of the Hill
  always did subtle political messaging, wrapping pointed observations in the
  gentleness of the comedy. Hank is quickly back on familiar territory, standing
  by the fence outside his home, sharing a beer with his old pals. Bill has let
  himself go, badly. Boomhauer is still mumbly. He greets Hank with a slightly
  surprising hug. As a man who still expresses his love for his son by offering
  to check the oil in his car, Hank finds this awkward. But as ever, the writing
  brings a remarkable amount of nuance to these simply but carefully constructed
  characters. Even in retirement, Hank is working through a few things. Dale,
  though, is a different keg of beer altogether. He hasn’t learned anything;
  instead the world has come around to him. Back in the day, Dale’s fondness for
  conspiracy theories made him the butt of the jokes. He doesn’t seem like such
  a harmless eccentric any more, though. Needless to say, he references “the
  pandumbic”. Hank, though, is old school and old media; he had access only to
  Fox News and CNN while in Saudi Arabia – although he feels he has to apologise
  for having watched CNN. Hank is a Republican – during the show’s original run,
  his response to learning that he was driving through Bill Clinton’s home town
  was to lock his car doors. But this adds real poignancy to the new iteration
  of the show. Much has changed in the US and not everything to Hank’s
  satisfaction, with one of those things being public discourse. At one point,
  Hank, Peggy and Dale go on a museum tour themed around George W Bush during
  which they are offered the chance to role-play a cabinet meeting. However, it
  degenerates into wild fiction as participants start ranting about “Obama’s
  Kenyan handler”. Dale is no longer an outlier – he’s now a thought-leader.
  Mike Judge’s and Greg Daniels’s writing perspective is evident here: Hank
  longs for an old, moderate America that couldn’t always agree, but could at
  least accept shared terms of reference within which they could argue. There
  is, however, a kindness to King of the Hill, which finds equal expression
  alongside the show’s occasional disquiet. There is charm and progress in its
  apparently changeless setting. The Hills’ son, Bobby, was once a chubby, geeky
  misfit. Happily, he has been given an upgrade that feels at once generous,
  eccentric and earned. He is a chef at a Japanese-German restaurant and Hank’s
  and Bobby’s familial battles are now fought via the proxies of food and drink.
  Hank and Bobby enter a brewing contest. “It’s just a friendly contest between
  father and son,” says Hank. “Where the father will kick his son’s ass.” Father
  and son receive a necessary lesson in humility. There remains a lightness and
  ease to these exchanges. Fittingly, as is the case with most longstanding
  relationships, the old rhythms return almost immediately, for the Hills and
  for viewers. Often, King of the Hill drifts toward the neat and the saccharin.
  It’s not a show that will ever hold back on the hugging and learning. But that
  feels entirely deliberate; at the moment, a show prioritising modesty,
  tolerance and gentle revelation feels more welcome than ever. • King of the
  Hill is on Disney+
