  week

  Pick of the week The Surfer Lorcan Finnegan’s sunburnt psychological thriller
  is an electrifying throwback to Australian cinema’s new wave of the 70s and
  its studies in toxic masculinity. Nicolas Cage is almost too perfectly cast as
  “the Surfer”, a father hoping to introduce his teenage son to his childhood
  seaside home and ride some waves. However, a gang of larrikins led by Julian
  McMahon’s smug Scally deem Luna Bay a locals-only venue – and will do anything
  to stop his attempts to surf there. This brightly lit but darkly menacing film
  grows increasingly hallucinatory and nightmarish as the Surfer is stripped of
  his money, phone, food, car, even his board. And Cage on the edge is, as
  always, a magnetic watch. Friday 22 August, 7.25am, 12.35pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema
  Premiere *** Night Always Comes Musician/author Willy Vlautin’s modern noir
  novel is brought to the screen in gritty style by two alumni of The Crown –
  director Benjamin Caron and lead Vanessa Kirby – though the subject matter
  couldn’t be more different. Set over a taut 24 hours, it follows Kirby’s
  Lynette as she races around the city to find the $25,000 needed to buy her
  home before she, her brother and feckless mother are evicted. A drip-feed of
  revelations about her traumatic past life accompany the desperate quest, with
  Kirby superb as a woman torn between what she wants and what she needs. Out
  now, Netflix *** Ill Met By Moonlight The great British partnership of Michael
  Powell and Emeric Pressburger was nearing its end in 1957 when they produced
  this fact-based second world war drama. It isn’t up there with their many
  classics (Powell himself was particularly scathing about it) but there’s a
  surprising jollity to its story of a mission to kidnap a German general
  (Marius Goring) in 1944 Crete and spirit him off the island. Dirk Bogarde is
  the nonchalant leader of the operation, Maj “Paddy” Leigh Fermor, while the
  local resistance are a fun-loving bunch despite the occupation. Saturday 16
  August, 3pm, U&amp;Yesterday *** Hounds In a Casablanca far from the tourist
  traps, petty criminal Hassan (Abdellatif Masstouri) and his as-yet untainted
  son Isaam (Ayoub Elaid) are hired by Hassan’s boss to abduct a man.
  Unfortunately, the victim suffocates in their van, so they set off across the
  city in an error-strewn attempt to dispose of the body before daylight. Kamal
  Lazraq’s neorealist Cannes winner offers a raw but sometimes comic closeup on
  the underbelly of Moroccan society, while the shifts in the father-son
  relationship give the film dramatic heft, despite the leads being
  nonprofessional. Saturday 16 August, 10.30pm, BBC Four *** Reservoir Dogs As a
  tribute to the late Michael Madsen, you could do worse than Quentin
  Tarantino’s 1992 debut. He certainly steals the film as Mr Blonde, with his
  dance/torture routine to the strains of Stuck in the Middle With You. But
  there’s a lot more to recommend it, from the smart if expletive-filled
  dialogue to the rug-pulling flashback plot structure, as a gang of robbers –
  including Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth – assemble after a botched diamond heist
  to work out who is the mole in their midst. Monday 18 August, 11.35pm, ITV4
  *** And Then We Danced “There is no sex in Georgian dance!” The strictures of
  tradition – choreographically and sexually – come down heavily on Merab (an
  affecting Levan Gelbakhiani), a student dancer at the Georgian National
  Ensemble, where a “masculine” performance style is the rule. His attraction to
  new boy/rival Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), which may be mutual, further
  complicates his feelings about his art and life. Levan Akin’s 2019 film – do
  check out his more recent trans drama Crossing – is a tender, troubling
  coming-of-age tale set in a world where difference is only tolerated at the
  margins of society. Tuesday 19 August, 1.50am, Channel 4 *** Hi, Mom! This
  early Brian De Palma effort from 1970 shows the New York-based director
  playing around with some of his influences (Godard, Hitchcock) in a lively if
  slightly scattergun satire. Robert De Niro – himself not fully formed as an
  actor – plays a voyeuristic film-maker trying to make a movie by spying on his
  neighbours in the apartment block opposite. This devolves into a bizarre mock
  documentary about a radical theatre group staging an experience called Be
  Black Baby, which features paint and an education in racial inequality.
  Tuesday 19 August, 3.10am, Talking Pictures TV
