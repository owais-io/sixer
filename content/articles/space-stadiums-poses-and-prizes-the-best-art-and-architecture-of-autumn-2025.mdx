  Art Mona Hatoum: Encounters: Giacometti The Palestinian artist, whose charged
  vision has encompassed everything from an endoscopy video of her own interior
  to a fiery red Earth, takes on the revered modernist Alberto Giacometti in the
  second of a series of dialogues between his sculptures and living art. They
  share a surreal eye for the organic. JJ • Barbican, London, 3 September to 11
  January Hilary Lloyd: Very High Frequency Acerbic, radical and wildly
  inventive, playwright and television dramatist Dennis Potter (1935-1994) is
  the subject of Lloyd’s new work, which includes archival footage from Potter’s
  plays, texts and television interviews, new commentaries and live,
  performative interludes. Potter’s continuing relevance, his politics and his
  stoicism in the face of death provide the core of Lloyd’s project. AS • Studio
  Voltaire, London, 10 September to 11 January Theatre Picasso Most of Tate’s
  Picassos – plus myriad major European loans – star in an exhibition that
  positions the constantly transforming creator as a showman of modern art. It
  juxtaposes his masterpieces with photos and films revealing he was always
  ready to paint for the camera, or pose in a minotaur mask. JJ • Tate Modern,
  London, 17 September to 12 April Kerry James Marshall: The Histories Nearing
  70, Marshall has long deserved a major European retrospective. A towering
  presence in American art, he paints black experience and culture, everyday
  life and art history. His art is filled with symbolism and visual complexity,
  celebrations of black aspiration and what it means to be a painter. AS • Royal
  Academy, London, 20 September to 18 January Marie Antoinette Style There was
  nothing especially stylish about the execution of the last French queen in
  1793, after years of misogynist vilification. Hopefully this exhibition will
  do justice to Marie Antoinette as a victim of political hate, as it tracks her
  life and image through art and fashion, from the 18th century to the modern
  day. JJ • V&amp;A, London, 20 September to 22 March Basel Abbas and Ruanne
  Abou-Rahme In the newly commissioned work Prisoners of Love, the words and
  songs of Palestinian prisoners are counterpoised with testimonies, poems and
  stories recorded across the occupied West Bank, speaking of love and loss and
  home. Orchestrated across multiple screens, this cumulative, stitched-together
  audio-visual narrative is described by the Ramallah and New York-based
  Palestinian artists as a “poetics of resistance”. AS • Nottingham
  Contemporary, 27 September 2025 to 11 January Turner prize 2025 Often reviled,
  the Turner show is an annual checkup on what’s seen as significant. This
  year’s features Nnena Kalu’s obsessive cocoon-like wrappings, Rene Matić’s
  celebrations of relationships, Mohammed Sami’s painted explorations of war,
  fear and exile, and Zadie Xa’s amalgams of textiles, sculpture, sound and
  light. The debate’s the thing, whoever wins. AS • Cartwright Hall Art Gallery,
  Bradford, 27 September to 22 February Lee Miller This daring photographer, who
  moved between reportage and art, gets a retrospective that transports the
  viewer back to her troubled age. Miller was a combat photographer in the
  second world war, and posed in Hitler’s bathtub, yet was also a surrealist who
  experimented with dreamlike effects. Perhaps she proves reality itself is a
  dream. JJ • Tate Britain, London, 2 October to 15 February Made in Ancient
  Egypt Ancient Egyptian art fills us with awe and can look so mysterious it
  seems to come from another planet – but it was all created by human hands.
  This exhibition asks not about the pharaohs, but the inspired artists and
  artisans who created all those stupendous sarcophagi and delicate wall
  paintings. JJ • Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 3 October to 12 April Gilbert
  &amp; George: 21st Century Pictures Pounding montages of London life as
  witnessed by one loving couple walking out from their Spitalfields home every
  day, picking up nitrous oxide empties, autumn leaves and other clues to the
  city’s enormous milieu. This survey of Gilbert &amp; George’s pictures made
  since 2000 includes their moving self-portraits, the duo playing among sets of
  bones. JJ • Hayward Gallery, London, 7 October to 11 January Nigerian
  Modernism Combining a multiplicity of African and European traditions, and
  tracing artistic networks and groups within Nigeria and in Europe, Nigerian
  Modernism takes us from early calls for decolonisation in the 1940s to the
  post-independence economic boom, civil war and beyond. Presenting the work of
  more than 50 artists across 50 years, this should be both instructive and a
  blast. AS • Tate Modern, London, 8 October to 10 May Wayne Thiebaud: American
  Still Life Wayne Thiebaud, who died aged 101 in 2021, was best known as a
  painter of shop-bought cakes and hotdogs, the paint as thick as icing.
  Mistaken for a pop artist, he saw himself more as an heir to Chardin, Manet or
  Cézanne, and the European still-life tradition – though this show is as
  American as apple pie. AS • The Courtauld, London, 10 October to 18 January
  Peter Doig: House of Music As a student, Doig thought he might end up
  designing album covers, and references to music have been a constant in his
  art. For this show, new and recent paintings are accompanied by a collection
  of restored analogue speakers, which will allow DJs and visitors to hear
  selections from Doig’s record collection in the gallery. Real music and
  painted music: the soundtracks of the artist’s process. AS • Serpentine
  Galleries, London, 10 October to 8 February Claire Fontaine: Show Less For
  over 20 years, Palermo-based conceptual artist Claire Fontaine (actually the
  collective of Fulvia Carnevale and James Thornhill) have been provocative and
  thoughtful; their neon Foreigners Everywhere signs proved the leitmotif for
  the 2024 Venice Biennale. Bricks and book jackets, gentle watercolours and a
  vandalised Courbet … much more than a succession of one-liners, their art
  stirs things up. AS • Mimosa House, London,10 October to 6 December Artes
  Mundi 11 This year’s edition of Artes Mundi sees six global artists on display
  in five venues across Wales. Always enlivening and surprising, this biennial
  art prize presents spoken word and performance, painting and installation,
  indigenous knowledge, hidden histories, water divining and who knows what
  more, with a £40,000 prize for the winner. AS • Various venues across Wales,
  24 October to 1 March Wright of Derby: From the Shadows A long overdue
  celebration of this visionary painter of the Enlightenment, whose images of
  scientific experiments transport the viewer into candlelit dramas featuring
  dying birds and distant planets. Wright paints erupting volcanoes, firework
  displays and gothic horror stories with the same curiosity. A sublime artist,
  and a British great. JJ • National Gallery, London, 7 November to 10 May
  Harold Offeh: Mmm Gotta Try a Little Harder, It Could Be Sweet Blurring work
  and play, Ghanaian-born Offeh’s work is a sometimes slapstick affair. Often
  social and collaborative, his art winningly embraces parody and failure.
  Whether celebrating the joys of dancing badly, or recreating the album-cover
  poses of Grace Jones or Luther Vandross, Offeh offers both a kind of
  self-portraiture and an appeal to the imagination. AS • Kettle’s Yard,
  Cambridge, 15 November 2025 to 1 March Maggi Hambling and Sarah Lucas Hambling
  paints and sculpts in a slapdash expressionist style that she seems to have
  learned off Francis Bacon on a drunken night in Soho. Lucas is renowned for
  ironic, angry readymades involving kebabs and fried eggs. But these
  contrasting artists from different generations are friends, and they combine
  forces for this two-gallery, one-street display. AS • Sadie Coles HQ and
  Frankie Rossi Art Projects, London, 20 November to 1 January Caravaggio’s
  Cupid One of the most shocking and challenging artworks you will ever see
  comes to London. Caravaggio’s portrait of his model, Cecco, posing as the god
  of love is an insouciant satire on all the civilised virtues, emblems of which
  this street urchin treads underfoot. It is a bomb in the museum. JJ • Wallace
  Collection, London, 26 November to 12 April Turner and Constable Of all the
  exhibitions marking JMW Turner’s and John Constable’s 250th birthdays, this is
  the big one. The Tate’s unrivalled collection of works by the duo promises to
  see the lives and legacies of these contemporaries juxtaposed on a grand
  scale. Breathe in the Romantic air and light. JJ • Tate Britain, London, 27
  November to 12 April Design and architecture Space After four decades of
  wowing visitors with its Apollo command module and crinkly astronaut suits,
  the Science Museum’s space gallery will reopen in September with a dazzling
  array of recent innovations – from prototype electric propulsion technology,
  to a “rolly-polly” moon rover, to the Soyuz capsule that carried Tim Peake to
  the International Space Station. OW •Science Museum, London, from 20 September
  Home Ground: The Architecture of Football Hot on the heels of the Lionesses’
  victory at the Euros, the RIBA (the Royal Institute of British Architects)
  continues the celebrations with an exhibition on the history of football
  stadium design. Brimming with architectural models, photographs and archival
  material, the show will chart the evolution from the earliest stands to
  Everton’s futuristic new spaceship of a stadium. OW • Tate Liverpool + RIBA
  North, Liverpool, 15 October to 25 January Wes Anderson: The Archives No other
  film director can lay claim to having such a recognisable aesthetic as
  Anderson, a man whose name has become synonymous with pastel colour palettes,
  retro interiors and symmetrical compositions. This blockbuster exhibition will
  feature more than 600 objects, including original storyboards, sketches,
  paintings, puppets, and dozens of meticulous miniature models to bring his
  surrealist world to life. OW • Design Museum, London, 21 November to 26 July
  Fungi: Anarchist Designers Step into the magical world of mycelium this
  autumn, with an exhibition on the far-reaching power of mushrooms, mould and
  mycorrhizal networks. This research-led show will explore everything from
  mapping the toxic effects of “fungicide cocktails” on banana plantations in
  the Philippines, to an interactive, multisensory work on how yeast has changed
  human digestion. OW • Nieuwe Instituut, Rotterdam, 21 November to 2 May Muji:
  100 designs How did Muji – which means “no brand” – become one of the most
  distinctive design brands in the world? Explore the philosophy behind the
  Japanese masters of minimalist homewares, with a range of everyday items
  produced by more than 100 makers from across Japan – including ceramic, glass,
  wood, lacquer, paper, leather and metalwork, which all embody Muji’s simple,
  functional approach. OW • Japan House, London, December to April
