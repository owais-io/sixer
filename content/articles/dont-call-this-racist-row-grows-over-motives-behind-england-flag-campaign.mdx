  “This is NOT racist never has been never will be,” reads the fundraising page
  of a group calling itself the Wythall Flaggers, which by Tuesday afternoon had
  raised more than £2,000, mostly in small donations of £5 and £10. “We have
  members of the community of all ethnicities and religions stopping by and
  praising what we are doing so please don’t call this racist.” The money,
  according to the page’s organiser, will be used for “coating the local
  community in England flags as this is home and we should be patriotic and
  proud … We need help to cover every street in Wythall with our beautiful St
  George’s cross.” If only all in the Worcestershire village, south of
  Birmingham, agreed. Footage posted on social media earlier this week claims to
  show an elderly couple using a ladder to remove the English national flag from
  a lamp-post in the village. One comment on social media reads: “Traitors.”
  Just weeks after many people in England united around its national flag as the
  country’s female football team won the European championships, the cross of St
  George and the British union jack are being raised again in communities across
  the country. This time however, it is part of an increasingly organised
  campaign that claims to be purely about patriotism but which many fear – amid
  a climate of anti-migrant protests and rising far-right activity – could be
  much more divisive and dangerous. “Let’s bring back patriotism once and for
  all,” reads the Facebook page of Operation Raise the Colours, which urges
  members to post images of the assorted national flags of the four British
  nations “being raised around our great towns and cities”. Users from Walsall
  and Coventry and Redditch have posted images of flags on lamp-posts and
  painted on mini-roundabouts and folded in piles ready for deployment. “In case
  anyone needs flags Temu has them,” wrote one poster. Amazon has a deal on
  flagpoles, suggested another. A third posted a plea that the union flag be
  hung the right way up. However anti-racism campaigners say they have concerns
  about the motivation and timing of the movement. “We are concerned that the
  discussion around the English flag and patriotism is giving cover for racism
  driven by the far right, and – shamefully – by politicians of all shades,”
  said Lewis Nielsen, anti-fascist officer at Stand Up to Racism. “We do feel
  the movement is quite dangerous and comes at a tipping point where the far
  right is trying to build.” Having apparently grown out of efforts last month
  in the Birmingham suburbs of Weoley Castle and Northfield, flag-flying has
  gathered pace in the city and elsewhere, attracting controversy – and wider
  political and media attention – after the city council said it would remove
  banners and flags from lamp-posts as part of a plan to upgrade to LED
  lighting. Flags have been hung in neighbourhoods across the city, with social
  media posts claiming “patriotic people” were putting new banners up on
  lamp-posts as quickly as local authority staff removed them. The council has
  said it has no policy of removing flags, saying it “proudly” flew the union
  flag outside the Council House every day. “When it comes to items attached to
  lamp-posts, it is normal council procedure for these to be removed on a
  regular basis … As has always been the case, people are free to fly or hang
  flags from their homes or gardens, but we ask that they are not attached to
  street furniture.” Many self-described patriots remain outraged, however, and
  the controversy gathered further pace after the London borough of Tower
  Hamlets, which has been a flashpoint for anti-migrant protests, confirmed this
  week that it was removing St George flags from lamp-posts. The 12 councils
  controlled by Reform jointly pledged on Monday that they would not take down
  union or St George flags, calling them “symbols of unity and inclusion”. Tower
  Hamlets council said said: “While we recognise people wish to express their
  views, we have a responsibility to monitor and maintain council
  infrastructure. Where flags are attached to council-owned infrastructure
  without permission, they may be removed as part of routine maintenance.” Asked
  about the issue on Tuesday, Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said the
  prime minister was a “patriot” who believed people should “absolutely” fly the
  British and English flags, later clarifying that he was not familiar with
  events in Birmingham or Tower Hamlets. “The PM’s always been clear about his
  pride in Britain, reflected in the fact we often have the St George’s flag,
  and other flags, flying in Downing Street.” Meanwhile Operation Raise the
  Colours has ambitions to spread further. “Over 800 people in less than 40
  hours is impressive and shows people’s passion for this,” an admin posted on
  the group on Tuesday. “We ideally need to be organising into local Groups and
  hitting areas en mass [sic].. As many as possible in as little time as
  possible.”
