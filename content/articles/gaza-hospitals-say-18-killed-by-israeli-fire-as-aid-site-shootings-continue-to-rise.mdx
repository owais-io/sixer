  Hospitals in Gaza say Israeli fire killed more than a dozen people on
  Saturday, eight of them while trying to get food, as malnutrition-related
  deaths continue to rise in the territory. The bloodshed comes a day after
  Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, visited an aid
  distribution site run by the Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation
  (GHF). Global outrage has grown over Israel’s restrictions on aid and the
  deadly unrest surrounding the GHF sites, with daily reports of shootings at
  all four locations since the group took over aid distribution at the end of
  May. The UN says 859 Palestinians have been killed during that time in the
  vicinity of these sites, and more than 500 have been killed along the routes
  of food convoys. Health officials reported that Israeli airstrikes and gunfire
  killed at least 18 Palestinians on Saturday, including three who were in the
  area around a distribution site. Nasser hospital also said Israeli forces
  killed five Palestinians who were among crowds awaiting aid in the south. In a
  statement to the Associated Press, GHF said “nothing (happened) at or near our
  sites”. Both the GHF and the Israeli army have said they only shoot if there
  is a threat, or fire warning shots to disperse crowds. Doctors in Gaza have
  reported treating an increasing number of gunshot and shrapnel wounds in
  patients who were trying to get food at the aid sites. “We weren’t close to
  them [the troops] and there was no threat,” a witness, Abed Salah, who was
  among crowds close to the GHF site near Netzarim corridor, told AP. “I escaped
  death miraculously.” Officials added that 10 of Saturday’s casualties were
  killed by strikes in central and southern Gaza, with five people killed in two
  separate strikes on tents sheltering displaced people. The US ambassador to
  Israel Mike Huckabee, who accompanied Witkoff on the trip on Friday, claimed
  the GHF sites were delivering “more than one million meals a day” and called
  the distribution “an incredible feat”. Reports from aid workers, doctors, and
  journalists in Gaza paint a different story, with UN-backed food security
  experts saying this week that the “worst-case scenario of famine” is now
  playing out in Gaza. Seven Palestinians died of malnutrition-related causes
  over the past 24 hours, including a child, the territory’s health ministry
  said on Saturday. This brings the total deaths among children from causes
  related to malnutrition in Gaza to 93 since the war began. After international
  outcry, airdrops of aid have resumed, and several European countries have
  announced plans to join the Jordan-led coalition orchestrating the drops, but
  aid groups say this delivers only a fraction of what aid trucks can supply –
  and are also dangerous. What is really needed, they say, is to open the land
  borders and restore the full flow of aid. “If there is political will to allow
  airdrops – which are highly costly, insufficient + inefficient, there should
  be similar political will to open the road crossings,” Philippe Lazzarini, the
  head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X on Saturday. The
  German government, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, joined calls for
  Israel to deliver more aid on Saturday, saying that the current amount remains
  “very insufficient”. The criticism came after the German military completed
  its first food airdrops into Gaza. In Tel Aviv, Witkoff joined families of
  hostages protesting, as they urged the Israeli government to end the war and
  release their loved ones. Yotam Cohen, brother of 21-year-old hostage Nimrod
  Cohen, told AFP: “The war needs to end. The Israeli government will not end it
  willingly. It has refused to do so.” Negotiations between Hamas and Israel
  aimed at securing a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and a deal for the release of
  hostages ended in deadlock last week, with Witkoff blaming Hamas for a “lack
  of desire to reach a ceasefire”. Hamas said on Saturday that it would not lay
  down arms unless an independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state is
  established.
