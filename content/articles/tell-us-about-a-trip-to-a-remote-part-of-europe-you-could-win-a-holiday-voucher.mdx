  There are times when we want to disappear from the world for a while and
  escape to somewhere truly off-the-beaten track. Whether it’s a remote island,
  a forest hideaway, a sparsely populated swathe of countryside, or a town few
  tourists visit, we want to hear about trips in Europe where you’ve really been
  able to get away from it all. The best tip of the week, chosen by Tom Hall of
  Lonely Planet wins a £200 voucher to stay at a Coolstays property – the
  company has more than 3,000 worldwide. The best tips will appear in the
  Guardian Travel section and website. Keep your tip to about 100 words If you
  have a relevant photo, do send it in – but it’s your words we will be judging
  for the competition. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK
  resident to enter this competition. The competition closes on Monday 18 August
  at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and
  conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms
  of service here and privacy policy here.
