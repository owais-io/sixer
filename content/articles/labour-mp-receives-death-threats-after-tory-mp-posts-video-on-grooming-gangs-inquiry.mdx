  A Labour MP has said she has been subjected to death threats and online
  misogynistic abuse after a video was shared by a Conservative MP about her
  position on a national inquiry into grooming gangs. Anna Dixon, the MP for
  Shipley in West Yorkshire, said police are investigating the threats and has
  accused the MP for Keighley and Ilkley, Robbie Moore, of disseminating
  “misinformation” about her stance on the issue. Moore posted a video on
  Wednesday on social media with the caption: “Shipley’s Labour MP Anna Dixon is
  ‘misleading public’ on grooming gangs inquiry. “Anna is telling constituents
  she voted against an inquiry because it was a ‘political stunt’. But a closer
  look at the facts shows Anna has been dismissing calls for an inquiry since
  day one.” Dixon denies the claims and said she only voted against a Tory
  proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs because it included an
  amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. She also rebutted
  suggestions that she opposes a Bradford district focus as part of the inquiry.
  Moore said he condemns threats of violence but said the video he posted
  “raises legitimate concerns” about Dixon’s position on a grooming gangs
  inquiry in Bradford. In a statement on Saturday Dixon said: “I want local
  residents to be aware that I have received threats of death and violence
  directly posted in response to a misleading video recently shared by the MP
  for Keighley and Ilkley, Robbie Moore. “These have been reported to the
  police, and an investigation is currently under way. It is irresponsible
  behaviour for any MP of any party to put out such blatant misinformation about
  a colleague.” Dixon added: “I have always been transparent and direct with
  constituents about my reasons for voting in favour of the government’s
  children’s wellbeing and schools bill in January 2025, and I am disturbed by
  Robbie Moore’s seeming willingness to spread misinformation on this scale with
  his constituents and beyond, particularly when it pertains to such a serious
  issue. “In January, the Conservative party put forward a proposal for a
  national inquiry into grooming gangs by introducing a wrecking amendment to
  the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. If this amendment had passed, it
  would have effectively killed the bill, which aimed to enhance safeguards for
  children. “I am also shocked by the claim made in the video shared by Robbie
  Moore that I would oppose a Bradford district focus as part of a national
  inquiry into grooming gangs. This is extremely concerning when the video in
  question features extracts from an email I sent to one of my constituents on 6
  August, the full text of which includes the statement: ‘If the national
  inquiry deems that another local inquiry is needed in Bradford, this is
  something I and the local authority will fully support.’ He has chosen to omit
  this from his video.” In response, Moore said: “I utterly condemn any threats
  of violence against elected politicians or anyone in public life … I would
  urge readers to watch the full video in question, which is not a personal
  attack and raises legitimate concerns about the MP for Shipley’s public
  position on a grooming inquiry in Bradford.” He added: “I recently organised a
  cross-party letter to the prime minister on this issue, signed by 98 MPs from
  six different political parties, including Labour. Unfortunately, the MP for
  Shipley was not one of them. “We are now in a situation in Bradford where
  victims and survivors and leading child abuse lawyers are desperately calling
  for a focus on Bradford in the grooming gangs inquiry, with a sitting Labour
  peer explicitly saying there has been a cover-up inside Bradford council. “The
  fact that the MP for Shipley does not and, from her public comments today,
  still does not unequivocally support a focus on Bradford in this national
  inquiry is both a newsworthy and legitimate concern.”
