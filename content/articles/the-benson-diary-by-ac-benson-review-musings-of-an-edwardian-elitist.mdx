  AC Benson is remembered today, if at all, for having edited three volumes of
  Queen Victoria’s letters and for writing Land of Hope and Glory to accompany
  Elgar’s first Pomp and Circumstance march – though, like Elgar, he came to
  dislike the vainglorious imperial sentiments that the words express – “vulgar
  stuff and not my manner at all”. Born in 1862, he began his working life as a
  school master at Eton, before moving on in 1904 to Magdalene College,
  Cambridge, where he was first a fellow and then master. Notably, he left
  voluminous diaries – over four million words, filling 180 bound volumes – four
  times the length of the diaries of Samuel Pepys, who had been an undergraduate
  at Magdalene. Benson was well connected and knew most of the political and
  literary elite of late Victorian and Edwardian Britain, so one might have
  expected him to offer a similarly unrivalled portrait of the age. Many believe
  that he did: one review of these two edited volumes declares that because of
  them, he has entered “the diarists’ pantheon”. But though he met plenty of
  writers and other figures of note, he has little of value to say about them.
  Indeed his literary judgments are crass when not philistine: Henry James’s
  “idea of art was to tell a tale that few could understand or to present
  figures so faint &amp; vague as seldom to be more than hypothetical”; Arnold
  Bennett was “a cad”; of Housman: “I don’t think he is quite a gentleman”. His
  musical opinions were even worse. In a concert that included works by Weber,
  Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, he declared the best work to be
  one by Waldemar Bargiel, a composer otherwise unknown to history; while,
  “fifty years hence people will probably talk of Wagner as claptrap and wonder
  how anyone could admire”. Zsa Zsa Gabor once remarked that Britain was a
  country of boys and old boys: this is a book for the old boys His outlook is
  that of an Edwardian clubman; and indeed, the only England Benson knew well,
  apart from Eton, Cambridge and the court at Windsor Castle, was the
  smoke-filled rooms of Pall Mall, a world largely without women. Benson did not
  much like women and was not at ease with them, preferring the company of
  handsome young men. The editors go to great pains to argue that Benson, while
  certainly homoerotic, was not actively homosexual. But, really, who cares?
  Eamon Duffy and Ronald Hyam are, unlike Benson, distinguished academics. They
  have bestowed on these diaries all the apparatus of contemporary research,
  treating the commonplace utterances of obscure dons as if they came from great
  statesmen – but to what end? Anyone with misplaced nostalgia for a supposedly
  golden age of civilised living – an age that fortunately is long gone and
  which no one of sense would wish to see resurrected – may enjoy immersing
  themselves in Benson’s observations. But they would have to be almost as
  steeped in a certain crusted-over establishment atmosphere as he was. Zsa Zsa
  Gabor once remarked that Britain was a country of boys and old boys: this is a
  book for the old boys. In truth, these diaries are a monument of misplaced
  scholarship. No doubt the question of whether the master’s children should be
  allowed to use the Fellows’ Garden was a matter of great moment to the dons in
  May 1914 but its historical import is unclear. The account of college
  squabbles lacks even the waspishness that we find, for example, in the letters
  of AJP Taylor or Hugh Trevor-Roper. They at least serve to confirm Henry
  Kissinger’s dictum that academic disputes are so vicious precisely because the
  stakes are so low. What the diaries offer, as was once said – perhaps unfairly
  – of Trollope, is the sedative of gossip. They provide the illusion that one
  is in communion with great writers and powerful people, but it’s one we
  shouldn’t fall for. • The Benson Diary by AC Benson, edited Eamon Duffy and
  Ronald Hyam, is published by Pallas Athene (£60). To support the Guardian buy
