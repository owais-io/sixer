  Asian Persuasion review – indie New York romcom of divorcee meddling in his
  ex’s dating life
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-18T12:00:42Z'
bodyText: >-
  It is unexpected to see vintage romcom values upheld in an indie movie
  populated almost exclusively by Filipino-Americans. Tony award-winning
  producer Jhett Tolentino at least has a good high-concept hook for his feature
  directorial debut: a beleaguered divorcee tries to get out of paying alimony
  to his ex-wife by making a fake dating profile to bag her a new partner.
  Sadly, this tonally shaky and borderline-sociopathic outing doesn’t have the
  class or skill to be part of the much-needed renaissance for the genre. Asian
  Persuasion takes place on the great New York dating grounds beloved of many a
  romcom: feckless single dad Mickey (Dante Basco, who played the leader of the
  Lost Boys in Steven Spielberg’s Hook) is struggling to elevate his Queens
  coffee shop, Da Fili Beans, to hipster notoriety. Ponying up payments to his
  fashion designer ex Avery (KC Concepcion) as they co-parent their daughter
  isn’t helping. So during a night on the lash with his wingman Caspian (Kevin
  Kreider), they cook up a scheme to make her someone else’s problem; preppy
  financial analyst Lee-Kwan (Paolo Montalban) is the man they target as their
  best hope. Tolentino’s attempts to court the zeitgeist are often painful,
  including Caspian premiering his latest TikTok dance at the coffee shop, and
  self-conscious dialogue apparently drawn from below-the-line on Instagram
  (“Can I unsubscribe from that memory?”). This extends to a strain of crassness
  (“We’re practically drowning in a tsunami of poon”) that makes for a rough
  transition to true romance, when Mickey uses his insider knowledge to knock
  Lee-Kwan into shape, Cyrano-style, as the ultimate seducer. So it’s not a
  shock when Asian Persuasion lacks the finesse required to pull off the U-turn
  when Mickey decides he wants Avery back. His ham-fisted sushi-bar sabotage
  scheme is completely unconvincing, leaving the already hard-pedalling actors
  looking daft. The cursory flashbacks to the couple’s disintegrating marriage
  first time round don’t add enough depth to make him seem much more than
  manipulative, or her more than an inexplicable dupe. Alternately gullible or
  status-obsessed, its female characters feel retrograde – even featuring a
  French character actually wearing a beret. The film doesn’t exactly cover
  itself in glory, a shame considering Tolentino’s evident zeal for promoting
  Asian representation. • Asian Persuasion is on digital platforms from 25
  August.
