  and that the shooter is now dead. Crews at the scene reported seeing a large
  number of ambulances, according to CBS. Sources told ABC News that there are
  multiple victims from a shooting that took place during morning drop-off at
  Annunciation Catholic school in Minneapolis. Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz,
  said he’d been “briefed on a shooting at Annunciation Catholic school” on
  Wednesday morning and would “continue to provide updates as we get more
  information”. “The [Bureau of Criminal Apprehension] and State Patrol are on
  scene. I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was
  marred by this horrific act of violence,” he wrote on X. Minneapolis’s mayor,
  Jacob Frey, said he is “monitoring reports of horrific violence in south
  Minneapolis” and the “emergency response team has been activated”. Frey was
  also at the scene at around 10:15am EST. The city of Minneapolis’s official X
  account said there is no active threat to the community at this time” as of
  10:29am EST. “The shooter is contained. Stay away from the area to allow
  emergency personnel to help victims – W. 54th Street between Lyndale and
  Nicollet Ave,” the city wrote. The suspect is reportedly dead, according to
  Fox 9. The outlet also reported that the first call to law enforcement went
  through at 8:27am EST, shortly after a mass for students in grades
  Kindergarten through eighth grade was slated to kick off at 8:15am EST. The US
  secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, said on X that the Department of
  Homeland Security is monitoring the shooting. “We are in communication with
  our interagency partners, and will share more information as soon as it
  becomes available. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and
  their families,” Noem said. Donald Trump also said on Truth Social on
  Wednesday morning that he’s been “fully briefed on the tragic shooting” and
  that the “White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please
  join me in praying for everyone involved!” Wednesday’s incident marks the
  fourth shooting in 24 hours in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Over the course of
  Tuesday into Wednesday, three people were shot and killed in three separate
  shootings. At least eight people also suffered gunshot wounds in those
  incidents.
