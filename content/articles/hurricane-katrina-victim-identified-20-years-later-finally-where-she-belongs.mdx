  A woman who died at home during Hurricane Katrina in a community outside New
  Orleans, but who remained unidentified for nearly two decades, has finally
  been named before the storm’s 20th anniversary on Friday. The woman, who was
  identified with the help of New Orleans’s CBS affiliate, WWL Louisiana, has
  been named as Dorothy Virginia Driggers Taquino, 81. The news has given her
  family the opportunity to move her from an unmarked grave at a memorial in New
  Orleans for unidentified Katrina victims to a burial plot that she had
  selected in nearby St Bernard parish, where “she imagined spending eternity”,
  according to an article from the outlet – a local Guardian reporting partner –
  that was published on Wednesday. “All I can say is that she’s finally going to
  be where she belongs,” niece Jean Driggers told WWL evening news anchor Devin
  Bartolotta. Driggers recalled how she and other relatives had been unable to
  reach her “Aunt Dot” – who was widowed and lived in the New Orleans-area
  suburb of Arabi, which was ultimately devastated by the storm – when they
  decided to evacuate shortly before Katrina’s arrival on 29 August 2005. “I was
  torn. It really did hurt me, but I just didn’t know what to do at the time,”
  Driggers said to WWL of Taquino, whose closest living blood relatives at the
  time were her niece and a nephew. Taquino was found dead in her inundated home
  on 12 September 2005, according to WWL. Her body was moved along with hundreds
  of others to a temporary morgue erected in St Gabriel, Louisiana, about 65
  miles (105km) west of New Orleans, the site of catastrophic federal levee
  failures during Katrina and where many of the roughly 1,400 people who died as
  a result of the storm had lived. Yet, as WWL recounted, investigators
  struggled to confirm her identity in the chaotic aftermath of the hurricane.
  Driggers provided a genetic sample to investigators to aid their efforts to
  locate Taquino, but they reportedly said it was not enough to positively
  confirm an identification. Taquino’s remains were entombed alongside 83 other
  unidentified storm victims at the Hurricane Katrina memorial near New Orleans
  City Park. Taquino was one of 30 people who had still not been identified as
  of the start of the summer, when WWL Louisiana said it began investigating the
  status of unidentified storm victims. Using information from sources such as
  the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, along with a file of
  more than 800 autopsies completed by federal mortuary teams in the temporary
  morgue in St Gabriel, the outlet took notice of one case involving a woman
  found dead after the storm in Arabi while wearing a necklace engraved with the
  words “Joseph Kohn high school”. Her case was the only one of the few with
  detailed information that originated from outside New Orleans’s city limits.
  The outlet reached out to Ray Theriot, the coroner whose jurisdiction includes
  Arabi, and he gave the case a fresh look. Theriot relied on utility bills,
  driver’s license files and property records to substantiate that a woman
  matching Taquino’s description had lived at the Arabi address where a body had
  been found. He then matched Taquino’s high school diploma to the inscription
  on the Joseph Kohn necklace. “We’ve got the right person. There’s no doubt,”
  Theriot told Bartolotta of WWL, bringing down to 29 the number of unidentified
  victims remaining at the memorial. The process of moving Taquino from the
  memorial in New Orleans to her chosen burial plot remained incomplete as
  Katrina’s 20th anniversary neared. WWL reported that the relocation was
  evidently being slowed by a need to locate records among numerous file boxes,
  which had been shuffled during multiple New Orleans coroner’s office moves in
  the years since Katrina. Driggers nonetheless said she took comfort in
  Taquino’s identification, which she learned about when Theriot visited her
  house. She recalled thinking to herself “if you love something, you have to
  let it go” after being disappointed that the earlier genetic sample had not
  been enough to help track down Taquino. “Well … it came knocking at my door,”
  Driggers said. “So it was meant to be.”
