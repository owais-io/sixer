  The creator of Fortnite, Epic Games, has won a partial victory in the
  Australian federal court against Apple and Google over restrictions in app
  stores and failing to allow for competition for in-app payment options, but it
  could be a long time before any changes are made in Australia. Fortnite was
  kicked off the Google and Apple app stores in 2020 after Epic Games offered
  its own in-app payment system that bypassed the one used by the platforms, and
  cut out the fees Apple and Google receive for in-app payments. Epic fought the
  ban by launching legal action against the two in multiple jurisdictions. In
  the Australian cases, Epic Games alleged that Apple’s control over in-app
  purchases – preventing users from downloading apps outside the app store and
  preventing developers from running their own app store on iOS – were a misuse
  of market power, which substantially lessened competition in app development.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email The company also alleged Google harmed app
  developers and consumers in Australia by preventing choice over app
  distribution and in-app payments on Android devices. Apple’s iOS and App Store
  are completely closed and controlled by Apple: if an app is on your phone, and
  there is a payment through that app, it has to go through Apple. Similar rules
  apply on Google’s Android operating system for the Play Store, but Google also
  allows “side-loading” of apps – meaning apps installed directly on the phone
  without using the app store. It also allows for phone manufacturers such as
  Samsung to have their own app stores. Fortnite is still available on Android,
  but only through side-loading. Each company charges fees for transactions in
  their app stores. Google Play charges a 15% fee for the first US$1m earned by
  developers each year, increasing to 30% above that. Apple developers pay a 15%
  fee if the revenue generated the previous year is lower than $1m, but pay 30%
  if they earn more than that. Fees are common in the industry – Epic’s own
  store charges developers a 12% fee. Epic argued that it should be able to
  offer its own store as competition to Apple’s store, and also offer
  alternative payment options within their app in the official Games Store.
  Originally separate, the Australian cases were combined into a single
  monolith. Justice Jonathan Beach decided to hear the two cases and an
  associated class action at the same time to avoid duplication of witness
  evidence. On Tuesday, Beach found that Apple had engaged in conduct likely to
  diminish competition, in breach of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer
  Act over preventing side-loading of apps on iOS, and by preventing developers
  using alternative payment methods for digital purchases. For Google, it was
  found to breach section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act for the similar
  Google Play billing system, and over Google’s Project Hug, a project that
  allegedly saw developers enticed to keep their apps in the Play Store. Epic
  did not succeed in its other claims against the two companies. In a post on X,
  Epic Games stated that its app store and Fortnite would come to iOS in
  Australia, but noted there were 2,000+ pages of findings that “we’ll need to
  dig into to fully understand the details”. “This is a WIN for developers and
  consumers in Australia!” A spokesperson for Google said the court recognised
  the “stark difference between Android’s open platform and Apple’s closed
  system” and welcomed the court’s rejection that Epic sought to run an app
  store within the app store. However Google disagreed with “the court’s
  characterisation of our billing policies and practices, as well as its
  findings regarding some of our historical partnerships, which were all shaped
  in a fiercely competitive mobile landscape on behalf of users and developers”.
  “We will review the full decision when we receive it and assess our next
  steps,” the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Apple said the company also
  disagreed with the court’s ruling on some of Epic’s claims. “Apple faces
  fierce competition in every market where we operate,” the spokesperson said.
  “We continuously invest and innovate to make the App Store the safest place
  for users to get apps and a great business opportunity for developers in
  Australia and around the world.” Powerful corporations ‘must play by the
  rules’ Any potential changes to the app stores and payment systems for Apple
  and Google in Australia are likely to be a long way off. Beach delivered a
  summary of his judgment in the long-running case on Tuesday in a marathon hour
  and a half reading to cover the two Epic cases and two class actions, ahead of
  a full judgment being released with redactions to account for commercial
  sensitivities at a later date. The Apple and Google judgments run to over 900
  pages each, with the class action judgment running over 100 pages, Beach
  indicated. The two class action cases were successful. Brought by app
  developers against Apple and Google, the cases focused on whether the
  companies had overcharged developers over app store purchases given their
  market dominance. The amount that developers would have otherwise been charged
  by the two companies, and the relief they will see from the case will be
  determined at a later hearing. “This judgment is a turning point,” said Kimi
  Nishimura, principal at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, the firm representing the
  app developers. “It sends a clear message that even the most powerful
  corporations must play by the rules and respect the rights of consumers and
  developers alike.” The case was heard over four months, finishing just over
  one year ago. Fortnite has returned to the Apple app store in the US, and
  users can download via the Epic Games app store in Europe but the app still
  remains unavailable to download in Australia except on Android via
  side-loading.
