  The credits for the new Match of the Day are in a comic-book style. Your
  screen bursts with fruit machine cherries when Bournemouth pop up, and freezes
  when Cole Palmer appears. Erling Haaland sits in the lotus pose under a blue
  moon. The most unlikely moment is saved until the title card appears, however,
  with the camera disappearing inside the bottom of the Premier League trophy,
  down a silver tunnel and out, directly, into Mark Chapman’s face. Chapman is a
  long-time BBC Sport anchor and the main man on Radio 5 Live. He is hardly an
  unknown quantity, but here he had been grabbed by a stylist and given a
  vaguely modish air with designer stubble and a cream overshirt hanging loosely
  off his shoulders. One of three presenters charged with taking the BBC’s
  venerable football highlights show out of the Gary Lineker era, he has to
  strike a balance between being familiar and fresh. He did so by making a dad
  joke about it; that’s MotD heritage. “You may have seen and heard that there
  is a big change to the show this season,” Chapman said as we emerged from the
  trophy tunnel. “And that is … Wayne Rooney has joined us a regular pundit.”
  Pause for laughter. “Some things don’t change, Alan Shearer is still here,” he
  went on as Rooney chuckled audibly in the background. With Match of the Day
  there’s never any time to dwell and as soon as Chapman had introduced himself
  and his colleagues in their ribbed polo shirts we were into the action. We
  began at Sunderland and their impressive opening win against West Ham, with
  Rooney detailing the shift in offensive width that opened up the game. “I
  actually got one of my only wins against them,” said the former Plymouth
  manager of the Black Cats. “Got that in early, well done,” Chapman noted. From
  there it was City and some hyperbole over a new signing (an opening day
  tendency as old as time): “Almost the perfect midfield performance,” said
  Shearer of Tijjani Reijnders. At Tottenham v Burnley we watched Martin
  Dubravka become the first goalkeeper to cough up a corner for holding the ball
  longer than eight seconds. The debate on Brighton v Fulham began with penalty
  decisions – perhaps the most consistent fascination of MotD producers over the
  past decade. There was also an advert for an interview elsewhere on the BBC
  with, well, Rooney. “Blimey, you’re taking over,” said Chapman. Rooney had
  been the main attraction at a football-themed bar in Westfield, Shepherd’s
  Bush, on Thursday night as the BBC launched its new season’s coverage in front
  of an audience of distracted influencers. This year he will be not only on
  MotD and interviewed elsewhere, he will also have his own twice-weekly podcast
  that, in the words of the BBC, will feature him “diving into the football
  debates that are dominating your algorithm”. When Rooney came up on stage to
  talk about it, he was obscured by a projection of his own face and the show
  was described as “not intentionally funny, just funny”. So stay tuned on that
  one. The England and Manchester United icon shows signs of promise as a
  pundit. He’s articulate, and on Saturday night was able to conjure up the
  right word when you could see he was looking for it. He is tactically
  insightful and has a wealth of experience to draw from too, obviously, able
  here to compare the current situation of Alexander Isak to the time he handed
  in a transfer request at Old Trafford. Most intriguingly, he clearly preserves
  that bite that marked him out as a player, and strong opinions are likely to
  be forthcoming. Those hoping to dominate any algorithms will be excited at
  this prospect, but it also speaks to a tension that exists between the BBC’s
  new strategy and a 62‑year‑old show that’s an icon of TV. The BBC’s sports
  coverage has always been predictable, consistent and middle of the road. It’s
  part of what made the nation able to sit and watch it together (something
  that’s still true, with BBC coverage of the Lionesses’ Euro 2025 win last
  month the most watched broadcast in the UK this year). It is not,
  traditionally at least, a home for the deliberately provocative form of
  digital punditry known as “hot takes”. On the other hand, it’s hard to hide
  from the fact that the average viewer of BBC One is in their 60s, while less
  than half of 16- to 24-year-olds watch broadcast TV. The BBC has a need to
  serve those audiences and clearly its strategy for the new season is designed
  with them in mind. “We’re not just covering the games, we’re following the
  fans,” is the line. The many people who build their lives around its coverage
  will hope it doesn’t shift too much. Certainly listening to Don Hutchison on 5
  Live on Friday night was as informed an introduction to the season as you are
  likely to hear, even if it did go on a bit. “You could say the more things
  change, the more they stay the same,” was Chapman’s take as he signed off the
  first show of the season, but there is one change that could prove
  unexpectedly disruptive. With presenters and suits alike trying to tread an
  impossibly fine line between reliability and novelty, the BBC has managed this
  season to bring forward the time it can show Premier League highlights online.
  You can now watch the goals from 8pm on a Saturday, bringing an end to years
  of frustration around antiquated embargoes. At the same time, it also means
  you can have worked through all the action hours before the BBC’s flagship
  show has even gone on air. Funny old game, as they used to say.
