  European leaders gathered in Washington on Monday for Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
  meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in a show of support for the
  Ukrainian president. Their presence came amid expectations that Trump would
  try to bully Zelenskyy into accepting a pro-Russia “peace plan” that would
  include Kyiv handing territory to Moscow. The Europeans have been described as
  Zelenskyy’s “bodyguards”, with memories fresh of the mauling he received in
  February during his last Oval Office visit. So, who are they? Mark Rutte
  Secretary general of Nato Rutte has a proven record of flattering Trump for
  strategic purposes, using language that some allies find cringe-making. In
  June he referred to the capricious US president as “Daddy” in an attempt to
  avoid disastrous outbursts at the Nato summit. Rutte has repeatedly praised
  Trump in public, including in a recent interview on Fox News, and credits him
  for pushing Nato members to spend 3.5% of their GDP on defence. The US had
  carried the burden of European security for too long, Rutte has said – music
  to Trump’s ears. Ursula von der Leyen President of the European Commission Von
  der Leyen is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who backs Kyiv’s EU membership.
  For Trump, she is a reminder of Europe’s combined importance as an economic
  bloc. The US struck a trade deal with the EU three weeks ago, and Trump hailed
  the relationship as “the biggest trading partnership in the world”. On Sunday
  she hosted Zelenskyy in Brussels. She said a post-peace-deal Ukraine had to
  become “a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders”, with no
  limits on its armed forces. Keir Starmer UK prime minister Starmer has
  performed a balancing act when it comes to Trump, keeping him on side while
  advocating for Ukraine. So far, this tactic has worked. The US president has
  gone out of his way to emphasise their good relations, despite Starmer’s
  “liberal” outlook. Both men have an incentive to preserve this rapport ahead
  of Trump’s state visit next month to the UK. Meanwhile, Starmer and Zelenskyy
  have developed a warm personal relationship, hugging in February outside
  Downing Street after Zelenskyy’s previous, disastrous Oval Office meeting, and
  again last week. The prime minister stresses territorial integrity, which
  contradicts Trump’s “peace deal” that involves Russia taking more Ukrainian
  land. Alexander Stubb President of Finland Stubb represents a small European
  state but he will be in Washington because he has managed to establish an
  unexpectedly warm relationship with Trump. The Finnish leader cultivated his
  access to the US president by hastily polishing his rusty golfing skills
  before an impromptu trip to Florida in March for a round with Trump, on the
  recommendation of the Republican senator Lindsey Graham. Stubb’s message on
  the putting green: you can’t trust Vladimir Putin. Finland sees parallels
  between Ukraine’s plight and its own history, the Soviet Union having invaded
  in 1939, saying it needed Finnish territory. Emmanuel Macron French president
  Macron combines French economic and military clout with a proven ability to
  get on with Trump, symbolised by their intense handshakes. In the lead-up to
  Russia’s 2022 invasion, Macron flew to Moscow to reason with Putin. He has
  since become a key diplomatic ally for Ukraine. Asked on Sunday whether Putin
  wanted a genuine peace deal, Macron replied: “No.” He said Ukraine needed a
  strong army and security guarantees if a lasting settlement was to be
  achieved. The French president will want to persuade Trump that his
  post-Alaska-summit plan to stop the fighting is a non-starter, and against
  Ukraine and Europe’s long-term security interests. Friedrich Merz German
  president Merz has cut a sure-footed figure on the world stage since taking
  office in May, including largely holding his own in an Oval Office face-off
  with Trump over the summer. He has emerged as a crucial partner for Zelenskyy,
  who was often frustrated with Merz’s slow-moving predecessor, Olaf Scholz.
  Berlin has clout as one pillar of the French-German axis at the heart of the
  EU. It is also a major financial donor to Kyiv. Merz’s task in the Oval Office
  is to persuade Trump not to act hastily and “over the heads of Ukrainians and
  Europeans”, as he put it last week. Giorgia Meloni Prime minister of Italy
  Meloni has broken off from her holiday to fly to Washington, a sign that
  Trump’s Russia-friendly “peace plan” marks a moment of danger for Europe. She
  will be a useful bridge in the Oval Office meeting, as a European far-right
  leader whom Trump counts as a friend. Meloni has spent time at Mar-a-Lago, the
  US president’s Florida home, and was the only European leader invited to his
  inauguration in January. At the same time, she strongly supports Kyiv’s
  sovereignty. In July she hosted a Ukraine recovery conference in Rome,
  designed to help the country rebuild when Russia’s war finally ends.
