  terrifying, white-knuckle comeback

  Kathryn Bigelow has reopened the subject that we all tacitly agree not to
  discuss or imagine, in the movies or anywhere else: the subject of an actual
  nuclear strike. It’s the subject which tests narrative forms and thinkability
  levels. Maybe this is why we prefer to see it as something for absurdism and
  satire – a way of not staring into the sun – to remember Kubrick’s (brilliant)
  black comedy Dr Strangelove, with no fighting in the war room etc, rather than
  Lumet’s deadly serious Fail Safe. Bigelow, with screenwriter Noah Oppenheim,
  broaches one of the most frightening thoughts of all: that a nuclear war could
  or rather will start with no one knowing who started it or who ended it. I
  watched this film with translucently white knuckles but also that strange
  climbing nausea that only this topic can create. The drama is recounted in one
  18-minute segment, repeated from various standpoints and various locations: 18
  minutes being the time estimated to elapse between military observers
  reporting the out-of-the-blue launch of a nuke from the Pacific and its
  projected arrival in Chicago. The action plays out in a series of situation
  rooms and command-and-control suites with acronyms like PEOC (Presidential
  Emergency Operations Center) featuring military and civilian personnel in
  banks of desks, generally in a shallow horseshoe shape facing a very big
  screen flashing up the threat level from Defcon 2 to Defcon 1 and also showing
  a large map displaying the missile’s current position, which is occasionally
  replaced with what amounts to a Zoom mosaic of tense faces belonging to
  high-ranking officials with no idea what to do, dialling in chaotically from
  their smartphones. Rebecca Ferguson plays intelligence analyst Capt Olivia
  Walker, Tracy Letts is the gung ho military chief Gen Anthony Brady – this
  drama’s equivalent of the cold war’s Gen Curtis LeMay – who advocates an
  immediate pre-emptive counterstrike before the incoming missile arrives, Jared
  Harris is the defense secretary Reid Baker who realises that his estranged
  daughter is in Chicago, Gabriel Basso plays the brilliant and flustered young
  NSA adviser Jake Baerington who, if this was an Aaron Sorkin script, could be
  relied on to save the day. Jonah Hauer-King plays the thin-faced, priestly
  naval officer Lt Cmdr Robert Reeves who accompanies the president at all times
  with a ring-bound folder with the nuclear strike options and authorisation
  codes. Idris Elba plays the president himself, who, like George W Bush finding
  out about 9/11 at an infants’ school, gets the news about the missile while
  cheerfully demonstrating basketball shots in front of high-schoolers.
  Frantically, the White House staff try to intercept the missile, and in the
  event of failure, must decide if they should not respond in kind, effectively
  sacrifice an American city with millions of lives and risk appeasing the
  aggressor or launch a retaliation and risk world war three – or even gamble
  that the missile will not detonate. And they can’t decide if this is a rogue
  launch from the North Koreans or another nuclear power, born of a fanatical
  desperation that no one has guessed at. This unknowing, this chaos, operating
  outside the long understood tradition of mutually assured destruction between
  two sides is what the film suggests will be the origin of a new war. Bigelow’s
  movie has the classic personae from what might be called the nuclear
  apocalypse film: the careworn, grey-haired officials who always guessed it
  might come to this; the smart, hard-working younger staff doing their loyal,
  patriotic best, the utterly unreflective young bomber pilots entrusted with
  delivering the final blow. And all with the sculpted or painted faces of Ike
  and Lincoln in the White House looking impassively down. What the film
  shrewdly shows is the horribly ironic transitional moments: along with the
  heart-stopping intel about the missile, the screens are, at first, still
  showing ordinary news – headlines such as “Rental demand driving up prices”,
  now remnants of a lost world. There are times when A House of Dynamite might
  seem melodramatic or stagey and yet maybe that is how it may well feel in the
  highest reaches of power – with everyone looking and feeling like actors in
  elaborate costumes whose roles had only one purpose: to deter aggression, a
  purpose which is now obsolete. It is a big chill.
