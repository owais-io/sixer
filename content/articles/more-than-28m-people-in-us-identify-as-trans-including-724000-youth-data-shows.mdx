  More than 2.8 million people now identify as transgender in the US, including
  an estimated 724,000 youth, according to a new data analysis that is the
  largest of its kind to date. Researchers from the University of California,
  Los Angeles (UCLA) Williams Institute used federal surveys and data from state
  health agencies to identify the size and demographics of the trans population
  in each state. The analysis, shared with the Guardian and released on
  Wednesday, documented thousands of trans youth living in all 50 states and the
  District of Columbia. The findings counter Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts
  to deny the existence of trans minors, as his administration removes
  references to trans people across federal agencies and widely erodes
  protections and programs for LGBTQ+ communities. The report builds on federal
  data collection efforts that the White House is now eliminating. The authors
  warn their study could be the last comprehensive portrait of the nation’s
  trans population for a decade or more as trans people are erased from vital US
  surveys, including health reports and crime data analyses. The Williams
  Institute primarily relied on data from 2021 to 2023 from Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC) surveys and records disclosed by state health
  agencies. Some of the key findings include: 1% of the total US population ages
  13 and older identifies as trans, including 0.8% of adults (more than 2.1
  million people) and 3.3% of youth ages 13 to 17 (roughly 724,000 people).
  Young adults ages 18 to 24 are significantly more likely to identify as trans
  (2.72%) than those 35 to 64 (0.42%) and those 65 and older (0.26%). Of the 2.1
  million trans adults, 32.7% (698,500) are trans women, 34.2% (730,500) are
  trans men and 33.1% (707,100) are trans non-binary people. The trans
  populations are fairly consistent across regions, with 0.9% of adults in the
  west, midwest and north-east identifying as trans, compared with 0.7% of
  adults in the south. Minnesota had the highest rate of adults who identify as
  trans (1.2%), and Hawaii had the highest rate of trans youth (3.6%), though
  the ranges were similar across states. “Trans people live everywhere and are
  represented in every state,” said Dr Jody Herman, senior scholar of public
  policy at the Williams Institute and co-author of the report, noting the total
  US trans population was greater than the individual populations of more than a
  dozen states. “This is a substantial population that has unique concerns and
  barriers to getting their needs met, and lawmakers need to keep that in mind.”
  The Williams Institute, a leading LGBTQ+ policy research center, has published
  national trans population counts since its 2011 report, which was the first of
  its kind as state-level data on gender identity became available. The
  estimates are considered the best available data and were cited by the US
  supreme court in its recent majority opinion upholding Tennessee’s ban on
  trans youth healthcare. The quality and sources of the researchers’ data have
  improved from one report to the next, the researchers said, making it
  difficult to assess changes over time. But the researchers noted that the
  overall estimates of trans adults have remained relatively steady, while the
  latest data shows how younger people are now significantly more likely to
  identify as trans than older groups. There are many factors contributing to
  youth identifying as trans at higher rates, including that younger people are
  more likely to answer these kinds of survey questions, said Dr Andrew Flores,
  Williams Institute distinguished visiting scholar and associate professor of
  government at American University. “Younger people are growing up among other
  younger people who already hold more accepting attitudes toward LGBT and
  transgender people more broadly,” said Flores, a report co-author, citing
  increasingly visible signs of support, such as student walkouts in Florida in
  protest of anti-trans policies. “In this generation, they might be more
  willing and safe to identify that they are transgender, because they don’t see
  as much of a harm or threat as older generations.” While some conservatives
  and anti-trans advocates have presented a reported rise in trans youth as a
  “social contagion”, suggesting youth are copying their peers, “the growth
  comes as people are now in an environment that allows them to fully express
  who they are,” Flores said. Shifting language also affects generational
  differences, he said, noting how older groups were more likely to identify as
  lesbian or gay while younger people are more likely to identify as bisexual or
  pansexual. And while older trans people are more likely to identify as men or
  women, younger trans people more frequently identify as non-binary. The report
  also found that the race and ethnicity of trans people was largely similar to
  broader US demographics, with Indigenous, Latino and multiracial adults
  slightly more likely to identify as trans than other groups. The Trump
  administration, which has widely attacked data collection efforts across
  government, has moved to remove trans identity questions from two critical CDC
  behavioral health surveys and from Department of Justice surveys on crime
  victimization and sexual violence. The US Census Bureau has also taken steps
  to exclude gender identity from multiple surveys, according to the former
  director who resigned in February. Those efforts followed Trump’s day-one
  executive order “restoring biological truth” to the government, which
  suggested that trans identity was “false” and directed the state department to
  deny trans people accurate passports. The data loss will make it impossible
  for the Williams Institute to continue its analyses in their current form, and
  even if the next administration restored the surveys, the public would still
  be losing up to 10 years of data, which would be a devastating erosion of
  knowledge, the researchers said. “We didn’t really have decent national data
  until around 10 years ago, so we just very recently got a grasp on how many
  people identify as trans in the US and what their characteristics are,” said
  Herman. “For these data sources to just suddenly disappear, it is a major
  setback. The population is not going to go away; we’re just not going to know
  more about them than what we have from our current sources.” The data has
  frequently been cited by journalists, school boards, public health experts,
  civil rights lawyers, advocates fighting discriminatory legislation and
  lawmakers expanding trans rights. The researchers had hoped federal data could
  help illuminate how trans people were moving within the US as some have fled
  red states due to anti-trans laws, but that will be hard to track without
  national surveys, they said. “In some policy circles, they say if you can’t be
  counted, you don’t count,” Flores added. “And for members of the LGBTQ+
  community, to be able to see numbers that reflect their lived experiences is
  quite important.” Imara Jones, founder of news organization TransLash Media,
  said there was no easy fix for the loss of national data backed by federal
  resources. “It is meant to erase, and that erasure is meant to have real-world
  impacts, making it harder for people to be who they are,” Jones said. Flores
  said the institute and others were discussing ways to fill the gaps and
  continue data collection without the federal government: “We’re not just going
  to close up shop. We’re going to try to find a way to keep telling these
  stories and be persistent.”
