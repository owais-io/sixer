  A Road to a Village review – striking visuals ballast Nepal drama of haves and
  have-nots

  If an interest in realism is a bellwether for a film industry’s relationship
  with social conditions in a given country, it’s always instructive to see
  where notable examples of the genre crop up. After 2012’s Wadjda prefigured
  the opening up of Saudi Arabia, here is a fretful example from Nepal,
  resplendently shot in the vast mountainsides above the eastern city of Dharan,
  but which agonises about the country’s modernisation. Weaver Maila (Dayahang
  Rai) finds himself on the wrong side of progress after a road is built
  connecting the Rai village of Balankha to the valley below. With plastic tarps
  on sale at a local store now bursting with hot new merch, no one wants his
  bamboo mats any more. His electricity is cut off, stopping his scallywag son
  Bindray (Prasan Rai) from studying, and driving the youngster to instead
  obsess over other modern distractions: the elixir of Coca-Cola, which he uses
  to bolster his playground credentials, and the neighbours’ new TV, which ups
  their standing. Under pressure from his wife Maili (Pashupati Rai), Maila
  accepts the store-owner’s proposal to bootleg millet wine for sale down in the
  city so he can use the money to match the neighbours’ home-entertainment
  setup. Director Nabin Subba, with only his third film in 25 years, initially
  tells his story of haves and have-nots in airily comic bursts. He makes
  effective contrast between the browbeaten Maili and the blithely unrepentant
  Bindray, who is always cutting school with (in his new shades) an increasingly
  gangsta swagger. But there is true underlying pain in how the supposed salve
  of progress works to divide communities, forcing some abroad for money and
  others, like Maila, into increasingly desperate schemes. After the brewing
  goes awry, he’s bailed out by the village elders: a reminder of the feudal
  hierarchy underlying the new capitalist economy, and of the upper ranks lining
  up for their share of it. American cinematographer Josh Herum gives this
  humble parable a mythic grandeur, the closeups of the family filled with a
  radiant familiarity, and sometimes peering past them down vertiginous
  mountainsides, so to emphasise vast social precipices opening up in the
  country. These confident aesthetics only waver during a sudden final turn into
  tragedy – some corny montaging is needed to stoke the melodrama. Otherwise,
  this is a robust look at the costs of breakneck modernisation that has you
  rooting for the stragglers and casualties. • A Road to a Village is in UK
  cinemas from 22 August.
