  Whether you enjoy an aromatic bar with notes of caramel or something less
  fancy, chocolate can have many tastes. Now researchers say they have shed
  fresh light on a key ingredient that could open the door to new flavours. They
  claim to have unpicked how and why the bacteria and fungi involved in the
  fermentation of cocoa beans influence the flavour of chocolate. “We understand
  now what microbes we need and what they’re doing. And I think that opens up
  the opportunity … to be a lot more directed [about] how we make our chocolate
  in terms of its flavour,” said Prof David Salt, co-author of the work from the
  University of Nottingham. Writing in the journal Nature Microbiology, the team
  report how they studied beans fermented at cocoa farms in three different
  regions of Colombia – Santander, Huila and Antioquia. The researchers found
  that while the fermentation process was similar for the Santander and Huila
  farms, the beans at the Antioquia farm showed different temperature and pH
  patterns, which was most probably down to the presence and activity of a
  different group of microbes. Further research revealed that while cocoa liquor
  made from the beans at Santander and Huila farms had fruity, floral, citrus
  notes – similar to the characteristics of a fine flavour cocoa from Madagascar
  – the cocoa liquor made from the beans at Antioquia lacked the fruity, floral,
  citrus flavours, in some ways resembling the liquor from fermented beans from
  the Ivory Coast and Ghana that are used in bulk chocolate production. The team
  then used genetic sequencing to identify the microbes involved in cocoa bean
  fermentation from multiple sites in Colombia and beyond, explore the genes
  they contained, and hence identify the flavour substances they could produce
  during fermentation. As a result, the researchers identified nine microbes
  that together were predicted to produce the notes of a fine flavour cocoa.
  They then introduced this community to sterile cocoa beans, and allowed them
  to ferment. The upshot, said Salt, was a cocoa with floral, fruity and citrus
  notes and a recognisable cocoa flavour but with reduced astringency and
  bitterness. “I call it the secret sauce,” said Salt. He said the findings
  could have a number of applications, including helping cocoa farmers find ways
  to promote the presence of the key microbes during fermentation to ensure they
  can reproduce conditions required for high quality cocoa. It could even help
  with the current crisis in the cost of chocolate, said Salt, suggesting that
  if cocoa farmers were able to produce more flavourful cocoa, less would be
  needed during production. And there was another possibility. “You could bring
  in either inoculums [of microbes] that could bring in particular flavours, new
  flavours that you just don’t see normally in cocoa,” he said. “Or you could
  actually come up with strategies to bias a fermentation, to come up with new
  flavours.”
