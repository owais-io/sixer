  Once, a stranger at a party imparted an invaluable piece of advice to me:
  “There are friends you can travel with and friends you can’t – and you have to
  know the difference.” I have since learned how true this is. I know of
  friendships that almost collapsed because one person wanted to fill each day
  with activities while the other preferred a more relaxed approach. I spent a
  blissful week crisscrossing Italy with a friend whose travel preferences
  exactly overlapped with mine, but argued with another who wanted to go
  clubbing at 2am when I desperately wanted to go to bed. In short, traveling
  with friends is high-risk, high-reward. We want to hear your tales of
  traveling with pals: the good, the bad, the ugly, the bachelor parties.
