  Keir Starmer wants the police to “focus on policing streets and not tweets”,
  Wes Streeting has said, after the co-creator of TV’s Father Ted was arrested
  at Heathrow over three social media posts on transgender issues. Graham
  Linehan, who also created the IT Crowd, said he was intercepted by five armed
  officers after flying in from Arizona and was told he was under arrest over
  the posts. The prime minister’s spokesperson on Tuesday dodged questions over
  whether the police should be focused on arresting people who have posted on
  social media about transgender issues. However, Streeting, the health
  secretary, went further, criticised former Conservative governments for
  “layering more and more expectation on the police”, saying it “diluted” their
  focus on the public’s priorities. “Well, as the prime minister and the home
  secretary have been clear, we want the police to focus on policing streets
  rather than tweets,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It’s very easy
  for people to criticise the police but the thing we are always mindful of as a
  government that backs the police to keep us safe, is that the police are there
  to enforce the laws that we as parliament legislate for.” He added: “So if
  over the years with good intentions parliament has layered more and more
  expectation on the police and diluted the focus and priorities of the public,
  that is obviously something we need to look at.” JK Rowling labelled the
  arrest was “totalitarianism” and “deplorable”. Conservative MPs described it
  as “ridiculous” and accused the police of “arresting people for making jokes”,
  and Elon Musk described Britain as a “police state”. Streeting, who refused to
  criticise the police, said he is “proud” to live in a country that comes down
  “like a tonne of bricks on racism, discrimination … that is the right thing to
  do”. But he said the boundaries can be blurred “sometimes” and that it was
  difficult for the police “because they have to apply the law as it is written
  not the law as sometimes it was intended”. The health secretary indicated this
  discussion on police priorities, in relation to policing social media, is one
  of nuance and “shades of grey” rather than “than black and white”, as he
  rejected the idea that free speech has been “banned”. “When it comes to
  speech, context is king,” he added. “We do have to I think as legislators
  think really carefully when it comes to boundaries of free speech. Speaking
  more explicitly on how the law could be changed, Streeting told Sky News: “One
  of the things the home secretary is looking at is, are we tasking the police,
  are we asking the police to focus on the right things? “And if we’ve
  distracted [them] as parliament under the previous government, if they’ve been
  distracted, being asked to do things we don’t see as a priority, that is
  something we will deal with.” Linehan is to appear at Westminster magistrates
  court on Thursday accused of harassing the transgender woman Sophia Brooks and
  damaging her phone, which he denies. For the posts he wrote on X, he was
  arrested on suspicion of inciting violence. Shami Chakrabarti called for an
  “overarching review” in speech offences. The Labour peer and former Liberty
  director told the BBC “the statute book has exploded”, with “vague,
  duplicative and unclear laws, not understood by the public or even some of the
  police”. “Sometimes people are looking for security by overseeking security
  through policing rather than thinking about how we can all contribute to
  keeping the peace – we’ve become intolerant,” Chakrabarti added. “I would like
  to see a review of the statute book, but inciting violence even if you say
  you’re being comical, to be talking about assaulting a group of people who you
  don’t like, is something worth looking at now.” The former director of public
  prosecutions Sir Max Hill backed Chakrabarti’s calls for a review, saying it
  was ultimately “parliament’s job”, adding: “It would undoubtedly help the
  lawyers and the police to have as clear a steer as they can possibly be
  given.” Rejecting suggestions of “totalitarianism”, Hill added: “As for
  Linehan, it’s difficult to comment on his manner of arrest, but it’s an
  arrest, the police act on reasonable suspicion. They don’t act only on guilt.
  So it’s highly likely the Crown Prosecution Service haven’t even been given
  the chance to consider whether that gentleman has crossed the line or not.”
  Nigel Farage is expected to raise Linehan’s case while giving evidence to the
  US House judiciary committee in Washington and say Britain has become an
  “authoritarian censorship regime”. The new leader of the Green party, Zack
  Polanski, told Newsnight the posts were “totally unacceptable” and Linehan’s
  arrest seemed “proportionate”.
