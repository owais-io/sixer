  England should “get everyone started” across their 32-player Rugby World Cup
  squad in their opening two games, says the head coach, John Mitchell, who all
  but confirmed there will be a raft of changes to the Red Roses matchday XV to
  face Samoa next Saturday. The news came after the Red Roses’ thumping win
  against the USA with Emma Sing and Sarah Bern among the players not to start a
  match and former captain Marlie Packer among those not yet involved in a
  matchday squad. Those stars are now more than likely to start the game with
  Mitchell saying: “We have planned our teams for the early part of the
  tournament. “Obviously the unpredicted niggles, we have to account for that
  but we will get everyone started by the end of next week which has been our
  plan. Hopefully we are able to execute that.” England were forced to adapt
  this week with versatile back Helena Rowland rolling her ankle in the
  build-up. Mitchell had said earlier in the week she should be available for
  Samoa, along with the injured Claudia Moloney-MacDonald and Holly Aitchison,
  but he gave a positive update on Rowland. “I was with the girls this morning
  that were not selected and they trained very, very well,” Mitchell added. “The
  girls that played [on Friday] would have been really proud of them and Helena
  was in that training session. She got through that really well.” There was
  more positive news for the England camp as captain Zoe Aldcroft confirmed she
  was okay after strapping her knee in the first half and being substituted in
  the second 40 against the USA. The game was the perfect start for England in
  terms of the result but the performance was not completely up to standards.
  The USA captain Kate Zackary picked out some of the Red Roses weaknesses,
  saying: “They have done it for a lot longer than a lot of us, they have had a
  rugby ball in their hands longer. But what we can do is bring that physicality
  and when you saw us bringing intensity in defence you saw them make mistakes,
  you saw them kick away possession. “You can’t keep anyone on a pedestal when
  you get to a World Cup, that is one of the most important takeaways here. We
  play these players individually at their clubs in the PWR and now we see them
  as a team who are collectively very good but they all have weaknesses, don’t
  they?”
