  … before Altmaier misses a second set point … and takes the breaker 9-7 on his
  third. Just as Venus Williams continues her doubles run with a straight-sets
  win alongside Leylah Fernandez in the second round. The crowd are cheering as
  if the 45-year-old has won the singles title. She’s smiling as if she has too.
  It’s time to wrap up our live coverage now, but do join us again tomorrow.
  Same time, same place. Bye! On Court 17, De Minaur and Altmaier are locked at
  six games all and five points all in the first-set tie-break. Demon then does
  what Demon does, staying in the rally, scrapping, scrambling, but Altmaier
  eventually brings up set point with a forehand winner. And, crucially, the set
  point is on his serve. De Minaur decides to take matters into his own hands,
  charging forward and putting away the volley. So it’s 6-6 at the change of
  ends … Wong holds, so Rublev is serving for the match. From 15-all, with the
  early evening shadows stretching over Grandstand, Rublev puts Wong in the
  shade for 30-15. But Wong absolutely crushes a return winner and it’s 30-all!
  Wong can’t repeat the trick on the next point, so Rublev has match point. And
  Wong whacks into the net. The qualifier’s run is over, Rublev is into the last
  16, and the Russian has now won eight of his past 10 five-setters. That’s an
  impressive stat for a player who can be up and down emotionally. Ruvlev grabs
  the first break in the fifth set as he moves to 4-2. For all of his ability,
  he’s still searching for a first slam semi-final, having reached the
  quarter-finals in New York four times. His link-up with Marat Safin seems to
  have mellowed him a little, and he’s had a decent US summer swing, but he’s
  shouting at himself as he’s taken to deuce, before settling the game with an
  ace. He’s a game away at 5-2. Wong has taken it to a decider! The qualifier
  and grand slam debutant has won the fourth set 6-4 against Rublev. De Minaur v
  Altmaier is going on serve early on, with Altmaier 4-3 ahead. A very
  relieved-looking Sinner speaks: Very tough match today. The last time we
  played was some years ago, we’ve both improved so much, I knew I’d have to
  play at a very high level. I tried to stay there mentally. Let’s see what’s
  coming, but obviously I’m very happy to be in the second week. Sinner, serving
  for the match, stumbles on the opening point at Shapovalov smacks a winner.
  Sinner comes back for 15-all, but a draining duel ends in Shapovalov’s favour
  and it’s 15-30! He hasn’t won a rally like that in a while. He cheaply
  concedes the next point, though, and it’s 30-all. Then Sinner shanks a
  forehand and it’s break point! Sinner saves it with an unreturned serve, wins
  the next point too, and from break point it’s now match point. Sinner gets
  over the line when Shapovalov chops long. It’s been anything but comfortable
  today, but perhaps it’ll sharpen him up for the challenges ahead. The numero
  uno is into the last 16, where he’ll meet the winner of the night match
  between Tommy Paul and Alexander Bublik. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. At least
  Shapovalov gives Sinner something to think about. Shapovalov saves a break
  point at 4-1 down but is probably just delaying the inevitable. Sinner is now
  smacking the ball with his relentlessly metronomic power and precision, and he
  holds to love for 5-2. So Shapovalov must now hold to inconvenience the
  defending champ any longer. Munar’s straight-sets victory over Bergs has set
  up a last-16 contest with Musetti, and it means his near-namesake, De Minaur,
  is now on court against Daniel Altmaier, the German who so enraged Stefanos
  Tsitsipas with his underarm serves in the last round. De Minaur is the last
  Australian standing in the singles after Kasatkina’s loss to Osaka.
  Shapovalov’s chance appears to have gone. He’s already 3-0 down in the fourth
  set. That’s nine games in a row against him. Though he does give himself
  something to build on when he holds for 3-1. Keeping up his level from the
  first and second sets was always going to be tough, especially with his brand
  of high-risk tennis, but his body language now is not good. He doesn’t look as
  if he believes he can turn this around. And he’s sarcastically giving the
  thumbs up to his box. Sinner holds to 15 for 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 4-1. Osaka’s win
  means that Venus Williams’s doubles match has moved on to a rowdy Louis
  Armstrong. The 45-year-old, playing with Canada’s Leylah Fernandez, is up
  against Norway’s Ulrikke Eikeri and Japan’s Eri Hozumi. It’s a second-round
  meeting, after Williams won her first women’s doubles match at the US Open in
  more than a decade on Thursday. Jelena Ostapenko has apologised after her row
  with Taylor Townsend: On Grandstand, Rublev is now two sets to one up against
  Wong, leading 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. And if you haven’t already seen it, this
  documentary on the Russian’s search for a new outlook on life and tennis is
  well worth watching. Sinner pulls off the great escape, holding and breaking
  once more to take six games on the spin – and the third set 6-3. Sinner set up
  the break with a superb backhand winner around the net post. And Shapovalov
  has left the court. Which his team are probably quite relieved about, because
  it means they’ll get a brief respite from him chuntering at them. Sinner
  holds, before Shapovalov coughs up consecutive double faults to give Sinner
  three break points! Sinner can’t take a single one, but then shows ridiculous
  powers of retrieval to stay in the point and get himself a fourth break point.
  Shapovalov surrenders with another double. And then screams at his coach. I
  think he has only himself to blame there. Sinner, from 3-0 down, leads 4-3
  with the break. A word on Osaka’s landmark win. It’s been quite a journey for
  her to get back into the second week of a slam, you could see what it meant to
  her in her post-match celebrations and interview, and she’ll be so relieved to
  pull off a tight victory having had some gut-wrenching three-set defeats at
  slams. Next up is a box-office meeting with Coco Gauff, whom she says she
  views as a “younger sister” in her on-court interview. She’s also asked about
  the latest Labubu attached to her bag. After Billie Jean Bling and Arthur
  Flashe, this one is also a tribute to BJK and is apparently called
  la-billie-bu (geddit?). It’s good to see her having fun out there. Sinner,
  after replacing his shoe lace, gets himself a break point. He can’t take it,
  but soon he has another at his advantage. Shapovalov pulls off a classic
  one-two punch, striking deep to Sinner’s forehand, and Sinner nets. Deuce. But
  here’s a third break point. And this time Shapovalov misfires! Somehow Sinner
  has dragged himself back on to serve, despite appearing all out of sorts, and
  he trails 3-2. One piece of housekeeping: Kostyuk has come through against
  Parry after two and a half hours, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, and will play Muchova next.
  After breaking a string, Sinner now breaks a shoelace and has to stop
  mid-game. It’s all going against him. Shapovalov still leads 7-5, 4-6, 3-1.
  Thanks Tom. This is head-scratching from Sinner. He’s probably hit more
  unforced errors in this match than he has the rest of the year. Credit to
  Shapovalov, though, who isn’t letting up with his high-risk game. The
  26-year-old hasn’t quite hit the heights in his career that were once
  predicted for him – injuries certainly haven’t helped – but the 2020
  quarter-finalist is showing what he’s capable of here. Katy is back from her
  break and will see things through until the conclusion of the day seven live
  blog. Night all. At 0-30 down Sinner breaks a run of seven straight points won
  in a row by Shapovalov and manages to get it to 30-all, but then a backhand
  goes wide to cough up another break point. A backhand into the net offers
  Sinner a reprieve and a big forehand on the next point allows the number one
  seed to come in to seal it at the net. Sinner holds on the back of a
  well-placed serve. He needed that, Shapovalov leads 3-1 in the third. After
  taking the second, Sinner is already in a battle for the third. Shapovalov won
  the first two games and goes 3-0 up with an easy forehand winner into the open
  court. On Grandstand, Rublev has a secured a break in the second and Wong is
  currently serving to stay in the set, with the score at 5-3 to the Russian.
  Osaka is now on her deepest run at a major since winning the Australian Open
  in 2021. Kasatkina has to battle through her service but despite dropping two
  double-faults she manages to hold. Osaka is now serving for the match, with a
  5-3 lead in the third. After the shock of losing the first set, Sinner has
  quickly got himself on terms. He sews up the second set with a rapid-fire hold
  to love. We’re all square after two sets, Sinner 5-7, 6-4 Shapovalov. Sinner
  is serving for the set against Shapovalov… Osaka looks confident as she twice
  works her way up the court to hit forehand winners. She earns a swift service
  hold when a powerful serve can only be returned high and wide. Kasatkina will
  now serve to stay in the match, Osaka leads 5-2. No issues for Kasatkina this
  time on serve. She holds to love and it’s 4-2 to Osaka. This time it’s Osaka’s
  turn to serve an ill-timed double-fault to cough up a break point. The error
  doesn’t last long in the memory and the next two points are of the highest
  quality as Osaka wears down Kasatkina to set up two piercing backhand winners,
  one cross-court, the other down the line. Osaka goes 4-1 up with another
  winner cross-court. Sinner was able to hold serve to go up 5-3 and Shapovalov
  is serving to stay in the set at 3-5 down. Kasatkina has picked the wrong time
  to serve a double fault and when she dumps a forehand into the net Osaka had
  two break points. A baseline rally ends with Kasatkina going long, it’s
  advantage Osaka in the third she leads 3-1. Sinner has broken Shapovalov in
  the second set of their match and is serving to consolidate a 4-3 advantage.
  Hello, first update from me: Wong has won the first set against Rublev 6-2.
  Osaka and Kasatkina remains on serve in the third set, the Japanese player
  leads 2-1. Another hold apiece and Shapovalov is 7-5, 3-2 up on serve.
  Sinner’s body language doesn’t look great. Tom is here to guide you through
  the next stages – I’ll be back in a bit … Osaka shakes off the disappointment
  of losing that second set as she bosses a hold to love at the start of the
  third. She’s often too hard on herself, which can cause her to lose clarity
  during points, so she needs to go easy on herself here. Elsewhere, Parry and
  Kostyuk are also into a decider, Munar is two sets to love up on Bergs and
  Coleman Wong, the 21-year-old qualifier from Hong Kong who’s making his slam
  debut, has a surprise 5-2 lead against Andrey Rublev. There’s no let-up from
  Shapovalov at the start of the second set. He’s still taking it to Sinner,
  who’s looking rather rattled with a couple of mis-timed shots. Sinner slumped
  two sets to love down against Grigor Dimitrov in the Wimbledon fourth round,
  before being rescued by Dimitrov’s injury retirement – could he be in danger
  of dropping two sets behind here too? Shapovalov leads 2-1 on serve. Kasatkina
  has set points at 0-6, 5-4, 40-15. A lengthy rally plays out … Osaka
  eventually pulls the trigger … and Kasatkina thwacks into the tramlines. And
  the Australian then goes long! Deuce. Which is followed by set point No 3.
  Kasatkina’s first serve is well wide, but she makes her second, and Osaska
  nets the return! After the most topsy-turvy of sets (and matches), Kasatkina
  has taken this third-round match to a decider. But just as Osaka has the
  victory line in her sights, Kasatkina breaks, and will serve for the second
  set at 5-4! Though the rate at which these two have been breaking each other
  in this set, there are no guarantees she’ll see the next game through. Osaka
  tosses her racket at her bench in disgust. Osaka is riding the wave now,
  holding and then getting to 0-30 on Kasatkina’s serve with her 20th winner of
  the day. And a 10th double fault from Kasatkina makes it 0-40! Osaka breaks to
  love and from 4-1 down she’s level at 4-4. And possibly two games away from
  her first last-16 slam appearance since winning the Australian Open in 2021.
  Sinner, once again serving to stay in the opener, starts inauspiciously with a
  double fault. He draws level at 30-all, but an inside-out forehand winner from
  Shapovalov, set up by an excellent backhand return, means the 27th seed has a
  set point! And 24,000 spectators gasp as the defending champion and world No 1
  doubles again! Shapovalov has snatched the first set 7-5! Osaka stops the rot,
  breaking to 30. But, at 4-2 down, she’s still got to get another break back.
  Sinner, now very much in the ascendancy, gets a break point at 30-40.
  Shapovalov may be wondering if his chance has gone in this first set. But he
  gamely holds from there and seals the game with an ace. He’s got himself at
  least a tie-break. And there’s been a crazy turnaround on Louis Armstrong,
  where Osaka, having zipped through the first set 6-0, is 4-1 down to Kasatkina
  in the second. Shapovalov isn’t happy at the changeover, telling the umpire
  he’s never been called for a foot fault in his life. Sinner swiftly holds.
  It’s 5-5. And Shapovalov needs to quickly regroup. Shapovalov does actually
  have a winning head-to-head against Sinner. But his one victory came back in
  2021, before Sinner turned into a cyborg, so we shouldn’t read too much into
  that. He gives Sinner a glimmer at 0-30, but a punchy serve down the T makes
  it 15-30. He’d love a few more of those. The pair go at each other cross-court
  in a lung-busting point, Sinner’s backhand to the lefty Shapovalov’s forehand
  … Sinner draws Shapovalov in with the drop shot … and then finishes his
  opponent off with the lob! 15-40, two break points. Shapovalov is called for a
  foot fault … before Sinner wins the rally from the second serve. They’re back
  on serve. As if it was ever going to go another way. Sinner is serving to stay
  in the first set. Not something I was expecting to write before this match
  started. He’s 5-2 down against Shapovalov, and he then gives the Canadian a
  head start by dropping 0-30 down. Shapovalov errs on the next two points, so
  it’s 30-all. Then, off-balance, Shapovalov hits his overhead well long. Sinner
  holds from there, after a point of real quality, but Shapovalov will now serve
  for the opening set. A flick of the wrist from Osaka and a perfect lob lands
  right on the baseline. She leads 5-0, 15-30 on Kasatkina’s serve. And that
  becomes 15-40, two set points. And Osaka nails a forehand return winner down
  the line! They do make a good bagel in New York and Osaka has just served one
  up to her befuddled opponent. Shapovalov backs up the break for 4-1. Sinner
  settles a bit for 4-2. And Karolina Muchova has finally got the better of her
  fellow Czech Linda Noskova, coming from a set down to prevail 6-2 in the
  third. The 2023 and 2024 semi-finalist will next play Parry or Kostyuk, with
  Parry 6-3 up in that one. Kasatkina is still flailing on serve. The double
  fault count is already at seven. Her problem is she likes to use a kick serve
  on her second serve, but that would sit up into Osaka’s strike zone, so she’s
  trying something different and it isn’t working. Osaka breaks again, this time
  from deuce, and it’s now 4-zip. And look here, a break point for Shapovalov!
  He leads 2-1 and 30-40 on Sinner’s serve. Shapovalov smacks a forehand down
  the line and Sinner surrenders his serve for the first time this tournament.
  Just nine minutes played and Osaka leads 3-0. It’s good to see the 2018 and
  2020 champion playing with freedom again; she’s won eight of her past nine
  matches since linking up with Tomasz Wiktorowski, the former coach of Iga
  Swiatek, with the only blip being her Montreal final defeat by Victoria Mboko.
  Victory today would put her into the second week of a slam for the first time
  since the birth of her daughter in 2023. It’s a love hold apiece for Sinner
  and Shapovalov. And a love hold for Osaka, before she’s handed the break when
  Kasatkina hits b2b double faults. Osaka leads 2-0. In important news: Osaka’s
  purple crystal-covered day ensemble gets a second outing, after her orange
  night version in the first round. Kasatkina, the last remaining Australian
  woman in the singles after she switched allegiance from Russia this year, is
  also wearing purple, but she isn’t bedazzled. Sinner and Shapovalov are
  warming up on Arthur Ashe, as are Naomi Osaka and Daria Kasatkina on Louis
  Armstrong. I’m looking forward to these two matches – though Sinner’s form in
  New York so far suggests Shapovalov could be swiftly dispatched. At best, I’d
  give the Canadian 27th seed one set. He does love the big stage though and is
  a flashy but inconsistent player (the exact opposite of Sinner you could say).
  Muchova and Noskova are into a deciding set. Munar (now with the distinction
  of being the highest-ranked Mallorcan in men’s tennis) and Bergs (who
  definitely doesn’t have the distinction of being the most famous Zizou in
  sport) are just getting started. And France’s Diane Parry is 5-3 ahead against
  Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk, who blows so hot and cold but is the favourite in
  that match despite the scoreline. Martina Navratilova and Laura Robson are
  giving Gauff a B+ for today’s performance. I’d go with that. Gauff could face
  Osaka next. Yes please! Osaka will soon get under way against Daria Kasatkina.
  “I thought today I played well,” she says. “Overall I’m really happy. It’s
  been an emotional week but I needed those tough moments to move forward. I had
  fun out there. I’m so privileged to walk on to this court and have your
  support.” Which won’t be very long, because Gauff is ripping through the games
  now, leading 6-3, 5-1 and 0-30 on Frech’s serve. Make that 0-40, three match
  points. Gauff whacks long on the first. And Frech hits long on the second!
  That was a gutsy performance from Gauff after her woes the other night. She
  was crying in her post-match interview then; it’s good to see the smile’s now
  back. It’s going to be incredibly hard for her to win this tournament while
  remodelling that serve, but right now what matters is she’s into the last 16
  for the fourth straight year. Up next for Musetti: Spain’s Jaume Munar or
  Belgium’s Zizou Bergs. And it could be the most famous Italian of them all in
  the quarter-finals. And speaking of Sinner, he’ll be on after Gauff v Frech.
  It’s the second time in two days a player has had to retire after diving for a
  shot on the hard courts, after Ben Shelton had to call it quits against Adrian
  Mannarino yesterday. Maybe someone should quietly remind the players this
  isn’t grass. Sighs on Louis Armstrong, and muted celebrations for Musetti, as
  Cobolli retires while trailing his great friend 6-3, 6-2, 2-0 because of that
  wrist injury. So Musetti is through to the fourth round for the first time –
  but he wouldn’t have wanted it to happen like this. “I didn’t want to finish
  like that, especially against Flavio. He’s my best friend on tour, we’ve known
  each other since we were nine years old. So a big round of applause for Flavio
  please. It’s a bittersweet match.” On Thursday night Gauff was shaking at the
  changeovers as she battled against her own serve. Now, she’s skipping back to
  her chair after breaking Frech for a 6-3, 2-1 lead. She then comes out on top
  in an attritional rally for 30-all on her serve. She then turns in Carlos
  Alcaraz with a showreel worthy forehand slice winner! The crowd liked that.
  Frech then misfires and Gauff is in command at 6-3, 3-1. Cobolli, by the way,
  has had the physio on three times for a wrist injury, which he suffered during
  the second set while diving for a volley. To make matters worse, he’s just
  been broken at the start of the third set too. Musetti is serving for a two
  sets to love lead. It’s not going as smoothly as the rest of the match for the
  French Open semi-finalist, as Cobolli gets two chances to break. But here’s a
  set point for Musetti, as he chases down the drop shot … but he knifes a
  backhand slice into the tramlines. A second set point comes his way … and this
  time Cobolli clunks at his backhand. Musetti leads 6-3, 6-2 and is a set away
  from breaking new ground by reaching the last 16. Gauff, her serving arm
  looking a little more relaxed, despite an aborted ball toss, brings up two set
  points at 40-15. A cross-court forehand battle ensues … and Frech finally
  prods long! Gauff, after surviving that mid-set wobble, secures the set 6-3.
  And one stat that few would have predicted before the match: she’s managed to
  land 79% of her first serves so far. Game eight is turning into a real tussle
  between Gauff and Frech, and it has the feeling of perhaps being the decisive
  game of this first set. From deuce, Gauff has her third break point … and she
  takes it! Arthur Ashe – which is as full as I’ve ever seen it at this time of
  day – rises. The American will serve for the opening set at 5-3 up. The
  tie-break sums up the first set for Muchova. Despite a commanding lead, the
  two-times semi-finalist just can’t shake off Noskova, who comes back from 4-2
  down to snatch the breaker 7-5. … just as Gauff’s shoulders visibly drop as
  Noskova wins her third game on the spin for 3-3. “There are 50,000 things
  going on in Gauff’s head,” says the always excellent Laura Robson. “She’s
  thinking about all the technical aspects. Even her backhand is suspect. It
  seems there’s no confidence in any area of her game apart from her movement,
  which she can always rely on.” I agree – she’s playing in her head, not her
  body, which is not surprising given she’s trying to remodel her serve
  mid-tournament. But it’s hard to watch. But Gauff does, at least, hold for
  4-3. Noskova has won four games on the spin and is serving for the first set.
  But the 20-year-old – nine years younger than her seasoned compatriot – blinks
  with three double faults. So they’re going to a tie-break. Muchova – of which
  there’s so much to like about her game, with her mix of spins and slice –
  leads 4-2 at the change of ends … Frech holds for the first time to reduce her
  arrears to 3-1. On the Sky commentary, Martina Navratilova is asked about
  Gauff looking more comfortable today, and whether she preferred playing during
  the day vs at night during her US Open career. She says she never liked the
  night matches, because the floodlights weren’t so good and it affected her
  volleying, as she thinks it did for Bjorn Borg. And suddenly Gauff throws in a
  few errors, including a first double fault, and she hands the break back to
  Frech. So disappointing for the American after her assured start. She leads
  3-2 but they’re back on serve. Noskova has got the break back against Muchova
  and is serving at 5-4 down. I’m not too sure how she got there; my computer
  isn’t really playing ball and is only letting me watch two matches at once. So
  I’m dipping between that and Musetti v Cobolli. But Muchova did serve for the
  first set at 5-3. Gauff, looking more relaxed than she did the other night
  against Vekic, skips from 0-15 to 0-30 to 0-40 on Frech’s serve. Three early
  break points. And she then drags Frech to one corner and then the other,
  before dispatching the forehand winner. That’ll shake off any nerves. Gauff’s
  got the break and leads 2-0. Musetti has pressed the accelerator on Louis
  Armstrong. From 2-2, he now leads 5-2, and then flashes a forehand pass on his
  way to set point on Cobolli’s serve. Cobolli cooly finds a way to hold. But
  Musetti soon has three set points on his own serve, and he serves out the 6-3
  set to love. He’s the first player with a set to his name on day seven. Gauff,
  the 2023 champion, could also be helped today by the fact that Frech, the
  Polish 28th seed, doesn’t have any stand-out weapons. Even if Gauff’s serve is
  still misfiring, she should be able to swing freely in her return games. That
  said, Frech settles the second point of the match, a 28-shot rally, with a
  piercing winner. Gauff is already stumbling at 0-30 on serve. But Gauff, ever
  the competitor, even when her game isn’t totally clicking, hauls herself up
  and gets to 40-30. Make that game. Gauff was in tears during and after her
  second-round win over Donna Vekic, such were her struggles on serve. Since
  winning the French Open in June she’s been plagued by serving problems and
  resorted to emergency action just before this tournament, splitting with her
  coach Matt Daly and hiring the biomechanist Gavin MacMillan, who previously
  helped Aryna Sabalenka overcome her service yips. But trying to remodel her
  serve under the public scrutiny of nearly 24,000 home fans on Arthur Ashe,
  has, understandably, been incredibly stressful for the 21-year-old. Perhaps
  playing in the day session today, rather than in the primetime night slot,
  will take off a little pressure. And Gauff gets a huge cheer of support as she
  arrives on court, even though the stands are nowhere near full. Musetti and
  Cobolli are still going on serve at 2-2. And despite another double fault,
  Noskova gets herself on the board with a hold to 30, finishing things off with
  a forehand winner. She trails 3-1. Coco Gauff, meanwhile, is about to step on
  to Arthur Ashe, so we’ll be focusing on that match once it gets going. And if
  you want to catch up on yesterday’s play, here are our reports: Do remember!
  You can get in touch with any chat. It’s always good to hear from you.
  Cobolli, who reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals last month at his
  breakthrough grand slam, withstands the pressure from his higher-ranked
  opponent and holds. It’s 1-1. Muchova, who’s made the last four in New York
  for the past two years, breaks when Noskova double faults and then makes a
  hash of her smash. It’s 2-0. It’s 11.21am in New York, the sun is shining and
  already under way are two internal conflicts, between the Italian friends
  Musetti and Cobolli and the Czech mates Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova.
  Musetti has taken the opening game on serve and is pushing for a break on
  Cobolli’s serve, while it’s a similar story for Muchova, who leads 1-0 and has
  just had a break point. Hello! And welcome to our coverage of the US Open day
  seven. Such has been the dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz over
  the past two years, it’s almost possible to have sudden amnesia for all that
  the Big Three managed to achieve before the Big Two came along. Having carved
  up the past seven grand slam titles between them, they’re now seemingly
  hurtling towards a third consecutive major final against each other, yet to
  drop a set – and after Alcaraz’s latest breeze yesterday, it’s now Sinner’s
  turn to remind everyone that there are two kings of New York, as the defending
  champion takes on Canada’s Denis Shapovalov for a place in the last 16. Sinner
  is second on Arthur Ashe in the day session, after Coco Gauff puts her shaky
  serve through another round of intense scrutiny, this time against Poland’s
  Magdalena Frech. On Louis Armstrong it’s an all-Italian affair between Lorenzo
  Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, before what could be another cracker, as Naomi
  Osaka and her countless crystals take on Daria Kasatkina. Elsewhere we’ve got
  Alex de Minaur, Andrey Rublev, the whitewashed Wimbledon finalist Amanda
  Anisimova, plus Venus Williams, 96, in the women’s doubles. Play gets going:
  straight away. Don’t go anywhere!

… before Altmaier misses a second set point … and takes the breaker 9-7 on his third. Just as Venus Williams continues her doubles run with a straight-sets win alongside Leylah Fernandez in the second round. The crowd are cheering as if the 45-year-old has won the singles title. She’s smiling as if she has too. It’s time to wrap up our live coverage now, but do join us again tomorrow. Same time, same place. Bye! On Court 17, De Minaur and Altmaier are locked at six games all and five points all in the first-set tie-break. Demon then does what Demon does, staying in the rally, scrapping, scrambling, but Altmaier eventually brings up set point with a forehand winner. And, crucially, the set point is on his serve. De Minaur decides to take matters into his own hands, charging forward and putting away the volley. So it’s 6-6 at the change of ends … Wong holds, so Rublev is serving for the match. From 15-all, with the early evening shadows stretching over Grandstand, Rublev puts Wong in the shade for 30-15. But Wong absolutely crushes a return winner and it’s 30-all! Wong can’t repeat the trick on the next point, so Rublev has match point. And Wong whacks into the net. The qualifier’s run is over, Rublev is into the last 16, and the Russian has now won eight of his past 10 five-setters. That’s an impressive stat for a player who can be up and down emotionally. Ruvlev grabs the first break in the fifth set as he moves to 4-2. For all of his ability, he’s still searching for a first slam semi-final, having reached the quarter-finals in New York four times. His link-up with Marat Safin seems to have mellowed him a little, and he’s had a decent US summer swing, but he’s shouting at himself as he’s taken to deuce, before settling the game with an ace. He’s a game away at 5-2. Wong has taken it to a decider! The qualifier and grand slam debutant has won the fourth set 6-4 against Rublev. De Minaur v Altmaier is going on serve early on, with Altmaier 4-3 ahead. A very relieved-looking Sinner speaks: Very tough match today. The last time we played was some years ago, we’ve both improved so much, I knew I’d have to play at a very high level. I tried to stay there mentally. Let’s see what’s coming, but obviously I’m very happy to be in the second week. Sinner, serving for the match, stumbles on the opening point at Shapovalov smacks a winner. Sinner comes back for 15-all, but a draining duel ends in Shapovalov’s favour and it’s 15-30! He hasn’t won a rally like that in a while. He cheaply concedes the next point, though, and it’s 30-all. Then Sinner shanks a forehand and it’s break point! Sinner saves it with an unreturned serve, wins the next point too, and from break point it’s now match point. Sinner gets over the line when Shapovalov chops long. It’s been anything but comfortable today, but perhaps it’ll sharpen him up for the challenges ahead. The numero uno is into the last 16, where he’ll meet the winner of the night match between Tommy Paul and Alexander Bublik. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. At least Shapovalov gives Sinner something to think about. Shapovalov saves a break point at 4-1 down but is probably just delaying the inevitable. Sinner is now smacking the ball with his relentlessly metronomic power and precision, and he holds to love for 5-2. So Shapovalov must now hold to inconvenience the defending champ any longer. Munar’s straight-sets victory over Bergs has set up a last-16 contest with Musetti, and it means his near-namesake, De Minaur, is now on court against Daniel Altmaier, the German who so enraged Stefanos Tsitsipas with his underarm serves in the last round. De Minaur is the last Australian standing in the singles after Kasatkina’s loss to Osaka. Shapovalov’s chance appears to have gone. He’s already 3-0 down in the fourth set. That’s nine games in a row against him. Though he does give himself something to build on when he holds for 3-1. Keeping up his level from the first and second sets was always going to be tough, especially with his brand of high-risk tennis, but his body language now is not good. He doesn’t look as if he believes he can turn this around. And he’s sarcastically giving the thumbs up to his box. Sinner holds to 15 for 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 4-1. Osaka’s win means that Venus Williams’s doubles match has moved on to a rowdy Louis Armstrong. The 45-year-old, playing with Canada’s Leylah Fernandez, is up against Norway’s Ulrikke Eikeri and Japan’s Eri Hozumi. It’s a second-round meeting, after Williams won her first women’s doubles match at the US Open in more than a decade on Thursday. Jelena Ostapenko has apologised after her row with Taylor Townsend: On Grandstand, Rublev is now two sets to one up against Wong, leading 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. And if you haven’t already seen it, this documentary on the Russian’s search for a new outlook on life and tennis is well worth watching. Sinner pulls off the great escape, holding and breaking once more to take six games on the spin – and the third set 6-3. Sinner set up the break with a superb backhand winner around the net post. And Shapovalov has left the court. Which his team are probably quite relieved about, because it means they’ll get a brief respite from him chuntering at them. Sinner holds, before Shapovalov coughs up consecutive double faults to give Sinner three break points! Sinner can’t take a single one, but then shows ridiculous powers of retrieval to stay in the point and get himself a fourth break point. Shapovalov surrenders with another double. And then screams at his coach. I think he has only himself to blame there. Sinner, from 3-0 down, leads 4-3 with the break. A word on Osaka’s landmark win. It’s been quite a journey for her to get back into the second week of a slam, you could see what it meant to her in her post-match celebrations and interview, and she’ll be so relieved to pull off a tight victory having had some gut-wrenching three-set defeats at slams. Next up is a box-office meeting with Coco Gauff, whom she says she views as a “younger sister” in her on-court interview. She’s also asked about the latest Labubu attached to her bag. After Billie Jean Bling and Arthur Flashe, this one is also a tribute to BJK and is apparently called la-billie-bu (geddit?). It’s good to see her having fun out there. Sinner, after replacing his shoe lace, gets himself a break point. He can’t take it, but soon he has another at his advantage. Shapovalov pulls off a classic one-two punch, striking deep to Sinner’s forehand, and Sinner nets. Deuce. But here’s a third break point. And this time Shapovalov misfires! Somehow Sinner has dragged himself back on to serve, despite appearing all out of sorts, and he trails 3-2. One piece of housekeeping: Kostyuk has come through against Parry after two and a half hours, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, and will play Muchova next. After breaking a string, Sinner now breaks a shoelace and has to stop mid-game. It’s all going against him. Shapovalov still leads 7-5, 4-6, 3-1. Thanks Tom. This is head-scratching from Sinner. He’s probably hit more unforced errors in this match than he has the rest of the year. Credit to Shapovalov, though, who isn’t letting up with his high-risk game. The 26-year-old hasn’t quite hit the heights in his career that were once predicted for him – injuries certainly haven’t helped – but the 2020 quarter-finalist is showing what he’s capable of here. Katy is back from her break and will see things through until the conclusion of the day seven live blog. Night all. At 0-30 down Sinner breaks a run of seven straight points won in a row by Shapovalov and manages to get it to 30-all, but then a backhand goes wide to cough up another break point. A backhand into the net offers Sinner a reprieve and a big forehand on the next point allows the number one seed to come in to seal it at the net. Sinner holds on the back of a well-placed serve. He needed that, Shapovalov leads 3-1 in the third. After taking the second, Sinner is already in a battle for the third. Shapovalov won the first two games and goes 3-0 up with an easy forehand winner into the open court. On Grandstand, Rublev has a secured a break in the second and Wong is currently serving to stay in the set, with the score at 5-3 to the Russian. Osaka is now on her deepest run at a major since winning the Australian Open in 2021. Kasatkina has to battle through her service but despite dropping two double-faults she manages to hold. Osaka is now serving for the match, with a 5-3 lead in the third. After the shock of losing the first set, Sinner has quickly got himself on terms. He sews up the second set with a rapid-fire hold to love. We’re all square after two sets, Sinner 5-7, 6-4 Shapovalov. Sinner is serving for the set against Shapovalov… Osaka looks confident as she twice works her way up the court to hit forehand winners. She earns a swift service hold when a powerful serve can only be returned high and wide. Kasatkina will now serve to stay in the match, Osaka leads 5-2. No issues for Kasatkina this time on serve. She holds to love and it’s 4-2 to Osaka. This time it’s Osaka’s turn to serve an ill-timed double-fault to cough up a break point. The error doesn’t last long in the memory and the next two points are of the highest quality as Osaka wears down Kasatkina to set up two piercing backhand winners, one cross-court, the other down the line. Osaka goes 4-1 up with another winner cross-court. Sinner was able to hold serve to go up 5-3 and Shapovalov is serving to stay in the set at 3-5 down. Kasatkina has picked the wrong time to serve a double fault and when she dumps a forehand into the net Osaka had two break points. A baseline rally ends with Kasatkina going long, it’s advantage Osaka in the third she leads 3-1. Sinner has broken Shapovalov in the second set of their match and is serving to consolidate a 4-3 advantage. Hello, first update from me: Wong has won the first set against Rublev 6-2. Osaka and Kasatkina remains on serve in the third set, the Japanese player leads 2-1. Another hold apiece and Shapovalov is 7-5, 3-2 up on serve. Sinner’s body language doesn’t look great. Tom is here to guide you through the next stages – I’ll be back in a bit … Osaka shakes off the disappointment of losing that second set as she bosses a hold to love at the start of the third. She’s often too hard on herself, which can cause her to lose clarity during points, so she needs to go easy on herself here. Elsewhere, Parry and Kostyuk are also into a decider, Munar is two sets to love up on Bergs and Coleman Wong, the 21-year-old qualifier from Hong Kong who’s making his slam debut, has a surprise 5-2 lead against Andrey Rublev. There’s no let-up from Shapovalov at the start of the second set. He’s still taking it to Sinner, who’s looking rather rattled with a couple of mis-timed shots. Sinner slumped two sets to love down against Grigor Dimitrov in the Wimbledon fourth round, before being rescued by Dimitrov’s injury retirement – could he be in danger of dropping two sets behind here too? Shapovalov leads 2-1 on serve. Kasatkina has set points at 0-6, 5-4, 40-15. A lengthy rally plays out … Osaka eventually pulls the trigger … and Kasatkina thwacks into the tramlines. And the Australian then goes long! Deuce. Which is followed by set point No 3. Kasatkina’s first serve is well wide, but she makes her second, and Osaska nets the return! After the most topsy-turvy of sets (and matches), Kasatkina has taken this third-round match to a decider. But just as Osaka has the victory line in her sights, Kasatkina breaks, and will serve for the second set at 5-4! Though the rate at which these two have been breaking each other in this set, there are no guarantees she’ll see the next game through. Osaka tosses her racket at her bench in disgust. Osaka is riding the wave now, holding and then getting to 0-30 on Kasatkina’s serve with her 20th winner of the day. And a 10th double fault from Kasatkina makes it 0-40! Osaka breaks to love and from 4-1 down she’s level at 4-4. And possibly two games away from her first last-16 slam appearance since winning the Australian Open in 2021. Sinner, once again serving to stay in the opener, starts inauspiciously with a double fault. He draws level at 30-all, but an inside-out forehand winner from Shapovalov, set up by an excellent backhand return, means the 27th seed has a set point! And 24,000 spectators gasp as the defending champion and world No 1 doubles again! Shapovalov has snatched the first set 7-5! Osaka stops the rot, breaking to 30. But, at 4-2 down, she’s still got to get another break back. Sinner, now very much in the ascendancy, gets a break point at 30-40. Shapovalov may be wondering if his chance has gone in this first set. But he gamely holds from there and seals the game with an ace. He’s got himself at least a tie-break. And there’s been a crazy turnaround on Louis Armstrong, where Osaka, having zipped through the first set 6-0, is 4-1 down to Kasatkina in the second. Shapovalov isn’t happy at the changeover, telling the umpire he’s never been called for a foot fault in his life. Sinner swiftly holds. It’s 5-5. And Shapovalov needs to quickly regroup. Shapovalov does actually have a winning head-to-head against Sinner. But his one victory came back in 2021, before Sinner turned into a cyborg, so we shouldn’t read too much into that. He gives Sinner a glimmer at 0-30, but a punchy serve down the T makes it 15-30. He’d love a few more of those. The pair go at each other cross-court in a lung-busting point, Sinner’s backhand to the lefty Shapovalov’s forehand … Sinner draws Shapovalov in with the drop shot … and then finishes his opponent off with the lob! 15-40, two break points. Shapovalov is called for a foot fault … before Sinner wins the rally from the second serve. They’re back on serve. As if it was ever going to go another way. Sinner is serving to stay in the first set. Not something I was expecting to write before this match started. He’s 5-2 down against Shapovalov, and he then gives the Canadian a head start by dropping 0-30 down. Shapovalov errs on the next two points, so it’s 30-all. Then, off-balance, Shapovalov hits his overhead well long. Sinner holds from there, after a point of real quality, but Shapovalov will now serve for the opening set. A flick of the wrist from Osaka and a perfect lob lands right on the baseline. She leads 5-0, 15-30 on Kasatkina’s serve. And that becomes 15-40, two set points. And Osaka nails a forehand return winner down the line! They do make a good bagel in New York and Osaka has just served one up to her befuddled opponent. Shapovalov backs up the break for 4-1. Sinner settles a bit for 4-2. And Karolina Muchova has finally got the better of her fellow Czech Linda Noskova, coming from a set down to prevail 6-2 in the third. The 2023 and 2024 semi-finalist will next play Parry or Kostyuk, with Parry 6-3 up in that one. Kasatkina is still flailing on serve. The double fault count is already at seven. Her problem is she likes to use a kick serve on her second serve, but that would sit up into Osaka’s strike zone, so she’s trying something different and it isn’t working. Osaka breaks again, this time from deuce, and it’s now 4-zip. And look here, a break point for Shapovalov! He leads 2-1 and 30-40 on Sinner’s serve. Shapovalov smacks a forehand down the line and Sinner surrenders his serve for the first time this tournament. Just nine minutes played and Osaka leads 3-0. It’s good to see the 2018 and 2020 champion playing with freedom again; she’s won eight of her past nine matches since linking up with Tomasz Wiktorowski, the former coach of Iga Swiatek, with the only blip being her Montreal final defeat by Victoria Mboko. Victory today would put her into the second week of a slam for the first time since the birth of her daughter in 2023. It’s a love hold apiece for Sinner and Shapovalov. And a love hold for Osaka, before she’s handed the break when Kasatkina hits b2b double faults. Osaka leads 2-0. In important news: Osaka’s purple crystal-covered day ensemble gets a second outing, after her orange night version in the first round. Kasatkina, the last remaining Australian woman in the singles after she switched allegiance from Russia this year, is also wearing purple, but she isn’t bedazzled. Sinner and Shapovalov are warming up on Arthur Ashe, as are Naomi Osaka and Daria Kasatkina on Louis Armstrong. I’m looking forward to these two matches – though Sinner’s form in New York so far suggests Shapovalov could be swiftly dispatched. At best, I’d give the Canadian 27th seed one set. He does love the big stage though and is a flashy but inconsistent player (the exact opposite of Sinner you could say). Muchova and Noskova are into a deciding set. Munar (now with the distinction of being the highest-ranked Mallorcan in men’s tennis) and Bergs (who definitely doesn’t have the distinction of being the most famous Zizou in sport) are just getting started. And France’s Diane Parry is 5-3 ahead against Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk, who blows so hot and cold but is the favourite in that match despite the scoreline. Martina Navratilova and Laura Robson are giving Gauff a B+ for today’s performance. I’d go with that. Gauff could face Osaka next. Yes please! Osaka will soon get under way against Daria Kasatkina. “I thought today I played well,” she says. “Overall I’m really happy. It’s been an emotional week but I needed those tough moments to move forward. I had fun out there. I’m so privileged to walk on to this court and have your support.” Which won’t be very long, because Gauff is ripping through the games now, leading 6-3, 5-1 and 0-30 on Frech’s serve. Make that 0-40, three match points. Gauff whacks long on the first. And Frech hits long on the second! That was a gutsy performance from Gauff after her woes the other night. She was crying in her post-match interview then; it’s good to see the smile’s now back. It’s going to be incredibly hard for her to win this tournament while remodelling that serve, but right now what matters is she’s into the last 16 for the fourth straight year. Up next for Musetti: Spain’s Jaume Munar or Belgium’s Zizou Bergs. And it could be the most famous Italian of them all in the quarter-finals. And speaking of Sinner, he’ll be on after Gauff v Frech. It’s the second time in two days a player has had to retire after diving for a shot on the hard courts, after Ben Shelton had to call it quits against Adrian Mannarino yesterday. Maybe someone should quietly remind the players this isn’t grass. Sighs on Louis Armstrong, and muted celebrations for Musetti, as Cobolli retires while trailing his great friend 6-3, 6-2, 2-0 because of that wrist injury. So Musetti is through to the fourth round for the first time – but he wouldn’t have wanted it to happen like this. “I didn’t want to finish like that, especially against Flavio. He’s my best friend on tour, we’ve known each other since we were nine years old. So a big round of applause for Flavio please. It’s a bittersweet match.” On Thursday night Gauff was shaking at the changeovers as she battled against her own serve. Now, she’s skipping back to her chair after breaking Frech for a 6-3, 2-1 lead. She then comes out on top in an attritional rally for 30-all on her serve. She then turns in Carlos Alcaraz with a showreel worthy forehand slice winner! The crowd liked that. Frech then misfires and Gauff is in command at 6-3, 3-1. Cobolli, by the way, has had the physio on three times for a wrist injury, which he suffered during the second set while diving for a volley. To make matters worse, he’s just been broken at the start of the third set too. Musetti is serving for a two sets to love lead. It’s not going as smoothly as the rest of the match for the French Open semi-finalist, as Cobolli gets two chances to break. But here’s a set point for Musetti, as he chases down the drop shot … but he knifes a backhand slice into the tramlines. A second set point comes his way … and this time Cobolli clunks at his backhand. Musetti leads 6-3, 6-2 and is a set away from breaking new ground by reaching the last 16. Gauff, her serving arm looking a little more relaxed, despite an aborted ball toss, brings up two set points at 40-15. A cross-court forehand battle ensues … and Frech finally prods long! Gauff, after surviving that mid-set wobble, secures the set 6-3. And one stat that few would have predicted before the match: she’s managed to land 79% of her first serves so far. Game eight is turning into a real tussle between Gauff and Frech, and it has the feeling of perhaps being the decisive game of this first set. From deuce, Gauff has her third break point … and she takes it! Arthur Ashe – which is as full as I’ve ever seen it at this time of day – rises. The American will serve for the opening set at 5-3 up. The tie-break sums up the first set for Muchova. Despite a commanding lead, the two-times semi-finalist just can’t shake off Noskova, who comes back from 4-2 down to snatch the breaker 7-5. … just as Gauff’s shoulders visibly drop as Noskova wins her third game on the spin for 3-3. “There are 50,000 things going on in Gauff’s head,” says the always excellent Laura Robson. “She’s thinking about all the technical aspects. Even her backhand is suspect. It seems there’s no confidence in any area of her game apart from her movement, which she can always rely on.” I agree – she’s playing in her head, not her body, which is not surprising given she’s trying to remodel her serve mid-tournament. But it’s hard to watch. But Gauff does, at least, hold for 4-3. Noskova has won four games on the spin and is serving for the first set. But the 20-year-old – nine years younger than her seasoned compatriot – blinks with three double faults. So they’re going to a tie-break. Muchova – of which there’s so much to like about her game, with her mix of spins and slice – leads 4-2 at the change of ends … Frech holds for the first time to reduce her arrears to 3-1. On the Sky commentary, Martina Navratilova is asked about Gauff looking more comfortable today, and whether she preferred playing during the day vs at night during her US Open career. She says she never liked the night matches, because the floodlights weren’t so good and it affected her volleying, as she thinks it did for Bjorn Borg. And suddenly Gauff throws in a few errors, including a first double fault, and she hands the break back to Frech. So disappointing for the American after her assured start. She leads 3-2 but they’re back on serve. Noskova has got the break back against Muchova and is serving at 5-4 down. I’m not too sure how she got there; my computer isn’t really playing ball and is only letting me watch two matches at once. So I’m dipping between that and Musetti v Cobolli. But Muchova did serve for the first set at 5-3. Gauff, looking more relaxed than she did the other night against Vekic, skips from 0-15 to 0-30 to 0-40 on Frech’s serve. Three early break points. And she then drags Frech to one corner and then the other, before dispatching the forehand winner. That’ll shake off any nerves. Gauff’s got the break and leads 2-0. Musetti has pressed the accelerator on Louis Armstrong. From 2-2, he now leads 5-2, and then flashes a forehand pass on his way to set point on Cobolli’s serve. Cobolli cooly finds a way to hold. But Musetti soon has three set points on his own serve, and he serves out the 6-3 set to love. He’s the first player with a set to his name on day seven. Gauff, the 2023 champion, could also be helped today by the fact that Frech, the Polish 28th seed, doesn’t have any stand-out weapons. Even if Gauff’s serve is still misfiring, she should be able to swing freely in her return games. That said, Frech settles the second point of the match, a 28-shot rally, with a piercing winner. Gauff is already stumbling at 0-30 on serve. But Gauff, ever the competitor, even when her game isn’t totally clicking, hauls herself up and gets to 40-30. Make that game. Gauff was in tears during and after her second-round win over Donna Vekic, such were her struggles on serve. Since winning the French Open in June she’s been plagued by serving problems and resorted to emergency action just before this tournament, splitting with her coach Matt Daly and hiring the biomechanist Gavin MacMillan, who previously helped Aryna Sabalenka overcome her service yips. But trying to remodel her serve under the public scrutiny of nearly 24,000 home fans on Arthur Ashe, has, understandably, been incredibly stressful for the 21-year-old. Perhaps playing in the day session today, rather than in the primetime night slot, will take off a little pressure. And Gauff gets a huge cheer of support as she arrives on court, even though the stands are nowhere near full. Musetti and Cobolli are still going on serve at 2-2. And despite another double fault, Noskova gets herself on the board with a hold to 30, finishing things off with a forehand winner. She trails 3-1. Coco Gauff, meanwhile, is about to step on to Arthur Ashe, so we’ll be focusing on that match once it gets going. And if you want to catch up on yesterday’s play, here are our reports: Do remember! You can get in touch with any chat. It’s always good to hear from you. Cobolli, who reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals last month at his breakthrough grand slam, withstands the pressure from his higher-ranked opponent and holds. It’s 1-1. Muchova, who’s made the last four in New York for the past two years, breaks when Noskova double faults and then makes a hash of her smash. It’s 2-0. It’s 11.21am in New York, the sun is shining and already under way are two internal conflicts, between the Italian friends Musetti and Cobolli and the Czech mates Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova. Musetti has taken the opening game on serve and is pushing for a break on Cobolli’s serve, while it’s a similar story for Muchova, who leads 1-0 and has just had a break point. Hello! And welcome to our coverage of the US Open day seven. Such has been the dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz over the past two years, it’s almost possible to have sudden amnesia for all that the Big Three managed to achieve before the Big Two came along. Having carved up the past seven grand slam titles between them, they’re now seemingly hurtling towards a third consecutive major final against each other, yet to drop a set – and after Alcaraz’s latest breeze yesterday, it’s now Sinner’s turn to remind everyone that there are two kings of New York, as the defending champion takes on Canada’s Denis Shapovalov for a place in the last 16. Sinner is second on Arthur Ashe in the day session, after Coco Gauff puts her shaky serve through another round of intense scrutiny, this time against Poland’s Magdalena Frech. On Louis Armstrong it’s an all-Italian affair between Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, before what could be another cracker, as Naomi Osaka and her countless crystals take on Daria Kasatkina. Elsewhere we’ve got Alex de Minaur, Andrey Rublev, the whitewashed Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova, plus Venus Williams, 96, in the women’s doubles. Play gets going: straight away. Don’t go anywhere!
