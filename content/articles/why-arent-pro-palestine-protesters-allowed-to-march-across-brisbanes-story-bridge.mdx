  Pro-Palestine protesters say they will challenge the Queensland police service
  in court after a planned march over Brisbane’s Story Bridge was denied
  authorisation. The two parties entered mediation on Tuesday ahead of a planned
  24 August rally at the bridge as part of nationwide protests to demand an end
  to what they, alongside UN experts and special rapporteurs, Israeli and
  international human rights groups and scholars of genocide, describe as the
  starvation and genocide of the people of Gaza. Organiser Remah Naji says she
  hopes that a third-party mediator will resolve police concerns about the Story
  Bridge march, but that protesters were “willing to go ahead with a court case”
  should talks break down. Why are protesters planning to rally for Gaza at
  Story Bridge? Justice for Palestine Magan-djin (Brisbane) has been holding
  regular protests in the city for the last 22 months since the escalation of
  the conflict in Gaza after Israel responded to Hamas’ attack on 7 October 2023
  with a full-scale invasion, bombardment and blockade of aid in the Gaza Strip.
  Police and protesters have worked together to ensure the demonstrations have
  been lawful and peaceful, with organisers promoting a family friendly
  atmosphere. Sign up: AU Breaking News email But with Israel poised to launch a
  major operation to seize Gaza City, an ever mounting death toll of Palestinian
  civilians and international aid workers and reporters – including the killing
  of prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and four of his colleagues
  on Sunday – and continued widespread malnourishment of children, Naji says it
  is time for the Justice for Palestine movement to “step up”. “It is not enough
  for us to just take our protest to the city and do a loop and come back,” Naji
  says. “No, we need to reflect the urgency of the situation. We need the whole
  city to understand that we are standing against this genocide and that we
  demand more from our government, that it uphold our obligation under
  international law as signatory to the Genocide Convention. “What we’re hoping
  to do is to make sure that this protest is visible and it is powerful and
  communicates the urgency of the situation in Gaza.” What have police said?
  Police say they would not authorise the Story Bridge march “due to public
  safety concerns and significant disruption to the rights and freedoms of other
  members of the community”. But, the QPS says it is “committed to working with
  organisers to identify an alternate route” and to “engaging with people from
  across our culturally diverse society”. “The QPS respects the right to
  peacefully assemble; however, this must be balanced with the need to ensure
  public safety and minimise disruption to the broader community,” the QPS said
  in a statement. How have police in other states responded to recent bridge
  protests? Police in New South Wales sought to deny legal protection to a
  planned protest over the Sydney Harbour Bridge earlier this month – but that
  bid was overturned by the NSW supreme court at the 11th hour. Police say
  90,000 people marched across that iconic structure, organisers put the figure
  at closer to 300,000 – regardless, the scale of the turnout ranks the protest
  as historic and the day went ahead without major incidents. In Melbourne on
  the same day, in contrast, pro-Palestine protesters were met by a wall of
  police in riot gear behind barricades and backed by a row of mounted officers
  and riot squad vans when they sought to cross the King Street Bridge. What
  happens next? Should mediation between QPS and protest organisers fail, the
  matter will be escalated to the Brisbane magistrates court.
