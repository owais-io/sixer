  We say we want men to talk about their mental health, Dan Tiernan has noticed.
  Is this what we had in mind? The joke is on the queasy atmosphere the
  Mancunian establishes at his shows, barking in the audience’s faces, behaving
  unstably and – this time around – loudly bellowing “I tried to suck off my
  dad”, over and over again. Is there a therapist in the house? Well, there
  doesn’t need to be, because Tiernan has devised “the System”, a three-point
  plan to heal himself after a drug-induced psychotic episode between
  Glastonbury 2024 and last year’s Edinburgh fringe show. We are three new shows
  into the 29-year-old’s fringe career now, and All In again finds him
  addressing his dyspraxia, his drug use and his failure to fit in. I hanker for
  the show that directs his considerable comic talents elsewhere, but in the
  meantime, this is his strongest offering so far, the self- and
  audience-abusing comedy now underpinned by structure and tending towards a big
  payoff. It begins with an inventory of the drugs Tiernan used to take, then
  splices in stories from his beloved Glastonbury festival, including a keeper
  about smuggling his gear in a jar of Nutella. The freshest material addresses
  his internalised homophobia, as we journey from his teenage years, furtively
  fantasising over Justin Bieber, to (not very) grownup life lived in fear of
  gay sex – scarier than the hetero alternative, he argues, in
  characteristically lurid terms. His problems now laid out, Tiernan moves on to
  elucidate “the System” itself, neatly flipping the script and making way for a
  rousing, Glasto-alike finale. By then, Tiernan is stripped to the waist and
  performing with even wilder commitment than across the 50 minutes prior. You
  might wince now and then at the crudeness, occasionally superfluous, of his
  material: we don’t need the act-out after the elliptical gag about his mum,
  his backside and poppers. But more often than not Tiernan nails it here, with
  a surreptitiously tender tale of a manchild adrift just about visible behind
  all the stark gags about his very dysfunctional lifestyle. • At Monkey Barrel,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
