  received care earlier in the day, we will undertake the appropriate
  investigations in line with NSW Health policy, including a joint independent
  review. “While we cannot comment on the specifics of the case during the
  review period, our thoughts are with the family, and we will continue to offer
  them our full support,” they said. Park confirmed that the matter has been
