  For attorney Kelley Henry, the visible blood was the first indication that the
  execution of her client was going wrong. At 10.15am on Tuesday inside the
  Riverbend maximum security prison in Nashville, the longtime Tennessee death
  row lawyer watched as staff attempted to place an IV into the right arm of
  Byron Black. Black was locked on to a gurney with crisscrossing black straps
  over his chest, stomach and legs, and Henry saw blood ooze from the injection
  site. The staff managed to insert the IV and cleaned the wound, but then
  struggled for roughly 10 minutes before finding a vein in Black’s second arm,
  Henry recalled. The IVs would be used to inject a lethal quantity of
  pentobarbital, a sedative, into Black, a 69-year-old wheelchair user with
  lifelong intellectual disabilities, dementia, brain damage, kidney failure,
  severe heart failure and prostate cancer. The drug was meant to render him
  unconscious as it stopped his breathing and killed him. “You’re almost home,”
  the spiritual adviser by Black’s side told him as the lethal injection began.
  While the reverend touched Black’s face to comfort him, Black started
  breathing and sighing loudly, and after several minutes groaned in agony,
  saying, “I can’t do this,” and “It hurts so bad,” according to Henry and
  several journalists who witnessed the execution. He repeatedly lifted his
  head. “I’m so sorry. Just listen to my voice,” said the reverend, who sang,
  “The Lord is my shepherd.” Black eventually became still and was pronounced
  dead at 10.43am, roughly 10 minutes after he had cried in pain. Tennessee had
  argued that Black would not consciously experience drawn-out pain. But outside
  the chamber, seven reporters shared similar accounts suggesting that was
  exactly what had occurred, the final journalist saying: “It was unanimous
  among all of us that we saw him in distress.” “Something went horribly,
  horribly wrong, and I don’t know what it is yet, and all I could do was take
  notes and watch,” Henry, who represented Black for 25 years, told the Guardian
  on Thursday. “For him to lift his head up several times and say it hurts, I
  really wasn’t prepared. I could not believe it was happening. It was
  horrific.” The execution – which Henry said she considered “100% botched” and
  amounted to “torture” – appears to be the latest in a long line of troubled
  state killings. Despite historically low public support for the death penalty,
  a handful of conservative states have continued to aggressively pursue
  executions, maintaining the US’s status as a global leader in capital
  punishment. Donald Trump, who oversaw 13 federal executions in his first term,
  has pledged to revive capital punishment, reversing Joe Biden’s moratorium on
  federal killings. Reports of botched executions include a 2024 Idaho execution
  halted after eight failed attempts to find a vein for lethal injection; an
  Alabama killing using an experimental nitrogen gas method that caused
  “violent” shaking last year; and a 2021 lethal injection in Oklahoma that
  caused vomiting and convulsing. A Guardian report in May revealed that South
  Carolina appeared to botch an execution by firing squad, a rarely used method
  now making a comeback, with autopsy records suggesting shooters missed the
  target area on the man’s heart. Tennessee’s department of correction declined
  to comment. A spokesperson for the Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, did not
  respond to an email. Lee declined to grant Black clemency. Jonathan Skrmetti,
  the state’s attorney general, defended the execution in a statement, writing:
  “Every American has the right to their own opinion about the death penalty,
  but courts rely on actual facts and actual law, not on theatrics and passion.
  Black filed a dozen separate legal challenges to avoid his sentence. Every one
  of them failed. Byron Black’s execution was entirely legal.” Black’s
  apparently excruciating death was the final chapter in a life that his lawyers
  said was marked by challenges. A fatal loophole in the law Black spent 35
  years on death row after he was convicted of the 1988 homicides of Angela
  Clay, his 29-year-old girlfriend, and her two daughters, Latoya, nine, and
  Lakeisha, six. Black has maintained his innocence, though the critical
  courtroom battles have revolved around his intellectual disability, according
  to the Nashville Banner, which reported that Black’s attorney in 1989 had
  argued he was incompetent to stand trial. During sentencing, he did not
  understand he had already been found guilty, his lawyers have said. Black
  suffered from prenatal alcohol exposure and was exposed to toxic lead as a
  toddler, contributing to lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments, his
  attorneys said. He struggled throughout school, endured traumatic brain
  injuries from playing football and was never able to live independently,
  having difficulties performing basic chores as an adult. When Henry first met
  Black in 2000, she was pregnant with her second son, and they bonded over
  conversations about family: “Getting to know Byron is getting to know his
  family. He always wanted to talk about his family’s reunions, which are just
  legendary.” She learned about how he had relatives in all 50 states, tracing
  their roots to ancestors enslaved by President James Polk. “He was always,
  always smiling. Talking to him was like sitting on the front porch having a
  glass of iced tea,” she said, recalling how he wrote down everyone’s birthday
  in a makeshift calendar and never missed them. He never complained about
  prison treatment nor asked about his case. “I would give him updates, and his
  response was always, thank you so much. I never had a visit where he didn’t
  say, ‘God bless you, I appreciate you,’ including up until the very last
  moment.” Henry, a federal public defender, watched as Black’s physical and
  mental health deteriorated over two decades on death row. For years, he
  struggled to walk, but staff at the prison would wheel him into his legal
  visits on an office chair, before eventually giving him a wheelchair, she
  said. When prostate cancer surgery went wrong, he nearly died, she said.
  “Still, he never said a negative word about the doctor.” The state conceded in
  2022 court proceedings that Black was, in fact, intellectually disabled under
  current laws. The Tennessee legislature had amended statutes in 2021 to align
  its definitions of intellectual disabilities with contemporary medical
  standards. Executing people with Black’s condition is prohibited. The courts,
  however, ruled that the new law did not apply to him, because Henry’s
  intellectual disability claim had been considered and rejected two decades
  earlier under the old standards. If he had filed the disability claim for the
  first time after the 2021 reform, his execution would have been deemed
  illegal, Henry said. It’s a procedural loophole that torments Henry, who said
  she feels responsible for what happened since it was her original claim that
  was rejected 20 years ago. “Every execution takes a piece of your heart,” said
  Henry, who has represented 13 people who were executed, three of which she
  witnessed. “But this one hurts so much … Because I raised the intellectual
  disability claim when I did, he is dead. The law was wrong, the law changed,
  and he couldn’t get due process because we’d raised it before. And I just
  cannot reconcile that.” ‘I won’t forget you’ In the weeks leading up to the
  execution, Black’s attorneys had voiced significant concerns over the
  procedure, arguing that there was a serious risk that his defibrillator,
  implanted to regulate his heart disease, would respond to the injection by
  repeatedly shocking him, causing protracted, agonizing pain. But Tennessee’s
  supreme court allowed the execution to proceed with the device activated.
  Henry said initial evaluation of the device after his death showed that it did
  not shock him. Black’s lawyers now hope that the autopsy, which will take
  weeks to complete, will help make clear what did go wrong. It’s possible the
  pentobarbital entered his muscle tissue, instead of his veins, due to the IV
  insertion problems, she said. The drug may have failed to flow properly due to
  the tight straps constraining his body, which also could have masked
  convulsions indicating pain. He may have endured pulmonary edema, a condition
  seen in others executed by injection, where the lungs fill with fluid, causing
  a sensation akin to suffocation and drowning. Henry said the lack of
  transparency around where the state obtained the drug raised fears the supply
  could be subpotent, improperly stored or have other problems. The state’s
  attorneys have argued that the pentobarbital should make people unresponsive
  and unable to perceive pain, but Black’s repeated lifting of his head while
  groaning in agony suggested otherwise, she said. Skrmetti, the attorney
  general, said in his statement that the defibrillator not shocking Black was
  “just as the state’s medical expert predicted”. He also condemned the
  criticisms of the drug, saying that in previous litigation, Black’s lawyers
  had argued that pentobarbital had lower risk of pain compared to other lethal
  injection drugs. Nine days before the execution, Henry had to explain to Black
  that she was running out of options to save him. The two wept, she recalled:
  “He grabbed me and held me really, really tight and said, ‘I want you to know
  that what you did mattered.’” Black made no final statement in the execution
  chamber. After Black was pronounced dead, Henry stood at a podium in front of
  television cameras and condemned the state for executing “a gentle, kind,
  fragile, intellectually disabled man in violation of the laws of our country
  simply because they could”. She said: “What happened here was the result of
  pure, unbridled bloodlust and cowardice. It was the brutal and unchecked abuse
  of government power. It was the result of a failed criminal legal system.” She
  told the crowd Black had said he was shy about speaking, but had asked her to
  read a message. “He wanted his friends and family to know: ‘I love you and I
  won’t never forget you. All of our relationships have been very special. It
  was my pleasure in meeting everybody and the way we connected with each
  other,” she read, through tears. “And to his legal team, who I know is
  watching this, keep doing what you’re doing. God gave you a gift. You have
  power, and I can feel it.”
