  At least five people, including a child, were killed after a tour bus carrying
  51 people crashed in upstate New York on its way back from a trip to Niagara
  Falls on Friday. The passengers were initially trapped in the wreckage,
  according to law enforcement, and then admitted to hospitals in the region
  where more than 40 of them were evaluated or treated with injuries ranging
  from head trauma to broken arms and legs. The bus, which had 52 passengers
  onboard, including the driver, was traveling eastbound when it apparently lost
  control on Interstate 90 near the Pembroke exit, roughly 25 miles (40km) east
  of Buffalo. It went into the median and then ended up in a ditch on the right
  side of the road, New York state trooper James O’Callaghan said. O’Callaghan
  told reporters at the scene that “the bus did roll” and most people had not
  been wearing seat belts. People inside were ejected as the windows shattered.
  “There were multiple ejections,” he said. “There were multiple people trapped
  and there’s multiple fatalities, and this includes children as well.” The
  driver survived. “The driver is alive and well,” O’Callaghan said. “We’re
  working with him. We believe we have a good idea of what happened, why the bus
  lost control.” He did not provide further details. Photos from witnesses
  showed the bus tipped on its side near the road, with emergency crews and
  medical helicopters rushing victims to hospitals. “There was glass all over
  the road and people’s stuff all over the road,” Powell Stephens of Medina told
  the Buffalo News after passing the scene. “Windows were all shattered.” The
  tour bus was heading back to New York City from the famous falls on the
  US-Canada border, when it crashed between Buffalo and Rochester. O’Callaghan
  said the tourists were chiefly of Indian, Chinese and Filipino origin, and
  officials were trying to get interpreters to the scene. The interstate highway
  was blocked, and O’Callaghan said there were multiple entrapments and people
  were being taken to local hospitals. The Mercy Flight medical transport
  service said its three helicopters, and three more from other services
  transported people from the crash site. At a news conference at Erie county
  medical center later in the day, Dr Samuel Cloud, the facility’s chief medical
  officer, said the crash was “probably the most trauma patients from one
  incident in my career here in Buffalo”. Two people who needed surgery at the
  center were expected to recover, said Dr Jeffrey Brewer, chief of surgery. The
  New York State Thruway Authority announced that a significant section of the
  highway was shut down in both directions. Officials urged drivers to avoid the
  area. Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, wrote on X that she had been
  updated on “the tragic tour bus accident” – and that her office was
  coordinating with law enforcement and local agencies. Letitia James, the
  attorney general, also posted on X: “This bus crash is heartbreaking, and I’m
  praying for everyone [affected]. Grateful to our first responders on the scene
  working to rescue and help people.”
