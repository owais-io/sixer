  Late last month, the FDA advisory panel – on the heels of the president’s
  “make America healthy again” executive order scrutinizing psychotropic
  medications – raised debate around the safety of selective serotonin reuptake
  inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnancy. Commonly called antidepressants, these
  medications are used to treat a range of disorders, and earlier this year a
  consortium of major mental health organizations pushed back on the
  administration’s stance. As a perinatal psychiatrist who sees pregnant and
  postpartum people struggling with conditions such as depression and anxiety
  every week, I’m deeply concerned that this public discussion – chaired by the
  controversial FDA commissioner Marty Makary – shared significant
  misinformation about mental illness and the treatment modalities (with overly
  simplified statements denouncing “chemicals” during pregnancy). Here in
  Washington DC, I recently examined a pregnant woman struggling with severe
  depression and anxiety. As she was nervously mulling treatment options we had
  discussed, she asked me questions about starting medication to treat her
  condition: will this affect my child’s development? How long will the
  medication stay in my child’s bloodstream? How much of the medication will go
  into my breast milk? Do I have to stay on it for ever? These questions are
  part of everyday practice for those who care for individuals making decisions
  about treating their mental health challenges in the course of pregnancy. And
  answering them clearly is critical for people already dealing with some of the
  most difficult and vulnerable moments of their lives. But giving established
  guidance becomes difficult at a time when the authorities themselves are
  platforming misinformation under the guise of scientific inquiry. There isn’t
  enough space here to deconstruct all of the falsehoods shared by some of the
  FDA panelists, with often meandering anecdotes that did not address the core
  issue being discussed. The panelists overstated risks, which may deter
  treatment, despite robust data supporting the safety of use of SSRIs when
  clinically indicated. As the adage attributed to W Edwards Deming goes: “In
  God we trust; all others, bring data.” Here’s the data: we know that severe
  maternal mental health challenges occur during pregnancy and the postpartum
  period. And according to a recent national study, there have been large
  declines in mental health among pregnant women – one in five pregnant women
  struggles with conditions such as anxiety and depression during their
  pregnancy. Three in four pregnant persons are untreated. That’s more than
  500,000 people every year who experience significant mental health issues
  before, during or after their pregnancies. There are also real harms of
  untreated perinatal depression and anxiety – such as preterm birth, bonding
  difficulties, and even maternal death by suicide or overdose. The low,
  manageable neonatal risks generally support initiating and continuing SSRIs
  when they’re clinically needed. These women need and deserve evidence-based
  care. And as for pregnant people who do take SSRIs, large reviews, called
  meta-analyses, find no overall rise in major birth defects from taking SSRIs
  during pregnancy, and occasional small links to heart problems with certain
  drugs disappear in larger studies. Some newborns exposed late in pregnancy may
  have an issue called neonatal adaptation syndrome – mild, brief
  withdrawal-like symptoms which include jitteriness, poor feeding and affect
  the baby’s breathing – but this almost always clears up quickly with routine
  care in the first week. There is also an inherent problem in the way the FDA
  panelists spoke about the issue: one that minimized the health of the mother
  and focused solely on the baby. I am the first person to say there is a dearth
  of science when it comes to maternal mental healthcare. We need more research,
  and it is unfair that so many are left scrambling for help outside of our
  health system. But we should be seriously weighing the risk of not treating
  these conditions because mental illness is real and has significant impacts on
  the wellbeing of the pregnant person and baby. SSRIs are not new drugs –
  they’ve been on the market for more than 30 years, and if there is a
  widespread epidemic of the harms that the FDA panel claimed, it is not
  substantiated in the data. So let’s not apply an inconsistent standard towards
  SSRIs in pregnancy. Their comments that we need more data is the last slide or
  nearly every scientific discussion – of course, we need more robust data. That
  shouldn’t seed unnecessary doubt and leave patients and their doctors in a
  limbo on how best to treat these conditions. We need the right treatment, for
  the right patient, at the right time. In this moment when trust in government
  institutions is at a low, sowing further doubt is the last thing my patients
  deserve. The American public needs to know they are getting the highest
  quality guidance; in the absence of that, lives are at risk. As we’ve seen in
  the case of vaccines, official federal guidance has been rapidly changing and
  is often out of alignment with the best science available. Professional
  medical societies are currently filling the void where government guidance
  falls short. If this panel on SSRIs is a harbinger of what’s to come, this
  might become the case for SSRIs in pregnancy. The American Psychiatric
  Association and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology have expert
  guidance on treatment, including psychotropic medications. As for my patient,
  we evaluated the data – doctor and patient – and together she made an informed
  decision weighing the risks and benefits to start an SSRI along with therapy.
  Her mood and anxiety improved, and she had a safe delivery. Both mother and
  baby are thriving. Dr Sunny Patel is a psychiatrist at Georgetown’s Thrive
  Center for Children, Families, and Communities. He recently served as senior
  adviser at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
