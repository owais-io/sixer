  Emma Raducanu said she will return to New York feeling calmer and more
  confident about herself and her prospects at the US Open than she has since
  she won the title there four years ago. She put together a brilliant
  performance against Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of the Cincinnati Open
  on Monday, narrowly losing 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (5) after three hours and nine
  minutes. Her impressive level was a reflection of the significant progress she
  has made in a positive summer on the North American hard courts. “This is my
  first year on tour playing most of the calendar,” she said. “I had a tough
  start to the year and it was very difficult to change that. But in the last
  few months I’ve been building and the level has been increasing. The players
  I’m playing and losing to, they’re all top players so that gives me
  confidence.” That confidence marks a significant contrast to Raducanu’s
  inconsistent presence on tour last year because of injuries and training
  blocks scheduled during the season. The 22-year-old did not compete for four
  weeks last year in the lead-up to the US Open, where she lost in the first
  round against Sofia Kenin. “I went home and came back and it was a really
  difficult time in New York,” she said. “Since I won the tournament, it’s not
  been easy for me there. But this year I feel different, I’m a lot calmer
  behind the court. “On the court, I take more confidence in the big moments.
  I’ve been playing those big points pretty well for the most part so I’m
  looking forward to having some time to practise, improve and then get ready to
  play there.” Since becoming the first player to win a grand slam title from
  the qualifying tournament at the US Open, Raducanu has not won a match in New
  York. Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa have withdrawn from the tournament with
  injury, meaning Raducanu’s live ranking of No 34 would be enough for a
  seeding. But numerous players could still overtake her at the Cincinnati Open.
  Either way, her positive progress and form mean that few players would be keen
  to face her early in New York. Sabalenka has stressed that she believes
  Raducanu is on the right path towards returning to the top 10: “Every
  tournament, I feel like she’s improving and getting better, and she definitely
  gonna get back into the top 10,” she said. “She’s moving well, she’s a smart
  player. She’s serving well, even though sometimes you can see where she’s
  going. But the speed, the spin is very difficult to adjust to. She’s basically
  doing everything [well].” Raducanu is next due to compete in the US Open mixed
  doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz next Tuesday and Wednesday during qualifying
  week in New York. The US Open begins a week on Sunday.
