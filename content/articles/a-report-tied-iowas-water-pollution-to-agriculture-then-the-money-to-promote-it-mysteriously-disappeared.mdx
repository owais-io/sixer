  it mysteriously disappeared

  When a team of scientists embarked two years ago on a $1m landmark study of
  Iowa’s persistent water-quality problems, they knew that the findings would be
  important to share. High cancer rates amid the state’s inability to stem the
  tide of pollutants flowing into rivers and lakes was a growing public concern.
  But now, after the completed study pointed to agricultural pollution as a
  significant source of the key US farm state’s water problems, public officials
  have quietly stripped funding from plans to promote the study findings,
  according to sources involved in the project. The report, the results of two
  years of data analysis, has been highly controversial in Iowa because of the
  large amount of evidence it cites linking water pollution – and resulting
  human and environmental health risks – to the state’s economically and
  politically powerful farm industry. Supporters of the report said the
  agricultural industry and allied public officials have tried to downplay the
  findings for months, and they fear this move is another impediment to change.
  ‘Zeroed out’ When the report was finalized earlier this year, there was a
  little more than $400,000 left in the budget, with some of that money
  earmarked for communications and “public awareness” work, travel and other
  costs associated with promoting the findings, records show. Jennifer Terry,
  the project lead on the water report, had planned in-person meetings with
  scientists and community groups to focus on recommendations made in the
  report. But those funds were recently “zeroed out” with no explanation,
  according to email communications. Funding for the water report and related
  public outreach came from Polk county, Iowa’s most populous county and home to
  the state capital city of Des Moines. County leadership has changed since the
  report was commissioned. “The intent was that at the conclusion of the report
  to make sure it was seen widely in a public education effort,” said former
  Polk county administrator John Norris, who led support for the water report in
  2023. “That was a big part of the value of it – that the public learns from
  it.” Norris, who agreed to leave office earlier this year as part of a legal
  settlement with the county, said he hoped the county would use some of the
  money in some way for water-quality work. Frank Marasco, who replaced Norris,
  did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Polk county spokesperson
  Jon Cahill. Terry also declined to comment. The water report, authored by a
  team of 16 scientists, focuses on pollution patterns in two “essential” rivers
  fed from a watershed running from southern Minnesota through the central part
  of Iowa to Des Moines. The rivers are the primary source of drinking water for
  roughly 600,000 people and considered important recreational state assets, but
  they’re commonly laden with harmful contaminants that include phosphorus and
  nitrogen, bacteria from animal and human waste, pesticides and other
  chemicals. This summer, nitrate levels in key drinking-water sources were
  measured in quantities far higher than is allowed under federal safety
  standards. Much, though not all, of the contamination is tied to agriculture,
  according to the report. Among multiple recommendations, the report calls for
  the top US corn-growing state to diversify into production of crops that
  require fewer chemical inputs, and for limits on the density of livestock. The
  water report comes alongside growing concerns about the prevalence of cancer
  across the state. For the last few years, Iowa has had the second-highest rate
  of cancer in the nation, and is one of only two US states where cancer is
  increasing. Pesticides and nitrates both are scientifically shown to cause
  cancers. Kerri Johannsen, senior director of policy and programs at the Iowa
  Environmental Council, said all allocated funds should be fully utilized to
  educate the public. “People in Polk county and across the state are facing a
  water crisis but we cannot begin to make progress until all Iowans, including
  decision-makers, understand the urgency of this moment,” she said. “The
  importance of accessible, transparent public education and awareness cannot be
  understated,” Johannsen added. “The current resources available for addressing
  our water issues are a drop in the bucket, and our elected officials have a
  responsibility to do everything they can to find a way forward for the sake of
  the health of the people of this state.” Feds add to worries The issues over
  how to address water-quality problems in Iowa, which has nearly 87,000 farms
  and ranks first in the nation for corn, pork and egg production, comes as the
  Trump administration and Republican allies in Congress are moving to dismantle
  regulations aimed at protecting water quality, including those that work to
  limit discharges of pesticides and other farm-related chemicals into
  waterways. One chief concern for environmental advocates is the Permit Act,
  which is actually a package of more than a dozen bills that would streamline
  permitting requirements. The legislation would cut protections for many
  waterways, limit requirements for updated pollution-control measures and
  exempt pesticide spraying and agricultural runoff from permitting and
  accountability, according to the advocacy group Beyond Pesticides. If the
  measures become law, it will make it that much harder for Iowans to clean up
  their waterways. In another blow to efforts to address the state’s
  water-quality problems, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently
  reversed a decision made under the Biden administration that found additional
  areas of four Iowa rivers should be designated as impaired. When waters are
  classified as impaired, it triggers stricter regulatory measures to limit
  pollutants entering the waterways and other enhanced measures aimed at
  reducing the inflow of harmful contaminants. The reversal angered
  environmental groups across the state as well as the utility providers tasked
  with cleaning up the water. But farm groups, including the Iowa Farm Bureau,
  which had opposed the impairment designations, cheered the news. News of the
  reversal broke the same week that the EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, visited
  Iowa to meet with farmers and others and attend the Iowa state fair to serve
  as a grill master at the Iowa Pork Producers Association tent. When asked what
  drove the decision to reverse the impairment decision, an EPA spokesperson
  said only that the agency had been tracking the levels of nitrates this spring
  and summer in the waterways and is “ensuring that all of the information and
  data collected by the cities, universities, and other groups is provided to
  the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for evaluation”. The agency is “not
  currently aware” of any “exceedances” of nitrates at public water systems
  “using surface waterbodies in Iowa”, the spokesperson said. The agency is
  working with state officials to “understand and resolve the issues forming the
  basis for EPA’s reconsideration of its 2024 decision”. Adam Shriver, director
  of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute at Drake University,
  said the recent events are disheartening. “I think it shows just how far we
  still have left to go,” Shriver said. “The farm bureau opposed the initial
  impairment designation and was taking a victory lap with the recent EPA
  announcement. As long as they continue to get whatever they want from every
  level of government while other stakeholders are ignored, public health is
  going to suffer.” This story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism
