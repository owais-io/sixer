  Ministers have announced a clampdown on people who continue to claim child
  benefit payments even though they have moved abroad, in measures that could
  save the taxpayer £350m over five years. The government said 2,600 people who
  had left the UK but still claimed the benefit had already been removed from
  the welfare system. Tens of thousands more people who are fraudulently or
  erroneously claiming child benefit while living outside the UK now face having
  their payments stopped as part of the government’s crackdown. The Cabinet
  Office is increasing the number of officials working on stopping child benefit
  fraud and error to 200 from next month, following a pilot programme in which
  15 investigators stopped £17m in wrongful payments in less than a year.
  Officials will use international travel data to check if claimants have moved
  overseas. Georgia Gould, a Cabinet Office minister, said: “From September,
  we’ll have 10 times as many investigators saving hundreds of millions of
  pounds of taxpayers’ money. If you’re claiming benefits you’re not entitled
  to, your time is up.” Child benefit is paid to more than 6.9 million families
  to support 11.9 million children, and is one of the most commonly accessed
  benefits in the UK. People are no longer eligible to claim the benefit if they
  are outside the UK for more than eight weeks, barring exceptional
  circumstances. Claimants must inform HMRC if they are leaving the country for
  eight weeks or more. The government wants to raise awareness of these rules,
  in recognition that some people continue to claim the benefit in error. The
  pilot was carried out jointly by the Public Sector Fraud Authority, the Home
  Office and HMRC, who compared a random sample of 200,000 claim records with
  international travel data. Where the data suggested a claimant had left the
  country, HMRC investigators performed manual checks before deciding whether
  benefits were being claimed incorrectly. HMRC contacts claimants to inform
  them that their benefits will be stopped and details their rights to appeal.
  The government has made cracking down on wrongful benefit payments a
  significant part of its efforts to cut spending. Benefit overpayments are
  estimated by the government to have cost the public purse £9.5bn in the year
  to March. The public authorities (fraud, error and recovery) bill, which is
  making its way through parliament, has been called the “biggest ever crackdown
  on fraud against the public purse”. It gives the government the power to
  recover money directly from fraudsters’ bank accounts, a move which has been
  criticised because of its potential impact on the poorest claimants. Earlier
  this year ministers attempted to reduce the government’s overall working-age
  benefit bill by £5bn a year with cuts to disability benefits, but were forced
  to backtrack in the face of a major Commons rebellion. A heavily watered-down
  version of the benefits bill, which cut the health-related element of
  universal credit for some claimants, was approved by MPs last month. Despite
  the climbdown, 47 Labour MPs still voted against the bill.
