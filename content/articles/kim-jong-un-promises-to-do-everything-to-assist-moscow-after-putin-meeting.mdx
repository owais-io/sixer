  Vladimir Putin has invited Kim Jong-un to visit Russia during a lengthy
  meeting in Beijing on the sidelines of China’s biggest military parade, as Kim
  promised to do “everything I can to assist” Moscow. North Korea has supported
  Russia in its war against Ukraine with weapons and troops, and the Russian
  president praised North Korean fighters for acting “courageously and
  heroically”. The invitation to Kim, made through interpreters and shown in a
  video published by the Kremlin, came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, accused Putin of demonstrating his “impunity” with fresh strikes on
  Ukraine overnight. Putin and Kim, the authoritarian leaders of Russia and
  North Korea, were in the Chinese capital as guests of Xi Jinping for a
  ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war,
  known in China as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. The two
  leaders appeared alongside Xi at the opening of Wednesday’s ceremony, talking
  as they walked side by side on the red carpet into Tiananmen Square. It is
  believed to be the first time the three leaders have been in the same place
  together. In a bilateral meeting of more than two hours, Kim told Putin: “If
  there’s anything I can do for you and the people of Russia, I will consider it
  as a fraternal duty, an obligation we need to bear, and will be prepared to do
  everything possible to help.” Afterwards, Kim said “see you soon” and hugged
  Putin goodbye. “We are waiting for you. Come visit us,” Putin replied. A visit
  to Russia would be just the third time Kim has travelled abroad in six years.
  The first was to the far east of Russia in 2023, and the second this week’s
  visit to Beijing, arriving on an armoured train. North Korea has become a key
  Russian ally since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Pyongyang sent weapons
  including artillery shells and missiles to Russia for the war and thousands of
  troops to fight in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces had made a
  cross-border incursion, although the deployment was initially denied. Russia
  and North Korea last year signed an agreement that mutually obliges them to
  provide “military and other assistance” in the event the other is attacked. On
  Wednesday, Putin thanked North Korea for sending troops to his aid, describing
  them as fighting “courageously” when helping Russia oust Ukrainian forces from
  the Kursk region. Putin’s visit to Beijing, which followed the Shanghai
  Cooperation Summit in Tianjin on Sunday and a bilateral meeting with Xi, came
  as Russia launched a sweeping overnight attack on Ukraine. An estimated 500
  drones and two dozen missiles were fired at western and central Ukraine,
  targeting civilian infrastructure, especially energy facilities. The attack
  also prompted Poland to scramble defence aircraft. Donald Trump met both his
  Russian and Ukrainian counterparts last month, but efforts by the US president
  to end the war have stalled. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said Putin was “showing
  his impunity”, urging tougher sanctions on Moscow. “This undoubtedly requires
  a response from the world. It is only due to the lack of sufficient pressure,
  primarily on Russia’s war economy, that this aggression continues,” Zelenskyy
  said ahead of meetings with officials from Baltic and Nordic countries in
  Denmark. In Beijing, Putin said Russian forces were advancing on “all fronts”
  but said there was a chance for peace negotiations “if common sense prevails“.
  However, he said such a meeting should be held in Moscow, a venue swiftly
  dismissed by Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha as “unacceptable”. Putin
  is wanted by the international criminal court over alleged war crimes in
  Ukraine, and there are calls by some international law experts for an arrest
  warrant to be issued against Kim for aiding Russia’s war. There has been no
  announcement of a formal trilateral meeting between Kim, Putin and Xi in
  Beijing. While Xi and Putin have declared a “limitless” partnership, analysts
  say Beijing is rankled by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and North Korea’s
  direct support of it. Xi is striving to balance his alliance with both
  nations, while at the same time avoiding further sanctions from the US and
  other allies of Ukraine.
