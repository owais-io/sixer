  Kobbie Mainoo wants to leave Manchester United after being squeezed to the
  margins by Ruben Amorim. The midfielder has not played a minute of the team’s
  two games this season and was demoted from first choice to substitute when he
  returned from injury last December. United would countenance a suitable deal,
  but there may be a lack of attractive suitors for the 20-year-old this late in
  a window that closes on Monday. Mainoo started England’s Euro 2024 final
  defeat by Spain last summer, less than two months after he scored for United
  in their FA Cup final victory against Manchester City. But his career has
  stalled under Amorim, who has said Mainoo is competing for a place with Bruno
  Fernandes, the captain. The head coach has not found a role for Mainoo in his
  3-4-3. Amorim believes the academy graduate does not have the attributes to be
  a first choice in central midfield and has not been sufficiently impressed by
  the player’s performances further forward. Mainoo is not the only United
  player with an eye on the exit. Alejandro Garnacho is among those to be told
  they should find a new club and Chelsea made further contact over the weekend
  regarding the winger but the clubs’ valuations are misaligned. United want
  £50m while the Club World Cup winners value him at £35m. A key factor in
  United’s valuation of Garnacho is that Noni Madueke moved to Arsenal from
  Chelsea for £52m and Anthony Elanga left Nottingham Forest for Newcastle in a
  £55m transfer this summer. Those players’ statistics are inferior to
  Garnacho’s, which has been pointed out to Chelsea, who have been in
  negotiations with the United executive in the past few days. Chelsea could go
  up to £40m, including add-ons, in an attempt to get a deal done. Fernandes,
  who missed a penalty in Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Fulham, could still be the
  subject of a bid from a Saudi Arabian club. In the spring Al-Hilal offered
  about £100m for the Portugal international but he decided against the
  transfer. It is understood United and the player have not had further contact
  from a Saudi club. If Fernandes is sold this may provide funds for United to
  revive their interest in Carlos Baleba. Brighton’s minimum price for the No 6
  is £100m. Chelsea want their squad to contain four wingers and see Garnacho
  competing with Jamie Gittens for a place on the left. Tyrique George, another
  left-sided option, has interest from Roma and is expected to leave. Enzo
  Maresca can choose from Estêvão Willian and Pedro Neto on the right. The
  pursuit of Garnacho continues to hinge on outgoings at Chelsea, who need to
  meet the terms of a Uefa settlement stipulating they must have a “positive
  transfer balance” to register new players for the Champions League. The desire
  to bring in another winger means Chelsea see Garnacho as a bigger priority
  than RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons, an attacking midfielder. That stance could
  change if a buyer is found for Christopher Nkunku, who continues to attract
  interest from Aston Villa, Bayern Munich and Leipzig. Nkunku will be an option
  as an attacking midfielder if he stays. Chelsea also hold an interest in
  Fermín López but it is understood Barcelona do not want to sell him. Chelsea
  are also looking to sell Nicolas Jackson, who has fallen from favour after the
  arrivals of João Pedro and Liam Delap. Their preference is for the Senegal
  striker to leave on a permanent deal but their £80m valuation has put off
  potential suitors. Bayern are interested in Jackson and have held talks over a
  loan. One compromise could be Chelsea agreeing to a loan that includes an
  obligation to buy Jackson, who has also been tracked by Villa, Napoli and
  Juventus. Other players expected to leave include Raheem Sterling, Ben
  Chilwell and Axel Disasi, who is wanted by Bournemouth on loan. Carney
  Chukwuemeka has joined Borussia Dortmund in a package worth £24m. Fulham and
  Crystal Palace are monitoring Sterling.
