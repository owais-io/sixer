  The main screening tool used to determine which domestic violence victims need
  support has “obvious problems” and should be replaced, the UK safeguarding
  minister, Jess Phillips, has said. Phillips is reviewing systems, including
  the Dash (domestic abuse, stalking, harassment and “honour-based” violence)
  questionnaire, largely relied on by police, social services and healthcare
  workers across the UK since 2009 to assess risk. Academics and others working
  in the sector have raised concerns about the 27-question tool, which assesses
  answers to decide which respondents are deemed high risk so they can be
  referred to specialist care. Phillips told the BBC’s File on 4 that she was
  reviewing the entire system supporting victims but said it would not change
  overnight. “My instinct is that the tool doesn’t work, but until I can replace
  it with something that does, we have to make the very best of the system that
  we have,” Phillips said. Any risk assessment tool was “only as good as the
  person who is using it” and people had been killed even when deemed to be at
  high risk, she said. “The grading system won’t immediately protect you. It is
  the systems that flow from those risk assessments that matter much, much, much
  more than the score.” Families of women who were murdered after not being
  graded as high risk are exploring legal action against the institutions they
  believe failed their loved ones. A number of academic studies, some dating
  back almost a decade, have looked into how Dash is performing and have found
  that it is unable to identify high-risk victims accurately. A study from the
  London School of Economics published in 2020, analysing Greater Manchester
  police data, found that in almost nine out of 10 repeat cases of violence,
  victims had previously been classed as standard or medium risk by officers
  using Dash. In 2022, academics from Manchester and Seville Universities
  analysed anonymous police force data and found 96% of victims who were judged
  retrospectively as high risk had been classed previously as “standard” or
  “medium” risk by Dash. “When it comes to the question of the reliability of
  Dash as a predictive tool, there is a growing consensus that Dash does not do
  that job at all well,” Dr Heather Strang, the director of the Jerry Lee Centre
  for Experimental Criminology at the University of Cambridge, told the BBC.
  Nour Norris, whose sister Khaola Saleem and niece Raneem Oudeh, were stabbed
  to death by her niece’s ex-partner in 2018, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme
  their risk was downgraded “to a tick-box exercise”. Phillips’ comments come
  after the government said new measures would be introduced to crack down on
  so-called “honour-based” abuse, which is motivated by the perception that a
  person has brought shame to themselves, their family or the community. Related
  crimes include female genital mutilation, forced marriage and murder. There
  were 108 domestic homicides in England and Wales in the year to March 2024,
  according to the Office for National Statistics. New statutory guidance and a
  legal definition of “honour-based” abuse will be brought in to help combat the
  crime. The Home Office will pilot a study looking at how widespread this crime
  is, a community awareness campaign will be launched and teachers, police
  officers, social workers and healthcare professionals will receive more
  training under the new policies.
