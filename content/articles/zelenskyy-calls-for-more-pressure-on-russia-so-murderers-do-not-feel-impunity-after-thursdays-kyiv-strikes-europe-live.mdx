  After the EU and the UK, Sweden has now also summoned the Russian ambassador
  to “protest against Russia’s continued attacks on Ukrainian cities and
  civilians.” Sweden wanted to “emphasise Russia’s obligation to protect
  civilians and civilian infrastructure in accordance with international
  humanitarian law,” a statement on the foreign ministry’s website said.
  Meanwhile, Russia has appeared to reject the European proposals on security
  guarantees for Ukraine, claiming they would increase the risk of a military
  conflict and turn Ukraine into a “strategic provocateur” on Russia’s border,
  Reuters reported. Chief executive of the British Council On Wednesday night,
  our office in Kyiv was damaged in a Russian missile attack. It was a stark
  reminder of the risks that an organisation such as ours faces in
  conflict-affected areas. I was relieved to hear that all colleagues were safe
  and accounted for. One colleague was injured and admitted to hospital but
  thankfully he is in a stable condition. Working under such conditions around
  the world is challenging, and yet, time and again, our colleagues and partners
  demonstrate courage and commitment in carrying on despite the dangers. Their
  resilience is extraordinary. We are working to find ways to minimise
  disruption and continuing to support our team there. … My colleagues work in
  the most complex and often dangerous places, whether in Myanmar, Iraq, the
  occupied Palestinian territories, Venezuela or Bangladesh. And they don’t give
  up when the going gets tough. If we are absolutely forced to withdraw from a
  region, we return as soon as possible. This means that our history has not
  been without tragedy. In 1971, guards were killed protecting our office in
  Dhaka during Bangladesh’s liberation war. More lives were lost during the
  Taliban attack on our office in Kabul in 2011. There have been shootings,
  arrests and detentions. We will always be grateful to the people who have
  stood with us against those who will go to the most violent ends to disrupt
  our work. Over the past 90 years there have been periods of friction, war and
  conflict and some of relative peace. I fear the years ahead hold significant
  challenge. But that is when the British Council needs to deliver more than
  ever. This war has damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure, putting the right to
  education of millions of young people at stake. The British government
  recently committed to a 100-year partnership with Ukraine, signifying the
  breadth and depth of relationships between our countries. The work of the
  British Council is more important than ever – it will continue throughout the
  war, office or no office. in Kyiv Photographs by Julia Kochetova At a
  five-storey residential apartment block in the Darnytskyi area in the east of
  the city, residents said they had heard Russian bombing in the distance. It
  was a familiar sound, and many had gathered away from the windows in central
  corridors that extended along the block, only for disaster to strike. “We
  didn’t understand what had happened,” said Oleksandr Yastremskyi, who had
  taken refuge in a corridor with his wife, Tetiana, and their son Denys. “It’s
  like something had landed into our house. And then we heard people screaming.”
  A hundred metres away, the other end of their building collapsed, sending,
  according to Tetiana, “a big wave of dust and smoke” in their direction. Ivan
  Zhelezko, a serving soldier, looked across at his bombed second-floor flat,
  its balcony hanging at an unsustainable angle. Around him in bags were a
  handful of possessions he had managed to take with him from the apartment
  where he lived with his family for 20 years. Zhelezko said he was too stunned
  to be angry, describing himself as confused. Among those who died, he said,
  were his friend’s sister and the parents of a childhood friend. The soldier
  explained that his family escaped because they left immediately after the
  first explosion, and he tried to insist the tragedy was “nothing new for me”.
  Such fatalism was hard to believe, though he added: “I’m just happy my family
  is alive.” Those who moved fast or were simply at the other end of the
  building may have been able to escape unhurt but, such was the ferocity of the
  blasts, taking down all five storeys, they could only have been caused by a
  cruise or ballistic missile attack, giving those in the path of the rockets no
  chance. Given the meeting is held in Copenhagen, as Denmark holds the rotating
  EU presidency at the moment, some ministers get asked about the recent
  allegations of US influence operations in relation to Greenland. Ireland’s
  Harris declared his full support for Denmark in response, saying: “Ireland
  fully supports and stands with the people of Denmark and the Danish government
  in relation to Greenland. I think it’s important that every country in the
  European Union stands with Denmark in relation to this matter.” We are getting
  first lines from Copenhagen, where EU defence ministers are meeting this
  morning. Ireland’s Simon Harris joined the growing chorus of those calling for
  a stronger reaction, including further sanctions. He said: “I’m absolutely
  appalled by the actions of Russia in terms of the attack on Kyiv and indeed
  the attack on the European delegation office there. This cannot be a
  consequence free zone. I think it’s very important that the entire world
  speaks with one voice in its absolute condemnation of Russia’s clear breach of
  the Vienna Convention. What’s also clear is that while the world is talking
  about peace, and how do we bring about peace and dialogue and diplomacy to end
  the war on Ukraine, it’s quite clear that Russia is continuing to engage in
  the actions of terror, attacking a civilian population, showing no willingness
  for a ceasefire, and therefore, I think it’s imperative that those of us in
  the European Union now consider further sanctions.” Earlier, Estonia’s defence
  minister Hanno Pevkur argued that the best security guarantee for Ukraine
  would be membership in Nato. Lithuanian minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, called for
  secondary sanctions on Russia and its partners, arguing it would be the most
  efficient way to stop funding the Russian war machine. Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that at least 23 people were killed in yesterday’s
  Russian attacks on Kyiv, including 22 people on a single site in the city’s
  Darnytskyi district. More than 50 people were injured, and 8 people are still
  missing. On Friday morning, Zelenskyy reiterated his call for Russia to be
  held accountable for these strikes. He said: “When instead of diplomacy Russia
  chooses ballistics, continues to modernize ‘shaheds’ for killing, and deepens
  cooperation with actors like North Korea, it means the world must respond
  accordingly. Strong sanctions, strong pressure, strong steps are needed so
  that the murderers do not feel impunity.” EU defence ministers are meeting in
  Copenhagen today to discuss what else the bloc could do when it comes to both
  pressure on Russia to bring it to the negotiating table, and support and
  security guarantees for Ukraine. Arriving for the meeting this morning, EU’s
  foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: “These attacks show that Putin is just
  mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made. So what we have to do is
  increase pressure on Russia.” Expect that to be a recurring theme in the
  ministers’ comments throughout the day. We will also hear from the European
  Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, as she is touring member states on
  the eastern flank, and from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the
  German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as they are meeting for a Franco-German
  summit in Toulon. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Friday, 29
  August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
