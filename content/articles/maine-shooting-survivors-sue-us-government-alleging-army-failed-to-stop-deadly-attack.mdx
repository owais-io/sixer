  Survivors and family members of victims of the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston,
  Maine, are suing the US government, alleging that the US army could have
  stopped the attack carried out by an army reservist but failed to intervene.
  The suit, filed on Wednesday in Maine district court, alleges that despite
  decades of knowledge about the risks posed by soldiers in crisis, the policies
  and procedures the army has developed around dealing with service members who
  are struggling with severe mental health challenges were not used to disarm
  the shooter, a sergeant with a 21-year history in the army reserve. Eighteen
  people were killed in the attack. “The army repeatedly violated its own
  policies and its own procedures,” Benjamin Gideon, one of the attorneys who
  filed the suit, said at a Wednesday press conference. “We have no choice but
  to file this lawsuit on behalf of our clients to hopefully – finally, after
  almost two years – gain some semblance of closure and justice for them and
  their family and to provide some measure of accountability,” he said. The
  shooter opened fire in Lewiston’s Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley,
  killing eight people. He then drove about four miles to Schemengees Bar and
  Grille, where he shot and killed 10 others. After a nearly two-day search, the
  suspect was found dead after shooting himself in a trailer at a recycling
  plant. The suit alleges that the US army knew that the shooter posed a
  public-safety risk several months before the October 2023 shooting, but failed
  to intervene. According to the suit, red flags included text messages and
  concerning interactions between the shooter and his peers, and targeted
  threats, which led his fellow soldiers and family to warn army reserve
  leadership and police that he was at risk of carrying out a mass shooting.
  “Despite these warnings and repeated opportunities, the army failed to act,”
  the lawsuit reads. The army did not immediately respond to a request for
  comment. Last August, an independent commission investigating the mass
  shooting concluded that the gunman’s army reserve unit missed “several
  opportunities” that “might have changed the course of events”. The suit was
  filed by more than a hundred survivors and family members of victims. Some of
  the plaintiffs lost loved ones in the shooting, others survived being shot,
  and some were bystanders or in the “zone of danger”, according to the
  complaint. The shooting devastated an entire community, said Cynthia Young,
  whose son and husband, William and Aaron Young, were shot and killed at the
  bowling alley. “On October 25 2023, we lost something precious. Some of us
  lost our loved ones, some of us have lost the ability to feel safe and
  secure,” Young said at the press conference. “Today our group takes its next
  steps toward justice for our loved ones,” she said. “We want to heal but we
  will never be whole. It’s time to hold those who are responsible accountable
  for those actions. And we all hope that these steps will help prevent
  tragedies such as this form ever happening again. This suit is one of several
  that have been filed in the last decade against entities such the government,
  gun manufacturers and tech companies by survivors and family members seeking
  recourse for their injuries and losses. In the past four years, the US
  government has settled with the families of people killed in mass shootings in
  Parkland, Florida, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Charleston, South Carolina,
  for more than $350m combined. In 2022, families of the eight people killed at
  a railyard in San Jose, California, in 2021 won a settlement with the local
  transit agency for an undisclosed amount.
