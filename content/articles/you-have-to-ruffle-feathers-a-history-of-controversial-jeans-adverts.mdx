  There aren’t many advertising campaigns that elicit responses from the US
  president and vice-president, the senator Ted Cruz and the rappers Doja Cat
  and Lizzo. But the Euphoria actor Sydney Sweeney’s recent ad for American
  Eagle denim has done just that. Critics have interpreted the campaign as
  promoting eugenics, defenders have taken the backlash as evidence of so-called
  “woke” culture in the extreme and scrutinising it has taken on the trappings
  of a cottage industry. “Clocking in for my shift at the Sydney Sweeney
  American Eagle opinion factory,” the journalist Hunter Harris wrote on her
  Substack. It comes in a long line of provocative jeans adverts, some
  objectively controversial or offensive, others more subjectively so. A 1973
  campaign from Jesus Jeans that featured the slogan “you shall have no other
  jeans before me” sparked discussion for its use of religiosity to sell
  clothes. The Italian anti-consumerist film director Pier Paolo Pasolini even
  wrote an essay on the subject in which he said the slogan “takes the form of a
  nemesis – although unintentionally – that punishes the church for its pact
  with the devil”. A series of 1980s Calvin Klein jeans adverts raised hackles
  for their use of young female models in sexually suggestive guises. “You know
  what gets between me and my Calvin’s? Nothing,” mused a 15-year-old Brooke
  Shields in 1980, in a video directed and shot by Richard Avedon. In another
  Calvin Klein campaign from 1995, which was criticised for alluding to child
  exploitation, models including Kate Moss were filmed as they undid their jeans
  and were asked: “Are you nervous?” “Calvin made millions,” said Allen Adamson,
  an author and branding expert. “He was the first one to really understand that
  buzz and controversy and being disruptive could sell denim.” The Shields
  campaign was reportedly a huge success, with many customers going into shops
  to ask for the “Brooke Shields jeans”. Levi’s also has a history of setting
  tongues wagging. The famous Nick Kamen ad from the 80s, in which he strips
  down to his underwear in a laundrette so he can wash his 501s, turned the
  straight male gaze of most mainstream ads on its head by making the object of
  desire a male model. According to the fashion historian Tony Glenville: “It
  was massive and made it even into spoofs on comedy shows. It made a huge
  impact on sales and jeans sales generally.” Levi’s made its mark again in 1995
  with a campaign in which the Filipino-American fashion designer Zaldy, sitting
  in the back of a New York taxi in drag, seems to shock the sweaty, lecherous
  driver ogling him by shaving his chin mid-drive. Landing at a time when there
  was a lack of LGBTQ+ representation in advertising, the Advertising Standards
  Authority reportedly came close to banning it. According to the retail
  marketing expert Catherine Shuttleworth, campaigns designed to turn heads
  evolve from a need to “cut through”. “Good advertising creates cut through,
  and when it comes to advertising for clothing, it’s really hard to grab
  people’s attention,” she said. Cutting through in the social media age is
  arguably much harder than before given the fragmentation of media. Adamson
  said: “It’s very expensive to reach consumers through traditional media, so
  you need social media to break through,” especially to reach younger
  consumers. But given the fact that “no one shares anything ordinary on social
  media,” it needs to be bold. “People only share something extraordinary or
  different or offensive,” he said. “To really get talked about on social media,
  you have to ruffle feathers.” For jeans this is particularly important. “The
  basic challenge is that they’ve been around forever”, said Adamson. “There is
  little to no product difference. People can talk about the fit or the
  stitching. It’s basically denim.” Glenville agreed: “Sometimes the actual
  jeans can be a bit dull. It’s packaging within the advertising, it’s styling
  and narrative that sells them.” More so than in the past, the market for denim
  is also saturated. “The denim market in America is ginormous,” said
  Shuttleworth. “You’ve got to do something that makes you stand out from the
  pack. And so I think a lot of those companies will take risks.” Even going as
  far as to get your ad banned might be a good thing, she said. “By getting it
  banned, everybody talks about it [but] if you get it wrong, suddenly you could
  have a long-term problem where people boycott your products.” For Adamson, the
  worst possible scenario for fashion advertising is that “no one notices or no
  one cares”. It’s too early to know what the Sweeney ad’s impact on direct
  sales will be, but it’s clear that people noticed and cared, andit doesn’t
  seem to have been bad for business. American Eagle shares climbed 23% in a
  week, even as commentators began to move on to the next: a Levi’s ad in which
  Beyoncé wears a blonde wig and red lipstick moved the conservative commentator
  Megyn Kelly to take umbrage and Piers Morgan to accuse the singer of
  “culturally appropriating” Marilyn Monroe.
