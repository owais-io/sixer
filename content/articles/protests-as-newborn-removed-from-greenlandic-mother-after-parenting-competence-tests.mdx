  competence’ tests

  A Greenlandic mother’s one-hour-old baby was removed from her by Danish
  authorities after she underwent “parenting competence” tests – despite a new
  law banning the use of the controversial psychometric assessments on people
  with Greenlandic backgrounds. Ivana Nikoline Brønlund, who was born in Nuuk to
  Greenlandic parents and has played for the Greenlandic handball team, gave
  birth to her daughter, Aviaja-Luuna, on 11 August in a hospital in Hvidovre,
  near Copenhagen, where she lives with her family. An hour later, the local
  municipality took the infant into foster care. Brønlund, 18, says she has
  since only seen her daughter once, for an hour, when she was not allowed to
  comfort the baby or change her nappy. The “parenting competence” tests, known
  as FKU (forældrekompetenceundersøgelse), were banned on people with
  Greenlandic backgrounds earlier this year after years of criticism by
  campaigners and human rights bodies, who argued successfully that the tests
  were racist because they were culturally unsuitable for people from Inuit
  backgrounds. As the law came into force in May, campaigners are asking why
  Brønlund was still subjected to a test. The Danish social affairs minister,
  Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, has said she was concerned by the reports and had
  requested the municipality behind the decision, Høje-Taastrup, to explain its
  handling of the case. “Standardised tests should not be used in placement
  cases involving families with a Greenlandic background. The law is clear,” she
  said. Brønlund’s case has prompted protests in Greenland, with further
  protests planned in Nuuk, Copenhagen, Reykjavík and Belfast. Brønlund was told
  that her baby was removed because of the trauma she had suffered at the hands
  of her adoptive father, who is in prison for sexually abusing her. The
  municipality told her she was “not Greenlandic enough” for the new law banning
  the tests to apply, despite her being born in Greenland of Greenlandic
  parents. Local authorities started the testing on her in April – after an
  announcement in January that the ban was coming in. They completed the tests
  in June, at which point the law was in force. Brønlund was told three weeks
  before giving birth that her child would be taken away. The municipality
  declined to comment, saying it was bound by confidentiality. But it has
  admitted to faults in its processes and said it was seeking to ensure the
  family’s legal requirements were met and “the best possible solution” for the
  family. Brønlund told the Guardian: “I didn’t want to go into labour because I
  knew what would happen afterwards. I would keep my baby nearby me when she was
  in my stomach, that was the closest I would be with her. It was a very rough
  and horrible time.” She said her first meeting with her daughter, earlier this
  week, was cut short early because the baby was believed to be overtired and
  overstimulated. “My heart broke when she [the supervisor] stopped the time. I
  was so sad, I cried out to the car and in the car. It was so fast that we had
  to leave,” she said, through tears. “My heart is so broken, I don’t know what
  to do without her.” Brønlund is allowed to see her baby, under supervision,
  only once a fortnight for two hours at a time. Her appeal will be heard on 16
  September. Brønlund’s adoptive mother, Gitte, who is half-Greenlandic and
  lived there until she was 37, said: “It feels like you are not allowed to have
  a trauma if you are going to be a mum.” Campaigners have called on the Danish
  government to take urgent action to help Brønlund. Dida Pipaluk Jensen, who is
  co-organising a demonstration in the Icelandic capital outside the Danish
  embassy on 18 September, said the way the tests were being used on Greenlandic
  people was “horrifying”. Campaigners have also held a protest in support of
  another Greenlandic mother, Keira Alexandra Kronvold, whose case prompted a
  global outcry after Danish authorities forcibly removed her daughter Zammi two
  hours after her birth. They are still separated. Of Brønlund’s case, Pipaluk
  Jensen said: “One of the reasons the municipality stated for the removal of
  her daughter was because of previous trauma in Ivana’s life. This feels so
  wrong to punish Ivana for something she is not responsible for.” Laila
  Bertelsen, the founder of Foreningen MAPI, an association that helps Inuit
  parents in Denmark, has written to the minister urging her to intervene. She
  wrote: “Here we are faced with a failure of both child and mother, which
  requires immediate political action.” Hæstorp Andersen, who is due to visit
  Greenland in September, said any municipality considering placing a child with
  a Greenlandic background in care, or considering using FKU tests on
  Greenlandic families, “must instead use a special unit known as VISO”. Anya
  Krogh Manghezi, the director of children and youth at Høje-Taastrup
  municipality, said: “Based on the case and the criticism raised, we have taken
  a closer look at our case processing. We assessed that we showed due diligence
  by contacting VISO already in January, but we must acknowledge that we should
  have repeated the contact, as the legal basis finally fell into place three
  months after April 29, 2025. “We are therefore now in close dialogue with VISO
  on how we can get advice on an updated basis as soon as possible. We are only
  interested in ensuring that the family’s legal requirements are met and that
  the best possible solution is found for the family.”
