  Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel has denied he was referring to his
  teammate Shedeur Sanders when he aimed a jab at “entertainers” in the NFL.
  “There’s entertainers and there’s competitors, and I totally understand that.
  But my job is to compete. And that’s what I’m focused on doing,” Gabriel told
  CBS from the sidelines during the Browns’ preseason victory over the
  Philadelphia Eagles on Saturday. Gabriel completed 13 of 18 passes for 143
  yards and an interception. Many on social media thought the comment was a
  reference to Sanders, the son of hall of famer Deion Sanders, who has received
  huge amounts of media attention since the Browns took him in the fifth round
  of this year’s draft. The Browns picked Gabriel in the third round of the same
  draft and the duo are in a battle with Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett to win the
  starter’s job this season. Flacco is expected to start in Cleveland’s opening
  game, but Sanders was impressive in his preseason debut last week before an
  oblique injury forced him to miss Saturday’s game. “I’m all about our team and
  each other,” Gabriel said after Saturday’s game. “I would never make that
  [comment about Sanders] and I’ve said it before that’s why it’s interesting,
  but for me I’ve explained it entertainers are you all, competitor, that’s what
  I am, and all my teammates and we both have jobs to do, so that’s it.”
