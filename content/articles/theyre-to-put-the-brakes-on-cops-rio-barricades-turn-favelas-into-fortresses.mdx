  Deep in a mosaic of redbrick favelas on the fringes of Rio, a weapons dealer,
  a drug smuggler and a crime lord held court on a corner as darkness enveloped
  the streets they rule. An unnerving arsenal of assault rifles was on show as
  the trio fielded requests from customers, locals and staff, but the mood was
  relaxed. The gunrunner sipped Coca-Cola and listened to Coldplay on one of his
  many mobile phones. A plasma television broadcast a Brazilian soap opera about
  the life of St Paul the Apostle. A gang accountant fingered wads of cash
  covering a plastic garden table below the screen, utterly unconcerned about
  being bothered by the police. The group’s laid-backness was largely the result
  of the numerous barricades designed to stop security forces from reaching
  their sanctuary in the favela: metal and concrete fortifications built by
  local crime bosses to give them time to escape police raids. “They’re there to
  put the brakes on the cops,” the gunrunner said of the obstacles, an
  increasingly familiar feature of Rio’s urban landscape as police and
  traffickers engage in a deadly arms race with no end in sight. Near where the
  gangsters sat, a 3.5-metre trench had been carved out of the road, making it
  impossible for cars to pass. Barricades first appeared on the roads leading
  into Rio’s favelas in the 1980s, as cocaine and automatic rifles began
  flooding such working-class areas and drug lords sought to obstruct police
  incursions into their turf. Back then, they were made up of supersized speed
  bumps designed to smash the suspension of any vehicle that tried to cross them
  at speed. Sometimes, traffickers placed nail-filled potatoes on the humps to
  puncture police tyres. Forty years later, the barriers have taken on a far
  more sophisticated and warlike dimension: huge, permanent roadblocks fashioned
  from steel rails, drainage pipes, boulders, tree trunks, concrete-filled
  barrels and heaps of tyres. In some places, entire walls have been built to
  stop bulletproof police vehicles advancing along strategic roads. Burning
  buses are sometimes used. “They look like medieval structures people used to
  defend their fortresses … They are works of civil engineering,” said Lt
  Claudia Moraes, a spokesperson for Rio’s military police force, whose raids
  the barricades were created to disrupt. Lt Moraes said the guerrilla tactics
  were “an affront to the state and society as a whole” and that officers
  conducted weekly operations to tear down the barricades, which made life a
  misery for favela residents. Since January, police had destroyed barricades in
  more than 2,500 different locations, removing 28,155 tonnes of rubble – the
  equivalent to the weight of 44 of Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue or 125
  Statues of Liberty. Barricades have become such a serious problem that in
  2020, Rio’s government set up an anti-blockade unit called the Special
  Operations Support Centre (NAOE). “In truth it’s a demolition squad,” Lt
  Moraes said of the group, which uses backhoes fitted with hydraulic hammers to
  smash barricades so police vehicles can access the favelas. The unit’s 41
  operatives hone their skills in a replica shantytown called “the Citadel”,
  built on a military base sandwiched between Rio’s international airport and
  one of its largest favelas. One recent morning, nine of the group’s members
  stormed the scenographic shantytown, assault rifles raised, as a black backhoe
  loader smashed a battered Fiat Palio out of its path. Twenty metres ahead,
  sparks flew as an officer used a blowtorch to cut a 5ft rail jutting out of
  the ground before a giant steel gate. The unit’s leader, police veteran Lt
  Luiz Felipe Medeiros, said real-life operations lasted up to eight hours and
  were essential to “re-establish the constitutional right to come and go” in
  gang-run favelas where ambulances, fire crews and bin collectors could not
  operate. During one mission, in a sprawl of favelas called the Complexo do
  Alemão, 20 tonnes of debris were removed after operatives destroyed barriers
  and pillboxes used to shoot at police. But Rio’s traffickers have machinery
  too, and special barricade-building teams, meaning barriers are often rebuilt
  within hours of being dismantled. Favela-born artist Tainan Cabral grew up
  watching barricades proliferate on the streets around his home. He saw the
  defensive positions as a symbol of state neglect, highlighting how successive
  governments had ceded control of chunks of the city to criminal groups. But
  Cabral also saw a creative opportunity in the illegal structures and, six
  years ago, started painting them to turn “something bellicose into something
  artistic” and bring a touch of joy to the favelas’ often violent routine.
  “Barricades transmit a climate of war … I try to turn them into sculptural
  monuments … I started to see this place as a sculpture park,” the 34-year-old
  artist said during a stroll through some of the barricaded streets he has
  beautified. Cabral uses bright, psychedelic colours he believes contrast “with
  the raw reality” of the favela. “Cheerful tones that convey peace,
  tranquillity and freshness … because the barricades are bad enough on their
  own.” Gunfights meant Cabral’s frontline artworks were frequently damaged or
  destroyed, meaning the artist constantly returned to them to make changes or
  repairs. “It’s an ephemeral open-air art gallery that dies and is reborn,” he
  said. “And I revisit the barricades because I want to keep this sculpture park
  alive.” If Rio’s conflict ever ended, the artist planned to turn the
  barricades into “postwar” memorials – but Cabral doubted that day would come.
  “It’s my dream … to see more peace. But for it to really end?” The artist
  shook his head.
