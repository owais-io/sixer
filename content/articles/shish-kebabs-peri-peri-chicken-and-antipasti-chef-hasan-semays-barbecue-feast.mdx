  I spent a lot of my childhood sitting in the passenger seat of my dad Kamil’s
  Volvo, on the barbecue run, listening to Turkish radio. We would usually get
  the same things: chicken breasts for mum, boneless thighs for the rest of us,
  and some sort of lamb on the bone for dad. He would purposely butcher it
  poorly, leaving bits of meat on the bone to grill slowly and pick at as he
  cooked for the rest – a “trick” he had learned from his dad. My love for
  barbecues, cooking over live fire, and entertaining, definitely stems from
  him. Barbecues would always start with an impromptu announcement at the table
  after Sunday morning family breakfast. Mum would begrudgingly agree, knowing
  the mess my dad can produce in about 20 minutes. It didn’t take much
  persuading in my house to get the mangal [Turkish barbecue] lit. We didn’t
  need perfect blue skies. A dry day and enough sunlight to see us through to
  the evening would be enough to seal the deal, although dad has been known to
  barbecue under a tree in a bin bag if the weather didn’t cooperate. One of us
  kids would get dragged to the Yasar Halim mediterranean market in Haringey,
  north London. Excuses of “but I’ve got homework!” and “football’s on!” would
  be thrown around the table, leaving me, the youngest, in the firing line.
  Dad’s finger would point straight down the table to me. “Put on your shoes,
  boy.” We had a routine: we would split up to shop. I would grab the herbs,
  vegetables and rice or bulgur. Dad would be talking to the butcher, eating the
  unwashed grapes in his basket, and pulling off bits of bread. As Turks,
  hospitality was always a big thing in our household. It’s a value I’ve
  inherited, and live by as an adult. Guests are a blessing, and watching my
  friends and family stuffing their faces while I sit in front of a mangal in a
  vest, socks and sandals, with a semi-dirty tea towel over my left shoulder, is
  my happy place. These days, I don’t always have the time to be running around
  supermarkets for a last-minute barbecue, so I plan ahead just a little bit
  more. Ordering from Ocado means I can get the essentials sorted quickly, while
  knowing everything I’m serving is good quality. If there’s one thing I’ve
  learned in my many years at the grill, it’s to strategise. I like to take my
  time with barbecues, but I don’t want people starving while they wait so I
  fill a table with picky, dippy and pully bits. Guests arrive, you say hello,
  hand them a drink, usher them over to the grazing table and leave them there.
  Antipasti, cured meats, dips to dunk breadsticks in – Ocado Moroccan inspired
  houmous is a go-to – and something pickled to keep the palate entertained
  before the show starts. For the starters table M&amp;S Collection red pepper
  &amp; walnut dip M&amp;S grilled Turkish olives M&amp;S sundried tomatoes
  Ocado Moroccan inspired houmous M&amp;S sunburst peppers Ocado Spanish mild
  chorizo ring Unearthed Spanish style pickles Ramona’s original houmous Ocado
  pitted green olives M&amp;S balsamic marinated onions The secret to barbecuing
  meat is choosing cuts with a high fat content. Fat + charcoal = smoke which
  leads to flavour. Crispy bits of dancing fat and acidic garnishes for me are
  the memories of my childhood, think chimichurri (this one from Ocado hits the
  spot), salsa verde, or just a squeeze of lime to give meat vibrancy. Something
  to eat alongside a nicely dressed salad or way too much potato salad … For the
  mains M&amp;S lamb merguez sausages M&amp;S grill new yorker chicken flatties
  M&amp;S 4 lamb shish kebabs Chimilove medium chimichurri M&amp;S spicy pickle
  pot Ocado peri peri chicken grills M&amp;S Grill 4 king prawn skewers with
  nduja marinade We often finish barbecues at mine with fresh fruit. Growing up,
  the fruit of choice was always watermelon. There’s nothing like biting into a
  slice and letting the juice cleanse your palate – plus, it helps keep everyone
  hydrated. Watermelon can be hit or miss in the UK, but Ocado fruit is fresh
  and tasty. That being said, with the sun shining bright and a stomach full of
  delicious things, who can actually say no to ice-cream … And for afters Ocado
  watermelon Häagen-Dazs crunchy cookies &amp; cream stick bar Twister pineapple
  lemon-lime and strawberry mini ice-cream lollies Choosing the right charcoal
  is just as important as selecting the right food – and being able to order it
  from Ocado alongside everything else keeps things fabulously simple. Make sure
  your charcoal is running white hot and spread it evenly in your barbecue to
  avoid flare ups and inconsistent cooking. Eating barbecue is almost as messy
  as cooking it, and nobody likes to be patronised by a grownup drink in a
  child’s cup, so make sure you’ve got the essentials in order, too … Equipment
