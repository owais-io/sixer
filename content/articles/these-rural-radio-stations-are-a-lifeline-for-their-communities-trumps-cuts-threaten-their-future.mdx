  Since Republicans last month slashed over $1bn in funds designated for public
  broadcasting, non-commercial TV and radio stations around the country have
  been reeling. The cuts led the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the
  nearly 60-year-old organization that has long supported local TV and radio
  stations across the US, to shut down operations entirely, leaving more than
  1,500 local stations nationwide without a critical source of income. For rural
  radio stations that rely heavily on federal grant and matching funds – and
  that are often the only sources of free and reliable programming in their
  regions – the consequences are especially dire. Often, these stations are
  residents’ only reliable avenue for not only news and cultural programming,
  but also local health and public safety information, including emergency
  alerts. To understand what this programming means to rural Americans and the
  hardships communities could face if broadcasts went quiet, the Guardian spoke
  to two radio stations that serve distinct populations. Here is what they
  shared. Reaching Spanish-speaking farm workers in rural Washington Wildfires
  are a frequent threat in Yakima county, Washington. Rural, hot and dry, the
  agricultural region can face days on end of poor air quality – an occupational
  hazard to the thousands of farm workers who work outside, many of whom
  exclusively speak Spanish. National broadcasters like NPR put out emergency
  announcements in English, but their information, about an evacuation or unsafe
  breathing conditions, may go unheard by a Spanish speaker. The local public
  radio station Radio KDNA has found a way to combat that gap. Built
  specifically for the region’s Spanish-speaking farm workers in this county
  where more than half of the population identifies as Latino, the station has
  developed a system in which DJs translate the English emergency notices into
  Spanish – live on the air. It’s one of many ways the station, which its
  director of operations, Elizabeth Torres, says is the only 24-hour
  Spanish-language public broadcaster in the region, meets the needs of its
  unique listener base. “Over the years, it has developed a sense of trust with
  the community,” Torres said. It’s not the only public service Radio KDNA
  provides. In operation since 1979, the station runs programs focused on public
  health, highlighting Spanish-language clinics and vaccine drives; occupational
  health, with guests speaking to the specific concerns of people who work
  outside and on farms; education, featuring presenters from the local community
  college; and children’s entertainment, designed explicitly for the many
  parents in the community juggling work and childrearing. Every week, the
  Yakima Valley Farmworkers’ Clinic goes on the air for an hour to discuss the
  services they provide, Torres said. Community health workers will share
  diabetes prevention information. Sometimes, doctors come on as guests to
  discuss heart disease, or the importance of maintaining regular flu and Covid
  vaccinations. They even ran a Spanish-language special on long Covid. “We’re
  focused on information that will help our community make better decisions,”
  Torres said. The station produces its own news segments three times a day –
  two of which are entirely live. In today’s dynamic political environment,
  these broadcasts are especially valuable for immigrants, who face a daily
  barrage of information and misinformation about raids and deportations and
  need help deciphering fact from rumor. KDNA has also partnered with an
  immigrant services organization that provides legal advice and detention
  tracking services. “We don’t put out any information on Ice until it’s
  verified,” Torres said. “We’re trying to minimize misinformation.” Considering
  the lifestyle and literacy rates of its listener base, KDNA’s broadcasts – and
  audio as a medium – are designed to be accessible. “You can tune in and out as
  you’re working or as you’re driving,” she said. “All of our programming is
  developed in a way that people will understand.” Running such an operation is
  not cheap, and Torres says that federal funding has played a huge part in the
  station’s ability to do this work, with 40% of KDNA’s revenue coming from the
  CPB on average every year. The station already operates on a tight budget,
  Torres said, with staff members wearing multiple hats. The news director
  moonlights as the audio tech if the regular engineer is unavailable; the
  underwriter (who coordinates paid sponsorships) is also the building manager.
  She fears that the funding cuts could dramatically restrict what is feasible
  in terms of output. KDNA will probably need to reduce staffing, cut back on
  community events, and limit the external broadcasts they pay to air, like
  NPR’s Spanish-language shows, she said. Her biggest concern is if live
  programming is limited, there may not be an on-air DJ to translate critical
  alerts. “Families that need to evacuate, they might not get the message,” she
  said. “That is going to have a real impact.” ‘The only voice available’ in
  Navajo territory Listening to the radio was a big part of Richard Grey’s 1960s
  childhood. He remembers the voices of AM DJs traveling through his house as he
  got ready for school in the mornings and listening to the BBC when it came on
  the air every evening. Not many people who lived on Arizona’s rural Navajo
  nation had television. Radio was how they got information about their
  community – and beyond. “It brought the world to us,” Grey said. Today,
  between limited broadband access and the vast distances residents drive to
  reach brick-and-mortar resources like libraries or post offices, public radio
  remains a vital resource for the Navajo nation, which, at over 27,000 square
  miles spread across three states, is the country’s largest Indian reservation.
  Since 1989, residents have tuned into KGHR Navajo Public Radio to access
  everything from Indigenous cultural programming to political commentary to
  world news. Broadcasting with more than 100,000 watts of power, the station is
  able to reach almost all residents on the western side of the reservation,
  which is no small feat in a region defined by challenging geography. Grey, who
  has worked with the station since 2011, says that makes it an invaluable
  service: “Phones can’t go down into a canyon or around a mesa, but radio
  does.” In terms of infrastructure, KGHR is bare bones. It shares its
  facilities with Greyhills Academy, a high school in Tuba City, and is
  primarily run by part-time contractors. Its only full-time staff member,
  announcer Keri Blackrock, came onboard a little over one year ago. But the
  station’s output is robust. KGHR offers Indigenous cultural programming,
  including music curated by audio engineer Michael Begay and a Navajo Word of
  the Day show coordinated by students at the school. It syndicates a wide range
  of national and international news programs, like Native Voice 1, NPR and the
  BBC World Service. And it produces its own coverage of local sports games,
  parades and community events. “Hearing a community member – and a tribal
  member – go live on the air is very meaningful,” said Begay, noting that
  announcer Blackrock is herself Navajo. “The audience can go, ‘It’s one of us,
  a familiar face, a familiar voice.’” By his own account, Begay was a
  floundering high schooler at Greyhills Academy in the mid-1990s when he
  wandered into the station. Working as a student DJ gave him a sense of
  purpose, and when he realized that he couldn’t go on the air if he wasn’t at
  school, his grades started to improve. He suggests that without KGHR, his life
  would have taken a very different path – and perhaps even been cut short. “I
  would be a statistic,” he said. The station also protects public safety. As
  part of the country’s emergency alert system, it broadcasts vital information
  about heatwaves, wildfires and floods. For many people on the reservation,
  KGHR is their only avenue to learn about an evacuation order – like last
  month, when a wildfire swept across 100,000 acres near the New Mexico border.
  Knowing rural residents may not have reliable internet or cell service,
  Blackrock broadcast updates from local tribal police and shared information
  residents were posting on Facebook on the air. “It’s our job to broadcast
  incidents so that the community is kept informed and safe,” said Begay. Now,
  this crucial service is under threat. Almost all of the station’s funding
  comes from federal sources, said Grey, and CPB is KGHR’s main source of
  revenue. Going forward, they might need to venture into new territory
  entirely, like hosting live events, airing paid advertisements for sponsors,
  or creating digital content for paid subscribers. “I don’t believe we’ve ever
  really asked for donations,” said Blackrock. Without KGHR, the airwaves will
  lack Native perspectives on politics and culture, and issues that are
  underrepresented in the mainstream media, like missing and murdered Indigenous
  people, will get even less attention. For those reasons, they don’t plan to go
  off the air – at least, not without a fight. “Tribal radio stations will
  continue to serve as vital platforms for preserving Indigenous language and
  cultural traditions,” said Begay. “Our job is ensuring these aspects remain
  vital and present for future generations.”
