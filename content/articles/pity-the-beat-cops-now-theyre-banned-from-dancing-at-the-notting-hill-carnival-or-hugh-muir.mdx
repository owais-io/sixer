  It’s a world in flames. Too much antisocial behaviour, too many street gangs,
  too few crimes being solved – but fear not, the Metropolitan police
  commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has a plan to fight back. Go to the Notting
  Hill carnival this weekend, he’s told his officers. Keep the peace, lay down
  the law – and I’d better not catch you dancing. He’s right to be concerned.
  Dancing policemen are a menace. They undermine tradition and the public’s
  trust. The Laughing Policeman was bad enough, but dancing ones? You wonder how
  they ever got through the vetting and the training. From now on, perhaps it
  will be a specific part of the vetting and the training. “Regan, you almost
  made it through, but when we played that bit of Rihanna in the final module,
  you shimmied a bit and there was a definite head bob. I’m sorry, this job
  isn’t for you.” There are many problems in the running of and the policing of
  the Notting Hill carnival. The numbers are too big, the west London space too
  small. We know there’s crime: two murders last year and melees in which more
  than 60 officers were injured. No one underestimates the challenge. Last week,
  Tory members of the London assembly called for city hall to take over the
  running of the event, and mooted once again the idea that it could move to a
  park, Hyde Park perhaps, and become ticketed. No one close to the event and
  its tradition wants that. But everyone knows that, security-wise, things have
  to change. Will motionless, ear-plugged officers do that? I’m not sure that’s
  the eureka moment. I can’t quite equate the difficulty of keeping roads
  unblocked and hyped-up young men from maiming themselves and others with the
  dereliction of rogue officers momentarily shaking a leg to Mighty Sparrow,
  Sean Paul or Shaggy. How does that work in fact? Is that the officer who says:
  “There is a punch up over there and I know I should intervene, but I do like
  this banging tune, and I’m having a nice dance, so I’ll wait until it’s
  finished?” I don’t think any officer would do that, and I doubt the
  commissioner really thinks so either. The statement from Scotland Yard says:
  “Almost 7,000 officers will be deployed to this year’s event. They are there
  to keep revellers safe, not to join in the revelling. We want officers to
  positively engage with the carnivalgoers while staying vigilant at all times
  and remaining able to respond and intervene swiftly as necessary. They can’t
  do this if they are dancing. The standards of behaviour expected as part of
  the policing operation will be communicated clearly before the event, just as
  they have been in recent years.” On its face, this last bit appears to reveal
  that those who have got jiggy wit it at carnival in recent years have been
  dancing disobediently, perhaps with intent, perhaps with malice aforethought.
  As for those who have actually danced in actual contact with the revellers,
  well, bring back Keir Starmer’s all-night courts. There is, of course, a
  simpler explanation for this new diktat, rather than any genuine nexus between
  carnival crime and the beat officer who likes the beats. It’s not really that
  too many officers over-engage: it’s that occasionally one makes a human
  connection, and someone takes a photo of that, and it ends up on the TV and in
  the papers – because little else happens on a bank holiday – and the rightwing
  press goes full tonto about woke coppers who talk to folk they should be
  tasering. Before you know it, someone is saying that the commissioner himself
  is a woke disciple who secretly loves Afrobeats and privately takes the knee
  on Congolese religious holidays, and that we really need new leadership, of
  the kind that Nigel Farage would seek out were he to reach No 10. And all of
  that grouching is bad for the top team at Scotland Yard, who’ll be forgiven by
  the right if they never catch another criminal, so long as they don’t go woke.
  So the best thing for them, short of stopping the music itself, is to stop the
  thin blue line dancing, even for a smiley snapshot. And so they have. It’s all
  quite funny, and it’s all quite sad. Because those pictures of communal
  revelry between the public and law enforcement were sometimes a bit cringe and
  often a bit stagey, but they spoke to a desire of some officers to present as
  a police service rather than a police force – and showed an enthusiasm from
  carnivalgoers to embrace that. And for those who weren’t there, those moments
  – like the time in 2017 when a PC Daniel Graham threw his shapes and went
  viral – conveyed a world that doesn’t always exist, but one that most of us
  would like to see. We’ll have the old pictures as an archive, but pity the
  officers deployed to carnival this year: concerned about the crush, concerned
  about the crime (with optimists at the Mail already predicting “three days of
  carnage”) and now concerned that a surveillance camera might catch them
  twerking in the line of duty. Jeez, isn’t policing dangerous enough as it is?
