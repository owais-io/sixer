  Publications aimed at LGBTQ+ and other diverse audiences are facing “good
  old-fashioned discrimination” as advertisers avoid them after political
  attacks on diversity and inclusion campaigns, editors have said. Senior
  figures at publications aimed at the gay community and other minority groups
  said a previous “gold rush” to work with such titles was over. There has been
  a backlash in the US over corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
  efforts in the past 18 months, which has led to some big names rolling back
  their plans. Tag Warner, the chief executive of Gay Times, said his
  publication, which had been growing digitally in the US, had lost 80% of its
  advertisers in the past year. It has also lost in excess of £5m in expected
  advertiser revenue. Warner, who has led the outlet since 2019, said his
  title’s growth had been accompanied by an enthusiasm from brands to embrace
  LGBTQ+ audiences. He blames an anti-DEI drive in the US for the dramatic
  shift. “I know that media and marketing is also going through a challenging
  year anyway, but when we’re thinking about other organisations that don’t talk
  to diverse themes, they’re not nearly as impacted as we are,” he said. “This
  is just good old-fashioned discrimination. Because discrimination doesn’t have
  to make business sense. Discrimination doesn’t have to be logical.
  Discrimination is discrimination. “We’re really experiencing the impact of
  what happens when voices that are pressuring organisations to give in to less
  inclusive perspectives start winning. Then it creates this massive behavioural
  shift in brands and organisations.” Nafisa Bakkar, the co-founder of Amaliah,
  a publication aimed at “amplifying the voices of Muslim women”, said there had
  been a “change in mood” among brands and advertisers. “There was this DNI
  [diversity and inclusion] gold rush,” she said. “It is, I would say, well and
  truly over. “We work with a lot of UK advertisers, but I would say that the US
  has a lot more emphasis on what they would call ‘brand safety’, which I think
  is a code word for ‘we don’t want to rock the boat’. I would say there is a
  lot more focus on this element.” Ibrahim Kamara, the founder of the youth
  platform GUAP, which has a large black and ethnically diverse audience, said
  he had detected a “relative difference” from 2020 in approaches from brands.
  He and others cited the economic pressures on advertisers generally in recent
  years. However, he said the “hype and the PR around wanting to support and
  connect with diverse audiences” had also subsided. “The thing that most people
  within these kind of spaces can probably agree on is that the energy and the
  PR is very different now,” he said. “It was almost a badge of honour to be
  able to say that you’re supporting certain communities. Now, I’ve seen that
  lots of the diversity and inclusion people that were hired around that period
  have probably lost their jobs. It doesn’t have the same PR effect any more.”
  Warner said the anti-DEI impact pre-dated the return of Donald Trump to the
  White House. Figures such as the conservative pundit Robby Starbuck have been
  engaged in a long-running anti-DEI campaign, pressuring firms to drop their
  diversity efforts. However, Warner said Trump’s arrival “gave everyone, I
  think, permission to be honest about it”. Not all publications in the sector
  have been hit in the same way as Gay Times. Companies with business models
  less reliant on US advertising, as well as some big players with
  long-established relationships, said they had managed to negotiate the
  changing political environment. “Brands are nervous, that’s for sure, or
  careful – or a combination of both,” said Darren Styles, the managing director
  of Stream Publishing, which publishes Attitude magazine. “They’re aware it can
  be a lightning rod for a vocal minority. But our experience is that most
  people are holding their ground, if not doubling down.” Styles also said he
  was not complacent, however, given the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform party in
  the UK and its lack of historical support for the LGBTQ+ community. “I’m not
  incautious about the future,” he said. “Who knows what next year will bring,
  because that narrative is not going away. Obviously, there’s the rise of
  Reform in the polls. “[Farage] is quite clearly not an ally to our community
  and he’s expressed disdain in the past at the awards we’ve given out to people
  in the trans community. So it is a worry as political momentum gains around
  there. But I think broadly, consumers in the UK are a bit more capable of
  thinking for themselves.” Mark Berryhill, the chief executive of equalpride,
  which publishes prominent US titles like Out and The Advocate, said some
  brands and agencies “may have been a little bit more cautious than they have
  been in the past”. However, he said it had so far meant deals had taken longer
  to be completed, in a tough economic climate. He said the political headwinds
  made it more important to highlight that working with such titles was simply a
  sound business decision. “We’ve tried to do a better job in this political
  climate of just selling the importance of our buying power,” he said.
  “Everybody’s cautious and I don’t think it’s just LGBTQ. I think they’re
  cautious in general right now with their work with minority owned companies.
  “The one thing that maybe this whole controversy has helped us with a little
  bit is to really make brands realise it’s a business decision. It’s not just a
  charity or something you should do because you feel guilty. “You should do it
  because it’s the right thing to support LGBTQ journalism. We’re small. We need
  to get the word out. We have important stories to tell. But it’s also a good
  business decision. The more we show that side, certain brands will come
  along.”
