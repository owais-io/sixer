  SpaceX was forced to scrap the launch of its giant Starship rocket from Texas
  again on Monday, this time due to weather, marking the latest in a streak of
  setbacks for the Elon Musk-run company. The 232ft (71-metre) tall Super Heavy
  booster and its 171ft tall Starship upper half – together taller than New
  York’s Statue of Liberty – was due to take off from SpaceX’s Starbase rocket
  facilities at 7.30pm local time. But the launch was called off at the last
  minute. “Standing down from today’s flight test attempt due to weather,” the
  company said on X, the social network also owned by Musk. SpaceX has seen a
  series of delays as it seeks to achieve several long-sought milestones
  essential to the rocket system’s reusable design. A liquid oxygen leak at the
  Starship launchpad nixed a Sunday launch attempt, billionaire Musk wrote on X
  overnight. Development of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, key to the
  company’s powerful launch business and Musk’s goal to send humans to Mars, has
  faced repeated hiccups this year. Nasa hopes to use the rocket as soon as 2027
  for its first crewed moon landing since the Apollo program. SpaceX’s Starlink
  satellite internet business, a major source of company revenue, is also tied
  to Starship’s success. Musk aims to use Starship to launch larger batches of
  Starlink satellites, which have so far been deployed by SpaceX’s workhorse
  Falcon 9 rocket, into space. Musk, for his part, remained bullish. “In about 6
  or 7 years, there will be days where Starship launches more than 24 times in
  24 hours,” the entrepreneur said on Sunday, replying to a user on X. This
  year, two Starship testing failures early in flight, another failure in space
  on its ninth flight, and a huge test stand explosion in June that sent debris
  flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s capital-intensive
  test-to-failure development approach, in which new iterations of rocket
  prototypes are flown to their technical limits. That ethos is markedly
  different from SpaceX’s rivals such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, whose New
  Glenn rocket made an operational debut in January following years of
  on-the-ground development and testing. The new Vulcan rocket from United
  Launch Alliance, co-owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, had a similar
  upbringing before its 2024 debut. With SpaceX’s approach, testing failures
  early in Starship’s flight prevent the company from gathering vital technical
  data needed to advance the rocket’s design. Still, SpaceX, which Musk expects
  to record about $15.5bn in revenue this year, has continued to swiftly produce
  new Starships for test flights at Starbase, a sprawling and rapidly growing
  rocket industrial complex. The area was made a municipality in May by local
  voters, many of them SpaceX workers. Starship’s setbacks underscore the
  technical complexities of the latest iteration. The ship is packed with far
  more capabilities than predecessor models such as increased thrust, a
  potentially more resilient heat shield and stronger steering flaps crucial to
  nailing its atmospheric re-entry – key traits of its rapidly reusable design
  that Musk has long pushed for. SpaceX has a lengthy to-do list for Starship’s
  development before the rocket begins routine missions envisioned by Musk. That
  includes demonstrating safe returns from space, payload deployments in orbit
  and complex in-space propellant refuellings crucial to its moon mission
  assignments from Nasa. Once in space, Starship will attempt to deploy mock
  Starlink satellites and reignite an engine along its suborbital path around
  the globe. Atmospheric re-entry over the Indian Ocean will test its exterior
  steering flaps and an array of experimental heat shield tiles as the ship
  blazes through intense friction and heat. Reuters contributed reporting
