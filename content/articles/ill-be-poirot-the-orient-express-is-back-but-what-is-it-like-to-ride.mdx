  ‘If anyone mysteriously vanishes, I can be Poirot,” said the passenger from
  India, twirling his moustache. It felt as though the spirit of Agatha
  Christie’s most famous character – best known for solving the Murder on the
  Orient Express – was lingering in the breeze at Palermo’s sublime botanical
  garden, which had been transformed into a makeshift waiting room for the 40 or
  so travellers about to board an Italian replica of the fabled train. Sipping
  espresso and sampling cannoli, the classic Sicilian pastry, the curiosity and
  suspicion for which Poirot is famous was palpable as the passengers subtly
  sized each other up. But the only mystery waiting to be unravelled over the
  next couple of days was whether their Rome-bound journey on La Dolce Vita
  Orient Express would live up to their dreamy expectations. The sleeper rolled
  into service in April with the aim of reviving the glamour of the original
  train, as well as the romanticised notion of Italy’s dolce vita, or “sweet
  life”, not to mention tapping into the resurgence in demand for slow luxury
  travel. Comprising refurbished carriages formerly in service on Italy’s
  railway in the 1960s, the train has spent the last few months taking
  passengers on various journeys: through Tuscany’s wine region, to Venice and
  along the Ligurian coast – all of them sold out. Now the Dolce Vita has
  ventured south, and the Guardian was invited to experience its debut voyage
  from Palermo, Sicily, to the Italian capital. The original Orient Express made
  its initial journey in 1883, and crossed much of Europe on long-distance
  itineraries stretching from Paris to Istanbul, before reaching the end of the
  line in 2009, the victim of both high-speed rail and low-cost flights. But
  various offspring kept its legacy alive, with passengers still hungry for
  high-end nostalgic escapades far from the chaos of airports and overcrowded
  tourist hotspots. “The ultra-high-end market is constantly growing and demand
  for rail experiences is developing in a significant way,” said Dario
  Minutella, a luxury and fashion sector analyst at the management consultancy
  firm Kearney. “But it’s not just the preserve of millionaires or billionaires.
  There are many people with the time and resources seeking an experience, and
  Italy, with its long coastline and beautiful landscapes beyond the big cities,
  provides the perfect package.” At Palermo station, we were greeted by Stefano
  Sgambellone, the Dolce Vita’s train manager, and his team of impeccably
  dressed staff. “In 1883, the Orient Express became the first way to travel
  slowly, in luxury,” said Sgambellone, who for years worked for Venice
  Simplon-Orient-Express (VSOE), a luxury rail service with a range of European
  routes. “Today, slow travel is even more popular than it was then.” While the
  focus of VSOE is primarily the onboard experience, the Dolce Vita itinerary
  also includes off-board jaunts and experiences across its 10 Italy-only
  itineraries, such as learning to cook a local dish, exploring
  off-the-beaten-track medieval towns and dining in a private Venetian home.
  “People are choosing the Dolce Vita not only for the train itself, which is
  beautiful, but because it’s the best way to discover Italy,” said Sgambellone.
  The train’s whistle blew at 10.30am, and we departed Palermo. It then glided
  along Sicily’s sparkling northern coastline, passing the town of Cefalù and
  the city of Messina, offering distant views of Salina, one of the Aeolian
  islands, along the way. Lunch has been curated by Heinz Beck, owner of the
  three-Michelin-starred La Pergola restaurant in Rome. In the afternoon, the
  train stopped in the Sicilian hilltop town of Taormina, where passengers had
  the opportunity to explore its ancient Greek theatre. The Dolce Vita
  initiative, with plans for a fleet of six trains, is a collaboration between
  Orient Express, the brand part-owned by the French hospitality group Accor;
  Arsenale, an Italian luxury hospitality company; and the heritage arm of
  Italy’s state railway, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane. Itineraries are between
  one and three nights onboard, and needless to say, they do not come
  cheap,starting at €3,060 per person for a two-day/one-night trip into the
  heart of Tuscany’s wine region, to more than double that for the
  three-day/two-night trips. The luxury train is not the only service that has
  benefited from FS Italiane’s project to revive abandoned rail tracks. A
  network of historic routes has opened up under its Timeless Tracks initiative,
  offering a cheap way to explore Italy’s less visited areas, such as the
  highlands and hidden hamlets of Abruzzo or the mountains of Friuli-Venezia
  Giulia, while promoting sustainable tourism. Tickets for these shorter trips
  start at just €5. There has also been a renewed focus on sleeper train
  services. The passengers on this trip had come from all over the world. There
  was the family from India seeking a once-in-a-lifetime experience; another,
  from Scotland, celebrating a milestone birthday. There was the US author, the
  Italian ambassador and the Parisian couple who are seasoned long-distance
  train travellers. It was also the first time that Britt Moran and Emiliano
  Salci, the architects from the Milan-based Dimorestudio who designed Dolce’s
  1960s-inspired cabins, restaurant and bar, had travelled on the train.
  “Obviously we had seen it before,” said Moran, “but in terms of the whole
  experience: wow, this is so nice!” After a night onboard in Sicily, the
  carriages were loaded on to a privately chartered ferry for the 30-minute
  crossing to the mainland. From there, the train headed up the coast of
  Calabria and towards Maratea, where it made another afternoon stop, before
  departing for Rome in the evening. When the Dolce Vita arrived at Ostiense
  station the next morning, all the passengers appeared to be satisfied. While
  they boarded the train as strangers, running the risk of animosity in such a
  confined space for two days, they disembarked as friends. The trip was
  provided by La Dolce Vita Orient Express; the three-day/two-night From Sicily
  to Rome trip starts at €11,280 per person (From Rome to Sicily starts at
  €9,440)
