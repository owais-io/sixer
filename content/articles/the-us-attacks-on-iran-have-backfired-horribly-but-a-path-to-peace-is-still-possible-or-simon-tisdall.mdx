  Hanging is the preferred method of execution in Iran, although stoning and
  crucifixion offer alternative options for an ever-vengeful theocracy. Death by
  hanging is not necessarily quick. Strangulation and suffocation can take
  several minutes. The UN says more than 600 people have been judicially
  murdered so far this year. Iran has more executions per capita than any
  country in the world. Since June’s US and Israeli attacks, growing numbers of
  victims are political dissidents. Fifty days on, nothing remotely positive has
  resulted from the illegal bombing raids and missile strikes mounted by the US
  president, Donald Trump, and Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, despite
  their boasts of world-changing success. Iran’s nuclear facilities were not
  obliterated, as Trump claimed. Tehran has not abandoned uranium enrichment.
  The regime did not fall, despite Netanyahu’s call for an uprising. If
  anything, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is more defiant. He has
  since launched a new crackdown on opponents, hence the executions. Deploring
  last weekend’s hanging of political prisoners Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi
  Hassani, Amnesty International linked their fate to the US-Israeli attacks.
  Arrested in 2022, the two men were charged with rebellion and “enmity against
  God”. They were tortured, forced to sign confessions and sentenced last year
  after a five-minute trial. The decision to execute them now “highlights the
  authorities’ ruthless use of the death penalty as a tool of political
  repression in times of national crisis to crush dissent and spread fear”,
  Amnesty said. Hundreds have been arrested since June in a regime drive to
  unmask spies and collaborators, real or imagined. Glaring intelligence
  failures that, for example, allowed Israel to locate and bomb a national
  security council meeting, injuring Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, are
  officially blamed not on gross incompetence but supposed fifth columnists.
  Iran’s parliament wants to expand use of capital punishment. Up to 60
  political prisoners face execution. This typically harsh reaction by clerical
  hardliners around Khamenei, and within the judiciary and Revolutionary Guards,
  comes despite a surge in patriotic sentiment after the attacks, which
  reportedly killed at least 935 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than
  5,000. By intensifying repression, the regime squandered a chance to harness
  public anger, not least against Britain and European governments that turned a
  blind eye. US-Israeli actions have had other far-reaching, negative
  consequences. The attacks breached the UN charter and international law, as
  the Brics group of “global south” countries noted. They led Tehran to suspend
  UN nuclear inspections. They exacerbated US-Europe divisions. And, ironically,
  they increased the likelihood of Iran building a bomb for self-defence. Iran
  insists it does not possess and does not want nuclear weapons. For all
  Israel’s vaunted intelligence capabilities, neither Netanyahu nor anyone else
  has definitively proved otherwise. The decision to attack was based on a
  guess, driven by fear and hatred. It caused serious physical damage, but did
  not change mindsets. Iran is adamant it will continue to enrich uranium for
  civilian purposes. The bombing was a bust. Trump’s angry threat to strike
  again is confirmation of failure. What this reckless act of aggression did do
  is encourage rogue states such as Russia to believe they, too, may attack
  other countries with impunity. It reinforces the belief in Iranian ruling
  circles, and not only among rejectionist factions, that the west cannot be
  trusted and a closer alliance with China is necessary. It strengthens the hand
  of hardliners whose fondness for regional proxy warfare, and recently
  documented covert operations against Britain, has entrenched Iran’s pariah
  status. Historically speaking, Iran was and is an avoidable tragedy – one of
  the west’s worst-ever geostrategic own goals. Unthinking support for the shah
  helped spur the 1979 revolution. The subsequent, far from inevitable
  ascendancy of conservative clerics plus abiding, irrational US animosity,
  feeding off memories of the humiliating Tehran embassy siege, rendered the
  rift permanent. Europe tried and failed to chart a middle path. In 2018, Trump
  reneged on the US-, UN- and EU-ratified nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed
  sanctions. This last of many disastrous policy mistakes led directly to
  today’s impasse. With wiser heads, it could have been very different. All
  parties to this conflict should study the French Enlightenment philosopher
  Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu, a foe to tyranny in all its forms.
  Writing in his 1721 bestseller Persian Letters more than 300 years ago, he
  issues an impressively prescient warning about what were then imaginary
  weapons of mass destruction. “You say that you are afraid of the discovery of
  some method of destruction that is crueller than those which are used now,”
  his fictitious Persian traveller Usbek writes to a friend. “If such a fateful
  invention came to be discovered, it would soon be banned by international law.
  By the unanimous consent of every country the discovery would be buried.” In
  the sense that nuclear weapons are outlawed, Usbek’s optimistic prediction was
  correct. But not “every country” complies. If the US and Israel are sincere
  about preventing Iran acquiring the bomb, they should set an example and
  reduce, and ultimately eliminate, their nuclear arsenals. They should stop
  threatening renewed attacks. And they should back talks on a regional nuclear
  pact, as proposed by Iran’s former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Only
  then, perhaps, will Tehran come in from the cold. Only then, perhaps, will its
  paranoid leaders stop hanging innocent people. Simon Tisdall is a Guardian
