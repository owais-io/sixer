  Volunteer beach cleaners are finding more vapes than ever before as plastic
  pollution chokes Britain’s coastline. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) on
  Wednesday launches its annual beach clean, which last year involved more than
  15,000 volunteers who completed more than 1,200 litter surveys. The charity is
  calling for swift and strong action at the UN’s global plastics conference in
  Geneva this week, where countries are deciding on their pollution policies.
  Some forms of plastic are on the rise, according to MCS litter volunteers. Of
  those surveyed, 41% mentioned finding more plastic items (including plastic
  cups, bottle caps/lids, microplastics), including 19% more vapes, 26% more
  fishing litter (including lines/nets), 11% more dog poo bags and 11% more wet
  wipes. But there were some positive findings that demonstrated how good policy
  can make a difference. Volunteers on the beach cleans log every piece of
  litter they find so that a comprehensive dataset of rubbish on beaches can be
  built up and trends observed. Their research found that the number plastic
  bags littered on beaches reduced by 80% between 2015 and 2024, after a charge
  on carrier bags was introduced. The MCS says this shows that policy changes
  can quickly make a positive difference to the amount of pollution in the
  environment. Summer is a bad time for litter on UK beaches. Seventy-four per
  cent of MCS volunteers said they found an increase in beach litter during the
  summer, compared with winter months, due to increased visitor numbers plus a
  gap in public awareness around environmental impacts. Volunteers who take part
  in the litter pick have asked local authorities and governments in the UK to
  build better infrastructure including more accessible bins on beaches. Litter
  pickers said the problem was widespread and harming wildlife. Violet Fraser,
  who has been cleaning beaches on the Western Isles in Scotland, said she had
  found birds’ nests with plastic in, while Colette Edwards in Norfolk reported
  regularly finding seals caught in discarded nets on her local beach. Plastic
  is a particular scourge on beaches as it does not biodegrade, instead breaking
  down into microplastics that stay in the environment indefinitely, and these
  are easily ingested by marine animals and can cause illness and even death. A
  spokesperson for the MCS said: “The amount of plastic found on beaches
  increased by 9.5% between 2023 and 2024. The continued presence of plastics on
  our coastline highlights the need for a circular economy in which consumers
  have more options and access to use refillable and reusable products.
  “Beachwatch data has already been used by governments across the UK as
  evidence to introduce litter reducing policy – such as the carrier bag charges
  and bans on certain single-use plastics, such as straws, cutlery, plates and
  bowls, and the recent UK-wide commitment to ban plastic wet wipes.” Isaac
  Kenyon, a volunteer, said: “There’s something deeply grounding about standing
  on a shoreline and knowing that your small actions are part of something much
  bigger. Every piece of litter picked up is one less hazard for wildlife, one
  less piece of plastic in the ocean, and one small step toward a healthier
  planet.” The Great British Beach Clean runs from 19-28 September.
