  A pair of Montagu’s harriers have raised four chicks in an English wheat
  field, the first success for Britain’s rarest breeding bird since 2019. The
  fledglings took their maiden flights this week after being closely monitored
  by the RSPB and the local farmer, with a protective wire-mesh fence installed
  around the nest to repel predators such as foxes. The location is being kept
  secret because it is private farmland, but also to enable the young birds to
  feed up and grow in strength without disturbance from over-enthusiastic
  birders. The Montagu’s harrier has long been a rare species in Britain but
  after a recent high of nine successful nests in 2011 its population has
  dwindled, with no fledging successes for six summers. The migratory raptor
  overwinters in sub-Saharan Africa before heading north to nest in Europe,
  often in arable fields. In recent decades its nests have been accidentally
  destroyed by agricultural intensification, such as mechanised harvesting and
  crop-spraying, as well as breeding birds struggling in wetter summers. In its
  remaining strongholds, such as France and Spain, many nests in cereal fields
  are protected from ground-nesting predators by installing temporary small
  metal fences around them. The pair were first spotted in May and closely
  monitored by a local volunteer and the RSPB, with a drone being used under
  licence to locate the nest. Once the youngsters hatched, the nest was
  protected with fencing earlier this month. Mark Thomas, the species lead for
  Montagu’s harriers at the RSPB and an expert in protecting vulnerable birds of
  prey, said: “We are overjoyed that a pair have returned, they managed to find
  each other and through the close protection of a dedicated farmer and the RSPB
  have managed to raise four youngsters.” The farmer, who is not named to
  protect the location, said: “It’s fantastic to have these amazing birds on the
  farm and a just reward for the extensive conservation work we have been
  undertaking for decades.” Adult harriers are often site-faithful, raising
  hopes they may return to the same spot next summer. Rings on the parent birds
  have revealed that the male is a long-lived bird from a British nest in 2015,
  while the female fledged from a French nest in 2023. Thomas added: “This
  Anglo-French alliance could just be the springboard needed to save this
  species in Britain.”
