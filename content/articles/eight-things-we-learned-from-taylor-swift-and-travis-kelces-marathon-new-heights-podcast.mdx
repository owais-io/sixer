  Heights podcast

  How Travis and Taylor got together Two years ago, American footballer Travis
  Kelce famously used the New Heights podcast – which he hosts with his brother
  Jason – to announce that he wanted to date Taylor Swift. This was after he
  failed to get her attention at her Eras tour show at Arrowhead Stadium, home
  to his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. Somehow, it worked: he managed to get the
  girl. Swift has now shed some light on how she felt about this approach. “It
  was such a wild, romantic gesture to just be like, ‘I want to date you’,” she
  said, looking at Kelce. But he “never did any proper logistical planning” to
  meet her at Arrowhead, she joked. He didn’t even contact her management. “[He
  thought] because he knows the elevator lady, that he could talk to her about
  just getting down to my dressing room. That’s how it works in 1973!” As
  someone who is “genuinely terrified to open my DMs”, she said Kelce’s blunt
  announcement intrigued her. “This felt more like I was in an 80s John Hughes
  movie and he was just standing outside of my window with a boombox being like,
  ‘I want to date you! Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a
  friendship bracelet’ … I was like, if this guy isn’t crazy – which is a big if
  – this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me
  since I was a teenager.” She described Travis as “a vibe booster in everyone’s
  life that he’s in. He’s like a human exclamation point.” How they handle
  attention about their relationship Jason Kelce asked how his brother and Swift
  deal with the intense public speculation about their relationship, including
  the numerous theories going around online. (“I’m way too invested,” Jason
  said.) “I don’t see a lot of things,” Swift said. “I’ve been in the music
  industry for 20 years. It’s pretty hard to hurt my feelings at this point.”
  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips
  for the weekend, every Saturday morning Travis Kelce said he’d learned from
  his girlfriend “how to be a pro about it”. “There’s still some wacko theories
  from the beginning that I was like, ‘Oh no, how is she handling this,’” he
  said. “The last thing I wanted to do was screw this up.” Finding humour in it
  helped, Swift added: “It’s at a point where … my name can be in the actual
  headline and it can still be none of my business.” The similarities between
  being a pro footballer and a pop star Part of Swift’s preparation for her
  three-hour shows on the Eras tour was repeatedly running full speed on a
  treadmill while singing the entire show. She said Eras required “a lot of
  physical therapy” and “a lot of being in a state of perpetual discomfort”,
  including aching feet and plenty of blisters. She saw similarities in Travis’
  career: “I’m not getting hit by huge 300-pounders, but the heels …” “When I
  saw the recovery station in the hotel room after [the Eras show], with the
  toe-spacers … I’m telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy,” Kelce said.
  “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. She does more than I do.’ … We related on how much
  torture we put our bodies through.” Taylor sent her mother to buy back her
  master recordings Swift signed with her first label, Big Machine, at 15,
  giving them the rights to her master recordings. In 2019, label head Scott
  Borchetta sold her first six albums to music executive and Swift foe Scooter
  Braun, who then sold them to the private equity firm Shamrock Capital for a
  reported $300m. To regain control over her catalogue after the sale to Braun –
  and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a project to rerecord the
  albums, rebranding each one as “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding new tracks. And
  in May, the singer bought back the master recordings to all six albums, giving
  her control over her entire catalogue for the first time. On the podcast,
  Swift revealed she had been saving to buy back her catalogue since she was a
  teenager – and “it really ripped my heart out of my chest” each time it was
  sold. When the Eras tour ended, she sent her mother and brother to negotiate
  on her behalf with Shamrock Capital, not lawyers, because she wanted to convey
  the emotion involved. “‘[These are] my handwritten diary entries from my whole
  life; these are the songs I wrote about every phase of my life’ … Rather than
  send lawyers or management in a big crew, I sent my mom and my brother,” Swift
  said, crying. “They told them what this meant for me, they told them the whole
  story of all the times we’ve tried to buy it, all the times it’s fallen
  through.” She cried again as she recalled her mother telling her Shamrock had
  agreed to sell: “I just, like, very dramatically hit the floor … I started
  bawling my eyes out.” She ran to Travis crying to tell him the news, while he
  was playing video games. “He thought something was wrong; I started absolutely
  heaving. I had no power in my legs to support myself.” She said an unexpected
  bonus of the “Taylor’s Version” rerecords was raising awareness among
  musicians about what they might be signing away. “I have so many new artists
  come up to me now and say, ‘Hey, I didn’t even know this was a thing.’” Taylor
  Swift really loves coming up with the Easter eggs Perhaps the biggest thing
  that separates Swifties from the rest of the population is their appetite for
  Swift’s Easter eggs – hints she drops about her future music or deep-cut
  callbacks to past songs. (Sorry, Swifties, everyone else is either bewildered
  or mildly exasperated by this.) For The Life of a Showgirl, for example, she
  left the stage at her final performance on the Eras tour by walking down an
  orange tunnel – the colour theme for her 12th album – and has peppered in
  references to both orange and the number 12 on her social media. “People are
  like, ‘The Easter eggs thing is getting a little Zodiac killer at this point.’
  I’m like, as long as they like it, ya know?” Swift said. But: “I’m never gonna
  plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life. It’s always gonna be
  towards music.” She said her favourite was the 2022 commencement speech she
  gave at NYU, while receiving an honorary doctorate. Swift says she planted “so
  many lyrical Easter eggs in that speech” that hinted to Midnights, released
  later that year. “I love numerology, I love math stuff, I love dates, that
  stuff I just find really fun,” she said. She might be on your baking blog
  Swift revealed that “my hobbies could be categorised as hobbies you could have
  had in the 1700s.” She likes sewing, painting, cooking and has “a different
  baking obsession every six months”. “I’m the luckiest man in the world,”
  Travis said. The couple are currently both “very deep in a sourdough obsession
  that has taken over my life,” Swift said, adding: “I’m really talking about
  bread 60% of the time. It’s become a huge, huge factor … I’m on sourdough
  blogs! There’s a whole community of us!” “There are a lot of people hoping
  that you’re on their blog,” Travis joked, to which Swift replied, “Oh, I’m on
  your blog. Girl, I’m on your blog.” Travis Kelce really likes otters The
  internet agreed Kelce was officially a good guy when a dig through his old
  tweets turned up this charming nugget from 2011: “I just gave a squirle [sic]
  a peice [sic] of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea
  they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.” In between sourdough blogs, Travis
  shows her videos of wild otters, Swift said. “I want a wild otter so bad,”
  Travis said. “I just want to find these little creatures and be their friend.”
  Swift said: “He wants one specifically whose life he saved and who knows he
  saved its life … He doesn’t want to go up to an otter and take it from its
  mother. He wants to see an otter who is like, ‘My paw’s caught in a shell. And
  he’s like, ‘I got you.’ And then the otter’s like, ‘Thank you forever’, with
  its little paws.” “And then I bring him anchovies every couple months,” Travis
  said. Oh, and Swift has a new album coming The Life of a Showgirl is out 3
  October, with Swift revealing it is inspired by everything that happened
  behind the scenes while she was on the Eras tour. Travis shared his review:
  “It’s so much fun … I know there are only 12 bangers. It is a lot more upbeat
  and a lot more fun pop excitement. I think it’s a complete 180 from a lot of
  the songs on Tortured Poets, for sure.” “Life is more upbeat,” Swift said,
  laughing.
