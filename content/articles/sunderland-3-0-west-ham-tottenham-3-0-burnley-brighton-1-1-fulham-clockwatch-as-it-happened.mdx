  Time to wrap things up. Thanks for your company and emails, and don’t forget
  to join Scott Murray for the remainder of Wolves v Manchester City. Goodnight.
  West Ham manager Graham Potter reacts to their 3-0 defeat at Sunderland Very
  disappointing. The second half performance wasn’t good at all in terms of the
  basics. I thought the first half was good – we controlled the game for large
  periods in a hostile environment. The first goal isn’t good enough from our
  perspective, and then the game becomes difficult for us. We’ve got a big game
  on Friday in front of our own supporters – we have to react and do a lot
  better. Wolves v Man City is under way. You can follow that game with Scott
  Murray. Thomas Frank’s reaction I’m extremely happy with the three goals and
  the clean sheet. If I’m brutally honest, I felt we were a little bit out of
  sync at times but the overall performance was good. I like the mentality and
  the hard work. We worked a lot on crosses, which is big for me, and we scored
  from two of them. That’s an element I was very happy with. What a performance
  from Richarlison. His work rate, his intensity and on top of that two goals –
  especially the last one – is exceptional. I’ve just been told there were 17
  passes [before one of the goals] and that all the players touched the ball.
  That’s nice. Mohammed Kudus I’m very happy with the performance and the
  result. [On Richarlison’s second] As a winger part of my responsibility is to
  serve the strikers. I don’t think it was a perfect cross but he made it look
  so good! It’s good to set up the strikers; I’m here to serve them. Part of the
  reason I came here is to play in the position I want to be in – and where I
  can entertain the fans, because I think that’s what the game is about. But the
  most important thing is doing it at the right time. Richarlison Thank you for
  the assists [pats Kudus on the shoulder]. I’m so happy with this guy – next
  week he deserves to score because he works so hard for the team. I think this
  guy’s Brazilian! I’m so happy with the game. Sunderland goalscorer Dan Ballard
  reacts It’s amazing to be back in the Premier League – and what a performance
  to start us off. [On the three goals being scored by players who were at the
  club last season] We’ve had a lot of new signings but there was a lot of
  quality here, that’s the reason we got promoted. I was delighted for the two
  boys to get their goal as they were so influential last season. I felt really
  confident today, I thought I would get a goal. It was a fantastic ball. The
  place was rocking. This was very, very close to [the atmosphere at] the
  Coventry game. Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle Brighton 1-1 Fulham Sunderland 3-0
  West Ham Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Blackburn 1-2 Birmingham Bristol City 0-0
  Charlton Millwall 0-2 Middlesbrough Preston 2-1 Leicester Sheff Wed 0-3 Stoke
  Swansea 1-0 Sheff Utd Watford 2-1 QPR Those are the 3pm games, and here’s what
  happened in the early kick-offs. “About that Manics album,” says Peter Oh.
  “One of the tracks has a title that fits modern football in many ways: All Is
  Vanity. “PS I saw the Manics play a gig in San Francisco on their Journal for
  Plague Lovers tour, at the legendary Fillmore. I remember having the feeling
  that the power of their sound would blow the doors off the hinges.” That’s all
  she wrote at the Amex Stadium. Rodrigo Muniz’s last-gasp equaliser, a clinical
  snapshot after a corner flashed across goal, has given Fulham an unlikely
  point. Sunderland are top of the Premier League! But not any more. Rodrigo
  Muniz has equalised for Fulham! 90+5 min: Brighton 1-0 Fulham Kenny Tete has
  missed a sitter for Fulham in the fifth of six added minutes. Just before
  that, Paul Merson announced on Sky Sports that you could put up six hours of
  added time, never mind six minutes, and Fulham still wouldn’t score. And so
  far he’s right. A comfortable start for Thomas Frank including two goals for
  Richarlison, the second a marvellous flying volley. A perfect end to a perfect
  second half for Sunderland! Wilson Isidor has put them 3-0 up with the help of
  a mistake from West Ham’s new goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Preston 2-1 Leicester
  “Jeremy Monga is the same age as Journal for Plague Lovers by the Manics,”
  writes Matt Dony. “I’m going to bed.” If it cheers you up any, old man, it
  looks like Monga’s historic goal will be in vain as Preston have gone back in
  front. 88 min: Brighton 1-0 Fulham James Milner, 39, has just come off the
  bench to begin his – yikesorama – 24th Premier League season. It sounds like
  Brighton have the game under control; well, as much as you can at 1-0.
  Nottingham Forest have announced the signing of Omari Hutchinson, one of the
  stars of the England Under-21 side that won the European Championship in the
  summer, from Ipswich. We’ll have more on that deal later I’m sure. Premier
  League latest Brighton 1-0 Fulham Sunderland 2-0 West Ham Tottenham 3-0
  Burnley Championship Ruben Selles’ miserable start to life at Sheffield United
  is in danger of continuing. They trail 1-0 at Swansea, whose goal was scored
  in the 66th minute by Ronald. One O. Preston 1-1 Leicester City Jeremy Monga’s
  goal makes him the youngest ever goalscorer in the English second tier. He’s
  16 years 37 days old and has beaten a record set by Jude Bellingham for
  Birmingham in 2019. Who else? What a return for Sunderland. Dan Ballard, whose
  goal against Coventry is one of the main reasons Sunderland are in the Premier
  League, has planted a brilliant header past Mads Hermansen to double the home
  side’s lead. Ederson isn’t in the Manchester City squad, so another giant of
  the 2017-24 could be on his way. James Trafford is in goal for City. Scott
  Murray has the full team news. Championship Jeremy Monga has scored a fine
  individual equaliser for Leicester at Preston. If you don’t want to feel
  really, really old, look away now. Monga was born in July 2009. Premier League
  latest Brighton 1-0 Fulham Sunderland 1-0 West Ham Tottenham 3-0 Burnley
  “Richarlison has been by a very long distance the best player on the field
  today,” says Kári Tulinius. “While I realise he’s the epitome of a footballer
  that flatters to deceive, he could blossom in a striker-centric Thomas Frank
  system. He’s already scored half the number of league goals he scored last
  year, and twice the number of league goals during his first season.” All done
  at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Brennan Johnson has put Spurs 3-0 up
  against Burnley. He ran onto Pape Sarr’s through ball and finished with a
  gentle stab past Martin Dubravka. When I say ‘all done’… 64 min: Sunderland
  1-0 West Ham Mayenda’s goal was also a fine finish. He got in front of Nayef
  Aguerd to meet the substitute Omar Alderete’s cross from the left and force a
  precise header back across Mads Hermansen. 63 min: Tottenham 2-0 Burnley
  Richarlison’s second goal was so good, an elegant scissor kick into the bottom
  corner from 12 yards. He was running away from goal as he met the ball, which
  made the grace and precision of the volley even better. Like his first goal,
  it came from a right-wing cross by the debutant Mohammed Kudus. Sunderland are
  back, baby! Eliezer Mayenda is the Michael Chopra des nos jours; he’s scored
  Sunderland’s first goal on their return to the top flight. Richarlison had
  doubled Spurs’ lead with a belter! 56 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley “Richarlison
  is one of my favourite players because of his off-field stances: specifically,
  for opening up about his struggles with depression and urging others who are
  struggling to seek treatment, and for his critique of Jair Bolsonaro’s fascist
  regime (in stark contrast to his countryman Neymar on the latter),” writes
  Michael Weller. “At the same time, his goal for Spurs today highlights one of
  the eternal verities of being an Evertonian: that wherever football is played,
  you’re never far from seeing a former Everton player score for another team.”
  It’s interesting – euphemism alert – that despite his off-field decency
  Richarlison would probably walk into a Premier League’s Most Hated XI. The
  sale of Joao Pedro to Chelsea means Brighton need a new penalty taker. When
  Georginio Rutter is fouled by Sander Berge, Matt O’Riley obliges with an
  emphatic spotkick. Wolves v Man City (5.30pm) The late Premier League game is
  at Molineux, where Manchester City’s revamped team face Wolves. We’ll have
  team news for that game soon enough. Championship roundup Here’s our write-up
  of the early Championship games, including a ding-dong gave at Pride Park.
  Peep peep! The players are back for more and so, dear reader, are we.
  Blackburn 0-0 Birmingham Bristol City 0-0 Charlton Millwall 0-0 Middlesbrough
  Preston 1-0 Leicester Sheff Wed 0-1 Stoke Swansea 0-0 Sheff Utd Watford 2-1
  QPR A reminder that you can follow all the EFL games on our live scores page.
  Half time: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley Thomas Frank’s new team lead Burnley thanks
  to a smart early finish from Richarlison. Half time: Brighton 0-0 Fulham
  Nothing to see here. Half time: Sunderland 0-0 West Ham A tight first half at
  the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland have seven new signings in their
  starting XI. 42 min: Brighton 0-0 Fulham “It’s all Brighton” is the verdict of
  Paul Merson on Sky Sports. Sounds like Carlos Baleba is dominating midfield as
  usual. Premier League latest Brighton 0-0 Fulham Sunderland 0-0 West Ham
  Tottenham 1-0 Burnley League One Quite the first half at Bloomfield Road,
  where Blackpool lead Huddersfield 3-2 but have just been reduced to 10 men.
  Niall Ennis, who scored two of Blackpool’s goals, has now been sent off for a
  dangerous high challenge. 34 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley It sounds like Burnley
  are coming into the game, albeit without really testing Guglielmo Vicario. 30
  min: Brighton 0-0 Fulham Kaoru Mitoma misses the clearest chance to date,
  heading off target from Matt O’Riley’s cross. 27 min: Sunderland 0-0 West Ham
  A neat move from West Ham ends with El-Hadji Malick Diouf’s shot being cleared
  off the line by Dan Ballard. It sounds like that game has been pretty even so
  far. Championship Luca Kjerrumgaard, a giant Danish forward on loan from
  Udinese, has scored two goals in five minutes at Vicarage Road. Watford lead
  QPR 2-0. 23 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley The possession stats – Tottenham have
  had 81 per cent – are grim reading for Burnley, and lovers of promoted teams
  more generally. Slightly weird phrase to write, but this is a big season for
  the promoted teams. Premier League latest Brighton 0-0 Fulham Sunderland 0-0
  West Ham Tottenham 1-0 Burnley 17 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley A bit of
  Spurs-adjacent news: Eberechi Eze, a target for Daniel Levy and friends, may
  miss Crystal Palace’s match at Chelsea tomorrow. You didn’t pick Richarlison,
  did you? The first Premier League goal of the Thomas Frank era has been scored
  by Richarlison. Burnley tried to play out from the back, lost the ball and
  were punished. Mohammed Kudus’s cross bounced up awkwardly towards
  Richarlison, who adjusted his body to drag an accomplished excellent finish
  past Martin Dubravka. 6 min: Spurs 0-0 Burnley We’ve had the first
  eight-second corner of the Premier League season, awarded by Michael Oliver
  against the Burnley keeper Martin Dubravka. Nothing came of it but you’d
  imagine those timewasting punishments will become a background feature of the
  season. Championship match report: Wrexham 2-3 West Brom With the spotlight
  fixed on their Hollywood infused opposition, it is easily forgettable that
  West Brom’s Ryan Mason is just lighting the touchpaper on a hopefully lengthy
  and fruitful managerial career. Mason will know already that he will thrive or
  fail on his substitutions, and a lunchtime double switch that instantly earned
  three precious Championship points should boost his confidence. Championship
  Stoke’s Million Manhoef has put them ahead inside the first minute at
  Hillsborough. You can follow all the EFL goals as they go in via our live
  scores page. The three Premier League games are under way. They were all
  preceded by a minute’s silence in memory of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre
  Silva. Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, who was racially abused at Anfield last
  night, has thanked his teammates, the Liverpool players and the match
  officials for their support last night. Match report: Aston Villa 0-0
  Newcastle Newcastle demonstrated how united they are without Alexander Isak
  but also how much they miss his goal power. Despite dominating this match,
  before and after Ezri Konsa was sent off for Aston Villa, Eddie Howe’s men had
  to settle for a draw against the side they pipped for a Champions League
  place. “Hey Rob, is that the time already?” says Simon McMahon. “I’ve given up
  going to Dundee’s Sausage &amp; Cider Festival XXL to be at the start of
  another season of clockwatch madness, though I will be having bangers and mash
  and some scrumpy for my tea. “It’s the last sixteen of the Scottish League Cup
  this weekend, with the all premier tie Hearts v St. Mirren being the pick,
  with potential for upsets at Morton, who welcome Aberdeen, and in Perth, where
  St. Johnstone face Motherwell. European giant killers nearly men Dundee United
  travel to Kilmarnock tomorrow, hoping to put Thursday night’s heartbreak
  against Rapid Vienna behind them.” Urgh, commiserations on Thursday; that must
  have been painful. I thought I heard some thunderclaps after the game, which
  was confusing in mid-August, but then I realised it was probably Jim McLean
  effing and jeffing from upstairs. Derby 3-5 Coventry Portsmouth 1-2 Norwich
  Wrexham 2-3 West Brom Sam Smith scored in the 94th minute for Wrexham but they
  couldn’t pull their second injury-time comeback of the week. Portsmouth gave
  Norwich a scare at Fratton Park: Adrian Segecic pulled one back before John
  Swift hit the crossbar with a sizzling volley. No goals at Villa Park, where
  the home side held on for the last quarter with 10 men after Ezri Konsa was
  sent off. GOAL! Derby 3-5 Coventry (Torp 79) Viktor Torp rifles an excellent
  shot through the crowd to give Coventry a two-goal cushion for the first time
  today. GOAL! Wrexham 1-3 West Brom (Price 81) Isaac Price has got his second
  goal, guiding a header into the net from Mikey Johnston’s cross. Mohammed
  Kudus starts for Spurs. the rest of their summer signings, including Joao
  Palhinha, are on the bench. Kyle Walker, Quilindschy Hartman, Jaidon Anthony
  and Martin Dubravka all start for Burnley. Tottenham Hotspur (poss 4-2-3-1)

  Derby 3-4 Coventry (Mason-Clark 75) Ephron Mason-Clark has put Coventry ahead
  again with a superbly deft header at the far post. GOAL! Derby 3-3 Coventry
  (Thomas-Asante 72) Brandon Thomas-Asante has equalised for Coventry in a
  ding-dong thriller at Derby. Hang on, there’s been a seventh goal… GOAL!
  Wrexham 1-2 West Brom (Wallace 74) Jed Wallace has given West Brom the lead at
  the STōK Cae Ras, splashing a shot past Wrexham keeper Danny Ward at the near
  post. New faces galore in the Sunderland team: Granit Xhaka, Habib Diarra,
  Simon Adingra, Reinildo Mandava, Chemsdine Talbi, Noah Sadiki and Robin Roefs
  all make their debuts. West Ham’s new faces are Mads Hermansen in goal and the
  exciting El Hadji Malick Diouf at left wing-back. Sunderland (poss 4-3-3)

  Thomas Partey’s Villarreal debut last night There were no banners, no chants,
  no renewed social media campaign and neither manager was asked to comment on
  Partey after the game. The whistles were not sufficient to be registered by
  everyone. Cadena Ser radio’s local correspondent, who sat high in the main
  stand, reported that he had not heard any. Red card! Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle
  (Konsa sent off) Ezri Konsa has been given a straight red card for dogsoing
  Anthony Gordon. Barry Glendenning has more. Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley (3pm)
  When I was 27 of course I thought I could do everything but I also found out
  that as a leader I am 1,000% better now, so he also needs to learn and become
  better and better, so I will do my best to guide him. His aggression is
  phenomenal. He is fantastic in the duels. When he gives that to the team, he
  can transform the team and give energy to the team so I think that’s extremely
  important. GOAL! Derby 3-2 Coventry (Adams 50) Derby are ahead for the first
  time in what sounds like a bit of a humdinger at Pride Park. Coventry manager
  Frank Lampard may not share that view after watching Ebou Adams put his old
  club ahead. 53 min: Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle No goals at Villa Park, where
  Newcastle had the better of the first half. Barry Glendenning is your man for
  updates on that game, and so much more. Championship latest (12.30pm) Derby
  2-2 Coventry Elder 12, Morris 45+2 pen; Thomas 7, Wright 25 pen Portsmouth 0-2

Niall Ennis, who scored two of Blackpool’s goals, has now been sent off for a dangerous high challenge. 34 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley It sounds like Burnley are coming into the game, albeit without really testing Guglielmo Vicario. 30 min: Brighton 0-0 Fulham Kaoru Mitoma misses the clearest chance to date, heading off target from Matt O’Riley’s cross. 27 min: Sunderland 0-0 West Ham A neat move from West Ham ends with El-Hadji Malick Diouf’s shot being cleared off the line by Dan Ballard. It sounds like that game has been pretty even so far. Championship Luca Kjerrumgaard, a giant Danish forward on loan from Udinese, has scored two goals in five minutes at Vicarage Road. Watford lead QPR 2-0. 23 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley The possession stats – Tottenham have had 81 per cent – are grim reading for Burnley, and lovers of promoted teams more generally. Slightly weird phrase to write, but this is a big season for the promoted teams. Premier League latest Brighton 0-0 Fulham Sunderland 0-0 West Ham Tottenham 1-0 Burnley 17 min: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley A bit of Spurs-adjacent news: Eberechi Eze, a target for Daniel Levy and friends, may miss Crystal Palace’s match at Chelsea tomorrow. You didn’t pick Richarlison, did you? The first Premier League goal of the Thomas Frank era has been scored by Richarlison. Burnley tried to play out from the back, lost the ball and were punished. Mohammed Kudus’s cross bounced up awkwardly towards Richarlison, who adjusted his body to drag an accomplished excellent finish past Martin Dubravka. 6 min: Spurs 0-0 Burnley We’ve had the first eight-second corner of the Premier League season, awarded by Michael Oliver against the Burnley keeper Martin Dubravka. Nothing came of it but you’d imagine those timewasting punishments will become a background feature of the season. Championship match report: Wrexham 2-3 West Brom With the spotlight fixed on their Hollywood infused opposition, it is easily forgettable that West Brom’s Ryan Mason is just lighting the touchpaper on a hopefully lengthy and fruitful managerial career. Mason will know already that he will thrive or fail on his substitutions, and a lunchtime double switch that instantly earned three precious Championship points should boost his confidence. Championship Stoke’s Million Manhoef has put them ahead inside the first minute at Hillsborough. You can follow all the EFL goals as they go in via our live scores page. The three Premier League games are under way. They were all preceded by a minute’s silence in memory of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva. Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, who was racially abused at Anfield last night, has thanked his teammates, the Liverpool players and the match officials for their support last night. Match report: Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle Newcastle demonstrated how united they are without Alexander Isak but also how much they miss his goal power. Despite dominating this match, before and after Ezri Konsa was sent off for Aston Villa, Eddie Howe’s men had to settle for a draw against the side they pipped for a Champions League place. “Hey Rob, is that the time already?” says Simon McMahon. “I’ve given up going to Dundee’s Sausage &amp; Cider Festival XXL to be at the start of another season of clockwatch madness, though I will be having bangers and mash and some scrumpy for my tea. “It’s the last sixteen of the Scottish League Cup this weekend, with the all premier tie Hearts v St. Mirren being the pick, with potential for upsets at Morton, who welcome Aberdeen, and in Perth, where St. Johnstone face Motherwell. European giant killers nearly men Dundee United travel to Kilmarnock tomorrow, hoping to put Thursday night’s heartbreak against Rapid Vienna behind them.” Urgh, commiserations on Thursday; that must have been painful. I thought I heard some thunderclaps after the game, which was confusing in mid-August, but then I realised it was probably Jim McLean effing and jeffing from upstairs. Derby 3-5 Coventry Portsmouth 1-2 Norwich Wrexham 2-3 West Brom Sam Smith scored in the 94th minute for Wrexham but they couldn’t pull their second injury-time comeback of the week.

Referee Sam Barrott (West Yorkshire) Read Sid Lowe on Thomas Partey’s Villarreal debut last night There were no banners, no chants, no renewed social media campaign and neither manager was asked to comment on Partey after the game. The whistles were not sufficient to be registered by everyone. Cadena Ser radio’s local correspondent, who sat high in the main stand, reported that he had not heard any. Red card! Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle (Konsa sent off) Ezri Konsa has been given a straight red card for dogsoing Anthony Gordon. Barry Glendenning has more. Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley (3pm) When I was 27 of course I thought I could do everything but I also found out that as a leader I am 1,000% better now, so he also needs to learn and become better and better, so I will do my best to guide him. His aggression is phenomenal. He is fantastic in the duels. When he gives that to the team, he can transform the team and give energy to the team so I think that’s extremely important. GOAL! Derby 3-2 Coventry (Adams 50) Derby are ahead for the first time in what sounds like a bit of a humdinger at Pride Park. Coventry manager Frank Lampard may not share that view after watching Ebou Adams put his old club ahead. 53 min: Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle No goals at Villa Park, where Newcastle had the better of the first half.
