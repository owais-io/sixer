  Victorian Liberal party deputy leader and former Australian tennis star, Sam
  Groth, has threatened legal action over News Corp stories which claimed
  Liberal colleagues of Groth’s were querying how he began his relationship with
  his wife, Brittany, with his lawyers claiming the articles are worse than
  “gutter journalism”. A legal letter from law firm Giles George alleges two
  articles in the Herald Sun and social media posts published this week
  constitute a serious invasion of Brittany Groth’s privacy under new tort laws,
  which came into force last month. “The article did not amount to ‘news’ and
  did not even have the ‘character of news’ – it was not ‘journalistic
  material’,” the letter from defamation lawyer Patrick George claimed. Sign up:
  AU Breaking News email “It was, at best, malicious gossip which was not even
  investigated ... It would be too kind to describe the article as ‘gutter
  journalism’ because it did not amount to ‘journalism’ at all.” The articles
  are likely to cause serious harm to the MP’s reputation, the letter said.
  According to the letter, the articles were also published by the Courier Mail,
  the Daily Telegraph and the Mercury and promoted on News Corp’s social media
  accounts, and were open for comments by members of the public. The Groths are
  demanding all the articles and posts be removed permanently by 5pm on
  Wednesday and the paper publish an apology which would say in part: “On 29
  July 2025, the Herald Sun published disgraceful gossip about Sam and Brittany
  Groth. The allegations that were published were defamatory, false and
  extremely improper – they should not have been published”. The letter also
  claims that the Groths intend to “pursue legal action against your sources”
  and demands as “a matter of urgency” that the names of those sources be
  provided, along with the retention of “all communications” with them. Sam
  Groth said the publication was “a shock and a disgrace”. “It amounted to
  serious tortious conduct in relation to which we will pursue legal action if
  it cannot be resolved,” he said. “It is shocking that a media company would
  behave this way in 2025 – taking away a woman’s privacy and agency and causing
  her extreme distress as a mother. “This is not just about us. It’s about
  drawing a line in the sand and ensuring that publishers are not allowed to get
  away with defamation and the reckless harm it causes.” The article claimed
  unnamed “Liberal colleagues” had raised concerns with Groth over when the
  couple’s relationship began, as they feared the issue could be weaponised by
  their political opponents. The letter states “we are instructed that no
  colleague, Liberal or otherwise, raised the matter with our client prior to
  your [reporter’s] questions being sent … this was not an issue in the party
  room, or more broadly”. Asked about the report on Tuesday, the premier,
  Jacinta Allan, refused to comment, stating “families shouldn’t be dragged into
  politics”. The Victorian Liberal leader, Brad Battin, said “any attempt to
  besmirch the relationship of Sam, Britt and their children is a disgrace”.
  Groth was elevated to deputy Liberal leader in December after a successful
  spill by Battin against then-leader, John Pesutto, who had lost a defamation
  case brought on by fellow Liberal MP, Moira Deeming. The editor of the Herald
  Sun, Sam Weir, declined to comment when approached by Guardian Australia but
  was quoted in the Herald Sun: “We stand by our reporting on a matter of public
  interest, covering important issues which could have a major impact on
  Victorian politics in the lead-up to an election.”
