  Disney has resolved a legal dispute with actor Gina Carano over her firing
  from The Mandalorian, a spokesperson for Disney unit Lucasfilm said on
  Thursday. Lucasfilm removed Carano from the Star Wars streaming show in 2021
  over social media posts that the company at the time called “abhorrent and
  unacceptable” for “denigrating people based on their cultural and religious
  identities”. The actor, who previously starred in the films Deadpool and
  Haywire and was a mixed-martial-arts fighter, had appeared to compare the
  treatment of conservatives in the US with the dehumanization of Jews in Nazi
  Germany. “Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to
  get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews,
  the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews.
  How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?” she
  posted on Instagram before her firing. The actor, who played Cara Dune, had
  previously faced fan backlash for mocking masks during the Covid pandemic and
  amplifying Donald Trump’s false claim that voter fraud caused his 2020
  election loss to Joe Biden. She was also dropped by her agency, UTA, amid the
  uproar over her online posts. Carano sued Disney for wrongful termination in
  2024 with backing from billionaire Elon Musk. “The truth is I was being hunted
  down from everything I posted to every post I liked because I was not in line
  with the acceptable narrative of the time,” she wrote on Musk’s platform X
  when she announced her lawsuit. In Thursday’s statement, the Lucasfilm
  spokesperson said Carano “was always well respected by her directors,
  co-stars, and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating
  her colleagues with kindness and respect”. “With this lawsuit concluded, we
  look forward to identifying opportunities to work together with Ms Carano in
  the near future,” the spokesperson added. In her lawsuit, Carano alleged
  Disney had required her to meet with an LGBTQ+ rights group, and she had
  refused. After she also refused to meet with a group of LGBTQ+ employees of
  Disney, she was fired, according to the suit, which had accused Disney and
  Lucasfilm of “bullying, discriminatory, and retaliatory actions”. In a
  statement posted on her X account on Thursday, Carano called the settlement
  “the best outcome for all parties involved”, adding: “I hope this brings some
  healing to the force.” She also praised the Tesla billionaire, writing: “I
  want to extend my deepest most heartfelt gratitude to Elon Musk, a man I’ve
  never met, who did this Good Samaritan deed for me in funding my lawsuit.”
  Musk’s former business partner, Peter Thiel, admitted in 2016 that he had
  secretly bankrolled Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker that drove the news
  site out of business. The settlement comes as corporations across the US have
  backed away from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and commitments
  while the Trump administration aggressively targets programs that support
  people of color and LGBTQ+ Americans. Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal
  Communications Commission, who was appointed by Trump, earlier this year said
  the media regulator was opening an investigation into whether the DEI
  practices of Disney and its ABC unit violated employment regulations. Reuters
