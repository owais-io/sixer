  At least 100,000 pro-Palestine marchers, including Julian Assange, the former
  foreign minister Bob Carr and the government MP Ed Husic, have marched across
  Sydney Harbour Bridge in the rain to protest against Israel’s conduct in Gaza
  and to speak out about the children starving there. The world-famous landmark
  was closed to traffic at 11.30am on Sunday, with protesters gathering in Lang
  Park in the city centre before enduring heavy rain as they walked across the
  bridge. The march began at 1pm, with demonstrators eventually stretching the
  entire length of the 1.2km Harbour Bridge. “It’s even bigger than my wildest
  dreams,” one of the main protest organisers, Josh Lees, told Guardian
  Australia while at the front of the march. “It’s a mass march for humanity to
  stop a genocide, our politicians have to now listen to the will of the people
  and sanction Israel.” The march was supposed to end at the US consulate. But
  about 3pm NSW police sent out a mass text message to phones throughout the
  city ordering the pro-Palestine march to stop due to safety concerns, with
  authorities turning protesters around at the north end. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email “Message from NSW Police: In consultation with the organisers, the
  march needs to stop due to public safety and await further instructions,” the
  message read. A police helicopter hovered overhead with a loudspeaker
  delivering instructions for the hordes of protesters to turn around and walk
  back towards the city. Police sent a second mass text message saying they had
  consulted with the organisers and were turning everyone around. Crowd
  estimates varied. NSW police said initial estimates put the crowd at 90,000. A
  spokesperson for rally organisers the Palestine Action Group said police had
  informed them 100,000 people were in attendance – but the spokesperson
  estimated the figure was closer to 300,000. The NSW police acting deputy
  commissioner Peter McKenna told reporters that the protest was the largest he
  and an assistant police commissioner had seen in their time in the force in
  Sydney. “Gee whiz, I wouldn’t like to try and do this every Sunday at that
  short notice,” he said. “At points today, we were really concerned about a
  crowd crush.” The acting assistant commissioner Adam Johnson said: “I can
  honestly say in my 35 years of policing, that was a perilous situation. I’ve
  never seen a more perilous situation.” ‘It’s time for a fundamental change’ At
  the front of the march were a number of high-profile Australians holding a
  sign that read “March for Humanity Save Gaza”. Among them was Assange. It was
  one of the WikiLeaks founder’s few public appearances since he arrived home in
  Australia after a decade-long extradition battle. He was photographed
  alongside Carr, the former NSW premier and federal foreign affairs minister
  who last week told Guardian Australia the federal government should sanction
  the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and move quickly to recognise
  Palestinian statehood. Carr said it would send “a message that we are turned
  inside out with disgust by what appears the deliberate starvation” of Gaza.
  Federal Labor MPs also joined the march, including former minister Husic, the
  member for Cunningham, Alison Byrne, and Senator Tony Sheldon. “People power
  has come out, I think, largely because they just cannot abide the treatment
  that has been seen of little kids,” Husic told Guardian Australia after he
  reiterated calls for the Albanese government to sanction Israel and recognise
  Palestinian statehood. Also at the front were five NSW Labor MPs who announced
  before the march that they would defy their premier, Chris Minns, and attend:
  Stephen Lawrence, Anthony D’Adam, Lynda Voltz, Cameron Murphy and Sarah Kaine.
  More NSW Labor MPs were spotted in the crowd, including two of Minns’
  ministers, Penny Sharpe and Jihad Dib, and MPs Bob Nanva and Peter Primrose.
  Lawrence told Guardian Australia that it was time for the world, and
  Australia, to act. “It’s time for Australia to sanction Israel,” he said. “The
  people have spoken today. They want more action from the Australian government
  to stop the genocide in Palestine.” Asked about the premier not commenting
  since the supreme court on Saturday authorised the march, Lawrence said: “It’s
  time for a fundamental change of position in the Labor party on the right to
  protest – and our approach to this question of Palestinian protests.” It had
  been touch and go whether the protest would, lawfully, be able to go ahead.
  Protest in Australia is not in itself unlawful, with the constitution holding
  the implied right to freedom of communication. But the protesters applied to
  police for legal protections and support, facilitating what they estimated to
  be a protest attended by 10,000 people. Minns said, during the week, that he
  would not support the protest, warning it would cause “chaos”. A march across
  the bridge would have fallen foul of a law against “obstruction” of major
  roads. Protesters could have faced a maximum two years in prison or a $22,000
  fine for blocking the major road under draconian anti-protest laws passed in
  the state in 2022. The police rejected the application and then challenged the
  protesters in the supreme court. Just over 24 hours before the protest was due
  to start, the court sided with the protesters. ‘It was never about traffic’
  Before the march, the Indigenous actor Meyne Wyatt and the former Socceroo and
  Australian of the Year Craig Foster spoke to the crowd alongside the Greens
  senator Mehreen Faruqi. Faruqi, who has been an outspoken critic of the
  federal government’s perceived inaction on Gaza, commended protesters for
  “defying Chris Minns” after the NSW premier said: “We cannot allow Sydney to
  descend into chaos.” “Thank you for defying Chris Minns,” she said. “This is a
  man who wants you to stay home and be silent in the face of a genocide. “It
  was never about logistics. It was never about traffic. It was never about
  communications or anything else. It was always about stopping us and silencing
  us. It was always about protecting Israel and the Labor government from
  accountability.” Protesters turned out carrying pots and pans – to highlight
  the starvation in Gaza – while many carried Palestinian flags and signage
  along with their wet weather gear and umbrellas. People of all ages were in
  the crowd, including children who came along with their families wearing
  ponchos and keffiyehs. One protester, a British man called Dan, held a sign
  reading “Gay Jews 4 Gaza”. “I grew up in a north London Jewish community, and
  I think there’s a widespread Zionism that exists within the Jewish community
  that is difficult to separate from religion,” he said, adding: “I think it’s
  important for people within the community to stand up and raise their voice
  against the state of Israel because they’re not representative of the Jewish
  community as a whole.” Guardian Australia also spoke to Philomena McGoldrick,
  a registered nurse and midwife, who has spent stints working in Gaza and
  described her heartbreak at images circulating of starving children. “Innocent
  babies have no colour, no religion, no language. In this day and age … it’s
  heartbreaking. But it’s nice to meet people standing on the right side. The
  tide has changed.” In Melbourne, pro-Palestinian protesters who had planned to
  shut down King Street Bridge in solidarity with the Sydney protest, appeared
  to have been blocked from crossing the bridge. Video shared on social media by
  the protest organisers showed police in riot gear and shields blocking the
  bridge with trucks. Victoria police were approached to confirm the bridge had
  been shut down; a spokesperson said a statement would be released at the end
  of the day. In Sydney, Transport for NSW urged people to avoid non-essential
  travel around the central business district and northern parts of the city.
