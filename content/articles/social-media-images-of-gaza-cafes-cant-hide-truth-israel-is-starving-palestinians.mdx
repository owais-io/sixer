  Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his supporters have variously
  argued that there is no starvation in Gaza, or that if there is hunger it is
  the fault of Hamas – who they accuse of stealing aid – or the United Nations.
  In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Amit Segal, the chief political
  correspondent for Israel’s Channel 12, said he did not believe there was
  hunger in Gaza. Israel’s consul general in New York said that there was “no
  deliberate starvation in Gaza, only a deliberate disinformation campaign
  orchestrated by Hamas”. Social media has also helped spread misinformation
  about hunger in Gaza, with photographs and video of cafes being presented as
  evidence that there is no famine. One Israeli creator on YouTube with more
  than 400,000 subscribers posted a video entitled “Summer 2025 (Genocide Never
  Tasted So Good)”, which highlights the existence of several small cafes in
  Gaza City in an attempt to disprove the existence of food shortages. But
  Israeli government data clearly shows that it is starving Gaza. UN-backed food
  security experts said that Gaza is currently experiencing a “worst-case
  scenario” famine. Even Netanyahu’s biggest ally, Donald Trump, has said there
  is “real starvation” in the territory. Despite such conclusions, pro-Israeli
  figures have continued to cast doubt on the veracity of images of malnourished
  children. In an interview with Piers Morgan, the US media personality Megyn
  Kelly dismissed such images as having been “manipulated”, before claiming that
  Hamas and “frankly a lot of Palestinians” are “masters of propaganda and
  they’re fine having their own children starve just as long as they can put
  them on camera”. Such attitudes are reflected in the comments under the Gaza
  cafes video, where a typical post reads: “It is hard to imagine that people
  can be so easily fooled into passionately believing the ‘genocide’ and
  ‘famine’ in Gaza when evidence against such false narratives is so readily
  available.” But while a small number of cafes are open in Gaza – including
  some of those in the video – they are operating in a severely limited capacity
  due to spiralling prices and scarcity of key ingredients, according to Salah
  Ahmad, the co-founder of HopeHub, an organization that created co-working
  spaces for remote workers and students in cafes across the territory. Basic
  ingredients are hard to obtain, and prices fluctuate wildly from day to day: a
  kilo of flour can cost $12 one day, and $40 the next. Consequently, the small
  array of snacks these cafes are able to still offer are usually extremely
  expensive, Ahmad said. “When you see a small coffee shop or cafe selling
  drinks or cakes at high prices, it does not truly reflect the reality most
  people in Gaza are living,” Ahmad said. “In many cases, it is just a small
  business. The owners are simply trying to survive and feed their families with
  a sense of dignity.” Of the five cafes in the video, one was not currently
  open because they ran out of supplies, one said it was reopening after being
  shut down for several weeks because there were no supplies, and another said
  it was no longer selling food, Ahmad said. Often, cafes in Gaza remain open
  even when they do not offer food, as they provide internet connections and
  electricity from solar panels, Ahmad said. HopeHub is still operating two
  co-working spaces out of cafes – one in Khan Younis and one in Deir al-Balah.
  Further confusion has been created by the fact that some of the cafes are
  posting pictures and videos from before they closed down on. Hamada Ice Cream
  shop, which has not been open for weeks, recently posted a highlight reel of
  the pastries, cakes and drinks the cafe once served. “Me and 2 million Gazans
  are waiting for this moment Oh God, make things easy and these days pass
  safely, O Lord,” reads the video’s Arabic caption. The few cafes that are open
  are obviously not able to serve Gaza’s entire population, Ahmad said. “Most
  people in Gaza right now are poor and trying to survive,” he said. Those who
  do go to the cafes “might be employees who still receive salaries from
  international organizations, remote workers, or journalists”, he said. “They
  are holding on to hope, clinging to familiar routines, trying to stay
  connected to their memories of a more beautiful Gaza. For them, going out for
  a coffee is not about luxury. It is about staying human.”
