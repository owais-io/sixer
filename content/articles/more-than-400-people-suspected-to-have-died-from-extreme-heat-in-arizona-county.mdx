  More than 400 people are suspected to have died from extreme heat in Maricopa
  county, Arizona, so far this summer, according to official figures, as the
  brutal current heatwave enters its 12th day. August is on track to be the
  hottest on record, with temperatures hitting at least 110F (43C) every day
  apart from one so far. As of 11 August, at least three daily records had been
  broken including an all-time monthly high of 118F (48C), as well as several
  night-time record temperatures, according to Isaac Smith, meteorologist at the
  National Weather Service (NWS) in Phoenix. The current extreme heat warning
  issued by the NWS is the fourth and longest of the summer thus far, and will
  extend at least through Wednesday night with temperatures forecast to hit
  110F. Increased cloud cover and possible thunderstorms will then bring a brief
  respite towards the weekend but another very hot spell is forecast by the
  start of next week. Maricopa county is home to Phoenix, the fifth largest and
  hottest major US city, as well as several smaller urban hubs dotted amid the
  Sonora desert including Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa. Midway through the hot
  season, the current official death count – including suspected and confirmed
  heat-related fatalities – is about 30% lower than this time last year, the
  second deadliest on record. In 2025, the county medical examiner’s office has
  so far confirmed only 35 heat deaths – 17 directly caused by exposure to high
  temperatures, and 18 cases where heat contributed to the fatality, including
  by exacerbating chronic medical conditions or the effects of alcohol or
  methamphetamine. Another 369 suspected heat-related deaths remain under
  investigation, according to the county’s heat surveillance dashboard which is
  updated weekly. June and July were a little cooler than recent years, despite
  topping 115F on multiple days, which at least partially explains the lower
  death toll. Improved access and extended hours at city cooling centres may
  also be playing a role, according to Dr Nick Staab, the county’s chief medical
  officer. First responders and hospitals have reportedly gotten better at
  treating heatstroke and other temperature-related emergencies. Yet despite the
  encouraging numbers, Maricopa county is still on track to be the deadliest
  place for heat in the US after New York City, the country’s largest
  metropolis, where heat contributes to 525 deaths on average each year. “With
  this many cases still under investigation and it only being mid-August,
  there’s a lot that could still happen,” Staab told KJZZ, the local public
  radio station. Heat-related deaths have soared in Maricopa county over the
  past decade, with 645 in 2023 compared to 61 in 2014. The county has become
  increasingly unlivable for many amid record-breaking heatwaves driven by the
  global climate crisis, unchecked urban sprawl and an affordable housing crisis
  – which combined with patchy mental health and substance misuse services has
  contributed to a growing unsheltered population. Last year, heat deaths fell
  for the first time in a decade to 608, according to official figures, but the
  city and county have since come under fire for alleged undercounting. A recent
  investigation by the local TV station ABC15 identified multiple cases in which
  heat was discounted as a factor despite the person dying in extreme
  temperatures. “People are dying awful, preventable deaths that are not being
  accounted for in the official figures. We need more consistency and
  transparency if we’re going to wrap solutions around this public health
  crisis,” said Stacey Champion, a community advocate campaigning for more
  standardized counting of heat-related deaths in Arizona. Neither the city nor
  the county responded immediately to questions surrounding the official death
  toll. Heat is the deadliest weather phenomenon. But every heat death is
  preventable, and often indicates a lack of access to adequate shelter, cooling
  and/or health, addiction and social services. So far this year, three-quarters
  of heat-related deaths have occurred outside, where temperatures in the most
  built-up, least shady parts of Phoenix can be 20 or 30F higher on the sidewalk
  than the NWS’s airport weather station. Unhoused people account for 40% of
  deaths, while substance misuse contributed to two-thirds. June was the 11th
  warmest on record, and July the ninth hottest. The city, county and state have
  sought to tackle the increasingly unlivable summer environment through tree
  canopy initiatives, cooling technologies and an expansion of cooling centres
  among other policies – in part with the help of Biden-era programs and funds.
  But there is little or no hope of ongoing federal support under the Trump
  administration, which is dismantling environmental justice programs, climate
  change research and mitigation efforts, as well as access to healthcare, food
  stamps (Snap) and other social safety nets. Currently one in four heat deaths
  in the county occur indoors, and energy costs are predicted to rise
  significantly under Trump which risks making Maricopa county and beyond even
  more deadly as summers get hotter. Meanwhile firefighters are struggling to
  control at least five major wildfires across the state, which have so far
  burnt about 180,000 acres. Hot, dry and windy conditions are fuelling the
  flames in Arizona – as well as fires in California, Utah, Colorado and large
  swathes of Canada.
