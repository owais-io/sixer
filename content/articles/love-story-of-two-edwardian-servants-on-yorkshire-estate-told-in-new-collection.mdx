  He was a valet, she was a kitchen maid and more than a century ago they met
  because of his passion for photography and desperate need of a warm place to
  use as a makeshift studio. Alf Edwards and Caroline Palmer worked at opposite
  ends of an imposing country house, set in a huge estate with hundreds of
  employees, and there was little other reason for their paths to cross. But
  they did and they fell in love and married despite everyone advising them not
  to. The poignant, Edwardian below-stairs love story of Alf and Caroline is
  revealed in what English Heritage says is the most significant and biggest
  donation of objects relating to servants that it has ever received. The
  couple’s grandson Gordon Edwards donated more than 60 objects, which include
  photographs, letters, postcards and personal items such as Alf’s camera,
  Caroline’s gold watch and a handmade engagement present. They document a story
  that could be a plot line from Downton Abbey, and add more widely to
  understanding of life at Brodsworth Hall, near Doncaster, a Victorian country
  house once owned by the “shoot-in-winter, yacht-in-summer” Thellusson family.
  “It is a fabulous story and a fabulous group of objects,” said Eleanor
  Matthews, English Heritage’s curator of collections and interiors.
  “Collections like this just don’t survive.” Matthews said Brodsworth had
  always been very good at telling the stories of people who worked at the
  house. “But having objects that the servants owned, used, looked at, had in
  their rooms whilst they were working at the house … that just makes it
  super-special.” Alf and Caroline were the employees of Charles and Constance
  Thellusson, whose ancestor Peter Thellusson had bought the Brodsworth estate
  in 1791. Peter Thellusson had amassed a huge fortune, a substantial part of it
  linked to the transatlantic slave economy. When he died he left what has been
  described as “one of the most spectacularly vindictive wills in British
  history”, with the bulk of it left in trust for as yet unborn descendants. The
  current Brodsworth Hall was built between 1861-63 and survives, virtually
  unchanged, as a mid-Victorian vision of a comfortable country house. It was
  here, as the first world war loomed, that Alf and Caroline met because of his
  enthusiasm for photography. They began courting and were quickly engaged,
  perhaps because of the times. Many men employed at Brodsworth were conscripted
  but Alf, because of ill-health, was unable to sign up. Soon Caroline was
  promoted to cook at Brodsworth and Alf took on extra duties including becoming
  chauffeur. His poor health led everyone to advise the couple not to marry and
  they briefly separated. But the parting was too much and on 17 July 1916 they
  married and had three happy years, during which time Caroline gave birth to
  two boys, before Alf died from tuberculosis aged 34. Matthews said Caroline
  lived a long life and always talked fondly of her time at Brodsworth. The
  donated objects include Alf’s camera, made by Eastman Kodak of Rochester New
  York and possibly purchased on a trip he took to the east coast of the US with
  the Thellussons in 1914. There is also what is thought to be Alf’s engagement
  present to Caroline – a wooden picture frame handcarved by him with a good
  luck message and a horse shoe fixed to it. A number of the objects have now
  gone on display at the house and the hope is they may help to unlock other
  stories. Matthews said the trove included the earliest image of staff at the
  estate. “Hopefully in time we will be able to identify them all,” she said.
  “These beautiful, poignant items tell a story largely unknown to us until now
  and, thanks to the donation, we are able to add another layer of understanding
  to the rich fabric of Brodsworth’s history.” While the collection is
  catalogued and conserved, a few select pieces including Alf’s camera, the
  carved wooden stool, three pipes, first world war registration cards,
  postcards, and Caroline’s wedding wristwatch will go on display for the first
  time at Brodsworth Hall from Wednesday.
