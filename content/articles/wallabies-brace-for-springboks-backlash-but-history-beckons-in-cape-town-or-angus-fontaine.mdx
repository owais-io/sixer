  The Wallabies didn’t just defeat the Springboks last weekend, they humiliated
  them. Now comes the reckoning. The bear has been poked, the Springbok
  spit-roasted. South Africa’s coach Rassie Erasmus has swung the axe with 10
  changes to the side that coughed up a 22-0 lead and allowed 38 unanswered
  points inside an hour. The widely held view is that rugby’s world order will
  be brutally restored in this weekend’s return Test in Cape Town. The two-time
  world champions will crush their impetuous rivals and resume their mantle as
  rugby’s No 1 team after last week’s boilover saw them slip down the rankings
  to No 3 below New Zealand and Ireland. But that presumption discounts the
  brilliance and character of the Australian victory. Full of brio and
  battle-fit after smashing the Lions in Sydney earlier this month, Joe
  Schmidt’s men dismantled South Africa in the final hour of the first Test. Not
  only did the Wallabies stay calm to reel in the home side’s big lead, they
  romped away in imperious style, with sidesteps and short balls. Fitter,
  faster, full of belief. And while Erasmus has awesome depth to draw on,
  Australia will field arguably a stronger side for the rematch. Their most
  dynamic ball-runner, Rob Valetini, returns and Super Rugby’s fastest man,
  Brumbies flyer Corey Toole, will debut on the wing setting up a tantalising
  duel with South Africa’s own pocket rocket Cheslin Kolbe. Toole’s time in
  sevens rugby has given him an ability to improvise akin to Kolbe’s. And with
  veteran halves James O’Connor and Nic White having ignited the Wallabies’
  attack and Brumbies teammates Len Ikitau and Tom Wright in career-best form,
  the 25-year-old could prove a weapon every bit as potent as fellow wing Max
  Jorgensen. Conversely, South Africa will run out new halves, centres and wing
  pairings. Grant Williams survives to link with Handre Pollard as the new 9-10,
  with Kolbe and Canan Moodie the new wingers and 100-Test fullback Willie le
  Roux recalled. At inside centre Damian de Allende returns to partner new
  captain Jesse Kriel. “We know where we went wrong,” Erasmus said, shrugging
  off the loss of captain Siya Kolisi (knee) and Pieter-Steph du Toit
  (concussion). “So we made a few changes that we believe will offer us what we
  need for this game. We let ourselves and the country down, so we have all the
  motivation we need to make things right.” With captain Harry Wilson’s dicky
  knee not risked and frontrow generals James Slipper and Allan Alaalatoa also
  sidelined, Australia also have a new skipper in Fraser McReight. The flanker’s
  steal in the 18th minute halted the Springbok’s first Test onslaught,
  steadying the ship to allow the Wallabies’ own guns to blaze. And blaze they
  must again on Sunday. No Australian side has won at Cape Town in seven Tests
  across 33 years. But McReight’s men have the chance to echo the deeds of the
  fabled 1963 Wallabies captained by John Thornett who won at Johannesburg and
  Cape Town to consign the Springboks to their first consecutive defeats at home
  since 1896. Like Schmidt’s men, that 1963 Wallabies side was a team emerging
  from a dark era. The 1950s were a low ebb for Australian rugby, as rugby
  league boomed worldwide. The 1951 Bledisloe Cup drew 22,000 across three home
  games in Australia while 67,000 leaguies flocked to a single Test in the
  Kangaroos’ series against France. Thornett’s side returned rugby to relevance
  by first beating England – Australia’s first win over a major nation at home
  in 29 years. Then came their ambush on the Veldt. Smashed 14-3 in Pretoria and
  derided as “incompetents”, the Wallabies roared back with a 9-5 win in Cape
  Town that Thornett called “the greatest day of my life”, a claim usurped the
  very next week at Ellis Park, when they swept to a historic 11-9 triumph. Then
  as now, South Africa considered themselves the greatest rugby team on Earth.
  And the shame the nation felt at the capitulation in Johannesburg – even
  Erasmus’s mother texted him to say ‘My kid, I still love you’ – will fuel
  their fire for Cape Town. Australia are rising fast and fizzing with talent
  but this is their greatest challenge yet. If the Wallabies are serious about
  winning the Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup this year and ultimately, the
  2027 World Cup at home, it starts in the early hours of Sunday morning
  Australian time. To be the best they must beat the beast. Back-to-back wins
  over the world champions at their fortresses sends a mighty statement - one to
  send shockwaves through the game.
