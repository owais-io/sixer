  A contractor linked to the UK Ministry of Defence has been hit by a
  cyber-attack, exposing personal data linked to Afghan resettlement efforts. It
  is the latest in a series of breaches involving the private information of
  Afghan refugees. The breach at Inflite The Jet Centre Ltd, a company that
  provides ground services for flights linked to the UK’s defence ministry and
  the Cabinet Office, has exposed the personal data of up to 3,700 people,
  including Afghans seeking refuge as part of the Afghan Relocations and
  Assistance Policy. All the individuals affected by the breach flew into London
  Stansted airport between January and March 2024. The leak may have also
  released the information of civil servants, soldiers on routine exercises and
  journalists. In a statement on its website, Inflite The Jet Centre Ltd
  confirmed that a data breach had occurred involving “access to a limited
  number of company emails”. The company said the incident had been reported to
  the Information Commissioner’s Office, and that it was working with the
  National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre on its
  investigation. “We believe the scope of the incident was limited to email
  accounts only, however, as a precautionary measure, we have contacted our key
  stakeholders whose data may have been affected during the period of January to
  March 2024”, the statement said. It isn’t yet clear who carried out the
  cyber-attack on the company’s databases but a message was sent to the affected
  people warning them of the breach. A government spokesperson said: “We were
  recently notified that a third-party sub-contractor to a supplier experienced
  a cybersecurity incident involving unauthorised access to a small number of
  its emails that contained basic personal information. “We take data security
  extremely seriously and are going above and beyond our legal duties in
  informing all potentially affected individuals. “The incident has not posed
  any threat to individuals’ safety, nor compromised any government systems.”
  The data is not believed to have been leaked to the dark web or made public.
  In February 2022, a separate breach by a defence official disclosed the
  personal data of 18,714 Afghans who had worked with British forces. The UK
  high court granted a superinjunction to the Conservative government in 2023 to
  suppress information related to the breach, for which the Labour defence
  secretary, John Healey, later issued an apology.
