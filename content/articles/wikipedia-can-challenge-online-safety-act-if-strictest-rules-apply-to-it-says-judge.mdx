  The operator of Wikipedia has been given permission by a high court judge to
  challenge the Online Safety Act if it is categorised as a high-risk platform,
  which would impose the most stringent duties. The Wikimedia Foundation has
  said it might be forced to reduce how many people can access the site in order
  to comply with the regulations if it is classified as a category 1 provider by
  Ofcom later this summer. As a non-profit, the site said, it “would face huge
  challenges to meet the large technological and staffing needs” required to
  comply with the duties, which include user-verification requirements,
  stringent protections for users and regular reporting responsibilities to
  prevent the spread of harmful content. The Wikimedia Foundation calculated
  that the number of people in the UK who access Wikipedia would have to be
  reduced by about three-quarters in order for the site to not qualify as a
  category 1 service, which is defined as a large user-to-user platform that
  uses algorithmic contender recommendations. It said Wikipedia was different to
  other sites expected to be labelled as category 1 providers, such as Facebook,
  X and Instagram, because it was run by a charity and its users typically only
  encountered content that they sought out. Mr Justice Johnson refused
  Wikipedia’s legal challenge in the high court on several grounds, but he noted
  that the site “provides significant value for freedom of speech and
  expression” and added that the outcome did not give Ofcom or the government “a
  green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia’s
  operations”. Any decision to make Wikipedia a category 1 provider would have
  to be “justified as proportionate if it were not to amount to a breach of the
  right to freedom of expression”, he said, but he added that it would be
  “premature” to rule on this since Ofcom had not yet determined that Wikipedia
  was a category 1 service. If Ofcom determines that Wikipedia is a category 1
  service and this means Wikipedia is unable to operate as at present, Johnson
  suggested that the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, should “consider whether
  to amend the regulations or to exempt categories of service from the act” and
  said Wikipedia could bring a further challenge if he did not. Phil
  Bradley-Schmieg, the lead counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, said: “While
  the decision does not provide the immediate legal protections for Wikipedia
  that we hoped for, the court’s ruling emphasised the responsibility of Ofcom
  and the UK government to ensure Wikipedia is protected as the OSA [Online
  Safety Act] is implemented. “The judge recognised the ‘significant value’ of
  Wikipedia, its safety for users, as well as the damages that wrongly assigned
  OSA categorisations and duties could have on the human rights of Wikipedia’s
  volunteer contributors.” Cecilia Ivimy KC, for the government, said ministers
  had reviewed Ofcom guidance and considered specifically whether Wikipedia
  should be exempt from the regulations and rejected that. She said they had
  decided that Wikipedia “is in principle an appropriate service on which to
  impose category 1 duties”, and how ministers had arrived at that choice was
  not “without reasonable foundation nor irrational”. A government spokesperson
  said: “We welcome the high court’s judgment today, which will help us continue
  our work implementing the Online Safety Act to create a safer online world for
  everyone.”
