  Our world is getting hotter. Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re
  stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home
  working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common. Get a good fan
  and you can dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly
  effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how
  we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for
  a great fan instead. Fans are much more energy efficient than aircon. A
  typical portable air conditioner uses 1,000W of electricity, which would cost
  about 26p an hour to run. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my
  favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on
  max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon)
  than a single aircon unit going for an hour. I tested 15 fans of all shapes
  and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size,
  noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a
  few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you
  while using significantly less energy than aircon. Due to recent heatwaves,
  stock is running low on many of these models – we’ve marked up any that are
  out of stock at the time of publication. *** Still in stock Best misting fan:

  ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20i £339 at Amazon *** Why you should trust me I’m an
  award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing
  gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember
  the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate to wild
  swimming in middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply
  qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and
  subjectively. How I tested I chose 15 fans, each from different brands, aiming
  for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted
  to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their
  paces. I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore
  money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they
  generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on
  the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest). I
  measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably
  position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you.
  That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more. I also measured them
  myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For
  example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find
  that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest
  dimensions, including their footprint. I used a thermometer to measure the
  impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from
  how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the
  controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed
  away, as well as the price tag. All the fans that weren’t returned to the
  manufacturers were donated to Furnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the
  empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic
  abuse. *** The best fans in 2025 *** Best fan overall: AirCraft Lume £149 at
  AirCraft Preorder now for delivery during week commencing 22 September This
  pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable
  backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote
  control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and
  down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan.
  There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features
  include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode. Of all I tested, this is probably
  the best fan for sleeping: it’s the best for low noise relative to wind speed.
  Pick a lower setting for silent cooling, a higher setting if you’re happy to
  doze off to the white noise, or use the sleep button if you’d like it to
  gradually reduce power in the night. I found the lower settings cooling enough
  to get to sleep on a hot night during a heatwave. Why we love it When I’m
  working from home or relaxing (I can’t say chilling out when it’s 30C+), the
  AirCraft Lume is the fan that I reach for. I love it for many reasons. It’s
  light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability:
  it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter
  because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost
  plastic-free. It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can
  circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan
  can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) result was the best on
  test, and you can really feel it. During a recent heatwave, I found the
  powerful breeze genuinely cooling. And it’s quiet: in fact, I can’t hear it at
  all on levels 1-5, so I need to be careful that I remember to turn off the fan
  when I step away. All for a reasonable price, too. It’s a shame that … there’s
  nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use. Style: pedestal (or
  desk) Dimensions: 37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 12 Remote control?
  Yes Peak noise level on test: 55dB Power use on top setting: 18W Air speed on
  top setting: 5.9 metres a second (m/s) *** Best budget fan and best desk fan:
  Devola desk fan £59.95 at Devola £59.95 at AirconCentre Currently out of stock
  This affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and
  powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and
  sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal
  oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad
  for a humble desk fan. Why we love it It’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a
  substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was among the best on
  test. It certainly felt cooling. I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three
  of its nine speeds, despite being powerfully cooling, and even when the noise
  got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying. In fact, while the
  AirCraft Lume is my favourite bedside fan, the Devola perched on a bedside
  table does a good job on a budget. It’s powerfully cooling, inaudible on lower
  settings (1-3 out of 9) and on high settings, the white noise is OK to go to
  sleep to. Just don’t use the sleep setting: it’s noisier than it should be, so
  picking a medium setting worked best. Even the high settings provide a level
  of white noise I could go to sleep to. It’s a shame that … the display is on
  the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was
  no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward
  to use. Style: desk Dimensions: 30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 9
  Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 50dB Power use on top setting:
  16W Air speed on top setting: 4m/s *** Best misting fan: Shark FlexBreeze Pro
  Mist FA300UK £199.99 at Shark £249.99 at John Lewis This Shark model is much
  more than a pedestal fan. You can remove the pole to convert it to a desk fan.
  You can unplug it for cordless use. You can even add the included five-litre
  water tank for misting outdoors. And you can do any permutation of these
  things. The design is great, and the remote control stows on the back
  magnetically. Despite its misting feature, it’s not technically an evaporative
  cooler, since you can only use it with water outdoors. It sprays a fine mist
  of water into the air in front of the fan: you get cool, but everything gets a
  bit damp. Why we love it It’s incredibly versatile. Plug it in for everyday
  use, then carry it elsewhere (there’s a large top handle) to use as a cordless
  fan, or for a cooling mist on the patio while you’re entertaining outdoors.
  The cordless runtime is quoted as two to 24 hours, depending on fan speed, and
  charging time is five to six hours. Power use was impressively low: 14W on the
  top fan setting, 7W to charge the battery, 21W to do both at once. I compared
  it with the test-winning AirCraft Lume, which costs £70 less. Both are a
  similar size and design. The Shark has fewer fan speeds: five as opposed to
  the AirCraft’s 12. The design looks similar, but the head of the Shark is much
  deeper (33cm compared with 15cm). And it only oscillates side to side rather
  than up and down; you can point it at various angles, though. At 4.7m/s, the
  top air speed is impressive, although not quite as high as the AirCraft’s.
  It’s quiet enough that you can’t even hear it on the first two of its five
  speeds, whereas peak volume is exactly the same as the AirCraft. Is it worth
  £70 more? If you’ll make use of it being cordless or plan to use it outdoors,
  then yes. If not, stick with the AirCraft. It’s a shame that … the misting can
  only be used outside. Style: pedestal (or desk) Dimensions: 35 x 35 x 95cm
  (WDH) Number of speeds: 5 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 55dB
  Power use on top setting: 21W Air speed on top setting: 4.7m/s *** Best tower
  fan: Dreo Cruiser TF518 £99.99 at Amazon £109.99 with wifi voice control at
  B&amp;Q Currently out of stock This tower fan is slim but striking in black.
  Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode
  where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan
  speed depending on the room temperature. Why we love it At full blast, the
  Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two
  lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze.
  I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one
  hand. It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top
  whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s
  powerful cooling made it forgivable. It’s a shame that … its energy
  consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but
  still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote
  control. Style: tower Dimensions: 32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 9
  Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 60dB Power use on top setting:
  29W Air speed on top setting: 3.6m/s *** Best travel fan: Morphy Richards Air
  Flex USB fan £39.99 at Morphy Richards Currently out of stock £37.21 at Amazon
  Preorder for delivery between 30 August and 3 October This is the fan you can
  take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down
  small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest
  person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you
  a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17
  hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk
  or even a power bank for more juice. Why we love it The 2.6m/s air speed can’t
  compete with the big fans on test – and it wasn’t the one I reached for during
  a heatwave – but that’s not what it’s for. It’s an electric fan that can go
  anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even
  hang it on the wall, if you wish. It’s rechargeable and you can even use it
  with a USB power bank to keep it running anywhere, so you can cool down in a
  tent or on the train. Far better than a handheld fan. I’d definitely take this
  fan on holiday. There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode”
  that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90
  degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three
  speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying. It’s a shame that … air
  speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s
  instead of 2.6m/s) Style: desk Dimensions: 18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH) Number of
  speeds: 3 Remote control? No Peak noise level on test: 35dB Power use on top
  setting: 8W Air speed on top setting: 2.6m/s *** Best evaporative cooler: Swan
  Nordic air cooler £69.99 at Swan £69.99 at Amazon Currently out of stock The
  air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because
  it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre
  reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan,
  too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy efficient than air conditioning,
  so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on
  a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity). Why we love it Of the
  two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the
  temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than
  30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like
  aircon. I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you
  can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results. The
  breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste:
  some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while
  others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as
  the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking,
  too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters,
  so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and
  timer. It’s a shame that … you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded
  like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo. I also found myself
  reaching for a fan on a hot day – it provides a light breeze, not a blast of
  wind. But the air that it puts out is genuinely cooler than the rest of the
  air in the room. Style: tower Dimensions: 29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH) Number of
  speeds: 24 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 45dB Power use on top
  setting: 26W Air speed on top setting: 0.9m/s Searching for more inspiration?

  *** Levoit classic tower fan £89.99 at Amazon Preorder for delivery on 3
  September-10 October Best for: a quieter tower fan This produces a narrow beam
  of air, so you need to point it at you just right or set it to oscillate (90
  degrees). It’s billed as a “20dB silent tower fan”, and it’s inaudible on the
  lowest four of its 12 speeds, but it was considerably louder at top whack.
  It’s good-looking, and I liked the space in the back to stow the remote
  control. There’s a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode, too. It didn’t make the
  final cut because … for the same price, the Dreo is more powerful, which is
  what you need on a really hot day. Style: tower; dimensions: 29 x 29 x 92cm

  Vortex Air Pro Plus £159.99 at Vortex Air Best for: style, and its all-in-one
  heater and fan design Vortex Air bladeless fans look modern, very Dyson-esque,
  and this one comes in 10 colour combos. It’s useful year-round, too, doubling
  as a fan heater. But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too
  tall for a desk fan. There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71
  degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d
  want to point it completely down. The touch controls are at the base, which
  isn’t very practical if it’s on the floor, and the display was a bit hard to
  see. It didn’t make the final cut because … I found the noise a bit annoying;
  I could hear it at levels 2-10. Style: tower; dimensions: 25 x 24 x 65cm
  (WDH); number of speeds: 10; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test:
  35dB; power use on top setting: 28W; air speed on top setting: 2.9m/s ***
  Honeywell 10-litre evaporative air cooler £109.99 at B&amp;Q Currently out of
  stock Best for: a quiet evaporative cooler A chunky tower fan with an extra
  skill: you can turn on evaporative cooling, using water to cool down the air
  it puts out. Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the
  grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too. I liked its large
  (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong
  enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough. I tried it several times,
  and in half an hour, it never managed to cool the area in front by a degree.
  It didn’t make the final cut because … it didn’t cool the room down enough.
  Style: tower; dimensions: 31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH); number of speeds: 3; remote
  control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 30dB; power use on top setting: 39W;
  air speed on top setting: 1.8m/s *** Shark TurboBlade TF200SUK £249.99 at
  Electricshop £249.99 at Amazon Preorder for delivery on 8 September Best for:
  pointing in two directions at once This bladeless fan’s unusual T-shaped
  design has arms that stick out left and right, each putting out air, or you
  can turn them by 90 degrees for a tall, thin fan. You can angle each arm
  independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can
  oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to
  the top with a strong magnet. It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying:
  it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the
  most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at
  the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con. It didn’t
  make the final cut because … I hated the noise it makes. Style: pedestal;
  dimensions: 80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode;
  number of speeds: 10; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 35dB;
  power use on top setting: 60W; air speed on top setting: 3.1m/s *** Duux
  Whisper Flex 2 £166.65 at Amazon Best for: smart controls This took quite a
  bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk
  fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an
  app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven
  schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless.
  It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I
  found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards,
  so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote
  very accurately at it. I did like the compostable packaging. But unusually, it
  drew far too much power (2W) on standby. Less than 1W is the norm. It didn’t
  make the final cut because … of the annoying controls. Style: pedestal;

  peak noise level on test: 40dB; power use on top setting: 9W; air speed on top
  setting: 3.1m/s *** VonHaus air circulator desk fan £69.99 at VonHaus Best
  for: room-filling breeze This desk fan has a display and touch controls on the
  front. And it oscillates well: it turns 90 degrees vertically, 80 degrees
  horizontally or both together to create a room-filling breeze. I couldn’t hear
  the lowest five of its 12 speeds, either. It looks good, and the controls are
  easy to use. Features include a one- to 12-hour timer and a sleep mode that
  decreases fan speed every 30 minutes through the night. It didn’t make the
  final cut because … I liked the Devola desk fan even more, but this is a solid
  buy too. Style: desk; dimensions: 30 x 21 x 36cm (WDH); number of speeds: 12;
  remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 45dB; power use on top setting:
  13W; air speed on top setting: 2.7m/s *** Dyson Cool CF1 £249 at John Lewis
  £249.99 at Debenhams Best for: looks and design You can see a lot of thought
  has gone into the CF1’s design. Not just its simple, circular air multiplier,
  but every single detail. The display is small but very readable. The
  oscillation (15, 40 or 70 degrees) works well. The magnetic storage on top for
  the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set
  the timer and sleep mode. I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six
  of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher
  speeds. It didn’t make the final cut because … the price is hard to justify.
  Money no object? Go for it! Style: desk; dimensions: 36 x 16 x 55cm (WDH);

  Sefte 8in portable air circulator £79.99 at Meaco £89.99 at John Lewis
  Currently out of stock Best for: a cordless fan This is an impressive,
  cordless desk fan with a battery life of four to 17 hours, depending on fan
  speed. I couldn’t hear the first seven of its 12 speeds. It oscillates and you
  can manually point it up or down, and features include a timer, night and eco
  modes. Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two). Overall, I
  liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when
  cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s
  when I unplugged it. Still, if you want a desk fan that can sometimes be
  cordless, it’s a good buy. It didn’t make the final cut because … the
  USB-powered Morphy Richards is even handier. Style: desk; dimensions: 26 x 20
  x 38cm (WDH); number of speeds: 12; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on
  test: 55dB; power use on top setting: 10W; air speed on top setting: 4.6m/s
  *** Blueair ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20i £339 at Amazon Best for: hay fever and
  allergy sufferers This is also a fan heater (so it’s useful all year round)
  and an air purifier (ideal for allergy sufferers). It cleans the air in a room
  in 12.5 minutes or a small house in an hour, removing airborne particles such
  as pollen, odours, dust and smoke. On test, it created a good breeze, even
  though the anemometer only read 0.8m/s. And on cooler days, it can send
  purified air upwards instead, circulating air in the room as well as cleaning
  it. The controls and display are on top, making them hard to see from across
  the room. But there’s an app and Alexa control as well as a remote. The
  three-year warranty is nice, too. It didn’t make the final cut because … it’s
  expensive as a fan (but great as an air purifier). Style: tower; dimensions:
  24 x 24 x 50cm (WDH); number of speeds: 4; remote control? Yes; peak noise

  0.8m/s *** What you need to know *** What are the different types of fan?
  Pedestal fans are tall fans where all the hard work happens at the top. They
  don’t have to be old-fashioned; some have modern designs. And some are
  convertible, with a pole you can remove to turn them into a desk fan. They can
  be good for a focused blast of cooling wind. Bladeless fans aren’t magic; they
  just don’t have visible blades. The work is done in the body of the fan, and
  then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, VortexAir and Shark on test are
  all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving
  parts on show, meaning zero chance of getting your hair caught. Tower fans are
  tall and narrow. They produce a lot of wind and oscillate from side to side,
  making them good for a room like an office. Desk fans are like pedestal fans
  without the pole. They’re not only for desks, they’re good on a bedside table
  too. And they take up less storage space over the winter. Evaporative coolers
  use water from a reservoir to cool the air that blows at you. They don’t
  produce a powerful wind like a fan, but they genuinely cool the room and are
  much more energy efficient than air conditioning. Note that they only cool the
  room a little – they won’t turn it fridge cold like aircon. What does
  oscillation mean? Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on
  their base, and some let you select how wide an angle you want. If it’s just
  for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide.
  Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres.
  Some also oscillate up and down, so the fan can circulate air all over the
  room to create a gentle breeze. What’s sleep mode? Most fans have a sleep
  mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches
  a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without
  wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night
  suddenly cold. Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t
  find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful
  at bedtime. Then switch to sleep mode. Where is the best place to position a
  fan? For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is
  because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your
  skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s
  like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a
  river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative
  coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air.
  Never place a fan up against a wall because air needs to flow into the back.
  If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to
  bring in the cooler air. How much does a fan cost to use? I’ll set out the
  maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in
  watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you
  were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to
  convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh. The energy price cap for 1 July to 30
  September 2025 is 25.73p per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll
  discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to
  run it for five hours every day for a year. Running fans is pretty cheap,
  then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air
  conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to aircon. The two I
  tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use about 3% of the
  electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1,000W). The effect isn’t

Our world is getting hotter. Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common. Get a good fan and you can dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for a great fan instead. Fans are much more energy efficient than aircon. A typical portable air conditioner uses 1,000W of electricity, which would cost about 26p an hour to run. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon) than a single aircon unit going for an hour. I tested 15 fans of all shapes and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you while using significantly less energy than aircon. Due to recent heatwaves, stock is running low on many of these models – we’ve marked up any that are out of stock at the time of publication. *** Still in stock Best misting fan: Shark FlexBreeze Pro Mist FA300UK £199.99 at Shark Best for style: Vortex Air Pro Plus £159.99 at Vortex Air Best for pointing in two directions at once: Shark TurboBlade TF200SUK £249.99 at Electric Shop Best for smart controls: Duux Whisper Flex £166.65 at Amazon Best for room-filling breeze: VonHaus air circulator desk fan £69.99 at VonHaus Best for looks and design: Dyson Cool CF1 £249 at John Lewis Best for hay fever and allergy sufferers: Blueair ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20i £339 at Amazon *** Why you should trust me I’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate to wild swimming in middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and subjectively. How I tested I chose 15 fans, each from different brands, aiming for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their paces. I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest). I measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you. That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more. I also measured them myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest dimensions, including their footprint. I used a thermometer to measure the impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed away, as well as the price tag. All the fans that weren’t returned to the manufacturers were donated to Furnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic abuse. *** The best fans in 2025 *** Best fan overall: AirCraft Lume £149 at AirCraft Preorder now for delivery during week commencing 22 September This pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan. There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode. Of all I tested, this is probably the best fan for sleeping: it’s the best for low noise relative to wind speed. Pick a lower setting for silent cooling, a higher setting if you’re happy to doze off to the white noise, or use the sleep button if you’d like it to gradually reduce power in the night. I found the lower settings cooling enough to get to sleep on a hot night during a heatwave. Why we love it When I’m working from home or relaxing (I can’t say chilling out when it’s 30C+), the AirCraft Lume is the fan that I reach for. I love it for many reasons. It’s light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability: it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost plastic-free. It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) result was the best on test, and you can really feel it. During a recent heatwave, I found the powerful breeze genuinely cooling. And it’s quiet: in fact, I can’t hear it at all on levels 1-5, so I need to be careful that I remember to turn off the fan when I step away. All for a reasonable price, too. It’s a shame that … there’s nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use. Style: pedestal (or desk) Dimensions: 37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 12 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 55dB Power use on top setting: 18W Air speed on top setting: 5.9 metres a second (m/s) *** Best budget fan and best desk fan: Devola desk fan £59.95 at Devola £59.95 at AirconCentre Currently out of stock This affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad for a humble desk fan. Why we love it It’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was among the best on test. It certainly felt cooling. I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three of its nine speeds, despite being powerfully cooling, and even when the noise got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying. In fact, while the AirCraft Lume is my favourite bedside fan, the Devola perched on a bedside table does a good job on a budget. It’s powerfully cooling, inaudible on lower settings (1-3 out of 9) and on high settings, the white noise is OK to go to sleep to. Just don’t use the sleep setting: it’s noisier than it should be, so picking a medium setting worked best. Even the high settings provide a level of white noise I could go to sleep to. It’s a shame that … the display is on the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward to use. Style: desk Dimensions: 30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 9 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 50dB Power use on top setting: 16W Air speed on top setting: 4m/s *** Best misting fan: Shark FlexBreeze Pro Mist FA300UK £199.99 at Shark £249.99 at John Lewis This Shark model is much more than a pedestal fan. You can remove the pole to convert it to a desk fan. You can unplug it for cordless use. You can even add the included five-litre water tank for misting outdoors. And you can do any permutation of these things. The design is great, and the remote control stows on the back magnetically. Despite its misting feature, it’s not technically an evaporative cooler, since you can only use it with water outdoors. It sprays a fine mist of water into the air in front of the fan: you get cool, but everything gets a bit damp. Why we love it It’s incredibly versatile. Plug it in for everyday use, then carry it elsewhere (there’s a large top handle) to use as a cordless fan, or for a cooling mist on the patio while you’re entertaining outdoors. The cordless runtime is quoted as two to 24 hours, depending on fan speed, and charging time is five to six hours. Power use was impressively low: 14W on the top fan setting, 7W to charge the battery, 21W to do both at once. I compared it with the test-winning AirCraft Lume, which costs £70 less. Both are a similar size and design. The Shark has fewer fan speeds: five as opposed to the AirCraft’s 12. The design looks similar, but the head of the Shark is much deeper (33cm compared with 15cm). And it only oscillates side to side rather than up and down; you can point it at various angles, though. At 4.7m/s, the top air speed is impressive, although not quite as high as the AirCraft’s. It’s quiet enough that you can’t even hear it on the first two of its five speeds, whereas peak volume is exactly the same as the AirCraft. Is it worth £70 more? If you’ll make use of it being cordless or plan to use it outdoors, then yes. If not, stick with the AirCraft. It’s a shame that … the misting can only be used outside. Style: pedestal (or desk) Dimensions: 35 x 35 x 95cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 5 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 55dB Power use on top setting: 21W Air speed on top setting: 4.7m/s *** Best tower fan: Dreo Cruiser TF518 £99.99 at Amazon £109.99 with wifi voice control at B&amp;Q Currently out of stock This tower fan is slim but striking in black. Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan speed depending on the room temperature. Why we love it At full blast, the Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze. I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one hand. It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s powerful cooling made it forgivable. It’s a shame that … its energy consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote control. Style: tower Dimensions: 32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 9 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 60dB Power use on top setting: 29W Air speed on top setting: 3.6m/s *** Best travel fan: Morphy Richards Air Flex USB fan £39.99 at Morphy Richards Currently out of stock £37.21 at Amazon Preorder for delivery between 30 August and 3 October This is the fan you can take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk or even a power bank for more juice. Why we love it The 2.6m/s air speed can’t compete with the big fans on test – and it wasn’t the one I reached for during a heatwave – but that’s not what it’s for. It’s an electric fan that can go anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even hang it on the wall, if you wish. It’s rechargeable and you can even use it with a USB power bank to keep it running anywhere, so you can cool down in a tent or on the train. Far better than a handheld fan. I’d definitely take this fan on holiday. There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode” that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90 degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying. It’s a shame that … air speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s instead of 2.6m/s) Style: desk Dimensions: 18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 3 Remote control? No Peak noise level on test: 35dB Power use on top setting: 8W Air speed on top setting: 2.6m/s *** Best evaporative cooler: Swan Nordic air cooler £69.99 at Swan £69.99 at Amazon Currently out of stock The air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan, too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy efficient than air conditioning, so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity). Why we love it Of the two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than 30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like aircon. I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results. The breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste: some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking, too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters, so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and timer. It’s a shame that … you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo. I also found myself reaching for a fan on a hot day – it provides a light breeze, not a blast of wind. But the air that it puts out is genuinely cooler than the rest of the air in the room. Style: tower Dimensions: 29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH) Number of speeds: 24 Remote control? Yes Peak noise level on test: 45dB Power use on top setting: 26W Air speed on top setting: 0.9m/s Searching for more inspiration? Read our guide to the best evaporative air coolers *** The best of the rest *** Levoit classic tower fan £89.99 at Amazon Preorder for delivery on 3 September-10 October Best for: a quieter tower fan This produces a narrow beam of air, so you need to point it at you just right or set it to oscillate (90 degrees). It’s billed as a “20dB silent tower fan”, and it’s inaudible on the lowest four of its 12 speeds, but it was considerably louder at top whack. It’s good-looking, and I liked the space in the back to stow the remote control. There’s a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode, too. It didn’t make the final cut because … for the same price, the Dreo is more powerful, which is what you need on a really hot day. Style: tower; dimensions: 29 x 29 x 92cm (WDH); number of speeds: 12; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 50dB; power use on top setting: 40W; air speed on top setting: 1.7m/s *** Vortex Air Pro Plus £159.99 at Vortex Air Best for: style, and its all-in-one heater and fan design Vortex Air bladeless fans look modern, very Dyson-esque, and this one comes in 10 colour combos. It’s useful year-round, too, doubling as a fan heater. But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too tall for a desk fan. There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71 degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d want to point it completely down. The touch controls are at the base, which isn’t very practical if it’s on the floor, and the display was a bit hard to see. It didn’t make the final cut because … I found the noise a bit annoying; I could hear it at levels 2-10. Style: tower; dimensions: 25 x 24 x 65cm (WDH); number of speeds: 10; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 35dB; power use on top setting: 28W; air speed on top setting: 2.9m/s *** Honeywell 10-litre evaporative air cooler £109.99 at B&amp;Q Currently out of stock Best for: a quiet evaporative cooler A chunky tower fan with an extra skill: you can turn on evaporative cooling, using water to cool down the air it puts out. Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too. I liked its large (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough. I tried it several times, and in half an hour, it never managed to cool the area in front by a degree. It didn’t make the final cut because … it didn’t cool the room down enough. Style: tower; dimensions: 31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH); number of speeds: 3; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 30dB; power use on top setting: 39W; air speed on top setting: 1.8m/s *** Shark TurboBlade TF200SUK £249.99 at Electricshop £249.99 at Amazon Preorder for delivery on 8 September Best for: pointing in two directions at once This bladeless fan’s unusual T-shaped design has arms that stick out left and right, each putting out air, or you can turn them by 90 degrees for a tall, thin fan. You can angle each arm independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to the top with a strong magnet. It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con. It didn’t make the final cut because … I hated the noise it makes. Style: pedestal; dimensions: 80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode; number of speeds: 10; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 35dB; power use on top setting: 60W; air speed on top setting: 3.1m/s *** Duux Whisper Flex 2 £166.65 at Amazon Best for: smart controls This took quite a bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless. It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards, so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote very accurately at it. I did like the compostable packaging. But unusually, it drew far too much power (2W) on standby. Less than 1W is the norm. It didn’t make the final cut because … of the annoying controls. Style: pedestal; dimensions: 34 x 34 x 92cm (WDH); number of speeds: 30; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 40dB; power use on top setting: 9W; air speed on top setting: 3.1m/s *** VonHaus air circulator desk fan £69.99 at VonHaus Best for: room-filling breeze This desk fan has a display and touch controls on the front. And it oscillates well: it turns 90 degrees vertically, 80 degrees horizontally or both together to create a room-filling breeze. I couldn’t hear the lowest five of its 12 speeds, either. It looks good, and the controls are easy to use. Features include a one- to 12-hour timer and a sleep mode that decreases fan speed every 30 minutes through the night. It didn’t make the final cut because … I liked the Devola desk fan even more, but this is a solid buy too. Style: desk; dimensions: 30 x 21 x 36cm (WDH); number of speeds: 12; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 45dB; power use on top setting: 13W; air speed on top setting: 2.7m/s *** Dyson Cool CF1 £249 at John Lewis £249.99 at Debenhams Best for: looks and design You can see a lot of thought has gone into the CF1’s design. Not just its simple, circular air multiplier, but every single detail. The display is small but very readable. The oscillation (15, 40 or 70 degrees) works well. The magnetic storage on top for the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set the timer and sleep mode. I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher speeds. It didn’t make the final cut because … the price is hard to justify. Money no object? Go for it! Style: desk; dimensions: 36 x 16 x 55cm (WDH); number of speeds: 10; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 35dB; power use on top setting: 20W; air speed on top setting: 2.9m/s *** Meaco Sefte 8in portable air circulator £79.99 at Meaco £89.99 at John Lewis Currently out of stock Best for: a cordless fan This is an impressive, cordless desk fan with a battery life of four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. I couldn’t hear the first seven of its 12 speeds. It oscillates and you can manually point it up or down, and features include a timer, night and eco modes. Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two). Overall, I liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s when I unplugged it. Still, if you want a desk fan that can sometimes be cordless, it’s a good buy. It didn’t make the final cut because … the USB-powered Morphy Richards is even handier. Style: desk; dimensions: 26 x 20 x 38cm (WDH); number of speeds: 12; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 55dB; power use on top setting: 10W; air speed on top setting: 4.6m/s *** Blueair ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20i £339 at Amazon Best for: hay fever and allergy sufferers This is also a fan heater (so it’s useful all year round) and an air purifier (ideal for allergy sufferers). It cleans the air in a room in 12.5 minutes or a small house in an hour, removing airborne particles such as pollen, odours, dust and smoke. On test, it created a good breeze, even though the anemometer only read 0.8m/s. And on cooler days, it can send purified air upwards instead, circulating air in the room as well as cleaning it. The controls and display are on top, making them hard to see from across the room. But there’s an app and Alexa control as well as a remote. The three-year warranty is nice, too. It didn’t make the final cut because … it’s expensive as a fan (but great as an air purifier). Style: tower; dimensions: 24 x 24 x 50cm (WDH); number of speeds: 4; remote control? Yes; peak noise level on test: 35dB; power use on top setting: 21W; air speed on top setting: 0.8m/s *** What you need to know *** What are the different types of fan? Pedestal fans are tall fans where all the hard work happens at the top. They don’t have to be old-fashioned; some have modern designs. And some are convertible, with a pole you can remove to turn them into a desk fan. They can be good for a focused blast of cooling wind. Bladeless fans aren’t magic; they just don’t have visible blades. The work is done in the body of the fan, and then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, VortexAir and Shark on test are all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving parts on show, meaning zero chance of getting your hair caught. Tower fans are tall and narrow. They produce a lot of wind and oscillate from side to side, making them good for a room like an office. Desk fans are like pedestal fans without the pole. They’re not only for desks, they’re good on a bedside table too. And they take up less storage space over the winter. Evaporative coolers use water from a reservoir to cool the air that blows at you. They don’t produce a powerful wind like a fan, but they genuinely cool the room and are much more energy efficient than air conditioning. Note that they only cool the room a little – they won’t turn it fridge cold like aircon. What does oscillation mean? Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on their base, and some let you select how wide an angle you want. If it’s just for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide. Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres. Some also oscillate up and down, so the fan can circulate air all over the room to create a gentle breeze. What’s sleep mode? Most fans have a sleep mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night suddenly cold. Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful at bedtime. Then switch to sleep mode. Where is the best place to position a fan? For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air. Never place a fan up against a wall because air needs to flow into the back. If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to bring in the cooler air. How much does a fan cost to use? I’ll set out the maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh. The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73p per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to run it for five hours every day for a year. Running fans is pretty cheap, then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to aircon. The two I tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use about 3% of the electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1,000W). The effect isn’t the same: you can’t turn your bedroom into a fridge. But you can cool the air enough to make a big difference when there’s a heatwave. Do I need air conditioning? If you’re in the UK, honestly, no. It’s tempting to turn your bedroom into a walk-in fridge on a hot day, but fans are great and use much less electricity (and therefore money and carbon) than aircon. Unless you’re on a renewable tariff, electricity use accelerates climate breakdown. *** Caramel Quin is a journalist specialising in consumer technology.
