  On 13 March , the NWSL will commence its 14th regular season as the
  pre-eminent league in the United States. For the first time in its history, it
  will do so with 16 teams. That is double the number from the inaugural season
  in 2013 and a rapid rise from the nine teams that played out the 2020
  campaign. There is an inevitable aura of excitement surrounding the latest
  expansion as new opportunities for fans and players acceleratein an
  aspirational league. Halfway through the NWSL’s 13th regular season – which
  resumes this weekend after a prolonged summer pause – how are the expansion
  clubs, new and old, holding up? In Boston, progress seems to be moving forward
  at a faster clip than in Denver. After an initial attempt at a brand rollout
  flopped (first called BOS Nation, their ‘Too Many Balls’ ad campaign left fans
  unimpressed) the team re-emerged as a more refined Boston Legacy in March.
  Their on-field identity is starting to take shape too. Doménec Guasch left
  Barcelona to join the team as general manager, saying in telling the Guardian
  in April he was attracted by the new challenge of a singularly focused women’s
  club. At the end of June, Legacy announced the 36-year-old Portuguese Filipa
  Patão as their first coach. In July, they started signing players. Notably,
  the NWSL no longer operates a draft system. As such, Boston and Denver will be
  the first expansion sides to build their teams from scratch without an ability
  to pull players in from across the league. Instead, the NWSL has a new
  intra-league loan policy (available to all 16 teams) and stipulated up to
  $1,065,000 be made available in allocation money split 50-50 between each
  expansion franchise and the league. They will also have an additional transfer
  threshold of $968,000 more than other NWSL teams through next summer. It may
  not be enough to concoct a super team from scratch for their inaugural season
  but it is a generous amount to get them out of the gate. Legacy started their
  roster build with the 21-year-old American midfielder Annie Karich, who joined
  as a free agent from the Frauen-Bundesliga side Freiburg, but is now on loan
  with Club América Femenil in Mexico. Potentially adding to a growing selection
  of African talents making a name in the NWSL (including Kansas City’s
  record-setting Malawi striker Temwa Chawinga and Orlando Pride’s Zambia
  forward Barbra Banda), they signed the 27-year-old Malawi striker Aissata
  Traoré from the French side Fleury as their second player. She notched nine
  goals and four assists in her debut season with Fleury. Traoré also scored
  twice for Mali at the recent Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) as the
  Female Eagles reached the quarter-finals. Legacy brought their total to four
  players by signing two defenders, Americans Emerson Elgin and Laurel Ansbrow,
  both of whom are on loan in the USL Super League until the end of this year.
  Denver Summit, the league’s 16th franchise, had a much smoother brand launch,
  but remain behind in their on-field product. The branding for the Colorado
  franchise was revealed last week with a name and identity that nods toward
  lofty visions and their home. The main logo features a mountain, with a
  secondary logo that lauds the city’s elevation at 5,280 feet above sea level.
  The news dropped alongside a video billing: “Denver, a city built for the
  climb”, with a montage of Colorado mountains, cityscapes and football action.
  While they have yet to announce any signings, Denver have opted for
  intra-league experience among their staff. They brought on Jen Millet from the
  2024 expansion club Bay FC as their president and named Curt Johnson, who
  brings years of experience from the front office of North Carolina Courage, as
  their general manager. They have yet to announce a head coach. As part of
  their brand launch, Millet said the public would hear about players “soon” and
  noted the incredible breadth of native Colorado talent they may try to lure
  back to their home state. Colorado has long been a youth talent hotbed, with
  USWNT stars such as Lindsey Heaps, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson all
  hailing from the Centennial State. As for a head coach, Millet said “That’s
  also coming soon. Probably in the next few weeks.” Notably, Denver hopes to
  replicate the success of Kansas City’s purpose-built, women’s stadium with a
  home of their own. Their planned 14,500-capacity venue is on track to open for
  the 2028 season. Boston Legacy will play their inaugural season at Gillette
  Stadium, the home of the MLS side New England Revolution, but the NWSL team
  are renovating the White Stadium in Boston with hopes of playing there in
  2027. They will share White Stadium with the school district Boston Public
  Schools. In January, the NWSL commissioner, Jessica Berman, noted ambitions to
  expand beyond 16 teams. Operating in a large country where many sports leagues
  have 30 or more teams – the MLS has 30, the NFL has 32 – Berman said she sees
  “no reason” NWSL could not also expand to that number. Ambitions are high. But
  steady growth should still remain a priority for a league that is seeking to
  compete in the global marketplace of women’s football while maintaining the
  key elements of NWSL’s identity that make it attractive to play in. Ideally,
  high on that list is remaining a competitive league that is not overly
  dominated by a few super clubs,something often cited by players attracted to
  the league. Of the NWSL’s five post-2020 expansion teams, three have reached
  the playoffs, with San Diego Wave winning the 2023 NWSL Shield for best
  regular season record in their second year. But there is room for improvement
  toward the bottom of the table, where Utah Royals sit alongside the struggling
  Chicago Stars. There is time to find that footing and plenty of room for more
  expansion in the NWSL but the league would be wise to maintain its competitive
  edge as it grows. Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any
