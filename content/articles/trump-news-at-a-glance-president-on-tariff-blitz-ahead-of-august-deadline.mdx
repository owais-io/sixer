  Donald Trump’s administration has imposed sanctions against the judge
  overseeing the prosecution of his far-right ally Jair Bolsonaro and hit Brazil
  with huge tariffs amid accusations from the country’s president that Trump has
  launched “a direct attack on Brazilian democracy”. The US president has partly
  attributed his 50% tariff to his outrage at the supposed political
  “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, who is on
  trial over an alleged coup attempt after the 2022 election. Amid a blitz of
  tariff announcements, Trump also hit India with a 25% levy and an extra
  “penalty” because it buys arms and energy from Russia, while imposing a 15%
  rate on South Korea as part of a trade deal that avoids even higher levies.
  Domestically, experts say they have “enormous concerns” with a Trump
  administration initiative for millions of Americans to upload personal health
  data and medical records on new apps and systems run by private tech
  companies. Here are the key stories. Trump accused of attack on Brazil’s
  democracy over Bolsonaro judge sanctions Allies of Brazilian president Luiz
  Inácio Lula da Silva have accused Donald Trump of launching “a direct attack
  on Brazilian democracy” after the US treasury slapped sanctions on Alexandre
  de Moraes, the supreme court judge widely credited with helping save Brazilian
  democracy from a 2022 rightwing coup. The controversial US move was announced
  on Wednesday by the secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent, shortly before
  Trump followed through on a threat to hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs
  by signing an executive order “to deal with the recent policies, practices and
  actions by the government of Brazil”. Read the full story Brazilian president
  hits back as US tariffs threaten trade showdown Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has
  said he does not fear getting on the wrong side of Donald Trump as South
  America’s largest economy braces for the introduction of 50% tariffs. Trump on
  Wednesday signed an executive order confirming the US would impose the rate on
  Brazil from next week. Read the full story Divided Fed holds interest rates in
  face of Trump pressure The US Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate
  unchanged on Wednesday despite intense pressure from Trump to lower rates.
  Amid an onslaught of attacks from the White House against the Fed, officials
  at the central bank said economic “uncertainty” remained too high to lower
  rates. Read the full story US to impose 15% tariffs on South Korea as part of
  trade deal, Trump says The president has said the US will charge a 15% tariff
  on imports from South Korea as part of an agreement with the key Asian trading
  partner and ally that avoids even higher levies. The arrangement – announced
  shortly after Trump met with Korean officials at the White House – came during
  a blizzard of trade policy announcements ahead of a self-imposed 1 August
  deadline, when the president has promised higher tariffs will kick in on US
  imports from a range of countries. Read the full story Trump administration
  launching health tracking system with big tech’s help The US government is
  pushing an initiative for millions of Americans to upload personal health data
  and medical records on new apps and systems run by private tech companies,
  promising easier to access health records and wellness monitoring. “There are
  enormous ethical and legal concerns,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown
  University law professor who specialises in public health. “Patients across
  America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used
  in ways that harm them and their families.” Read the full story Ex-CIA agent
  hits out at Gabbard for going after Obama A former CIA officer who helped lead
  the intelligence assessments over alleged Russia interference in the 2016
  presidential election has said Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national
  intelligence, is ignorant of the practices of espionage after she accused
  Barack Obama and his national security team of “treasonous conspiracy” against
  Donald Trump. Read the full story Kamala Harris won’t run for California
  governor Donald Trump’s former rival for the presidency, Kamala Harris, has
  announced she is not running for California governor, as had been widely
  expected. The former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee
  announced on Wednesday that she would not run, in a decision that leaves the
  contest to lead the country’s largest blue state wide open. Read the full
  story Trump backs Israel and rebukes Starmer over Palestinian state
  recognition Donald Trump has doubled down on his backing for Israel after
  having appeared to give a green light to the British prime minister, Keir
  Starmer, to recognise a Palestinian state. Amid signs of mounting opposition
  among his Maga base to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, Trump criticized
  Starmer’s plan to grant recognition as “rewarding Hamas”, even after having
  not taken issue with it when the pair met in Scotland this week. The Canadian
  prime minister, Mark Carney, later announced his country also planned to
  formally recognise Palestine in September. Read the full story US placed on
  rights watch list under Trump A group of global civil society organisations
  has placed the US on a watchlist for urgent concern over the health of its
  civic society, alongside Turkey, Serbia, El Salvador, Indonesia and Kenya.
  Read the full story What else happened today: The US is suspending a “de
  minimis” exemption that allowed low-value commercial shipments to be shipped
  into the country without facing tariffs, the White House said. Under Trump’s
  order, parcels valued at or under $800 sent outside of the international
  postal network will face “all applicable duties”. Republicans have unveiled a
  new congressional map in Texas that would allow the party to pick up as many
  as five additional congressional seats, an aggressive manoeuvre that has
  already met decisive outcry from Democrats and comes as the GOP tries to stave
  off losses in next year’s midterm elections. Arizona congressman Greg Stanton
  says the US government violated federal law when it refused to allow him to
  visit a local restaurant owner held in an immigration detention facility last
  week. Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said the country is demanding
  the repatriation of at least 30 of its citizens currently being held in the
  controversial Florida immigration detention centre known as “Alligator
  Alcatraz”. Catching up? Here’s what happened 29 July 2025.
