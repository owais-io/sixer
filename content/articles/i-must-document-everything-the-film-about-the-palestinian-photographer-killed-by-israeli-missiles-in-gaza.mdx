  killed by Israeli missiles in Gaza

  Israel has sought to pursue its campaign of annihilation against Gaza and its
  people behind closed doors. More than 170 Palestinian journalists have been
  killed so far, and no outside reporters or cameras are allowed in. The effects
  of this policy of concealment – which the Guardian managed to pierce this week
  with a shocking aerial photograph that made the front page – are to ensure
  that the outside world only catches sight of Gaza’s horrors in small
  fragments, and to stifle empathy for those trapped inside by hiding them from
  view, obscuring their humanity. But a new documentary film, Put Your Soul on
  Your Hand and Walk, seeks to open a window to the unfathomable suffering
  inside Gaza. It focuses on the life of a single young Palestinian woman named
  Fatma Hassona, known as Fatem to those close to her. She is 24 years old when
  we meet her, and has such a broad smile and enthusiasm for life that she
  compels attention from her first appearance, a few minutes into the film. We
  see Hassona’s life through the screen of a mobile phone belonging to the
  director, Sepideh Farsi, and most of the film is made up of the conversations
  between these two women as they develop an increasingly strong personal bond
  over the course of a year. The director knows all about conflict and
  oppression. Farsi is Iranian-born and was a teenager at the time of the
  Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. When she was 16 she was imprisoned by the Islamic
  Republic regime, and she left the country for good two years later, settling
  in France. She was on tour with her film The Siren, a feature-length animation
  about the Iran-Iraq war, when the Gaza conflict erupted in October 2023. As
  the civilian death toll mounted, she found herself unable just to sit on the
  sidelines, watching endless debates that did nothing to stop the slaughter.
  “The common denominator was that there was never the Palestinian voice there,”
  Farsi says. “We had different points of views: the American, the European, the
  Egyptian, the Israeli, but never the Palestinian. It started really bothering
  me, and at some point I couldn’t live with it any more.” In spring last year
  she flew to Cairo with the idea that she could somehow find a way across the
  Gaza border to film the war firsthand. That quickly proved a naive and futile
  mission, so she began filming Gazan refugees in Egypt. One of them suggested
  to Farsi that if she wanted to talk to someone inside, he could put her in
  touch with his friend Fatma in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. We
  first see Hassona the way Farsi meets her, on her little phone screen,
  materialising with green hijab, big glasses and her broad white strip of a
  smile. They clearly delight in each other’s presence from the outset. “From
  the first call, I felt that she was someone very special, and that something
  clicked between the two of us immediately,” Farsi says. “As soon as we
  connected, I would be smiling or laughing, and she was the same on her side.”
  There had been no guarantee the two would get along. Farsi is significantly
  older, with a daughter Hassona’s age, and she is a cosmopolitan, sophisticated
  woman who has travelled the world, while Hassona has been restricted to Gaza
  all her life. Hassona is devout while Farsi is profoundly sceptical of any
  religious talk and challenges her new young friend over what kind of god would
  allow innocent people to suffer so painfully. However there is far more that
  draws them together, in ways that are harder to define. “She had this energy,
  this shining thing. She was solar,” Farsi says. “That’s the adjective that
  fits her. Her natural smile. There was this mutual fascination, sorority,
  comradeship – a mixture of all of these things – and we were happy as soon as
  we connected.” Farsi makes her phone a portal through which Hassona recounts
  her story and the tragedy of Gaza. She talks about her family and introduces
  her shy brothers to Farsi. She has already made herself a photographer and
  poet by the time they meet, and Farsi coaches her into being a film-maker and
  to send out video of the ruination around her. Hassona is supremely, naturally
  talented. Her pictures capture the everyday effort of her neighbours trying to
  survive in the rubble, while her use of language – in her poems and in
  conversation – is every bit as evocative. The film’s title is taken from her
  passing description of what it is like to venture outside: “Every second you
  go out in the street, you put your soul on your hands and walk.” In another
  conversation, struggling to make sense of what is happening, Hassona asks: “We
  live a very simple life, and they want to take this simple life from us. Why?
  I’m 24 and I don’t have any of the things that I want. Because every time you
  reach what you want, there’s a wall. They put up a wall.” The film should not
  work. It is determinedly rudimentary, filmed largely on one phone pointed at
  another. The image of Hassona sometimes freezes and buffers as the internet
  connection ebbs and flows. But these glitches draw us in and make us
  experience the precariousness of their connection. “That’s why I decided to
  keep this low resolution and not to use a regular camera,” Farsi explains. “I
  wanted it to be very low-key technically, to match the connection problems
  with her, to match the disparity of life here and there.” She had originally
  attempted a cleanly edited version with all the disconnections cut out. “It
  was lacking soul. It didn’t breathe. So we put it back in – this brokenness of
  image and sound.” The sweetness of the relationship at the core of the film is
  made bittersweet by the constant threat of death around Hassona. Every so
  often she reports the death of relatives, or neighbours whose eviscerated
  homes she points to out of her window. It feels like the encircling darkness
  is in a direct struggle with Hassona’s smile and her instinctive optimism.
  Towards the end of the film, Farsi calls Hassona to give her the happy news
  that the film has been selected to be screened at Cannes. They excitedly talk
  about Farsi obtaining a French visa that might allow Hassona to get out of
  Gaza temporarily to attend the festival. While they are talking, the young
  Palestinian sends the film-maker a photo of her passport. That was 14 April
  this year. The next day, a Tuesday, Farsi could not get through to Gaza to
  give Hassona an update on preparations. “So I said, ‘OK, we’ll do it on
  Wednesday,” the director recalls. “On Wednesday, I was working on the film on
  my computer with my phone beside me, and all of a sudden I saw a photo pop up.
  I opened the notification and saw her photo with a caption saying she had been
  killed. I didn’t believe it. I started calling her frantically, and then
  called a mutual friend, the one who introduced us, and he confirmed it was
  true.” In the middle of the night, two missiles fired by an Israeli drone had
  pierced the roof of her building and burrowed through before detonating, one
  of them exploding in the family’s second floor apartment, the other just
  below. Fatma Hassona was killed along with her three brothers and two sisters.
  Her father died later of his wounds leaving her mother, Lubna, as the sole
  survivor. The investigative group Forensic Architecture studied the missile
  strike and declared it a targeted strike aimed at Hassona for her work as a
  journalist and witness. Farsi has no doubt. “She was targeted by the IDF,” she
  says. “There were two missiles dropped by a drone on her house. It means they
  found out where she was living, planned a drone with missiles to go through
  three storeys of that building and explode on the second floor. It’s amazingly
  well planned in order to eliminate somebody who just does photography. “I
  still can’t believe it,” Farsi says, speaking from Bogotá, where she is
  touring with the film, which is now Hassona’s legacy. “It’s three months now,
  a bit more, and it’s still quite unbelievable. For me, she is somewhere out
  there and I believe I will meet her someday.” In their conversations, Hassona
  talked about all the places in the world she dreamed of seeing, while
  insisting she would always return home to Gaza. Shortly before she died, she
  told Farsi: “I have the idea that I must keep going and I must document
  everything, to be part of this story, to be me!” She imagined passing on her
  experiences to her children, but instead they have been captured for a
  cinematic audience, and Hassona’s arresting personality has been preserved at
  the same time, a portrait of a unique individual among the 60,000 dead. • Put
  Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August.
