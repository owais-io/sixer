  In Pokémon lore, the distortion world is an evil parallel universe. For
  playwright Lyuba Ilnytska, it feels like an analogy for her native Ukraine
  under Russia’s unprovoked assault. Much as she would like a giant Pokémon bird
  to stand over Kharkiv, allowing its residents a peaceful night’s sleep, the
  reality is something more bleak. There is no escape from the terror. Working
  with choreographer Anatolii Sachivko from the city’s Nafta theatre, performer
  and director Nina Khyzhna makes this theme concrete. As she presents it, the
  toll of life during wartime is not only psychological but also physical.
  Whether it is the bombardment of rockets and drones or the adjustment to
  prosthetics, air raid warnings and emergency Telegram groups, the impact hits
  the body. “Movement is a must for a human being” is a phrase repeated in a
  dance-theatre performance that articulates the unspeakable experience of
  living in sleepless fear. She dances, sometimes with small neurotic movements,
  a woman under pressure, other times with muscular fury, a victim fighting
  back, taking us through a theatrical poem that evokes the everyday oppression
  of war. Based on interviews with residents, old and young, Someone Like Me is
  a collage of voices, unrelated to each other but unified in the face of terror
  and speaking as one. A child on tiptoes plays a game of civilians and snipers;
  an old-timer recalls the great famine of the 1930s and previous military
  conflicts; a woman tries to reassure her mother they will be safe when she can
  scarcely persuade herself. Nik Akorn’s score clicks, rattles and unsettles,
  while Khyzhna moves with precision, mapping the streets of her beloved Kharkiv
  and embodying the trauma of her compatriots. It is a sad and serious creative
  response to a war that brings nothing but destruction and distress. • At
  Assembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, until 10 August • All our Edinburgh
  festival reviews
