  Rod Stewart had a few surprise guests at a recent concert in Charlotte, North
  Carolina. His old friend Ozzy Osbourne, the lead singer of Black Sabbath who
  died last month, was apparently beamed in from some kind of rock heaven, where
  he was reunited with other departed stars including Michael Jackson, Tina
  Turner and Bob Marley. The AI-generated images divided Stewart’s fans. Some
  denounced them as disrespectful and distasteful; others found the tribute
  beautiful. At about the same time, another AI controversy erupted when Jim
  Acosta, a former CNN White House correspondent, interviewed a digital
  recreation of Joaquin Oliver, who was killed at the age of 17 in a 2018 high
  school shooting in Florida. The avatar of the teenager was created by his
  parents, who said it was a blessing to hear his voice again. In June, Alexis
  Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit, posted on X an animation of his late mother
  hugging him when he was a child, created from a photograph. “Damn, I wasn’t
  ready for how this would feel. We didn’t have a camcorder, so there’s no video
  of me with my mom … This is how she hugged me. I’ve rewatched it 50 times,” he
  wrote. These are just three illustrations of a growing phenomenon of “digital
  resurrection” – creating images and bots of people who have died using
  photographs, videos, voice messages and other material. Companies offering to
  create “griefbots” or “deathbots” abound, and questions about exploitation,
  privacy and their impact on the grieving process are multiplying. “It’s vastly
  more technologically possible now because of large language models such as
  ChatGPT being easily available to the general public and very straightforward
  to use,” said Elaine Kasket, a London-based cyberpsychologist. “And these
  large language models enable the creation of something that feels really
  plausible and realistic. When someone dies, if there are enough digital
  remains – texts, emails, voice notes, images – it’s possible to create
  something that feels very recognisable.” Only a few years ago, the idea of
  “virtual immortality” was futuristic, a techno-dream beyond the reach of
  ordinary people. Now, interactive avatars can be created relatively easily and
  cheaply, and demand looks set to grow. A poll commissioned by the Christian
  thinktank Theos and carried out by YouGov in 2023 found that 14% of
  respondents agreed they would find comfort in interacting with a digital
  version of a loved one who had died. The younger the respondent, the more
  likely they were to be open to the idea of a deathbot. The desire to preserve
  connections with dead loved ones is not new. In the past, bereaved people have
  retained precious personal items that help them feel close to the person they
  have lost. People pore over photos, watch videos, replay voice messages and
  listen to music that reminds them of the person. They often dream of the dead,
  or imagine they glimpse them across a room or in the street. A few even seek
  contact via seances. “Human beings have been trying to relate to the dead ever
  since there were humans,” said Michael Cholbi, a professor of philosophy at
  the University of Edinburgh and the author of Grief: A Philosophical Guide.
  “We have created monuments and memorials, preserved locks of hair, reread
  letters. Now the question is: does AI have anything to add?” Louise
  Richardson, of York university’s philosophy department and a co-investigator
  on a four-year project on grief, said bereaved people often sought to
  “maintain a sense of connection and closeness” with a dead loved one by
  visiting their grave, talking to them or touching items that belonged to them.
  “Deathbots can serve the same purpose, but they can also be disruptive to the
  grieving process,” she said. “They can get in the way of recognising and
  accommodating what has been lost, because you can interact with a deathbot in
  an ongoing way.” For example, people often wonder what a dead loved one might
  have done or said in a specific situation. “Now it feels like you are able to
  ask them.” But deathbots may also provide “sanitised, rosy” representations of
  a person, said Cholbi. For example, someone creating a deathbot of their late
  granny may choose not to include her casual racism or other unappealing
  aspects of her personality in material fed into an AI generator. There is also
  a risk of creating a dependency in the living person, said Nathan Mladin, the
  author of AI and the Afterlife, a Theos report published last year. “Digital
  necromancy is a deceptive experience. You think you’re talking to a person
  when you’re actually talking to a machine. Bereaved people can become
  dependent on a bot, rather than accepting and healing.” The boom in digital
  clones of the dead began in the far east. In China, it can cost as little as
  20 yuan (£2.20) to create a digital avatar of a loved one, but according to
  one estimate the market was worth 12bn yuan (£1.2bn) in 2022 and was expected
  to quadruple by 2025. More advanced, interactive avatars that move and
  converse with a client can cost thousands of pounds. Fu Shou Yuan
  International Group, a major funeral operator, has said it is “possible for
  the dead to ‘come back to life’ in the virtual world”. According to the China
  Funeral Association, the cost is about 50,000 yuan per deceased person. The
  exploitation of grief for private profit is a risk, according to Cholbi,
  although he pointed to a long history of mis-selling and upselling in the
  funeral business. Kasket said another pitfall was privacy and rights to
  digital remains. “A person who’s dead has no opportunity to consent, no right
  of reply and no control.” The fraudulent use of digital material to create
  convincing avatars for financial gain was another concern, she added. Some
  people have already begun stipulating in their wills that they do not want
  their digital material to be used after their death. Interactive avatars are
  not just for the dead. Abba Voyage, a show that features digital versions of
  the four members of the Swedish pop group performing in their heyday, has been
  a runaway success, making about £1.6m each week. Audiences thrill – and sing
  along – to the exhilarating experience while the band’s members, now aged
  between 75 and 80, put their feet up at home. More soberly, the UK’s National
  Holocaust Centre and Museum launched a project in 2016 to capture the voices
  and images of Holocaust survivors to create interactive avatars capable of
  answering questions about their experiences in the Nazi death camps long into
  the future. According to Cholbi, there is an element of “AI hype” around
  deathbots. “I don’t doubt that some people are interested in this, and I think
  it could have some interesting therapeutic applications. It could be something
  that people haul out periodically – I can imagine they bring out the
  posthumous avatar of a deceased relative at Christmas dinner or on their
  birthday. “But I doubt that people will try to sustain their relationships
  with the dead through this technology for very long. At some point, I think
  most of us reconcile ourselves with the fact of death, the fact that the
  person is dead. “This isn’t to say that some people might really dive into
  this, but it does seem to be a case where maybe the prospects are not as
  promising as some of the commercial investors might hope.” For Mladin, the
  deathbot industry raises profound questions for ethicists and theologians. The
  interest in digital resurrection may be a consequence of “traditional
  religious belief fading, but those deeper longings for transcendence, for life
  after death, for the permanence of love are redirected towards technological
  solutions,” he said. “This is an expression of peak modernity, a belief that
  technology will conquer death and will give us life everlasting. It’s
  symptomatic of the kind of culture we inhabit now.” Kasket said: “There’s no
  question in my mind that some people create these kinds of phenomena and
  utilise them in ways that they find helpful. But what I’m concerned about is
  the way various services selling these kinds of things are pathologising
  grief. “If we lose the ability to cope with grief, or convince ourselves that
  we’re unable to deal with it, we are rendered truly psychologically brittle.
  It is not a pathology or a disease or a problem for technology to solve. Grief
  and loss are part of normal human experience.”
