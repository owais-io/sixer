  Jonah on Sunny What were you hoping for? Someone fun to share the sunny
  evening with. First impressions? Immediately relaxed and friendly, so easy to
  talk to that the waiter had to circle back a few times. What did you talk
  about? All the different places Sunny has lived, and her latest writing about
  techno chatrooms (I too enjoy techno). We also tried to guess which sibling
  each of us were (oldest etc). We were both wrong. Most awkward moment? When I
  told her my go-to karaoke song was Nights on Broadway by the Bee Gees, and she
  asked, “How does that go?” Good table manners? Perfect, especially when we
  both admitted we didn’t know how to do the fancy fork thing. Best thing about
  Sunny? Her openness. In the moment, I felt very comfortable talking about
  anything. Would you introduce Sunny to your friends? Yeah, for sure, they’re
  sick of me. Describe Sunny in three words Warm, curious, funny. What do you
  think Sunny made of you? Probably that I was a bit nervous and almost
  certainly a nerd. Did you go on somewhere? We went round the corner to a pub
  we realised we’d both been on dates in. And … did you kiss? Yes. If you could
  change one thing about the evening what would it be? I would have turned up
  hungrier and made a bigger dent in the desserts. Marks out of 10? 9. Would you
  meet again? For sure, but possibly just as friends. Sunny on Jonah What were
  you hoping for? Pure magic. First impressions? He was really sweet, and I
  think we matched each other’s bewilderment at the silliness of the situation.
  What did you talk about? Family, work, death-row meals, our shared
  appreciation for Ira Glass’s voice, his biking obsession that lands him in
  A&amp;E once a year. Most awkward moment? When I did a full spit-take with my
  beer on the street and he didn’t laugh. It was probably too American of me.
  Good table manners? He told me at the end he was only pretending to have good
  table manners, and he certainly fooled me. Best thing about Jonah? He was
  really easy to talk to. Would you introduce Jonah to your friends? Sure I
  would. Describe Jonah in three words Intelligent, respectful, genuine. What do
  you think Jonah made of you? I think we saw the goodness in each other. Did
  you go on somewhere? We went for one more beer down the road. And … did you
  kiss? My mom didn’t raise a prude. If you could change one thing about the
  evening what would it be? I’d have ordered another entree. Marks out of 10? 7.
  Would you meet again? If I ever have any questions about competitive off-road
  bike racing, I know who to ask. Jonah and Sunny ate at Casa do Frango, London
