  The head organiser of the LGBTQ Pride parade in London is under internal
  investigation over claims he abused his position, including by buying luxury
  perfumes with food and drink vouchers donated by a sponsor. Christopher
  Joell-Deshields, who has been chief executive of Pride in London since 2021,
  is facing a series of allegations from volunteer directors and others. They
  include misappropriation or misuse of gifts or company funds, behaviour
  damaging or potentially damaging to the company’s reputation, harassment or
  bullying of personnel and a “serious breach” of bullying, harassment and
  finance policies. Sources said that Joell-Deshields had been suspended by a
  newly constituted board of London LGBT Community Pride, the community interest
  company behind the parade. Joell-Deshields declined to comment on the
  allegations but appeared to reject the new board’s authority to suspend him.
  He said: “I remain in my role as CEO of Pride in London and as a director of
  London LGBT Community Pride CIC. “The current legal and governance matters
  relate to the organisation itself. These matters are being addressed through
  the appropriate channels, and it would be inappropriate to litigate them in
  the press. “Nothing in this statement should be interpreted as an admission of
  any allegation, nor does it comment on any other individual. For that reason,
  I will not be making any further comment at this time.” A spokesperson for the
  community interest company said: “The board of directors is aware of a number
  of allegations and is taking action to investigate these claims. “It would be
  inappropriate to comment further while these investigations are taking place,
  save to say that we take such allegations extremely seriously, and remain
  committed to upholding a safe, open and inclusive organisation that is
  compliant with its legal and governance obligations.” Pride in London is
  financed by a £625,000, five-year grant from the London mayor as well as its
  own fundraising. Concerns about governance and the conduct of the chief
  executive were raised with the board by a company director in July. This was
  followed by a formal whistleblowing disclosure by a group of volunteer
  directors at the end of last month. The new board was set up last week.
  According to a leaked copy of the whistleblowing disclosure, the volunteer
  directors complained that they had been “wholly unable to discharge our duties
  because of persistent obstruction and unacceptable actions of the CEO”. They
  also warned of a lack of accountability and transparency over spending. Among
  the allegations was the potential misuse of some of the £30,000 worth of food
  and drink vouchers provided by an unnamed sponsor for volunteers. According to
  the volunteer directors, the sponsor’s head of ethics and compliance had
  written on 18 February to the legal director at Pride in London to warn that
  the company’s fraud systems had detected that two accounts had used £7,125 of
  the vouchers on luxury items. The items included an Apple HomePod, Apple
  AirPods and cologne, including Creed Aventus, which has a retail price of at
  least £165, and Burberry Hero, which starts at £118 a bottle. According to the
  whisteblowers, the sponsor advised the legal director that “the pattern and
  nature of the transactions strongly suggested personal – rather than
  organisational – benefit”. One of the two accounts flagged was that of
  Joell-Deshields. Pride in London commissioned external lawyers to investigate,
  according to the directors’ letter, and an interim report was written.
  According to the letter, the report states that Joell-Deshields claimed the
  vouchers were used for gifts and prizes for raffles and that the HomePod was
  used in the office and at “pop up” events. The volunteer directors claimed
  that no such raffles took place last year and that they asked to see evidence
  of the unopened and unused items. They claim not to have seen the HomePod in
  the office. The external law firm is said to have recorded that
  Joell-Deshields felt the victim of a witch-hunt and had expressed “concern
  about the intentions of the people who had instigated the investigation”. The
  legal firm has provided Joell-Deshields with further time to provide
  corroborating evidence for his explanation. Further allegations against
  Joell-Deshields in the directors’ letter include overseeing a “toxic” culture
  and making inappropriate comments on WhatsApp to a disabled volunteer who he
  described as “obnoxious”. He is also said to have invited a former volunteer,
  who had been dismissed for bullying, to serve as his runner. The director of
  people intervened to prevent the appointment.
