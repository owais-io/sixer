  Ministers have vowed to give victims of sexual violence “the justice they
  deserve” as figures showed that growing numbers of sentences for such crimes
  in England and Wales were being referred back to judges as unduly lenient.
  According to internal government figures seen by the Guardian, the number of
  sentences for rape and sexual assault that were increased by the court of
  appeal after being referred by the public and the attorney general’s office
  has risen this year. Lucy Rigby, the solicitor general for England and Wales,
  said ministers were using “every possible means” to punish perpetrators who
  “need to know the book will be thrown at them”. Rigby oversees referrals to
  the unduly lenient sentence scheme, which allows anyone who is concerned about
  the length of a crown court sentence handed down for a serious crime to ask
  for it to be reviewed by the government. She reviews sentences highlighted by
  members of the public and refers those she believes appear unduly lenient to
  the court of appeal. According to government figures, 62% of the sentences
  increased by the court of appeal in the first half of this year were for rape
  and serious sexual offences. This was up from 30% in the second half of 2024
  and 41% in the first half. In 2023, the figures were 25% for the second half
  of the year and 30% in the first six months. The proportion of sentences for
  rape and serious sexual offences flagged as unduly lenient by the public and
  the attorney general’s office has also risen. In the first half of this year,
  34% of sentences flagged by the public were for such crimes, and comprised 55%
  of sentences referred by the attorney general’s office to the court of appeal.
  In 2024 and 2023 the proportion of such sentences referred by the public to
  the unduly lenient scheme ranged between 21% and 27%. Of the sentences then
  referred on to judges by the attorney general’s office, 29% were for rape and
  sexual offences in the second half of last year, compared with 33% in the
  first half. In 2023, the figures were 29% in the second half of the year and
  27% in the first half. Rigby, who is part of the 2024 intake of Labour MPs and
  was promoted to her ministerial role in December, said in an interview with
  the Guardian that ministers were “finally treating this incredibly serious
  issue as the national emergency that it is”. “It’s not just violent sexual
  offences where we see sentence increases. We’ve actually seen sentence
  increases for controlling and coercive behaviour as well, which commands a
  lower sentence than rape,” Rigby said. “The court of appeal is sending a
  message as to how it will deal with these type of offences. “It’s vital that
  we examine the causes of violence against women and girls, as well as dealing
  with the offences themselves … It goes to technology. It goes to education.
  It’s a true cross-government issue.” Asked about Reform UK’s campaign on crime
  and women’s safety, Rigby said Nigel Farage’s party was “all protest and no
  plan”. “They stoke anger. They’ve got absolutely no answers. It’s not
  leadership, it’s just empty theatrics,” she said. But she added that crime was
  something that “comes up again and again” when she spoke to her constituents
  and that the Conservative government’s handling of the criminal justice system
  had undermined public confidence and “weakened the perception of the rule of
  law”. A total of 28 criminals found guilty of violent and sexual offences
  against women and girls had their sentences increased by the court of appeal
  in the first half of this year after referrals to the unduly lenient sentence
  scheme. They included Adrian Revill, who repeatedly sexually abused a teenager
  and had his three-year sentence tripled. Gagandeep Gulati, who filmed himself
  raping a woman in Leicester city centre before sharing the video with others,
  had his sentence increased from six years to nine. In May, three men – Ibrar
  Hussain and brothers Imtiaz and Fayaz Ahmed – who raped a vulnerable teenager
  in West Yorkshire over several years in the 1990s had their sentences
  increased after a referral by Rigby. The government has promised to halve
  violence against women and girls by 2034.
