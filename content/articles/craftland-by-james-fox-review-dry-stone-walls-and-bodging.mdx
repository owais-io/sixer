  Britain, says James Fox, was once a place teeming with bodgers, badgers,
  ballers, bag women, bottom stainers, fat boys, flashers and flirters. That’s
  not forgetting the riddlers, slaggers and snobs. And before you say anything,
  these are all occupations that were once ubiquitous but are now vanishingly
  rare: a bodger makes chair legs; a badger is someone who etches glass; a fat
  boy is a greaser of axles in haulage systems, while a snob is a journeyman
  maker of boots and shoes. According to the main charity that supports
  traditional skills, 285 crafts are still practised in Britain, of which more
  than half are endangered. Seventy-two are on the critical list and it is
  these, and the people who practise them, that James Fox sets out to record. He
  meets the Nobles, who are the pre-eminent stone-walling family “in Britain, if
  not the world”. Mostly they stick close to home, in the West Yorkshire village
  where they have farmed, and walled, for centuries. Building a dry-stone wall
  requires an extraordinary kind of embodied knowledge, the sort that knows
  instinctively how to use gravity, friction and exactly the right-shaped rock
  to build a structure that allows moorland gales to whistle through and remain
  standing. Done right, a dry-stone wall will last 200 years, compared with a
  post-and-wire fence which needs replacing after 20. It would be nice to report
  that a walling renaissance is underway. Not exactly, says Fox, for the simple
  reason that it is uneconomical: even with government subsidy, a waller
  typically gets less than £85 a metre, working in conditions that only allow
  for a few metres a day. However, there is a lucrative demand from the owners
  of private landscaped gardens and tourist attractions. The Nobles recently
  flew to Japan to build a wall in Cotswold stone for a complex in Gifu. Fox
  urges us not to judge, emphasising that “crafts have always responded to the
  evolving needs of society”. This matter-of-fact attitude is shared by many of
  the people who appear in this book. Some of them downright dislike what Fox
  dubs “the C-word”. One Devonshire wheelwright explains that “craft” to him
  suggests a church fayre. “I’m not a craftsman, this isn’t a hobby, and I’m not
  keeping anything ‘alive’. This here is a trade.” Felicity Irons, a rush
  merchant and weaver who makes her living on the Great Ouse, barks furiously at
  Fox when he gauchely asks her on a cold November morning if she finds her job
  relaxing. “Of course it isn’t. It’s bloody hard work, just like any other
  job.” Even a woman whom Fox interviews in Hackney Wick making ceramic noodle
  bowls rejects the “craft” tag, telling him sternly that she is a
  “multidisciplinary artist and researcher”. Despite the caveats and the pleas
  to remain hard-headed, Craftland is a book that shimmers with love for a
  dwindling world of meticulous, patient labour. Fox becomes positively lyrical
  when describing the work of Roger W Smith, a master horologist on the Isle of
  Man who makes watches that are so special that only 20 emerge from his
  workshop each year. Sheets of gold, steel, brass and beryllium are hauled into
  the machine room at the back of the building, and months later an intricate
  piece of engineering emerges, carefully swaddled, from the front. These
  delicate assemblages of wheels, levers and jewels perform a kind of
  philosophical magic, converting the invisible forces of the universe into an
  insistent tick. You won’t get one for under £300,000. Fox works hard to
  stiffen his account of Britain’s lost crafts with statistics, places and
  dates. Despite this, there is a feeling that this genre of impressionistic
  place-writing is reaching its own expiry date. Over the past 10 years we have
  been deluged by books recovering the lost heritages of knitting, fishing,
  letter-pressing, hill farming and much more. While the illustrations in
  Craftland are lovely, it feels inevitable that they are woodcuts, linocuts and
  pen-and-ink drawings, all pictorial forms that now border on the overfamiliar.
  Craftland is both deftly written and well researched, but it feels like the
  kind of publication that is itself slipping into obsolescence. • Craftland: A
  Journey Through Britain’s Lost Arts and Vanishing Trades by James Fox is
  published by Bodley Head (£25). To support the Guardian order your copy at
