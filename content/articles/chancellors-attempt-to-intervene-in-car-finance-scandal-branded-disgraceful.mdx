  Rachel Reeves’s efforts to intervene in the supreme court case on the car
  finance scandal were “unprecedented and disgraceful” and send a “really bad
  message” to consumers that the government is willing to defend wrongdoing by
  banks, Treasury committee member and Lib Dem MP Bobby Dean has said. While the
  supreme court largely sided with finance companies on Friday – helping lenders
  avoid a £44bn compensation bill – Dean said the chancellor had gone too far to
  show she was on the side of business. That included a controversial attempt to
  intervene in the supreme court hearing in January, in which she urged judges
  to avoid handing “windfall” compensation to borrowers. That attempt was
  ultimately rejected. “I thought it was pretty unprecedented and pretty
  disgraceful,” said Dean, who sits on an influential parliamentary committee
  that scrutinises City firms, regulators and the Treasury. The chancellor had
  also been considering overruling the supreme court’s decision with
  retrospective legislation to help save lenders billions of pounds, in the
  event that it upheld the entirety of October’s court of appeal ruling, the
  Guardian revealed last week. “What message does it send to consumers that the
  industry can do wrong, the courts can support the claim that they’ve done
  something wrong, but the government is ready to intervene and defend the
  industry that’s done wrong, instead of defending the consumer? I think that’s
  a really bad message to put out,” Dean said. “I feel like this government
  sometimes is too keen to demonstrate it is on the side of business, and is
  sometimes not understanding the rights of consumer,” he added. Reeves’s
  intervention efforts followed intensive lobbying by the car loan industry,
  which feared the supreme court would uphold last October’s shock ruling by the
  appeal court. That October ruling suggested commission payments paid by
  lenders to car dealers were unlawful, unless explicitly disclosed to
  borrowers. It could have opened the door to billions of pounds of compensation
  claims against companies including Lloyds Banking Group, Santander UK,
  Barclays and Close Brothers, and result in a redress scheme that rivalled the
  £50bn payment protection insurance saga. Lobby group the Financing and Leasing
  Association (FLA) – which represents car lenders – had warned the government
  that a big compensation bill could push some lenders into failure, while
  others would offer fewer or more expensive loans to claw back their losses.
  That could restrict options for people who relied on credit. City bosses were
  also warning the Treasury that the continuing uncertainty over the scandal was
  deterring international investment in the finance industry, and was therefore
  putting the UK’s economic growth at risk The FLA’s head of motor finance,
  Adrian Dally, said that the lobby group was pleased with the supreme court’s
  ruling, and felt its concerns had been heard by Treasury and regulators. He
  confirmed the FLA had been speaking with the Treasury nearly every week since
  the court of appeal ruling in October, including about its concerns on the car
  finance case. However, he rejected suggestions the Treasury had prioritised
  the industry over consumers. “We absolutely disagree with that because,
  ultimately, this [car finance] industry is a vital part of the nation’s
  infrastructure, and enables millions of people to get to work, to get to
  school, and that was put at risk by these court cases. And ultimately, we
  believe the industry’s interests and the consumers’ interests are aligned on
  this.” But Dean said government interventions set a “really bad precedent if
  you’re going to intervene on cases of consumer redress on the basis that it
  might damage industry, because then almost every consumer redress case would
  fall”, Dean said. Dean added that compensation schemes can give consumers
  confidence to borrow and invest, knowing they will be protected when companies
  take advantage of customers. “Obviously, the best industry is one where these
  redress systems are not needed in the first place, because people play by the
  rules.” The Financial Conduct Authority is due to confirm whether or not it
  will press ahead with a compensation scheme before the stock markets open on
  Monday morning. A Treasury spokesperson said: “It is vital that consumers have
  access to motor finance to enable them to spread the cost of a vehicle in a
  way that is manageable and affordable. “We respect this judgment from the
  supreme court, and we are working with regulators and industry to understand
  the impact for both firms and consumers. “We recognise the issues this court
  case has highlighted, and we are already taking forward significant changes to
  the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Consumer Credit Act.”
