  Teenage star jockey Billy Loughnane: ‘It’s been my dream job since I was a
  baby’

  “I want to be champion jockey,” Billy Loughnane says, with the grin that is
  already something of a trademark. “That’s my goal, my only ambition. I want to
  be champion jockey, I need to be champion jockey and hopefully I’ll be able to
  do it.” From any other teenage rider bar the 19-year-old Loughnane, such a
  resolute statement of intent could prompt at least a niggle of concern that,
  with such a tight focus on the ultimate destination, he might not appreciate
  the journey. Loughnane, though, has been a little different from the earliest
  days of his riding career. He was being talked about as a future champion well
  before he started to discuss the idea himself. He has also, quite clearly,
  been enjoying every moment of the ride and every fresh career milestone that
  has appeared in his rearview mirror at a remarkably early stage of his career.
  Horses have always just run for Loughnane, as they did for Ryan Moore, Frankie
  Dettori and, way back in the 1950s, for a teenaged Lester Piggott who, like
  Loughnane, grew up in a racing yard and started out riding for his father.
  “There’s pictures of me a couple of days after I was born, perched up on a
  horse,” Loughnane says. “I grew up around racehorses and it’s been my dream
  job since I was a baby, as soon as I could imagine. “I’ve had a good couple of
  years and I’ve been lucky since I started. I’ve got a very good agent behind
  me now in Tony Hind, and a good boss in George Boughey to go with it.” Dettori
  was the champion apprentice at 18 but Loughnane was a year younger when he
  picked up the prize in 2023 and, while Dettori needed the best part of two
  full seasons to ride out his claim, Loughnane reached the necessary 95 winners
  less than a year after his debut success in November 2022. It was an 11-month
  period when the naturally gifted Loughnane was, for practical and punting
  purposes, a senior jockey with a claim. His first winner – Swiss Rowe for his
  father, Mark – was a 28-1 chance but it did not take the market long to catch
  up. Within weeks, he was the punters’ favourite apprentice, riding – and
  winning – on well-backed runners on almost a daily basis. His first Group-race
  win arrived in April 2024 and a first success at Royal Ascot – on only his
  ninth ride at Flat racing’s showpiece meeting – came two months later, as
  Loughnane coolly steered Rashabar, an unconsidered 80-1 shot in the betting,
  to victory in the Group Two Coventry Stakes. It was the jockey’s sole ride on
  Brian Meehan’s colt and it remains the only success of Rashabar’s 10-race
  career. A longed-for first success at Group One level, meanwhile, arrived this
  month, when he got the call from Charlie Appleby to ride Rebel’s Romance, the
  hot favourite, in the Grosser Preis von Berlin. Amid all the quickfire success
  and the inevitable attention that followed, Loughnane’s awareness and
  composure in the saddle have been matched by a strikingly clear-eyed sense of
  how far he still has to travel. How has he managed to stay so grounded?
  “Everyone asks me the question,” he says, “and it’s a difficult one for me to
  answer. “I wake up, ride out in the mornings, try and ride out in as many
  places as possible to get around and get the rides later in the day. Then I go
  to the gym, go to the races, focus on my rides, ride my horses and go home,
  that’s my whole life.” In 2025, Loughnane has not simply been busy, but the
  busiest rider of all in the British weighing room, with 771 rides. Rossa Ryan,
  with 712 rides, is the only other jockey to pass 700. Every ride, meanwhile,
  involves much more than a minute or two on the track. “A lot goes in
  beforehand with the form book,” he says, “looking at my horse’s previous form
  and its run style, making a plan on what to do with the trainer before the
  race. I’m very lucky that I’ve got a good team around me and a driver to drive
  me to the races, so I can do my form in the car on the way, when I’m not
  sleeping.” Only Oisin Murphy, with 131 winners since 1 January, has ridden
  more than Loughnane’s 124 this year, and though Loughnane trails the reigning
  champion by 28 in the official race, which runs from May to mid-October, a
  recent burst of winners has taken him into a clear second, going into the Ebor
  meeting at York this week. “There are no days off, I’m riding seven days a
  week,” he says, “but I’m happy to be busy and I’d be complaining if I was sat
  at home with no rides. My outlook’s the same and it will always be the same –
  trying to win the championship every year to come.” Danon Decile can deliver
  York delight Only six go to post for the Group One International Stakes at
  York on Wednesday but the race still promises to be one of the highlights of
  the summer season, with horses from four different countries ensuring that it
  lives up to its name. Delacroix and Ombudsman, first and second respectively
  in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown last month, head the betting, with Ombudsman
  narrowly favoured at 15-8 and Delacroix back to around 2-1 after a concerning
  – and unexplained – drift to 6-1 over the weekend. The pair are closely
  matched on their Sandown form but nowhere near as far clear of their field on
  ratings as the market suggests. See The Fire, whose sire (Sea The Stars) and
  dam (Arabian Queen) both won this race, is an intriguing alternative at the
  track and trip where she took the Middleton Stakes by a dozen lengths in May,
  and it is easy to overlook her run behind Whirl at Goodwood last time after
  she handed several lengths to the winner at the start. A stronger challenge,
  though, may emerge from the Japanese-trained contender Danon Decile (3.35).
  Keita Tosaki’s four-year‑old won last year’s Japanese Derby, and showed he can
  take his best form overseas when coming home a length and a half in front of
  Calandagan, the King George winner at Ascot last month, in March’s Sheema
  Classic at Meydan. York 1.50: Spring Is Sprung is in the form of his life and
  has already landed a £100,000 bonus for three wins in the Sunday Series. Paul
  Midgley’s six-year-old has just a 5lb penalty for his most recent success and
  has a useful draw in stall one as he looks to complete a four-timer. York
  2.25: The eye-catcher at the prices in a competitive Acomb Stakes is David
  Menuisier’s Goodwood Galaxy at around 8-1 He was still showing plenty of signs
  of inexperience when finishing a two-length fourth behind Zavateri in the
  Vintage Stakes at Glorious Goodwood last month but made rapid progress when
  the penny dropped in the closing stages and the time of the race suggests it
  is strong form.. York 3.00: It is a bold move by Aidan O’Brien to send
  Lambourn, the Derby winner at Epsom and in Ireland, into action under a
  penalty in the Great Voltigeur, and while Ryan Moore’s mount is an inevitable
  favourite he was a workmanlike winner at the Curragh and the extra 5lb on his
  back brings several rivals within striking distance on Timeform’s ratings.
  Pride Of Arras, a bitter disappointment since his impressive win at this track
  in the Dante in May, returns to the Knavesmire as a gelding and would be a big
  runner on his spring form, but the unbeaten Carmers may be a safer bet to
  continue his progress after another career-best in the Queen’s Vase last time.
  York 4.10: The return to two miles could well see a return to winning form by
  Dancing In Paris, whose best run this year came at this trip in the
  Northumberland Plate in June.
