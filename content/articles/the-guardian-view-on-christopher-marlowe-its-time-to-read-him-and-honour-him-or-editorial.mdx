  For a limited season this autumn, Christopher Marlowe will become a star of
  the London stage again. Enjoy it while you can, for Marlowe has become an
  ephemeral figure in Britain’s national culture. His plays, once staples, are
  now produced only intermittently, if at all. Today, Marlowe is probably better
  known for his dramatic death, stabbed in a London riverside tavern, than for
  anything he wrote or for being the literary pioneer that he was. From next
  week, however, the sexy and brilliant figure of Kit Marlowe will be the
  centrepiece character, played by Ncuti Gatwa, in Liz Duffy Adams’s two-hander,
  Born With Teeth, which is currently in previews in the West End, with its
  offical opening next week. The play teases with the possibility, first
  reported in this newspaper in 2016, that Marlowe and William Shakespeare,
  played by Edward Bluemel, collaborated on writing parts of the Henry VI
  trilogy. But not just that. Perhaps the two playwrights, both born in 1564,
  were lovers. And perhaps Shakespeare even had a hand in Marlowe’s murder in
  1593. Ms Adams is not the first writer to put Marlowe and Shakespeare on the
  stage together. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard did the same in their Shakespeare
  in Love screenplay, adapted for the theatre by Lee Hall. Here too, Marlowe is
  the more charismatic figure, while Shakespeare struggles in his shadow. It is
  Marlowe who suggests that Shakespeare, searching for an analogy to start his
  new love sonnet, should compare his love not to an autumn morning but to a
  summer’s day, and Marlowe, too, who suggests that Juliet would be a better
  name for Romeo’s beloved than Shakespeare’s proposed Ethel. As moments like
  these suggest, there’s always a clever trick in any play in which Shakespeare
  himself appears. We the audience know what those on stage never can. We know
  that Shakespeare will conquer the world for centuries to come. His fellow
  characters can only see just another jobbing but talented playwright, whose
  star is obviously eclipsed by that of the dazzling Marlowe. Yet how strongly
  does Marlowe’s light shine today? England’s second most famous Elizabethan
  playwright is still a name. His plays, though, are no longer shared points of
  reference in the way that Shakespeare’s, thank goodness, still are. The Royal
  Shakespeare Company still does Marlowe fairly regularly, most recently Edward
  II earlier this year. So does the Malthouse at Marlowe’s old school in
  Canterbury, where the city’s theatre is also named after the playwright. But
  the National Theatre, disgracefully, seems to have given up. In 1976, amid
  fanfares, the Olivier Theatre opened its doors on London’s South Bank with
  Marlowe’s Tamburlaine. It has never put the play on since. It is now 12 years
  since the National has done anything by Marlowe at all. Two things could and
  should be done to restore Marlowe to his rightful place. The first, obviously
  and simply, is to study and produce his plays more. Schools and exam boards
  have crucial roles here, but the subsidised theatre should lead the way. The
  second is to commemorate Marlowe properly. The playwright’s violent death in
  Deptford Strand, on the south bank of the Thames, is the stuff of conspiracy
  theories and speculation. Yet walk along Deptford Strand and you will find no
  monument there to this baleful event. A wall plaque in St Nicholas’s church
  graveyard notes that Marlowe’s remains were buried nearby. But the site is
  littered with empty beer bottles. We surely owe Marlowe greater honour than
  this. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you
