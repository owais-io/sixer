  Guéhi?

  With less than a month remaining in the summer transfer window, deals that
  have been bubbling away for weeks will suddenly hit a boiling point as clubs,
  players and agents scramble to finalise moves. Newcastle, for one, are getting
  impatient. They are reportedly expecting a high-stakes bidding war for RB
  Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, upping their offer to an eye-watering £69.7m plus
  add-ons, which is closer to matching Leipzig’s valuation of the Slovene.
  Manchester United are lurking in the shadows with sources suggesting they do
  not need to sell anyone to make a move despite their intentions to offload
  Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Eddie Howe’s side
  will be desperate to secure the striker’s signature despite Alexander Isak
  being expected to return to training, with the Swede’s head everywhere but
  Tyneside. Newcastle are also reportedly going back for Crystal Palace defender
  Marc Guéhi, a player Howe has been keen on for a while. With just one year
  left on his contract and a clear refusal to sign a new deal, Palace are
  holding out for £50m, but Newcastle are only willing to go up to £40m.
  Something has to give. Guéhi, an attractive prospect given his ability to play
  on the left and right in central defence, also has interest from Liverpool but
  the Merseyside club are also waiting for the defender’s fee to drop. Down in
  London, Chelsea are reportedly open to offers for Nicolas Jackson. The club
  are not in any rush to sell the 24-year-old but feel, with the arrivals of
  Liam Delap and João Pedro, Jackson’s spot as the main forward is no longer
  guaranteed. He could prove to be an attractive option for clubs who fail to
  sign their first-choice centre-forward. Across the continent, Real Madrid’s
  Rodrygo has decided to stay and fight for his place, despite strong interest
  from Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham. Earlier in the window it was reported
  the player was desperate to leave but the Brazilian is comfortable in the
  Spanish capital. With Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior as his main
  competition, it is a bold move, but it shows his confidence. Youngsters
  Endrick and Gonzalo García, who Madrid only want to keep one of, will also be
  pushing for places too. Add Atalanta to the list of clubs working away to find
  a new striker. Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz is now their top target. The Italian
  club have also held talks about Palace’s Jean-Philippe Mateta, but a reported
  £34.7m bid was recently rejected, suggesting they will have to up the ante.
  The club need to sign a forward with the future of Ademola Lookman hanging in
  the balance. The forward is on strike after not showing up to Atalanta’s
  pre-season training due to his unhappiness at the club refusing to sanction a
  move to Inter despite an offer of €45m (£39m) including bonuses. The player
  addressed his grievances publicly on social media but the club are steadfast
  in refusing to sell him to any Serie A rival. The 27-year-old is under
  contract until June 2027. The Napoli midfielder Jens Cajuste is leaning
  towards a return to Ipswich instead of a more lucrative offer from Neom SC, a
  Saudi Pro League team. The 26-year-old spent last season on loan at Portman
  Road and, despite a huge salary dangling in front of him, it seems the pull of
  familiar surroundings is more appealing. A final decision on a potential €8m
  move is expected soon. Neom are reportedly offering €2.5m for a loan deal,
  with a further €8m option to buy. Besiktas, Crystal Palace and Burnley have
  also enquired about the player. It is unlikely Cajuste would stay in Naples,
  struggling to find form at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.
