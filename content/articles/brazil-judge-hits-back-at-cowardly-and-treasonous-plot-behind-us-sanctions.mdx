  The supreme court judge presiding over the trial of Brazil’s ex-president,
  Jair Bolsonaro, has said a “cowardly and treacherous” plot is afoot to pave
  the way for another attack on the South American country’s democracy. Judge
  Alexandre de Moraes was put under sanctions by the US on Wednesday, as part of
  an apparent push by Donald Trump to help his ally Bolsonaro escape punishment
  for allegedly masterminding an attempted coup after losing the 2022 election
  to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Trump also slapped a 50% tariff on Brazilian
  imports in response to what he called the “witch-hunt” against the far-right
  former president. On Friday, Moraes, a shaven-headed Muay Thai practitioner
  known by the nickname Xandão (‘Big Al’), came out swinging. He told the court
  that Trump’s tariffs and the “spurious” sanctions targeting him and other
  supreme court justices recently stripped of their US visas, were part of an
  “illegal and immoral” ruse to obstruct justice that was being engineered by a
  group of Brazilian “traitors” who had lobbied foreign authorities to carry out
  “hostile acts” against the country’s economy. Moraes said the campaign’s
  objectives were identical to those of the 8 January 2023 riots in the capital,
  Brasília, when hardcore Bolsonaro supporters stormed the supreme court,
  congress and presidential palace in an attempt to reverse his election defeat.
  Those rioters, Moraes said, had hoped to generate social chaos that would
  provoke a military intervention and make way for a coup. Two and a half years
  later, Moraes claimed that by lobbying foreign authorities to impose tariffs,
  the Brazilians behind the alleged plot were trying to trigger “an economic
  crisis, that would create a social and then a political crisis so that, once
  again, there might be social instability and the chance of a new putschist
  attack”. “To the disappointment of these Brazilian traitors, [that] will not
  occur,” the judge added. Moraes did not name the “supposedly patriotic
  Brazilians” he claimed were leading the supposed plot from overseas. But his
  comments were an unmistakable reference to Bolsonaro’s third son, the
  congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, who moved to the US in February and has
  admitted to lobbying Trump officials to pressure Brazil over his father’s
  plight. After Trump hit Moraes with sanctions this week, the younger Bolsonaro
  thanked him and said: “I have a feeling of mission accomplished”. The supreme
  court’s coup trial is expected to conclude in the coming weeks and Bolsonaro –
  who has denied leading a power grab – is expected to be convicted and
  sentenced to up to 43 years, meaning the 70-year-old could spend the rest of
  his life in jail. Moraes vowed that the court’s work would continue as normal,
  despite the “ham-fisted” attempts at coercion. There would be no “cowardly
  surrender” from its members as they sought to defend their country’s
  democracy. Trump’s attempt to pressure Brazil’s government and judiciary over
  Bolsonaro’s fate has sparked the most severe diplomatic crisis between Brazil
  and the US in decades. “The US government’s interference in the Brazilian
  justice system is unacceptable,” Lula said on Wednesday, after Trump signed
  his tariffs into force and hit Moraes with Magnitsky sanctions normally
  reserved for the perpetrators of severe human rights violations. Polls suggest
  most Brazilians oppose Trump’s attempts to meddle in the functioning of their
  country’s institutions. Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political
  scientist and Latin America expert, believed Trump was trying to punish the
  government of a country which had “done a better job than the US by quite some
  distance at holding an authoritarian leader accountable”. “Right now, Brazil
  is more democratic than the United States,” Levitsky said. “Brazil’s democracy
  is flawed. It’s got problems. It’s polarized. But it’s a real functioning
  democracy and of course many Brazilians are pissed off that the Trump
  administration is trying to use trade policy to undermine the legal process
  there.”
