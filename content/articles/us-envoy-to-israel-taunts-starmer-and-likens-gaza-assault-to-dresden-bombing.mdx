  The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has launched an undiplomatic
  attack on Keir Starmer by invoking the allied second world war bombing of
  Dresden after the British prime minister criticised the Israeli security
  cabinet’s decision to expand the war in Gaza. “So Israel is expected to
  surrender to Hamas &amp; feed them even though Israeli hostages are being
  starved?” Huckabee wrote on social media in response to a post by Starmer
  calling for an immediate ceasefire and lamenting the humanitarian crisis in
  Gaza, as well as the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages being held by
  Hamas. Provocatively, Huckabee added: “Did UK surrender to Nazis and drop food
  to them? “Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer? That wasn’t food you dropped. If
  you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!” The bombing of Dresden by
  the RAF and US air force in February 1945 is estimated to have killed tens of
  thousands of civilians. It remains one of the most controversial allied acts
  of the second world war, amid questions marks over its strategic necessity and
  the widespread destruction in civilian areas. Huckabee, who became the first
  evangelical Christian to be Washington’s envoy to Israel after Donald Trump
  nominated him following last November’s presidential election, did not leave
  it at that. In a follow-up post, he wrote: “How much food has Starmer and the
  UK sent to Gaza?” He claimed Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, had
  sent 2m tons of food to Gaza, “none of it even getting to hostages”, making an
  apparent reference to unsupported claims that Hamas is intercepting deliveries
  and hoarding aid. “Maybe UK PM ought to sit this one out &amp; follow Arab
  League who said Hamas should disarm &amp; release ALL hostages immediately.”
  The ambassador’s blunt comments went well beyond the public remarks of Trump
  when he met Starmer at Turnberry in Scotland last month. The US president
  declined to criticise Starmer in his presence after it emerged that Britain
  was preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood in the absence of a ceasefire
  in Gaza. Huckabee, a former Republican presidential candidate, has a history
  of making intemperate comments in Israel’s favour. In 2008, he said, “There’s
  really no such thing as a Palestinian.” He has also declined to use the term
  “West Bank”, claimed by Palestinians a territory for part of a future state –
  instead referring to the territory by the biblical name of Judea and Samaria,
  which is used by Israel. He has also declined to call Israeli settlements in
  the territory by that name, insisting on calling them “communities”. In June,
  he told the BBC that Muslim countries should provide the land for a
  Palestinian state. “At what point does it have to be in the same piece of real
  estate that Israel occupies?” he said. “Muslim countries have 644 times the
  amount of land that are controlled by Israel. So maybe if there is such a
  desire for the Palestinian state, there would be someone who would say we'd
  like to host it.”
