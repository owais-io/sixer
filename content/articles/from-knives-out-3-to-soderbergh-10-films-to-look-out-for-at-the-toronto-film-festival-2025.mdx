  It was a mostly underwhelming edition of the Toronto film festival last year,
  aiming for a big comeback after the strikes affected the year prior.
  Disappointments such as Nightbitch, Eden, The Last Showgirl, Nutcrackers, The
  Return and The Cut were only mildly offset by the surprising appearance of
  Mike Leigh with his effectively gruelling drama Hard Truths. But after
  spottier Venice and Telluride festivals than usual, worryingly light on
  slam-dunks, all eyes return to this year’s Toronto, hopeful that it might
  correct course for the season. The Lost Bus With Venice and Telluride snapping
  up most of the bigger hitters, Toronto has felt a little light on Oscar
  contenders in recent years (since 2017, only six Toronto world premieres have
  been nominated for best picture compared with 15 from Venice). But if bets
  were to be placed based on an initial glance at this year’s crop, The Lost Bus
  would seem like the safest pick. It’s the new film from Paul Greengrass,
  returning to the anxious immediacy of his fact-based retellings, having
  previously taken us back to the horror of September 11 (United 93), the Maersk
  Alabama hijacking (Captain Phillips) and the 2011 Norway terrorist attacks (22
  July). In The Lost Bus, he’s working with producer and recent Oscar winner
  Jamie Lee Curtis to tell the harrowing story of the 2018 Camp fire, the
  deadliest in California’s history. Another Oscar winner, Matthew McConaughey,
  stars as a bus driver trying to save some schoolchildren and their teacher,
  played by Oscar nominee America Ferrera. Given the ongoing wildfires that have
  affected California, including many of those within the entertainment
  industry, it sounds like a nail-biter that will also strike an emotional chord
  for many. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery It wasn’t as if Rian
  Johnson’s Knives Out came without fanfare (this was, after all, the director
  of 2012’s superb sci-fi thriller Looper), but no one expected it to create
  quite such a stir at 2019’s Toronto film festival. It was the kind of
  crowd-pleasing premiere film-makers dream about (the audience was as locked in
  and audibly enthused as I’ve ever heard at a festival) and restarted the
  whodunnit genre as we now know it. The Netflixication of the series (in
  pandemic times, the streamer paid $450m for two sequels) led to Glass Onion,
  which also premiered to Toronto in 2022. It was fun but notably inferior and
  now, with another three-year gap, the knives are out once again. Daniel Craig
  is of course returning, and this time his suspects include Josh O’Connor,
  Glenn Close, Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Josh Brolin, Cailee Spaeny and
  Jeremy Renner, whose fictional hot sauce made a cameo in the last film. Little
  is known, as one would expect, but this time there’s a religious component and
  the mystery appears to unfold in England. Christy This Toronto promises a
  transformative role for Sydney Sweeney, a young actor who might be in need of
  some transformative PR after a rough few months. She became instant thinkpiece
  fodder when she appeared in a dubious American Eagle campaign about “good
  jeans” before her two summer indies died at the box office. She’s surely
  praying that Christy, an old-fashioned awards play, will redirect the
  narrative as she takes on the role of groundbreaking boxer Christy Martin. The
  film tells of her rise to fame in the 1980s as well as her destructive
  marriage to a man who tries to kill her. It’s the latest from Australian
  director David Michôd, who broke out with electrifying crime drama Animal
  Kingdom but has struggled to make an impact since, with starry films such as
  War Machine and The King failing to land. Both Sweeney and Michôd (as well as
  those aiming to sell the film at the festival) will be hoping this one is a
  real contender. Good Fortune Aziz Ansari’s rise from standup to Parks and
  Recreation supporting player to Master of None creator took a pause after he
  was the focus of a questionable #MeToo exposé and then another when a film he
  was directing was shut down after star Bill Murray was accused of sexual
  misconduct. Bad luck followed as the Hollywood strikes delayed the start date
  of a film he was scheduled to write, direct and star in. But once the industry
  restarted, he finally got to the finish line with Good Fortune, a film he
  hopes will help revive the theatrical comedy experience. It’s a throwback to
  the kind of high-concept genre hybrid that would regularly hit big in the
  1980s, focusing on a guardian angel who makes two men swap lives, one rich and
  one poor. The angel is played by Keanu Reeves (this will be his first
  non-franchise movie since 2019) with Seth Rogen, Keke Palmer and Sandra Oh
  also starring. This one has scored a plum Saturday night premiere (a slot
  previously given to The Fabelmans) so expectations are high. The Fence It’s
  unusual for a lot of esteemed European directors to premiere their films at
  Toronto, often preferring a Cannes or Venice debut, but Claire Denis bucked
  the trend back in 2018 with the gonzo, Robert Pattinson-led High Life, her
  first English-language movie. It was warmly received, and with her last film,
  romantic thriller Stars at Noon, opening to a cooler reception at Cannes,
  she’s now heading back to Toronto with her follow-up, The Fence. It’s a tense
  drama about a British-owned construction site in Africa and the fallout from
  an accident that kills a local worker. Matt Dillon, who is on a bit of an
  auteur run after working with Wes Anderson and Lars von Trier, stars with How
  to Have Sex breakout Mia McKenna-Bruce and Tom Blyth. Roofman Toronto is by
  far the most commercial-leaning of the upper-tier festivals and aside from the
  Oscar contenders, it’s been host to a long line of broad crowd-pleasers. Films
  such as Hustlers, Knives Out, Heretic, Halloween and Widows were all met with
  enthusiasm from both critics and general audiences and kicked off press cycles
  with added word-of-mouth buzz. This year, it feels like Roofman might do the
  same; it’s a film that looks like the kind of sturdy star-led comedy drama
  that would have been released back in the 2000s. It’s fitting that it’s also
  led by two stars of that era – Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst – heading up
  the true story of a runaway robber hiding in a Toys R Us who falls for one of
  the employees. It’s directed by Derek Cianfrance, who broke out with
  devastating divorce drama Blue Valentine but hasn’t really found his footing
  since (with messy crime drama The Place Beyond the Pines and creaky melodrama
  The Light Between Oceans). Here’s hoping this one lands. The Christophers It’s
  never easy to predict what Steven Soderbergh will do next; he’s a chameleonic
  director whose repeated threats of retirement have thankfully proved empty. In
  the last few years, he’s given us a paranoid tech thriller, an unconventional
  haunted house story, a sexy London-set spy caper, a 50s-set crime drama and a
  semi-improvised Meryl Streep comedy, all either excellent or at the very least
  interesting. It tracks then that his next would be another left turn, this
  time all the way back to England with twisty black comedy The Christophers.
  He’s assembled a crackerjack cast – Ian McKellen, Michaela Coel and Baby
  Reindeer breakout Jessica Gunning – for a film about an artist who has to
  secretly complete the unfinished work of an ageing great for his greedy
  estranged children. It’s a rare lead role for Coel since her thrilling TV
  triumph I May Destroy You and the prospect of her paired with McKellen is
  something to get excited about. The Choral Last year, Ralph Fiennes charmed
  his way through awards season with his Conclave campaigning, alternating
  between serious and silly, rather like the film he was nominated for. There’s
  a chance he could be in the running again, leading another potential
  crowd-pleaser about a group of men trying to navigate difficult circumstances.
  In The Choral, he plays a choir director trying to assemble singers in 1916
  Yorkshire as the first world war rages on. It’s a reunion for director
  Nicholas Hytner and writer Alan Bennett, who came together for 2015’s middling
  Maggie Smith drama The Lady in the Van, but their work elsewhere still
  provides hope that this one could sing. It could be the kind of rousing,
  heartstring-yanking period piece that easily wins a classic Toronto afternoon
  audience over. EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert Baz Luhrmann’s longtime passion
  for Elvis Presley has already brought us a maximalist biopic that focused on a
  more creatively and commercially prohibitive period for the singer. Elvis
  (2022) was a divisive big swing for critics but a hit with both audiences and
  the academy, and during production, Luhrmann announced a second Presley
  project. Three years later and he’s bringing EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert to
  Toronto, his first world premiere at the festival (he’s tended to prefer
  Cannes for previous films). It’s the result of recently discovered archival
  footage, showing Presley during his Vegas residency in the 1970s. Unlike
  Elvis, this promises to show the singer unbound by limitations, the film
  flipping between excitable rehearsal footage, his electric performances and
  the thrilled celebrity audience. Couture After her big Marvel outing Eternals
  was a big flop and her much-buzzed Oscar play Maria was a bit of a buzzkill,
  Angelina Jolie is refusing to let any bad press slow down her comeback to
  acting. The Oscar winner is currently filming comedy Anxious People with Aimee
  Lou Wood and Jason Segel and will be attracting one of the biggest crowds this
  week when she premieres her new film Couture, a Paris-based drama. She’ll be
  playing a fashion-hating US film director, landing for fashion week, who finds
  her life intersecting with other international women involved with a show.
  It’s the latest film from Alice Winocour, who last came to Toronto with her
  sensitively drawn drama Paris Memories about a woman processing her experience
  of a terrorist attack. It’s become unusual to see Jolie play an everyday
  person without horns, superpowers or celebrity, so Couture could maybe act as
  the real start to her A-list return.
