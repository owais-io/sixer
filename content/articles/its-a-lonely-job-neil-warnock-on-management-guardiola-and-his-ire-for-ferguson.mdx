  ‘I was at Crystal Palace and I wanted a centre-half,” Neil Warnock says as,
  after 45 years as a manager, he describes how football has changed since his
  rise from non-league to the Premier League. “I sent Ronnie Jepson, my
  assistant, to Scotland to watch a centre-half. And he came back and said he
  would cost us around £4m, but he was very good. So I told the people at
  Crystal Palace.” Warnock resists identifying Steve Parish, Palace’s chairman,
  by name for he is deep in a story that illustrates how data analytics is not
  always infallible. “He asked for 24 hours and went to the data people. The
  next day he said: ‘We don’t want to go ahead.’ I asked him why and he said
  they don’t think he’s quick enough. I said: ‘He might not look quick enough,
  but he’s in second gear in Scotland. If he had to sprint, he’d sprint.’” I
  already know Warnock is remembering how he missed signing Virgil van Dijk and,
  as we’re having an enjoyable knockabout, I ask if even a great player such as
  Franz Beckenbauer might have been dismissed by the stats men. The German
  sweeper had pace and tenacity, but his regal vision meant he could intercept a
  pass without needing to produce a crunching tackle. “Correct,” Warnock
  replies. “Beckenbauer would never have got on, would he, with the data? He’d
  have been playing Sunday league, Beckenbauer. “So we didn’t sign Van Dijk. He
  went to Southampton [for £13m]. I was with Cardiff a few years later, when we
  got to the Premier League, and I came up against him at Liverpool [who signed
  Van Dijk for £75m]. He came up and said: ‘Mr Warnock, you could have signed
  me’. I swore and said: ‘I bet you were glad that you were too slow for me.’ We
  had a laugh together.” “It just shows you. They can sign these great players
  on a computer but I was at Middlesbrough and they said they’d got a left-back
  for me,” Warnock goes on. “I watched him for five minutes and said: ‘He can’t
  defend. I don’t want him.’ They said: ‘But his stats show he’s got the most
  tackles, the most headers.’ I said: ‘Are you listening? He can’t defend.’
  Managers now are more or less coaches and they’re letting the recruitment team
  pick the players. But the data people don’t see the character of the person or
  other aspects of his game.” A freewheeling conversation with Warnock moves
  from memories of drinking pink champagne with Brian Clough to a bitter fallout
  with Sir Alex Ferguson. It includes recollections of eight promotions, five
  relegations, and a lot of pride. “I survived 1,627 games,” Warnock says. “When
  I started [at Gainsborough Trinity in 1980] I just wanted to survive a season.
  Let alone 45 years as a manager. Fucking hell. Frightening, isn’t it?”
  Warnock’s managerial career ended in March last year. He resigned after
  Aberdeen beat Kilmarnock 3-1 to reach the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup and,
  while he won’t discuss the reasons for his abrupt departure from Pittodrie
  after eight games, Warnock didn’t like off-field interference in his work. He
  is now a part-time consultant at Torquay United and hopes to help the club
  return to the Football League. But, in a sign of his diluted focus, the
  76-year-old’s attention is also on his upcoming tour, when he will appear at
  the London Palladium. Warnock sounds suitably gobsmacked in his unvarnished
  Sheffield accent. “When I was a kid, my mum had multiple sclerosis and my dad
  worked in the steelworks. But on a Sunday night I used to sit in front of my
  mum in her wheelchair and she played with my hair while as a family we watched
  Sunday Night at the London Palladium. So when these shows were being discussed
  I just said: ‘I’d love to do the Palladium.’ I didn’t suppose we could, but
  I’ll be thinking so much of my mum and dad. “In those days your dad never told
  you he loved you. It was macho. But he was a crane driver in the steelworks
  and after his 16-hour shifts he would come home to a wife with multiple
  sclerosis and three kids in a two-bedroom semi. You don’t appreciate what he
  must have gone through until years later.” Warnock’s distinctly human stories
  prompted Pep Guardiola to invite him into the Manchester City dressing room.
  Towards the end of last season Warnock spoke to a group of multimillionaire
  footballers, including Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland, and he grins now.
  “The first thing I said is: ‘I bet you lot think yourselves lucky you’ve not
  got me as your manager, because you’d be kicking the ball from there to there
  and it wouldn’t be on the ground.’ They all creased up. I said a few other
  things that made them laugh. Afterwards Pep said he’d enjoyed it so much and
  that you don’t get that now in football – the humour. He said: ‘Everything’s
  so methodical, so data-driven, blah-blah-blah.’ He said we miss that human
  element.” Warnock interviewed Guardiola for Sky Sports and, despite their
  mutual affection, there is an amusing clash of philosophies. Guardiola cackled
  through much of the interview but he looked almost bewildered when Warnock
  said: “We love man-marking.” After Guardiola said “You love, huh? Why?”
  Warnock explained that, as his teams were technically inferior, they had to
  try and nullify the opposition. “And the players,” Guardiola asked, “they
  support it? They like it?” Warnock’s immediate reaction – “well, they had to”
  – makes Guardiola smile again. As Warnock tells me now, “I never had a good
  team but I always had a good dressing room.” Warnock was old school. “When I
  were manager at Palace,” he says, “Man City brought down two buses full of
  staff. I thought: ‘Bloody hell, I’ve never seen ’owt like it.’ I got our kit
  man to chuck a bucket of cold water on the floor in their dressing room to
  make it scruffy as possible.” But there were occasions when Warnock was
  helpless. “At Cardiff we played City [in 2018] and had a couple of shots. It
  was 0-0 after 30 minutes and I’m thinking: ‘we’re doing well here’. Then we
  went in at half-time 2-0 down and after Bernardo Silva scored the second I’m
  saying out loud on the bench: ‘What a goal. That’s unbelievable.’ And I’m the
  opposition manager!” Cardiff lost 5-0 and were relegated that season when a
  controversial 2-1 defeat by Chelsea hastened their demise in May 2019. “It’s a
  lonely job, being a manager,” Warnock says. “I felt very lonely at times and
  probably the loneliest was at Cardiff when Chelsea got a goal that should have
  been disallowed for three yards offside. I knew that would relegate us. The
  dressing room was desolate because the lads had given me absolutely
  everything. I can tell you now the linesman was Ed Smart and Craig Pawson
  refereeing. I can see it as if it were yesterday. I’ll be looking at that on
  my grave. “I told the referee and linesman: ‘I wish you could come in my
  dressing room and see the desolation because you didn’t do your jobs right.’
  We didn’t deserve to go down that year.” Warnock was fined £20,000 for
  complaining about the officiating but now his attention reverts to Guardiola.
  “I noticed how much he was having to bite his tongue when you looked at the
  goals City conceded towards the end of last season. It wasn’t anything
  tactical. They were just bad mistakes. I knew it hurt him but he’s got the bit
  between his teeth again now. I’m going to be interested in seeing how they go
  this season because they’ll be a threat. Liverpool have spent all that money
  and Arsenal are spending as well, but Pep’s signed two or three good players.
  He’s the best manager since I’ve been around and I think he’ll prove it
  again.” When I ask Warnock for the top three managers he has faced, he
  responds with just two names. “I’d say Pep one and Arsène Wenger two because
  he changed the whole concept of football. Oh my God, his intelligence.”
  Warnock and Wenger also had an unlikely bromance. “He liked me and he
  respected me. It was said that Wenger never had any managers in his office
  after a game but he always invited me. On one occasion I even took my kids in
  and we had a picture in his office.” He frowns when I suggest it’s strange
  Ferguson has not been added to his top three. “I’d have to put Fergie in,” he
  says grudgingly. “But I’d have Pep and Arsène before him.” Warnock once spoke
  warmly of Ferguson and how the Scot would write to him encouragingly after
  every promotion and relegation. But his attitude has hardened now. “I don’t
  really want to talk about him because I’ve not got anything good to say.” Is
  that because Ferguson played a weakened Manchester United side against West
  Ham in the final game of the season in 2007? “Absolutely. Unforgivable, in my
  eyes. Same with [Liverpool’s] Rafa Benítez. He played the kids at Fulham that
  same year.” The pain for Warnock was intensified because Sheffield United, his
  boyhood team, were relegated after they lost at home to Wigan and West Ham
  stayed up after beating United by a solitary goal scored by Carlos Tevez,
  whose registration was thought to be ineligible by Warnock and many others.
  Has he spoken to Ferguson since that disastrous day? “No,” Warnock says with
  icy finality. He is happier discussing another managerial icon in Clough. “I
  was at Notts County [between 1989 and 1993] and Cloughie used to walk past our
  little training ground to get to their 10 acres where they had a fantastic
  training facility. He would be with [Clough’s assistant at Nottingham Forest]
  Alan Hill and a black labrador. Cloughie would walk across my pitch. He never
  walked around it and nobody said ’owt. He looked round at what we were doing,
  shook his head and walked on. Brilliant!” Warnock laughs before becoming more
  serious again. “We drew 1-1 at their place and at one of our lunches, he said:
  ‘You don’t realise, son, but it’s a remarkable job for a club like Notts
  County to be competing with us in the top division. It’ll never happen again,
  what you’ve done.’ And of course Notts County went from the old First Division
  to non-league football. “I’ve had eight promotions and if I went back to these
  clubs tomorrow, I’d get a great reception. I got Cardiff in the Premier
  League. Look where they are now. To get Notts County in the top flight? If I
  had a fashionable name or I were a fashionable manager, I think I’d have got
  more acknowledgment. But they gave me an award this year at the Football
  League, for my contribution to the EFL.” Warnock sinks back in his chair and
  smiles: “I thought: ‘Bloody hell. It’s about time!’” Neil Warnock: Are You
  With Me? is at Opera House, Manchester on 29 August, London Palladium on 18
  September and Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol on 28 September. Tickets at

  earlier version said Neil Warnock started his managerial career at
  Gainsborough Town; however, this should have said Gainsborough Trinity.
