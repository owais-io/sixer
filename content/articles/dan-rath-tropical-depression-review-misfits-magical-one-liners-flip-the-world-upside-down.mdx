  Dan Rath: Tropical Depression review – misfit’s magical one-liners flip the
  world upside down

bodyText: >-
  You could write theses on comedy’s relationship with social maladjustment.
  Many a standup, we imagine, was once an awkward kid making people laugh to fit
  in – and not all of them grow out of that awkwardness. Dan Rath is a comic as
  uneasy in his skin as the most afflicted of classroom misfits, barely meeting
  our gaze as he rattles off one one-liner after another. Happily, those
  one-liners zing as zingily as any in town, disruptive little thoughts that
  flagellate Rath himself and flip the world upside down – or at least reveal it
  anew through the downturned eyes of a man excluded from its pleasures, and
  liberated from its pieties too. You could compile an entire joke-of-the-fringe
  list from Tropical Depression alone – although no reputable outlet could
  publish it without a trigger warning. Rath’s is a bleak worldview, forged in
  rejection, medication and alienation from the humbug of modern life. Zero per
  cent alcohol? Ghosting? ADHD? Our host has a skewed take on them all, and
  he’ll leave it planted in your head. Then there’s the running commentary his
  performance provides on its own, in-the-moment failure: Rath is like an
  anti-comedian in his fidgety refusal to allow momentum to build. The
  difference from anti-comedy, though, is that these gags are pearlers. Look at
  his joke about the ironies of Ozempic distribution, say, or the one about Rath
  and his brother being prescribed lithium: in both, classic joke construction
  marries with audacious leaps of the imagination to brilliantly animate the
  Aussie comic’s political and personal way of seeing. Most of his material
  combines embittered social alienation with scepticism of fashionable nostrums,
  as when he sees a “Live Love Laugh” embroidered on a cushion by an enslaved
  person “doing the opposite”. There’s no shape or theme to any of this. That
  would compromise the conceit of a fragile outpatient who seems inadvisedly to
  have found himself on stage: “Usually,” he deadpans, “my carer has tasered me
  by now.” Let us be glad they haven’t, because there’s fun to be had in the
  space between Rath’s painfully introverted performance style and a joke-world
  that’s fantastically expansive. • At Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 August
