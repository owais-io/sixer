  As deputy US attorney Todd Blanche announced last week that the justice
  department would release transcripts of his interview with Ghislaine Maxwell,
  he described this disclosure as being “in the interest of transparency”.
  “Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed.
  Nothing hidden,” Blanche also said of his two-day sit down with Maxwell, who
  was convicted sex trafficking in relation to Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of
  teenage girls. That same day, James Comer, the House oversight committee
  chair, said that the justice department had sent a large tranche of Epstein
  investigative documents in response to a congressional subpoena. Comer praised
  justice officials and Donald Trump, saying: “The Trump DoJ is moving at a pace
  far faster than anything ever produced by the Biden DoJ.” Trump, who has faced
  extensive political blowback over his administration’s handling of the Epstein
  files, also voiced support for transparency. “I’m in support of them keeping
  it open. Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it
  totally open,” he said. While those supportive of Trump have touted these
  actions as a show of openness, many others have pointed to the questions left
  unasked – and the people who have not been asked anything at all – as
  indicating that these disclosures about Epstein were more of a show than any
  real push for truth. For them the Maxwell transcripts, and the ignoring of
  victim’s voices, are not a sign of openness; they are a sign of a reluctance
  to pursue any potentially dangerous truth. For example, Blanche asked Maxwell
  whether people around Epstein – including the numerous high-profile and
  powerful men who had known him – were associating with him for the purpose of
  sexual encounters. In her reply Maxwell said that some of the “cast of
  characters” around Epstein were “in your cabinet, who you value as your
  co-workers”. Despite the fact that Maxwell had just openly mentioned Epstein
  associates as being in Trump’s current cabinet, Blanche – a hardened lawyer
  not known for missing a trick in trial argument – did not pause to ask Maxwell
  to identify the cabinet members she was referring to. At another point in the
  interview, Blanche asked Maxwell had ever had contact with Mossad, Israel’s
  intelligence agency. “Well, not deliberately,” Maxwell said. Blanche
  responded: “Pardon me?” She again said “not deliberately” and Blanche then
  moved on to a question about whether Epstein was receiving money from any
  intelligence agency. Blanche also seemed to indulge Maxwell’s repeated
  professions of spotty recollection, including in response to questions about
  whether Trump penned a letter for Epstein’s birthday book, as had been
  reported by the Wall Street Journal. Blanche, prefacing a question with the
  phrase, “I understand you don’t remember anything with President Trump or a
  lot about the book anyway,” asked: “Do you remember asking President Trump to
  submit a letter for that?” Maxwell said: “I do not.” “Do you remember – would
  you have been the one to do that or could somebody else – would somebody else
  have done that?” Blanche asked. “I did ask some people. I don’t remember Mr
  Trump. I don’t remember who I did ask, but Epstein also asked people himself
  directly.” Blanche responded: “OK.” He did not pursue the obvious line of
  thought that Maxwell’s response suggested: had Epstein reached out to Trump?
  Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is the founder of West Coast
  Trial Lawyers, said: “Many of Blanche’s questions were surface-level and
  didn’t drill down the way lawyers, especially prosecutors, do when they want
  to catch inconsistencies.” “She has zero credibility and I don’t believe for a
  second that she saw nothing and knows nothing,” Rahmani said. “Perhaps
  Blanche’s questions were more of the softball variety, but there was no world
  where Maxwell was going to implicate herself when she has her supreme court
  appeal pending or anyone in the administration when she is trying to get a
  presidential pardon.” For victims’ representatives and advocates, the issue
  with unasked questions also extends to who hasn’t been asked questions.
  Several attorneys, representing more than a total of 50 Epstein and Maxwell,
  survivors told the Guardian that the justice department had not reached out
  for sit-downs with them. “Despite the fact that we have successfully
  represented 11 Epstein victims, no one has reached out,” said attorney Lisa
  Bloom. Spencer Kuvin, who has represented multiple Epstein survivors,
  commented: “We have heard nothing from the DoJ or the house subcommittee
  regarding request to speak with either the attorneys for the victims or the
  victims. I have repeatedly advised that I am willing to volunteer to provide
  testimony at their request. The victims have been ignored in this entire
  process.” Another attorney said: “I have received updates from the justice
  department, but no requests to speak to my clients.” Gretchen Carlson and
  Julie Roginsky, who filed sexual harassment suits against former Fox News CEO
  Roger Ailes and co-founded the non-profit Lift Our Voices, said that the
  approach has ignored those who were abused by Epstein and Maxwell. “If they
  actually had survivors in mind, if you were thoughtful about them, they would
  be able to talk to them, and then we’d be consulting subscribers and lawyers
  to make sure inquiries were unfolding in the way they wanted,” Carlson said.
  “Nobody is doubting that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked young girls. Nobody is
  doubting that Jeffrey Epstein was not the only man who raped these young
  girls,” Roginsky said. “All we need to do is listen to these survivors as they
  tell us who these others are.” “Ghislaine Maxwell is a convicted sex
  trafficker and felon who has been previously accused of lying under oath. Her
  conversations with United States deputy attorney general Todd Blanche reveal
  nothing shocking; Maxwell provided a version of the truth that best suits her
  agenda, in an attempt to continue concealing her wrongdoings,” said Jennifer
  Freeman, an attorney for Epstein survivors and special counsel at Marsh Law
  Firm. “For far too long survivors have been left in the dark, shut out and
  shunted aside from receiving vital information in their most painful hours.”
  The House oversight committee says it is in contact with Epstein survivors and
  that there will be a bipartisan meeting with them on 2 September. Ro Khanna, a
  California Democrat on the oversight committee, said in a statement that just
  3% of the documents the justice department gave to the committee were new and
  that “the rest are already in the public domain.” “Less than 1% of files have
  been released. DoJ is stonewalling. The survivors deserve justice and the
  public deserves transparency.” Khanna said he is holding a press conference
  with survivors on 3 September to “hear from them why releasing this
  information is so important”. Asked about Blanche’s interview style or whether
  there had been any outreach to victims, the justice department said “no
  comment.”
