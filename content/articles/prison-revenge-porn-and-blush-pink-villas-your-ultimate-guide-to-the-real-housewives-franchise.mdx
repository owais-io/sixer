  Whether you’re a devout worshipper at the altar of The Real Housewives (like
  me), or simply aware of it by osmosis, there’s no denying it’s one of reality
  TV’s most wildly successful franchises. Since it debuted in 2006 with a peek
  into Orange county’s elite, the franchise now spans more than a dozen US
  cities and has extended internationally from Sydney to Dubai. Now, nearly 20
  years later, London is calling. Despite its title, the show isn’t really about
  marriage (most of the women aren’t married, and those who are usually at some
  point during their tenure experience a messy divorce). What the franchise
  captures is something far more compelling: a specific sort of midlife
  reinvention. We watch as women (mostly over the age of 40) navigate divorce,
  grief, success, self-discovery and the pursuit of fame. As the former Real
  Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville put it: “Andy Cohen [the
  show’s executive producer] is the only man in Hollywood who hires women over
  40.” One of the most enduring qualities of the Real Housewives is that it
  doesn’t produce throwaway reality stars – it creates cultural icons. Unlike
  much of reality television, which sees contestants flare up and burn out
  within a season (or even a few episodes), the Housewives universe invites
  long-term investment. We follow these women for years (and in the case of
  Beverly Hills, Atlanta or the OC, for well over a decade) as friendships
  fracture (always with a healthy amount of drama), marriages begin and end and
  children grow up (and we can now watch the housewives’ offspring on the
  spin-off Next Gen NYC). In a genre built on instant gratification and rapid
  turnover, Housewives rewards patience. It feels less like disposable content
  and more like weekly event television – something to savour and return to,
  season after season (and rewatch obsessively). This is how Real Housewives
  cultivates community. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been at a work
  event or awkward dinner where the mere mention of the women lights people up –
  suddenly, you’re not strangers, you’re part of a devoted tribe, debating
  whether the new New York cast are any good (spoiler: they will never be the
  same), or reeling from the news that the self-appointed grand dame of Potomac
  herself, Karen Huger, has been sentenced to prison. Once you’re in, you’re in.
  And once you’ve found your franchise, there’s no going back. That being said,
  the Real Housewives ecosystem holds a mammoth vault of episodes and choosing
  where to start can feel as daunting as it is exciting. The good news is that
  you can quite literally start anywhere. Each city offers something different,
  depending on what mood you’re in. Beverly Hills serves bitchy opulence (think
  Lisa Vanderpump’s blush-pink Villa Rosa). The original New York cast was truly
  wild – Ramona Singer’s wide-eyed expressions are permanently etched in my
  memory, and Countess Luann’s song Money Can’t Buy You Class remains a
  certified banger. Atlanta will have you howling with laughter, delivering some
  of the best lines in the entire franchise. Then there is The Real Housewives
  of Salt Lake City, which has already cemented its place as one of the
  franchise’s greatest hits, despite being a newer addition. Largely because the
  show is based in Utah (the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
  Saints), it landed a scandal right out of the gate, complete with federal
  indictments. One of the housewives, Jen Shah, became the centre of national
  attention following her 2021 arrest and subsequent guilty plea for wire fraud.
  Forever surrounded by numerous assistants (doing God knows what), Shah
  projected a lifestyle many suspected was funded by more than just her show
  salary. The drama drew high-profile fans such as Rihanna. There was also the
  infamous “How did Heather get a black eye?” mystery. Heather Gay, one of the
  RHOSLC wives and author of the New York Times bestseller Bad Mormon, later
  revealed it was allegedly caused by Shah, who is now serving time alongside
  Elizabeth Holmes (of Theranos fame), and paparazzi have even captured shots of
  them together in prison. Most recently, the show has offered some moments that
  will tug on even the coldest of heartstrings – particularly involving Mary
  Cosby (who, yes, famously married her step-grandfather). This season, Cosby’s
  usually reserved demeanour gave way to vulnerability as her son’s visible
  struggle with drug addiction unfolded on screen in a way that substance issues
  had never before been spoken about within the network. My personal greatest
  love has to be The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It is a masterclass in shade
  and comedic brilliance. Just look at Phaedra Parks, who serves the coldest
  reads with the unflappable poise of a lawyer and embalmer (yes, she’s both).
  Kim Zolciak, the only white woman in the original cast, insisted on wearing
  weaves. Then there’s Kenya Moore, who was the perfect villain – eventually
  getting booted due to season 16’s revenge porn debacle – in which she used her
  haircare launch to allegedly project explicit footage purporting to be of
  another cast member. Atlanta also introduced the world to NeNe Leakes – one of
  the rare Housewives to cross over into mainstream entertainment, landing a
  recurring role on Glee, a stint on The New Normal and Broadway roles in
  Cinderella and Chicago. She had, and has, actual star power. And what to
  expect from The Real Housewives of London? Six women from the city’s
  wealthiest circles (with genuinely pre-existing relationships). Making a
  return to reality TV is the Ladies of London alum Juliet Angus, the
  fashion-savvy American who’s already generating excitement among longtime
  fans. She’s joined by the skincare CEO Amanda Cronin, who may be stepping into
  the villain role – if the teaser is anything to go by. In one scene, she’s
  seen yelling: “Go back to Paddington!” and edging close to one of the other
  wives, though she has described herself as “the light in every room”. There’s
  the party planner and former pageant queen Juliet Mayhew, and Karen
  Loderick-Pierce, whose early love of fashion came from her grandfather (part
  of the Windrush generation), who used to send her clothes from London to
  Jamaica. Early teasers hint she may emerge as the show’s confessional queen.
  Rounding out the group is Panthea Parker, who describes the show as “stiff
  upper lip meets crazy Housewives”. She can apparently drop £140,000 on a
  single shopping spree without batting a false eyelash. And finally, there’s
  Nessie Welschinger, a financier turned baker and self-professed tiger mum. The
  trailer teases high society and even higher drama. The same is true of the
  extensions to the franchise: the (three-part!) reunions and spin-off shows.
  One of the longest-standing cast members of The Real Housewives of Atlanta,
  Kandi Burruss – formerly of the R&amp;B group Xscape (she also co-wrote Bills
  Bills Bills for Destiny’s Child) – has Kandi &amp; the Gang (featuring her
  family and restaurant). Meanwhile Zolciak, another original Atlanta housewife,
  headlined her own spin-off, Don’t Be Tardy, which chronicled her home life
  with her husband, Kroy Biermann, and their blended family in a more domestic,
  sitcom-style format. It would be remiss not to mention “Scandoval” from
  Vanderpump Rules, one of Lisa Vanderpump’s spin-offs, which was quite possibly
  Bravo’s most viral betrayal to date. Tom Sandoval, a longtime cast member, was
  caught cheating on his long-term partner, Ariana Madix, with their co-star
  Raquel Leviss. The drama played out across social media platforms like
  Instagram, (then) Twitter and dedicated Vanderpump Rules subreddits, on which
  fans recalled exactly where they were the moment “Scandoval broke”, often
  noting the precise day and time it dropped. Viewers also debated timelines and
  theories about how long Sandoval and Leviss had been seeing each other before
  the reveal, fuelling endless speculation and discussion online. The
  controversy elevated Madix to almost “god-like” status with brand deals
  aplenty. It was reality TV at its operatic best. In addition to the spin-offs,
  the last couple of years have seen frankly drastic makeovers across the
  franchise. New York ushered in its influencer era – a complete recast
  featuring younger women with strong social media presences – and has been
  renewed, cancelled and reportedly renewed (and cancelled) again. Atlanta has
  welcomed a completely new cast – bringing back OG Porsha Williams and finally
  elevating her bestie (at least until they appeared on the show together) and
  longtime “friend of the show” Shamea Morton to full-time cast member with her
  own intro and storyline. Orange County has blended returning originals such as
  Shannon Beador and Tamra Judge with newer voices – with some hitting and
  failing to land. The Real Housewives of London offers those still hungry for
  yet another universe to lose themselves in – this time, with a completely
  clean slate. Whether it becomes an instant fan favourite remains to be seen,
  but one thing is certain: even for those who’ve never sat through a full
  episode, these women are firmly embedded in the cultural mainstream and
  thankfully, they’re not going anywhere. The joy of Housewives is that no
  matter where you begin, it’s never long before you’re all in. • The Real
  Housewives of London is on Hayu in the UK on 18 August
