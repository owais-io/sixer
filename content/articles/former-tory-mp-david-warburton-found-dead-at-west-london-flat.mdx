  A former Conservative MP who quit politics after allegations of sexual
  misconduct and drug taking has been found dead aged 59. David Warburton, who
  represented the Somerton and Frome constituency until June 2023, was found
  dead at the west London flat last week. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan
  police said: “Police were called by the London ambulance service at 10.47am on
  Tuesday 26 August. “A man in his 50s was found dead at the scene. His next of
  kin have been informed. His death is being treated as unexpected but not
  suspicious.” Warburton announced that he was resigning his safe seat two years
  ago, having been suspended by his party in April 2022 pending the outcome of
  an independent complaints and grievance scheme investigation into allegations
  of harassment and drug use. His resignation led to a byelection, which the Lib
  Dems won. Warburton admitted taking cocaine after drinking “incredibly potent”
  Japanese whisky, but denied harassment and claimed he was denied a fair
  hearing over claims that he made unwanted advances to two women. In July 2023,
  the House of Commons said the investigation against him “will no longer be
  proceeding”. Warburton said he was overjoyed but that it had been
  “extraordinarily difficult for my family and myself, with the personal toll
  being incalculable”. Warburton became MP for the Somerset constituency in
  2015, securing the country’s biggest swing to the Tories. He won again in 2019
  with a majority of more than 19,000. Warburton turned heads in Westminster
  when he lost six stone in less than a year, having previously been classed as
  obese. He said he had “got a bit obsessed” with using a home gym during the
  first Covid lockdown, and won plaudits from then health secretary, Matt
  Hancock, for his newfound fitness fanaticism. Multiple Tory MPs told the
  Guardian in 2022 that upon his return to Westminster, his reinvention seemed
  like a “mid-life crisis”, though when the allegations about his behaviour
  emerged, colleagues said they were shocked. The former Labour MP Simon
  Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate
  messages to a 17-year-old girl, said on X: “Sad to see that David Warburton,
  former Conservative MP, has died. Cleared by parliament of any wrongdoing, but
  like most of us wasn’t flawless, he’d just had enough and resigned. With him a
  few times recently, he was doing really well. God bless him.”
