  fuelled a birth-rate crisis in Ukraine

  It was one of the most horrifying targets of Russia’s war on Ukraine so far.
  Reports showed a pregnant woman on a stretcher, her face ashen with shock,
  legs smeared with blood and a hand holding her bump. Behind her, the
  bombed-out ruins of Mariupol’s maternity hospital. More than a dozen people,
  including women in labour, were injured in the attack in March 2022. The woman
  photographed, Iryna Kalinina, later died along with her unborn baby. In the
  three years since then, maternity care in Ukraine has remained under constant
  attack, with more than 2,000 strikes on medical facilities, including 81
  affecting maternal care and delivery rooms. Just last month, Diana Koshyk,
  seven months pregnant, was killed when a missile struck a maternity hospital
  in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. Over the past month, the Guardian has
  visited three maternity hospitals on the frontline to witness how Russia’s
  full-scale invasion and attacks on healthcare facilities have taken away
  women’s fundamental right to a safe childbirth. At each hospital, women and
  the staff working there face terrible danger: circling drones, artillery,
  ballistic missiles and the targeted degradation of healthcare infrastructure.
  They risk themselves to bring new life into a country where there are now
  three deaths for every birth. Even with renewed hopes for an end to the war,
  Russia’s brutal tactics have fuelled a demographic crisis for Ukraine.
  Millions of women and children have fled the country, hundreds of thousands of
  people have been killed, and those women who remained have been left fearful
  of pregnancy and childbirth. In 2024, Ukraine suffered the lowest birthrate in
  the world and the highest mortality rate, according to the CIA’s World
  Factbook. Kharkiv The hospital in Kharkiv delivered about 1,000 babies a year
  before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Last year, that figure fell to
  less than 440 – two-thirds of women of child-bearing age have fled the city.
  The figure would be even lower but more women are attending as other hospitals
  in the city stop operating. Just five days before our arrival in late July,
  the maternity building of Kharkiv’s main hospital had been damaged in a drone
  strike. As the windows were blown in and glass sprayed across beds, the women
  – some pregnant, others with newborns and one in active labour – were rushed
  across the river to a perinatal centre for urgent medical care. All were
  suffering from shock, but the woman in labour needed an urgent caesarean
  section. Staff operated quickly and mother and baby survived. Such bombardment
  has become all too common in Kharkiv, which has been under heavy and sustained
  attack since the first hours of the war. In June, the city was hit with the
  largest number of attacks since the full-scale invasion began. At the
  perinatal centre now taking care of women, doctors say they have delivered
  babies in the middle of air attacks, and carried out surgery while bouncing up
  and down from the impact of explosions. The city itself is heavily scarred by
  war. Broken glass lines the pavements outside the hospital, while two
  buildings opposite lie derelict after suffering damage. The centre’s windows
  are filled with sandbags, their plastic panes crossed with tape to contain any
  breakage. Power cuts are routine, with caesareans having been carried out by
  torchlight in the past. It is a lot of stress to contend with if you are
  pregnant. Doctors say they have seen medical complications and breakdowns –
  one new mother refused to take her child home after she learned her husband
  had been killed at the front. The hospital now employs a psychologist to help
  ease the fears of women who are reluctant to even come to the hospital due to
  the risk it could be hit. When Olga Shevela, 30, went into labour, she had to
  travel to the hospital as Shahed drones buzzed above the road. “I was worried
  the hospital could be targeted, but I had no choice but to give birth,” she
  says, rocking one-day-old Zahar. They ended up in the hospital’s bomb shelter
  just hours after delivery as almost 20 explosions hit the city. When the air
  raid sirens wail, women stream through corridors towards the shelter in
  varying states of health. It is too dangerous to take the lift in case the
  hospital is hit, so they contend with the stairs. Some are trailed by nurses
  steadying portable intravenous drips, others cradle tiny infants. Those in the
  late stages of labour, undergoing surgery or who are recovering from an
  operation are too fragile to move and have to stay behind. Early in the war,
  births were improvised in what was then a dusty basement, but it has now been
  converted to include beds and a delivery room. It is not sterile enough for
  surgery but they can accommodate births and there are enough provisions for
  three days. Dasha Borisenko, 32, has suffered two miscarriages and is now
  living full-time at the hospital to protect a high-risk pregnancy – she is not
  due until January. She was living in a village in the eastern Sumy region
  along the Russian border, which is now enduring some of the worst fighting.
  She has not seen her husband for two weeks because they are concerned about
  military recruitment teams on the roads. “I really want to have a child but
  with this war, it is difficult to manage,” she says. Sloviansk Sloviansk’s
  population has halved since the invasion began, from more than 100,000 to
  about 53,000. Births at the hospital have dropped from more than 1,000 a year
  to about 550. The figure is kept higher because the hospital now takes
  patients from a broader area as other maternity facilities have become
  unavailable. Liliia Eroshenko, 36, was at home and heavily pregnant in July
  when she heard that three Shahed drones had crashed into the main building of
  Sloviansk hospital. Eroshenko and her husband had delayed having a child for
  three years because they were waiting for the war to end, but with no sign of
  peace they “couldn’t wait for ever”. They were fearful that the maternity
  building – a short walk from the main hospital – would be the next Russian
  target. Four days after the bombardment, the maternity unit has so far been
  spared and Eroshenko is tending to her two-day-old daughter, Milana, who
  wriggles in a box in front of her. With the future of the city so uncertain,
  she is now considering fleeing to the west of the country, but worries that
  nowhere in Ukraine is safe. One of her biggest fears is that her husband will
  be mobilised. “There is no safe place left in Sloviansk,” she says. “We hear
  explosions every day.” In the same room as Eroshenko, Vitalii Chernetskyi, 31,
  cradles his two-day-old daughter, Daria. Blinded in one eye, he is on
  indefinite leave after being injured at the front while his wife was pregnant.
  “Children are our happiness – they should be born,” he says. The hospital
  building that was hit now lies in ruins – burnt out, partially collapsed, with
  huge twists of metal roofing flung metres away. Diggers were clearing away
  rubble and glass when the Guardian visited, as artillery shelling boomed in
  the distance. The maternity unit is the last one to remain functional in
  Ukrainian-held Donbas, the colloquial term used to describe the eastern
  industrial heartlands of Donetsk and Luhansk that have been partially occupied
  since 2014. All the others have either closed, been destroyed or are under
  occupation. Lying less than 20 miles from a shifting frontline, women travel
  from as far as 100 miles away to give birth here. They face drones, artillery,
  missiles and reconnaissance sabotage groups. People try to avoid public spaces
  due to regular attacks and endure routine electricity cuts as well as
  espionage – an alleged Russian agent was detained in Sloviansk during our
  visit for collecting information about Ukraine’s military. The maternity
  hospital has lost several members of staff to attacks on the city, while
  midwives say there are more premature births and a rise in cancers, especially
  of the uterus. “We saw the same jump after 2014,” says Valentyna Hlushchenko,
  62, director of obstetrics and gynaecology. “Women breathe in particles in the
  air from the daily explosions,” she says. “They also wait too long to ask for
  help when something is wrong.” Kherson The population in the city was 280,000
  before the invasion and less than quarter of its residents remain. Its
  maternity unit used to handle 1,500 to 2,000 births a year, but now only sees
  about 120. About 100 people have been killed and 1,100 injured in the city
  this year. In a windowless underground maternity hospital in Kherson, Kateryna
  Osetsymska, 35, is sitting in bed in a spotted hospital gown, her face wet
  with tears. Outside, heavy booms sound as explosives are fired back and forth
  across the river – with Russian forces about half a mile away. Osetsymska was
  admitted a week ago for her safety. She is 33 weeks pregnant and considered
  high risk – doctors say there are some complications with her uterus. “I’m
  certain it’s because of stress,” she says. Since the start of the full-scale
  invasion the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, has been attacked with
  everything from tanks to guided aerial bombs, drones and multilaunch rocket
  systems. The city’s maternity hospital No 2 has been damaged five times and
  now operates underground in a state-of-the-art basement refurbishment that
  includes delivery, surgery and recovery rooms. The day before the Guardian’s
  visit, explosives dropped by a remotely guided “first-person view” (FPV) drone
  narrowly missed the hospital and hit the car park. “Kherson doesn’t have a
  medical facility that has been hit less than four or five times,” says the
  head of obstetrics, Petro Marenkovskyi. “We are 100% confident Russia is
  targeting us deliberately.” The city’s proximity to Russian forces means there
  is little chance of a siren warning before an explosion. Artillery or mortar
  fire hits just three seconds after launch and if people hear a Russian fighter
  jet is in the sky, they only have five minutes to find somewhere to hide from
  guided aerial bombs. Residents are stalked by FPV drones that drop explosives
  with chilling precision, often hitting civilians. Doctors say they face
  extreme risk even coming to work; we are warned that a Russian reconnaissance
  drone is flying above the hospital during our visit. The constant stress, says
  the head of obstetrics in Kherson, means higher risk of miscarriages, more
  haemorrhages and an increased rate of surgical intervention. Things were worse
  during almost nine months of occupation in 2022 when people hid in their
  houses and women went without medical care; a steep rise in stillbirths
  followed. Osetsymska says she was pregnant with her youngest child during the
  occupation and unable to travel from her village, with no access to doctors or
  medical care. “You can’t erase the horrible stuff we have been through with
  this war. “But my big hope is that my baby will live, and that they get a
  chance to enjoy childhood,” she says.
