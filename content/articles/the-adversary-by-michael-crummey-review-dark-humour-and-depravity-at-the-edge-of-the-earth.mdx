  The Adversary by Michael Crummey review – dark humour and depravity at the
  edge of the Earth

  Several years have passed since Michael Crummey’s last novel The Innocents was
  published in the UK in 2020. A pandemic has since occurred and, appropriately
  perhaps, The Adversary begins on a dark note of contagion. “There was a
  killing sickness on the shore that winter and the only services at the church
  were funerals,” runs the opening line, setting the tone for a book that plumbs
  the depths of depravity but – thanks to its energy, and its ripe and
  adventurous language – never loses a black sense of humour. Having now won the
  30th annual Dublin Literary award, worth €100,000, The Adversary is proof that
  Crummey is beginning to garner the accolades he deserves beyond his native
  Canada. Crummey hails from Newfoundland; all six of his novels are set there.
  He understands the power of lashing sea, scouring wind, an eked-out existence
  far from what many consider to be civilisation. In The Innocents he told a
  kind of Adam-and-Eve story of two children left alone to raise themselves in a
  shack in the early years of the 19th century. Supplies are occasionally
  brought in a ship called the Hope; its black-clad captain is known as the
  Beadle. There is no need to read The Innocents to enjoy The Adversary, but
  it’s a pleasure to spot the connection. The new novel is set in a town called
  Mockbeggar, and the Beadle is one of its itinerant grandees. This is the
  Canadian frontier, the harried edge of wilderness, though in comparison with
  the world of The Innocents the municipality’s physical comforts seem
  positively Parisian. Despite the prevalence of funerals, the reader encounters
  a wedding in the novel’s opening pages. It is between a trembling girl, Anna
  Morels, brought over from far-off Jersey, and Abe Strapp, one of the grandees
  of Mockbeggar, the two syllables of his name landing like blows. “He was a
  fright for a child to look upon as a prospective husband, bacon-faced, with a
  small full mouth that gave him the air of a greedy infant.” He turns out to be
  worse than a greedy infant – Strapp is a brutal tyrant whose violent whims are
  the scourge of Mockbeggar. The marriage will not, in fact, take place: as in a
  gothic tale, an impediment is presented when another girl, Imogen Purchase, is
  revealed to have been impregnated by Strapp – or at least such testimony is
  given – and she becomes his forlorn bride. Neither girl’s fate is enviable. If
  you ever entertained romantic ideas of what it might be like to live in a wild
  and isolated place in centuries past, Crummey’s work will disabuse you of such
  idle fancy. The book’s true mechanism, however, is the rivalry between Strapp
  and a woman we first meet as the Widow Caines. I am not the first critic to
  note that, like The Innocents, The Adversary plays on another story in
  Genesis, that of Cain and Abel; later in the book we find a kind of trinity,
  too, in the three young people who are the leavening element of goodness and
  go by the resonant names of Solemn, Bride and Lazarus. The novel’s blurb
  compares it to Deadwood, David Milch’s brilliant HBO series from the early
  00s. It is an apt analogy, and not only because both present a portrait of a
  society forged under duress. Plot doesn’t, strictly speaking, drive the tale.
  Rather, Crummey and Milch alike have built nuanced portraits of the
  allegiances that must be forged in adversity, and the enmities that arrive not
  only from longstanding hatreds but from scarce resources too. And, like Milch,
  Crummey luxuriates in vivid swearing and slang. The Widow Caines dresses in
  her late husband’s clothes to run her business – she dismisses a skirt as a
  “fucksail”. The madam of the whorehouse, known as the Abbess, refers to the
  use to which the servant’s room in her domicile has been put: “‘The blanket
  hornpipe,’ she said. ‘The goat’s jig. Clicket. Making feet for children’s
  stockings.’” In his acknowledgments the author bows to the 1811 edition of
  Francis Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, now freely available online
  for all to peruse. You won’t be sorry if you do. Crummey is a wise and
  unsparing writer whose understanding of human foibles retains a scrap of
  empathy even for his blackest creations. The bloody denouement of The
  Adversary is well earned. The title, if we think along biblical lines, refers
  to the devil, but Crummey shows that the Adversary is in all of us, just
  waiting – alas – to be released. • The Adversary by Michael Crummey is
  published by Serpent’s Tail (£9.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy
