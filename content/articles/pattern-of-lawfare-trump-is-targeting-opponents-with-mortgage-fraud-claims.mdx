  Donald Trump and his allies have been accused of executing a “pattern of
  lawfare” akin to those exerted by authoritarian regimes in Hungary and Russia
  after adopting a new strategy to target political opponents: allegations of
  mortgage fraud. First it was Letitia James, the New York attorney general,
  then it was Adam Schiff, a California senator. Now, the president is targeting
  Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, demanding she resign and threatening to
  fire her. Cook, the first Black woman to be appointed a Fed governor, was
  appointed in 2022 by Joe Biden. Her 14-year term is not due to expire until
  2038. Leading this new strategy is Bill Pulte, heir to a home construction
  company fortune, appointed by Trump to lead the Federal Housing Finance
  Agency, which oversees regulations of federal housing lenders Fannie Mae and
  Freddie Mac. Pulte has used his role to publicly accuse Trump’s opponents,
  publishing extraordinary allegations on social media and referring them for
  investigation. He alleges that James, Schiff and Cook committed what is known
  as owner-occupancy fraud, when a person claims a second home or investment
  property is actually a primary residence to get better mortgages. Lenders are
  more inclined to give borrowers a lower mortgage on a primary residence,
  compared with a second home or investment property. In a letter to the
  Department of Justice, Pulte claimed that Cook “falsified bank documents and
  property records to acquire more favorable loan terms”. In other online posts
  and on TV news appearances, Pulte said that Cook should resign or be fired
  over the allegations, which have not been verified. James and Schiff have
  denied the allegations. Cook has pledged to “provide the facts” after
  gathering the relevant information. Trump allies have celebrated the
  accusations, citing it as evidence of corruption within the Democratic party.
  “This is not just hypocrisy, this is poetic justice,” said Fox conservative
  commentator Laura Ingraham, of Schiff’s fraud accusations, in a clip Trump
  reposted to social media. While Pulte has targeted two prominent Democrats and
  a Democratic appointee, accusations of such fraud are not exclusive to the
  party: an investigation by the Associated Press found Texas attorney general
  Ken Paxton, a Republican and staunch Trump ally, and his then wife claimed
  that three homes were their primary residences. Though Paxton has not
  commented on his own mortgage fraud accusations, he had said of the
  accusations against attorney general James: “I hope that if she’s done
  something wrong, I hope that she’s held accountable.” Owner-occupancy fraud is
  not uncommon. Philadelphia Fed researchers in 2023 estimated that over 20,000
  loans were given to “fraudulent investors”, or people who purchased more than
  one home they listed as a primary residence within a year. Some political
  experts have raised concerns that the president and his allies are blatantly
  using the legal system to intimidate political opponents. “The fact that the
  law is being selectively applied underlines that this is part of a pattern of
  lawfare,” Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of
  Michigan, told the Guardian via email. “What we are seeing is the type of
  weaponization we associate with authoritarian regimes, like Hungary, Turkey or
  Russia,” Moynihan added. “I would say that this is a massive warning sign, but
  the reality is that we have seen so many of these signs at this point.”
  Contacted for comment, a US federal housing spokesperson said: “We refer
  people of all political parties for mortgage fraud, and we will continue to do
  so.” A White House official said: “Anyone who engages in criminal activity
  should be held accountable. No one is above the law.” ‘No intention of being
  bullied’ That Trump is targeting a Fed governor speaks to the president’s
  continued antagonism against the Federal Reserve. Compared with James or
  Schiff, both of whom have headed investigations against Trump, Cook has not
  singled herself out as an enemy to the president. But her role on the
  12-person Fed governing board that sets interest rates has probably made her a
  target. Since taking office in January, Trump has demanded the central bank
  cut rates, disregarding the precedent set by his predecessors; the Fed has
  historically been treated as an independent institution, free from political
  influence, by past presidents. The Fed board hasn’t yet lowered rates during
  any of the five meetings it had this year, which has infuriated Trump.
  Policymakers, including the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell, say the
  administration’s tariffs have clouded the economic outlook and raises the risk
  of higher inflation. Pulte has pushed himself into the heart of the action,
  criticizing the Fed on social media and reportedly even drafting a letter for
  Trump – which remains unsent – to fire Powell. “Jerome Powell’s career is
  done,” Pulte wrote in July. “Could somebody please inform Jerome ‘Too Late’
  Powell that he is hurting the housing industry very badly? People can’t get a
  mortgage because of him,” Trump wrote on social media earlier this week.
  Trump’s gut-reaction to seize control of the Fed is to fire Powell, but
  neither the stock market nor the US supreme court have responded kindly to
  such threats. So, Trump, with Pulte’s help, has spent the summer following
  other tactics. In July, Trump zeroed in on renovations that were taking place
  at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington DC, claiming that the renovations were
  fraudulent because they were more expensive than what was originally budgeted,
  costing $2.5bn instead of $1.9bn. The Fed put this down to complications that
  came up during renovations. But as criticisms of the renovations died down,
  Trump started zeroing in on Cook. Her exit would allow Trump to appoint a
  replacement who may be more sympathetic to his desire for lower rates. In a
  statement, Cook said that she has “no intention of being bullied to step down
  from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet”, adding: “I do
  intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member
  of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to
  answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.” On Friday, Trump
  threatened to fire her if she did not resign.
