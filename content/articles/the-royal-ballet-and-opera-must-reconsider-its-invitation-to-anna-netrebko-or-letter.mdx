  For Ukrainians, the UK’s unwavering support – from its governments to its
  people and cultural institutions like the Royal Ballet and Opera – has been a
  vital source of strength and hope amid Russia’s brutal war of aggression. It
  is, therefore, with great pain that we witness the Royal Opera House inviting
  Anna Netrebko – a longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is
  responsible for serious war crimes – to return to its stage in title roles.
  Even more troubling is the statement by the chief executive of the Royal
  Ballet and Opera suggesting that its earlier support for Ukraine “was aligned
  with the global consensus at the time” and that its position has since changed
  due to “complex geopolitics”. We must ask: do Russia’s recent escalated
  attacks on peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilians and its intentional and
  systematic attempts to erase Ukrainian culture fall into this category of
  complexity, somehow justifying Netrebko’s return? Can the Royal Opera credibly
  claim neutrality and integrity while offering its stage to someone who, in
  2014, publicly waved the flag of “Novorossiya”, the Kremlin’s separatist
  project in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, parts of which remain under Russian
  military occupation? The Royal Opera now faces a defining choice: between
  status and responsibility, between profit and values, between silence and
  conscience. We urge you to remain, as you consistently have, on the ethical
  side of art – and of history. Sergiy Kyslytsya First deputy foreign minister
