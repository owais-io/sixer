  The Department of Justice has issued two subpoenas to Letitia James, the New
  York attorney general who has been repeatedly criticized by Donald Trump,
  according to reports. One of the cases relates to a civil fraud case brought
  by James’s office against Trump, which resulted in the president owing New
  York state $500m, the New York Times reported. The other case relates to the
  attorney general’s investigation into National Rifle Association (NRA), a
  rightwing gun lobbying group. Trump has repeatedly attacked James, calling her
  a “horrible, horrible human being” earlier this year. In May, federal
  prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into James, after the Trump
  administration alleged she may have falsified paperwork for properties she
  owns in Virginia and New York. NBC News reported that the government’s new
  cases are focused on whether James deprived Trump and the NRA’s legal rights
  in its civil lawsuits. The investigation will raise further concerns that
  Trump is using the legal system to pursue personal vendettas. Last month the
  justice department announced a new “strike force” to investigate
  unsubstantiated charges that Barack Obama and top officials conspired to hurt
  Trump’s 2016 campaign, as legal experts told the Guardian that the department
  is “being used as a personal weapon” by Trump. Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for
  James, told the Times that any investigation into Trump’s fraud case was “the
  most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the
  president’s political retribution campaign”. “Weaponizing the Department of
  Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on
  the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration,” Lowell
  said. “If prosecutors carry out this improper tactic and are genuinely
  interested in the truth, we are ready and waiting with facts and the law.” A
  spokesperson for James said: “We stand strongly behind our successful
  litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association,
  and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.” The Department of
  Justice declined to comment when reached by the Guardian.
