  The measles outbreak in Texas has officially ended, but as cases continue to
  be detected in other parts of the US state health experts are warning of the
  need to prepare for outbreaks in undervaccinated communities, especially as
  anti-vaccine beliefs are becoming more prominent during the Trump
  administration. So far this year, 1,356 confirmed measles cases, largely from
  32 outbreaks, have been reported across the US – compared with last year’s
  entire total of 285 cases and 16 outbreaks. While the Texas outbreak initially
  drove the case counts, other US outbreaks are now contributing in increasing
  numbers. To prepare for new and expanding outbreaks, health officials will
  need more detailed breakdowns of which counties and communities have low
  vaccination rates and prepare for discreet but accessible vaccination
  campaigns and community-led education efforts. And when outbreaks hit, public
  health officials need the resources to mount effective responses quickly. “You
  need to launch a catch-up vaccination campaign and explain why measles is a
  serious illness,” said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical
  Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “And then provide vaccine access by
  creating catch-up vaccination clinics.” Going door to door or running smaller
  clinics might be more effective to vaccinate some hesitant communities, said
  Katherine Wells, Lubbock’s director of public health. “I think people would
  have been more likely to go into smaller or more neighborhood-level places,”
  she said of the Texas outbreak. When children first appeared at the hospital
  in Lubbock with telltale rashes and respiratory symptoms, doctors moved
  quickly to run tests and notify Wells of potential measles cases. Wells wanted
  to understand exactly how public health officials had contained measles
  outbreaks in the past, especially among communities similar to those of the
  Mennonite patients they were seeing initially in the outbreak. Immediately,
  she hit a snag: the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
  normally a central resource for officials battling outbreaks like these, had
  been placed under a gag order by new Trump administration officials. Instead,
  Wells turned to the literature, reading everything she could find. She was
  familiar with the 2018-19 outbreak in New York City’s Orthodox Jewish
  communities, but it was an earlier episode that really caught her eye: a 2014
  outbreak among Mennonites in Ohio. She sent an article about the Ohio outbreak
  to Zach Holbrooks, head of the public health department covering Gaines
  county, where the outbreak was centered. “It seemed very similar to the
  culture of who we were working with in Gaines county,” Wells said. They spent
  the weekend “trying to figure out what we needed to do” before the cases were
  confirmed and announced to the public. It took four months to quell the 2014
  Ohio outbreak. The handful of cases pointing to a growing outbreak in Texas
  were unlikely to be resolved in a week or two, Wells said. “So we needed to
  make sure we were planning for the long term.” They set up mass vaccination
  clinics, which were frequented more in Lubbock than in Gaines county. “I think
  there’s some stigma about getting vaccines,” Wells said – especially in highly
  visible places where news media tended to camp out. Yet vaccinations had
  worked well in Ohio to stop the outbreak. “I think they were able to do more
  going door to door and setting up smaller vaccination clinics and providing
  that education. We didn’t have the staffing available to us to do some of
  that,” Wells said. There is no cure for measles, but two doses of the measles,
  mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the illness. In
  hesitant communities, though, it can be difficult to strike the right balance
  in talking about vaccines without alienating patients. “Yes, vaccines are the
  way to get us out of it, but when you’re working with a community that’s not
  hearing that, you need to find other messages” to help protect the community,
  Wells said. Officials in Texas put out information – about isolation and
  quarantine to help slow down the spread, and about seeking care at the
  hospital. “There were concerns about people just staying away from the
  hospital because of fear that they might do something wrong for their child,”
  Wells said. They worked to get the message to parents: “If your child is
  really struggling [with] breathing, don’t delay – bring them into a hospital.”
  Wells wishes they had also created free treatment centers to provide medical
  support for families. “In hindsight, we probably could have taken some local
  doctors and nurse practitioners and set up some kind of clinic for people to
  come to if their child was really sick, where we could check their oxygen
  level, talk about what can we do to keep the child from getting dehydrated,
  and assess whether or not a child needed to go into the hospital,” Wells said.
  “We probably should have offered that service to the community at a free
  clinic, so that they also had a place to ask questions and get answers.”
  Instead, patients saw private medical providers – at least one of whom, Dr Ben
  Edwards, gained notoriety for his anti-vaccine views and treatments without an
  evidence base for measles. “Unfortunately, what you have now is a very corrupt
  health and wellness influencer industry that is pushing interventions like
  that as an alternative to vaccination, and that’s not how it works,” said
  Hotez. Responding to people’s questions about vaccines takes time and requires
  “real conversations” to understand and address their concerns, Wells said.
  “It’s a slow process. It’s going to take some of these one-on-one
  conversations – and then hopefully, if you change their mind, they’re going to
  be able to advocate to their friends and to the people they’re in contact
  with.” At the same time, Wells said, “we also need to make sure vaccines are
  easily available – not putting up barriers for people to get vaccinated when
  they want to”. In the west Texas outbreak, Wells also suggested assembling
  teams of community health workers to educate their neighbors and encourage
  vaccination. But they didn’t have the money and time to do that, she said.
  Local health officials are well-suited to build relationships like these
  before crisis strikes. “You need to have those relationships in place to work
  through whenever there’s a big pandemic or some kind of outbreak,” she said.
  It’s a plan that helped with the Covid pandemic in Lubbock – identifying
  community leaders, including in churches, to create a “vaccine ambassador
  program” of lay people who helped others make vaccination appointments and
  arrange transportation, Wells said. Officials could also gather information
  about vaccination rates at the local level to predict in which areas and
  communities outbreaks may take root, Hotez said. “The problem that we have is
  the CDC does not track any childhood immunization rates at the county level,”
  Hotez said. “They only do state and national immunization levels, which is not
  adequate, because of the way measles operates – it strikes clusters in
  counties with really low vaccination rates.” To combat measles on the national
  level, the CDC could create a vaccination map of the country to understand
  where vulnerable pockets exist and begin health education campaigns tailored
  to those areas. Hotez co-authored a study in 2018 creating a map like this
  based on information from state health departments. “It was pretty shocking
  when we saw these big patches of the country where kids were not getting
  vaccinated, and it was missed by the CDC because they were only looking at
  statewide immunization rates,” he said. Idaho, for example, is at high risk
  for a widespread measles epidemic, Hotez said. “The whole state of Idaho looks
  like the same vaccination rates as those pockets in west Texas. So the
  vulnerability remains.” Last Tuesday, Idaho announced two measles cases in
  areas that hadn’t seen the disease in three decades. Both children were
  unvaccinated.
