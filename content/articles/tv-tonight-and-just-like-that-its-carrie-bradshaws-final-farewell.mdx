  And Just Like That 9pm, Sky Comedy Sex and the City fans were left in a state
  of shock and confusion when showrunner Michael Patrick King announced that the
  spin-off’s season three finale would be the last-ever episode: “It’s a
  wonderful place to stop,” he said. Sure – it has been an excruciating watch,
  plagued by terrible writing and narrative decisions (see: Seema’s natural
  deodorant episode). But these are our girls! What a joy it has been to dissect
  their choices and relationships with our own mates every week. Who will we
  lovingly bitch about now? Here’s hoping that they get the send-off they
  deserve. And if Carrie stays single in the city, well, that would be just
  fabulous. Hollie Richardson Our Lives: Row Hard Or Row Home – Around Ireland
  in 32 Days 7.30pm, BBC One Last year, four Irishmen sailed into the Guinness
  World Records for rowing pretty much nonstop around Ireland in a small boat,
  unsupported and powered only by two-hour rowing shifts. Self-shot over those
  32 days, this compelling documentary captures the feat, sea sickness, extreme
  weather, sleep deprivation and all. Ali Catterall Lost in the Desert With Nick
  Knowles 9pm, Channel 5 Kudos to Knowlesy’s agent: these days you’re as likely
  to see him gallivanting across the world as you are to see him picking up a
  screwdriver on a DIY show. His latest jaunt, to the Gobi desert, probably
  won’t have Joanna Lumley’s people in a cold sweat. It’s pretty entertaining,
  though – not least when he tries a spot of mounted archery. Hannah J Davies
  Here We Go 9pm, BBC One Tom Basden’s sitcom bumbles along cheerfully, its
  amiability belying the density of the writing. It never feels like essential
  viewing but slips down incredibly easily all the same. In this episode, the
  family become concerned about Sue’s bingo habit. Phil Harrison Under the
  Bridge 9pm, ITV1 The compelling true-crime drama based on the 1997 murder of
  Reena Virk in British Columbia continues. The journalist sleuth Rebecca (Riley
  Keough) is making progress with the case but her methods are becoming
  increasingly wayward. Surely dropping acid with a teenage boy is not the best
  way to get a new lead? Graeme Virtue Whitstable Pearl 9pm, U&amp;Drama Pearl’s
  next case is personal this week, as when she calls her son Charlie – who is
  meant to be in Canada – she hears the UK ringtone and tracks his mobile phone
  to London. Has something terrible happened … or are her family just keeping
  secrets? HR Film choice Roxanne (Fred Schepisi, 1987), 6pm, Sky Cinema Greats
  This 1987 romantic comedy is Steve Martin in his cinematic prime, melding
  physical humour and dramatic purpose to beguiling effect. His own adaptation
  of Cyrano de Bergerac transposes the action to a small US town, where the fire
  chief CD (Martin) has a very, very long nose but is a whip-smart, outgoing
  local personality. Daryl Hannah plays the titular love interest, an astronomy
  student who admires the looks of Rick Rossovich’s nice-but-dim firefighter
  Chris but really likes the eloquent words CD puts into his courting
  colleague’s mouth. Simon Wardell Live sport Premier League football: Liverpool
  v Bournemouth, 6.30pm, Sky Sports Main Event Virgil van Dijk leads the league
  title holders as the new season kicks off at Anfield.
