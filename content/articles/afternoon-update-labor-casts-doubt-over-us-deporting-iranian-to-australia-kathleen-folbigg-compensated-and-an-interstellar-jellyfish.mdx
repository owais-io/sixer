  Good afternoon. The Albanese government has said it has no knowledge of the
  Trump administration’s plan to deport an Iranian-born man from US immigration
  detention to Australia, despite him having no link to the country. Reza
  Zavvar, a 52-year-old permanent US resident who arrived when he was 12, is
  being held in detention near his Maryland home due to a historical conviction
  for marijuana possession which dates back to the 1990s. While Zavvar cannot be
  sent back to Iran due to risk of persecution, documents provided by US
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement suggest he could be sent to Australia or
  Romania. A spokesperson for the Albanese government said there was no new
  agreement for transfer of US immigration detainees to Australia and it had not
  been approached by the Trump administration in relation to Zavvar’s case. Top
  news Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward argues it would be unfair to be expelled

  people on a 250-year journey to a habitable planet. What they said … *** “It
