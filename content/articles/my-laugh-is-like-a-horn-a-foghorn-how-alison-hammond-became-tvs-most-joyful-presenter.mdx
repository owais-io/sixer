  All Alison Hammond wants is to “bring happiness and spread joy”. She’s so
  devoted to this mission she even did it straight after the death, five years
  ago, of her beloved mother Maria. “My mum died in hospital at 5.30am,” she
  recalls. “At 6am, I went out to my car and this woman stopped me for a selfie.
  I said sure, no problem. I knew it would make her happy, so I hid behind my
  own smile. Little did she know my mum had just died but looking back, oh my
  God – I’ll always remember it.” The 50-year-old Brummie whirlwind loves to
  make someone’s day. At her local supermarket recently, she met a fan called
  Kate who’d just lost her own mother. “I’ll never forget how hard it was when
  my mum passed, so I invited Kate to the Bake Off final. She met Paul Hollywood
  and he gave her a handshake. She said it was the best day of her life. It
  doesn’t take a lot, does it? Kindness truly does make a difference.” Hammond’s
  high-wattage enthusiasm and infectious humour have won her a devoted following
  but she’s fully aware that hers can be a divisive screen presence. “Not
  everyone likes me. Look, I’ll show you a video that tickled me.” She plays a
  TikTok of a woman grumbling about her joining the cast of Celebrity Gogglebox.
  “Give somebody else a chance, love,” she rants. “We’re sick of the bloody
  sight of you.” “I like these, because they humble me,” says Hammond. “They
  remind me I’m not all that. She hates my guts but that’s all right. People say
  Pete Wicks would be better than me at presenting For the Love of Dogs. He
  might be but I’m doing it. Deal with it! I know my worth. Besides, my mum
  would have been so proud. That’s the reason I do this. She’s my guiding
  light.” TikTok trolls haven’t dimmed Hammond’s glow. Perched on a chaise
  longue after a long day of Great British Bake Off promotional duties, she
  exudes energy and warmth. When people wander past – including her
  partner-in-cake Noel Fielding, sporting a skull jumper – she involves them in
  our conversation. She shows me gossipy messages on her phone. That trademark
  laugh peals out regularly. “I don’t think I laugh that loudly, then I hear
  myself on telly and think: what do I sound like? It’s like a horn. A literal
  foghorn.” At which point it peals out again. We’re meeting to discuss Bake
  Off’s imminent 16th series and Hammond’s third as co-host. “I still see myself
  as the new girl,” she says. “Paul has been there from the start, obviously.
  Noel and Prue [Leith] have been there for nine years. So I’m still the newbie
  and they’re still bullying me. Only joking. I bully them too, to be fair,
  especially Paul. I take him to task for being mean to the bakers. He’s dead
  stingy with the handshakes this year. Even I haven’t had a Hollywood handshake
  in real life. He’s funny about them. That handshake is worth a lot. His hands
  are probably insured for millions!” This year’s batch of 12 amateur bakers are
  a typically diverse bunch: “We’ve got the whole spectrum, from age 23 to 59.
  There’s an engineer, a hairdresser, a medical student, a wedding dress
  designer. But the one common denominator is that baking is everything to
  them.” Hammond has genuine empathy for them because she’s seen both sides of
  the reality TV experience. “I was a contestant on Big Brother, in the jungle,
  even on Celebrity Bake Off,” she nods. “I know what they’re going through.
  There’s one baker who can’t even make caramel but they learn on the job and do
  brilliantly. I love watching them progress. They go into the tent as one
  person and come out as another. You can’t help being emotionally involved.
  What often moves me is hearing about who they’ve left behind to take part.
  Some have kids. They’re not seeing their babies because they’re working so
  hard at this. You’re willing them to do well. When they leave, you find a lump
  in your throat.” Last year, Hammond took a hilarious tumble off a workbench.
  Any pratfalls to look forward to this time? “Loads. It’s me you’re talking to.
  I’m always awkward and clumsy. Hopefully they’ll edit out the mishaps, but
  knowing our team, they’ll leave them in.” Things go awry for the bakers too.
  “A technical challenge goes disastrously wrong and it’s one of the funniest
  things I’ve ever seen. Even the bakers see the funny side. Well, eventually.”
  Asked for behind-the-scenes titbits, she grins: “We’ve all got our own
  deckchairs now. We’ve put them outside our little shepherd’s hut trailers, so
  we can sit there and chat. Hopefully next year, we’ll get a jacuzzi.” There
  was plenty of whizzing around the Welford Park grounds in golf buggies. “Noel
  doesn’t have a driving licence so he’s obsessed. That’s his time to be a
  driver. He was extra lucky this year: for his birthday, Paul bought him the
  car that Noel’s dad had when he was a kid. This beautiful three-wheeler. Now
  he has to pass his test or it’ll be embarrassing. Someone’s bought you a car
  and you can’t drive it? Bit rude. I made a point of telling Paul that my dad
  drove a Mercedes, so next birthday, you never know. Fingers crossed!”
  Hammond’s weight loss has become a tabloid obsession. She shed an impressive
  11st, thanks to healthy eating and weight training, and looks fabulous in a
  shimmery olive jumpsuit. How much scoffing of bakes does she do? “I tried to
  hold back but I still put on 2kg this series. When I see a handshake, I’ve got
  to try it. I always taste the winning technical and best showstopper.” Is she
  still weightlifting? “I am but I’ve not had time lately. I hadn’t been to the
  gym for ages but I went back yesterday and, babes, I think I pulled a muscle.
  I was like, I’m getting too old for this.” Surely she gets free massages from
  boyfriend David Putman – a masseur who (cue another tabloid fixation) is 23
  years her junior? “It was better when I used to pay for them,” she chuckles.
  “I don’t get jack shit no more. He does everyone else but me!” This spring,
  Hammond finally landed her own interview series, Alison Hammond’s Big Weekend
  on BBC One, in which she spent a weekend at the homes of her famous guests. “I
  adored it,” she says. “Just holding that space for people to talk. It caught
  me offguard, some stuff they told me. It was lovely that they felt comfortable
  enough to open up. Perrie Edwards discussing her struggles with anxiety was
  really powerful. So was Mel B talking about being a survivor of domestic
  abuse.” Comedian Jimmy Carr – when he wasn’t teasing Hammond about her
  pronunciation of “skeleton” (“I still don’t know what I’m saying wrong,” she
  laughs. “It’s skellington, isn’t it?”) – spoke movingly about seeing his late
  mother in his own son. I wonder if Hammond feels the same about her
  20-year-old son, Aidan. “Without a doubt. Aidan’s exactly like her, right down
  to the way he eats and how he’s strict about home security. He tells me off if
  I haven’t locked the porch, which was exactly what my mum did. It’s like she
  came back in my son.” A second series of Big Weekend hasn’t yet been announced
  (come on, BBC) but who’d be her dream guests? “Kylie, definitely. Madonna?
  Oprah? Let’s aim high and see what happens.” Hammond has plenty to keep her
  busy in the meantime. Every Friday, she co-presents This Morning with Dermot
  O’Leary. It’s invariably the best episode of the week. Would she fancy doing
  the other four days? “Nope,” she says firmly. “I live in Birmingham and
  spending all my time in London would be too much. Cat [Deeley] and Ben
  [Shephard, the main hosts] are incredible. Anyway, I like being the Friday
  guy. The weekend’s coming, let’s have some fun.” Last year, she had the
  unenviable task of taking over ITV’s For the Love Of Dogs after the death of
  longtime host Paul O’Grady. “I never tried to fill Paul’s shoes. Those shoes
  are well and truly filled. Mine are a totally different pair. I can see why he
  did the job for so long. It’s bloody lovely. Being with dogs is like therapy.”
  She inherited her ferocious work ethic from Maria. “Mum was a proper grafter
  and I am too. I’m a single parent like she was. She understood what that’s
  like and helped me so much. With every success comes sacrifice. I wasn’t
  always around for Aidan but she was. We called her his second mum. When Aidan
  was little, I made a rule that I’d only work three days a week, no more, so I
  could be there for him. Now he’s older, it’s more flexible.” Does she worry
  about becoming overexposed? “No. If I need to rest up or a job doesn’t appeal,
  I won’t do it. I’m good at saying no. I turn down 10 things per day, no
  exaggeration. It looks like I’m on TV a lot, sure, but I stand out partly
  because it’s still not the norm to see a Black woman doing this. I don’t want
  to bring race into it but no one says that about Davina or Ant and Dec. I’ve
  worked hard for 22 years to get here. That woman on TikTok is allowed her
  opinion. It keeps me grounded. I’m not a national treasure. I’m just me, doing
  a job that I adore to the best of my ability, trying to be better than I was
  yesterday.” That 22-year journey began on Big Brother. In the reality
  trailblazer’s third series, housemate Hammond memorably jumped on a garden
  table and broke it. Behold, a TV career was launched. “Wow, what a time. The
  maddest thing is, I was only in there for 14 days but it was life-changing.
  I’m eternally grateful to Big Brother. If it wasn’t for that show and breaking
  that table, I wouldn’t be doing what I love now. And I never did pay for the
  damage.” Next in the pipeline is new Channel 4 format Your Song, which has
  been dubbed “The Piano for singing”. “I’d forgotten about that show!” she
  cackles. “God, I really am everywhere, aren’t I? It’s people singing who
  probably never planned to. Everyday people with a connection to a particular
  song.” She scoffs at any notion of a career plan. “I just do what makes me
  happy, and I do it with grace and love. I’m 50 now. I only want joy in my
  life. What links all the shows I do is people and joy. I enjoy talking to the
  public because I am the public. I’m normal too. I just happen to laugh like a
  horn.” The Great British Bake Off returns on 2 September at 8pm on Channel 4.
