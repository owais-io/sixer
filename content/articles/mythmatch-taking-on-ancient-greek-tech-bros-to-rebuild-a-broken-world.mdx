  One of the most interesting trends in game design is the use of familiar
  mechanics and genres to explore real-world power systems and how to challenge
  them. Forthcoming deck-building game, All Will Rise, seeks to interest players
  in political activism, Compensation Not Guaranteed aims to educate players
  about south-east Asian politics, while MythMatch is ostensibly a puzzle game
  set in ancient Greece, but is also about building communities and challenging
  capitalism – while still looking cute and approachable. You play as Artemis,
  the goddess of the hunt, who is having to navigate the institutionalised
  sexism of Mount Olympus, here represented as a corporation infested with tech
  bros. In defiance, she decides to help the mortals of Ithaca build a new, more
  progressive world – and you do this by running around the little environments,
  merging items and animals to create helpful new beasts and objects. For
  example, when you’re cast down to Earth you accidentally smash a chariot
  belonging to Selene, the goddess of the Moon, so you have to match moon shards
  together to recreate the celestial vehicle. However, one of the shards has
  fallen into a greenhouse, so you need to solve a puzzle to gain access. The
  game then is part narrative adventure, part social sim, part match-three
  teaser. “We ended up taking a lot more from automation games like Factorio,
  but where the automation happens through connection with the NPCs rather than
  building machinery,” says Moo Yu, founder and creative director at developer
  Team Artichoke. “And in Mount Olympus, we’re inspired by various arcade-style
  games like Money Puzzle Exchanger, Overcooked, and even Super Auto Pets.” With
  a diverse bunch of characters and a genuinely funny script, the emphasis is
  very much on forming friendships and a pleasant community. “I became obsessed
  with the theme of belonging,” says Yu. “As someone who has always struggled to
  make friends or find community, I just felt like there weren’t enough games
  about rejection and found family. So I started with some gameplay about moving
  goalposts and constantly being rejected by the gods of Olympus. Then when
  searching for where Artemis might actually fit in, I thought about some of the
  communities that I love and how they are about aligning our commonalities
  while embracing our differences.” Team Artichoke is a small studio with 10
  staff, most of whom are working part-time on the project. At the helm, Yu is a
  veteran who’s worked at Media Molecule and Mind Candy as well as co-developing
  the hit adventure Knights and Bikes. When asked about the key influences
  behind Mythmatch, he immediately cites three films: Kung Fu Panda, Amelie and
  most prominently Legally Blonde, the Reese Witherspoon comedy which is
  visually coded to look like a romcom but also deftly analyses misogyny in the
  legal profession. “We wanted to create a caricatured world to give us the
  breathing space to venture on to more serious topics,” he says. “[There’s] a
  surface cuteness but with a layer of grittiness throughout. So while the game
  might not literally look like the world of Legally Blonde, we wanted to
  capture the space created by the exaggerated colour palette while also making
  sure there was a layer of messiness as well.” So while Mythmatch uses the core
  game loops of casual genres such as match-three and merge games, it has a
  fundamental message to impart about power and belonging. Yu sees this
  combination as important in the indie games scene of 2025. “I’m seeing more
  small games that are delivering new stories or pairing mechanics with
  interesting narratives that I think speaks to what creativity can accomplish
  with limited funds,” he says. “I wish the funds weren’t getting more and more
  limited, but I am always inspired by what people can accomplish with what they
  can scrape together.” • Mythmatch is currently in development for PC, with a
  release date to be announced.
