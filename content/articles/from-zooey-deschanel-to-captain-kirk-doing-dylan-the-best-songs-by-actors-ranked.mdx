  20. Dennis Parker – Like an Eagle (1979) It perhaps stretches the definition
  of “actor”: Parker starred in a soap opera, but was better known as
  pornographic actor Wade Nichols. However, Like an Eagle is incredible, a
  soaring, euphoric mid-tempo disco epic produced by his then-partner, Jacques
  Morali – and infinitely cooler than Morali’s biggest successes with Village
  People – so let’s bend the rules. 19. William Shatner – Mr Tambourine Man
  (1968) Captain Kirk’s debut album raises questions: are its hysterical
  recitations of pop hits and Shakespeare soliloquies meant to be funny or a
  wildly misguided attempt at out-there art? They sound nuts either way. Later
  albums, where Shatner is audibly in on the joke, are somehow less fun; they’re
  certainly less disturbing. 18. Scarlett Johansson – Song for Jo (2008)
  Produced by TV on the Radio’s Dave Sitek, Johansson’s debut album was heavy on
  Tom Waits covers and featured a cameo from David Bowie. It received a mixed
  response. As this self-penned song proves, it’s pretty good, its dark, foggy
  atmospherics suggesting a love of This Mortal Coil. 17. Wicked Wisdom – Bleed
  All Over Me (2006) If you want evidence of where Willow Smith’s eclectic
  musical taste came from, her mother Jada’s penchant for nu-metal seems a good
  place to start. Bleed All Over Me is great: the guitars rage, former Fishbone
  drummer Philip Fisher adds a swing, and Jada Pinkett Smith’s vocals are really
  powerful. 16. Anna Karina – Roller Girl (1967) The queen of the nouvelle vague
  sang in Godard’s Une Femme Est une Femme but recorded only intermittently: in
  her 70s, she worked with Giant Sand’s Howe Gelb. The pick of her oeuvre is the
  raw, gleeful garage rock of Roller Girl, the first – but not last – credit for
  songwriter Serge Gainsbourg in this list. 15. She &amp; Him – In the Sun
  (2010) Some of Zooey Deschanel’s indie-rock collaborations with M Ward as She
  &amp; Him are a little too sugary for their own good. But the lead single from
  their second album, Volume Two, hits the mark: a melding of smooth 70s soft
  rock and jazzy pre-rock’n’roll pop that’s as warm and lovely as its title
  suggests. 14. Sophie Thatcher – Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door (2024) The star of
  Yellowjackets released a debut EP of experimental pop last year. This, her
  follow-up, was her intriguing contribution to the soundtrack of the horror
  film Heretic, a hazy cover of the Bob Dylan classic set to the melody – and
  the mood – of Mazzy Star’s Fade Into You. It fits with the film, but works
  perfectly in its own right. 13. David Hemmings – Back Street Mirror (1967) The
  Blow Up star’s debut album, David Hemmings Happens, is impressively
  star-studded: he is backed by various members of the Byrds and legendary LA
  session players the Wrecking Crew for a collection of improvised jazzy
  psychedelia and baroque folk-rock. Its real classic is this otherwise
  unreleased song by former Byrd Gene Clark: a world-weary minor masterpiece.
  12. Tracey Ullman – They Don’t Know (1983) Why They Don’t Know was not a hit
  for its composer, Kirsty MacColl, is an enduring mystery: apparently written
  when she was 16, it’s a dizzyingly perfect pop song. It finally made the UK
  and US Top 10 thanks to Ullman’s brief sojourn as a pop singer, helping to
  kickstart her wildly successful career in the US. 11. Jane Birkin – Encore Lui
  (1973) There was far more to Jane Birkin’s singing career than the
  heavy-breathing scandal of Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus: her 70s albums are
  particularly fine examples of leftfield francophone pop. From her solo debut
  album, Di Doo Dah, Encore Lui is understated, fabulously orchestrated and
  supremely cool. 10. Lace Manhattan – In the Sun She Lies (2025) Margaret
  Qualley certainly isn’t the only US actor to pursue a parallel career in
  acoustic alt-rock, but In the Sun She Lies – produced by her husband, Jack
  Antonoff, for a new Ethan Coen film called Honey Don’t! – is impressively,
  naggingly odd: swathed in spooky echo, backed by the sound of gusting winds
  and abstract guitar noise, occasionally dying away entirely. 9. Sam Morton –
  Let’s Walk in the Night (2024) Samantha Morton’s collaborative album with
  producer and XL Recordings boss Richard Russell, Daffodils &amp; Dirt, was a
  leftfield delight: its moody brand of trip-hop revivalism is perfectly
  encapsulated by the darkly seductive, distinctly nocturnal pop of Let’s Walk
  in the Night, the jazzy sax provided by Alabaster DePlume. 8. Matt Berry –
  Take My Hand (2009) Matt Berry is an astonishingly prolific musician, turning
  out everything from proggy folk to ambient synth instrumentals to country
  rock. Take My Hand is particularly fantastic: melodic, soft-focus psychedelia
  with a hint of Elton John’s Song for Guy in its DNA, it’s also the theme to
  Toast of London. 7. Jamie Foxx – I Don’t Need It (2008) Foxx’s singing career
  has yielded deeply variable results: you need a strong stomach to cope with
  him in priapic loverman mode, and his biggest success involved impersonating
  Ray Charles on Kanye West’s Gold Digger. I Don’t Need It, though, is great:
  tough, Timbaland-produced 21st-century funk. 6. Dead Man’s Bones – Pa Pa Power
  (2009) Ryan Gosling and Zach Shields’ solitary album as Dead Man’s Bones is a
  curious thing: ghost-themed gothic alt-rock featuring a children’s choir on
  every track. But it contained one unequivocal triumph: Pa Pa Power is creepy
  and compelling, and was subsequently covered by Cat Power to striking effect.
  5. Eighth Wonder – I’m Not Scared (1988) Patsy Kensit had been an actor since
  childhood, but a parallel career as a pop star stubbornly refused to take off.
  Her band Eighth Wonder couldn’t get a hit until Pet Shop Boys gave them the
  haunting Europop-influenced I’m Not Scared. Success proved fleeting, but at
  least they left behind one fabulous single. 4. Brigitte Bardot – Bonnie and
  Clyde (1968) Brigitte Bardot may have been an icon of French cinema, but she
  was no great shakes as a singer. It scarcely mattered once a lovestruck Serge
  Gainsbourg started turning out extraordinary songs for her. Bonnie and Clyde
  makes a virtue of her limited range: her voice sounds like the epitome of cool
  hauteur. 3. John Leyton – Johnny Remember Me (1961) Feverish, cinematic and
  eerie, Johnny Remember Me is one of the masterpieces of pre-Beatles British
  pop, showcasing the late Joe Meek’s genius as a producer. It was helped to No
  1 by John Leyton’s role in the TV series Harpers West One when a performance
  of the song was somehow worked into the plot. 2. Richard Harris – MacArthur
  Park (1968) Harris’s late 60s collaborations with songwriter Jimmy Webb are
  extraordinary: lavish, lush, adventurous examples of post-Sgt Pepper
  experimental pop. The episodic MacArthur Park is more than seven minutes long,
  mystifying but utterly gripping and furthermore, a huge hit. Harris may not be
  the greatest singer, but he’s a captivating presence here. 1. Childish Gambino
  – This Is America (2018) Most actors’ singing careers are an adjunct to their
  main gig: they might produce hits, but they seldom produce anything that
  garners a response like This Is America. A lot of attention was understandably
  directed at the choreographed violence of its extraordinary video, but the
  track doesn’t need visual accompaniment to strike home: trap beats and sweet
  choral vocals, a performance by Glover that switches from austere rapping to
  gentle singing, cameos from rappers including 21 Savage and Quavo, lyrics that
  explore systemic racism and gun violence. Not for nothing did it win song of
  the year at the Grammys.
