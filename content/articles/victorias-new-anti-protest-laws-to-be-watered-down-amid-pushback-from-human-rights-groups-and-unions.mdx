  Proposed anti-protest laws in Victoria – including an outright ban on face
  masks at protests – will be significantly scaled back after pushback by human
  rights groups and unions. Several sources involved in the consultation
  process, some of whom have requested anonymity as the bill’s wording is not
  finalised, have said that roundtable discussions in April prompted concessions
  from the Allan government. This included dropping plans for a full ban on
  “face coverings” at protests, which was planned to carry a fine of up to
  $2,000. Instead, it is understood the government will propose penalties only
  when a person wearing a face covering is refusing to cooperate with police or
  believed to be committing a criminal act. A senior Victorian government source
  said such a measure, combined with anti-vilification laws set to take effect
  in September, would allow authorities to “unmask” neo-Nazis, who marched
  through Melbourne’s CBD in face coverings at the weekend. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email Anastasia Radievska, protest rights campaigner at the Australian
  Democracy Network, said the shift was the result of “broad opposition” to the
  plan, including by human rights, legal, faith, First Nations and disability
  rights groups. “The prohibition on masks has serious impacts on community
  health, the participation of people with disabilities, the participation of
  victim-survivors of domestic and sexual violence in protest. It’s not an
  appropriate way to address the problems of racist violence, which is what the
  laws were advertised as tackling,” Radievska said. “These groups have worked
  to ensure that any restrictions that are introduced – although we’ve argued
  that Victoria doesn’t need new protest restrictions – are appropriately
  targeted and don’t impact on the participation of these vulnerable groups in
  protests, and actually target radicalised violence and hate.” An outright ban
  on attachment devices such as chains, glue or locks, which are commonly used
  in climate protests, is also expected to be narrowed and will apply only when
  there is a community safety risk. This would mean non-violent acts such as
  those committed by Zelda D’Aprano – who is immortalised in bronze outside
  Trades Hall after she chained herself to a government building to protest
  against the lack of equal pay for women – wouldn’t be affected. The proposal
  for “safe access” areas around places of worship, which was also floated by
  the government in December, has been described by several stakeholders as
  “dead in the water”. But this was disputed by the government source who said
  it was still being considered, though was proving “incredibly complex”.
  However, a ban on the display of terrorist symbols at protests is likely to
  proceed, despite reservations about how “terrorist organisation” could be
  defined. Stakeholders were initially told the changes would be introduced when
  parliament resumed after the midwinter break but the timeline has now shifted
  to the end of the year. The premier, Jacinta Allan, told reporters on Tuesday
  the laws would not be aimed at protests but at extremist behaviour. “People
  who are taking the opportunity to engage in extreme and dangerous behaviour
  under the guise of participating in a protest – that’s what the new laws will
  be cracking down on,” she said. It comes after Labor’s rank and file members
  carried a motion at state conference earlier this month calling on the
  government to abandon its proposed changes. “Inconvenience is not a form of
  violence,” it said, noting several wins of the labour movement were only
  possible as a result. Victoria’s new police chief, Mike Bush, also ruled out a
  permit system for protests in a series of interviews last month, as he said
  they had not been effective in other states. But this didn’t stop the
  Coalition opposition from attempting to introduce a bill to parliament on
  Wednesday to establish a protest registration system as well as a ban on face
  coverings and stronger move-on laws. The opposition’s police spokesperson,
  David Southwick, accused the government of being “all talk and no action” when
  it came to introducing tougher protest laws. “We need tougher laws and
  consequences,” he said. “We can’t wait till the end of the year. That’s just
  ridiculous.” The Greens leader, Ellen Sandell, however, welcomed the
  government’s shift. She said Labor had “really misread the Victorian public”
  when it announced the “draconian laws” last year. “The Victorian people don’t
  want to see the Victorian Labor government go down the path of Trump’s America
  or even the New South Wales government that are trying to crack down on the
  fundamental right to peaceful protest,” Sandell said.
