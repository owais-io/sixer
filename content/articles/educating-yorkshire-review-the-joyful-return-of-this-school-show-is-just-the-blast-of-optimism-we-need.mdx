  Educating Yorkshire review – the joyful return of this school show is just the

  The trailer for the new series of Educating Yorkshire is a work of art. Shot
  in one take and clocking in at more than three minutes, it was written and
  performed by the children of Thornhill community academy in Dewsbury – in
  collaboration with Dougal Wilson, the director of Paddington in Peru – and
  takes in a school band, percussionist dinner ladies and a child seemingly
  being fired out of a cannon from the roof. It’s sweet and funny, but it’s
  pointed, too, in style and content. This hasn’t been a great year for the
  public profile of British secondary schools. The national orgy of
  hand-wringing prompted by Netflix’s superb Adolescence has led to something
  approaching despair at the state of education, entrenching the perception that
  overstretched and under-resourced teachers act as little more than crowd
  control, leaving children neurotic and dysfunctional, making them sitting
  ducks for malignant influencers such as Andrew Tate. This revival then, is
  perfectly timed. In the trailer, the one-take style showcases humour, variety
  and invention. The show itself suggests that while many things have changed
  since we last spent time at this school, in 2014, plenty more has stayed the
  same. Mr Burton – last seen movingly coaxing fluent speech out of a stammering
  pupil, Musharaf – is now Thornhill’s headteacher. Britain has had six prime
  ministers since 2014. Sometimes a slow but steady uphill trajectory is the
  most worthwhile path for a public servant to take. So who are our new
  Musharafs? The very clever and very disruptive Riley is certainly an early
  candidate. Might he have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? Or
  dyslexia? Or is his clowning, as Mrs Delaney-Hudson puts it euphemistically,
  “a behaviour choice”? He faces significant sanctions if his erratic modus
  operandi can’t be clinically explained. A neurodiversity screening doesn’t
  help. His mum is nonplussed. Maybe a food diary will offer some answers? The
  gentleness with which Riley is guided towards better habits is striking. As
  Mrs D-H puts it: “He absolutely thrives off the positivity.” Who doesn’t? Then
  there is Amy. “I’m just a mixture of random stuff, put together incorrectly,”
  she says. She is underselling herself considerably, of course. Amy is a
  thoroughly eccentric and entirely charming kid, grappling with Tourette
  syndrome and the absurd (but, at 12, deadly serious) micropolitics of
  schoolyard friendships. In a pastoral care session, she struggles to find a
  single good thing to say about herself. It can be stated with confidence that
  viewers will feel very differently. Amy is obsessed with the school’s hash
  browns and says quirky, funny things (“Why are your tights so holey? They’re
  like the Bible”). She is a star; as you watch, you can feel the country’s
  collective heart begin to melt. Amy’s trajectory illustrates the genius at the
  heart of this series. What an incredibly careful and delicately performed
  editing job is routinely done here: to make these children hilarious, but
  never the butt of the joke; to show their vulnerability, but also their
  strength; to render their triumphs and tragedies serious, but never
  overwhelming. It shows us the nuance and the nuts and bolts of their
  developing personalities, their muddled impulses and motivations, the gently
  irresistible force of their forming identities. The care of the film-makers
  echoes that of the teaching staff. When Amy has a mild falling out with her
  friend Millie, the student manager for year 8, Mr Wilson – who isn’t a teacher
  and is more like a benign big brother – simply brings them together in his
  office, puts his headphones on and lets them get on with setting their
  incredibly minor difference. “I don’t think I opened up to people when I was
  at school,” he reflects later. “But then I don’t know if there was anyone I
  could have opened up to.” This will chime with many viewers of a certain age
  who may wish things had been different in their day. There is something gently
  polemical going on here. Sadly, there will be people who observe this school,
  with its wellness hub and its positive reinforcement and its atmosphere of
  listening, rather than shouting, and decry it as “woke”. What happened to the
  stiff upper lip? To discipline? To “spare the rod and spoil the child”?
  Educating Yorkshire reinforces something quite different. Things have changed.
  These children are given tailored, individual pastoral care. They will be
  better adults for it. For viewers in search of confirmation for their biases,
  clouds will certainly gather in later episodes. Smartphones will be discussed;
  social media, too. But initially, at least, solutions are hard-earned, but
  relatively simple. Is Educating Yorkshire rose-tinted? Probably. Is it filmed
  and edited to show everyone involved in as positive a light as possible?
  Almost certainly. Does it feel like a necessary blast of optimism? You bet it
  does. • Educating Yorkshire is on Channel 4
