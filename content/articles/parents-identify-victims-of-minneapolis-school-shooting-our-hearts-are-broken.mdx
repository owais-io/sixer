  An eight-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl who were killed in a mass
  shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school have been identified by their
  parents. Fletcher Merkel, eight, and Harper Moyski, 10, died during the attack
  on the Annunciation Catholic school church on Wednesday morning, their parents
  confirmed. A further 17 people, 14 of them children, were injured in the
  shooting. “Yesterday, a coward decided to take our eight-year-old son,
  Fletcher, away from us,” Jesse Merkel said outside the school on Thursday, of
  the attack that police say was perpetrated by a 23-year-old former student who
  then killed themself after the shooting. “Because of their actions, we will
  never be allowed to hold him, talk to him, play with him, and watch him grow
  into the wonderful young man he was on the path to becoming.” Jesse Merkel
  said that Fletcher loved his family, friends, fishing, cooking and “any sport
  he was allowed to play”. He added: “While the hole in our hearts and lives
  will never be filled, I hope that in time, our family can find healing. I pray
  that the other victim’s family can find some semblance of the same.” Harper
  Moyski’s parents also released a statement, remembering their daughter as a
  “bright, joyful, and deeply loved 10-year-old whose laughter, kindness, and
  spirit touched everyone who knew her.” “Our hearts are broken not only as
  parents, but also for Harper’s sister, who adored her big sister and is
  grieving an unimaginable loss,” Harper’s parents, Michael Moyski and Jackie
  Flavin, said in a statement to ABC Minneapolis station KSTP. “As a family, we
  are shattered, and words cannot capture the depth of our pain.” Harper’s
  parents added that no other family should have to endure what they have. “We
  urge our leaders and communities to take meaningful steps to address gun
  violence and the mental health crisis in this country,” they said. “Change is
  possible, and it is necessary – so that Harper’s story does not become yet
  another in a long line of tragedies.” The shooting took place during a mass
  that marked the first week of school. Police said the suspected perpetrator,
  Robin Westman, fired into the church from outside, through the windows. The
  doors of the church were locked during the service, which probably saved
  “countless lives”, according to investigators. An exact motive for the
  shooting is still unclear. However, police and investigators said Westman had
  a “deranged fascination” with mass shooters and was obsessed with the idea of
  killing children. In a news conference on Thursday, Joseph Thompson, the
  acting US attorney general for Minnesota and a recent appointee of Trump, said
  that in writings left behind, “the shooter expressed hate towards many groups,
  including the Jewish community and towards President Trump.” “I won’t dignify
  the attacker’s words by repeating them, they are horrific and vile,” Thompson
  added. The attack has again reignited calls for stricter controls upon guns,
  particularly assault weapons, that enable the sort of regular mass carnage in
  schools, churches, movie theaters and other places in the US that would be
  unthinkable in most other countries around the world. “There is no reason that
  someone should be able to reel off 30 shots before they even have to reload,”
  said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis. “We’re not talking about your
  father’s hunting rifle here. We’re talking about guns that are built to pierce
  armor and kill people.”
