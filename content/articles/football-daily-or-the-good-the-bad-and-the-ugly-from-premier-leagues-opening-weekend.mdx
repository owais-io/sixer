  AND IT BEGINS (AGAIN) Football in August is a lie, as they say in Italy and on
  the evidence of the opening weekend’s action in the Premier League there’ll be
  no shortage of managers, players and fans already hoping what they saw unfold
  before them was fake news. But before Football Daily reacts to what we
  witnessed in the past three days with a series of potentially ACL-rupturing
  knee-jerks, it behoves us to doff the company titfer in the direction of
  Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers and their respective sets of fans, whose
  heartfelt tributes to their former player Diogo Jota and his brother André
  Silva could not have been handled more deftly and were both poignant enough to
  bring a tear to a glass eye. Chapeau to each and every person concerned. On an
  emotional night at Anfield, Liverpool got their title defence off to a
  winning, if not entirely convincing, start against Bournemouth. The less said
  about that no-mark who has had his collar felt for targeting Antoine Semenyo
  the better but the Bournemouth winger rose above it in fine style, both on the
  pitch and afterwards on Instagram, even if his side were eventually beaten by
  two late goals. “Football showed its best side when it mattered most,” wrote
  the Ghana international, in a line he couldn’t have got more straight if it
  had been his completely unimpeded sprint from one penalty area to the other
  with the ball at his feet before spanking an unstoppable shot past Alisson. On
  a weekend of many first appearances, some were more auspicious than others. No
  fewer than eight different players made debuts for the home side as newly
  promoted Sunderland demolished West Ham in the kind of scintillating top-tier
  performance not witnessed at the Stadium of Light since Beyoncé shook her
  booty there in May 2023. It was a victory that took Reggie Le Bris’s side to
  the nosebleed-inducing heights of the Premier League summit until Manchester
  City knocked them off their perch with a statement win over Wolves. A stellar
  first contribution under Pep Guardiola from Tijjani Reijnders prompted gasps
  of admiration and widespread queries of “Kevin who?” At Stamford Bridge, the
  first ever explanation for a VAR decision to be announced over a top-flight
  Tannoy by the match-referee was similarly well received, due in no small part
  because it went in favour of the home team despite involving a law of the game
  few present had ever heard of, or seen applied since its inception in 2019. Of
  course not everyone’s season got off to a flyer and Sunderland’s fellow new
  boys Burnley shipped an ominous hiding at Spurs. At Villa Park, Anthony Elanga
  showed no end of willing for Newcastle, but two missed chances and an
  embarrassing clank off his shins meant that his was ultimately a debut to
  forget. “If anything, Clive, he was trying too hard”, but unlike some at least
  he deigned to turn up. On the subject of world-class strikers, Mikel Arteta
  finally got to showcase the one Arsenal have been crying out for and Viktor
  Gyökeres only went and played with all the presence, poise and clinical
  precision of a fly-tipped fridge. A fan plucked at random from the Old
  Trafford away end would almost certainly have notched up the same number of
  goals (zero), assists (zero), shots on or off target (zero) and chances
  created (zero) as the Swede on his debut but his new side were only playing
  Manchester United … so they obviously still won. “We have players to win any
  game in the Premier League,” honked Ruben Amorim moments after his team had
  been beaten, proving it’s not just Italian football in August that has a
  tenuous relationship with the truth. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Will Unwin at
  8pm (BST) for red-hot live updates on Leeds 0-0 Everton.  QUOTE OF THE DAY I’m
  ashamed. I’m totally disappointed with our performance [against Vasco]. The
  fans have every right to protest, obviously without using violence. But if
  they want to curse and insult, they’re in their right. To sum up our attitude
  on the field, it was terrible. I’ve never experienced this [a 6-0 defeat] in
  my life. The tears were from anger, from everything. Unfortunately, I can’t
  help in every way. I think everyone today needs to go home and think about
  what they want to do” – Neymar’s return to Santos continues to be emotional –
  just not in the way he envisaged when he rejoined his boyhood club early this
  year.  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Manchester United fans must be revelling in a
  new-found period of stability. Last season United finished in a distinctly
  horrible 15th place. But after the first Premier League weekend of the 2025-26
  season the Red Devils are 15th. Remarkable, and all it took was forking out
  £200m for a new forward line. By jingo, they might even score a goal next time
  — but let’s not get carried away just yet” – Mark McFadden. Well at least some
  positivity emerged (in our house at least) in the Liverpool v Bournemouth
  game. Thanks to some especially appalling pronunciation on my part, to the
  hilarity of my teenage sons I invented a new In The Night Garden character
  called Ecky-Tecky. Probably friends with Makka Pakka, meaning he’ll have a
  strange obsession with (John) Stones in due course. Travels separately to
  games via Ninky Nonk. Anyhoo(ha), erm, must go” – Kevin Goddard. Re: the
  Marshall Islands section in Friday’s email. When I was a kid I often had a
  soft spot for teams just because they had a great kit, and I’m sure I’m not
  the only one. Now, 50 years later, I will be looking out for how the Marshall
  Islands are doing, because that kit is something else” – Iggy. Hi, how often
  are your newsletters – I’m enjoying them thanks?” – Daryl J (and no others).
