  Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday instructing federal
  prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against individuals who burn American
  flags during protests. The order tells the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to
  look at cases where people burned flags and see if they can be charged with
  other crimes like disturbing the peace or breaking environmental laws. It’s an
  attempt by Trump to go around a supreme court decision from 1989, when the
  court ruled 5-4 in Texas v Johnson that destroying the flag is protected
  political expression under the first amendment. That court ruling threw out
  flag-burning laws in 48 states and made it clear that people have the right to
  burn flags as a way to express their political views. “All over the country
  they’re burning flags,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday when he signed
  the order. “All of over the world they burn the American flag, and as you
  know, through a very sad court, I guess it was a 5-4 decision, they called it
  freedom of speech. Trump also claimed “you burn a flag, you get one year in
  jail” as he signed the executive order, but the order itself doesn’t include
  details about a potential jail sentence. Trump has long advocated for
  criminalizing flag burning. In 2016, he posted on social media: “Nobody should
  be allowed to burn the American flag – if they do, there must be consequences
  – perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!” Most Americans tend to agree
  with Trump on this issue. Polling conducted by YouGov in 2020 showed nearly
  half of Americans support making flag destruction illegal, while about
  one-third believe it’s permissible. An updated YouGov survey from September
  2023 found that 59% of Americans now consider burning an American flag during
  protests to be “always unacceptable”.
