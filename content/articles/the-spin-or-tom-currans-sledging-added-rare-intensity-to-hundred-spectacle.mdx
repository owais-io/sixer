  “Fat slob?” Well that’s not very nice. But as insults go, I suppose it gets
  the job done. What’s that? I’ve got a what … a surfboard on my front leg? A
  surf … say again, Davey? No, you’ve lost me. It has been a busy few weeks for
  the sledgers. First up, Liam Livingstone v Tom Curran. Ding Ding! Curran
  normally gives off the energy of a man who would only really emerge from his
  perma-chilled bunker if, say, someone smashed his avocado the wrong way. Yet
  here he was on a Tuesday evening at Edgbaston throwing off his fedora and
  dungaree sporting coffee-bro image to give his “good friend” Livingstone an
  earful as his Oval Invincibles grappled with Birmingham Phoenix. “He is one of
  my good friends and he called me a fat slob or something,” said Livingstone
  after bludgeoning a match-winning 69 not out that included marmalising Rashid
  Khan for three sixes and two fours and taking Curran for 21 runs off the nine
  balls he faced from him, adding: “I have no idea why Tom started to spray me.”
  You suspect those in charge of the tournament were clapping their hands at the
  heated exchange and ensuing pyrotechnics. One of the many criticisms aimed at
  the Hundred is that the freshly minted teams are here today and gone tomorrow
  (or here for August, forgotten by September) and thus for players and fans it
  is all a bit of a “hit and giggle”, an easy pay cheque for the former and a
  fun but forgettable evening out for the latter. The jeopardy and raised
  emotions surrounding the Hundred have always been off the field rather than on
  it. While Curran’s sledge was crass, here was a passage of play where the
  intensity and war of words added to the spectacle, showed that the players do
  have skin in the game, crisp branded epidermis at most, perhaps, but something
  at least. Still, Vikram Banerjee’s talk of injecting tribalism into the
  Hundred and creating more of a football fandom among the supporters still
  seems far-fetched. Last year the competition’s now managing director told
  journalists: “I’m an Aston Villa fan, for my sins, and I travel up to
  Middlesbrough and down to Bournemouth and wherever else to watch my team.
  That’s where we want to get the Hundred to: fans of London Spirit travelling
  around the country, rather than it being a day out. That’s what we’re looking
  to do.” Banerjee’s sunlit upland of Danny Dyer interviewing face-pixellated
  Welsh Fire ultras in a back street near Sophia Gardens still seems a long way
  away. Let’s be clear – that isn’t a bad thing. And yet, compared with the
  bone-crunching eyeball-melting intensity of the England v India Test series
  just gone, the Hundred still pales in comparison. Tuning into the tournament
  in its first few days after that last morning of the Test series at the Oval
  was a significant drop-off not just in spectacle but intensity, like being
  airlifted from an SAS interrogation chamber and dumped on your sofa in front
  of The One Show, joggers flecked with Dorito dust but the distant sound of
  Mohammed Siraj’s gunfire still echoing in your ears. Along with the absorbing
  cricket there was a significant side portion of needle in the Test series. As
  is the way with these things, some of it added to the drama and some it was
  fairly risible. With on-field sledging it’s often a fine line between a
  genuinely pithy one-liner and cringeworthy stag-do bore. For every “Mind the
  windows, Tino” or “When in Rome, dear boy” there’s a thousand “Grow some
  fucking balls” or Harry Brook offering a cod-handshake. The fifth Test at the
  Oval did see something noteworthy, the usually unflappable Joe Root clearly
  angered by something Prasidh Krishna muttered to him. While England’s greatest
  modern batter didn’t go the full Zidane and plant a helmeted-head-butt into
  the bowler’s chest, he was about as angry as he has ever appeared on a cricket
  pitch in his career. What did Krishna say? It must’ve been bad to get Root –
  who usually deflects any sledging as deftly as one of his glides behind point
  with a boyish grin – ticking like Malcolm Tucker on election night. The stump
  mic didn’t pick up the exchange, adding to the intrigue, only for Krishna to
  later play it down while admitting it was a preconceived plan to try to put
  Root off his game. Root was clearly ruffled and fell not long after for 29,
  considerably less than his series average of 67.12, so you could say that
  India’s plan worked … or that Root just got a good ball from Siraj. One thing
  is for sure, with the Ashes looming a few months away there will be no
  shortage of words flying back and forth between the hemispheres. David Warner
  described Root as England’s “big anchor” before sticking a few jabs in about
  his lack of a Test century in Australia and declaring: “Josh Hazlewood tends
  to have his number quite a lot. He will have to take the surfboard off his
  front leg.” Root has fallen to Hazlewood lbw a grand total of three times in
  Test matches so Warner’s surfboard is more of a children’s pool float. Root is
  always adapting and advancing his game. They are just some of the traits that
  make him one of the all-time great batters. Far easier to ignore an off-field
  slight than a jibe out in the heat of the middle but perhaps Root made a
  mental note after losing his cool with Krishna. He was back to his phlegmatic
  default in his response to Warner’s brand of walrus-tached shit-stirring –
  describing it as “irrelevant” and “all part of the fun”. The famously
  non-sledging Curtly Ambrose used to say he preferred to let the ball do his
  talking for him. Root knows the ultimate riposte will be with his bat and in
  the scorebook. Everything else is just hot air. This is an extract from the
