  Sea-Fever I must down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, And
  all I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer her by. And the wheel’s kick and
  the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking, And a grey mist on the sea’s
  face and a grey dawn breaking. I must down to the seas again, for the call of
  the running tide Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; And
  all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying, And the flung spray and
  the blown spume, and the seagulls crying. I must down to the seas again to the
  vagrant gypsy life, To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s
  like a whetted knife; And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing
  fellow-rover, And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over. My
  poetry-reading these days falls into two main categories, discovery and
  re-discovery. But sometimes they overlap. Discovery doesn’t dawn only from new
  poets and collections. Dusting off work I’m supposedly familiar with can
  suddenly reveal new perspectives, especially with a good editor as guide. Last
  week I re-read John Masefield as the result of a conversation with a
  writer-friend who gives readings to groups of adult-newcomers to poetry, often
  bringing well-known hits into his playlist. We soon got into a conversation
  about John Masefield’s Sea-Fever (tried, tested but, we agreed, far from
  tired) and he raised a question about the first line: should it be “I must go
  down to the seas again” or “I must down to the seas again”? I wasn’t sure; he
  wasn’t sure. I checked in at home with the almost eponymous Sea-Fever:
  Selected Poems, edited by Philip W Errington, published in 2023. Errington has
  re-printed the poem as it appeared in Masefield’s first collection, Salt Water
  Ballads, 1902, where the word “go” is also omitted. The “saltiness” in these
  early poems is often supplied by the mariners’ dialect as they discuss death
  at sea, whether by shipwreck or as the result of yellow fever. When
  Masefield’s poetic persona is close to himself, any lingering saline trace of
  dialect is washed by an inflowing fresh water tide of romantic longing. The
  sea is an image of seemingly free movement, and poems like The West Wind and
  Sea-Fever itself convey that double-expanse: the ever-moving sea and wind, and
  the human freedom these elements can symbolise. Less specific than some of the
  poems about the technicalities of sailing, Sea-Fever is a picture made of
  verbs, assonance, and the conjunction “and”, woven into the rhythmic strokes
  of a seven-beat line that joins what would be two lines in a traditional
  ballad. In each of the Sea-Fever quatrains, two couplets share a shanty-like
  call-and-response. The first ends firmly on the final stress (“sky”, “by”/
  “tide, “denied”/ “life”, “knife”) while the second revises the rhythmic
  emphasis with feminine endings (“shaking”, “breaking”/ “flying”, “crying”/
  “fellow-rover”, “over”). Herring-gulls are constantly “crying” in that long
  “i” sound. But a word with a short “i” (“trick”) is the clinching effect in
  the last line: as so often, the voyage concludes with death, but the
  characterisation of life as “the long trick” is what stands out, suddenly
  intruding on those cliches of “quiet sleep” and “sweet dream” with an
  unforeseeable adjective-noun combination: “And quiet sleep and a sweet dream
  when the long trick’s over.” But what of that first line, and the word “go” –
  added for the first time in Ballads and Poems, 1910, present in the 1922
  Selected Poems, lacking in the 1923 Collected Poems, but back in place in the
  revised Collected Poems in 1946? Errington quotes from Linda Hart’s A First
  Line Mystery published in The Journal of the John Masefield Society in 1993:
  “When asked, in 1927, about the first line of the poem, Masefield stated ‘… I
  notice that in the early edition, 1902, I print the line “I must down”. That
  was as I wrote the line in the first instance … When I am reciting the poem I
  usually insert the word “go”. When the poem is spoken I feel the need of the
  word but in print “go” is unnecessary and looks ill.’” From Masefield’s
  comments, it seems he found “I must down to the seas again” unnatural to
  speak, but that he preferred it to the less jinglingly dactylic rhythm that
  “go” created on the page. “I must down” is literary, antiquated diction for
  1902. The replacement of verb by preposition has distinguished idiomatic
  ancestry, though. There’s a similar turn of phrase from Shakespeare in King
  Lear, when Lear says to Cordelia: “Come, let’s away to prison …” The
  noticeable jolt in Sea-Fever from the reference to “the vagrant gypsy life” is
  explained in another illuminating editorial note. In manuscript drafts the
  poem begins, sea-less, “I must go down to the roads again” or “I must out on
  the roads again”. Those discarded “roads” might have led Masefield to the
  kenning-like “gull’s way” and “whale’s way”. Perhaps the freedom of the sea
  and that of the open road and the community of the travellers remained joined
  together in Masefield’s imagination. By omitting the all-too-necessary
  “roads”, the Wolverhampton-based poet of the new 20th century expresses the
  hallucinatory quality of his longing for what had been a mixed blessing at the
  time, the life of a sailor. His first impulse, to avoid the pedestrian “go
  down”, is the right one. He is murmuring to himself as if in a fever-dream: “I
  must down to the seas again …”
