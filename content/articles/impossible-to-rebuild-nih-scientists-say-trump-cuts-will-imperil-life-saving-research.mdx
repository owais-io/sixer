  Last week, the office of management and budget (OMB) revealed plans to freeze
  all outside funding for National Institutes of Health research this fiscal
  year, but reversed course later that day, leaving the scientific community in
  a state of whiplash. A senior official at the NIH who spoke on condition of
  anonymity said this was just the latest in a “multi-prong” approach by the
  Trump administration to destroy American scientific research. In July, the
  National Cancer Institute, which is part of the NIH, updated its website to
  reflect Trump administration plans to significantly cut cancer research
  spending as well. Since January, the administration has been cancelling NIH
  grants, in some cases targeting other specific research areas, such as HIV
  treatment and prevention. “It’s really, really bad at NIH right now,” said the
  official, who added that researchers working outside the NIH have been unaware
  of the severity of the situation until recently, even though they have also
  faced funding upheaval since the winter. “The Trump administration is, for the
  first time in history, substantially intervening inside NIH to bring it under
  political control,” the official said. “That’s what we saw this week with the
  OMB freeze on funding.” “I think the core of it is that they want to destroy
  universities, or at least turn them into rightwing ideological factories,” the
  official said, since the majority of the NIH’s grants are distributed to
  researchers in universities, medical schools and similar institutions. In
  2021, JD Vance gave a speech entitled The Universities Are the Enemy. The
  official said they were alarmed at how little universities are fighting back –
  many have settled with the administration, which has “gotten Columbia to
  completely knuckle under. One of America’s most significant universities and a
  place that is a worldwide magnet for talents. Same thing at Penn. Now they’re
  going after UCLA.” Institutions such as the National Academies of Sciences,
  Engineering, and Medicine have also stayed on the sidelines, refusing to
  sufficiently resist Trump, the official said. If the administration does
  manage to freeze NIH funding, it will push to rescind the funds permanently
  using a rescission motion, the official said. This type of motion only
  requires a simple majority of 50 votes to pass the Senate, instead of the
  supermajority necessary to beat a filibuster. Republicans would have enough
  votes to “ram through these motions to effectively cut the budget without
  Democrats in Congress weighing in. It’s an ongoing disaster.” Researchers at
  the many universities where the administration has frozen funding, such as
  Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, are starting to feel the
  gravity of the situation, said the official. Carole LaBonne, a biologist at
  Northwestern, said “university labs are hanging by a thread”, explaining that
  even though the OMB reversed its decision to freeze outside NIH funding, “the
  baseline reality is not much better”. Other recent changes at the NIH include
  allocating research grants all at once rather than over multiple years, so
  that fewer projects are funded. Reductions in cancer research funding also
  mean that only 4% of relevant grant applications will move forward. “This will
  effectively shut down cancer research in this country and destroy the careers
  of many scientists. This is devastating,” LaBonne said. The extreme
  uncertainty surrounding scientific research is also negatively affecting
  scientists’ mental health. “I do not know any faculty who are not incredibly
  stressed right now, wondering how long they will be able to keep their labs
  going and if/when they will have to let laboratory staff go,” LaBonne said.
  “It also very hard to motivate oneself to write grants, a painstaking and
  time-intensive processes, when there is a 96% chance it will not be funded.”
  Ryan Gutenkunst, who heads the department of molecular and cellular biology at
  the University of Arizona, said: “The chaos at NIH is definitely freaking
  [faculty and students] out and wasting huge amounts of emotional energy and
  time. We were emailing about the latest pause, only to find it unpaused hours
  later.” The senior NIH official found last week’s events unsurprising, they
  said: “They’re throwing everything at the wall to stop NIH from spending. What
  struck me was that many of my colleagues at universities were like, ‘Oh, my
  God, they’re stopping grants.’ And it really seemed to activate people in a
  way that I hadn’t seen before, whereas a lot of us at NIH thought, ‘Oh, they
  just did another thing.’” Science is an engine for American economic
  dominance, and scientific clusters such as Silicon Valley could not exist
  without federal funding, the official said. “Once you break them, it will be
  impossible to rebuild them. We’re on the path to breaking them.” LaBonne said
  she worried about the impact on progress in cancer specifically. “My own
  research touches on pediatric cancers. Forty years ago more than 60% of
  children diagnosed with cancer would have died within five years of diagnosis.
  Today there is a 90% survival rate. We should not put progress like that in
  danger,” she said. Although many major scientific institutions have complied
  with the administration, grassroots organizations and individual scientists,
  including those within the NIH, are finding ways to resist. The senior NIH
  official said they were most hopeful about grassroots organizers who are
  resisting the Trump administration openly, rather than relying on older
  strategies such as litigation and negotiations with Congress. For example,
  Science Homecoming, a website to promote science communication, is encouraging
  scientists to get the word out about the importance of federal funding to
  their home towns. The Bethesda Declaration, signed by 484 NIH staff, directly
  accused NIH director Jay Bhattacharya of “a failure of your legal duty to use
  congressionally appropriated funds for critical NIH research. Each day that
  the NIH continues to disrupt research, your ability to deliver on this duty
  narrows.”
