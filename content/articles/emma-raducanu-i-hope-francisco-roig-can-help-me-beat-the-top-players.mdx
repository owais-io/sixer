  Emma Raducanu believes her new coaching partnership with Francisco Roig can
  help to take her game to the next level as she tries to continue her recent
  rise up the rankings. “First impressions are it’s going really well,” Raducanu
  said, speaking for the first time about the move in an interview with the
  Guardian. “We did a few days after Wimbledon together and I was really happy
  with how it went. I’m just so excited to have him on board, so much
  experience. I’m really looking forward to continuing.” With her hiring of
  Roig, Raducanu has indeed added a wealth of experience to her team. A former
  player with a career-high singles ranking of No 60 in 1992, Roig came to
  prominence as a longtime member of Rafael Nadal’s coaching team, working
  alongside Toni Nadal, Rafael’s uncle and coach, as the Spaniard built one of
  the greatest careers in the history of professional tennis. Roig himself
  decided to end his 18-year partnership with Nadal in 2022 and he later briefly
  coached the injury-prone Italian Matteo Berrettini. Although Raducanu’s
  numerous coaching changes have been a big narrative in her career, this new
  appointment comes at a different point in her development. Raducanu has put
  together a consistent run of quality tennis over the past few months; she is
  clearly playing with confidence on the court and is in a far more positive
  place away from the court. The Briton had been working on an ad hoc basis with
  Mark Petchey since March but Petchey, who is also a broadcaster, could not
  fully commit to work with her on a day-to-day basis. The pair remain in close
  contact. Now at No 33 in the WTA rankings and 26 in the WTA race, a good
  showing in Cincinnati would lead to her being seeded at a grand slam
  tournament for the first time since her US Open points fell off. Raducanu,
  seeded 30th here, has received a first-round bye and will play her opening
  match on Saturday. After a brief trial period following her run to the third
  round at Wimbledon this year, Raducanu opted to work with Roig and they have
  agreed a contract until the end of the year. She is hopeful that he can help
  her to take another step forward: “I think I can definitely improve on a lot
  of my shots, just the quality of them,” Raducanu said. “I think I’ve been good
  at being creative, scrapping, playing the big points well, but I think the
  overall quality of my game needs to be better. And I see that when I play the
  really top players where I can’t run and scrap, wait on them to miss. I think
  that’s where I need to improve. And yeah, I’m hoping he can help me with
  that.” Raducanu and Roig began their partnership with a long day of training
  on Tuesday, following up her morning sparring session with Rebecca Sramkova of
  Slovakia with an evening training session on a remote court with only Roig.
  There was plenty of laughter alongside their high-intensity work. Raducanu
  then pushed back her media duties by an hour on Wednesday to spend extra time
  on the practice court and she finished her day with another session. Such is
  the nature of professional tennis, where players and their team members spend
  a significant period of time together while travelling on the tour, another
  challenge for Raducanu and Roig will be to connect on a personal level. The
  vast Ohio roads may prove to be an icebreaker between them. At Cincinnati, the
  seeded players are given cars to drive to and from the tournament venue. “I
  actually drove from the airport,” the 22-year-old said. “I didn’t know I had a
  car, so I landed, and they were like: ‘Oh, you have a car,’ and it’s this
  massive Cadillac Escalade. So I’m like: ‘This is like a bus’. Obviously in
  England, we’re used to driving small cars, small roads, so I was a bit tight.
  Wrong side of the road as well. But it’s OK. I managed to get to the hotel.”
  Since then, Raducanu has handed over driving responsibilities to Roig. As with
  his coaching capabilities, her first impressions of his driving skills are
  positive: “So far so good,” she said, smiling. “It’s been tested too, in the
  dark, in the rain, in the sun. It’s fine.”
