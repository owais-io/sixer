  The world’s largest wealth fund has excluded Caterpillar, the construction
  equipment manufacturer, over Israel’s use of its bulldozers to destroy
  Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank. Norway’s $2tn (£1.5tn) fund
  said on Monday it had excluded Caterpillar and five Israeli banking groups on
  ethics grounds. While the fund has already excluded more than 20 Israeli
  companies this year, Caterpillar is the first big US company to be removed
  through the wealth fund’s ongoing review to ensure its investments do not
  contribute to violations of international law. “There is no doubt that
  Caterpillar’s products are being used to commit extensive and systematic
  violations of international humanitarian law,” said the fund’s independent
  council on ethics. It added that the machinery was “being used by Israeli
  authorities in the widespread unlawful destruction of Palestinian property”.
  The violations were taking place in Gaza and the West Bank, the council said,
  adding that “the company has also not implemented any measures to prevent such
  use”. “As deliveries of the relevant machinery to Israel are now set to
  resume, the council considers there to be an unacceptable risk that
  Caterpillar is contributing to serious violations of individuals’ rights in
  war or conflict situations,” it said. The fund said had not independently
  assessed all aspects of the recommendations but found them sufficiently
  substantiated that the criteria for exclusion have been fulfilled. Norges Bank
  Investment Management (NBIM) held $2.1bn (£1.6bn) of shares in Caterpillar,
  about 1.2% of all shares issued, as of 30 June, which made it the company’s
  eighth-largest shareholder. The fund also excluded First International Bank of
  Israel, Bank Leumi Le-Israel, Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, Fibi Holdings and Bank
  Hapoalim, because of the five banks’ financing of construction activities
  “that contribute to the maintenance of Israeli settlements”, the council said
  in its recommendation. The fund said that the six groups were being excluded
  “due to an unacceptable risk that the companies contribute to serious
  violations of the rights of individuals in situations of war and conflict”.
  The total value of the divestments being made by the fund is close to $3bn.
  Last year, the United Nations’ top court found that Israeli settlements built
  on territory occupied in 1967 were illegal, a ruling that Israel called
  “fundamentally wrong”, citing historical and biblical ties to the land. NBIM,
  which owns about 1.5% of the world’s listed stocks, operates on a mandate set
  by Norway’s parliament with ethical guidelines. It is advised by an external
  ethics council, a public body set up by Norway’s ministry of finance, which
  regularly assesses its portfolio of holdings and recommends companies for
  observation or exclusion.
