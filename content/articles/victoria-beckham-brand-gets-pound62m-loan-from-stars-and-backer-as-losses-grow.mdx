  David and Victoria Beckham and the private equity firm Neo have pumped a
  further £6.2m into the former Spice Girl’s fashion empire this year as losses
  widened to almost £5m despite a surge in sales last year. Sales rose 26.5% to
  £112.7m in 2024, the brand’s fourth consecutive year of growth, helped by
  strong sales online and at Victoria Beckham’s London flagship store, as well
  as a 24% leap in online sales of cosmetics, including a new concealer pen and
  eyeliner. However, accounts filed at Companies House show that the
  shareholders advanced an additional £6.2m loan this year amid “material
  uncertainties which may cast significant doubt over the group and company’s
  ability to continue as a going concern”. These uncertainties included the need
  to extend a £4.1m bank loan, which the accounts say is due for repayment next
  week, after pre-tax losses widened to £4.8m, from £2.9m in 2023. It is
  understood that a loan extension is expected to be signed later this week. The
  latest cash injection comes on top of £6.9m in cash and loans from
  shareholders put into the company last year. Shareholders include the former
  Spice Girls manager and Pop Idol founder Simon Fuller as well as Neo and the
  Beckhams. The accounts said these new funds were to help “sustain the group’s
  growth plans”, “drive cost reductions” and “a streamlining of operations and
  creating a model for the longer term”. Plans include a presence in more
  department stores across the UK and France, while the brand will get a lift
  from the launch of Victoria Beckham’s docuseries on Netflix, which will focus
  on this year’s spring/summer Paris fashion week show. The business’ net
  liabilities are £29.7m, a figure that has narrowed by almost £10m on a year
  before. Despite the ongoing losses at the fashion and beauty business,
  Victoria and David Beckham are together worth £500m, according to the latest
  Sunday Times Rich List. David Beckham earned £28m in dividends from his
  personal brand empire since 2022, as new commercial tie-ins with companies
  such as Stella Artois and Boss helped to offset losses at his TV production
  studio. The former England captain, who retired from professional football in
  2013, sold a 55% stake in his businesses in 2022 to Authentic Brands for
  £200m.
