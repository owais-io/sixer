  The New South Wales health minister has encouraged people to call the health
  hotline instead of going to emergency departments as a spike in winter
  illnesses has doctors saying overcrowding is the “worst they have ever seen”.
  In a statement on Thursday, Ryan Park said there had been more than 45,000
  presentations to EDs over the past five days. Monday peaked with almost 10,000
  presentations, a 9.2% increase from the same time in July last year, Park
  said. The previous week there were more than 900 presentations for
  influenza-like illness in NSW, the statement said. Park said officials were
  working on “relieving pressure on our busy emergency departments by creating
  more alternative pathways to care outside the hospital”. He encouraged people
  to call Healthdirect for 24-hour health advice for non-life-threatening
  conditions. Sign up: AU Breaking News email An emergency physician in
  south-west Sydney, speaking anonymously as a delegate for the doctor’s union,
  Asmof, said “myself and my colleagues all agree that this has been the worst
  winter by far, and the level of overcrowding in our ED is the worst we’ve ever
  seen. “It’s getting worse year on year … we are doing the most that we can.
  We’re being asked to do more with the same resources. “That doesn’t work with
  a population that is ageing, a population that cannot get a GP appointment.”
  Park thanked health staff for their work during the “very busy” winter period.
  He said it was pleasing to see semi-urgent and non-urgent presentations
  continuing to decrease across NSW EDs. But the NSW faculty chair for the
  Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Dr Rhys Ross-Browne, said those
  lower acuity patients don’t take up a lot of resources in the ED. He agreed
  there has been a decline, roughly 10%, in patients with low acuity
  presentations coming to the ED. He said that reflected a stronger range of
  alternatives for patients to get unscheduled care outside the ED. However, he
  said EDs continue to experience very high numbers of very sick people who take
  up the majority of resourcing and time but can’t get a bed in another part of
  the hospital. “That’s the bulk of our workload – that’s what keeps the
  emergency department full.” According to the bureau of health information, in
  the first quarter of 2025, the median time a patient is treated and admitted
  to hospital or transferred to another hospital was eight hours. Ross-Browne
  said the target is 80% of patients admitted or transferred to admitted
  hospital should have an ED time of less than six hours. The report showed 10%
  of people arriving in EDs needing admission to hospital or transfer to another
  hospital were recorded at almost 22 hours. Ross-Browne said the source of
  problem was hospitals don’t have sufficient capacity to meet demand. Another
  significant driver, he said, was the large number of patients in acute
  hospital beds who no longer need hospital care but can’t leave because they
  don’t have an aged care home or NDIS supported accommodation to go to. The
  anonymous emergency physician agreed: “The reason [EDs are] overcrowded is
  because there are no beds available within the hospital.” They accused the
  state government of not investing in the future of public health, “whether
  it’s through ignorance or … because it’s a political headache”. Another
  emergency physician, speaking anonymously as an Asmof delegate, questioned the
  value in the minister directing people to call Healthdirect, because the
  nurses can’t examine the person, so they often end up sending them to hospital
  anyway. The chief operations officer of Healthdirect, Travis Hodgson, said
  “many callers are uncertain about the care they need, and our role is to guide
  them to the most appropriate service for their situation”. He said for callers
  considering an ED, nurses safely de-escalate that need 61% of the time –
  instead connecting them to urgent care clinics, their GP, virtual care
  services or supporting them to self-care. It comes as the union has been
  running its campaign – “Can’t see a doctor? Ask the premier” – since their
  industrial action in April. Posters with the slogan have been seen in
  emergency departments. Park said “the claims made regarding wait times, beds
  and staff are unsubstantiated”. Park said more T2 emergency patients were
  being treated on time than two years ago and more beds are coming into the
  health system. He said 2,500 nurses will be recruited as part of safe staffing
  ratios, and there are almost 3,000 more health workers in the public system
  than a year ago. Park said there has been a significant escalation in the
  number of people waiting for aged care or NDIS placements in NSW public
  hospitals, which the system was not designed for. Do you know more? Have you
