  Texas governor Greg Abbott on Monday ordered the department of public safety
  to arrest and return any House member who had left the state and “abandoned
  their duty to Texans”, as Democrats thwarted plans to redistrict the state
  along lines that would favour Republicans. “There are consequences for
  dereliction of duty,” Abbott said in a statement on Monday, after the
  Republican-dominated House issued civil arrest warrants in an attempt to
  compel the return of the members who fled the state in order to deny the
  legislature a quorom. “This order will remain in effect until all missing
  Democrat House members are accounted for and brought to the Texas Capitol.”
  Democrats hold 62 of the 150 seats in the legislature’s lower chamber, so as
  long as at least 51 members remain out of Austin, the Texas legislature cannot
  move forward with any votes, including a plan to redraw the state’s
  congressional maps to give Republicans five more seats in Congress. Here are
  the key US politics stories of the day: Texas Democrats deny quorum in attempt
  to thwart Republican plans Texas Democrats in the state legislature denied its
  speaker a legislative quorum Monday by leaving the state, forestalling plans
  proposed by the White House to redistrict Texas’s congressional lines to more
  greatly favor Republicans. Texas governor Greg Abbott has threatened arrest,
  fines, felony charges of bribery and expulsion against the lawmakers. Read the
  full story Trump firing of labor statistics chief ‘undermines credibility’,
  ex-leaders say The former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioners and
  non-partisan economic groups have criticized Donald Trump’s shock firing of
  BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report data revealed
  jobs growth stalled this summer. Read the full story Hundreds of ex-Israeli
  officials urge Trump to help end Gaza war About 600 former Israeli security
  officials, including previous heads of the Mossad and the military, have urged
  Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the war in Gaza as the country’s prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, considers expanding the conflict. In an open
  letter, the former officials said an end to the war was the only way to save
  hostages still held by Hamas. Read the full story Speaker Mike Johnson visits
  occupied West Bank to support Israeli settlers Mike Johnson became the highest
  ranked US official to visit the occupied West Bank on Monday, the Republican
  House speaker drawing measures of praise and condemnation for his trip in
  support of Israeli settlements amid a worsening starvation crisis in Gaza.

  hotel in New York More than 40 people protesting the war in Gaza and worsening
  humanitarian crisis were arrested outside the Trump International hotel in New
  York City on Monday evening. Read the full story Trump envoy to visit Moscow
  this week Donald Trump’s special envoy is expected in Moscow days before the
  US president’s deadline on Friday for Russia to make progress on ending the
  war in Ukraine or face increased US sanctions. Trump said Steve Witkoff would
  visit Moscow on Wednesday or Thursday. When asked what message Witkoff would
  take to Russia and what Vladimir Putin could do to avoid new sanctions, the US
  president answered: “Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed.” Read

  state department has prepared plans to impose bonds as high as $15,000 for

  happened today: The Swiss stock market has plunged, the cabinet has held
  crisis talks and the country’s president has been accused of mishandling a
  vital phone call with the White House after Donald Trump hit the country with

  has announced it will bring a version of the brash rightwing New York tabloid
  to California in early 2026. Marjorie Taylor Greene said that she feels the
  Republican party has lost touch with its base – but she said she has no plans
  to leave the party. More than a dozen Democratic members of Congress signed on

  statehood, in a draft copy shared with the Guardian. Catching up? Here’s what
