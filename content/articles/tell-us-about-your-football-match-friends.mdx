  We’d like to hear from people who have become football match friends. Watching
  the ups and downs of your team next to the same person at the ground can lead
  to strong bonds. Has the perfect stranger you meet only at the football become
  a close friend or an important person in your life just from your time in the
  stands? If so, we’d like to hear all about it. If you’re having trouble using
  the form, click here. Read terms of service here and privacy policy here.
