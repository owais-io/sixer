  I’ve never seen a film quite like this chaotically strange animation from
  writer-directors Tyson Yunkaporta and Jack Manning Bancroft, who fill it with
  slap-happy pleasures and plotlines that bounce around like pinballs.
  Attempting to explain the narrative is a fool’s errand, like trying to tickle
  yourself. I can say with confidence – assuming I didn’t unknowingly consume
  magic mushrooms beforehand and hallucinate the entire thing – that the story
  follows a teenager, Kim (voice of Yolande Brown), who gets pulled into a
  surreal alternate universe that they explore with their new pal Jeff
  (Yunkaporta), a bright-green alien dog. The script was conceived early in the
  pandemic via Indigenous mentoring program AIME’s educational project
  Imagi-Nation TV, which compiled contributions from more than 150 young people.
  This partly explains the film’s skittish spirit and scattershot structure.
  Like Alice tumbling through the rabbit hole, Kim travels through a vortex-like
  thoroughfare filled with swirling colours and crazy patterns, before floating
  past a giant glowing green Buddha and riding a psychedelic dragon-like snake
  thing, because why not? This isn’t social realism; look elsewhere for films
  about the lives of Polish potato farmers and Mongolian beekeepers. Kim
  functions like the lead character in Richard Linklater’s 2001 film Waking Life
  – another head trip filled with kooky elements and weird rants. They’re less
  like a protagonist than a sponge, absorbing the strange goings-on around them.
  Or perhaps more like a video game character, having a degree of agency and
  input but functioning essentially as a vessel to guide us through
  candy-coloured bizarro worlds. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In
  Imagine, these worlds take the form of five islands, where Kim and Jeff bump
  into various Aboriginal elders and eccentric creations – including, among many
  others, a rainbow serpent (voiced by Wayne Blair) and an animated version of
  Taika Waititi (voiced by the man himself), who wears a Thriller jacket and
  shares his thoughts on pursuing your dreams with Kim and a trio of insect-like
  creatures. Other supporting cast members include Yael Stone, Radical Son,
  Irmin Durand and even Ian Thorpe. We’re obviously not intended to take the
  film too seriously during its many whacked-out moments, though it also dips in
  and out of all kinds of meaty monologues and profundities. Before long, Jeff
  is engaged in deep philosophical discussion with a Viking about knowledge,
  race, culture, fascism and the foundation of life. As they talk, weird
  pirate-like rats ride jetskis towards them but never arrive. I’m not sure what
  happened to our yo-ho-ho rodent pals; this film has a habit of introducing
  things that visually pop, like firecrackers, then disappear quickly, shuffled
  off to some parallel dimension. The texture and style of the animation is an
  eclectic mixture – sometimes beautifully vivid and polished, other times
  intentionally scratchy and lo-fi. Indigenous perspectives are laced throughout
  – sometimes subtly, sometimes in very striking ways. In one scene, based in
  Jeff’s home world, the lead characters are guided through a museum (called
  “HISTORY ‘n’ Other Stuff”) by an elder, who tells Kim that “this isn’t like
  the museums your people made … your people took memories and called them
  artefacts. Your people took stories and stuffed them. You put barriers, and
  walls, and ropes, and glass, between you and the past.” It’s ruminative,
  big-thinking dialogue, incorporating ancient and contemporary perspectives.
  This scene could have been wonderful, but the film’s ever-frantic approach
  boots us out of the museum posthaste. How might this moment have played out if
  the setting had been properly explored, fleshed out, mined for its narrative
  and thematic potential? I appreciated Imagine’s chaotic energy, but watching
  it felt a bit like sitting in a car that’s whizzing through all sorts of
  amazing environments, rarely slowing down so you can have a proper look. It’s
  certainly a one-of-a-kind production, and I suspect it’ll linger in the
  memory. Imagine is screening as part of Melbourne international film festival
  on 23 August.
