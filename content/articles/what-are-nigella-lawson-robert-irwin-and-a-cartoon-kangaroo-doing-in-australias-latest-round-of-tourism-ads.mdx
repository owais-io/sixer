  So Steph, what do Robert Irwin, Nigella Lawson and a cartoon kangaroo have in
  common? Wait, is this a joke? No not at all, I’m genuinely asking. Oh, sorry.
  The answer is a new round of ads spruiking Australia as a tourist destination
  to potential international visitors. Is this the latest from Scott Morrison’s
  old workplace? Do you mean Tourism Australia? Yes, the former prime minister
  and former director of Tourism Australia liked to claim he was responsible for
  the “Where the bloody hell are you?” ad that featured Lara Bingle (and was
  banned from the UK for being too risque). This new round of ads feature a
  bunch of personalities from places where the agency intends them to air. So
  the ads featuring actor Yosh Yu will show in China, those with Japanese
  comedian Abareru-kun will air in Japan, those featuring influencer Sara
  Tendulkar will run in India and Nigella Lawson will front the ads showing in
  the UK. I assume the UK don’t think Nigella Lawson is too risque. Wait, so is
  Robert Irwin supposed to be appealing to … other Australians? No, he’ll be
  shown in the ads for Americans, blasting over sand dunes in a
  four-wheel-drive, chasing an emu that’s stolen an American tourist’s phone.
  Tourism Australia’s current managing director, Phillipa Harrison, says the ads
  having international stars as well as locals in them will “create bespoke
  invitations for five markets”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Isn’t
  Robert Irwin a wildlife warrior though? Ripping it up through the sand dunes
  isn’t great for the environment, and I don’t think you’re supposed to chase
  emus. No, but these ads also feature a multilingual cartoon kangaroo, Ruby the
  Roo, who you may remember from a previous round of government tourism propaga
  … I mean, campaigns. I don’t think they’re going for realism here. The general
  gist of it is that travellers will tell their friends and family back home
  about their wild and unbelievable adventures in Australia. How much is selling
  the magic of these wild and unbelievable adventures going to cost us? About
  $130m. The argument for it is that tourism is a significant part of the
  Australian economy: around 360,000 Australian businesses rely on tourism and
  the government estimates that the number of international arrivals will hit 10
  million in 2026 and 11.8 million in 2029. When he announced the campaign, the
  tourism minister, Don Farrell, called tourism “the lifeblood of so many
  communities right around the country” and claimed the previous campaign
  “struck a chord with visitors, with Ruby the Roo bounding into the imagination
  of countless guests”. Please tell me that they’ve at least stopped leaning
  into cliches about Australia when trying to sell us to the world? It’s an
  extension of the “Come and Say G’day” campaign from 2022. I regret to inform
  you that this version features pavlova, beaches and a riff on the old
  Crocodile Dundee “shrimp on the barbie” line. I can hear you groaning from
  here. Didn’t Tourism Australia also once have an ad where Kylie Minogue sang a
  song of mateship? Let’s not go there.
