  “The lid is obviously not on, is it?” Adelaide coach Matthew Nicks said late
  on Saturday night. He was talking about the town, not the team. It was the
  third-biggest crowd at the redeveloped Adelaide Oval, topped only by the
  opening day of an Ashes Test match and an Adele concert. It was the most
  important game Adelaide has played since the 2017 grand final. It was a game
  that mirrored the respective seasons of the two teams – Collingwood flew the
  gates, and the Crows overhauled them. It was a strange game that went into
  neutral for about an hour, and then into overdrive in the final 10 minutes. It
  was a game that made no sense on the stat sheet; a game that demanded a
  rematch – most likely again in Adelaide, hopefully in better conditions, and
  maybe even at the MCG on the final Saturday in September. Hawthorn knocked the
  stuffing out of Collingwood the week before but there was much to admire about
  their response. Their backline in particular was often fighting out of its
  weight and class division but they were resolute and on their toes all night.
  The Pies had 25 inside 50s to six in the opening term, and so many of those
  entries were low altitude torps, scrubbers and end-on-enders. It was a clear
  plan and it confused what is an organised, diligent Adelaide defence. But the
  more it hosed down, and the more Collingwood extended the inside 50s count,
  the less likely they looked like converting them. It was many of Adelaide’s
  unheralded players, especially their defenders, who almost never got
  out-marked and who thwarted dozens of attacks. Meteorological and tactical
  intervention altered the tempo of the game several times. For long periods, it
  was a slog. “If it’s going to be hard for us to score, we’ll make it
  impossible for them,” Craig McRae said. But the Crows were the more patient
  and efficient team. The final few minutes had the lot. It had Riley
  Thilthorpe, with his civil war beard and his bung neck, out-marking three of
  the biggest Collingwood players. It had some Nick Daicos magic. It had some
  highly contentious umpiring. It had bodies flailing. It had Scott Pendlebury
  just ambling and pointing his way through the mayhem like he was out for a
  post-downpour Saturday evening stroll. Adelaide has played some excellent
  football against Collingwood in the Nicks era, but they just haven’t been able
  to get the win. They played a classic at the Adelaide Oval in Collingwood’s
  premiership year when the Crows skipped away to a big early lead, and the
  follow up game at the MCG was also close. Last year, they were closing in on
  the Pies when Izak Rankine was pinged for running too far. Normally so
  even-tempered, Nicks was filthy that day. “We’re sick of learning,” he said.
  Earlier this year at the MCG, they ran them close, but didn’t seize their
  chances. Rankine sent two set shots sailing out on the full and Dan Curtin
  also missed a sitter. Nicks said they were a good team that’d been beaten by a
  great team. They were not yet ready. Once they could win a game like that, he
  said, they will have graduated as a serious team. That’s indisputable now.
  They’ve locked in two home finals. They’ve broken a hoodoo stretching back to
  2016. If Rankine is suspended for allegedly making a homophobic slur, it makes
  their task considerably harder, but they remain a worthy premiership
  favourite. It was interesting to compare the way Adelaide handled the home
  hype with how Fremantle did. Unlike the Crows, the Dockers didn’t meet the
  occasion. They were wasteful up forward, gave away too many free kicks down
  back and were out of whack right across their lines. In short, they were
  totally outclassed. Every time they’d make a meal of a seemingly certain goal,
  the ball would trampoline up the other end and Brisbane would score. They were
  pinned in their back half like an Aussie batsman facing Jasprit Bumrah. In
  contrast, the Lions still look the most likely to match it with Adelaide. As
  they flew across the country, they could still finish top two, and they could
  still miss the eight. But they travel particularly well, and you can usually
  tell within about two minutes whether Good Brisbane has made the trip. You
  could tell straight away against Geelong and Collingwood and so it proved
  again on Friday night. Every time a Lion had the ball, his eyes would shift
  slightly off centre. He’d give the international sporting sign for “come at
  me” and he’d successfully bite off the kick. They were so sharp, so precise,
  so methodical. This is the game they seek, the game that won them a
  premiership. It’s chip, chip, chip football but it’s far from boring. And it’s
  so draining for the opposition. Normally backing their ability to mow down
  teams in the last quarter, the Dockers were chasing backsides, dragging their
  heels, and contemplating a mini-elimination-final date with Messrs
  Bontempelli, Darcy and Naughton.
