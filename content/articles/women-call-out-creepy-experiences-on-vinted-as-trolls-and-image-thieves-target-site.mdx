  Users of secondhand clothing websites such as Vinted are warning about the
  danger their images will be used against their will on pornography sites, and
  sounding the alarm about the spread of sexually charged harassment under their
  posts. The potential for hijacking photos posted on the internet for real or
  faked erotic content has long been known, but victims and their advocates say
  culprits appear to have zeroed in on Vinted with targeted campaigns. Founded
  in 2008, the Lithuanian online marketplace for buying, selling and originally
  swapping secondhand and new clothing has developed into the most successful
  website of its kind in Europe, with more than 65 million registered users. Its
  popularity, particularly among young women, appears to have also made it a
  draw for misogynist trolls, image thieves and unwanted sexualised content. In
  Germany, the EU’s largest economy, there has been a wave of recent complaints,
  prompting media scrutiny of the website as users in France, Italy and Britain
  have also reported problems. One young female Vinted user identified as Mina
  went on social media last month to recount her ordeal and caution others. Her
  Instagram post has been watched more than 1.7m times and is captioned with a
  plea: “Please share so a lot of women will see it!” In the tearful video, Mina
  said pictures she had put on Vinted had apparently been copied and then posted
  on “porn sites”. She said a Google search of her name now brought up links to
  that content, just as she was applying for jobs. The Guardian could not
  independently confirm her account. In the Instagram video, she said she had
  reported the matter to Google and the German police, who do not comment on
  individual criminal complaints. This week the German news outlet Der Spiegel
  published an interview with Mina, saying she was 22 years old, lived in
  Cologne and wished to keep her surname private. It said she had used Vinted
  for “several years”. “The idea of a secondhand platform for clothes is super
  and important, also considering climate change,” she said. But she lamented
  Vinted was no longer a “safe space” for her, calling her experiences there
  “creepy”. She said she had received a barrage of abusive messages via Vinted’s
  messaging system including: “Hello, I’d like to buy this item of clothing but
  I’d like you to try it on without underwear first”, and: “Can I also buy you?”
  Others demanded “more intimate” pictures than the ones she posted. Mina said
  even more disturbing was the fact photos in which she posed in clothing she
  was trying to sell including bikini tops and summer dresses had resurfaced on
  other websites depicting her as an “erotic model” and saying she was a “naked
  OnlyFans star”. She said she had never posted nude photos online and had no
  account on the amateur pornography site. Spiegel said it found her name and
  images on sex-focused German-language forums, with links back to her Vinted
  and Instagram accounts. Several investigations have turned up similar
  complaints. In April, a joint report by the German newspaper Süddeutsche
  Zeitung and public broadcasters NDR and WDR exposed a public Telegram channel
  called Girls of Vinted launched in June 2024, and featuring more than 1,000
  pictures taken from the marketplace platform and placed in a sexualised
  context. The report said the Telegram channel featured women who appeared to
  be selling sexual services based on information included in their profiles,
  while most were there as legitimate Vinted users and showcased involuntarily.
  Several of the more than 130 women shown, many of them from Germany, Italy and
  France, reported then receiving lurid messages on their Vinted accounts.
  Before the Telegram channel was shut down earlier this year, it had
  accumulated 2,000 mainly male subscribers. In October, the UK broadcaster
  Channel 4 revealed a comparable website called Vinted Sluts. The German
  joint-investigation highlighted the case of a 26-year-old student from Berlin
  identified as Bella who had been spotlighted against her will on Girls of
  Vinted, sparking a deluge of crude come-ons and insults in several languages.
  Under one of her posts, a user asked in a Vinted chat with her: “Is it still
  available?” about an item of clothing, followed by: “And the underwear
  underneath?” “It felt disgusting,” Bella said. “Creepy.” Sonja, a 32-year-old
  lawyer who has been registered on Vinted since 2011, said she started
  receiving “offensive messages” daily after she was unwittingly listed on Girls
  of Vinted with photos of her body from the neck down wearing clothing she had
  aimed to sell. “It feels like a digital version of the street” with its
  cat-calling and sexual objectification, she said. Vinted said it exercised a
  “zero-tolerance policy” for unwanted sexually explicit communication via its
  site, removing such content as soon as it is notified. In its updated online
  help centre, it allows users to report inappropriate behaviour and content.
  This was an option used by Bella and Sonja, who said Vinted then shut down the
  offending accounts after about a week. They soon received new offensive
  messages from other accounts, however. Vinted said if users found their photos
  on third-party sites, it would contact those platforms to request removal
  “where possible”. “We have already reported such cases to Telegram via various
  channels and, in connection with the Channel 4 documentary, achieved the
  shutdown of a named website,” a company spokesperson said. Vinted advises its
  members in its community standards not to share photos in which their face is
  visible and to keep personal information such as full names, addresses and
  bank details out of private messages, while minimising data included on
  shipping labels. “We are aware of the challenges online platforms face in
  addressing inappropriate behaviour and take our members’ negative experiences
  very seriously. Safeguarding our members is an ongoing priority,” the
  spokesperson said. “We will continue to review and evolve our systems to
  prevent incidents and to respond swiftly whenever issues arise.” Legal experts
  advise users whose images have been hijacked for sexualised content to report
  it to the authorities in their country as well as the websites where they are
  posted. The EU’s Digital Services Act has required online platforms since
  February 2024 to delete illegal content that is flagged to them.
