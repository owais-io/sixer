  Bournemouth are closing in on a deal to sign the Liverpool forward Ben Doak
  for £25m. The 19-year-old would provide a huge profit for Liverpool on the
  £600,000 they paid Celtic in training compensation in 2022. The Scotland
  international has been linked with plenty of Premier League clubs and Porto
  and the proposed switch comes with Bournemouth’s Dango Ouattara poised to join
  Brentford for up to £42.5m. Doak’s Liverpool future originally looked bright
  under Jürgen Klopp, but a combination of the German’s departure, injury and
  the form of Mohamed Salah meant it felt increasingly inevitable he would need
  to kickstart his career elsewhere. Doak spent last season on loan in the
  Championship at Middlesbrough, but did not feature after late January having
  sustained a thigh injury that required surgery. Arne Slot has supplemented his
  Liverpool squad with heavy spending this summer. Doak was an unused substitute
  for last Sunday’s Community Shield at Wembley. Coincidentally, Liverpool and
  Bournemouth opened the Premier League season on Friday evening. After
  Bournemouth completed the signing of the French centre-back Bafode Diakité
  from Lille for £34.5m this week, Andoni Iraola has turned attention to
  attacking positions. Doak’s arrival comes with Luis Sinisterra expected to
  move on loan to Cruzeiro in Brazil. Manchester City and Bournemouth are
  interested in signing Josh Acheampong but Chelsea are expected to reject any
  moves for the talented young defender. Enzo Maresca has spoken glowingly of
  Acheampong and is adamant that he does not want to lose the 19-year-old. That
  has not stopped clubs tracking the youngster’s progress, though, and it is
  understood that Chelsea rebuffed a recent loan enquiry from Bournemouth.
  Newcastle have also been monitoring the situation. Bournemouth need to rebuild
  their defence after selling Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi,
  while Newcastle have been looking to add youth at the back. Sources are aware
  of furtive interest from City, who rate Acheampong but have made no solid
  moves for him. Chelsea have received no official bids and remain determined to
  keep Acheampong, who was given opportunities by Maresca last season. The
  teenager can play in a range of defensive positions and caught the eye when he
  featured during the club’s victorious Club World Cup campaign earlier this
  summer. There could be more first-team opportunities for Acheampong, who has
  repeatedly been praised by Maresca, with Levi Colwill sidelined by a serious
  knee injury. Bournemouth, City and Newcastle are not the only teams who have
  been monitoring Acheampong, who signed a five-year deal last December. Crystal
  Palace and West Ham have scouted him and there is interest from clubs in
  Europe. It remains to be seen if the situation develops before the window
  shuts. Playing time will be an obvious consideration for Acheampong as the
  season progress, although Chelsea have not given the green light to him going
  out on loan. Meanwhile Bayern Munich have opened talks with Chelsea over a
  deal for Christopher Nkunku. The France forward has fallen out of favour and
  is one of several attackers expected to leave Stamford Bridge before the
  transfer window shuts. Chelsea need to move players out before pressing ahead
  with moves for Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig’s Xavi
  Simons. They hope to negotiate a lower fee for Garnacho, who is valued at £50m
  by United. The Argentina winger wants to move to Stamford Bridge. Maresca has
  rejigged his attack this summer, signing Liam Delap, João Pedro, Estêvão
  Willian and Jamie Gittens while Noni Madueke has left for Arsenal. Nkunku has
  struggled for form and fitness since joining from Leipzig for £52m two years
  ago and Bayern are pushing for a loan deal with an option to buy. Bayern are
  looking to strengthen their attack after releasing Thomas Müller, agreeing to
  sell Kingsley Coman and being hit by Jamal Musiala sustaining a long-term
  injury during the Club World Cup. They looked at Nkunku in January, but were
  put off by his £60m valuation. The Bundesliga champions have revived their
  interest after having a bid rejected for Stuttgart’s Nick Woltemade. Chelsea
  are also open to offers for Nicolas Jackson, who has interest from Newcastle,
  and Tyrique George. They are waiting for buyers to emerge for Raheem Sterling
  and Carney Chukwuemeka. Chelsea have rejected a loan bid from Borussia
  Dortmund for Chukwuemeka and an offer from Villarreal for the Portugal
  defender Renato Veiga Maresca wants a centre-back after losing Levi Colwill to
  a knee injury. The recruitment team are yet to activate any emergency plans
  and will move for defensive reinforcements only if a suitable player becomes
  available. Maresca, though, has made it clear he feels his squad does not
  contain a suitable replacement for Colwill. “You know how important Levi has
  been for us last season, for the way we want to play,” the head coach said
  before Sunday’s opening game at home to Crystal Palace. “We said many times we
  are able to create chances and to attack in the right way if we are able to
  build in the right way. Levi was a huge part of our buildup and now he’s out.
  “We are trying to find a solution internally, but the club know exactly what I
  think. We need a central defender.” Dominic Calvert-Lewin has completed his
  move to Leeds, whose manager, Daniel Farke, said the 28-year-old’s arrival
  would not end of the search for forwards. “There is no doubt we need
  reinforcements, especially in the offence,” he said. “Dominic can’t be the
  only step.” Calvert-Lewin, a free agent after leaving Everton, has signed a
  three-year deal.
