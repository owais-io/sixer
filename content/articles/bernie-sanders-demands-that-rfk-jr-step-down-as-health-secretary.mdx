  Bernie Sanders has joined in on growing public calls for Donald Trump’s health
  secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to resign, after recent chaos across US health
  agencies. In an op-ed published in the New York Times on Saturday, the Vermont
  senator accused Kennedy of “endangering the health of the American people now
  and into the future”, adding: “He must resign.” “Mr Kennedy and the rest of
  the Trump administration tell us, over and over, that they want to Make
  America Healthy Again. That’s a great slogan. I agree with it. The problem is
  that since coming into office President Trump and Mr Kennedy have done exactly
  the opposite,” Sanders wrote. Sanders pointed to the White House’s firing of
  Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
  as well as four other top CDC officials who resigned in protest this week
  after Monarez “refused to act as a rubber stamp” for Kennedy’s “dangerous
  policies”. “Despite the overwhelming opposition of the medical community,
  secretary Kennedy has continued his longstanding crusade against vaccines and
  his advocacy of conspiracy theories that have been rejected repeatedly by
  scientific experts,” Sanders wrote. “Against the overwhelming body of evidence
  within medicine and science, what are secretary Kennedy’s views? … He has
  absurdly claimed that ‘there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective’ … Who
  supports secretary Kennedy’s views? Not credible scientists and doctors. One
  of his leading ‘experts’ that he cites to back up his bogus claims on autism
  and vaccines had his medical license revoked and his study retracted from the
  medical journal that published it.” Sanders went on: “The reality is that
  secretary Kennedy has profited from and built a career on sowing mistrust in
  vaccines. Now, as head of [the Department of Health and Human Services] he is
  using his authority to launch a full-blown war on science, on public health
  and on truth itself.” Pointing to what he described as “our broken health care
  system”, Sanders said that Kennedy’s repeated attacks against science and
  vaccines will make it more difficult for Americans to obtain lifesaving
  vaccines. “Already, the Trump administration has effectively taken away Covid
  vaccines from many healthy younger adults and kids, unless they fight their
  way through our broken health care system. This means more doctor’s visits,
  more bureaucracy and more people paying higher out-of-pocket costs – if they
  can manage to get a vaccine at all,” he wrote. The senator warned that
  Kennedy’s next target may be the childhood immunization schedule, which
  involves a list of recommended vaccines for children to protect them from
  diseases including measles, chickenpox and polio. “The danger here is that
  diseases that have been virtually wiped out because of safe and effective
  vaccines will resurface and cause enormous harm,” Sanders said. In recent
  days, the Trump administration has faced rare bipartisan pushback following
  its firing of Monarez, which came amid steep budget cuts to the CDC’s work as
  well as growing concerns of political interference. Meanwhile, Kennedy has
  continued to make questionable medical and health claims – and has been
  lambasted in response by experts and lawmakers alike. Since he assumed
  leadership over the health department, Kennedy – a longtime anti-vaccine
  advocate – has fired health agency workers and entertained conspiracy
  theories. Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at US health
  agencies signed a letter in which they criticized Kennedy as an “existential
  threat to public health”. The health agency workers went on to accuse the
  health secretary of being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health
  infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading
  inaccurate health information”. The letter comes after a deadly shooting at
  the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, when a 30-year-old gunman
  fired more than 180 rounds into the buildings, killing a police officer before
  dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter had been struggling
  with mental health issues and was influenced by misinformation that led him to
  believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him sick, according to the gunman’s
  father.
