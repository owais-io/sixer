  Google’s new cheapest Pixel 10 has been upgraded with more cameras, a faster
  chip and some quality software that has brought it out of the shadow of its
  pricier Pro siblings to set a new standard of what you should expect from a
  base-model flagship phone. The regular Pixel 10 costs £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349)
  – the same as last year’s Pixel 9 – undercutting the 10 Pro by £200 and
  matching rivals from Samsung and Apple while offering more for your money. The
  design is almost identical to the Pixel 9, except for some new bold colours
  and the all-important new third camera in the pill-shaped lump on the back.
  The satin aluminium and glass body feels like a quality piece of hardware and
  the design certainly stands out in a sea of samey slab phones. The 6.3in OLED
  screen is crisp, super-bright and smooth with a 120Hz refresh rate. The glass
  back hides another upgrade: Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory
  support. Google is making its own Pixelsnap gadgets but Qi2 is an open
  standard and cross-compatible with the plethora of accessories designed for
  Apple’s excellent MagSafe, including chargers, wallets, handles and stands
  that just stick to the back of the phone. Specifications Screen: 6.3in 120Hz
  FHD+ OLED (422ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G5 RAM: 12GB Storage: 128 or 256GB
  Operating system: Android 16 Camera: 48MP+ 13MP UW + 10.8MP 5x tele; 10.5MP
  selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSim, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS Water
  resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm
  Weight: 204g Tensor G5 The new Tensor G5 chip is about 34-38% faster than
  Google’s previous top processor in testing, which is quite a leap for the
  brand, but still falls short of the raw performance of Qualcomm’s flagship
  Snapdragon chip used in rivals. The Pixel feels rapid in operation and will
  handle most things just fine. The battery life is solid if not class-leading.
  It manages roughly two days of light usage between charges or about 33 hours
  of heavy use, including five hours of 5G out and about with seven hours
  actively using the screen. Most people will need to charge it every other day.
  The Tensor G5 also includes a significantly faster AI processor that runs
  Google’s advanced AI quicker and handles more complex systems on-device,
  making the Pixel a showcase for Google’s AI prowess. Android 16 with AI The
  Pixel 10 runs the latest Android 16 out of the box and comes with software
  support until August 2032. Google’s take on Android is full of bold colours,
  big buttons and fun typography with plenty of nice touches and haptic
  interactions throughout the system. It’s a quality experience even if you
  choose more subtle colour combinations. The Pixel is a vehicle for some of
  Google’s most advanced AI systems, running the latest version of Gemini Nano
  on-device, which powers all sorts of AI features including various writing,
  dictation and image-editing tools. A flashy new voice translation system for
  phone calls can speak to you in a simulacrum of the caller’s voice, rather
  than one of the default Gemini voices. But Magic Cue is the most advanced new
  AI feature which runs locally on your phone and aims to be your little
  assistant running in the background on your device to proactively help you do
  things faster on your phone. It combines information from your Google account
  with multiple data sources on your phone to pop-up suggestions of useful
  information when using certain Google apps. For instance, it pulled up my
  order confirmation emails in a little card in the phone app when I called to
  check where my delivery was, giving me one-tap access to the order number. Or
  if someone texts about when your flight is due to land, it shows the time and
  date pulled from your calendar ready to send them with a single tap. The
  weather app suggests locations for your upcoming trips from your calendar,
  too. These things don’t sound particularly exciting, but are a step in the
  right direction for AI away from flashy gimmicks to useful little background
  time savers. Magic Cue currently works with Gmail, maps, calendar, Keep notes,
  screenshots, contacts and messages, with Google Photos and a few other Google
  apps coming soon. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t work in third-party
  apps yet, so if you use WhatsApp rather than text messages it can’t help you.
  Camera The Pixel 10 features a 10.5-megapixel selfie and three rear cameras: a
  48MP main, 13MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto. It addresses the main
  complaint about the base-model Pixel phones, which have lacked a telephoto
  cameras. The main and ultrawide cameras produce excellent images across a
  range of lighting conditions, doing better than rivals at this price in higher
  contrast scenes or dimmer indoor lighting. The new 5x telephoto significantly
  closes the distance to objects shooting great photos and reaching up to 20x
  digital zoom if needed. The photos from all three cameras show a little grain
  when viewed at full crop, but most will be very pleased with them. Google is
  still the best at reliably producing good images without much thought. The new
  auto Best Take mode improves on the popular group shot Best Take system by
  shooting multiple images to automatically blend them together for an image
  where everyone is looking at the camera. In most photos it won’t have to do
  too much, but the more people and the more complex the situation, the more the
  AI intervenes. The popular Add Me feature allows the photographer to be added
  in to larger and more complex group shots, and has been improved to support
  larger groups of people, more complex backgrounds and images of pets. The
  camera app also now adds C2PA content credentials to photos that show how the
  image was captured and whether generative AI was involved. One of the most
  overtly AI tools is the new Camera Coach feature, which uses Gemini to help
  you compose and frame a shot for a better picture. Press a small button at the
  top of the viewfinder and it sends the current view to Google’s servers to
  analyse and suggest several different possible compositions. Select the one
  you like the look of and it guides you through the steps of moving the camera,
  framing the shot and taking the photo. In testing, the suggestions were pretty
  good, so for anyone interested in improving their photography, this could be a
  low-key way of getting a bit of help. Overall, the Pixel 10 shoots great
  photos and videos with generally helpful AI additions, particularly with Best
  Take and Add Me, but it is possible you end up with images of a moment that
  may never have actually happened. Sustainability The battery is rated to last
  in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original
  capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair
  with manuals and parts available. The Pixel 10 is contains 32% recycled
  materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic,
  rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s
  environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free.
  Price The Google Pixel 10 costs from £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349) in a choice of
  four colours. For comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro costs from £999, the Pixel 9a
  costs £399, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £799 and the iPhone 16 costs £799.
  Verdict The Pixel 10 sets a new bar for base-model flagship phones, offering a
  high-quality experience and great camera with a meaningful telephoto zoom that
  doesn’t feel like a poor second cousin to the Pro models. The outside has not
  changed a lot since last year but it is an attractive design that stands out
  in the sea of rather samey phones, at least from the back. It feels snappy in
  operation, even if it doesn’t have the fastest chip available, and the battery
  lasts a decent 1.5 to two days between charges. Some of the new AI features
  actually seem like meaningful improvements, particularly Magic Cue, auto Best
  Take and other small bits that run locally in the background while you are
  doing things. Combined with Gemini, Google is leagues ahead in the era of
  actually useful AI tools compared with rivals such as Apple, and it doesn’t
  get in the way of the core smartphone experience. It is not quite the killer
  bargain of Google’s cheaper Pixel 9a but the Pixel 10 is one of the best
  phones you can get and great value nonetheless. Pros: seven years of software
  updates, great camera with 5x telephoto, great screen, Magic Cue and
  impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory
  support, good battery life, good size, fast fingerprint and face recognition.
  Cons: face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery
  life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US.
