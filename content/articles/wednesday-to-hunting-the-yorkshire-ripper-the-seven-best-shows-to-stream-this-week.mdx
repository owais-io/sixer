  Pick of the week Wednesday It’s a new term at Nevermore, and for the first
  time in her life, Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) is dying to go back to
  school. After all, she’s a minor celebrity now and dealing with autograph
  hunters (“I only ever sign my name in blood. I never said it was my own
  blood”). However, things are about to get much worse for Wednesday. Like every
  kid, she dreads the arrival of her family at school, but not only are her
  parents around more – her troublesome brother Pugsley and formidable
  grandmother Hester also soon become fixtures. Once again, it’s stylish, smart
  and witty. However you feel about Tim Burton, it’s hard to argue that his
  maximalist gothic style isn’t absolutely perfect for this material. Netflix,
  from Wednesday 6 August *** Hunting the Yorkshire Ripper The crimes of Peter
  Sutcliffe (and the flawed police investigation) have proved irresistible to
  documentary-makers, with the BBC and Netflix recently offering up versions of
  events. In truth, this latest series doesn’t add much to our understanding of
  Sutcliffe’s crimes, though it does broaden to examine the infamous “Wearside
  Jack” tape that was sent to police by a man claiming to be the killer. Former
  DCS Chris Gregg – who assembled a team to catch the hoaxer – is interviewed
  about his career-long involvement with the case. Prime Video, from Sunday 3
  August *** King of the Hill A lot has changed since 2009 when the last series
  of Mike Judge and Greg Daniels’s gently pointed animation launched. It returns
  with a question: can Hank and Peggy Hill still charm in America’s Trumpist
  turmoil? As it turns out, this reboot is perfectly judged. It’s full of tiny
  nods to the country’s troubled present but as ever, Hank is a modest, benign
  presence. He and Peggy have been living in Saudi Arabia but are retiring back
  to Texas. Hank kisses the ground after getting off the plane – but, from
  microbreweries to microaggressions, so much has changed. Disney+, from Monday
  4August *** The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder A third series for this
  accomplished animation that follows the exploits of the Prouds, an upwardly
  mobile African American family who mix cartoonish hijinks with strong,
  slightly earnest moral messaging about identity and hot-button social justice
  issues. Trudy is worried about screentime and it isn’t just her kids who can’t
  put down their phones – her husband Oscar is hardly setting a good example.
  Cue a decision to live more consciously and to take a family holiday to
  London, Paris and Nairobi that becomes life-changing for everyone involved.
  Apple TV+, from Wednesday 6 August *** Platonic The chemistry between Seth
  Rogen’s Will and Rose Byrne’s Sylvia continues to underwrite this profound
  comedy. The series doesn’t just tell us that deep, platonic friendships
  between men and women are possible – it shows us. It’s hard to avoid the
  feeling that Will and Sylvia have more fun together than with anyone else. And
  that’s the whole point: shouldn’t that be enough? As we return, Will is
  preparing to marry Jenna but admits to Sylvia that he has a crush on someone
  else. The fear that it might turn out to be Sylvia herself soon passes but,
  even so, is this another symptom of Will’s inability to commit to adult life?
  Apple TV+, from Wednesday 6 August *** House of Cats Most people would
  probably agree that the absence of a gameshow for cats and their owners is a
  glaring omission from the TV schedules. So thank goodness, finally, for House
  of Cats, a three-parter of snappy episodes which is hosted by comic Ivo Graham
  and social media personality, and qualified veterinary surgeon, Cat the Vet.
  Fittingly, there’s no hint of a cash prize here; instead the winning
  partnership will take home a golden litter tray. Given that cats are
  notoriously much harder to organise than dogs, they will have certainly earned
  it. Channel 4, from Thursday 7 August *** Promethea From Walter Presents, this
  daft but moderately creepy mystery drama from France stars Fantine Harduin as
  the titular teenager. When Promethea is hit by a car, she eventually wakes
  from a coma with no recollection of anything but her unusual name. Gradually,
  her memory starts to return but that proves to be a mixed blessing as a series
  of disturbing revelations about an unsolved recent murder start to spill out.
  At first, it seems that Promethea might have witnessed this killing – but
  could her involvement have been even more hands-on? Channel 4, from Friday 8
  August • This article was amended on 4 August 2025 to remove the documentary
  series Naming the Dead from this list, as a UK release date on Disney+ has yet
  to be confirmed.
