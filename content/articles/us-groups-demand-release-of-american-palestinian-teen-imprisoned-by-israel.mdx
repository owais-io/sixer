  More than one hundred US human rights, faith-based and civil rights groups
  have demanded that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, immediately secure the
  release of a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen who has been in an
  Israeli prison for six months over allegations of rock throwing. The
  coalition, which includes the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the
  Center for Constitutional Rights and Pax Christi USA, warned that Mohammed
  Zaher Ibrahim’s deteriorating health puts “his life on the line” and demanded
  urgent US intervention in the most significant organized pressure campaign on
  the imprisoned teenager’s case yet. “Mohammed is an American child with a
  community in Florida who cares about him deeply,” the organizations wrote. “It
  is the responsibility of the U.S. government to protect all American children,
  including Palestinian-Americans.” The ADC, one of the signers, also erected a
  billboard in New York’s Times Square earlier in August featuring Ibrahim’s
  photograph and the message “Free Mohammed Ibrahim”, describing him as a
  Palestinian American teenager “unjustly imprisoned by Israel”. The Guardian
  was first to report Ibrahim’s detention. The teen, who splits his time between
  Palm Bay, Florida, and the West Bank, was 15 when Israeli soldiers arrested
  him from his home in the West Bank in February. He has since developed
  scabies, according to state department emails to the family, and lost at least
  25lb, his lawyer says. The Guardian learned of his detention while
  investigating the death of Ibrahim’s cousin, Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old
  Palestinian-American allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July.
  The teenager is now being held at Israel’s Ofer prison, which the coalition
  described as notorious for abusing Palestinian children. He was previously
  detained at Megiddo prison, where a 17-year-old Palestinian teenager died in
  April from what advocates described as abusive conditions. “Mohammed traveled
  to his family’s home in the West Bank for a family vacation to see loved
  ones,” the letter reads. “The Israeli military took Mohammed when he was only
  15 years old, forcing him to spend his 16th birthday in an Israeli military
  prison, terrified and separated from his parents.” Military court documents
  seen by the Guardian show Israeli authorities accuse Mohammed of throwing
  rocks at Israeli vehicles in at least two separate incidents. At an August
  court hearing, his lawyer said Ibrahim needed medical care, with his next
  hearing scheduled for 29 October. The groups argue Ibrahim’s imprisonment
  violates the Fourth Geneva Convention’s prohibition on transferring detainees
  from occupied territory to the occupying power’s territory. He is among 323
  Palestinian children aged 12-17 currently held in Israeli military detention,
  according to Defense for Children International-Palestine. His father, Zaher
  Ibrahim, contacted Mike Haridopolos, a Republican congressman from Florida, in
  March after more than 45 days without contact with his son, casework filed
  with the lawmaker and seen by the Guardian shows. Haridopolos’s office
  confirmed it had shared the family’s information with the state department,
  which said the US embassy in Israel was “following standard procedures”. US
  embassy officials have conducted welfare checks on Ibrahim since his detention
  but faced restrictions in July after informing the family that Ibrahim was
  suffering from scabies and was receiving medical treatment, according to state
  department emails reviewed by the Guardian. It is unclear whether officials
  have resumed the welfare checks. The state department did not respond to a
  request for comment. The organized campaign represents an escalation in
  efforts to secure Ibrahim’s release after months of what advocates describe as
  inadequate government response to his detention. “Dozens of
  Palestinian-American families own land in the West Bank – Palestinian cities
  and villages that are increasingly being targeted by Israeli settlers and the
  Israeli military,” the groups wrote. “Yet, Palestinian-American families are
  not receiving any protection from the US government against rising Israeli
  settler and Israeli military violence against them.”
