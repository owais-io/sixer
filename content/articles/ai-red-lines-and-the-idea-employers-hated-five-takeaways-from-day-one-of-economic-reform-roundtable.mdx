  Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers have presided over the first day of the
  economic reform roundtable, with discussions focused on training, skills and
  worker mobility. The Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Michele Bullock, and
  a slew of bureaucrats, business leaders and trade unions took part in the
  opening sessions of the three-day event. The treasurer praised the quality and
  calibre of engagement as “outstanding”. “It’s been a really promising and
  productive first day,” Chalmers said. Here are five takeaways from day one of
  the event at Parliament House: Unions want business to pay for worker training
  Union leaders including the ACTU boss, Sally McManus, called for a new levy on
  business to pay for training for those workers who want to up skill for their
  jobs. The proposal would impose a 1.5% levy on businesses with a turnover of
  $500,000 or above. Employers hate the idea. The Business Council of Australia
  boss, Bran Black, said such new levies would be a backward step. He said the
  government should pay for incentives for trainee workers. “From a business
  perspective, we just don’t see that taxing the business community is the right
  way to deliver the outcomes that Australia needs,” Black said. The Australian
  Industry Group boss, Innes Willox, said the plan would hit more than 70,000
  Australian businesses and raise about $4.5bn. “We’ve done a training levy
  before in Australia, between 1990 and 1996. It didn’t work, it distorted the
  market,” he said. “The Productivity Commission said it was distortionary and
  it also adds to compliance costs.” Albanese open to big ideas The prime
  minister told attendees their work would feed in to next year’s federal
  budget, as well as the mid-year economic update expected just before
  Christmas. Despite dampening expectations of major reforms in areas such as
  tax, Albanese said longer term reform proposals and priorities were possible.
  He nominated AI as one area requiring a longer period of work. “I don’t expect
  that you will solve all of those issues in the next three days, but what you
  will have is ideas and input that will shape that agenda and … public
  discourse. 'Quick wins' needed on skills There could be an agreement to better
  recognise the skills and qualifications of those who have trained overseas.
  Willox said “millions of people” were in Australia doing jobs that were way
  below their skill level”. “There’s recognition that the system is jammed up.
  [There are] people who have qualifications that are not recognised, be that
  migrants or be that people trying to transfer between states or even … between
  occupations. “It’s really important we do get some quick wins.” Liam O’Brien,
  an assistant secretary at the ACTU, agreed that recognition of prior learning
  and the transfer of credit for previous qualifications was a “priority”. But
  hopes for a quick win look likely to be disappointed, after O’Brien said “the
  devil is in the detail”. “I think it is a very tricky one for us to resolve.”
  Workers should win from productivity gains too Jennifer Westacott, a former
  BCA boss and the chancellor of Western Sydney University, called for the
  benefits of productivity gains to be shared with workers. Speaking after
  taking part in a session on skills, development and mobility, she said
  business leaders wanted to reward workers who were doing a good job. “It’s
  about creating more value from what we do,” she told Guardian Australia.
  “There has to be a sense in which people feel that they’re getting the
  benefits. “The best way of sharing things is high wages and we can’t get
  started if we are not growing at a rate that allows us to expand the economy.”
  Westacott said households had weathered the cost-of-living crisis sparked by
  post-pandemic inflation but the next challenge was standards of living. “If
  you look at the last decade, we’ve seen the lowest rate of GDP per capita in
  the last six decades. That’s a red line.” AI dominating discussions AI was a
  major topic of conversation. “Something that was really positive, where there
  was a lot of agreement, was the sense that we do need to help the Australian
  community skill-up in terms of its confidence in using AI,” the independent MP
  Allegra Spender said. Barney Glover, the commissioner of Jobs and Skills
  Australia, recently described AI as a “foundational skill” that needed to be
  taught in schools. The JSA in a major report found that clerical roles were
  among a number of white collar occupations threatened by AI, but that the
  technology was more likely to augment jobs, rather than replace them. The
  transformative technology is sure to also loom large on day two of the
  roundtable, which will focus on productivity.
