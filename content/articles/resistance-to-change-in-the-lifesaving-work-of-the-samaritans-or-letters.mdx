  Unlike Peter Ormerod (I was a Samaritan – I love Samaritans. But for the sake
  of all who take those calls, it must change course, 29 July), I am a still
  Samaritan, and spent several hours last Tuesday on the phone to some extremely
  distressed callers. I did that from what was formerly the front bedroom of a
  ramshackle Edwardian terrace house, which has room for just two workstations.
  The words “call centre” have been widely used to depict the charity’s proposed
  shift to larger, more modern branches. I wonder how many readers who work in
  comfortable, modern offices housing 20 (or even more) desks would consider
  themselves marooned in an inhuman “call centre” (or “regional hub” as Ormerod
  labels them)? Because Ormerod is no longer a Samaritan, he perhaps has not had
  access to the FAQs for volunteers, which note that nobody will be asked to
  work on their own. As many readers will experience daily, digital technology
  allows teams to work together when they are not in the same physical space.
  Change is really hard. I worked for the Guardian in the 2000s, when it moved
  from a poorly converted old factory building in Farringdon to brand-new
  premises in King’s Cross (“the middle of nowhere”, as it was labelled by some
  staff); from holding back news stories for the next day’s paper, to publishing
  them first on the website; from keeping the tech team separate from the
  editorial team, to having them work alongside each other; and from
  air-freighting copies of the paper to countries where fewer than 100 copies
  per day were sold, to not doing that. All these changes were stoutly resisted,
  particularly by some (not all) longer-serving staff. I wonder how many of
  these changes would strike today’s Guardian staff as destructive of the spirit
  of the enterprise? Tim Brooks Great Bourton, Oxfordshire • Having read the
  article by Peter Ormerod, I have to confess that I felt panic. Many many years
  ago when I was a single mum with a baby, few friends and no family, I called
  the Samaritans in the middle of the night. I was not suicidal, but I did feel
  as if I could no longer cope, that I was breaking apart. Bless the woman that
  answered my call; she chatted to me for quite some time, was at no point
  judgmental and gave me strength to go on. Many years later, I was unemployed,
  so I volunteered at my local Samaritans, went through their training and
  shadowed existing staff. There is no way that volunteers should be asked to
  work from home. There may be some nights when the only calls you get are from
  troubled individuals seeking self-gratification, but it is possible that the
  next call you take will be from someone about to cut short their life, or
  maybe no one speaks but you can hear in the background awful sounds of abuse.
  Once that call has finished, you need to be with someone who can empathise
  with you and help you put it from your mind so you do not take it home with
  you. This cannot be done when working from home. Samaritans should not put
  volunteers’ own mental health at risk – it is hard enough as it is. Ilona
  Notley Norwich • I volunteered with the Samaritans for 12 years across two
  branches. I left on the day that I found myself getting too emotional about
  two consecutive calls. Up until then I had never left a branch with a call
  hanging over me. Any difficult call and you get to debrief with the other
  Samaritans on your shift. This was essential, talking to a real person, face
  to face over a cup of tea, in a private room. I met and chatted with Chad
  Varah, the Samaritans founder, in a dinner queue at a conference. He was
  impressed that I was a younger volunteer; I was impressed with the way he was
  still a slight irritant to the then “management”. His attitude that you should
  never put the phone down on callers – even sex callers – was correct. My
  fellow volunteer, Karen, said she had never put the phone down on anyone: she
  just treated them like any other caller in crisis and either they would put
  the phone down on her in frustration; or, as frequently happened, they turned
  into genuine callers – men (it was nearly always men) who were lonely,
  unloved, sad. I gave talks to a variety of organisations and schools about
  what we did. I was keen to encourage more transparency about the Samaritans
  (the thinking then was that you should not tell people you were a Samaritan in
  case a caller called up and got you, someone they recognised). This decision
  to close branches in favour of remote working is shortsighted. I think I
  should still be worried about the management even now. I’m sure Chad would be
  thinking the same. Colin Kerrigan Haslemere, Surrey • I have volunteered for
  Citizens Advice for many years in several small offices at several different
  times in my life. I am retired now, have skills and experience to offer, would
  dearly like to use them again for Citizens Advice but the only options are to
  work in a large noisy impersonal phone hub or to take calls from home. Neither
  are possible for me – the former is too distant and too noisy and stressful,
  the latter is emotionally terrifying. So Citizens Advice has lost me.
  Samaritans will lose many like me if it follows its current plans. Cathy Hill
