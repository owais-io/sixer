  It was famously something that Tony Blair did not do with George W Bush, or at
  least not something to which the then British prime minister wished to admit.
  But these are very different times. When the US vice-president, JD Vance, and
  his family join David Lammy at the foreign secretary’s grace and favour home
  in Kent at the start of their summer holiday in the UK, they are expected to
  deepen their relationship by praying together, it is understood. Within the
  grounds of Chevening lies the pretty 12th-century St Botolph’s church. It is
  Anglican but, security risks and denominational differences aside, it may
  present one option for a place to take communion, sources suggested. Vance is
  a Catholic and Lammy has described his faith as Anglo-Catholic. The two men
  previously took mass in Vance’s residence in Washington when the
  vice-president hosted Lammy and his family in March. The burgeoning
  relationship between the two men, freshly evidenced by word that they will
  spend time together before the Vances head to the Cotswolds, may surprise
  some. As a backbencher, Lammy described Donald Trump as “a woman-hating,
  neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”. Now, Trump is “someone that we can build a
  relationship with” and Vance is a “friend”. The philosophy behind Lammy’s
  foreign policy has been described as “progressive realism” – taking the world
  as it is and not as we might wish it to be. Sceptics might be temped to
  describe such a pivot in different terms but the outcomes were difficult to
  argue with, said Michael Martins, formerly a political specialist in the US
  embassy in London and founder of the consultancy firm Overton Advisory. “I
  think they have done a pretty good job and you can see it with some of the
  incoming tariff increases which have not affected the UK as they have with
  other trading partners, like Canada,” Martins said. “I think it is paying off.
  I think President Trump’s view on Putin and Russia has changed, is changing
  and softening, in a way that I think the British government has been pushing
  for. I think the dividends from the relationship building are starting to
  come.” Lammy, a touchy-feely sort of politician, targeted Vance for a full
  charm offensive early on, when Labour was in opposition and Trump’s
  re-election was far from certain, sources said. The then shadow foreign
  secretary had a significant obstacle to overcome: Lammy has been a friend of
  Barack Obama since they met at a 2005 gathering of Harvard Law School’s black
  alumni. Such was the love-in that Lammy’s wife, Nicola Green, an artist, was
  given “unprecedented access” to chronicle Obama’s 2008 campaign. It was this
  political and personal relationship that has been front and centre of every US
  newspaper profile of Lammy in recent times. “A Friend of Obama Who Could Soon
  Share the World Stage With Trump” was the New York Times headline last April.
  Lammy had a further card to play. He has spoken about how Vance’s bestselling
  memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, bore parallels to his own story of growing up with a
  single mother and an absent, alcoholic father. Lammy has said Vance’s book
  “reduced me to tears”. “I said to JD: ‘Look, we’ve got different politics, but
  we’re both quite strong Christians and we both share quite a tough
  upbringing,’” Lammy said of an early meeting. He recently elaborated in an
  interview with the Guardian. During drinks with Vance and the deputy Labour
  leader, Angela Rayner, in the US ambassador’s residence at the time of the new
  pope’s inauguration, Lammy had an epiphany. It struck him that they were “not
  just working-class politicians, but people with dysfunctional childhoods”, he
  said. “I had this great sense that JD completely relates to me and he
  completely relates to Angela.” Donjeta Miftari, a former foreign policy
  adviser to Keir Starmer in Downing Street who is now a director at Hanbury
  Strategy, said: “David is an incredibly pragmatic person and he likes to take
  the world as it is. Frankly, you don’t have influence over which populations
  elect certain individuals in the country.” Lammy had had a gut feeling that
  the Republicans would win the White House back, she said, and he worked for
  “years, not months” on building the necessary relationships. “I’ve known him
  for a few years now, and I’d say that he is also, just on a personal level,
  one of the most empathetic and relational kind of MPs and politicians,” she
  said. “You know, in the early days of opposition and in government, I think he
  had a strong sense of where the US was going, and that is grounded in the fact
  that he studied out there, lived out there. He knows America well and it’s a
  big part of who he is. “So I think he sort of clocked basically that that is
  the direction in which the country was going so built these relationships well
  before they came to power in the US. And I think that gives it, like, extra
  kind of credibility and authenticity as well, because you’re not just calling
  them when you need them when you’re both in post. He’s an incredibly effective
  operator. Frankly, he’s quite good company as well, which always helps.” There
  will be a formal bilateral meeting between the two politicians before Vance’s
  wife, Usha, and their three children join Lammy, his wife and their children
  for the weekend. After their stay with the Lammys, the Vances are understood
  to be heading to a Cotswolds period property near Charlbury, about 12 miles
  (19km) north-west of Oxford. Martins, who was working in the US embassy at the
  time of Trump’s first state visit, said he recalled the delight that the
  president took in the pomp and ceremony. “I think vice-president Vance has to
  walk a bit of a delicate line,” he said. “Obviously he is angling for his own
  White House bid at the end of the Trump presidency. You know, I think he has
  to be careful not to appear as the primary recipient of international
  flattery.”
