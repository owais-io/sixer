  A Reform council leader’s decision to ban his councillors from engaging with a
  prominent local newspaper is a “massive attack on local democracy” and a sign
  of things to come should the party form the next government, the outlet’s
  editor has warned. In an unprecedented move, Nottinghamshire county council’s
  four-month-old Reform administration has said it will no longer deal with the
  Nottingham Post, its online edition and a team of BBC-funded local democracy
  journalists that it manages. Nigel Farage is already facing calls to intervene
  in the row, with local MPs accusing Reform of “rank hypocrisy” over its
  previous claims to support free speech and transparency. Lee Anderson, the
  Reform MP for Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, has said he will join in the boycott.
  In an interview with the Guardian, Natalie Fahy, the editor of the Nottingham
  Post and Nottinghamshire Live, said the ban had come from Mick Barton, the
  county council’s leader, after a story about plans for a restructuring of
  local government. She said it was a worrying sign of Reform’s approach to the
  free press. “It’s a massive attack on local democracy,” she said. “I’ve been a
  journalist for 20 years. We have had our ups and downs with all kinds of
  councils. We managed to get along fine, because most elected officials accept
  this is par for the course. You are going to get some negative press. What you
  don’t do is shut the shop up. “This is a worrying sign of potentially things
  to come if Reform wins the next election. What you’re seeing here in
  Nottinghamshire is probably a microcosm of how it will be across the whole of
  the UK if Nigel Farage becomes prime minister. You are just going to see this
  kind of shutting down of questioning. “They need to be answerable to the
  people who elected them. We don’t take a political stance. We’re not
  anti-Reform. We’re just trying to find out what’s going on.” The move has
  already caused concern among other parties. The Lib Dems have written to
  Farage to demand that he step in to reverse the “dangerous and chilling”
  decision. They also suggested that the move may have breached local
  government’s code of conduct, which calls on elected officials to “submit
  themselves to the scrutiny”. The row in Nottinghamshire has been rumbling
  since a clip of an interview in June with a local councillor, in which they
  appeared to have only a loose grasp of their brief, went viral online.
  Relations appeared to improve and Reform figures were engaging with the local
  reporters. However, Barton cut access after raising objections to a story
  examining plans for a reorganisation of local government, which included
  alleged disagreements within the Reform group of councillors. Under the ban,
  none of the 41 Reform councillors will speak to Nottinghamshire Live and local
  democracy reporters. The outlet has been told press officers have also been
  instructed to take Nottinghamshire Live off council media distribution lists,
  meaning it will not receive some press releases or be invited to events.
  Editors have been informed that the only time they will be able to receive a
  statement from a Reform councillor is in an emergency situation, such as
  flooding or an incident at a council-run school. Michael Payne, the Labour MP
  for Gedling, accused Reform of “rank hypocrisy” over the ban. “Reform told us
  throughout the election, and continues to tell us, that they’re the party of
  free speech and transparency,” he said. “But it’s clear from this decision in
  Nottinghamshire that free speech and transparency only applies to everybody
  else and not to themselves.” Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham
  East, said the move “sets a chilling precedent”, adding: “The party claims to
  be in favour of free speech but is yet again showing its true, authoritarian
  colours.” Jo White, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said it amounted to a
  “shutting down of democracy”. Steve Yemm, the Labour MP for Mansfield, said:
  “Refusing to speak to your local paper is not how you build trust. It’s how
  you hide.” Reform UK declined to comment. Barton has been contacted for
  comment.
