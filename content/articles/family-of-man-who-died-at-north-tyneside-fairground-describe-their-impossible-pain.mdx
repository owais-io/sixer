  The family of Corrie Lee Stavers, who has died while working on a fairground
  ride in North Tyneside, have issued a statement describing the “impossible”
  pain of their loss. Stavers, 28, suffered “serious head injuries” in what
  Northumbria police described as a “workplace accident” at the Spanish City
  Summer Funfair in Whitley Bay on Saturday afternoon. He was treated at the
  scene by the emergency services, which were alerted at 2.15pm, but was
  declared dead shortly afterwards. The Health and Safety Executive has been
  informed and is assisting in the investigation to establish what happened,
  police said. Stavers, who police said is originally from the Sunderland area,
  was described as “our beloved Corrie” by his family. In a statement, they
  said: “It’s with broken hearts that we share the devastating news that our
  beloved Corrie has passed away. “He was tragically taken from us in an
  accident while working on a fairground ride. None of us were prepared for
  this, and the pain of losing him so suddenly is impossible to put into words.
  “Our lives will never be the same without him, but his memory will live on in
  our hearts for ever. “We love you endlessly, Corrie, and we miss you more than
  words can ever say. You’re with our mam now – rest in peace Corrie.” The
  family, who are being supported by specialist officers, have asked for
  privacy. On Facebook, a spokesperson for Turners Funfairs and Spanish City
  Funfairs posted that they were “heartbroken” that a “much loved colleague” had
  died in the “tragic accident”. They added: “Our team is like a family and we
  are all deeply affected by this loss. As a mark of respect, Spanish City
  Funfair will remain closed this weekend, while we take the time to grieve
  together.” Northumbria police said anyone with information on the incident
  could contact officers by sending them a direct message on social media, or by
  using the live chat or report-form functions on the force’s website. The
  police spokesperson added: “Our thoughts are with the man’s family at this
  extremely difficult time.”
