  This time of the year is typically the busy booking season for Sam Enticknap,
  a makeup artist based in Margaret River, Western Australia. But the phone has
  stopped ringing since her Instagram account, which had 48,000 followers, was
  suspended without notice by Meta three weeks ago. “I received a horrible email
  saying a reference to child sexual exploitation content, which obviously was
  quite traumatic to see,” she said. “Saying my Instagram accounts have been
  disabled with just no clear explanation.” Enticknap estimates that, as a
  result of her account being wrongly suspended, she has lost 80% of the
  bookings she otherwise would have leading into the busy wedding season in
  Margaret River. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “A lot of people come through
  Instagram, they find hashtags and they find word of mouth, and obviously
  through other businesses that always tag us,” she said. Enticknap said it made
  her realise how reliant she was on Meta for business. She said she lost two
  Instagram accounts and a Facebook account as a result of the permanent
  suspension, and said attempts to contact the company to have the ban appealed
  had resulted in a “dead end”. She said she was not alone, citing another WA
  business – which sells artificial flowers – which had been suspended from Meta
  platforms and received the same reference to child sexual exploitation. “My
  friend who has another successful makeup business, she went down the week
  after me, but she’s managed to get her account back,” Enticknap said.
  Incorrect account suspensions on social media platforms are not a new
  phenomenon. Often when Meta is asked by media about an account, it is later
  restored. However, something changed in July. A flood of emails were sent to
  journalists from people all over the world saying that, without warning, their
  Facebook and Instagram accounts had been suspended. Many were told –
  erroneously – by Meta that their accounts had been suspended for breaching
  community standards on child sexual exploitation, abuse and nudity. Users
  report Meta has typically been unresponsive to their pleas for assistance,
  often with standardised responses to requests for review, almost all of which
  have been rejected. There are petitions with tens of thousands of signatures,
  a subreddit devoted to people who have had their accounts disabled and talk of
  a class action against Meta over the bans. From around a dozen emails received
  in the past two weeks, Guardian Australia has reported five accounts –
  including Enticknap’s – to Meta, which said it had internally escalated the
  investigation of those accounts. Media reporting of the plight of businesses
  struggling as a result of their Instagram ban has led to many of those
  accounts being restored. But the company claims there has not been an increase
  in incorrect account suspension, and the volume of users complaining was not
  indicative of new targeting or over-enforcement. “We take action on accounts
  that violate our policies, and people can appeal if they think we’ve made a
  mistake,” a spokesperson for Meta said. Meta is reliant on a mix of human
  reports and automation to find and remove accounts in breach of its rules. The
  company publishes data on how many accounts it removes – and data on how many
  it subsequently restores – in its quarterly community standards enforcement
  report. However, the latest report only covers to the end of March, so it
  can’t yet be judged whether the company has had a significant uptick in
  removed accounts or appeals. For Enticknap, the suspension carries an
  emotional weight. Her father died this year, and the photos and messages her
  father uploaded to Facebook cannot be accessed. “I’ve tried to message and
  just say: ‘Can I just get my data? Can I just get that? Shut me down, but let
  me get those pictures back’,” she said. “But nothing. I’ve not had any reply.”
