  What’s the most important thing when you’re spending hours sitting in front of
  a computer? Is it having the fastest internet? The sharpest screen? The
  perfect keyboard? No. When you’re spending most of your day sitting on your
  bottom, the most crucial element is what’s directly underneath. With a good
  office chair, you can handle a long working day without any feelings of
  discomfort. With a bad one, you can expect backache, neck ache, tender glutes
  and assorted nagging pains. Who wants to return to work when the last day left
  you feeling achy and decrepit? Many decent chairs are available, and while you
  don’t want to go cheap, you also don’t have to spend a fortune. I’ve spent the
  past three months trying six of the best office chairs – including some
  lower-cost alternatives – to help you make a better choice. *** At a glance
  Best office chair overall: Slouch Task One From £289 (with arms) at Slouch
  Best budget office chair: Habitat Beck £95 at Argos Best for all-day comfort:
  Herman Miller Aeron From £1,385 at Herman Miller Best for style: Ikea
  Hattefjäll From £199 at Ikea *** Why you should trust me I’m a hard-working
  writer who spends long days (and often nights) sitting at a desk. I’m prone to
  spending even more time at my desk after working hours, playing video games
  and working on personal projects. Basically, I’m a world-class endurance
  sitter, and I demand a lot from my office chair. I’m also an experienced
  reviewer, covering consumer technology, PC hardware, ergonomic office
  accessories and a wide range of home and garden products. I’ve got a strong
  idea of what works, what is going to drive you crazy, and what you need to
  think about before you buy. How I tested I’d like to say I spent hours running
  automated pressure and wear simulations, but in truth, I simply spent a lot of
  time sitting on each chair. I assembled each model where assembly was
  required, noting any issues with the process, the supplied instructions and
  the fixtures and fittings provided. I then spent up to a fortnight using each
  as my everyday office chair, sitting in blocks of up to five hours, two or
  three times a day. I also roped in my wife for further testing. She’s a
  freelance illustrator and similarly inclined to spending long days at her
  desk. We rotated the chairs between us, occasionally bickering over who got to
  sit in the most comfortable option and who would be hit with the chair with
  the immovable backrest and less cushioning. I also put each office chair’s
  adjustments through their paces to see what could and couldn’t be moved,
  checked for safety issues and noted any mechanisms that didn’t feel built to
  last. When we’d finished with a chair, it was dispatched back to the
  manufacturer, or a branch of Devon charity Hospiscare, so that it could go on
  living a useful life at someone else’s desk. *** The best office chairs in
  2025 *** Best office chair overall: Slouch Task One From £289 (with arms) at
  Slouch The Slouch Task One may not have the wow factor of the Herman Miller
  Aeron featured below, but it still gives you everything you’d want from an
  office chair. It comes unassembled, but can be put together in 20 minutes
  because of clear instructions, complete with videos to help. Once assembled,
  it feels solid, with none of the cheap plastics or creaky fittings found on
  the budget chairs. It looks good, too, in a choice of black or light grey for
  the frame and seats in beige, charcoal, pink, light grey and blue. Most
  importantly, it’s hugely comfortable, making light work of even the most epic
  working days. Why we love it Slouch has got the seat spot on, with enough
  padding to keep your posterior from encountering any hard surfaces, and a
  moulded shape that holds up well under pressure. The mesh backrest keeps the
  spine upright while allowing for a degree of tilt, with a four-stage lock and
  synchronised mechanism to keep you balanced. Just about everything is
  adjustable, from the seat height and depth to the tension of the backrest, the
  height and position of the arms and the placement of the lumbar support. The
  gas lift has a smooth action that makes it easy to get the height right.
  Slouch also offers the chair with a choice of casters, covering soft and hard
  floors (though there is an additional cost of £19 for the hard floor option).
  It’s a shame that … you have to pay £39 extra if you want a forward seat-tilt
  mechanism, although it’s still a bargain compared with most other chairs. Some
  may hanker for more padding on the soft-feel armrests or find the colour
  options bland. Dimensions: 70 x 65 x 108cm Seat depth and height: 42-48cm;
  42-54cm Adjustments: seat depth, seat height, arm height and position,
  back-tilt tension, lumbar support *** Best budget office chair: Habitat Beck
  £95 at Argos Habitat’s chair does a good job of fitting into your average
  home-office setup. It’s compact and attractive, with a white frame, a pink
  mesh backrest and a sunny light orange seat. Clear instructions make it easy
  to assemble – I had it ready within 15 minutes – and it feels solid once
  that’s done. There are, sadly, no adjustments for the back or arm rests, but
  the seat height can rise from 44cm to 52cm, and it tilts backwards and
  forwards as you move. Why we love it It’s less than £100, but the Beck looks
  and feels like a more expensive chair. The seat has better cushioning than
  you’ll find on other budget options, and it’s neither too soft nor too firm.
  You may want more support from below for all-day working, but it’s fine for a
  few hours here and there. The tilt mechanism is also more responsive than on
  some cheap models, though the fixed back means you don’t get the same
  flexibility as on the Slouch, Herman Miller and Ikea chairs. The Beck is a
  great chair for slouching at your desk while you’re engaged in deep thought or
  otherwise procrastinating, but not so great when you’re sitting up and trying
  to get work done. The backrest feels slanted backwards, suggesting a relaxed
  posture rather than the more ergonomic vertical stance. It’s a shame that …
  the back isn’t adjustable, and neither is the seat depth or the height of the
  armrests, so you’re stuck with what you’ve got. If it were my own money, I’d
  really try to find the extra to get the Slouch. Dimensions: 65 x 60x 92cm Seat
  depth and height: 48cm; 44-52cm Adjustments: seat height, back-tilt tension,
  tilt lock *** Best for all-day comfort: Herman Miller Aeron From £1,385 at
  Herman Miller £1,399 at John Lewis The Aeron is a high-end office design
  classic, and you only need to sit on one for an hour or two to understand why.
  Counterintuitively, the mesh seat is gentler on the glutes than any
  conventional padded effort, sloping down and curving off to support your
  thighs at just the right angle without digging in behind the knee. You can’t
  even feel the hard plastic edge at the front, which is where so many copycats
  fall down. It looks and feels like the seating equivalent of an executive
  saloon car, mixing tough plastics with the occasional bit of chrome. Why we
  love it It comes already built, so there’s no pain there, and it’s incredibly
  adjustable. It’s the only chair where I needed to refer to the instructions to
  figure out all the controls. However, once you spend an hour or so tweaking
  all the heights, depths and angles, it fits the body like a glove,
  effortlessly tilting forwards and backwards in perfect synchronisation as you
  move. If you absolutely have to spend long days and nights beavering away to
  hit a deadline, this is the chair to do it in. While getting up to move and
  stretch is recommended, your back and neck won’t be accusing you of torture
  when you do finally get away. Make sure you buy it in the right size, with
  smaller and larger A and C options as well as the standard B fit. It’s a shame
  that … it’s big and heavy, so best for an established office space; you don’t
  want to lug this big galoot around. Really, though, the only reason not to buy
  it is the price. It’s arguably worth it even so, but it is a serious
  investment. Dimensions (size B): 66 x 60 x 109cm Seat depth and height: 46cm;
  45-58cm Adjustments: seat height, arm height and position, back-tilt tension,
  tilt limiter, lumbar support *** Best for style: Ikea Hattefjäll From £199 at
  Ikea With its elegant frame, sleek seat and backrest and choice of tasteful
  fabrics, the Hattefjäll brings a touch of Scandinavian style into the office.
  You’ll feel like you’re working at an upmarket consultancy, even when you’re
  sitting in your faded T-shirt and jogging bottoms because you haven’t got a
  video call that day. Why we love it As with pricier chairs, it has a
  synchronised tilt mechanism, so you can shift backwards and forwards to keep
  the body moving, and the casters lock in place when there’s no weight on the
  chair, so it won’t skid around when you sit down or stand up. The Hattefjäll
  is more than just a great-looking chair; it also has a strong set of features
  for the price. The backrest is adjustable to five different heights, and you
  can tweak the seat depth and the lumbar support. The armrests are height- and
  width-adjustable, reducing strain on the shoulders, and you can lock the tilt
  to avoid excessive slouching. It’s among the most ergonomic options at this
  price. It’s a shame that … the levers to adjust the height and tilt are a bit
  too small for comfort, making these adjustments tricky. I also had a serious
  problem with assembly. The arms attach with bolts that screw into a slit in
  the fabric of the seat, but these were a nightmare to align, and one bolt
  refused to screw cleanly into place. Yet the long-term issue here is a seat
  that’s thin and firm, which I found uncomfortable as I neared the end of every
  day. Do our Swedish friends have something against cushioning? Dimensions: 68
  x 68 x 114cm Seat depth and height: 40cm; 46-56cm Adjustments: seat height,
  seat depth, arm height and position, backrest height, back-tilt tension, tilt
  lock, lumbar support *** The best of the rest *** Dunelm Archie £48.30 at
  Dunelm Best for: a very low budget The Archie is affordable for a mesh-backed
  office chair, but you lose a lot in terms of flexibility. The backrest bolts
  on to the arms, meaning neither can be adjusted, and there’s no way to move
  the lumbar support up and down. I found the backrest solid and supportive, but
  if you’re taller or shorter than average, you may find the lumbar support in
  the wrong place. On the plus side, I found this chair easy to assemble with
  straightforward instructions, and it’s relatively comfortable if you’re
  sitting for only an hour or two. You can tilt backwards and forwards to shift
  your spine around, with an adjustable tension knob and a handy lock on the
  height adjustment lever. It didn’t make the final cut because … there’s just
  not enough padding on the seat, and the foam used doesn’t do a great job of
  holding its shape under pressure. After a few hours, you can feel the stiff
  board underneath the seat from your bottom to your lower thigh. I managed to
  spend more than a week with the Archie as my main office chair, but only
  because I had a memory foam cushion I could stick on top. Dimensions: 61 x 60
  x 102cm; seat depth and height: 46cm; 44-56cm adjustments: seat height,
  back-tilt tension, tilt lock. *** T-Three office chair £38.99 at Amazon Best
  for: a cheap desk chair for occasional use It’s no mystery how this chair can
  be found at such an astoundingly low price. Everything inside the box needs to
  be assembled, including the base, involving 30 slightly agonising minutes of
  Allen-key action before you get a chance to sit down. The arms and backrest
  are fixed in place, as is the lumbar support, and while you can tilt forwards
  and backwards, the chair creaks and groans if you push it too far. Despite
  this, I found the chair surprisingly comfortable for short periods. The arms
  felt too low to keep my shoulders level while typing, though – a problem when
  there’s no way to shift them up or down. It didn’t make the final cut because
  … of its insufficient padding, with the seat feeling brutally hard and
  unforgiving within the space of three or four hours. I might consider it as a
  desk chair for lightweight offspring or for occasional evening use, but you
  need to spend more if you work from home. Dimensions: 59 x 46 x 100cm; seat
  depth and height: 46cm, 45-55cm; adjustments: seat height, back-tilt tension,
  tilt lock *** What you need to know *** How to choose the right office chair
  Looks are important, but what’s vital is that an office chair is comfortable.
  And that’s not just what you feel when you first sit down, but how it supports
  your body and posture over longer periods. Ideally, you should be able to
  adjust the chair so that you can sit with your feet flat close to the desk,
  with your thighs close to horizontal and your back vertical and straight. Your
  arms should be able to sit parallel to the desk and be supported by the
  armrests. Chairs that help you achieve this working posture will be more
  comfortable when you’re sitting in them for most of the day. This is what
  makes adjustments so important. The more you can move the backrest, the arms,
  the seat and any lumbar support, the better chance you have of finding the
  right fit. Design Beyond that, the design and structure of the seat and
  backrest make a difference. Foam backrests can be solid and supportive, but
  they can affect your posture if they’re too soft. Mesh backrests are usually
  cooler in the summer, while still providing plenty of support. The seat will
  always be subjective, but you want enough cushioning to relieve pressure on
  your thighs and buttocks, without it being so soft that your posture suffers
  or you can feel any hard surfaces below. Look out for hard surfaces near the
  front or edges that might end up digging in an inch or two behind the knees.
  Tilt Some degree of tilt is great. It means you can push back in your seat and
  rest for a minute, and that the chair will support you as you shift around.
  However, there needs to be control if you want to adopt a better posture while
  you’re working. The best office chairs offer a synchronised tilt, where the
  seat and backrest tilt independently, but still move in unison to support you
  as you move. A degree of forward tilt can also be useful if you want to avoid
  pressure behind the knees. Safety Watch out for safety aspects of the design.
  Office chairs have to conform to British standards for fire resistance, but
  it’s also worth checking for rough edges or sharp points that may poke you as
  you move around your workspace, and for any mechanisms that might trap a
  finger while you’re leaning back. Don’t go cheap on a chair you’re going to
  spend a lot of time in; you’ll regret it later on. *** Stuart Andrews is a
