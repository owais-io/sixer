  A few months ago, something changed. One minute, people were trudging along as
  usual; the next it seemed like every third person I passed on the street was
  wearing a weird, heavy little backpack. Initially, I mistook several of these
  bulky, menacing items for bulletproof vests. (Scary.) Eventually, I realized
  they were simply the latest fitness trend: weighted vests. Celebrities have
  been sporting them on walks, Peloton instructors are making videos explaining
  how to use them, and influencers are peddling them on TikTok. Publications
  have written about their growing popularity among “the menopause set”, as
  Allure put it, because of their supposed ability to help with muscle strength
  and bone density as one ages. “It really has gotten so much attention lately,”
  says Dr Elaina Manolis, a physical therapist and clinical professor at
  Northeastern University. The practice used to be called “rucking”, she notes,
  because people would walk with heavy rucksacks. One reason for this spike is
  that the vests don’t look so much like bulky backpacks anymore, Manolis
  suspects: “They’re sleek and cute,” she says. She also believes it’s part of a
  bigger societal trend. “Culture has shifted so much for the positive in
  women’s health, and in understanding the importance of strength training and
  bone density,” she says. So are weighted vests the miracle workout upgrade
  some claim? I tried one for two weeks, and asked experts for advice. What is a
  weighted vest? They are vests that are weighed down with iron sand or small
  weights. “They can be thought of as ‘hyper-gravity’,” says Dr Abbi Lane,
  assistant professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan.
  “They add a little bit more weight and resistance.” Typically, they weigh
  anywhere from five to 30lbs (2.26 to 13.6kg), and are worn across the
  shoulders and upper torso. Some are small, with straps across the chest.
  Others are bigger, cover most of the torso and look disconcertingly like
  bulletproof vests. “Start with a vest that’s no more than five to 10% of your
  body weight, and build from there,” says Dr Mary Claire Haver,
  obstetrician-gynecologist and medical advisory board member of Let’s Talk
  Menopause. I ordered a 16lb (7.25 kg) vest by a brand called Prodigen that
  seemed relatively comfortable and wouldn’t make me look like I was on my way
  to a gun range. How do you use a weighted vest? Weighted vests are different
  to other equipment in that they can be worn pretty much anywhere and at any
  time. “Whereas you might do resistance training in a gym for 30 minutes twice
  a week, you could put on the weighted vest during other activities,” says
  Lane. It’s still best to limit one’s use though, especially in the beginning.
  “I don’t recommend it for everyday use,” says Manolis. Most daily tasks
  involve a lot of bending and stretching, and adding weight raises the risk of
  injury. Manolis recommends wearing a vest when walking – which she calls “a
  very underrated exercise as it is” – because you are in an upright posture and
  the potential for injury is much lower. If you are confident in the vest, you
  can also use it for “light aerobics, strength training and even short bouts of
  running”, says Haver. Make sure your joints can tolerate the load though.
  Start by wearing the vest for a short period of time, then build up. “Aim for
  20-30 minutes a day, and listen to your body,” says Haver. What does a
  weighted vest feel like? Twice a week, for two weeks, I wore my vest for my
  current favorite physical activity: walking on the treadmill in the air
  conditioned gym while watching Vera on my iPad. When I first strapped it on,
  the vest felt heavy but oddly comforting – like a thunder shirt for dogs. As I
  started walking, I was surprised by how off-balance I felt. It took me a few
  minutes to find my stride, and holding myself upright and centered required
  more core strength than I had expected. By the time my 30 minutes was up, DCI
  Vera Stanhope had realized that all was not as it seemed in her murder case,
  and I was breathing noticeably harder than usual. Why did it feel more
  challenging? I have previously weighed 16lbs more than I do now, and I don’t
  recall feeling more tired when I walked. When you wear a vest, “the weight is
  not distributed throughout the body,” explains Lane. “When I was 16lbs
  heavier, my legs and arms were bigger too. When you have the vest, it’s all in
  one place and you have to adjust your center of mass,” she says. This
  challenges your balance, but it’s important that the vest not be so heavy that
  it requires you to significantly change your gait. “That’s how injuries can
  happen,” she says. Over time, I felt less off-kilter when I wore the vest. My
  walks felt more intense than usual, but not unpleasant. What are the benefits
  of wearing a weighted vest? Weighing down your body with a weighted vest has a
  number of benefits, says Manolis. When your body is heavier, moving requires
  more muscle, she explains. And over time, as more muscle develops, strength
  improves. The greater weight will also require more energy to move, and thus
  your body will burn more calories. Some research shows that long-term use of
  weighted vests can prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women, a population
  particularly at risk for low bone density and resulting conditions like
  osteopenia and osteoporosis. Manolis suggests that this may be because the
  added top-down pressure that a vest places on one’s skeletal system can
  improve how quickly bones repair themselves. Most studies on weighted vests
  and bone density have been small though, warns Lane – fewer than 20 people.
  The biggest study on the topic had 150 participants. The one-year, randomized
  control trial explored whether exercising with a weighted vest could offset
  bone loss in older adults who were trying to lose weight. It did not. “The
  research here is not super fleshed out yet,” Lane says. The flexibility and
  affordability of weighted vests mean they can still be a useful piece of
  equipment. “We’re finally talking about muscle and bone loss in midlife
  women,” says Haver. “And weighted vests are a simple, affordable way to help
  combat that.” Ideally though, they would be used in conjunction with other
  forms of cardio and strength training. “I think of things like weighted vests
  as the cherry on top,” says Lane. “Potentially beneficial, but nothing
  replaces aerobic and resistance exercise.” What are the risks of wearing a
  weighted vest? The greatest risks come from wearing a vest that is too heavy,
  or wearing one for too long. “It can cause joint strain, poor posture, or even
  back or knee pain,” says Haver. Proper fit and gradual progression are key,
  she says. And if you ever feel discomfort, stop. “Don’t push through pain,”
  she warns. Verdict I’ve worn my weighted vest a few more times since my
  two-week trial. I don’t love how sweaty it makes me. I’m also not sure about
  the best way to clean it as the manufacturer didn’t provide any instructions.
  (I’ve been using cleaning wipes – please don’t tell me if this is wrong.) But
  it is a nice way to add some difficulty and novelty to my Vera walks. Still, I
  don’t think it’s going to become a staple in my routine. I strength train
  several times a week, and a set of heavy squats feels like a more effective,
  challenging and satisfying way of strengthening my legs and bones than walking
  with 16lbs of extra weight. I did enjoy that it made me look like an action
  movie hero though. When I asked my partner how I looked in it, he responded:
  “Tactical.” That’s way cooler than my usual gym look: sweaty 30-something
  woman in a Rainforest Cafe T-shirt.
