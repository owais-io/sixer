  It’s been an unusually busy summer at Manchester City: lotta ins, lotta outs,
  lotta what-have-yous. And Hugo Viana, City’s new director of football, isn’t
  done yet. According to selected rags, City may hijack Chelsea’s move for the
  RB Leipzig and Netherlands forward Xavi Simons. City are also attempting to
  reunite last year’s France Olympic squad by stealth. First they signed Rayan
  Cherki; now they’re being linked with the Monaco midfielder Maghnes Akliouche.
  From the erstwhile champions to the reigning champions. Crystal Palace are
  keen to take Harvey Elliott’s scheming feet off Liverpool’s hands, which may
  also facilitate a move in the opposite direction for Marc Guéhi. Other reports
  suggest Guéhi will see out his contract at Palace and do one for free next
  summer. Brighton want nine figures for Carlos Baleba – £100m, doofus – which
  is a bit too rich even for Manchester United’s taste. Everton want
  Southampton’s Tyler Dibling to join Jack Grealish in a revamped, floppy-haired
  attack. Fulham may break their transfer record to sign the Brazilian winger
  Kevin from Shakhtar Donetsk. And if that doesn’t sound Brazilian enough for
  you, his full name is Kevin Santos Lopes de Macedo do Nascimento Luís Nazário
  de Lima Fred. Roma and Besiktas are desirous of Aston Villa’s Leon Bailey, as
  are Nottingham Forest of Manchester City’s Rico Lewis. Like we said: lotts
  ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous.
