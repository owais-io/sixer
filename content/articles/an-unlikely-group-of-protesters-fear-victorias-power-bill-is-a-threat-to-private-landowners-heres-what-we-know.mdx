  On Wednesday, an unlikely group of protesters gathered on the front steps of
  Victoria’s parliament to oppose a piece of legislation that, at least on the
  surface, appears unremarkable. For this motley collective, which included
  farmers, prospectors, volunteer firefighters and animal advocates concerned
  about the plight of the wedge-tailed eagle, the national electricity
  (Victoria) amendment (VicGrid Stage 2 reform) bill is a major concern. They
  fear the bill will give the government power to access their land without
  their consent to build transmission towers as tall as 85 metres. If they
  resist, they could be fined thousands. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Standing behind a makeshift cage made from farm gates, the rally organiser
  Andrew Weidemann condemned the bill, saying it made farmers and their families
  “feel like we’re behind bars”. He blasted the government’s “stupid push for
  this renewables agenda”. In another cage, a man stood holding a sign that
  read: “I disagreed with Jacinta.” Also in attendance was the Victorian
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, who criticised the government for acting like
  a “dictatorship” with “draconian measures” that “take away your rights”. When
  Battin said the Coalition would oppose the bill and repeal it if elected next
  year, the crowd cheered. So is this bill as alarming as some believe and what
  does it mean for Victorian property owners? Here’s what we know. What is the
  bill? Introduced to parliament last month, the bill hands responsibility for
  planning the state’s transmission network from the Australian Energy Market
  Operator (Aemo) to the government agency VicGrid. It also gives VicGrid the
  responsibility for developing renewable energy zones. The bill creates two new
  funding streams to support communities affected by the construction of energy
  infrastructure and legislates financial incentives for landholders, who will
  receive $8,000 per kilometre of infrastructure on their land annually. But it
  also provides VicGrid and their contractors power to access private land
  without consent when required to construct energy infrastructure. The bill
  states authorised officers can “use reasonable force to gain entry” to private
  land “if it is reasonably necessary to do so”. It also prohibits landowners
  “obstructing, hindering, or delaying the entry of the authorised officer”.
  What are the penalties? Individuals who resist face fines of up to $12,000,
  while body corporates could be slapped with fines of up to $48,000. Refusing
  to provide your name or proof of ownership could result in fines up to $4,000,
  while interfering with a notice of entry could attract a fine of $1,221. What
  rights do property owners have and who can access their land? Only authorised
  officers can access land and the bill sets strict rules for them. They must
  give written notice of entry to the landowner or occupier at least 30 business
  days before entry and again 48 hours before. If the officer can’t find the
  owner of the land, the notice can be published in a newspaper and posted near
  the property entrance. Only if an officer has been blocked or disrupted from
  accessing a property are they able to use force, and only after applying to
  the magistrates court for an entry order. The court order allows the officer
  and other approved people to enter, use reasonable force if needed, bring
  equipment and be accompanied by police. If at this point you attempt to block
  their access, the larger fines apply. A government spokesperson said these
  powers are intended to be used as a last resort – only when all avenues to
  reach agreement for voluntary access have failed. What does the government
  say? The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has defended the bill. She said the
  government and private companies already have the power to forcibly access and
  acquire land. “Whether it’s for transport projects, for energy projects, for
  other projects, there are already arrangements in place for access to land.
  What this is providing is landowners – through VicGrid – a place where they
  can work through the these issues,” Allan said. She conceded some private
  companies’ dealings with landowners had been “not up to scratch” but said the
  new legislation would improve coordination. Allan said more high-voltage
  transmission lines were needed to connect homes and businesses to “reliable,
  cheaper and more secure renewable energy” as it comes online and ahead of the
  closure of “ageing coal-fired plants”. Battin responded: “We’re not
  anti-renewable energy but you can’t do it by bulldozing through people’s
  properties.” Is it unprecedented in Australia? Yes and no. All levels of
  government – local, state and federal – have the power to compulsorily acquire
  private property in certain circumstances. In New South Wales, the government
  similarly set up its own body, EnergyCo, to lead the development of renewable
  energy zones and the transmission infrastructure needed to support them.
  EnergyCo holds compulsory acquisition powers but they are only exercised after
  at least six months of attempted negotiations for voluntary acquisition. The
  Victorian government says NSW, South Australia and Tasmania have fines for
  landowners for denying entry to authorised officers. Who will be affected? In
  late 2024, VicGrid released a draft plan that identified seven renewable
  energy zones in the state that could host renewable projects, including wind
  turbines, solar farms and battery storage. Several travel through agricultural
  areas, angering farmers, who have also been subject to an increased emergency
  services levy in recent weeks by the Allan government (though it has been
  paused this year due to drought). That levy has also been criticised by
  volunteer firefighters, who joined Wednesday’s rally, as well as animal
  activists who say windfarms pose a deadly risk to endangered wedge-tailed
  eagles. The VicGrid plan will be finalised later this year and will also
  include proposed transmission line routes. It includes projects already
  committed to or expected by Aemo, such as the Victoria to NSW Interconnector
  West and the Western Renewables Link, a 190km transmission line from Bulgana
  in western Victoria to Sydenham in Melbourne’s north-west. Both projects have
  faced substantial delays, in part due to community opposition. But the
  government appears determined for them to press ahead. The bill is expected to
  pass the lower house on Thursday and then move to the upper house next sitting
  week.
