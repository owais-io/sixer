  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 7th (NB: this is not necessarily Louise
  Taylor’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 5th Prospects A Champions League campaign beckons and there is the
  Carabao Cup to defend but the removal of Alexander Isak’s image from the
  windows of Newcastle’s club store at St James’ Park is emblematic of a
  troubled Tyneside summer. As if the Sweden striker’s decision to skip the
  club’s tour of Singapore and South Korea while trying to force a move to
  Liverpool was not bad enough, a succession of transfer targets have turned
  Newcastle down. Hugo Ekitiké, Bryan Mbeumo, João Pedro, James Trafford and
  Benjamin Sesko opted to move to Liverpool, London or Manchester as the
  majority Saudi Arabian-owned club operated without a sporting director and
  chief executive. The good news is that Eddie Howe is an excellent coach and
  possesses plenty of high-calibre players, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães,
  Joelinton and Anthony Gordon foremost among them. Throw in the arrivals of
  Anthony Elanga, Aaron Ramsdale and Malick Thiaw and last season’s starting XI
  has been fortified in goal, central defence and on the right wing. The need
  for a couple of strikers and, above all, a resolution to Isak’s flirtation
  with Liverpool remains pressing. Howe’s admission that he “wants players that
  really want to play for this football club” suggests the manager has had
  enough of Isak but much depends on the expected impending financial haggling
  between Newcastle’s owners and the Anfield board. Meanwhile Newcastle have
  failed to win a pre-season fixture. “It’s been a challenging summer,” Howe
  reflected. “But any season can go one of two ways. Things are never as good or
  as bad as you think. At the moment I’m very neutral. I believe that from tough
  moments you can build something even more special than you had before.” The
  manager Any concerns that Howe could flounder away from his south-coast
  comfort zone have been well and truly banished during the near four years the
  former Bournemouth manager has spent on Tyneside. The workaholic 47-year-old
  is an outstanding coach who, in the course of leading Newcastle into the
  Champions League for the second time in three seasons and choreographing the
  Carabao Cup triumph, has improved a series of players beyond measure.
  Joelinton’s startling metamorphosis from struggling centre-forward to
  gamechanging midfielder is testament to Howe’s talents. Although an excellent,
  highly articulate communicator, Newcastle’s piano-playing manager does not
  dispense trust easily and, publicly at least, is a master of circumspection.
  Off-field picture Despite the gargantuan wealth of Saudi Arabia’s Public
  Investment Fund, Newcastle’s relatively skinny commercial revenue streams
  dictate their spending is restricted by Premier League profitability and
  sustainability rules. Fans, and some players, are frustrated by the Saudis’
  failure to deliver a new training ground, and a decision as to whether to
  revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium keeps being postponed. It does
  not help that the club have spent the past 11 months seeking a new chief
  executive after the outgoing Darren Eales’s blood cancer diagnosis and have
  been without a sporting director this summer in the wake of Paul Mitchell’s
  abrupt exit in June, after less than a year in the job. Since the ousting of
  the former minority owner Amanda Staveley and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi,
  last summer the lack of an Arabist and/or an executive conversant with Saudi
  business culture in Newcastle’s UK hierarchy has created an apparent
  disconnect. Star signing The £55m signing of Elanga from Nottingham Forest
  ends Howe’s long-running quest for a new right winger. “I want to showcase my
  talent,” says the rapid-dribbling 23-year-old Sweden international. “I’m pacey
  and direct. I can play on either side, I can play as a striker. I can use both
  feet. I’ve got lots of weapons. I know the gaffer and staff here can take my
  game to another level. What we want to achieve, how we want to play, it’s
  perfect. What we’re building here is unique and special. As soon as I knew
  about Newcastle’s interest it was a no brainer.” Howe has long been impressed
  by a player whose solitary work on his left foot during lockdown has left
  Elanga two-footed. “I’ve got a saying where I’m precise, not rushed,” says the
  former Manchester United winger. “It’s a French saying, precis pas précipité,
  something I go by a lot. In my life, I’ve never rushed anything.” Stepping up
  Lewis Miley is 19 but looks very much the complete midfielder and holds two
  England Under-21 caps. After breaking into Newcastle’s first team during the
  2023-24 campaign, a 6ft 2in player with an eye for goal, equally at home in a
  defensive or attacking midfield role, was restricted to 14 appearances last
  season. If a back injury was partly responsible, the best youngster to emerge
  from Newcastle’s academy for a very long time faced stiff completion from
  Tonali, Guimarães and Joelinton for a starting spot in Howe’s midfield
  trinity. The demands of a Champions League campaign should create more
  opportunities this term when Miley can show he is capable of providing real
  competition for Guimarães and co. A big season for … At 27 Aaron Ramsdale has
  suffered three relegations from the Premier League (with Bournemouth,
  Sheffield United and Southampton), been bought by Arsenal for £30m and won
  five England caps. He joins on loan from Southampton and will compete with
  Nick Pope for a starting place. Howe, Ramsdale’s old Bournemouth manager,
  admires his footwork and regards his former protege as the sort of goalkeeper
  needed to advance Newcastle’s stylistic evolution. But is Ramsdale really a
  better all-round keeper than Pope? Can he recapture the form that once made
  him Arsenal’s first choice? And can he assuage Newcastle’s disappointment at
  seeing Manchester City hijack their move for Trafford, the gifted former
  Burnley goalkeeper?
