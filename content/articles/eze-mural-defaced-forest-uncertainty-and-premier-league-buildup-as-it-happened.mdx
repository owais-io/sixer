  That’s all from us on this Matchday live. Head over to join Billy Munday for
  updates on Manchester City v Tottenham. John Brewin will then be on hand to
  guide you through all the 3pm BST kick-offs a bit later on. Kick-off at the
  Etihad Stadium is just a few minutes away so be sure to join Billy Munday for
  minute-by-minute coverage. With Eberechi Eze expected to be announced as an
  Arsenal player at some point this weekend (it would make sense if they did it
  today, but who knows) Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank insisted yesterday
  that he only wants to work with players who are 100 per cent committed to the
  club. Thanks John. Right, let’s continue this countdown to kick-off. To take
  us through to the kick-offs, Emillia Hawkins will be in the chair. The
  Eberechi Eze mural painted this week in the tunnel near the Emirates has been
  defaced. Before… After… At the Etihad Stadium, the Oasis is pumping, Pep
  Guardiola has entered the building, natty in a black ensemble, and the
  manager’s programme notes again cite “vibes” and how these were “very good”
  during the failed Club World Cup campaign (he used the V-word in yesterday’s
  presser, too). Here, then, is a thought for the imminent Manchester
  City-Tottenham showdown - while Guardiola fields in the XI the firepower of
  Erling Haaland, Rayan Cherki, Omar Marmoush, Tijjani Reijnders, and Osar Bobb
  and Thomas Frank has to rally the troops after losing out on Eberechi Eze and
  Morgan Gibbs White, and is without Dejan Kulusevski due to injury, this humble
  correspondent can see two results. Either City blow Spurs away. Or Frank finds
  a way to pull off a result here as he did when piloting Brentford. Ivan Toney
  scored twice in the November 2022 2-1 victory here. After City’s 4-0 opening
  day win at Wolves the latter may seem silly but as a sage once ventured -
  football can be a quaint old game. Beyond that central defence and Erling
  Haaland, this really is a very new Manchester City team. Thomas Frank is using
  many of the players Big Ange had to hand, though Palinha, who has a big job on
  today, is an updgrade. Manchester City: Trafford, Lewis, Stones, Dias, Ait
  Nouri, Reijnders, Gonzalez, Bobb, Cherki, Marmoush, Haaland. Subs: Ederson,
  Ake, Doku, Rodri, Silva, Matheus Luiz, O’Reilly, Khusanov, Foden. Tottenham
  Hotspur: Vicario, Porro, Romero, van de Ven, Spence, Sarr, Joao Palhinha,
  Bentancur, Kudus, Richarlison, Johnson. Subs: Kinsky, Danso, Tel, Gray,
  Bergvall, Vuskovic, Solanke, Odobert, Davies. Referee: Peter Bankes
  (Merseyside) An optimistic Spurs fan joins us. The Championship’s 12.30
  kick-offs feature some teams with, well issues. Hull v Blackburn Swansea v
  Watford Charlton v Leicester Hull have a transfer ban, the Pozzo family at
  Watford – pioneers of multi-club ownership – want to sell up, while
  Leicester’s finances are wobbly with players on Premier League wages. Per PA
  Media’s Jonathan Veal: Nuno Espírito Santo looks set to be in charge of
  Nottingham Forest for Sunday’s Premier League clash at Crystal Palace. Nuno
  poured fuel on speculation his job was under threat on Friday saying “where
  there’s smoke, there’s fire”. The Portuguese, who signed a new contract in
  June after guiding Forest to European football for the first time since 1995,
  admitted that his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis had
  deteriorated, due in part to the arrival of global head of football Edu
  Gaspar. His outspoken performance at the pre-match press conference for the
  Palace game, which came a week after he publicly criticised the club’s summer
  transfer activity, is understood to have stunned officials at the club. But
  Nuno is expected to take Sunday’s game at Selhurst Park unless there is
  another dramatic turnaround in the build-up to the contest. Forest trained on
  Saturday morning and they will travel to London later in the day. A Spurs fans
  are in “didn’t fancy him anyway” mode. Plenty of sense spoken here, mind. It
  is most definitely the rumour. Could there be a manager less suited to
  Forest’s squad than Ange? Transfer talk: West Ham need something to happen.
  They’ve little room for manoeuvre, it seems. Do Manchester need a new goalie?
  Does a fish need a bicycle? The one (of many) that got away for Eddie Howe,
  Hugo Ekitike, who Newcastle will face on Monday in what they’re calling the
  Alexander Isak derby. “There’s no doubt I really like Hugo and have done for a
  number of years. He’s got really good qualities and he showed that in his
  first Premier League game. He had a really good debut against Bournemouth.
  He’s got really good movement, intelligent, good in the air, scores goals,
  scores off both feet. Our job will be to keep him quiet. He is going to be a
  threat this year.” It’s been a tough window for Eddie and Newcastle: “I’ll be
  pleased when it’s here - pleased if we have what we want. Whenever you go
  through a window, there are ups and downs. It feels like there’s been quite a
  few downs in this one, but also quite a few positives as well. “The players
  we’ve signed are very good players who will add a lot to the squad, a lot in
  terms of the ability, athleticism, fresh energy I’ve spoken about previously.
  There are big positives for us. Of course, there’s one big challenging
  situation that’s not resolved. From that side, I can’t wait for the end of the
  window because we can get back to focusing on the football matches.” Arne Slot
  has paid tribute to Federico Chiesa. We’re in “like a new signing” territory
  here. “I see a totally different Federico now than from large parts of last
  season. It is completely normal because he missed out on the whole pre-season
  and then came into a Premier League rhythm in terms of the amount of games and
  in terms of intensity. “If he is more available then he has more chances to
  impact our results or his playing time. But then it is about him staying as
  fit as he is at the moment. He is in a much better place now and as we can all
  see when we needed a goal and I looked at the bench I only had him and Rio
  (Ngumoha), a 16-year-old, as attacking options.” The fans’ song about him has
  been a hot debate this week on the socials. More on that Coventry stadium
  story, such good news for the club. Owner Doug King: “Today is a defining day
  for Coventry City Football Club. For too long the question of stadium
  ownership has cast uncertainty over our future. By bringing the Arena under
  the Club’s ownership, we are safeguarding not only the present but for future
  generations. This is our home, and it now belongs to the football club and its
  supporters. “This is more than a transaction. It is a statement of ambition
  and belief in Coventry. The Arena will always be a symbol of our city’s
  strength and creativity, and as owners we can invest in facilities, fan
  experience, and wider opportunities for our community. We are proud to finally
  call this stadium our own.” Now to put up a statue of Mark Robins to accompany
  that of Jimmy Hill. As Arsenal ready for the evening’s meeting with Leeds
  Leeds Leeds, the name on everyone’s lips – even if he is unlikely to play – is
  Eberechi Eze, who they won the signature of in an East North London tug of
  love. Richard Lapworth gets in touch: “Looking forward to Sunderland’s first
  away game of the season at Turf Moor. I think we should take all three points
  given we’re a much more feisty team now with more experienced players. Ha’way
  the Lads.” After West Ham’s showing last night, has Sunderland’s confidence
  lessened a tad? Good morning, and here we go for the second round of the
  Premier League. And the third round of the EFL. Fourth for some of them, in
  fact, That’s your lot from me. John Brewin is here to keep you informed and
  intrigued ahead of the today’s action. He may also be making an appearance at
  Football Weekly Live with Max and Barry at the Troxy in London on 11 September
  at 7.30pm (BST), so be sure to cop some tickets for that – whether you attend
  in-person or online. Serie A also opens its doors for business this weekend.
  The reigning champions are Napoli, who begin their season away at Fabio
  Grosso’s promoted Sassuolo later today. Kevin De Bruyne could make his
  competitive debut for Antonio Conte’s side, who will now be without the
  injured Romelu Lukaku for a while. At least Scott McTominay is still around.
  Here’s Nicky Bandini’s scene-setting preview: While Chelsea were busy putting
  balls in West Ham’s net last night, Bayern Munich were very much doing the
  same to poor RB Leipzig. Harry Kane scored a hat-trick in the Bundesliga’s
  curtain-raiser at the Allianz Arena, while Luis Díaz also got on the
  scoresheet on his debut. Other challengers to Bayern’s crown get their
  campaigns under way later today, with Bayer Leverkusen at home to Hoffenheim
  and Borussia Dortmund in Hamburg to play St Pauli. The Coventry City owner,
  Doug King, has completed the purchase of the Coventry Building Society Arena
  from Frasers Group, the club has announced. This is the first time Coventry
  have owned the stadium since it was opened 20 years ago this week. Coventry
  played their first match at what was formerly the Ricoh Arena against QPR on
  20 August 2005. In a nice act of symmetry, QPR are today’s visitors to the CBS
  Arena in the Championship. Coventry said: “This milestone secures long-term
  stability, safeguards the future, and opens new opportunities for growth on
  and off the pitch.” The club have previously spent time playing their home
  matches at Northampton’s Sixfields and Birmingham’s St Andrew’s owing to past
  financial difficulties. Let’s return to the situation at Nottingham Forest:
  That clash on the pitch between Nuno and Marinakis at the end of last season
  was quite the spectacle – and perhaps the manager felt his authority was
  undermined, especially given it was in the view of the public. As for becoming
  the next Watford, that may not seem entirely enticing at the minute, with the
  club firmly wedged in the Championship’s midtable. You might get an FA Cup
  final hammering by Manchester City out of it, though. Bournemouth and Wolves
  both started the season by shipping four goals each, albeit to Liverpool and
  Manchester City. Andoni Iraola could hand debuts to Ben Gannon-Doak and Amine
  Adli, signed from Liverpool and Bayer Leverkusen this week for around £50m
  altogether. Vítor Pereira could field his new right-wing-back, AKA the fastest
  man in Serie A last season, Jackson Tchatchoua. Bournemouth predicted lineup
  (4-1-4-1): Petrovic; Smith, Diakité, Senesi, Truffer; Adams; Semenyo, Scott,
  Tavernier, Brooks; Evanilson Wolves predicted lineup (3-4-3): Sá; Doherty,
  Agbadou, T Gomes; Hoever, André, J Gomes, Møller Wolfe; Munetsi, Strand
  Larsen, Bellegarde Brentford are another side hoping to bounce back from an
  opening-weekend defeat. Keith Andrews will come up against Unai Emery today as
  Aston Villa visit the Gtech Community Stadium. Dango Ouattara, Brentford’s
  record signing, could make his debut today following his £42.5m move from
  Bournemouth this week. Villa, meanwhile, could hand a first start to their
  £30.5m new forward, Evann Guessand. After being sent off against Newcastle,
  Ezri Konsa is suspended on his return to his former club. Brentford predicted
  lineup (4-2-3-1): Kelleher; Kayode, Collins, Van den Berg, Henry; Yarmolyuk,
  Jensen; Carvalho, Schade, Lewis-Potter; Thiago Aston Villa predicted lineup
  (4-2-3-1): Martínez; Cash, Kamara, Mings, Digne; Tielemans, Onana; McGinn,
  Rogers, Guessand; Watkins It is only the second weekend of the season and
  Burnley v Sunderland already feels critical in the battle for who stays up.
  They are separated by a three-point and six-goal gap after the opening weekend
  saw the Clarets lose 3-0 to Spurs and the Black Cats win by the same scoreline
  against West Ham. Home form will be imperative for Burnley if they are to have
  any chance of staying in the league and they cannot afford to lose against
  fellow promoted sides. The defensive setup has changed from the one that
  served Scott Parker so well last season and Richarlison made the most of it. A
  Kyle Walker home debut should be enough to get Burnley rocking, showing the
  sort of player they can attract but if without a win, the worries will start
  to creep in before August is over. Sunderland will be confident after a busy
  summer and downing of West Ham. If they double their points tally at Turf
  Moor, it would see them 15% of the way to the magical mark of 40. Momentum is
  an asset in football and building it at this stage is essential, especially
  with another very winnable home game against Brentford next week that could
  help define Sunderland’s season. Perhaps the tastiest offering of the Premier
  League’s 3pm menu comes at Turf Moor. Burnley, on the wrong end of a 3-0
  scoreline last weekend, and Sunderland, on the right end of one, do battle. Is
  it too early to call this a relegation six-pointer? It could not have gone
  much better for Régis Le Bris and Sunderland against West Ham. Captained by
  Granit Xhaka, they looked a confident group in what was their first Premier
  League game since 2017. Sunderland fan Richard Lapworth is feeling positive:
  “I think we should take all three points today given we’re a much more feisty
  team now with more experienced players.” Speaking of farcical situations, Nuno
  Espírito Santo is at risk of winning the sack race at Nottingham Forest. He
  revealed yesterday that his relationship with the owner, Evangelos Marinakis,
  had broken down: It’s not good. I think everybody at the club should be
  together but it’s not the reality. The reality is that [it] is not what it
  used to be. It was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on
  trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good. Ange Postecoglou is
  thought to be in the frame to replace Nuno, whose team face Crystal Palace
  tomorrow. On paper it looks like a good match – the passionate support, the
  Europa League, the Greek connection. But when you consider that Postecoglou is
  very much a trust-the-process man, mate, and that Marinakis is, well, the
  opposite, it’s hard to see them getting along. Then there’s the Europa League.
  Of course, Ange won it with Spurs last season but at what cost to their league
  campaign? It’s not his second season yet, either. As for Tottenham, it’s
  looking fine and dandy on the pitch. The Super Cup performance against PSG was
  promising (mostly) and the dispatching of Burnley on the opening day was
  smooth enough for Thomas Frank’s first league match in charge. But off the
  pitch, well … Spurs continue to be the butt of jokes. Their pursuit of
  Eberechi Eze seemed nothing short of a farce. Without James Maddison for an
  extended period and having missed out on Morgan Gibbs-White as well, you fear
  they may be lacking in the creative department. Being able to form a low block
  against City today may suit them, as it did against PSG, with Frank likely to
  return to a 3-5-2 formation. Predicted lineup (3-5-2): Vicario; Danso, Romero,
  Van de Ven; Porro, Sarr, Palhinha, Bentancur, Spence; Kudus, Richarlison
  Today’s Premier League fixtures kick off at 12.30pm (BST) with Manchester City
  v Tottenham. Pep Guardiola has been playing it down but there must be a sense
  in the Manchester City camp of wanting to right some wrongs after last
  season’s humiliating 4-0 home loss to a Spurs side that went on to finish
  17th. “It’s just another opportunity – revenge makes no sense,” Pep said this
  week. Rúben Dias has signed a new contract through to 2029, Erling Haaland is
  up and running on the goals front and new signings like the two Rayans –
  Aït-Nouri and Cherki – are bedding in well. It’s all looking rosy for Pep, you
  have to say. Predicted City lineup (4-2-3-1): Trafford; Lewis, Stones, Dias,
  Ait-Nouri; González, Reijnders; Silva, Cherki, Bobb; Haaland As for Chelsea,
  well, things are looking up. But it didn’t look like that for a while.
  Palmer’s withdrawal from the starting XI was later explained by Maresca as
  precautionary, with the England international not feeling 100% over the last
  few days and feeling something in his groin. Then Robert Sánchez didn’t
  exactly cover himself in glory for Paquetá’s opener. As good a strike as it
  was, the Chelsea fans would have had a good grumble behind the goal after
  seeing Sánchez waft his glove in its general direction. Estêvão, in for the
  injured Palmer, was chastised afterwards by Maresca for giving the ball away
  in the buildup to the goal: “We conceded because of him”. It got better,
  though. The Brazilian teenager was at the heart of Chelsea’s attacking threat.
  After João Pedro and Pedro Neto had put them in front, the 18-year-old set up
  Enzo Fernández’s third with a piercing run through the West Ham defence which,
  admittedly, was not the sturdiest. After Mads Hermansen did some flapping of
  his own at two second-half corners, the game was up. Chelsea fans – is this
  the start of a title charge? Let’s start with last night, shall we? Chelsea
  will be waking up this morning feeling a lot better about themselves than
  after their opening bore-draw against Crystal Palace. Despite losing Cole
  Palmer in the warm-up and going behind to Lucas Paquetá’s early stunner, Enzo
  Maresca’s world champions looked very much that, with five goals in reply. The
  headlines, though, have been reserved for Graham Potter, whose comeback job at
  West Ham is not exactly going to plan. The ease with which Chelsea found the
  net, particularly at set pieces, will no doubt trouble the former Blues
  manager. The mass exodus that greeted every Chelsea goal and the boos at
  full-time of this 5-1 defeat were proof of the (exponentially) growing
  discontent among West Ham supporters. Just two games into the season and there
  is talk of a manager’s job under threat and possible relegation. West Ham fans
  – where has it all gone wrong already? Hello and welcome to Matchday live,
  where we will be looking back on last night’s drubbing of West Ham by Chelsea
  at the London Stadium and building up to Saturday’s games in the Premier
  League and beyond. Here are today’s top-flight fixtures in full: 12.30pm
  Manchester City v Tottenham 3pm Bournemouth v Wolves, Brentford v Aston Villa,
  Burnley v Sunderland 5.30pm Arsenal v Leeds There is also a full EFL
  programme, Scottish Premiership fixtures and the start of Serie A and the
  Bundesliga. We would like you to get in touch via our dedicated email
  matchday.live@guardian.co.uk to share your plans, predictions and thoughts for
  today’s games. And we’d like to hear from West Ham and Chelsea fans on what
  you made of events last night – good and bad.

Home form will be imperative for Burnley if they are to have any chance of staying in the league and they cannot afford to lose against fellow promoted sides. The defensive setup has changed from the one that served Scott Parker so well last season and Richarlison made the most of it. A Kyle Walker home debut should be enough to get Burnley rocking, showing the sort of player they can attract but if without a win, the worries will start to creep in before August is over. Sunderland will be confident after a busy summer and downing of West Ham. If they double their points tally at Turf Moor, it would see them 15% of the way to the magical mark of 40. Momentum is an asset in football and building it at this stage is essential, especially with another very winnable home game against Brentford next week that could help define Sunderland’s season. Perhaps the tastiest offering of the Premier League’s 3pm menu comes at Turf Moor. Burnley, on the wrong end of a 3-0 scoreline last weekend, and Sunderland, on the right end of one, do battle. Is it too early to call this a relegation six-pointer? It could not have gone much better for Régis Le Bris and Sunderland against West Ham. Captained by Granit Xhaka, they looked a confident group in what was their first Premier League game since 2017. Sunderland fan Richard Lapworth is feeling positive: “I think we should take all three points today given we’re a much more feisty team now with more experienced players.” Speaking of farcical situations, Nuno Espírito Santo is at risk of winning the sack race at Nottingham Forest. He revealed yesterday that his relationship with the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, had broken down: It’s not good. I think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality. The reality is that [it] is not what it used to be. It was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good. Ange Postecoglou is thought to be in the frame to replace Nuno, whose team face Crystal Palace tomorrow. On paper it looks like a good match – the passionate support, the Europa League, the Greek connection. But when you consider that Postecoglou is very much a trust-the-process man, mate, and that Marinakis is, well, the opposite, it’s hard to see them getting along. Then there’s the Europa League. Of course, Ange won it with Spurs last season but at what cost to their league campaign? It’s not his second season yet, either. As for Tottenham, it’s looking fine and dandy on the pitch. The Super Cup performance against PSG was promising (mostly) and the dispatching of Burnley on the opening day was smooth enough for Thomas Frank’s first league match in charge. But off the pitch, well … Spurs continue to be the butt of jokes. Their pursuit of Eberechi Eze seemed nothing short of a farce. Without James Maddison for an extended period and having missed out on Morgan Gibbs-White as well, you fear they may be lacking in the creative department. Being able to form a low block against City today may suit them, as it did against PSG, with Frank likely to return to a 3-5-2 formation. Predicted lineup (3-5-2): Vicario; Danso, Romero, Van de Ven; Porro, Sarr, Palhinha, Bentancur, Spence; Kudus, Richarlison Today’s Premier League fixtures kick off at 12.30pm (BST) with Manchester City v Tottenham. Pep Guardiola has been playing it down but there must be a sense in the Manchester City camp of wanting to right some wrongs after last season’s humiliating 4-0 home loss to a Spurs side that went on to finish 17th. “It’s just another opportunity – revenge makes no sense,” Pep said this week. Rúben Dias has signed a new contract through to 2029, Erling Haaland is up and running on the goals front and new signings like the two Rayans – Aït-Nouri and Cherki – are bedding in well. It’s all looking rosy for Pep, you have to say. Predicted City lineup (4-2-3-1): Trafford; Lewis, Stones, Dias, Ait-Nouri; González, Reijnders; Silva, Cherki, Bobb; Haaland As for Chelsea, well, things are looking up. But it didn’t look like that for a while. Palmer’s withdrawal from the starting XI was later explained by Maresca as precautionary, with the England international not feeling 100% over the last few days and feeling something in his groin. Then Robert Sánchez didn’t exactly cover himself in glory for Paquetá’s opener. As good a strike as it was, the Chelsea fans would have had a good grumble behind the goal after seeing Sánchez waft his glove in its general direction. Estêvão, in for the injured Palmer, was chastised afterwards by Maresca for giving the ball away in the buildup to the goal: “We conceded because of him”. It got better, though. The Brazilian teenager was at the heart of Chelsea’s attacking threat. After João Pedro and Pedro Neto had put them in front, the 18-year-old set up Enzo Fernández’s third with a piercing run through the West Ham defence which, admittedly, was not the sturdiest. After Mads Hermansen did some flapping of his own at two second-half corners, the game was up. Chelsea fans – is this the start of a title charge? Let’s start with last night, shall we? Chelsea will be waking up this morning feeling a lot better about themselves than after their opening bore-draw against Crystal Palace. Despite losing Cole Palmer in the warm-up and going behind to Lucas Paquetá’s early stunner, Enzo Maresca’s world champions looked very much that, with five goals in reply. The headlines, though, have been reserved for Graham Potter, whose comeback job at West Ham is not exactly going to plan. The ease with which Chelsea found the net, particularly at set pieces, will no doubt trouble the former Blues manager. The mass exodus that greeted every Chelsea goal and the boos at full-time of this 5-1 defeat were proof of the (exponentially) growing discontent among West Ham supporters. Just two games into the season and there is talk of a manager’s job under threat and possible relegation. West Ham fans – where has it all gone wrong already?
