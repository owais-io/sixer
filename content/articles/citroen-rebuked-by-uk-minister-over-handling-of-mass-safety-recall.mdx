  The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has expressed “serious concerns”
  about Citroën’s handling of a safety recall that has left thousands of Britons
  unable to drive their cars. In June the car company’s owner, Stellantis,
  issued an immediate and rare “stop drive” order for certain models because of
  a potentially fatal airbag safety fault. The alert was for C3 and DS3 models
  manufactured between certain dates, which meant 120,000 vehicles in the UK
  were affected. In the letter to Eurig Druce, UK group managing director of
  Stellantis, Alexander said the “level of disruption experienced by UK
  motorists – particularly the most vulnerable – is unacceptable”. Alexander
  urged the company to take “immediate steps” to improve the recall process.
  This meant ensuring all affected owners are “provided with viable
  alternatives”, whether through courtesy cars, financial compensation or
  at-home repairs. In the letter, first reported by the PA news agency, the
  minister said the existing arrangements were “not meeting expectations”. She
  had received reports from MPs and their constituents that detailed distressing
  experiences and inadequate support with alternative transport arrangements.
  The consumer group Which? recently described Stellantis’s handling of the
  recall as “chaotic”. It said it had heard from “many distressed drivers” –
  including a woman caring for her terminally ill husband who needed to get to
  hospital appointments – who were incurring significant expenses for hire cars,
  taxis or insurance fees. While Stellantis had promised to minimise the burden
  on consumers, the “execution of this recall has exposed significant gaps in
  customer support and transparency”, Alexander said. Cars equipped with Takata
  airbags are being recalled because chemicals in the inflators may deteriorate
  over time, which could cause the bag to rupture. No incidents have been
  reported in the UK, but Stellantis issued the “stop drive” order across Europe
  after a woman in France was killed when her airbag exploded. Driving one of
  the cars can invalidate your insurance, and it is illegal for a private seller
  to sell a car with a “stop drive” recall without disclosing it first.
  Stellantis insisted that Citroën was “fully engaged” in maximising the daily
  number of cars that can have their airbags replaced, adding that its Peugeot
  network is now authorised to also carry out the work. To date more than 72,000
  vehicles have had replacement airbags fitted and Stellantis expects the
  majority of vehicles to be repaired by the end of September, with any
  remaining cases handled within weeks. Stellantis explained that with such a
  large number of vehicles affected it was “inevitable” that customers could be
  inconvenienced in the short term. “For each and every customer, we discuss
  options to support mobility. These options include replacement airbags at a
  dealership or at home, a courtesy car, support for other mobility options and
  recovery. We give priority to those with the most urgent needs.”
