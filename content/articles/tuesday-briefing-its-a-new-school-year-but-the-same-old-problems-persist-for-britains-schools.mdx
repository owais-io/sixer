  Good morning. It’s back-to-school week, and the daily ritual (or, perhaps,
  panic) begins as uniforms are being donned and lunchboxes packed across the UK
  to start a new year. My sympathies to you teachers setting early morning
  alarms, and parents dragging children out of bed after six weeks of lie-ins.
  Last year, Keir Starmer promised to leave “no stone unturned to give every
  child the very best start at life”, but how is that going? More than half a
  million GCSE students in England will start the year with no physics teacher,
  while many kids from poorer families feel they cannot afford to have their
  children study geography or languages, new Guardian reporting shows. These are
  just a few things that reveal bigger issues about the lack of opportunities
  for millions of bleary-eyed children getting up for school this week. For
  today’s newsletter, I spoke to Guardian education correspondent Sally Weale
  about how inequality is embedded into the system, and whether Labour is doing
  enough to tackle it. First, the headlines. Five big stories Afghanistan | The
  Taliban has called for international aid as Afghanistan reels from an
  earthquake that killed more than 800 people and left thousands injured.
  Israel-Gaza war | A plan circulating in the White House to develop the “Gaza
  Riviera” as a string of high-tech megacities has been dismissed as an “insane”
  attempt to provide cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the
  Palestinian territory’s population. Politics | Darren Jones, the chief
  secretary to the Treasury, has been moved to a new senior role in Downing
  Street as Keir Starmer attempts to get a grip on delivery before what is
  likely to be a tumultuous autumn for the government. Health | A three-minute
  brainwave test can detect memory problems linked to Alzheimer’s disease long
  before people are typically diagnosed, raising hopes that the approach could
  help identify those most likely to benefit from new drugs for the condition.
  UK news | Prominent women including cultural figures, politicians and
  campaigners have signed a letter criticising rightwing attempts to link sexual
  violence in Britain to asylum seekers. Signatories include the musicians
  Paloma Faith, Charlotte Church and Anoushka Shankar. In depth: ‘Some
  four-year-olds are already on the back foot by the time they start school’ A
  significant challenge for some schools starts not in the classroom but with
  recruitment. One-quarter of English state schools have no specialist physics
  teachers, with maths, biology or chemistry teachers typically being roped in
  to do the job, according to research by the Institute of Physics. Many of
  these teachers have not studied physics beyond the age of 18, and may
  themselves have only studied the subject to GCSE level. “Recruitment of new
  teachers, and then retention of teachers you’ve already got, has been very
  difficult for quite a long time,” said Sally Weale. Take physics: people with
  science degrees are likely to have a lot of better-paid employment
  opportunities in the private sector. “Certain school subjects have been
  particularly badly affected, and physics is a big one. Most head teachers I
  talked to said the physics teacher is a big issue for them. Very often they
  haven’t got one.” Pay for teachers is typically poor, and it’s a tough job
  with long hours, and generally no opportunities for working from home. “You
  are in front of 30 students, you have to be at the top of your game all the
  time,” said Sally. Students in schools without specialist physics teachers are
  half as likely to go on to study A-level physics. More than 300 schools in
  England have none taking it, the report found. Unsurprisingly it is typically
  kids in the poorer areas who are worst affected. Not only does this negatively
  impact opportunities for individual students, it also make it difficult to
  recruit scientists and innovators in key sectors such as quantum, photonics,
  nuclear and semiconductors, the report found. *** ‘Baked-in inequality’
  Secondary school pupils from low-income families are “bounced out” of studying
  subjects like geography and languages because of concerns about the cost of
  field trips and excursions abroad, according to a survey of children in
  England. Fears about extra costs prevent almost a quarter of children on free
  school meals from choosing certain GCSE subjects. “The reality is that some
  subjects just are no-go areas for lower-income families,” said Sally. “I
  remember when there would be school trips and parents would just say, ‘Sorry,
  we can’t afford it.’ I think it’s always been part of what’s going on in
  schools, but these differences have become much more acute.” Other subjects
  with additional costs are music, which can require lessons and instruments;
  food and nutrition, due to the cost of ingredients; and PE, because of extra
  kit and equipment. Nine per cent of pupils who did not receive free-school
  meals said the cost – or concerns about the cost – prevented them from
  studying these subjects, according to Survation for the Child Poverty Action
  Group (CPAG). “Kids from the poorest backgrounds are always at such a huge
  disadvantage. It’s not just what subjects they can study and it’s not just
  physics teachers,” said Sally. “They could be living in areas where it’s hard
  to attract good teachers, or they don’t have access to the same enrichment, or
  their families have less capacity to support them. This is something that I’m
  writing about all the time, and have been ever since I started this job over
  10 years ago. It’s a kind of baked-in inequality that is very hard to deal
  with, and it’s basically about poverty.” *** What is the attainment gap? This
  year, A-level results in England reached a record high outside the pandemic
  era, However, the stark regional divide between London and the rest of the UK,
  particularly the north-east and East Midlands, has widened. This is down to a
  range of factors, including investment in London schools during the Blair
  government, the higher pay and attractiveness of working in London for
  teachers, and gentrification of the city. The attainment gap between poorer
  students and their wealthier peers had been closing from about 2010 onwards,
  but that progress began to stall in 2018, probably because of funding
  pressures on schools, said Sally. Since Covid, the gap has grown and though
  there have been small signs of improvement recently, the gap remains far
  bigger than before the pandemic. “Covid blew it all out of the water. The
  government would say there’s some evidence the attainment gap is closing
  slightly, but it’s still absolutely huge,” Sally said. “Disadvantaged
  four-year-olds are already on the back foot by the time they start school.”
  *** What is Labour doing? Since Labour has come in it has expanded free school
  meals, including introducing free breakfast clubs into all primary schools in
  England. From this week, working parents who earn up to £100,000 a year will
  be entitled to 30 hours’ free childcare a week during term time for children
  from the age of nine months until they start school. “Critics would say it
  barely scratches the surface,” said Sally. Labour’s flagship child poverty
  strategy will not be published until autumn. The decision to push back the
  strategy comes amid concerns about the cost implications of ending the
  two-child limit on universal credit. Experts say scrapping the benefit limit
  would be the single most effective way of reducing child poverty – an
  estimated 100 children are pulled into poverty every day by the limit, meaning
  up to 20,000 could be affected by a six-month delay. “Everybody is waiting to
  see the sort of child poverty strategy. I think that will be key to how their
  success is regarded,” said Sally. “At the heart of that is the two child
  benefit cap. The general feeling is that it needs to go, and it’s responsible
  for keeping too many families in poverty. Poverty is an enemy of opportunity.”
  What else we’ve been reading Is Donald Trump a dictator? Adam Gabbatt surveys
  the US president’s inflammatory actions – from deploying the national guard to
  his compulsive use of executive orders. He speaks with political scientists
  about where Trump currently sits on the spectrum of between democracy,
  authoritarianism and outright dictatorship. (From more by Adam, sign up to his
  Week in Trumpland newsletter here.) Craille Maguire Gillies, newsletters team
  More and more people are blocking out the news because it fills them with
  dread. This piece examines the emotional toll of “doomscrolling”, and gives
  tips on how to stay engaged and not fall into a pit of negativity – if you can
  face reading it. Phoebe Dr Velislava Hillman is persuasive about how AI in
  education is a lot less revolutionary than big tech companies might make it
  seem. “What is sold as the ‘democratisation’ of education may be entrenching
  further inequality,” she writes, as the elite opt for human tutoring and the
  less-privileged are offered mass, app-based instruction. Craille Some great
  news from conservationists who have found Mexico’s jaguar population has
  increased 30%. The main thing they’ve done is protect natural areas to keep
  these beautiful cats away from cattle ranchers. “Mexico and the world need

  United States in Rome two years ago after captain Luke Donald unsurprisingly
  opted for experience with his wildcard picks. Tennis | The All England Club is
  not looking to change the format of the Wimbledon mixed doubles competition
  for future editions of the Championships despite the success of the
  “reimagined” tournament at the US Open. The front pages “PM tries to regain
  policy control from Treasury in No 10 shake-up” says the Guardian and the
  Telegraph depicts Rachel Reeves as “Smiling through the pain” after being
  “frozen out by Starmer”. The i paper’s version is “Starmer seizes grip of
  budget after Treasury ‘mistakes’ hit Labour in polls” and the Financial Times
  has “Starmer acts to arrest slide with shake-up in Downing St”. The Express
  runs with “Farage’s ‘I’ll get rid of you’ threat to PM”. The Daily Mail fumes
  “‘One in, one out’ fiasco: 3,567 in, zero out”. “Refugees to be stopped
  bringing in families” – that’s the Times. “I’d be safer in Somalia” – the
  Metro says its interviewee wants to be sent back. “Ban the vapes” is the top
  story in the Mirror which says experts are warning of irreversible harm to
  young brains and hearts. Today in Focus North Korean defector on why Kim
  Jong-un has sent troops to Ukraine When Hyun-Seung Lee was 17 he was
  conscripted into the North Korean army. Meals were basic and conditions were
  poor. Reports emerged in October last year of North Korean soldiers fighting
  for Russia in Ukraine. Hyun-Seung Lee, now living as a defector in the US,
  believes they will be gaining invaluable experience. Cartoon of the day | Ben
  Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all
  bad Tina Woods started clubbing in her mid-50s, after having an “epiphany
  moment” on a dancefloor. “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection
  – was like a lightning bolt,” she says in this week’s edition of A new start
  after 60. After a few years of clubbing came another epiphany: wanted to be a
  DJ. Dancing and DJing has also helped her connect to herself. “I’m finding
  myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually.
