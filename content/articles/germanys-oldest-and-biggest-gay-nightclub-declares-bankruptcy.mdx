  Germany’s “oldest and biggest” gay dance club has declared itself bankrupt
  after nearly half a century in business, falling victim to inflation and an
  evolving party culture threatening Berlin’s nightlife. Management troubles and
  dating apps were among the factors putting SchwuZ on the ropes last year and
  in May the club shortened its opening hours, laid off staff and asked regulars
  for help to plug a growing shortfall, to little avail. On Thursday, the
  management team posted on Instagram: “SchwuZ has filed for insolvency. But: we
  don’t want to give up!” The post noted SchwuZ’s integral role in Berlin’s
  LGBTQ+ scene since it was founded in Kreuzberg in 1977, helping two years
  later to launch the Christopher Street Day parade and the queer magazine
  Siegessäule. “For nearly 50 years, SchwuZ has been more than just a club. It’s
  a second living room. A place for queer art, community, family, resistance,”
  it said. “Many of us have found what we were looking for here: a home, our
  chosen family, and freedom.” SchwuZ, which is short for SchwulenZentrum or gay
  centre, moved to a much larger space with capacity for 1,000 revellers in
  fashionable Neukölln in 2013, which may have been the beginning of the end.
  This year the club has had a deficit each month of €30,000-€60,000
  (£26,000-£52,000), with income on a downward slide, the public broadcaster RBB
  reported. SchwuZ’s managing director, Katja Jäger, said an ailing economy, an
  ageing core clientele and the creeping crisis in the Berlin club scene had all
  taken their toll. Surging rents and electricity prices have threatened to put
  many beloved Berlin hotspots out of business after a shortlived post-Covid
  revival, in a gloomy phenomenon known as Clubsterben (the death of clubs). In
  May, SchwuZ had to let go of 33 employees – about a third of its staff, many
  of them long-serving – and cut back on professional drag shows. A crowdfunding
  campaign collected only €3,000 of a €150,000 goal. The club has now staged a
  last-ditch bid for supporters to rally behind it “for future queer generations
  who need a place that uplifts, empowers and makes them visible”. The social
  media post drew an outpouring of solidarity, with the drag star and political
  activist Gloria Viagra vowing: “We can do it together …!!!!” Other
  commentators, however, complained about an outdated music playlist and steep
  prices at the door. SchwuZ hopes to stay open until October when the
  insolvency hearings will begin, RBB reported. The dying nightclub scene in
  Berlin has become increasingly pronounced in the last year. Busche Club, a
  historic gay and lesbian dance spot, closed last weekend after four decades,
  blaming rising operation costs. Busche was founded in 1988 in communist East
  Berlin and developed an image as the “anti-Berghain” – a party hotspot
  catering for an international crowd. On New Year’s Eve, Watergate, an upmarket
  riverside institution and part of the electronic music scene, closed after 22
  years, citing a range of challenges including inflation, a growing preference
  for outdoor music events, high DJ wages and a drop in budget flights to
  Berlin. The techno club Wilde Renate, which offers open-air and indoor
  dancing, has announced plans to shut at the end of the year after a protracted
  struggle with a property magnate over its lease. The planned extension of the
  A100 motorway poses a further threat to several popular clubs around Ostkreuz
  railway station, prompting protests for Berlin’s centre-right government to
  abandon construction. Emiko Gejic, a spokesperson for the Club Commission
  lobby group, said: “Clubs are an important part of the city’s DNA … but also
  an economic factor.”
