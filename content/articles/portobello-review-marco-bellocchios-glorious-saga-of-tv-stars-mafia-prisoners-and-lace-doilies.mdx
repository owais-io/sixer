  prisoners and lace doilies

  Marco Bellocchio, the tireless warhorse of Italian cinema, kicks up a swirling
  dust cloud of corruption with this fabulous, stranger-than-fiction account of
  an 80s TV star convicted of conspiring with the Camorra. Shot for the
  streaming service HBO Max, it is the director’s second historical miniseries
  after 2022’s Exterior Night, about the kidnapping of Aldo Moro, and features
  the same lead player in Fabrizio Gifuni, an actor who has surely cornered the
  market in playing glossy public figures whose lives are about to take a
  hellish turn. Bellocchio’s dramas typically inhabit this kind of shonky, venal
  moral universe. The ground is liable to drop away pretty much at any moment.
  Gifuni stars as Enzo Tortora, a primetime TV presenter in the twinkling Terry
  Wogan mould who hosts a Friday night entertainment show on a soundstage made
  up to resemble an old-style small-town market. Portobello features dances and
  phone-ins and stars a parrot called Ramon, who point-blank refuses to speak.
  The show pulls in a peak audience of about 28 million, which means it’s
  watched by everyone, in all social classes, from the sisters at the convent to
  the cons inside Naples’ Poggioreale prison. One of these prisoners is such a
  fan of Portobello, in fact, that he posts Tortora a set of knitted lace
  doilies to be auctioned at his market. Naturally the inmate wants a namecheck
  on the show – or failing that, a letter of thanks. So he writes to Tortora
  again, and this time he’s more peeved. Bellocchio turns 86 in November and has
  spent the bulk of his career exploring the darker, smoke-filled rooms of
  Italian history, whether it was tackling 70s Red Brigade terrorism (Good
  Morning, Night), 80s mafia culture (The Traitor) or a 19th-century papal
  conspiracy (2023’s Kidnapped). But every good period drama is at least
  tangentially about the present, and so it is with Portobello, which
  anticipates the rise of first Berlusconi and then Trump, with its corrosive
  cocktail of celebrity, politics and organised crime. The first two episodes
  (of a total of six) premiered at the Venice film festival, and neatly crosscut
  Tortora’s bright, primetime rise with the pathetic, scrambling slide of
  Giovanni Pandico (Lino Musella), a servile mob secretary who is so in fear of
  his life that he will essentially tell the DA’s office whatever it wants to
  hear. Tortora, Pandico says, is a Camorra insider, while “lace doily” is code
  for a shipment of cocaine. And the parrot, Ramon? Well, he was in on it, too.
  “This is the theatre of the absurd,” protests Tortora when he’s hauled in for
  questioning, and one can sympathise with his plight. He has been poleaxed by a
  chain of events that appear to have begun with a humble set of doilies and may
  end with a 10-year stretch inside. A different breed of director might have
  mined the material for laughs and cast Tortora in the role of a hysterical
  clown. Bellocchio, though, elects to play the story entirely straight – as a
  hard-faced procedural in which Pandico’s desperate throwaway lie takes on a
  remorseless momentum. So Bellocchio’s Portobello is finally nothing like its
  namesake at all. It’s potent and serious, mordantly funny and bitingly
  cynical. Dragged on to the street in handcuffs, Tortora looks up and sees he’s
  being filmed by the cameramen from his own TV station. The man is still a
  primetime star of sorts, but he’s now made the jump from light entertainment
  to the nightly news. • The first two episodes of Portobello screened at the
  Venice film festival.
