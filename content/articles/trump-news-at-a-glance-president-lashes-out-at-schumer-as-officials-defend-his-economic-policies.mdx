  It has not been a brilliant weekend for Donald Trump. On Sunday administration
  officials fanned out on US political shows to defend the president’s policies
  after a bruising week of poor economic, trade and employment numbers that
  culminated with the firing of labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer. US
  trade representative Jamieson Greer said Trump has “real concerns” about the
  jobs numbers that extend beyond Friday’s report that showed the national
  economy added 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. Job growth numbers
  were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well. On CBS
  News’s Face the Nation, Greer defended Trump’s decision to fire McEntarfer, a
  respected statistician, saying: “You want to be able to have somewhat reliable
  numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go
  in really extreme ways.” It comes as the president himself lashed out at
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on social media, telling him: “GO TO
  HELL!” after a Senate standoff over confirmations. ‘The president is the
  president’ US trade representative Jamieson Greer has defended the firing of
  labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer. “The president is the president. He
  can choose who works in the executive branch,” he said on Face the Nation.
  Greer was among a host of Trump administration officials who were deployed to
  defend Trump after a week of bruising economic numbers. William Beach, who
  served as Trump’s commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in his
  first presidency, warned that McEntarfer’s dismissal would undermine
  confidence in the quality of US economic data. Read the full story President
  tells Chuck Schumer to ‘GO TO HELL’ The US Senate left Washington DC on
  Saturday night for its month-long August recess without a deal to advance
  dozens of Donald Trump’s nominees, calling it quits after days of contentious
  bipartisan negotiations and the president taking to social media to tell
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to “GO TO HELL!” Without a deal in
  hand, Republicans say they may try to change Senate rules when they return in
  September to speed up the pace of confirmations. Trump has been pressuring
  senators to move quickly as Democrats blocked more nominees than usual this
  year, denying any fast unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each
  one, a lengthy process that can take several days per nominee. Read the full
  story Trump administration denies daily quota for immigration arrests In a new
  court filing, attorneys for the Trump administration denied the existence of a
  daily quota for immigration arrests, despite reports and prior statements from
  White House officials about pursuing a goal of at least 3,000 deportations or
  deportation arrests per day. Lawyers representing the US justice department
  said that the Department of Homeland Security had confirmed that “neither Ice
  leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical
  quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any
  other operational activities that Ice or its components undertake in the
  course of enforcing federal immigration law.” Read the full story Senate
  confirms Trump ally Jeanine Pirro as top federal prosecutor for DC The US
  Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro – a former Fox News host and staunch Donald
  Trump ally who boosted lies that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of
  electoral fraudsters – as the top federal prosecutor for the nation’s capital.
  Pirro – a former New York state district attorney and county judge who joined
  Fox News in 2011 – was confirmed on Saturday in a 50-45 vote along party
  lines. In a statement issued by Pirro after the vote, the Republican said she
  was “blessed” to have been confirmed as the US attorney for Washington DC.
  “Get ready for a real crime fighter,” said Pirro’s statement, which called the
  US attorney’s office she had been confirmed to lead the largest in the
  country. Read the full story What else happened today: The Smithsonian says it
  will restore Trump impeachment exhibits in “coming weeks”. Bizarre public
  appearances again cast doubt on Trump’s mental acuity. Legal cases could prise
  open Epstein cache despite Trump’s blocking effort. Texas Democrats are
  fleeing the state to prevent a vote on Monday that could see five new
  Republican-leaning seats created in the House of Representatives. Catching up?
  Here’s what happened on 2 August.
