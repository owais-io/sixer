  climate catastrophe

  The villagers of Pralognan-la-Vanoise in the French Alps know well the perils
  posed by the mountains that encircle them. Avalanches, rockfalls, mudslides,
  sudden crevices and torrents of water are within the living memory of most
  villagers, and every day the climate emergency throws up new dangers. Less
  than a year ago, an enormous lake formed by a melting glacier was discovered
  high above Pralognan that experts feared could inundate the village with more
  than 60,000 cubic metres of icy water. Bernard Vion, a 66-year-old Alpine
  guide who has watched the expanse of water grow and the mountain change over
  his lifetime, said the region was on the frontline of the climate crisis but
  laughed when asked if he was worried. “I live just underneath the rocks and I
  sleep easy in my bed now as I did before,” he said. “People who live in the
  mountains have a resilience to natural dangers.” As used to natural hazards as
  local people are high up in the Alps, they are not, however, an idle threat.
  The Swiss village of Blatten was wiped out by a rock and ice avalanche in May
  and last year a mountain lake swollen by heavy rainfall caused torrential
  flooding in La Bérarde in the Isère, forcing inhabitants to flee the hamlet.
  They have not returned. Today, an engineering operation is under way to
  prevent such a catastrophic scenario in Pralognan. Three workers have been
  helicoptered to the Grand Marchet glacier at an altitude of 2,900 metres to
  gouge a narrow, 6-metre deep, 100-metre long “overflow channel” in the ice.
  This will channel water from the lake into the cascades that feed streams of
  crystalline blue water flowing through Pralognan. “The aim is to help the
  water find its way down the mountain gradually and avoid a rapid emptying of
  the lake,” said David Binet, the director of the mountain land restoration
  service (RTM) for the northern Alps, part of the national forestry commission
  tasked with identifying and preventing natural hazards. “What causes the
  problems and damage with torrents in the mountains is not the water but the
  stones, gravel, sand and even large rocks it brings down with it.” The glacier
  blocks the lake from spilling down the mountain but it is shrinking at a rate
  of 2 to 3 metres a year. There is also the risk that that the warmer waters of
  the lake could form a channel gush from underneath. Binet said his agency was
  examining 300 of the estimated 600 lakes in the Alps and Pyrenees one by one
  for such hazards. The Pralognan operation will cost about €400,000 (£350,000)
  and should be finished by the end of summer. The idea of taking mechanical
  shovels to glaciers already shrinking at an alarming rate was deemed the least
  environmentally damaging option. Olivier Gagliardini, a glacier expert at
  Grenoble University, described it as “unfortunate, but necessary”. Martine
  Blanc, the mayor of Pralognan, said the decision to carry out the work was
  taken by her and the Savoie prefecture, the local state authority, after
  scientists examined the glacier and defined the risk. “We asked ourselves
  could it wait but on the principle that prevention is better than cure we
  decided to go ahead,” she said. “We decided to anticipate events rather than
  suffer them. Nature is nature and there’s no such thing as zero risk.” Most
  controversial was closing the municipal camping site, next to a cascade that
  runs into the village, in case the work provoked a surge of water, she said.
  “It was a matter of public safety, which is my absolute priority,” she added.
  Local shopkeepers say the number of tourists and hikers this summer is down,
  possibly because the campsite is closed, but Silvere Bonnet, the director of
  the tourist office, said he had had very few calls from potential visitors
  concerned about the lake. “Nobody is particularly worried. The prevention work
  is being carried out so hopefully the problem will be solved,” said the local
  cable car operator as the Guardian plunged into the vertiginous void over the
  village. Arriving in Pralognan – the gateway to the Vanoise national park – on
  a sunny day, the giant rock faces etched with shimmering cascades that rise
  almost vertically have a benevolent beauty. An hour later in a rapid change of
  atmosphere, the peaks are cloaked in dark clouds and loom intimidatingly.
  “They can appear rather menacing at first to visitors because they are so
  sheer,” Vion said. The 66-year-old knows these mountains “like his pocket”, as
  the French say. He made his first high-altitude climb aged eight with his
  father, also a guide. Both his grandfathers were Alpinists. Vion first spotted
  what he describes as “a puddle” of water on the Grand Marchet glacier in 2019.
  Every year since he has watched it grow; it now measures almost 2.5 acres.
  “The mountain today is very different to 50 years ago. We rarely ever saw
  lakes like this on the glaciers then or had rockfalls of such intensity and
  frequency,” he said. He taps his phone to find pictures of the latest chunk of
  mountain that has collapsed because the permafrost, the cement that holds the
  rocks together, has melted. “We are on the frontline of climate change here.
  We know it is happening,” he said. Blanc agreed. “We were born in Pralognan
  and it’s clear to us there’s no comparison between what we saw when we were
  kids and today but in recent years things have really speeded up,” she said.
  “Now we can really see the difference. Even the sun in the mountains is no
  longer the same. We can feel it. We also have a lot more of the winds that
  bring sand from the desert, which settles on the glaciers and is also
  accelerating the melting.” She added: “People here are used to natural
  hazards. We’re used to avalanches, falling rocks, torrential floods and
  mudslides because we’ve seen them and lived with them since we were young.
  Local people understand there are things we can control and then those we
  cannot.” • This article was amended on 11 August 2025. An earlier version
  referred incorrectly to 13,000 gallons of water when it should have said
  60,000 cubic metres. This has been corrected.
