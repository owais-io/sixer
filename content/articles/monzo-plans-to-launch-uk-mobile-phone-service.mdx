  Monzo is looking to launch its own mobile phone service in the UK, in a move
  that could heighten competition among big phone groups and secure further
  revenue for the growing digital bank. The online-only lender, which was
  launched in 2015, is in the early stages of developing a digital sim card: a
  software version of the insertable chip used to connect a phone to cellular
  networks and the internet. That could open the door to lucrative mobile phone
  contracts with new and existing customers, putting pressure on incumbents such
  as VodafoneThree and the BT-owned operator EE. Big phone providers are already
  facing competition from financial firms including Revolut and the
  buy-now-pay-later provide Klarna, which are also trying to take a slice of the
  mobile phone market. A spokesperson for Monzo said: “Monzo is known for
  transforming products – and an entire industry – to deliver a great experience
  for customers. So when we heard from our customers that mobile contracts can
  be a pain point we set out to explore how we could do this the Monzo way, and
  are in the early stages of developing this idea.” The move, which was first
  reported by the Financial Times, would help diversify revenues for Monzo,
  which has already gone from a scrappy newcomer luring millennials with its
  sleek app and hot coral pink card, to a fully licensed bank with more than 13
  million UK customers and more than 3,900 staff. It could help increase the
  company’s valuation before an anticipated initial public offering. Monzo was
  last valued at £4.5bn in October 2024 when employees sold stock to existing
  investors. This followed a funding round in May the same year that raised
  £500m. While its valuation has lagged significantly behind its rival Revolut,
  which was last valued at $45bn (£33.6bn), Monzo has focused most of its growth
  in the UK and gained a coveted banking licence from British regulators in
  2016. Revolut has only been granted a restricted licence and, 12 months on,
  has yet to have its application fully authorised despite government efforts to
  hasten the process. Monzo was recently embroiled in controversy and fined £21m
  over weak financial crime controls. An investigation by the Financial Conduct
  Authority found that the controls were lax enough that customers were able to
  register for accounts using “obviously implausible UK addresses when applying
  for an account”, including 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and Monzo’s
  own headquarters. The bank’s chief executive, TS Anil, said last month that
  the FCA fine drew a line under issues he said had been resolved and were
  “firmly in the past – with our learnings at the time leading to substantial
  improvements in our controls”.
