  There was plenty that Dina Asher-Smith chose not to say after running a
  scintillating championship record to retain her British 200m title on Sunday,
  but there was enough that she did say. Most tellingly, she spoke with a big
  smile. It was, she revealed, immediately after a disappointing run at the
  Eugene Diamond League four weeks ago that she decided a major change was
  required and there was no time to wait. Mid-season upheavals are rare in
  athletics, and Asher-Smith had only moved to Texas to work with the coach
  Edrick Floréal at the back end of 2023. But something – and, for now, she does
  not want to reveal precisely what – was not working. So, with barely more than
  one month until the Tokyo world championships, the former world 200m champion
  packed her bags and flew home to London. Asher-Smith has run twice since:
  first finishing a fine second to the Olympic silver medallist Julien Alfred
  over 200m at the London Diamond League a fortnight ago, and then clocking
  22.14sec to triumph in Birmingham on Sunday. That was a time good enough time
  to make the Olympic podium last summer; one she has bettered only once since
  2022. Whatever has changed since returning to London – and the details are
  deliberately lacking, for now – it is clearly paying off. “I am back in London
  and so grateful to have an incredible support system,” she said, determined to
  avoid specifics. “Everybody is different, and different set-ups in different
  locations mean different things for everybody. I just think, for me, and the
  personality type I am, I need to be happy, free and my fullest, most vibrant
  self. I need to be in an environment where I can have discussions and work
  hard through my races week on week. I think it’s really important to be in an
  environment that recognises that and fosters it. “I’m more than happy to talk
  about it after Tokyo but I just want to stay focused because I am in great
  shape and know I can go there and perform really well. I’ve been really happy
  with these last two races because I’ve been able to be me and run really
  fast.” The clock showed as much on a blustery Sunday afternoon at the
  Alexander Stadium. Aided by a perfect 1.9m/s tailwind, Asher-Smith claimed the
  British title by a whisker from Amy Hunt, who had been crowned 100m champion a
  day earlier in Asher-Smith’s absence. The finish was so close that Hunt was
  awarded the same time, but had to make do with silver. They will resume battle
  in Tokyo in September, alongside Daryll Neita, who finished third. There was
  also an incredibly quick championship record of 19.90sec from Zharnel Hughes,
  who added the 200m crown to the 100m he had claimed on Saturday, when
  dedicating the win to his aunt whose funeral he missed to compete this
  weekend. Elsewhere, Georgia Hunter Bell gave herself the headache of whether
  to run just one or both of the 800m and 1500m in Tokyo after easing to the
  British title over the shorter distance in 1min 59.53sec. The Olympic 1500m
  bronze medalist must decide before the British team announcement at the end of
  this month. “I am probably in better shape over 800m on the world stage,” she
  said. “But the 1500m is first, so I could really tire myself out by doing
  three rounds of hard 1500m and coming fifth or sixth after running a crazy
  fast time. “It is head over heart. How cool would it be to follow in the
  footsteps of the great British athletes like Seb Coe, Kelly Holmes, Steve
  Cram, who did double up, and were successful? It is hard to decide.” Hunter
  Bell’s 800m triumph came in the absence of the Olympic champion and her
  training partner Keely Hodgkinson, who has not raced this year but is due to
  return from injury this month. Asked whether she can beat Hodgkinson, Hunter
  Bell said: “I don’t know. We train together all the time. She’s such a good
  athlete and it will be the first time we’ve raced where we’re kind of close.
  Whenever I have raced her before she’s been so far ahead. It will be
  interesting. I still think she’s a league ahead, so we’ll see.” There were
  British titles for a number of world medal hopefuls, including the reigning
  world 1500m champion Josh Kerr, who cruised to 5,000m gold. Amber Anning and
  Charlie Dobson picked up 400m crowns, while Max Burgin front ran his way to
  800m victory. Morgan Lake won the high jump, with Jazmin Sawyers continuing
  her comeback from an achilles rupture to take long jump gold.
