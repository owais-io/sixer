  A backlash is brewing against Meta over what it permits its AI chatbots to
  say. An internal Meta policy document, seen by Reuters, showed the social
  media giant’s guidelines for its chatbots allowed the AI to “engage a child in
  conversations that are romantic or sensual”, generate false medical
  information, and assist users in arguing that Black people are “dumber than
  white people”. Singer Neil Young quit the social media platform on Friday, his
  record company said in a statement, the latest in a string of the singer’s
  online-oriented protests. “At Neil Young’s request, we are no longer using
  Facebook for any Neil Young related activities,” Reprise Records announced.
  “Meta’s use of chatbots with children is unconscionable. Mr. Young does not
  want a further connection with Facebook.” The report also has generated a
  response from US lawmakers. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri,
  launched an investigation into the company Friday, writing in a letter to Mark
  Zuckerberg that he would investigate “whether Meta’s generative-AI products
  enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and
  whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards”. Republican
  senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said she supports an investigation into
  the company. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, called the policies
  “deeply disturbing and wrong”, adding that section 230, a law that shields
  internet companies from liability for the content posted to their platforms,
  should not protect companies’ generative AI chatbots. “Meta and Zuckerberg
  should be held fully responsible for any harm these bots cause,” he said. On
  Thursday, Reuters published an article about internal Meta policy documents
  that detailed ways in which chatbots are allowed to generate content. Meta
  confirmed the document’s authenticity but said that it had removed portions
  which stated it is permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic
  roleplay with children after receiving a list of questions. According to
  Meta’s 200-page internal policy seen by Reuters, titled “GenAI: Content Risk
  Standards”, the controversial rules for chatbots were approved by Meta’s
  legal, public policy and engineering staff, including its chief ethicist. The
  document defines what Meta staff and contractors should treat as acceptable
  chatbot behaviors when building and training the company’s generative AI
  products but says that the standards do not necessarily reflect “ideal or even
  preferable” generative AI outputs. The policy document said it would be
  acceptable for a bot to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that “every inch of
  you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply” but it also limits what
  Reuters described as “sexy talk”. The document states, for example, that “it
  is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate
  they are sexually desirable”, including phrases like “soft rounded curves
  invite my touch”. The document also addressed limitations on Meta AI prompts
  on hate speech, AI generation of sexualized images of public figures, often
  sexualized, violence, and other contentious and potentially actionable content
  generation. The standards also state that Meta AI has leeway to create false
  content so long as there’s an explicit acknowledgment that the material is
  untrue. “The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and
  inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed,” a statement from Meta
  reads. Although chatbots are prohibited from having such conversations with
  minors, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said, he acknowledged that the company’s
  enforcement was inconsistent. Meta is planning to spend around $65bn on AI
  infrastructure this year part of a broader strategy to become a leader in
  artificial intelligence.The head-long rush into AI comes by tech giants come
  with complex questions over limitations and standards over how, with what
  information, and with whom, AI chatbots are allowed to engage with users.
  Reuters also reported on Friday that a cognitively impaired New Jersey man
  grew infatuated with “Big sis Billie”, a Facebook Messenger chatbot with a
  young woman’s persona. Thongbue “Bue” Wongbandue, 76, reportedly packed up his
  belongings to visit “a friend” in New York in March. The so-called friend
  turned out to be a generative artificial intelligence chatbot that had
  repeatedly reassured the man she was real and had invited him to her
  apartment, even providing an address. But Wongbandue fell near a parking lot
  on his way to New York, injuring his head and neck. After three days on life
  support, he was pronounced dead on 28 March. Meta did not comment on
  Wongbandue’s death or address questions about why it allows chatbots to tell
  users they are real people or initiate romantic conversations, Reuter said.
  The company did, however, say that Big sis Billie “is not Kendall Jenner and
  does not purport to be Kendall Jenner”, referencing a partnership with the
  reality TV star.
