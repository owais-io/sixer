  Budapest Festival Orchestra / Fischer review – palpable joy in a vivid Prom
  pairing of Beethoven and Bluebeard

  Beethoven’s jubilant Seventh Symphony and a psychodrama about serial polygamy
  may seem curious bedfellows, but when the band is as good as the Budapest
  Festival Orchestra, who cares? This was the 19th Proms appearance of the
  ensemble founded by Iván Fischer and the late Zoltán Kocsis in 1983, and like
  the finest of Hungarian reds they have matured splendidly. Chief among many
  virtues was the visible sense of camaraderie, that and the palpable joy they
  brought to the music-making, no matter how familiar the fare. These musicians
  must have played No 7 countless times, yet still it came up fresh as a daisy.
  There was the opulent string tone, bows digging deep as if the performers’
  lives depended on it. Brass and woodwind players seemed born soloists, yet
  each visibly embraced the team spirit. And then there was Fischer, a model of
  elegance, coaxing and cajoling while teasing out those tiny details that lent
  the music spontaneity and vitality. In a truly memorable performance, the
  seamless flow and Fischer’s dynamic control of the Allegretto stood out, every
  instrumental line crystal clear (no mean feat given the Albert Hall’s soupy
  acoustic). Ditto the frisky scherzo, light and airy as a good souffle. The
  Bartók opera Duke Bluebeard’s Castle was an opportunity for the orchestra to
  demonstrate its impressionistic side, invoking a broad range of moods and
  musical imagery. Fischer paid close attention to orchestral colours, conjuring
  if not 50, then at least 12 shades of grey to convey the dank and gloom of
  Bluebeard’s sunless domain along with grinding dissonances and tense, eerie
  pianissimos. Woodwind and xylophone painted a lurid portrait of his grisly
  torture chamber, flickering brass fanfares illuminated the corners of a
  vicious armoury, while harp and celesta brought a hypnotic sparkle to the
  blood-stained treasury. The radiant flower garden and the overwhelming C major
  vistas behind the fifth door were vividly expressed. Dorottya Láng, a glowing,
  gutsy Judith, and Krisztián Cser, the most implacable of Bluebeards brought a
  crucial native intensity to the Hungarian text. Fischer’s expert hand on the
  tiller ensured the drama ground inescapably onwards to its chilling
  denouement. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue
  until 13 September
