  ‘We are seeing a new maturity’: how ‘extended reality’ is coming of age at the
  Venice film festival

  The future came early to this year’s Venice film festival as the event’s
  pioneering Venice Immersive (VI) section launched a day before the official
  opening gala. Based on the small island of Lazzaretto Vecchio, a short boat
  ride from the main festival site, VI points to a possible new direction for
  cinema with an eclectic programme of extended reality (XR) artworks. The mix
  of installations, videos and virtual worlds can look outlandish when compared
  with the other, more traditional pictures at the festival. But VI’s base at
  Venice reveals the event’s true parentage and core principles. “Our mission,
  in holding this event at one of the biggest film festivals, has always been to
  build bridges between the cinema industry and the budding immersive
  community,” says Michel Reilhac, who established VI alongside co-curator Liz
  Rosenthal back in 2017. “This year, I feel that mission is being manifested.”
  As evidence, Reilhac points to the fact that two veteran mainstream directors
  – The Bourne Identity’s Doug Liman and Conclave’s Edward Berger – have made
  the jump to XR projects selected for this year’s competition. By the same
  token, the immersive community have learned from conventional cinematic
  storytelling and are increasingly incorporating these lessons into their work.
  “In the early years a lot of people were mainly experimenting with the tools,”
  Rosenthal says. “Now we are seeing a new maturity and a seamless evolution in
  terms of narrative storytelling.” This year’s VI selection showcases 69
  projects from 27 countries, whittled down from an initial submission of about
  450. These range in length from Menghui Huang’s seven-minute VR animation The
  Big Cube, through to Olov Redmalm and Klaus Lyngeled’s interactive fantasy The
  Midnight Walk, which has a running time of six hours. Potential highlights
  include Craig Quintero and Phoebe Greenberg’s Blur, a theatrical exploration
  of AI cloning, Wayne McGregor’s mixed reality dance production On the Other
  Earth, and Singing Chen’s The Clouds are Two Thousand Meters Up, a VR epic
  adapted from a short story from Taiwanese author Wu Ming-Yi. “The Clouds are
  Two Thousand Meters Up is spectacular,” Rosenthal says. “That’s the closest
  I’ve seen to an immersive piece that’s stepping into cinema, but on its own
  terms.” VI’s various subgenres – immersive film, mixed reality, installations
  – provide handy signposts for newcomers to navigate this unfamiliar terrain.
  But they may also be a series of category errors that run counter to the
  spirit of immersive art. “VR borrows from the language and elements of
  cinema,” Reilhac says. “So it’s both an evolution of cinema and its own
  artform. I don’t know if it’s relevant to label and pigeonhole them any more.
  What we are seeing this year is a complete hybridisation.” According to
  Rosenthal, the clue is in the name. “Immersive art involves the melding and
  blending of all the forms, whether it’s live performance or virtual, games
  design or cinema,” she says. “It’s not a matter of choosing one form or the
  other.”
