  Final arguments have concluded in the national security trial of the
  pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. Government-picked judges
  are retiring to consider their verdict in the case, seen internationally as a
  crucial test of the rule of law in the city. Lai, 77, has been in prison since
  2020, when he was charged with two counts of conspiracy to collude with
  foreign forces and one count of conspiracy to publish seditious material. The
  charges were brought under a sweeping national security law (NSL) imposed by
  Beijing after anti-government protests in 2019, and a colonial-era sedition
  law. Often referred to as the Rupert Murdoch of Asia, Lai was one of the few
  Hong Kong business leaders willing to criticise Beijing, which has labelled
  him a “modern-day traitor” and “riot supporter”. The case is the most
  high-profile example of the Hong Kong government’s crackdown on the
  pro-democracy opposition in the city under the NSL, which broadly outlawed any
  act of dissent. According to his lawyers and family, Lai has various health
  issues, including a heart problem. He could face life in prison if convicted.
  Asked about the timing of a verdict, one of the three judges overseeing the
  case said it would be announced “in good time”. Lai’s trial, similar to other
  national security cases, is being presided over by designated judges instead
  of a jury, a departure from the city’s common law system. Closing arguments by
  the prosecution and the defence began last week, after delays caused by bad
  weather and then concerns over Lai’s health. They concluded on Thursday
  morning. Lai, dressed in a beige linen blazer and white shirt, smiled, nodded
  and waved at the public gallery before being escorted away by corrections
  officers. He also raised his thumb a few times. Prosecutors accused Lai of
  using his media outlet, Apple Daily, and foreign political connections to
  lobby for governments to impose sanctions and other punitive measures on
  Chinese and Hong Kong authorities. They said he showed “unwavering intent”,
  and that the alleged collaborations were “long-term and consistent”, beyond
  the introduction of the NSL. His alleged collaborators included the activist
  Andy Li and paralegal Chan Tsz-wah, both of whom testified against him at
  trial, and the Interparliamentary Alliance on China. He was also accused of
  financing the advocacy group Stand with Hong Kong. In court, Lai’s defence
  team said prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient evidence for the claims
  of conspiring with Li, Chan, or other alleged co-conspirators to request
  foreign sanctions after the NSL’s introduction. Marc Corlett KC said that the
  prosecution’s submission that Lai stayed in contact with former US defence
  officials “goes in no way to demonstrate” their case because those individuals
  had not been named as “co-conspirators”. The senior counsel Robert Pang had
  earlier defended Apple Daily, saying “it is not wrong to support freedom of
  expression. It is not wrong to support human rights.” Pang told the court the
  media’s role was to facilitate public discourse, and that the newspaper’s
  position was one of a wide variety of views taken by Hong Kong’s many outlets.
  “Apple Daily was not calling for public debate,” he said. “Apple Daily was
  part of the public debate.” Lai was arrested alongside several others
  including executives at his company, during a raid on the Apple Daily newsroom
  and associated locations in August 2020. He was granted bail but then taken
  into custody in December that year and has remained behind bars ever since, on
  remand and then serving sentences for other convictions related to
  pro-democracy protests and fraud charges which his supporters say were trumped
  up. Apple Daily was forced to close in June 2021. Foreign governments, legal
  organisations and rights groups have widely criticised the prosecution of Lai,
  in particular the ultimately successful efforts of the Hong Kong and Beijing
  authorities to block his chosen lawyer, the UK barrister Tim Owen KC, from
  defending him. The authorities have rejected criticism, labelling Lai “a
  voluntary political tool of foreign forces trying to curb China through Hong
  Kong”. The trial stretched to 156 days, far beyond the 80 days initially set
  down. The closely watched hearings were often attended by supporters and
  international observers, including foreign diplomats based in the city, who
  would line up for hours to secure limited seating. Lai took the stand in
  November, the first time he had been heard in public since his not guilty plea
  in January that year. He said he never tried to influence foreign policy or
  ask foreign officials to take concrete action on Hong Kong. Shortly after his
  arrest in 2020, while at home on bail, Lai told the Guardian his case would be
  a “litmus test” of Hong Kong’s legal system since the NSL. He said the
  pro-democracy movement’s ultimate goal of gaining complete democracy for Hong
  Kong was no longer possible, but they had to keep fighting. “We don’t know
  when we’ll win, but we’re so sure we’re on the right side of history, and time
  is on our side,” he said.
