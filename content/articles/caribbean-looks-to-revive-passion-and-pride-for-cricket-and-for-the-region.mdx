  When they toured overseas in the 1970s, West Indies cricketers were sometimes
  subjected to barrages of racist abuse. But back home in the Caribbean, the men
  were heroes, with families huddled around radios and televisions whenever they
  played and shouts of jubilation erupting across entire communities whenever
  they won. Today, the generation of players who won two World Cups, in 1975 and
  1979, are acclaimed as living legends for stepping up to the crease regardless
  of the challenges – and triumphing over teams from larger, more developed
  nations. And as the region celebrates Emancipation Month to commemorate the
  end of slavery, they have been hailed as figures of regional pride whose
  mastery of a game imported by the British became a powerful symbol of
  political and cultural resistance. Earlier this month, St Vincent and the
  Grenadines (SVG) hosted the first-ever Emancipation Cricket Festival, which
  the culture and tourism minister, Carlos James, described as a reminder of the
  powerful link “between our emancipation, resistance, our Caribbean culture and
  the birth of Caribbean cricket”. “Some folks ask, why are you linking cricket
  – which is a game of the English – to emancipation. How does it correlate?
  Well, it was a period where every Caribbean national was glued to their radios
  … their television sets, to follow these men who went out in the middle of the
  cricket pitch,” James said. By touring – and winning – that generation of
  sportsmen sent a powerful message, he said: “They were making a political
  statement that we are young Black men from small Caribbean islands – and we
  can dominate the world.” James said that understanding the link between sport
  and politics – and reviving the collective passion for the game – could help
  turn the tide for today’s West Indies team, which has performed poorly in
  recent games. St Vincent and the Grenadines’ prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves,
  one of the region’s strongest voices for reparations from Europe for the
  genocide of Native peoples and the enslavement of African people, said the aim
  of the emancipation festival was to bring awareness to the region’s period of
  struggle and resistance. “Cricket, a game brought to us … by the British
  colonists, became our own existential instrument to aid our quest for national
  liberation, liberty, equality, fairness and justice,” he said. “We absorbed
  this English sport, mastered it, transcended its limits, made it our own,
  redefined it - and took it beyond the boundaries.” He added that today,
  “cricketing culture” remained vital to the region. But such is the state of
  Caribbean cricket that Caricom, the 15-country regional bloc, recently said
  that it was “deeply concerned … about all aspects of the current state of the
  game in the region”. In a statement, Caricom said: “Cricket has, for decades,
  been a platform through which our small nations have collectively stood tall
  on the world stage. West Indies Cricket is very much a ‘public good’.” It
  added that “the [West Indies] team’s recent performance is a moment of
  reckoning for this cherished Caribbean institution”. Describing cricket as a
  “glue that has kept us together”, Sir Clive Lloyd, who twice led the West
  Indies to world cup victory, welcomed the intervention by Caricom, saying: “We
  are not a very rich area and [it will be good] if they can inject cash and
  whatever it is that is needed.” Kesrick Williams, 35, a former cricketer from
  St Vincent, said some of today’s players were becoming disillusioned and
  needed more support. He called for a change in the general culture of West
  Indies cricket to revive passion for the sport among children and young
  people. “I can’t tell when last I saw cricket being played in the road and the
  traffic had to stop. We have to build back that cricket culture and that firm
  love for the game,” he said. “Growing up, what would put a smile on my dad’s
  face was watching cricket. As a youngster when I saw that … I fell in love
  with cricket.” James said Caricom was hoping to include the cricket heroes of
  the 70s – who were recently the subject of a set of a commemorative stamps in
  SVG – in discussions about the game: “Most of the legends are still around.
  And if we can take an ounce of passion that they have, and we move that from
  their generation to the next generation of Caribbean cricketers, it will make
  a whole heap of difference.”
