  A transgender woman was treated “as a hostile invader” and allegedly directly
  discriminated against twice when she was excluded from a women-only social
  media app, a court has heard. Giggle for Girls and its CEO, Sall Grover, are
  challenging Justice Robert Bromwich’s landmark federal court judgment that
  found Roxanne Tickle was indirectly discriminated against when she was barred
  from the platform in September 2021. The case was the first gender identity
  discrimination case to reach the federal court. On the second day of the
  appeal hearing in Sydney, Tickle’s barrister, Georgina Costello KC, told the
  court her client was directly discriminated against, both when she was barred
  from the app and when the app refused to readmit her. Costello said her client
  was treated “as a hostile invader”, rather than how a cisgender woman would
  have been treated when joining Giggle for Girls. The court heard Tickle, who
  is from regional New South Wales, presented as a woman in an onboarding selfie
  she uploaded to the app, including by wearing a low-cut top and with her hair
  down. Grover checked the photo and barred Tickle from membership to the app.
  Tickle then approached Grover multiple times asking for her membership to be
  reinstated. Grover’s actions in response were again allegedly in breach of the
  Sex Discrimination Act because she saw Tickle as a man, despite Tickle’s
  continued presentation and identity as a woman, Costello claimed. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Costello said Bromwich erred when he did not consider
  evidence including that Tickle presented as a woman in her selfie, that she
  politely inquired as a female about her access to the app not functioning, and
  that Grover treated her as a woman when she said she would “look into” the
  issues. “She thinks she’s dealing with a woman, then she looks at the photo
  and decides she is dealing with a man,” Costello said, adding that Grover had
  a “wilful blindness to gender identity”. Tickle’s team put to the court that
  Grover knew she was dealing with a transgender woman – a claim that Grover has
  always denied. Grover’s denial she knew Tickle was a transgender woman was
  “not a defence to direct discrimination”, Costello said. If it was, a person
  could simply deny knowledge of an attribute protected by the Sex
  Discrimination Act, which would subvert its function, the court heard. In
  response to Costello’s arguments, Grover’s barrister, Noel Hutley SC, said
  Bromwich was correct in finding direct discrimination had not occurred and
  that his client was not aware Tickle was transgender. When dealing with
  Tickle’s potential readmittance to the app, Grover was reacting to a
  photograph only, he said. “My client looked at that and formed the view that
  the respondent was a male,” he told the court, adding that the organisation
  was having to review “thousands” of selfies a day. He said Costello should
  have cross-examined Grover in court about her affidavit containing evidence
  she was aware of Tickle’s full name, had communicated with her as a female and
  only then saw her photo. The court heard Tickle’s core sense of identity and
  self had been undermined by Grover’s actions. Tickle is seeking a total of
  $40,000, which includes $30,000 in general damages, and $10,000 in aggravated
  damages. Her team will argue previously awarded damages of $10,000 are
  inappropriate and did not take into account Grover’s conduct around the
  proceedings. The court’s attention was taken to a candle depicting a crude
  caricature of Tickle, on sale as part of fundraising efforts for Giggle’s
  campaign. In April 2024, the court was not shown the candle as Bromwich found
  it too offensive. Tickle’s team claimed further damages should be awarded
  because of Grover’s continued campaign of misgendering of their client and
  because she laughed at the caricature in a full court room, “exacerbating the
  embarrassment and stress”. Hutley said Grover’s laughter in court – described
  by Bromwich in his judgment as “obviously disingenuous … offensive and
  belittling” – should be excluded on the basis that it was the fault of
  Tickle’s counsel for submitting the candle as evidence. The hearing continues.
