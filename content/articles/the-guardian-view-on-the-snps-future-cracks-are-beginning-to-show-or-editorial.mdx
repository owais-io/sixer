  In July, Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, set out a three-stage plan
  to achieve separation from the United Kingdom. Part one would “build the
  highest levels of support possible” for independence. Part two involved a plan
  to “turn the heat up on Westminster” to concede a new referendum. Part three
  would require an “emphatic win” in next May’s Scottish parliament elections.
  If Mr Swinney’s plan sounded familiar, that’s because it is. Previous
  nationalist first ministers have tried similar strategies in recent times –
  but all without success. Mr Swinney may meet a similar fate, because the
  Scottish National party looks unlikely to be able to deliver. Support for
  independence hovers around the 50% mark, but the UK government will not
  concede a referendum, while the SNP, although leading in the polls in
  Scotland, currently has the support of only about a third of voters. Assuming
  the polls stay the same, Mr Swinney could form a minority government next May,
  but not a coalition with a majority. Attempts to portray such an outcome as an
  independence referendum mandate would thus seem doomed to fail. The reality is
  therefore that independence is likely to remain off the table well beyond
  2026. This will not please a lot of party activists, some of whom will try to
  lower the bar to a second referendum at the October SNP conference. The hard
  truth is that the coming months will be bittersweet for the party. A fifth
  successive Holyrood victory would be a formidable SNP achievement, and a
  humiliation to Labour. Mr Swinney would also be entitled to say he had
  steadied the ship after the tumult of the Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf
  resignations in 2023 and 2024. But the next Holyrood parliament looks set to
  be the most fragmented yet, especially with the arrival of a large Reform UK
  presence. The danger to the SNP, alongside the reward, is thus very real. Mr
  Swinney may struggle to get any divisive legislation through. Every compromise
  he makes will offend some party interest group or other. He is one of the last
  active members of the generation who have governed Scotland continuously since
  Alex Salmond’s 2007 victory. It is increasingly likely that he may face a
  leadership challenge at some point. Such a process is fraught with problems
  for the SNP. The party is a fractious place. In the past few weeks, two of the
  SNP’s most prominent women of the past decade have stepped away. Mhairi Black,
  on the left, quit the Commons last year and has now left the party altogether.
  Kate Forbes, the deputy first minister and a social conservative, has now
  announced she will not stand for Holyrood next May. These are serious losses,
  not just to the party but to Scotland’s civic life. Despite their many obvious
  contrasts, the two are charismatic and talented personalities with high public
  profiles. Their decisions are not flattering about the culture of the SNP, or
  that of Scottish politics more widely. Ms Forbes, in particular, gave her
  party and the Swinney leadership the balance and credibility that was needed
  in the wake of the troubled Sturgeon and Yousaf exits. Mr Swinney has said he
  will serve a full term if re-elected. Yet challengers are already circling,
  and Mr Swinney may not have it his own way. As ever, the SNP talks as if
  tomorrow is its to command. After nearly 20 years of power, however, cracks
  are increasingly hard to disguise.
