  Sunscreen company Ultra Violette says it will immediately withdraw its Lean
  Screen Skinscreen product from the market after new tests found a “pattern of
  inconsistency” in its SPF results. The company’s co-founders, Ava
  Chandler-Matthews and Bec Jefferd, on Friday published the test results in a
  statement in which they apologised to customers, offered them refunds and
  instructed them to stop using the product. Ultra Violette ordered the
  additional testing after the consumer advocacy group Choice in June published
  an investigation into the SPF claims of several popular sunscreen brands,
  including Ultra Violette. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In Choice’s test,
  the Ultra Violette Lean Screen SPF 50-plus Mattifying Zinc Skin Screen, a
  higher-end product that retails for upwards of $50, returned an SPF result of
  just 4 in Choice’s test. A second test returned a result of 5, Choice said.
  Ultra Violette had publicly disputed Choice’s findings. But on Friday
  Chandler-Matthews and Jefferd said the results of their own additional tests
  had demonstrated “significant” and “atypical” variability. In a statement
  posted on Ultra Violette’s website and Instagram, Chandler-Matthews and
  Jefferd said they had commissioned eight different tests from multiple,
  independent laboratories. “Lean Screen has now returned SPF data of 4, 10, 21,
  26, 33, 60, 61, and 64,” they said. “That wasn’t good enough for us, and it
  isn’t good enough for you.” Chandler-Matthews and Jefferd emphasised that
  their announcement “only concerns the performance of Lean Screen”. They said
  tests of Ultra Violette’s other products had “reinforced our confidence in the
  rest of our line”. The Choice chief executive, Ashley de Silva, said it had
  released its sunscreen testing results in June in the interest of the public.
  “Today’s announcement from Ultra Violette confirms there is a clear problem
  with how sunscreen is regulated and tested in Australia,” De Silva said.
  “Without Choice’s investigation, Ultra Violette’s Lean Screen would still be
  on shelves, despite the fact that it does not provide anywhere near the amount
  of sun protection it claims to.” De Silva urged the Therapeutic Goods
  Administration (TGA) to provide an update on the investigation into sunscreen
  testing it began after Choice released its results, saying other brands could
  also be affected. The TGA on Thursday published a statement on its website
  saying its investigation was ongoing. “Given the complexity and scale of the
  material involved, this process will take time,” the regulator said.
  “Variability in sun protection factor testing results … is a known issue,” it
  said. “The TGA is currently reviewing existing SPF testing requirements. In
  doing so, the TGA is exploring alternative test methods that may be more
  reliable, including in vitro test methods.” Contacted for further comment on
  Friday, a spokesperson for the TGA said it would take regulatory action “as
  appropriate” depending on the outcome of its own investigation. “The TGA does
  not generally publicly comment on investigations or compliance action on
  individual matters until they are concluded, as doing so may compromise the
  investigation,” they said.
