  The US economy added 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than expected, amid
  ongoing concerns with Donald Trump’s escalating trade war. Forecasters
  surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted the July jobs report would show a drop in
  added jobs to about 109,000. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1% in
  June. The Bureau of Labor also slashed the number of jobs added in recent
  months. May’s jobs figure was revised down by 125,000, from 144,000 to 19,000,
  and June was revised down by 133,000, from 147,000 to 14,000 – a combined
  258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. Hours after the data was
  released, Trump announced that he was firing the federal government official
  in charge of labor statistics, claiming, without evidence, that Erika
  McEntarfer, commissioner of labor statistics, had “faked” employment figures
  ahead of last year’s election. Healthcare and social assistance added 73,300
  jobs over the month but growth was dragged down by more cuts to federal
  workers. Twelve thousand federal jobs were lost in July and federal employment
  is down by 84,000 since reaching a peak in January. “There was little to
  celebrate in the July Employment Report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist
  for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to investors. He noted that the
  three-month average employment gain had now fallen to “a troublingly low
  35,000 – a figure that is difficult to interpret as anything other than a sign
  of hiring stalling, even as population growth slows.” Shortly before the
  latest official jobs data was published, two Federal Reserve policymakers who
  broke ranks with its other officials on interest rates earlier this week
  released statements explaining their respective decisions. The labor market
  “has become less dynamic and shows increasing signs of fragility”, said
  Michelle W Bowman, Fed vice-chair for supervision and a Trump appointee.
  Putting off a rate cut “could result in a deterioration in the labor market
  and a further slowing in economic growth”, she added. Christopher Waller,
  another Trump appointee, said waiting before cutting rates was “overly
  cautious”, adding: “I see no reason that we should hold the policy rate at its
  current level and risk a sudden decline in the labor market.” Trump, who has
  lambasted the Fed for months after it repeatedly opted to hold rates steady,
  welcomed the pair’s official interventions – and called on the central bank’s
  board to “assume control” of policy if Jerome Powell, the central bank’s
  chair, refuses to cut rates. The jobs report comes in a week packed with
  economic news. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that
  gross domestic product, a broad measure of the US’s economic health, grew at
  3% in the last three months, up from a 0.5% decline in the first quarter. The
  first quarter fall and second quarter bounceback were driven by Trump’s tariff
  policies as businesses stocked up on imports ahead of the levies at the start
  of the year – which cut growth – and cut back on imports in the second – which
  boosted growth. Taken together, the US economy grew at a sluggish 1.2% in the
  first six months of the year, down from the 2.5% average pace in 2024. Also on
  Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced it would not cut interest rates. The
  Fed is under intense pressure from Trump to cut rates but its chair said the
  central bank was still waiting to see what impact Trump’s tariffs will have on
  prices. “Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of
  some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation
  remain to be seen,” Powell said.
