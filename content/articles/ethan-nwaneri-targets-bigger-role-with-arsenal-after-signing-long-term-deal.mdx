  Ethan Nwaneri has said he feels at home at Arsenal after signing a new
  long-term deal and is determined to build on his breakthrough season. It is
  understood Nwaneri, the youngest Premier League debutant after playing for
  Arsenal aged 15 years and 181 days in 2022, has signed a five-year deal
  despite interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany. The 18-year-old was the
  youngest member of England’s victorious squad at this summer’s European
  Under-21 Championship and has made 39 appearances for Arsenal, scoring nine
  goals. In January he became only the third player, after Michael Owen and
  Wayne Rooney, to score three Premier League goals before his 18th birthday.
  Premier League regulations meant he had been using a separate changing room to
  the rest of Arsenal’s senior players until turning 18 in March and Nwaneri
  said on Friday he was looking forward to a bigger role at the club he joined
  as an eight-year-old. “Signing this contract means everything to me,” he said.
  “I see this as my first real season in men’s senior football, as part of the
  squad in the changing room. “I’m so excited for what I can bring to the team.
  I want to help us win as much as possible and bring happiness and glory to the
  club. This is where I feel at home. I think I’ve actually become more direct
  over the past few years and I’ve added more goals, so I’m excited for what
  will come next.” Along with Myles Lewis-Skelly, who also signed a new
  long-term Arsenal contract this summer after breaking into the first team and
  making his senior England debut last season, Nwaneri is regarded as one of the
  best young prospects to have emerged from Arsenal’s Hale End academy in recent
  years. Max Dowman has been tipped to follow in their footsteps and the
  15-year-old was praised by Mikel Arteta after Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat by
  Villarreal in a pre-season friendly on Wednesday, when Nwaneri started in
  midfield. “He continues to impress, without a doubt,” the manager said of
  Dowman. “The impact he had in the game again, the efficiency that he shows in
  every attack and action, it’s incredible. He deserves to have chances, and if
  he continues like this, let’s see what happens.” Arsenal start their season
  away against Manchester United on 17 August.
