  A teenager who listed Hitler, Mussolini and the Norwegian mass murderer Anders
  Breivik as his inspirations and who planned a terrorist attack on a mosque has
  been sentenced to 10 years in custody. The 17-year-old, who cannot be named
  because of his age, had intended to set fire to an Islamic centre in Greenock,
  Inverclyde, after befriending the imam and mapping out the building’s interior
  on his phone. The teenager was arrested at the door of the centre in January
  this year. He was carrying a military-style rucksack that contained a
  German-manufactured Glock-type air pistol, ammunition, ball bearings, gas
  cartridges and aerosol cans, according to prosecutors. He was sentenced at the
  high court in Glasgow on Thursday after pleading guilty to two terrorism
  charges, with a further eight years of supervision on licence upon release. In
  his sentencing statement, Lord Arthurson said: “What you had in mind was what
  can properly be characterised as a quite diabolical atrocity involving extreme
  violence and multiple deaths. You even requested that your attack be
  livestreamed. Your conduct was only stopped by your arrest, when you were
  quite literally at the very door of the centre.” Prosecutors said the
  teenager, who became radicalised online, began plotting the attack in December
  2024 and joined the mosque’s WhatsApp group saying he was “looking for
  guidance”, later winning the trust of the imam during several visits.
  Meanwhile he was boasting of his plans to set the centre on fire on the social
  media platform Telegram and later filmed himself wandering the corridors,
  including footage showing him superimposing a hand carrying a semi-automatic
  pistol. Sineidin Corrins, deputy procurator fiscal for specialist casework at
  the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, said: “This heinous plan to
  attack those within his own local community was prepared and driven by racial
  and religiously motivated hatred, and showed that he not only held neo-Nazi
  beliefs but was about to act on them to cause pain and suffering”.
