  The television writer Ann McManus, who has died aged 67 after suffering a
  cardiac arrest, was the key creator and writer behind the hit TV series
  Waterloo Road, and a co-founder of the multimillion-pound company Shed
  Productions. She landed her first TV job as a scriptwriter on the soap Take
  the High Road in 1993, before graduating to Coronation Street (1996-98), while
  still working as a schoolteacher in Glasgow. Her fast-paced, often funny style
  impressed Brian Park, the producer. In 1998, he instructed her to get rid of a
  few Coronation Street characters that he thought were stale, including that of
  Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh. McManus had a brilliant idea:
  she would make Cropper the first trans character in a British soap, in what
  became a remarkably popular storyline. Another storyline she devised was
  sending Deirdre Rachid, a key character, played by Anne Kirkbride, to prison,
  unjustly convicted of fraud. A public “Free the Weatherfield One” campaign
  ensued, leading to the prime minister, Tony Blair, commenting on the case in
  parliament. In 2005, when asked by John Yorke, BBC controller of drama, to
  come up with a contemporary series that would be relevant to the lives of
  ordinary people in modern Britain, McManus pitched a show set around a
  comprehensive school. “If there is one single issue that dominates the
  thinking not only of parents but of everyone who wants a decent and fair
  society, it’s how we give our children the best start in life,” McManus said
  at the press launch of Waterloo Road in 2007. In the show, Waterloo
  comprehensive is a fictional, failing school in the north of England, which
  slowly gets back on its feet. McManus’s vast knowledge of the world of
  teaching (she had spent five years teaching English at some of Glasgow’s
  toughest comprehensive schools) shone through in the scripts, earning it
  accolades far and wide. Shed Productions (later Shed Media) was established in
  1999 by McManus, Park, Eileen Gallagher and Maureen Chadwick, who had all met
  while working for Granada Television. Their first production proposal, Bad
  Girls, set in a women’s prison, was commissioned by ITV in 1998. Featuring
  British TV’s first long-term lesbian relationship, it quickly acquired cult
  status, with fan clubs popping up across the UK. In 2000, Shed won a major new
  commission to produce Footballers’ Wives for primetime ITV. In 2005 came a
  drama series, The Fugitives, about two runaway teenagers. Shed was also behind
  other hugely successful programmes such as Supernanny for Channel 4 and a
  number of other high-profile dramas for both ITV and the BBC, within its first
  decade, selling its formats and content in over 200 territories worldwide. The
  buyout by Warner Brothers that was completed in 2013, and which valued the
  company at £100m, netted McManus and the other executives payouts of £3.8m, as
  well as shares in the company. On the day of sale, she celebrated by burning
  all the scripts on a large open fire. But soon she was writing again, this
  time on a drama about the Irish famine. McManus was born in Ayr, to James
  McManus, a railwayman, and Frances (nee News), who started out as a PA, but
  was sacked when she became pregnant, and went on to raise six children (of
  whom Ann was the second), later becoming a teacher for children with special
  needs. Ann’s early education was at St John’s Ayr primary school, then Queen
  Margaret Academy, a local Catholic comprehensive school at which she did not
  shine, and “mucked up” her highers. After a period working in a call centre,
  she resat them and finally made it to Glasgow University in her early 20s.
  There, she became a very active member of the Communist party (which she left
  in the early 1990s). It was during this time she met Peter Breeze, whom she
  married in 1980. She completed her BA in English language and literature at
  Glasgow and followed it up with a postgraduate diploma in education, studying
  for it in her own time while training as a teacher at Jordanhill College. Her
  passion for education came out of her own experience – as a child born into a
  teaching family, as a pupil, and as a teacher in schools serving two of
  Glasgow’s most deprived housing estates, Castlemilk and Easterhouse. At the
  start of her teaching career, corporal punishment was still permitted – but
  she found it far more effective to encourage the class to laugh at the
  ringleaders than to martyr them via the cane. “Some of the pupils I taught
  were genuinely tough cases but they all had their crosses to bear. Many were
  living in chaotic homes where school was first and foremost a refuge,” she
  once remarked. In 2008, recognising that the industry really needed new
  writers, she created, with Gallagher, an MA in television fiction writing at
  Glasgow Caledonian University. In later years, she loved overseas travel, and
  her favourite London pastime was lunch, often raucous affairs with her friends
  from the Shed days. McManus was a keen singer, having formed a band during her
  retirement, and lent her enthusiastic support to lesbian and gay campaigns,
  such as LGB Alliance UK. Breeze and McManus divorced in 1990. She entered into
  a civil partnership with Gallagher in 2006. She is survived by Gallagher and
  by her five siblings, Veronica, Jim, David, Helen and Frances. • Ann McManus,
  screenwriter, born 6 October 1957; died 16 August 2025
