  Freedom Orchestra hit the UK

  ‘People often ask me about my work with Ukrainian musicians,” says the
  Canadian-Ukrainian conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson. “They will say things like,
  ‘How are things out there? We don’t hear much about the war, I guess it’s all
  calmed down a bit.’ When I hear that I want to scream, ‘No, it really hasn’t
  calmed down!’.” Wilson established the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra in the
  weeks after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. With
  her husband, Peter Gelb, general manager of New York’s Metropolitan Opera, she
  contacted leaders of the world’s top international orchestras and located
  dozens of elite Ukrainian musicians – some working in western Europe, some who
  had fled Russia, others performing in Kyiv, Lviv or Odesa – to establish a
  75-piece “battalion of culture” who would assemble for a few weeks each year.
  The UFO were stars of the 2022 Proms, earned rave reviews around the world,
  received a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon, and toured their
  titanic version of Beethoven’s Ninth in 2023 and 2024, translating Schiller’s
  lyric into Ukrainian and turning his “ode to joy” into a declaration of “Slava
  Ukraini” (Glory to Ukraine). However, after three and a half years of
  relentless conflict, Wilson admits that the orchestra may be a victim of
  compassion fatigue. “There’s a danger that the world could lose interest, just
  as the Russian bombing gets ever more brutal, and as more and more Ukrainians
  are killed. I guess the only way we can get that story across is to keep on
  fighting through music.” The orchestra members, many of whom are based in
  Kyiv, can attest to the relentless bombardment they face on a day-to-day
  basis. “I might be playing a small chamber concert one evening, which is
  suddenly interrupted by air raid sirens,” says Vladyslav Primakov, a cellist
  with the UFO as well as the Kyiv Philharmonic and the National House of Music.
  “You have to stop what you are doing, take cover for an hour, and then get
  back on stage, re-establish your rapport with the audience, and then try and
  enter a space of sensitivity all over again. Then I return home to my wife and
  five-year-old daughter, and I might get an hour of sleep, amid the drone
  attacks. It is exhausting.” “It is very scary,” confirms UFO double bassist
  Nazarii Stets, who also plays with several other Kyiv ensembles. “We all have
  apps on our phones which give air raid warnings. Sometimes you see neighbours
  who sleep in the underground stations because it is safer. And then you have
  to go to rehearsals the next morning after zero sleep, and you are shattered.
  Of course, we are not on the frontline, about to kill or be killed. These
  people are the true heroes. But, as musicians, our instruments are our
  weapons.” At the moment, orchestra members like Stets and Primakov are among
  an elite of men of fighting age – alongside sportsmen, academics, scientists
  and certain caregivers – who are given dispensation to avoid military service,
  something reviewed every two years. This is a cause of resentment for some
  drafted Ukrainians. One foreign-based musician in the UFO was the object of
  his brother’s anger for not returning to Ukraine to volunteer. “There are some
  musicians who have remained in exile and avoided the draft,” says Stets. “I
  guess they, like footballers and boxers, are representing Ukraine on the world
  stage, fighting for us culturally. But I understand why some are uncomfortable
  with that.” It may seem frivolous for Ukrainian musicians to be playing
  concerts at this moment, or for the Ukrainian government to maintain an arts
  programme as it fights for its very survival, but it recalls a famous wartime
  quote often attributed to Winston Churchill. When asked to cut the arts budget
  to aid the war effort, he is said to have responded: “So what are we fighting
  for?” It is a crucial point for Wilson. “Culture is our soul,” she says. “It’s
  what gives Ukrainians their identity. We have to maintain and expand that. I
  receive letters from soldiers on the frontline, saying thank you for your
  support, thank you for fighting for us. Soldiers come to our concerts, they
  watch us on YouTube and social media. We have performed for soldiers in rehab,
  some blinded in battle, and we were overwhelmed by their support.” Wilson has
  strong ties to Ukraine – her ancestors emigrated from Chernivtsi a century ago
  to join thelarge Ukrainian community in Winnipeg, Canada – and she is close to
  two cousins from the Bukovina region who are now serving as military
  volunteers. She spends six weeks a year as music director of the Kyiv
  Camerata, Ukraine’s leading chamber orchestra, and is learning Ukrainian; she
  was already fluent in French, Italian, German and Russian when she launched
  the UFO. “I initially tried conversing with Ukrainian musicians in Russian.
  But you realise that this is now verboten, even for those in the
  Russian-speaking areas of the east.” It is a sore subject. “From 24 February
  2022, I decided that no Russian will be spoken from my lips,” says Stets.
  “And, likewise, no Russian music from my hand. We have a limited amount of
  time, and I would rather spend my time developing and championing the
  Ukrainian repertoire.” “I, too, can no longer play Russian music,” says
  Primakov. “Same with Russian books, films, TV, art – anything Russian is
  cursed. It is terrible to think this way, but it has become instinctive.” The
  repertoire for this tour features a new work by Ukrainian composer Maxim
  Kolomiiets. His opera, The Mothers of Kherson, with a libretto by American
  playwright George Brant, will be premiered next year, in a co-production
  between the Met and the Polish National Opera, but here will be previewed as a
  15-minute suite. “It is a remarkable piece, about the tens of thousands of
  Ukrainian children who have been kidnapped by Russia,” says Primakov. “There
  are parts that sound like a lullaby, but you quickly realise that the lullaby
  is being sung by someone who is trying to comfort the mother of an abducted
  child. It is rare to play such a devastating and resonant contemporary work.”
  The programme also includes the Prelude and Liebestod from Wagner’s Tristan
  and Isolde (“That moves me to tears every time,” says Primakov) as well as
  Beethoven’s Fifth: “I once saw the Fifth as something dark and tragic. But now
  I see an air of defiance. It embodies our fighting spirit. It reminds us that
  we are soldiers, too.” “Our repertoire must send a strong message, and the
  Fifth was not a light choice,” says Wilson. “The opening four notes were
  famously used as a sign of resistance in occupied Europe during the second
  world war, and the BBC used it during blitzkrieg. It is about resilience. It
  reminds us that art is a political weapon. Every time I go to Ukraine, I
  realise that I am playing Russian roulette, I could be killed. But I would
  rather fight than not do anything. My baton is my weapon.” • The Ukraine
