  Depending on whose forecasts you believe, in the autumn budget the UK
  chancellor needs to find £25-£50bn to cover day-to-day spending, let alone to
  raise the extra funds needed to turnaround crumbling public services or end
  the two-child benefit cap. Rachel Reeves is bound by a manifesto commitment
  not to raise the big three – income tax, national insurance or VAT – and
  having already slapped businesses with a national insurance rise in her
  inaugural budget last year, she faces having to think about creative ways to
  raise revenue. The past few weeks, we have seen a bewildering parade of
  policies emerging from Treasury sources. These include reforms to inheritance
  tax, replacing stamp duty with a national proportional property tax for homes
  worth more than £500,000, replacing council tax with a local proportional
  property tax levied on house values up to £500,000 with a minimum annual bill
  of £800 paid by the property owner, and a potential capital gains tax (CGT) on
  primary residences valued at more than £1.5m. The government is right that
  Britain’s property tax system is in desperate need of reform. The current
  council tax system is regressive and outdated, based on property values from
  1991, and stamp duty is a punitive brake on mobility. However, the solutions
  being floated risk creating new problems while failing to solve the old ones.
  Take the proposed mansion tax by another name: a CGT on primary homes worth
  more than £1.5m. In principle, it targets unearned wealth gains on the most
  valuable properties. But once you do the maths, its flaws become glaringly
  apparent. Unlike second homes or buy-to-lets, a primary residence has always
  been exempt from CGT. Introducing it would create a huge disincentive for
  people to sell. It would trap older homeowners in houses too large for them,
  stifling the property market for families below. Other proposals the
  government is looking at, including a new tax on homes sold for more than
  £500,000, are thin on detail. (Although they are reportedly underpinned by a
  wider set of reforms in a paper from the thinktank Onward.) The tax would only
  kick in once you sell; it is not yet clear how this would differ substantially
  from stamp duty. In this same set of proposals, a £500,000 threshold is also
  applied for those paying more towards a new property tax that would replace
  council tax. Such a threshold risks many ordinary people who own their
  properties in London and the south-east struggling to pay. For renters, this
  new property tax is paid by the owner. However, there is no modelling on
  probable ripple effects on rental prices. Making London even more unaffordable
  to live in will not help Reeves’s economic growth prospects in the short term.
  Adding council tax bands for the most expensive homes is a potential
  short-term solution to help ease the inherent unfairness at the top, but it
  would not address regional price disparities. There are more progressive
  approaches to council tax, such as those set out by Fairer Share, which
  advocates for an annual flat-rate tax that would see the wealthiest pay more
  and any increase in local taxes capped to protect the “asset-rich cash-poor”.
  Here is the crucial issue with the focus on property taxes: while most people
  hold their wealth primarily in their property, the richest do not. A 2020
  study by the Resolution Foundation, using data from 2016 to 2018, found that
  on average in households with assets of £5m or more, property accounted for
  less than 20% of their total wealth. Instead, the wealth of the top 1% is
  dominated by stocks, shares, bonds and other financial investments. Financial
  wealth is significantly more prevalent in the wealthiest households and is a
  major driver of their rising net worth and inequality. Inheritance tax does
  take forms of wealth beyond property into account, but here we come up against
  a significant political barrier. Understandably, people have an emotional
  connection with wanting to leave their homes to their kids, particularly amid
  a housing affordability crisis that has for many made it close to impossible
  to get on the property ladder without family support. Both the design and the
  communications of any reforms to this tax must focus on truly large dynastic
  wealth – by reforming the sorts of trusts that allowed the previous Duke of
  Westminster to pass on £9bn to his son without paying inheritance tax – rather
  than the modest wealth of ordinary families, otherwise it risks a huge
  political fallout. This brings us back to a straightforward annual wealth tax.
  A modest levy of 2% on individual net wealth exceeding £10m. It is focused on
  inequality. It would raise substantial revenue; estimates suggest more than
  £24bn annually. And crucially, it applies to total net wealth (including
  assets such as stocks, bonds and property, minus debts). And no –
  well-designed wealth taxes in Europe have not caused the capital flight
  critics often prophesied, and dodgy data flouted in recent months has been
  found to be wildly exaggerated. The political argument is just as powerful.
  Polling consistently shows it is very popular, with 75% of the public backing
  a wealth tax, including Reform UK voters. Of course, given that we don’t know
  the full value of what the richest have, there are administrative hurdles, but
  these are not insurmountable. The chancellor should announce more resources
  for HMRC to do the much-needed scoping work, and we can learn lessons from
  wealth taxes in comparable European countries. People in the UK need to feel a
  real improvement to their quality of life. If they don’t, this government
  simply won’t last long enough to bring in any of the changesit is proposing.
  Instead of tinkering around the edges, with a wealth tax the government could
  win the argument on fairness – and finally start to reverse toxic wealth
  inequality in this country. Faiza Shaheen is executive director of Tax Justice
