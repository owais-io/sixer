  Another book on the Beatles? It’s hard to imagine a writer shedding new light
  on the band given the mountain of literature already in existence. But there
  is a freshness of perspective in Ian Leslie’s book, which tells of Lennon and
  McCartney’s unique alchemy through the songs they wrote together. Leslie’s
  background in psychology serves him well in a study that jettisons the usual
  narrative of male rivalry; their partnership, Leslie suggests, was closer to a
  marriage. He begins with the pair’s early songwriting sessions, usually in
  McCartney’s front room, where rather than each taking ownership of songs, they
  worked in sync. Other fabled musical partnerships such as Leiber and Stoller,
  or Rodgers and Hammerstein, divided the labour between lyrics and melody, but
  Lennon and McCartney worked together on both. Pointing to their profound
  connection, Leslie notes how in the song If I Fell they performed “an
  intricate courtship dance, moving apart and close again as the song unfolds,
  like birds weaving in and out of each other’s flight path, alternately
  shielding and leading the other”. The Thick of It actor Chris Addison is the
  book’s fluent and engaging narrator, and his enthusiasm for the topic is
  clear. The audio edition also has a bonus chapter featuring a terrific
  conversation between Leslie and presenter and podcaster Geoff Lloyd, where
  they ponder the continued enthusiasm for all things Beatles: “In terms of
  scale and complexity of achievement, there’s very few people who come close to
  what John and Paul did,” says Leslie. “People say ‘Do we need more books about
  the Beatles?’ It’s only just begun, in my view.” • Available via Faber, 14hr
