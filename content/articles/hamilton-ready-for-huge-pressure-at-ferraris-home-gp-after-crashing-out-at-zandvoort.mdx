  Lewis Hamilton has admitted the pressure is on as he prepares to make his
  debut as a Ferrari driver at the team’s home race in the Italian Grand Prix
  this weekend, having unceremoniously crashed out of the Dutch GP on Sunday
  after an unforced error. The seven-time world champion suffered an unusual
  exit at Zandvoort as he went wide on the painted surface outside turn three,
  made slippery by light rain. He lost the rear and could not hold the car,
  which slid into the barriers, ending his race. It was far from the fresh start
  after the summer break the British driver had hoped for after he has endured a
  difficult debut year with Ferrari. The car has been off the pace and adapting
  to a new team has proved difficult for Hamilton, as he admitted after his exit
  at Zandvoort. “There’s obviously a huge amount of pressure on us as a team,
  more so for me now,” he said. “I haven’t had a good season. Next week, we’ll
  just try to absorb all the energy from the fans.” He did maintain that he
  remained confident and felt the weekend in the Netherlands had been a step
  forward for him and the team after he had been left disenchanted after a
  series of poor results before F1’s summer break. “I’m fine, I feel fine
  mentally, I’ve felt lots of positives,” he said. “I felt I was making
  progress, I was catching the car ahead. It’s tough to have a result like that
  but I’ve been racing for so long I’ve had God knows how many races and you can
  probably count on one hand that sort of incident.” However, he already faces a
  setback for Monza, with a five-place grid penalty for the race imposed for
  failing to slow sufficiently for yellow flags on his reconnaissance lap to the
  grid before Sunday’s race. The Ferrari team principal, Fred Vasseur,
  maintained his driver was still feeling optimistic. “We discussed after the
  race – he was much more positive than the last four or five events,” Vasseur
  said. “For sure, he lost the car but the mood was positive, because I think he
  can take a lot of positives from the weekend and build up the confidence for
  Monza.” A difficult weekend for Ferrari, who are in a tight fight with
  Mercedes for second place in the championship – the Italian team are just 12
  points ahead of third – was compounded when Charles Leclerc clashed with
  Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli, and the Monegasque driver spun into the barriers,
  ending his race. Antonelli had been going up the inside as Leclerc was on the
  racing line when they clipped wheels on lap 53 and as a result the Italian was
  given a 10-second penalty. Hamilton had said before the weekend he wanted to
  start to try to enjoy driving for Ferrari after a trying time and all the
  scrutiny around his move to the Scuderia. Vasseur insisted that he felt his
  team was on course to potentially bring a smile to the driver’s face. “To
  enjoy it, it’s largely a matter of results, confidence, pace and the fact that
  you are in the game,” he said on Sunday. “I think, honestly, today is why
  Lewis had the perception that today was much better, even if the outcome is
  not.” After the race in Zandvoort, the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff,
  also confirmed George Russell would remain with the team for 2026, alongside
  Antonelli, although the British driver’s contract has yet to be signed. “I
  always say there’s not going to be any big news because we’re doing this.
  We’re continuing with both of them, of course,” he said. With Red Bull’s Max
  Verstappen having already confirmed he would remain with the team for 2026,
  there was little doubt Mercedes would stick with Russell, though the final
  details of his contract and its length remain to be confirmed.
