  Nicola Sturgeon’s month-long promotional tour for her memoir Frankly comes to
  an end this Friday at the Southbank Centre in London, the city, according to
  one of many carefully placed publication interviews, where she is considering
  moving to escape the “goldfish bowl scrutiny” of Scotland. The former first
  minister’s political memoir has generated a blizzard of headlines since its
  launch on 12 August. Some were diverting but ultimately inconsequential, like
  her choice of future base, others rubbed salt in raw wounds, reprising two of
  the most divisive episodes in the SNP’s recent history – the Scottish
  government’s investigation into allegations of sexual harassment made against
  her predecessor Alex Salmond, and her flagship gender recognition law changes.
  Her many critics reacted with fury at Sturgeon’s refusal to back down on her
  position that those changes were weaponised by forces on the far right. Her
  depiction of her former mentor Salmond, who died last autumn, as a lazy,
  bullying opportunist was denounced as “cowardly” and “cruel” by his surviving
  family. Sturgeon herself has faced a fierce online backlash. But as the hot
  takes cool, what impact has Sturgeon’s re-emergence had on the party she once
  lead? You will find plenty in the SNP who are privately irked by the timing of
  Frankly’s release, nine months before the Holyrood elections, when she will
  step down after serving as an MSP since this Scottish parliament’s inception.
  As one former MP says bluntly: “Rehashing all these things ahead of the
  election is bad for the party. She could have served her term until 2026, but
  publishing now only serves herself.” Others found Frankly an ultimately
  unsatisfactory read, with too many questions unanswered and a sense that, with
  so much still in the balance, it was premature to consider this the final word
  on Sturgeon’s legacy. While contempt of court laws conveniently precluded
  Sturgeon addressing the forthcoming trial of her former husband and ex-SNP
  chief executive Peter Murrell for alleged embezzlement of party funds, there
  were other marked omissions: how her presidential style of leadership hollowed
  out the party, her lack of succession planning, as well as the gaping failures
  of her government to tackle the attainment gap, ferries, drugs deaths, to name
  a few. But the response, as with so many things about Sturgeon, and as she
  acknowledges repeatedly in Frankly, is polarised. One SNP politician who was
  inspired to stand by Sturgeon said: “I’m reading it less as political and more
  personal. Nicola talks in the book about ‘wheesht for independence’ [the idea
  that any party troubles should be swept under the carpet lest they impede the
  cause] and she has every right to tell her side of the story.” SNP HQ may have
  been “a bit head in hands”, as one former Westminster figure puts it, but
  Sturgeon remains hugely popular with many members. The fondness was evident at
  book events, alongside a palpable nostalgia. Sturgeon reminds people of who
  they were when she was in her prime, blanketed in the optimism of the
  independence referendum campaign, before Brexit, Covid and the entrenching
  culture war. This is shared not only by those of Sturgeon’s generation but
  younger progressives. “Everyone I know is reading Frankly,” said one
  twentysomething activist, describing “a sense of loss for the independence
  movement that felt that much more inclusive and progressive a decade ago”.
  This taps into broader discontent, a month after Mhairi Black, the party’s
  rising star of the 2015 landslide, quit the party over its current stance on
  trans rights and Gaza. Another former MP said: “A lot of us are questioning
  whether the party is a natural fit for us any more. We’d like [current FM]
  John Swinney to bring out some bold and ambitious policies ahead of the
  election and I’ve not seen that. We look like a party that’s already given
  up.” While the SNP is leading the Holyrood polls this summer, others recognise
  the manifold challenges facing Swinney ahead of next May: defending a patchy
  record, the rise of Reform, falling membership and diminishing funds. And a
  succession of experienced SNP women are stepping down next May, including the
  highly rated deputy first minister Kate Forbes. “To lose Kate, a clever woman
  who could reach out across the entire chamber and to business, is a huge
  loss,” said one senior MSP, “and it makes things more difficult for the 2026
  campaign.” Despite initial suggestions that Forbes’s exist might move the
  party leftwards, they counter: “John is a realist and understands the bigger
  picture. The general mood of the public right now is not leftwing and the rise
  of Reform shows that.” After the initial publicity hoopla, on sober reflection
  many the Guardian spoke to were relieved at Frankly’s lack of seismic
  revelations. As one veteran activist said: “No one in my circle thinks it will
  have an impact on the election. There was nothing in it that made you think:
  ‘We’re going to have to stand on the doorstep and defend this.’”
