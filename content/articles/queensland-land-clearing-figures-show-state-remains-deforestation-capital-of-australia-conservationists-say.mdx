  Forest and woodland across an area more than 1,000 times the size of the
  Sydney CBD was bulldozed in Queensland in 2022-23, newly published figures
  show, sparking warnings the state is escalating risks to endangered species
  and worsening climate change. Almost half (44%) of the 332,015 hectares of
  clearing was in Great Barrier Reef catchment areas, causing nutrient and
  sediment flow that puts additional pressure on corals already bleaching due to
  climate change. The state government land-clearing data for 2022-23, published
  this week, shows overall clearing was up 3% on the previous year. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Of the clearing, 21% (70,799 hectares) was remnant
  woodland, meaning it had not been cleared before or that it resembled
  uncleared forest, an increase of 8%. Remnant vegetation is important for
  biodiversity and supports endangered species such as the koala and greater
  glider. Dave Copeman, the director of the Queensland Conservation Council, the
  state’s peak conservation body, said the figures were “shocking”.
  “Queenslanders and international visitors alike would be distressed to learn
  that the Queensland government is allowing forests and woodlands to be
  bulldozed in the Great Barrier Reef catchment at an alarming rate, with over
  140,000 hectares being cleared per year,” he said. “This is devastating
  additional pressure on an already damaged Great Barrier Reef struggling to
  survive from repeated mass bleaching events. This clearing must stop.” • Sign
  up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a
  free newsletter The Australian Conservation Foundation’s Nathaniel Pelle said
  the figures showed Queensland “remains the deforestation capital of Australia”
  and the government needed to tighten regulations. “It is sadly no longer
  surprising to see big numbers coming out of Queensland when it comes to
  deforestation but what is most alarming is the jump in destruction of remnant
  forests and woodland, which is catastrophic for Queensland’s wildlife and
  proves the state’s vegetation management is not working,” he said. About 86%
  of the clearing (283,918ha) was for the expansion of pasture and 77%
  (254,647ha) was category X clearing, which means it did not require a permit
  under the state’s vegetation management laws. The Brigalow and Mulga Lands
  regions were clearing hotspots. The figures show that 33,000 hectares of
  woodland and forest bulldozed was unexplained, which can include potentially
  unlawful clearing. According to the report, less than 1% (3,040ha) of the
  total area bulldozed was in places containing endangered ecosystems, but this
  was 21% more than the previous year, which Copeman said was “distressing”. He
  said much of the pastoral clearing was also not being assessed for its
  environmental impact under Australia’s nature laws and the council was calling
  on the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, to address this in upcoming
  reforms. Hannah Schuch, the Queensland campaigns manager at the Wilderness
  Society, said the state was the centre of Australia’s land-clearing crisis and
  conversion of land for pasture was the main driver of the destruction. “These
  aren’t just stats. Bulldozing forests and bushland across the sunshine state
  kills species like the koala, red goshawk and greater glider, smothers the
  Great Barrier Reef with chemical and sediment pollution and worsens climate
  change,” she said. “Forests and bushland in Queensland are quite literally the
  lungs of our state yet government and corporate inaction continues to deal
  them this destructive hand.” Release of the Queensland data follows the
  publication of New South Wales figures last week which revealed a 40% surge in
  land clearing across the state. Comment has been sought from the Queensland
  government.
