  Tim, 62, London Occupation Retired software engineer Voting record Labour, but
  Liberal Democrats when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader. Says he’s centre left.
  Voted remain in the EU referendum Amuse bouche Last year, Tim went to Burning
  Man festival. He wore a boiler suit covered in LEDs, which “was way too
  bright, and annoyed everybody” Lewis, 27, Essex Occupation Logistics manager
  Voting record Always Conservative and has been a Tory councillor. Voted leave
  in the EU referendum. Describes himself as centre right Amuse bouche Lewis
  plans to visit every European country by the time he turns 30. He’s still got
  nine to go, including Russia and Ukraine For starters Lewis I was early but
  Tim was already there. He was very approachable, a good listener. Obviously,
  there was an age difference, but no awkward moments and conversation flowed.
  Tim The restaurant was loud, but the food was delicious. We shared starters –
  trout in coconut milk and their take on a fish finger sandwich. For mains, we
  both had half a smoked chicken. First impressions of Lewis: a well-turned-out,
  respectable young man. Lewis We talked about our jobs. I did history at
  university, after which I chose logistics over the civil service, mainly
  because I thought I’d be sitting down too much with the civil service. I’ve
  never been one to sit down. Tim I did engineering at university, and worked in
  video games software. He did a master’s in political history. I was worried he
  might use examples from history to back up his points, but there wasn’t too
  much of that. The big beef Lewis We had a clear difference of opinion around
  criminal justice. The current system, to my eyes, is broken, a never-ending
  cycle of repeat offending. I believe when someone goes to prison they
  shouldn’t be locked up 23 hours a day doing nothing; there needs to be a focus
  on rehabilitation. Tim It was good that he mentioned rehabilitation. Lewis The
  divergence between us came when, for example, somebody commits a home
  burglary, goes to prison for two years, reoffends and gets five years, with an
  even greater focus on rehabilitation, but then commits a third burglary.
  That’s when I think we need to accept that person is beyond rehabilitation and
  they should spend the rest of their life behind bars. Tim Clearly, that’s
  something I wouldn’t be comfortable with. It’s totally out of proportion: just
  three strikes, whatever the crime, and you’re locked up for ever. I mean, we’d
  have to build loads of new prisons. How would that be paid for? Sharing plate
  Lewis We both want a safety net, and for us to be a compassionate country. Tim
  On voting systems, we both think first past the post is good because it leads
  to stronger governments that get stuff done. Neither of us can stand Trump –
  though I did point out that, rather scarily, some of his policies, such as
  tariffs, have probably achieved what he wanted them to. For afters Lewis There
  was a minor disagreement on the two-child benefit cap. I think it’s
  unaffordable to change it, and it shouldn’t be a priority for the government.
  There are better uses for the money. A lot of people in work make that
  calculation – can I afford another child? – and decide not to have more. That
  choice should be there for people on welfare as well. Tim The
  principle-of-choice argument is all very well, but not everyone can do that:
  pregnancies are sometimes unplanned; people can’t always figure out the
  finance side; or they lose their jobs. And the people who suffer here are the
  children. Takeaways Lewis One of the sad things about politics, and the
  country in general, is how polarising it is, and if two people have different
  opinions, somehow they’re enemies. One of the things I like about this column
  is that two people with different opinions can have a friendly meal together.
  We both said how much we enjoyed it. Tim It was a really good opportunity to
  turn over these sorts of arguments in a great environment. You don’t normally
  get into that stuff with a stranger. I was just surprised there was this one
  thing – three strikes – that stood out like a sore thumb. I’d be curious to
  see whether Lewis still holds that view in 10 years’ time. Additional
