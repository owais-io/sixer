  A man has been charged with murder after an ice-cream seller died in London,
  police said. Shazad Khan, 41, was pronounced dead at the scene after officers
  responded to reports of an altercation in Monks Park, Wembley, at 6.10pm on
  Tuesday. Zaher Zaarour, 26, of Brent, north-west London, has been charged with
  murder and possession of a bladed article, the Metropolitan police said on
  Thursday. He is due to appear at Willesden magistrates court on Friday. A
  31-year-old woman who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of conspiracy to
  murder had been bailed pending further inquiries, the force added.
  Metropolitan police DCI Paul Waller said: “I would like to thank the community
  for their help and support during this investigation. “Residents can expect to
  see an increase of officers in the local area over the next coming days as the
  investigation continues.” One local man told the PA news agency that Khan was
  “famous” in the area for selling ice-creams in a van. Asim Mahmood Butt, 39,
  who lives in nearby Tokyngton Avenue, said he was a childhood friendof the
  victim, who had started selling ice-cream “about a year ago”. He added that
  Khan was married and had a young daughter. The ice-cream van, which had been
  parked on the road at the time of the incident, was well known locally for
  having a large teddy bear, Butt said.
