  Texas Democrats in the state legislature denied Republicans a legislative
  quorum on Monday by leaving the state, preventing, at least for now, plans
  proposed by the White House to aggressively redistrict Texas’s congressional
  lines in their favor. When the legislature gaveled in at 3pm local time on
  Monday, Republicans fell short of a quorum by eight votes after Democrats fled
  to Illinois, a legislative conference in Boston, New York and elsewhere. In an
  extraordinary escalation, the state’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, said
  he had ordered the Texas department of public safety to “locate, arrest and
  return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to
  Texans”. “There are consequences for dereliction of duty,” Abbott said in a
  statement on Monday, after the Republican-dominated house issued civil arrest
  warrants in an attempt to compel the return of the members who fled. “This
  order will remain in effect until all missing Democrat House members are
  accounted for and brought to the Texas Capitol.” Enforcing Abbott’s order will
  be difficult, however, because Democrats who left the state are beyond the
  jurisdiction of Texas authorities. Democrats hold 62 of the 150 seats in the
  legislature’s lower chamber, so as long as at least 51 members remain out of
  Austin, the Texas legislature cannot move forward with any votes, including a
  plan sought by Donald Trump to redraw the state’s congressional maps to give
  Republicans five more seats in Congress. The Texas speaker, Representative
  Dustin Burrows, adjourned the house until 1pm on Tuesday after issuing a call
  for absent lawmakers and threatening their arrest. He cited pending
  legislation on flood relief and human trafficking – and not the contentious
  redistricting proposal before the chamber – in his call for Democrats to
  return. “Instead of confronting those challenges, some of our colleagues have
  fled the state in their duty,” Burrows said. “They’ve left the state,
  abandoned their posts and turned their backs on the constituents they swore to
  represent. They’ve shirked their responsibilities under the direction and
  pressure of out-of-state politicians and activists who don’t know the first
  thing about what’s right for Texas.” Democrats pushed back forcefully,
  accusing Abbott of calling a special session at Trump’s behest rather than
  prioritizing disaster relief in the aftermath of the catastrophic floods that
  killed 135 people in central Texas last month. “I never thought as a Texan, as
  an elected member of the Texas House of Representatives, and now as an elected
  member from Texas to the United States House of Representatives, that I would
  see the governor of the proud state of Texas bend a knee to a felon from New
  York,” Texas congresswoman Julie Johnson taunted Abbott during a press
  conference in Illinois. “Never thought I’d see the day, but here we are.”
  Johnson, whose district would be radically reshaped if Texas Republicans
  succeed, spoke alongside members of the Illinois congressional delegation as
  well as several of the state representatives who left Texas on Sunday. “Texas
  House Democrats know how to fight,” said Texas state representative Jessica
  González. “Our sleeves are rolled up, and we’re ready to take this fight
  wherever it’s going to take us, because our communities, our state and our
  nation is definitely worth fighting for.” Texas attorney general Ken Paxton,
  who fled his own impeachment hearings and refused a court order to release his
  travel records after speaking at the rally in Washington that preceded the
  January 6 insurrection, has described wayward Democratic legislators as
  “cowards”. Speaker Burrows said the house would not sit quietly. “While you
  obstruct the work of the people, the people of Texas are watching and so is
  the nation, and if you choose to continue down this road, you should know
  there will be consequences.” The Texas House Democratic caucus said in
  response: “Come and take it.” “We are not fighting for the Democratic party,”
  state representative James Talarico said in a video message recorded at an
  airport. “We are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not
  be higher. We have to take a stand.” A few dozen protesters gathered in front
  of the governor’s mansion in Austin on Monday to protest the Republicans’
  hasty rewriting of the state’s congressional districts. Led by Democratic
  congressmen Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett, protesters marched back and forth
  across the parking lot in front of the gates of the governor’s mansion.
  Speaking into a bullhorn, Casar, a leading progressive, praised state
  Democrats for fleeing the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need to
  pass a new congressional map that would sharply dilute Democratic voting
  strength in an effort to preserve a Republican majority in next year’s
  congressional midterms. President Lyndon B Johnson signed the Voting Rights
  Act in 1965 to “prevent maps like this”, Casar said. “We’re going to fight
  like hell to stop it,” he said. “We’re not going back to pre-1965.” “I see him
  basically as an errand boy for President Trump,” Doggett said of the Texas
  governor, Greg Abbott. “He didn’t ask for this map, he’s just following
  orders.” “Governor Abbott could have easily passed flood relief on day one of
  this special session,” Casar added. “Instead he’s holding flood relief hostage
  … It’s all about himself and Donald Trump.” Every Republican member of the
  Texas congressional delegation that Casar has discussed the map with has told
  him privately that they oppose the redistricting effort, he said. Republicans
  have worried since Trump first floated the redistricting plan that any attempt
  to redraw the state’s congressional districts could backfire, since creating
  new right-leaning districts is hard to do without making existing red
  districts less conservative. Most of the Democratic caucus absconded to
  Chicago, a city with a Democratic mayor and city council in a state with a
  Democratic governor and legislature. Illinois governor JB Pritzker, who owns
  the Chicago Hyatt hotel, announced on Monday he would provide free rooms to
  the Texas Democrats for as long as they are out of state. A special session of
  the Texas legislature lasts for 30 days, but Abbott can renew the call for a
  special session at will. Under new rules the Texas house adopted in 2021, each
  lawmaker will be fined $500 a day for each day they abscond from the state.
  Democratic-led states have vowed to respond in kind if Texas moves ahead with
  its plans. Earlier on Monday, New York governor Kathy Hochul said that she was
  exploring “every option” to redraw state congressional lines. “I’m tired [of]
  fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back,” Hochul said at a news
  conference with six Texas Democrats who fled to her state. “We are at war,”
  she added. “And that’s why the gloves are off – and I say bring it on.”
