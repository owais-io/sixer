  The Prax Lindsey oil refinery collapsed after “material irregularities” were
  discovered in a complex £783m loan facility that funded the wider group, it
  has emerged. The refinery on the Humber estuary in northern England – one of
  just five left in the UK, – was suddenly plunged into administration in late
  June, prompting calls from furious government ministers for an investigation
  into Winston Soosaipillai, Prax Group’s oil tycoon owner. Amid uncertainty
  about the whereabouts of Soosaipillai, who goes by his middle names, Sanjeev
  Kumar, administrators sifting through the rubble of the refinery’s parent
  company, State Oil, published a progress report on Wednesday. Among details
  disclosed by Teneo, which is serving as the administrator for State Oil and
  five other group companies, is a £70m debt owed to HM Revenue and Customs by
  the group entity Prax Petroleum. Including sums owed by the refinery unit
  itself, which is being liquidated separately, taxpayers are thought to be owed
  up to £250m by the wider Prax Group. Alongside a list of hundreds of
  creditors, ranging from the oil company Shell to the ride-hailing app Uber and
  the pest control firm Rentokil, Teneo also offered new insight into the
  circumstances leading to the collapse of an oil empire that has been described
  by insiders as a “house of cards”. According to the Companies House filing,
  the failure hinged on unspecified “irregularities” relating to the £783m loan,
  arranged by HSBC in 2021 and secured against expected future income from the
  sale of oil products, such as petrol and jet fuel. This facility provided cash
  for “critical” payments as they came due, such as supplier invoices. State Oil
  was the guarantor of this securitisation facility, provided by an
  Ireland-based entity called Prax Global Financial Services (PGFS), which stood
  outside the Prax Group. PGFS itself borrowed from other international lenders.
  Teneo said the refinery, whose revenue generation was critical to the group,
  was already in a poor financial position in June 2025; the administrator
  blamed frequent maintenance shutdowns and poor refining margins since Prax
  bought the plant from the French oil company Total in 2021. The group was
  exploring ways to raise new funds when “material irregularities” were
  discovered and reported to State Oil’s board, it said. Teneo did not offer
  further details, such as who had identified the irregularities or what they
  were. Directors of the company, including Soosaipillai, decided that the £783m
  loan facility should “cease” with immediate effect. This meant that guarantees
  provided by State Oil to other parts of the group for debt financing were also
  called into question. The filings show that there are more than £1.5bn of
  inter-company loans outstanding between entities being administered by Teneo.
  The cessation of the loan facility meant that the refinery could no longer
  repay its major supplier, the global commodities trading company Glencore. In
  response, under the terms of its supply agreement with Prax, Glencore seized
  control of crude oil and refined products, which meant that sales to customers
  – such as at petrol stations and airports – could not take place without its
  approval. This, Teneo said, contributed to the “accelerated nature” of the
  company’s collapse, which blindsided government ministers, who said that just
  weeks earlier Soosaipillai has assured them of the company’s health. There was
  less than a week between the discovery of the irregularities and the
  appointment of administrators, the filings show. In its 112-page update, Teneo
  described as “uncertain” the amount that could be recovered for creditors and
  said it was not yet clear how much they would claim. It said there were “a
  number of outstanding matters that may significantly impact the final outcome
  for creditors”. It added that, while Companies House records showed that some
  creditors had outstanding loans to Prax companies, those companies’ own
  records indicated that no money was actually owed. Shell is owed more than
  £10m; HMRC is owed £70m; and Deloitte, which led a 2023 turnaround plan called
  Project King, is owed more than £700,000. As well as large corporate
  creditors, 171 employees of State Oil are owed a combined £4.2m, according to
  the filings. Of those, 45 have been made redundant. Teneo said it was trying
  to sell some of Prax Group’s assets, which include a North Sea oilfield, three
  tankers and hundreds of petrol stations. It placed the value of State Oil’s
  shareholdings in subsidiary companies at £112.2m. The administrator has also
  filed a legal claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Soosaipillai and said
  it would file a report into the businessman’s conduct, to be provided to the
  government’s insolvency service. Soosaipillai and his wife, Arani, who between
  them jointly owned the Prax Group, took £11.5m out of the business in pay and
  dividends after buying the refinery from Total, the Guardian reported this
  year. The energy minister, Michael Shanks, has since urged the couple to “do
  the decent thing” by paying support workers who have lost their jobs within
  State Oil, which employed 171 people, and in the wider group, which employed
  more than 600. Soosaipillai has not previously returned requests for comment
  directed to a former press representative. Government officials are understood
  to have had difficulty contacting Soosaipillai. Sources said he is believed to
  have left the country following the collapse of his oil empire. It was based
  in Weybridge, Surrey, and he and Arani built it up from a single petrol
  station over nearly three decades through rapid, debt-fuelled acquisitions.
  The Official Receiver, an independent government employee managing the
  liquidation of the refinery, said it could not find a buyer for the refinery,
  which has ceased production.
