  An Ohio affiliate of Planned Parenthood said it will not accept Medicaid
  insurance because of uncertainty around a judge’s ruling ordering the Trump
  administration to continue sending Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned
  Parenthood health centers. The operator of four clinics said it was concerned
  the administration could try to claw those payments back if the ruling is
  overturned. A second group of a dozen health centers is not offering
  long-acting contraceptive devices for Medicaid patients for similar reasons.
  The moves come after US district judge Indira Talwani blocked a provision of
  the sweeping tax bill that “defunds” abortion providers for one year if they
  received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in 2023. (The payments
  would be for non-abortion services like birth control and STI testing, as
  federal law already prohibits the program from covering abortions outside a
  few exceptions.) The order prevents the administration from enforcing the law
  against Planned Parenthood; an independent provider in Maine filed a separate
  suit and a hearing is scheduled for next week. The Trump administration filed
  notice on Tuesday that it would appeal the ruling to the first circuit court
  of appeals; the case will almost certainly make it to the US supreme court.
  Roughly a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics have announced closures since the
  bill was signed into law, with the latest including the organization’s only
  two health centers in Louisiana. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast said its New
  Orleans and Baton Rouge clinics would close on 30 September. Planned
  Parenthood Southwest Ohio (PPSWO), one of two affiliates in the state, said in
  a statement that, while it was “relieved” to see Talwani’s order, it would not
  resume accepting Medicaid, though it was seeing Medicaid patients who
  self-pay. “Unfortunately for many smaller affiliates, the risk of the federal
  government requesting back pay if the injunction expires is still too great,”
  a spokesperson said, citing legal filings in which the Trump justice
  department said it would seek to “claw back” payments if it ultimately wins
  the case. “We’re trying to mitigate that risk to preserve our capacity to
  offer the other critical services south-west Ohioans and hundreds of patients
  from the south come to us for,” a PPSWO spokesperson added, mentioning
  abortion and gender-affirming care. PPSWO closed two health centers at the end
  of July, leaving it with four clinics. The spokesperson said the judge’s
  injunction did not allow it to reopen the shuttered clinics in Springfield and
  Hamilton. “Across the country and even within a state we may see different
  strategic approaches to this devastating loss [for affiliates],” the affiliate
  said. “This course of action was ultimately the best option for us with
  long-term sustainability in mind.” The other Ohio affiliate, Planned
  Parenthood of Greater Ohio (PPGOH), said that, while it was accepting Medicaid
  at its 12 clinics after the injunction, it would not provide intrauterine
  devices or birth control implants to Medicaid patients – unless they self-pay
  for the devices and the insertion appointments. These forms of long-acting
  reversible contraception are some of the most effective, but they are costly
  and can be hard for low-income patients to access. Nearly all Planned
  Parenthood clinics offer same-day insertions of IUDs and implants, compared
  with 60 to 70% of other family-planning clinics and health departments, per
  the Guttmacher Institute. In a statement to the Guardian, PPGOH said it would
  not offer IUDs or Nexplanon implants to patients with Medicaid over fears that
  the Trump administration will demand that money be repaid if it ultimately
  wins in court. “These are the most expensive services we provide and to
  protect the organization from the risk of extreme financial loss, we can’t
  risk providing these services now and then never having the claims paid,” a
  PPGOH spokesperson said. Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the
  umbrella organization that oversees a network of nearly 50 independent
  regional affiliates, which run roughly 600 clinics across the US. The budget
  bill defines abortion clinics as “prohibited entities” for Medicaid if they
  hit the aforementioned reimbursement threshold and perform abortions as of 1
  October. During negotiations for the bill, when the “defund” period was 10
  years, PPFA’s accreditation board informed affiliates about new waivers to
  seek approval to cease providing abortions; doing so may allow them to remain
  in Medicaid. It’s not known if any affiliates have submitted such waivers
  after the one-year provision was signed into law, but some are changing their
  billing practices, such as in Ohio. Other affiliates, meanwhile, have said
  they are back to processing Medicaid insurance claims as they typically would
  following the preliminary injunction. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s chief
  strategy officer, Michelle Velasquez, told NPR that the judge’s 28 July ruling
  “means that there is no doubt about whether or not we can provide that care”
  to patients with Medicaid. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains and
  Planned Parenthood of Maryland confirmed to the Guardian that they had resumed
  billing the health insurance program. Some are proceeding with caution. As of
  Thursday, Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in
  California had a notice on its website saying that Planned Parenthood “has
  been blocked” from receiving Medicaid funds. When contacted for comment, a
  spokesperson said: “PPOSBC is in the process of carefully resuming its billing
  for California Medi-Cal services it has provided since the defunding provision
  was passed, tracking all legal and regulatory updates from the court and the
  state, and modifying its approach as changes occur to ensure ongoing
  compliance with currently applicable law.”
