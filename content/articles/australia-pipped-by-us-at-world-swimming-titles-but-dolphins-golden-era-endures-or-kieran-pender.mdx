  Australia’s golden generation in the pool is going nowhere. That much, at
  least, was clear in Singapore over the past week, as the Dolphins ended the
  2025 world championships on eight gold medals, just one shy of perennial
  rivals the United States. With some swimmers only recently back in the water
  following a post-Olympics break – Ariarne Titmus participated from the
  commentary box rather than the pool – and a bout of food poisoning derailing
  some athletes, it was an impressive outing from the Dolphins. Two swimmers
  were at the forefront, responsible in whole or in part for five of Australia’s
  eight gold medals – Mollie O’Callaghan and Kaylee McKeown. O’Callaghan, still
  only 21, went level with Australian swimming great Ian Thorpe on 11 world
  titles, thanks to two relay golds (the women’s 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle),
  and an individual title in the 200m freestyle, plus two silver medals. After
  winning two Olympic gold medals as a relay heat swimmer in Tokyo, O’Callaghan
  had dominant showings at the 2022 and 2023 world titles, before winning three
  golds in Paris. With five Olympic gold medals to her name, O’Callaghan is
  already level with Thorpe and McKeown, and only one behind Emma McKeon,
  Australia’s most successful Olympian ever. With several more world
  championships ahead, and her eyes set on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 and
  possibly even a home Olympics in Brisbane in seven years’ time, O’Callaghan is
  almost certain to become Australia’s most successful swimmer of all time.
  McKeown, meanwhile, won both the women’s 100m and 200m backstroke after seeing
  off long-time American rival Regan Smith. The Queenslander won both events in
  Tokyo, Paris and at the 2023 world titles. McKeown has been the undisputed
  backstroke queen for half a decade now; she is arguably the best backstroke
  swimmer of all time. And she might have even won more gold in Singapore, had
  McKeown not been a late withdrawal from the 50m backstroke. With 10 individual
  gold medals across Olympic Games and world titles, McKeown is now the most
  successful Australian swimmer in individual events – ahead of Thorpe and Grant
  Hackett on nine apiece. Titmus and O’Callaghan each have five. All of those
  victories have been battles to the end – in part, what makes McKeown’s success
  so remarkable is that it has come against such close competition, and yet the
  Australian has so consistently come out on top. As InsightLane pointed out on
  X, the aggregate margin of victory across those 10 gold medals is just 4.41
  seconds – or less time than it took to read this sentence. Time and again, in
  those clutch moments, McKeown has had the edge. O’Callaghan and McKeown were
  not the only Australians to shine in Singapore, whether individually or
  collectively. The Dolphins’ relay depth was apparent, as they won three golds,
  one silver and one bronze medal across the disciplines. However, a failure to
  qualify for the final of the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay – having won gold in
  both the men’s and women’s – was unfortunate, while the Australian men did not
  progress through the heats of their medley relay. Australia’s dominance in
  freestyle sprint events was also underscored – team veteran Cameron McEvoy won
  the men’s 50m freestyle, to add to his Paris Olympics crown, while on Sunday
  night Meg Harris won the women’s edition. O’Callaghan won silver in the 100m
  freestyle, narrowly out-touched by Dutchwoman Marrit Steenbergen, while sprint
  supremo Kyle Chalmers won bronze in the men’s two-lap freestyle. There were
  also several breakthrough performances. Lani Pallister surged to silver in the
  women’s 800m freestyle, almost upsetting American legend Katie Ledecky and
  beating Canada’s Summer McIntosh to second; the 23-year-old Australian also
  won bronze in the women’s 1500m. Harrison Turner won bronze – “dirty gold,” in
  his words – to claim Australia’s first world championships medal in the men’s
  200m butterfly, while Jenna Forrester had a return to form to win silver in
  the women’s 400m individual medley. Alex Perkins was on the podium in both the
  women’s 50m and 100m butterfly, while Lizzy Dekkers won bronze in the 200m
  edition. Even the bad news – a bout of apparent food poisoning, which had
  first taken down several American swimmers and then reached the Australian
  camp – had a silver lining. Sam Short was 0.02 seconds off a gold medal in the
  men’s 400m freestyle on the opening night of the meet, before looking in
  ominous form in the 800m heats. The law student was then forced out of the
  final with illness, but recovered to swim a gutsy fourth in the 1500m on the
  final night. The Queenslander had made lunch plans with his parents – so
  convinced he wouldn’t qualify for the 1500m finals after his illness – but had
  to cancel following a late surge. It is the second unfortunate major meet in a
  row for Short, who had a disappointing showing in Paris, but the 21-year-old
  has time on his side. Three years remain until the 2028 Olympics, and much can
  happen in that space of time. Success at these world titles is no guarantee of
  future glory. But after a year to decompress and regroup following the highs
  of Paris, the Singapore meet offered much promise for the Dolphins. “There are
  a lot of great takeaways,” head coach Rohan Taylor said on Sunday. This truly
  is a golden generation for Australian swimming.
