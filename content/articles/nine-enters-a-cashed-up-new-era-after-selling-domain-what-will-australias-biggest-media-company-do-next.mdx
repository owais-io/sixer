  Nine Entertainment is entering a new chapter without its online real estate
  platform Domain, an asset once seen as crucial to the survival of a
  traditional media business battered by the digital age. But it will have an
  anticipated $150m pile of cash from the sale of the portal to US property
  conglomerate CoStar after it pays shareholders a special dividend, raising
  expectations it will hunt for acquisitions. What will Australia’s biggest
  media company do next? Still the one? Nine, which merged with Fairfax Media in
  2018, boasts a broad set of assets stretching across its flagship television
  network, radio stations 2GB, 3AW, 4BC and 6PR, streaming service Stan and
  mastheads the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial
  Review. Its pre-eminent challenge, according to Omkar Joshi, the chief
  investment officer at Sydney-headquartered Opal Capital Management, is
  addressing the profitability of its television network, given it is Nine’s
  biggest revenue earner. “The problem with that is the free-to-air TV market
  has been under pressure for a number of years, and that is in a structural
  decline,” Joshi says. “We’ve already seen a fair bit of that decline come
  through, but structural decline stories do take time.” The trouble with
  sectors in structural decline is that signs of a turnaround often prove
  fleeting. Nine’s broadcast advertising revenue picked up earlier this year,
  but soon fell away. The temporary bump was driven by election spending,
  according to analysts at E&amp;P. Nine earned $604m in advertising revenue
  from its broadcast business unit in the last six months of 2024, a division
  that takes in television, including 9Now, and radio. That was up slightly from
  2023, but below the advertising dollars generated during the same period in
  2021 and 2022. Younger viewers, in particular, are viewing content on online
  platforms, and television networks haven’t captured them in sufficient numbers
  on their own free-to-air digital services. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Joshi says Nine may look to buy an “out-of-home” advertising company, given
  the growth in demand for digital billboards commonly seen on buildings and bus
  shelters. “Outdoor media could be something that they take seriously and look
  to buy in that space with oOh!media one of the potential names of interest,”
  Joshi says. “That wouldn’t be a bad counterbalance to some of the issues
  you’re seeing in free-to-air TV because outdoor media advertising is
  definitely growing. “One of the challenges they face is they don’t want to end
  up like Seven West, where they’ve only got, effectively, TV and publishing
  assets. The market just doesn’t want that.” Talkback radio Nine’s suite of AM
  stations is another asset facing headwinds, given it is a medium largely
  consumed by older generations. It is also being challenged by podcasts and
  streaming services. One fund manager invested in media assets, who asked not
  to be identified, says he hopes Nine doesn’t buy more radio stations. “Media
  acquisitions don’t have a particularly good track record; you tend to find
  that they always overpay and nothing they expect ever materialises. “Our view
  is that consolidation can work, particularly in businesses that are in
  decline. “But the problem is that for them to work, the cost cutting has to be
  pretty savage, and most organisations are just not good at doing that.” The
  fund manager says Nine is more likely to be a seller of its radio network than
  a buyer of other stations. While Nine’s broadcast assets have been under
  pressure, its streaming platform Stan methodically increases revenue year
  after year. Stan’s recent purchase of broadcast rights to the Premier League,
  the most watched football competition in the world, shows how invested Nine is
  in growing the platform, which is seen as critical to the company’s future.
  However, generating healthy profits from paid streaming services is not
  without its challenges, given platforms must continually invest heavily in new
  content, and promote their platforms to consumers, to attract and keep fickle
  subscribers. Digital rags After surviving some bleak years for the newspaper
  industry, Nine’s mastheads found a way forward with their subscription model.
  Shortly before the pandemic, advertising revenue for Nine’s stable of
  newspapers was by far the division’s biggest source of revenue, while it still
  enjoyed a reasonable level of income from circulation fees. While those two
  income sources have broadly fallen, subscription revenue has helped replace
  them. In the last six-month reporting period, subscription income overtook
  advertising as the division’s primary revenue source. The print and digital
  titles are starting to be looked at by the investment community as the most
  valuable part of Nine, a view that would have been risible just a few years
  ago. Analysts at Jarden expect Nine will have $150m in net cash left over from
  selling its majority stake in Domain, after paying out a special dividend with
  some of the proceeds. Domain shareholders approved the sale on 4 August,
  paving the way for the transaction to be finalised by the end of the month.
  While Domain persistently underperformed rival REA Group, operator of
  realestate.com.au, it still represented a significant part of Nine, and tapped
  into Australia’s robust property market. Nine indicated in a May update that
  after the sale it would be open to “disciplined strategic investment
  opportunities, both organic and inorganic”. Morningstar’s director of equity
  research, Brian Han, says Nine should consider not buying anything. “It makes
  me nervous when companies say things like, ‘we’re going to pursue disciplined,
  strategic investment opportunities’. That is consultant speak for, ‘I want to
  buy something’,” Han says. “I’m just scared that they’ll justify it on some
  spurious cross-media synergy strategy.” He says Nine should build on its
  sports and content library for Stan, while also focusing on digitising the
  metropolitan mastheads. “If they keep on doing that, and the numbers start
  coming through in terms of growth … later on you can come back to the market
  and ask shareholders for money to buy something.” • Jonathan Barrett is
