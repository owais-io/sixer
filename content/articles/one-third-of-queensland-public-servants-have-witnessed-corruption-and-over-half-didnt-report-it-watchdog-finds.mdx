  A third of Queensland public servants say they have witnessed corruption in
  their workplace in the last five years, according to a survey by the state’s
  anti-corruption watchdog. However, the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission
  (CCC) investigated fewer than 1% of complaints referred to it, and has only
  charged a single person with a corruption offence in a year, it revealed in
  parliament this week. The survey, which included 5,957 state government public
  servants, 928 employees of local councils and 114 employees of the police
  service, was conducted between March and May. About 55% of public sector
  employees reported they had either witnessed or potentially witnessed
  corruption in the past five years. Of 31% who believed they had witnessed
  corruption, “55% did not report it”, the survey found. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The primary reasons those who said they would not report corruption
  gave were: fear of retribution, reprisals and concerns about confidentiality,
  safety, and privacy. “I don’t have faith that the complaint would be
  investigated confidentially, fairly or thoroughly,” one anonymous survey
  respondent said. The report quotes another saying: “Because I will be
  identified to the parties that you are complaining about and the repercussions
  are I will lose my job. Seen it time and time again.” According to documents
  tabled in parliament this week, the CCC assessed 5,567 corruption matters in
  the 2024-25 financial year and retained 33. Of the matters, 3,700 were
  referred back to the “unit of public administration” they were made about, and
  1,834 were dropped. One person was charged with one corruption offence during
  that period, it reported. The continued practice of referring complaints back
  to the departments they were made against comes years after a landmark inquiry
  recommended it be ended entirely for police. The landmark November 2022 Call
  for Change inquiry into the Queensland police’s response to domestic and
  family violence heard evidence of repeated failure by the integrity oversight
  system. It recommended creating a police integrity unit within the CCC “within
  18 months”. The body would be responsible for investigating all complaints
  about the police. The deadline was missed last year, under Labor. In July 2024
  the CCC chair, Bruce Barbour, told parliament there had not been any progress
  on the “urgent” recommendation “in any meaningful way”. The new LNP government
  has not committed to implementing the reform and has repeatedly refused to
  answer questions about progress. Of public servants surveyed by the CCC, 41%
  reported they had not witnessed corruption in the past five years. Others
  weren’t sure if witnessed behaviour constituted corruption. Of public sector
  employees, 90% agreed corruption happened in Queensland, with 65% agreeing
  that it was a problem in Queensland. “Only two in five employees (40%) agree
  they would feel comfortable if their complaint was investigated by their
  workplace,” the CCC report stated. The survey was tabled in Queensland
  parliament in July.
