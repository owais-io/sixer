  I look after my grandchildren – at least a few hours for one day a week, often
  more (‘There’s an overwhelming bond of love’: the grandparents whose kids rely
  on them to raise a family, 29 July). I love them deeply, and want to offer
  them whatever steadiness I can, while I can. But love alone isn’t what holds
  this together. I also care for them because their parents, like so many
  others, are stretched to the edge. Childcare is unaffordable. Work is
  relentless. There’s little left in reserve. Many grandparents step in not as a
  choice, but as the only available buffer in a fraying system. But that help
  comes at a cost. Caring for young children is tiring at any age; for older
  adults, after a full day or more, the next day is often a write-off too, which
  seems to be something almost no policy takes into account. This reflects the
  gradual withdrawal of social responsibility from care, and the assumption that
  families will absorb the shock. We’re seeing the effects of this every day
  through exhaustion, silence and strain carried behind closed doors. As a
  systemic psychotherapist, I try to pay attention to patterns; what holds
  people together, and what pulls them apart. One pattern I see is that the work
  of care has become more vital, yet less visible. Grandparents, like many
  others, are holding families together behind the scenes. But we rarely speak
  about it, and policy almost never accounts for it. In this era of rapidly
  evolving climate disruption and growing social fragility, care is the
  connective tissue that keeps communities alive. If we fail to recognise and
  support it, we weaken the very systems we’ll need to face what’s coming. Dr
  Hugh Palmer Pocklington, East Yorkshire • I read your article with great
  interest as the grandparent of four children, but was sad that you did not
  take the opportunity to comment on the benefits and burdens for those of us
  who care full-time for our grandchildren. Over half of the estimated 140,000
  children in kinship care are with grandparents full-time, and we are most
  definitely “taking on a level of grandparenting that looks a lot more like
  parenting”. We do miss out on “just being Granny” as we perform the parenting
  role with the grandchildren in our care. One of the losses I feel as we parent
  our 12-year‑old grandson towards adulthood is that he misses out on
  grandparents and we miss out on grandparenting. Unlike part-time grandparent
  carers, we don’t have less anxiety as we deal with loss of work and income,
  lack of support, and difficult relationships with biological parents. And our
  chances of pursuing our own retirement plans are not limited – they’re gone.
  We also struggle with the cost, the sense of obligation and the feeling of
  having no choice, but to a much greater extent. And we most certainly “plug
  the gaps of a system not fit for purpose”. In our case, this is the children’s
  social care system. The alternative forms of care for our grandchildren
  continue to have persistent deficits that lead to very poor life chances.
  There are so many benefits to us in terms of the loving relationships we have
  with our grandchildren, but the deficits are often serious and damaging to our
  mental health and, sometimes, the stability of our kinship families. Name and
  address supplied • When I read about grandparents caring for and loving their
  grandchildren I feel such utter sadness and envy. Not because my children
  don’t have grandparents but because their grandparents aren’t interested in
  being around them. It’s a certain kind of heartache, not to mention the
  practical side of living with the exhaustion of not having help and having a
  disabled child. I know they are busy, they have their lives to live, and I
  understand their desire to protect that. But I will never understand their
  indifference to their grandchildren and our situation. Everyone who has
  parents who are involved in their grandchildren’s lives are the luckiest
  people – I hope they know that. Name and address supplied • Surely
  grandparents being heavily involved in child raising is only new for the
  middle classes? Nans at the school gate was absolutely the norm when I was
  growing up in the 80s, and as a mother of 10, my mother’s Mam always had a
  houseful of grandkids. Tracey Houghton Newport • Have an opinion on anything
