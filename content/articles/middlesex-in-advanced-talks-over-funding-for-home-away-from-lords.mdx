  Middlesex are in advanced negotiations with two international investment
  groups over a funding deal that would enable the club to build a permanent
  home away from Lord’s. A source involved in the discussions said the proposals
  are not mutually exclusive, with a final decision to be made by the end of the
  year. Uxbridge Cricket Club in west London is understood to be the preferred
  site for a new ground and training base, although Middlesex would aim to stage
  around 70% of their men’s matches at Lord’s. Middlesex have been looking for
  external investment for about 18 months and in February appointed the gaming
  and sports investment specialists Oakvale Capital to conduct a review of its
  ownership. After that review Middlesex are understood to have resolved to seek
  a financial partnership that would enable them to build a new ground in London
  to accompany their Lord’s tenancy, rather than sell a stake in the club and
  take it into private ownership, a move that could have been blocked by their
  members. Middlesex have received expressions of interest from a variety of
  global groups who are already invested in sport, including the NFL and the
  Indian Premier League. The club have prioritised investors with a history in
  sport rather than private equity firms, with a number of funds from America
  having been rebuffed. Middlesex are also in active discussions with Marylebone
  Cricket Club to extend their 12-month lease at Lord’s, which expires at the
  end of the summer. While this is regarded as a formality, the financial terms
  have yet to be agreed. MCC remains committed to a landlord-tenant relationship
  with Middlesex that has run without interruption since 1877 but, with the
  volume of domestic cricket increasing, the availability of Lord’s is a
  problem. In addition to the rapid recent growth of women’s cricket, with
  Lord’s staging a women’s Test for the first time next summer, between England
  and India, from next year MCC will also be running professional teams for the
  first time in its 238-year history in the form of London Spirit. MCC’s
  partners in the Hundred, the so-called Tech Titans, have made it clear that
  they will want more access to Lord’s in return for their £151m investment,
  while the competition could also expand from its eight-team format, which
  would mean more matches. The England and Wales Cricket Board is also looking
  into staging women’s matches as standalone events, which would put further
  demands on venues such as Lord’s. Middlesex have used Radlett and Merchant
  Taylors’ school for County Championship, T20 Blast and One-Day Cup fixtures
  this season. Last year, they played two “home” Blast games at Chelmsford in
  Essex last year, which made financial sense, but angered members. The club
  regularly used Uxbridge for Championship and one-day matches in the 1980s and
  1990s, but have not played there since 2017 as the ground needs to be
  developed. In a separate development, Middlesex have begun work on a new venue
  for their women’s and girl’s operation in Brentford, which will open next year
  and will be used as a training base for national teams competing in the
  women’s T20 World Cup. Middlesex Women are in tier two of the new county
  set-up launched this year by the ECB, but hope to be promoted to an expanded
  tier one in 2029. Middlesex declined to comment.
