  Your new film The Baltimorons, about an improv comic who teams up with a
  divorcee dentist, has a very “yes and” energy. What’s been your wildest “yes
  and” moment? My most memorable “yes and” moment is when I went home to New
  Orleans, where my friends who I grew up with were spending their weekends
  breaking into the local zoo and swimming in the tank with the sea lions. Not
  the seals – the sea lions. We had been out, it was one in the morning, there
  were many alcoholic beverages involved, and it involved waiting for the
  security guards to be looking the wrong way, finding the sea lion exhibit,
  climbing fences and diving in. Apparently when I jumped in, a sea lion had
  just swam right under me as I was hitting the water. I had no clue. The
  Baltimorons is a Christmas romcom. What’s your favourite Christmas movie? I
  have not seen Bad Santa in a very long time, and my instincts are that it’s
  not OK to love Bad Santa any more, and that it might actually not be a great
  movie. But I saw Bad Santa at Christmas when it released theatrically, and it
  was the most explosive, irreverent, exciting antidote to Christmas. Because we
  would often go to movies on Christmas Day, and you’re just so done with
  Christmas. And this was just destroying Christmas, frame by frame by frame. I
  loved it at the time – I’ve washed my hands of it now. I don’t want to get
  cancelled because I liked a movie 20 years ago. You and your brother wrote a
  book about film-making. What’s the one most important thing you know now that
  you wish you knew when you were starting out? We have a philosophy: make
  movies, not meetings. It’s very easy to confuse talking about movies with
  making movies. And, you know, there’s just so much hemming and hawing and so
  much thinking and perfectionism. Nothing’s ever going to be perfect. You’re
  never going to line everything up just right. If you want to make a movie, you
  need to make a movie. If you don’t, you’re not making movies. It’s that
  simple. What’s the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened on set? Luckily, I
  haven’t had anybody get injured on a set – no big real-life stuff. But the
  scariest thing that I’ve done – and I’ve done it on tiny movies, I’ve done it
  on big movies – is [say], “Hey everybody, we don’t know what we’re doing right
  now. Hello, A-list, Oscar-winning actor. I fucked this up, and I don’t know
  what this is. And what I need to do is take a walk around the block for 20
  minutes and figure out what this scene really needs, because what we’re doing
  right now isn’t going to cut it.” People don’t like that. They want you to
  always have all the answers and know everything. What film do you always
  return to, and why? The original Rocky. It’s the best underdog story. It’s got
  great plotting, the love story is wonderful, it’s moving and so subversive.
  When I tell people that Rocky is my favourite movie of all time, they’re like,
  “Oh, God, how can you watch that?” And my reply is always, “Well, who do you
  think wins?” They’re like, “Obviously Rocky.” And I’m like, “Well, now you
  need to re-see Rocky. You clearly have not seen that movie, really.” I’ve seen
  that film probably 20 times. What are you secretly really good at? I’m
  secretly really good at doing 14 hours of work inside of a freelance day.
  That’s probably my biggest superpower. I can teach you how to do it: it’s
  called the high school schedule. It’s like when you went to high school and
  you woke up at 7am, got to school at 8am and did seven subjects from 8am to
  3pm and then you went and did a sport afterwards, and then you went home and
  did three hours of homework. I mean, that’s what I did – I went to a Catholic
  prep school, and that’s how I built my schedule. All of us freelance artists,
  we are just swimming around in all this time and all this freedom. I don’t
  have any any more, because I got kids, dogs, a mortgage, a company to run and
  a bunch of movies and TV shows, but that’s how I do it. At a certain point, I
  was floundering and just trying to organise myself – I think that’s probably
  the biggest challenge of every independent artist – and I came up with this
  idea of a high school schedule, and I just started scheduling every hour.
  You’re on my high school schedule today: 4pm, do this interview. I was just
  working on a script right before then, and then my alarm went off. I set
  alarms. I think it’s my best skill. It’s the same as “make movies” – there is
  no replacement for just doing tremendous amounts of undeniable work. You
  studied psychology and were planning to make a career out of it. Care to share
  any psychological advice? The best single thing that I learned in therapy is:
  “I’m going to be OK, no matter what.” I’ve dealt with some very challenging
  things over the course of a 52-year life and once I got on board with this
  idea that I’m going to be OK no matter what, it’s a bit of a self-fulfilling
  prophecy. Every day I wake up with anxiety and when I can come back to that
  place – “I’m going to be OK, no matter what” – and really believe it and know
  it to be true, it really does change everything. You bring a sense of calm and
  forward momentum into everything that you’re doing, no matter what the
  circumstances are. You started acting later in your career in shows like
  Transparent; what’s the best lesson you learned from working with other
  actors? I heard an actor one time ask a director: “What is the event of this
  scene?” It was a gentle way of saying: nothing’s fucking happening in this
  scene, and there’s nothing to play. A common problem with independent films is
  that there’s not enough story; a common problem with studio films is that the
  story is trite or arch or overdone. What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in
  with a celebrity? I was drunk at a party, and I pitched a movie to Wanda Sykes
  on the spot, which is that I would like to make a movie about the second
  coming of Jesus, and Wanda Sykes is Jesus. She was like, “You’re fucking
  crazy, dude.” She didn’t say anything, but her eyes were like Mm-hmm. I think
  it was just because I was coming in hot. But I didn’t make it up in the moment
  – I had been thinking about it: the second coming of Jesus, and Jesus is a
  black lesbian. If you’re listening, Wanda: I’m sorry – and my offer still
  stands. If you were an animal, what animal would you be and why? A dolphin.
  That was an unexpectedly quick answer. I don’t really know why, but I’ve been
  obsessed with dolphins since I was in kindergarten. I wrote several book
  reports on them. I just love them. They are loving and kind and creative and
  social and playful and, for the most part, very peace-loving, magical beings.
  People should be more like dolphins. I fully agree, except for the unwanted
  sexual harassment, which apparently they are prone to, which people have
  informed me of. I’m like, let me live my dreams. The Baltimorons screens on 14
  August and 17 August as part of Melbourne international film festival
