  “Christians, get out and vote, just this time,” Donald Trump exhorted the
  audience at a campaign event organized by the conservative Turning Point
  Action in July 2024. “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have
  it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.” Since his defeat by Joe
  Biden in 2020, Trump has been building toward delivery on that promise, first
  by fomenting suspicion of widespread election fraud, then by trying to
  overturn the results via legal challenge and intimidation, and finally, on 6
  January 2021, by force. Now the White House and Republicans both in Washington
  and the states are colluding more brazenly than ever to “fix it” – “it”
  meaning free and fair elections they might lose. Republicans’ aim is permanent
  control of the US government. Trump’s is the crown. As their assaults on
  voting rights – and the institution of elections itself – escalate, their
  success begins to look, if not inevitable, alarmingly possible. Trump’s
  tactics are working. The 2020 election was the cleanest and most efficient in
  memory. Claims of rampant fraud are lies – the big lie, as the 2021 House
  impeachment committee put it. But not among Republican voters. A Pew survey
  taken before the 2024 election found that Trump supporters were “deeply
  skeptical about the way the election will be conducted”, especially compared
  with Harris supporters. Whereas over 85% of Democratic voters believed in 2024
  that absentee ballots would be counted accurately, and ineligible voters
  prevented from voting, among Trump supporters only 38% and 30%, respectively,
  felt the same. Buoyed by the big lie – and liberated by the supreme court’s
  2013 gutting of the Voting Rights Act – voter suppression attempts reached a
  peak after the 2020 elections, when legislators introduced more than 400
  restrictive bills. Signing Georgia’s 98-page Election Integrity Act in 2021,
  Brian Kemp, the Republican governor, was unambiguous about its partisan aim.
  “After the November election last year” –when record turnout in the reliably
  red state yielded victories for Biden and two Democratic US senators, and the
  secretary of state resisted Trump’s shakedown to “find 11,780 votes” to
  reverse the outcome – “I knew, like so many of you, that significant reforms
  to our state elections were needed,” he said. By September 2024, 31 states had
  enacted 114 such laws. In May 2024, Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
  that he would accept the results of the election only if “everything’s honest”
  – that is, if he won. This definition of honesty took hold. According to some
  polls, before election day, fewer than a quarter of Trump supporters believed
  the election would be fair. After it, their confidence rates more than
  doubled. And while Republican concerns about fraud were pervasive in 2020,
  they were – surprise, surprise – virtually nonexistent when the 2024 results
  came in. With their man in the White House, congressional Republicans set
  about preparing for his coronation. Three days into Trump’s term, the
  Tennessee representative Andy Ogles introduced a bill to amend the
  constitution to allow presidents to serve three terms. At Trumpstore.com, you
  can buy a red “Trump 2028” cap for $50. On 25 March Trump issued the executive
  order “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” which
  melds his xenophobic paranoia-mongering with his desire to “fix” elections.
  Its mandates range from requiring proof of citizenship to vote (an answer to
  the spectral threat of undocumented people stuffing the ballot boxes) to a ban
  on the bar codes that expedite vote counting. The executive order itself is
  illegal. The constitution gives the states, not the president, the power to
  regulate elections. On 4 April, the House passed the Safeguard American Voter
  Eligibility (Save) Act, requiring registrants and voters to document
  citizenship. The GOP’s election-interference campaign is accelerating. On 7
  July, the justice department’s civil rights division wrote a letter to Greg
  Abbott, the Texas governor, and Ken Paxton, the state attorney general,
  alleging that four of its majority-minority “coalition districts” are illegal
  under the Voting Rights Act and directing the state to redraw its electoral
  map. Voting rights experts dispute this interpretation. In fact, the law
  prohibits the dilution of the electoral power of voters of color either by
  packing them into one district or spreading them out by gerrymandering–which
  is what the new map would do. In mid-July, the justice department issued broad
  requests to state election officials to turn over their election data and
  voter rolls. In Colorado, where Biden won by 11 points in 2020, a guy called
  Jeff Small – chief of staff to the Colorado Republican representative and Save
  Act cheerleader Lauren Boebert – began contacting officials claiming he was
  working with the Trump administration on election “integrity” and asking if
  they would kindly let the feds, or somebody, inspect their voting machines,
  according to Washington Post reporting. After one such request, the Department
  of Homeland Security called to follow up. Officials of both parties were
  outraged, especially when it came to monkeying with the equipment, an illegal
  act. “Anybody who is asking for access to the voting machines outside of the
  law” is suspicious, the Republican executive director of the Colorado County
  Clerks Association told the Washington Post. “That automatically raises red
  flags in terms of their intent.” Colorado’s Democratic secretary of state made
  the larger point: “This all is part of a bigger ploy to further undermine our
  voting in this country,” she said. “They are actively in a power grab.”
  Meanwhile, the White House was leaning on Texas’s governor and legislative
  leaders to redraw their electoral map according to Trump’s specifications,
  dismantling Democratic strongholds to create five more Republican House seats
  – to which the president averred his party is “entitled”. When Texas got on
  board, on 3 August the state’s 51 Democrats left the state, risking fines and
  arrest, to thwart the effort. To cover all bases, on 7 August, Trump ordered
  the commerce department to prepare a new US census leaving out undocumented
  immigrants. Under the constitution, the census counts the number of “persons,”
  not citizens; it must be conducted “within every … ten years”, and states must
  redistrict to concur with new data. In a post on Truth Social, the president
  described a bespoke tally “using the results and information gained from the
  Presidential Election of 2024”. The same day, the vice-president, JD Vance,
  descended on bright-red Indiana with a trio of Trump appointees to strong-arm
  its leaders to redistrict as well. Afterward, on X, Indiana’s lieutenant
  governor, Micah Beckwith, genuflected to Vance: “Your bold leadership and
  unwavering support for President Trump’s mission to expand the conservative
  majority in Congress is exactly what America needs right now.” On Fox News,
  the vice-president echoed Trump’s contention that counting undocumented
  immigrants in the census unfairly gives the advantage to Democrats, whom he
  also charged with “aggressive” gerrymandering. “We’re just trying to rebalance
  the scales,” Vance said. After two weeks, Democrats returned to the Texas
  state house. Republican leaders forced them to sign “permission slips” to
  leave the chamber and assigned police escorts to monitor them. After refusing
  to sign, one Democrat spent nights in the chamber. While speaking on the phone
  with Gavin Newsom, the California governor, from the bathroom, she was
  informed the call constituted a felony, she said. On Saturday, the Texas
  senate approved legislation creating the new map, which Abbott says he will
  sign “swiftly”. The move had already set off an avalanche of mid-decade
  redistricting, led by California. Other states, controlled by both parties,
  may follow. Last week on Truth Social, Trump announced he would “lead a
  movement” to eliminate mail-in ballots – an idea he apparently picked up from
  Vladimir Putin – and also “inaccurate” voting machines. He said he would sign
  an executive order to this effect soon. “Remember, the States are merely an
  ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,”
  Trump fantasized. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by
  the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY,
  to do.” Maybe the following order will eliminate voting altogether – for the
  good of our country, of course. Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist,
