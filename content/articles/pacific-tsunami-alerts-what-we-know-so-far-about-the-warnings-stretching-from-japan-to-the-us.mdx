  An 8.8-magnitude earthquake that hit off Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula early on
  Wednesday has caused tsunami waves in Russia, Japan and Alaska and prompted
  warnings for Hawaii, North and Central America and Pacific islands south
  toward New Zealand.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said waves of 1 to 3
  metres above tide level were possible along some coastal areas of Hawaii,
  Chile, Japan, Solomon Islands, Russia and Ecuador. The earthquake was the
  strongest in the region since 1952, according to the Russian Academy of
  Sciences, and struck at a depth of 19.3km (12 miles). It was centred 126km (80
  miles) east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city along Russia’s
  Avacha Bay. Early reports of damage have come from Russia, with Kamchatka’s
  governor describing the quake in a post on Telegram as “serious and the
  strongest in decades of tremors”. A kindergarten in the area had been damaged,
  he said. A tsunami wave swept away buildings on the coastal area of
  Severo-Kurilsk, the main settlement on Russia’s Kuril Islands in the Pacific,
  according to local officials. The regional authorities declared a state of
  emergency but mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said all residents were safe and had
  been evacuated. The country’s emergency ministry said parts of the town had
  been flooded. Japan issued evacuation warnings and officials said three
  tsunami waves had been recorded, the largest of which was 60cm. Officials said
  waves up to 3 metres could arrive along the northern Japanese coast. Workers
  at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant in northeast Japan were evacuated,
  with plant operator Tepco saying that “no abnormality” had been observed at
  the site. The Fukushima Daiichi plant went into meltdown after being hit by a
  tsunami in 2011. In the US, tsunami warning sirens blared in Honolulu and
  people were told to move to higher ground. The National Tsunami Warning
  Center, based in Alaska, issued a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska
  Aleutian Islands, and a watch for portions of the West Coast, including
  California, Oregon, and Washington, and Hawaii. Donald Trump posted on Truth
  Social urging Americans to “stay strong and stay safe” after the tsunami
  warnings New Zealand’s disaster management agency warned that the country’s
  coastal areas could expect “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable
  surges at the shore”. In a national advisory alert, Civil Defence New Zealand
  said there was no immediate need to evacuate but said citizens should stay
  away from beaches and shore areas A warning was issued that tsunami waves of
  less than 0.5 metres could hit some parts of Indonesia. The tsunami could
  reach some coastal cities and towns in the Papua region, North Maluku province
  and Gorontalo province, a local agency said in a statement. Peru also issued a
  tsunami alert. The president of the country’s Geophysical Institute, Hernando
  Tavera, told AFP the tsunami “generated by this earthquake is expected to
  reach the Peruvian coast on Wednesday morning, with waves not expected to
  exceed three meters in height.” Mexico said it was mobilising authorities at
  all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches. The
  Mexican Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from
  Baja California in the north-west to Chiapas in the south of Mexico.
