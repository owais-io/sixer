  In recent weeks, hundreds of people have been arrested for taking part in
  demonstrations organised by the campaign group Defend Our Juries. Their
  alleged crime is expressing support for Palestine Action, which has been
  proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Yvette Cooper, the home secretary.
  One striking detail among those detained is their age. Half of those arrested
  at the largest protest yet, in Parliament Square in London on Saturday, were
  60 or older. Some said they had taken part to give a voice to younger people
  who have more to lose by breaking the law, some simply felt they must
  challenge the government’s stance. The Guardian has spoken to some of these
  protesters. * * * ‘This is not a terrorist organisation, it’s a direct action
  organisation’ Deborah Hinton, 81 “The government is looking [like] such
  idiots,” said Deborah Hinton, a former magistrate. “I mean when people say,
  ‘What’s your status?’, and then I say, ‘Well, I’m on bail for terrorism’, they
  look at me as if the situation is farcical. I think they [ministers] are
  making themselves look an absolute joke.” Hinton was arrested at a 19 July
  demonstration in Cornwall arranged by Defend Our Juries (DOJ). A former member
  of the Parole Board, she was awarded an OBE in 1994 for services to the
  community. She said she was already involved with DOJ because she was worried
  about the erosion of free speech and the right to protest, but the banning of
  Palestine Action was a “red line”. She said: “In my view, Palestine Action is
  not a terrorist organisation. I lived through the IRA and the bombing in
  London when you had to leave shops and leave museums because bombs might go
  off any minute. Frankly, that is what a terrorist organisation is. This is not
  a terrorist organisation, it’s a direct action organisation, like the
  suffragists, like the Greenham Common women, like many other organisations.
  “If people do direct action and they cause criminal damage, then you arrest
  the people, you charge them [under existing laws], and that’s that.” As well
  as free speech concerns, her longstanding support for the Palestinian cause
  led her to risk arrest. “What’s going on in Gaza has gone beyond anything that
  one could possibly have imagined,” said Hinton. “I can’t even think about it,
  it’s too awful.” Hinton said she was shaking as the officers moved down the
  line of placard holders arresting each person as they went. An officer then
  told her that if she put down her placard she could leave without further
  action. “I knew I couldn’t do that, but it was such a temptation because it
  was so terrifying,” said Hinton. “I’ve been a very law-abiding citizen and
  very respectful of authority all my life but I knew I had to do this and it
  was my duty to do this.” Hinton said it was right that her generation were
  putting themselves on the frontline. “Young people are going to jeopardise
  their careers,” she said. “They won’t get a visa to go to the [United] States.
  They won’t get a visa to go to most other countries because they’ll have
  terrorism on their record. “People like me, who are elderly, we can afford it.
  I’m very sorry not to go and be able to visit my niece in America but it’s not
  the end of the world. Young people shouldn’t be doing this, we should be doing
  this. We should be taking the responsibility.” * * * ‘Don’t call these people
  terrorists’ Father John McGowan, 75 John McGowan, a Catholic priest, said that
  when Yvette Cooper was in opposition he felt she “spoke for me”. But asked
  what he would say to the home secretary now, he replied: “For goodness sake,
  don’t call these people terrorists because they’re not terrorists. “The focus
  shouldn’t be on Palestine Action. The focus should be on what the government
  isn’t doing for the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.” McGowan, a
  Carmelite and parish priest of St Joseph’s in Chalfont St Peter, was one of
  532 people arrested at the demonstration in Parliament Square on 9 August, the
  largest against the proscription of the organisation to date. He said he had
  written in his diary a week or two before the protest that he would like to be
  arrested in support of the cause, so when the demonstration was announced it
  was the opportunity he was looking for. He attended wearing his Roman collar,
  identifying himself as a priest, and met a Baptist minister there who was also
  arrested. After being detained, McGowan was placed in a police van where there
  were two female officers that he said were “polite, and almost apologetic. I
  sat down, and I felt very calm and almost serene.” When the van drove away, he
  said people cheered in support of him and the two other protesters in the
  vehicle, banging on the van and making the heart sign to them. “It was a
  strain, but exhilarating as well. It was an extraordinary day, I’ve never had
  a day like it in my life but I’m glad I did it. In my conscience, I was clear
  it was the right thing to do so I take that as my guiding light. If I get a
  criminal record, I don’t care.” He said he was not expecting any
  recriminations from the Catholic church and had experienced a moving response
  from his congregation. “I was in two minds whether to tell the people in my
  church what I’d done but I’m the kind of person that likes to share these
  things and so I did,” he said. “I was really nervous but at the end of mass I
  said: ‘Look, I went to the demonstration, I got arrested’ and they applauded
  me. I was almost in tears.” * * * ‘People are now extremely distrustful of the
  government’ Chris Romberg, 75 A former British army colonel and ex-military
  attache, Chris Romberg cut an unlikely terrorism suspect even among hundreds
  of other retirees arrested in Parliament Square in relation to Palestine
  Action. Yet it is this background – along with the fact that his father and
  grandparents fled Nazi Germany in 1938 – that motivated him to join the
  protest, leading to his arrest under the Terrorism Act. “This year saw the
  80th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp by
  British forces. What they found shocked the British people,” said Romberg, who
  himself saw action in the Falklands war with the commando regiment and was
  mentioned in dispatches. “What we are seeing now in Gaza, 80 years on, is
  equally shocking. As a former officer in the British army, I am horrified that
  the government is misusing our armed forces to be complicit in the genocide
  rather than to end it.” Claims by Cooper that those protesting “don’t know the
  full nature” of Palestine Action have also struck a nerve. “The impression I
  get is that people are now extremely distrustful of the government,” said
  Romberg, who left the army in 2007. “That the home secretary should speak like
  that and say that she has information but can’t tell us what it is reminds me
  of the Monty Python sketch about the Piranha brothers, where there is a man
  who had his head nailed to a coffee table because he had broken an unwritten
  law but they wouldn’t tell him what it was.” The former diplomat’s last two
  appointments were as defence attache at the British embassies in Jordan and
  Egypt, and he speaks knowledgeably about the region. Since leaving the army,
  he has become active in supporting the Palestinian cause. Recently, he joined
  the group Holocaust Survivors and Descendants against the Gaza Genocide, other
  members of which stood together under a banner during the protest on Saturday.
  It was the first time he had been arrested in his life. Before taking part, he
  reflected a lot on what he was about to do. “It wasn’t a decision I took
  lightly and the organisers, Defend Our Juries, made absolutely sure that
  everybody realised the implications of what they were doing, and yet people
  felt strongly enough that they were able and were prepared to take that risk.”
  * * * ‘People have not been listened to on Gaza’ Richard Whitmore-Jones, 74
  Richard Whitmore-Jones readily admits he “doesn’t particularly approve” of the
  methods deployed by Palestine Action, the direct action group proscribed last
  month. “I was brought up to respect property,” he said. Yet in his next
  breath, the retired company director makes an argument few might expect from a
  former executive at the multinational beverage company Diageo. “I was
  certainly in horror of vandalism but I have to admit that people have not been
  listened to on Gaza. There have been enormous marches in London and they have
  not been reported accurately or were kept off the front pages. “Palestine
  Action’s methods sit very uneasily with me. It’s difficult to accept that
  vandalism is the only way to go. However, I feel we have to do something and I
  support their stand against genocide.” Whitmore-Jones, from East Sussex, was
  arrested on Saturday having also been previously arrested at another protest
  organised by Defend Our Juries, returning with the same placard stating: “I
  oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.” He has been bailed to appear at
  a police station in October. As for the decision to put himself in line for
  arrest not once but twice, Whitmore-Jones cites being part of a generation
  whose parents fought fascism in the second world war, which in his own case
  included an RAF father who became a prisoner of the Japanese. “I am astonished
  that we now have a government that has been supporting exactly the sort of
  actions, in Gaza, which Britain sought to prevent 80 years ago. My father’s
  sacrifice, which he saw as being to prevent other peoples from being invaded
  and treated badly, appears to be contrary to what our government is doing,” he
  said. For much of his working life, Whitmore-Jones was with Diageo, rising to
  become a property manager and office services manager at the company, retiring
  in 2003 shortly after it was taken over. He “came late” to activism for Gaza,
  going on his first ever march when he was 72. “I felt better for doing
  something, though I realised I was doing very little really,” he said, before
  the proscription of Palestine Action changed everything again for him. He
  shrugs off the suggestion that he was now making a sacrifice by facing a
  potential terrorism conviction and the life-changing limitations that come
  with it, insisting: “Look, I’m 74, I don’t have a mortgage to get, I don’t
  have a job. I will be a little bit upset about not being allowed to go to
  America, but I really will live with that. It’s the young people that are
  brave.” As for his family’s views of what he is doing, Whitmore-Jones said:
  “It’s gone from amusement to absolute firm support and I’m very pleased with
  the attitude of my children.” Family, in a way, is also at the heart of his
  motivation for seeking to oppose Israel’s actions in Gaza: “This is about
  children the age of my grandchildren having their limbs and their lives taken
  away.” * * * ‘Ridiculous judicial overreach’ Trevelyan Evans, 64 After leading
  a “wonderful, full life”, the TV screenwriter Trevelyan Evans, who has written
  for a number of BBC sitcoms, is unafraid of being called a terrorist in the
  courts. “I’m very proud to have made this stand, whether I’m convicted or
  not,” he said. He was among the 532 people, many of them “old fogies”,
  arrested last Saturday. “People in my demographic are standing up for those
  people who can’t risk having a conviction on their records for a terrorism
  offence,” he said. He felt compelled to take part in the protest to stand up
  for “the people of Gaza and Palestine who are being massacred” and to oppose
  the group’s proscription, which he called an “obviously ridiculous judicial
  overreach on behalf of the government”. “They just slapped this ban on them in
  order to suppress opposition,” he added. Before the demonstration began last
  weekend, he jokingly said he got his “materials for terrorism” ready on the
  green in Parliament Square. His tools of choice? A pen and piece of paper. “I
  never realised being a terrorist could be so much fun,” he said. “Being out in
  the open air and meeting new people in a nice central location … it was a
  convivial atmosphere.” After the silent portion of the protest ended, Evans
  said people were “handing out sandwiches and sun cream” until an officer with
  “seven of his friends came round” and told him he was being arrested. They
  then started to carry him out of the square. “I hadn’t been carried around
  like that since I was at school,” he said. “The policeman said: ‘You’re a bit
  heavy.’ He had to call one of his friends over to help carry me. I thought
  that was a bit of a liberty.” After this, he was placed in a police van, which
  he had all to himself. “I think, on behalf of the Metropolitan police, it was
  quite generous.” Evans is on bail awaiting charge. He said the government’s
  decision to ban Palestine Action represented a “kind of creeping
  authoritarianism [which is] eventually going to hit a wall, because it’s
  inherently contradictory”. “If you extend draconian laws, eventually you’re
  going to look pretty stupid. I can see that the government laid itself a trap
  and walked straight into it.” • This article was amended on 16 August 2025.
  Owing to an editing error an earlier version said the protesters’ alleged
  crime was calling for an end to the ban against Palestine Action. Their
  alleged crime is expressing support for the group.
