  It is a conundrum of our temperate latitudes that the season we associate with
  life’s fullest extent is the period when the “biophony” (nature’s collective
  music) is at its most restricted. There is greater insect sound (flies, bees,
  grasshoppers) but birdsong has fallen away and, in a sense, I find the silence
  disconcerting, because it expresses the end of all that upwelling life of the
  past 10 weeks. In its way, summer is more melancholy than any other time of
  year. I also love the silence, however, as I sit here at last light. Summer’s
  residue of music is foregrounded by the stillness: young whitethroats chakking
  at our hedge: the curling line of autumn’s first robin and a late thrush,
  banging out a dozen half-hearted notes before succumbing to the wider mood.
  Alas, the silence brings out in stark contrast the curse of the Peak District:
  motorbike noise. It is, of course, a minority who bypass MOT engine checks or
  illegally disable the silencer to maximise their violent output. But how does
  one assess the motives of one (and all I’ve seen so far are men) who, in the
  small hours of night, awakens an entire population, as he maps his route for
  miles through town and out over the moors, with poisonous decibels? Noise is a
  pollution that elevates cortisol and adrenaline levels and can ultimately be
  fatal, for our species and every other. We are now alive to the toxic
  conditions of our waterways, but solving those decades of abuse will be
  complicated. Getting rid of noise pollution would surely be straightforward.
  In Paris they have radars that record noise as well as speed. Several hundred
  of them, spread at hotspots such as ours, would surely go a long way to
  eliminating the cause. Silence returns as darkness falls. It lets you meditate
  on the tiniest details as well as the grandest themes. I’m pondering if that
  microscopic rustle of leaves beneath our viburnum is a frog or toad. And what
  kind of soundlessness, you wonder, attends the holy whoosh of the Earth as it
  journeys across the 125,000 miles in the time it took me to write these words?
