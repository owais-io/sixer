  Levi’s has said that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump
  tariffs and governmental policies” could drive British shoppers away from its
  denim. The company, which distributes Levi’s and Dockers clothing brands,
  issued the warning in its UK accounts, where it reported sales had risen 8.8%
  to £96.8m and pre-tax profits were up 23% to £9.6m. It said the Levi’s brand
  had “retained its attractiveness despite a tense consumer climate and
  declining customer frequency in the retail sector”. However, the accounts
  recently filed at Companies House listed one of its key risks and
  uncertainties was potentially changing sentiment towards US brands that could
  lead shoppers to develop “increasing willingness” to choose more “national or
  European” products. The risk was listed alongside other issues including
  competition from retailer’s own-label products and pressure on its department
  store stockists from “increased online competition and inflexible rents”. It
  said apparel brands were also competing with “more basic needs” and there was
  a risk that high inflation “has a direct impact on the willingness and ability
  of consumer to spend their reduced available money in apparel and fashion
  products”. Levi’s UK arm, which employs just over 1,600 people in the UK
  according to its accounts, is one of the first US brands to openly raise fears
  about the impact of the Trump administration on sales, in comments first
  reported by the Daily Telegraph. One brand that has clearly suffered in the UK
  is Tesla, which is led by Donald Trump’s former right-hand man Elon Musk.
  Tesla sales in the UK more than halved in July, according to data from the
  main industry body. The electric vehicle brand’s UK market share shrank to
  0.7% in July, from 1.67% a year ago. In Canada, protests against US-derived
  goods has been blamed for a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s whiskey, which
  many retailers have removed from their shelves. There have been reports of
  Canadian shoppers turning US-made or owned products upside down in stores so
  they can be identified and avoided by fellow shoppers. The Maple Scan app also
  helps Canadians check barcodes to see if grocery purchases have parent
  companies in the US. Trump has sent shock waves through global trade with his
  “liberation day” tariffs that set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s
  trading partners, and were topped up with “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he
  has argued have unfairly treated the US. A federal appeals court in Washington
  DC ruled on Friday that most of the tariff policies were illegal in a ruling
  that will not take effect until 14 October. The judgment is likely to lead to
  a supreme court decision on whether Trump has the legal right as president to
  decide US trade policy.
