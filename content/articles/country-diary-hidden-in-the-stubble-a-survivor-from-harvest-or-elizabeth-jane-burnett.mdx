  In one of the last fields of wheat to be cut, a large white butterfly skims
  the top of the parched crop. The two black dots on each flapping forewing
  bring a polka-dot touch to the monochrome field. Through the heat, its flutter
  brings a welcome motion. Otherwise, it is still, quiet, only the sound of
  fallen stems crunching underfoot. Where the butterfly lands, a cluster of
  oxeye daisies gleams, sheltered from the glare by the wheat. In the next
  field, the hill rises, newly shorn. The sky blares blue above low gold stalks,
  no trace of cloud, no breath of wind. In the stripped fields, there are tiny
  patches of white, where wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) has survived. It
  has many other common names, including wild charlock, runch, wild turnip and
  wild kale, as well as several variations of radish: jointed, jointed wild,
  fodder, and the more generic moniker, white weed. Raphanus stems from the
  Greek for appearing quickly, in line with its rapid germination. It is able to
  flower several times a year, has a deep taproot, and its seeds can lie dormant
  in the soil for years. This resilience, enhanced by its flowering below the
  cutting height and ability to shed seeds just before harvest, lessens the
  impact of this seasonal disturbance. As a cover crop, this white “weed”, as
  some see it, can improve soil health. Its deep root system breaks up compacted
  soil, and improves water penetration and aeration. All parts of the plant are
  edible, giving a peppery taste, and it is also a food source for many insects
  and birds, and a host for the large white butterfly’s larvae. Another of the
  butterfly’s common names, cabbage white, and its Latin name, Pieris brassicae,
  also reflect the longstanding link between insect and plant, since the radish
  is a member of the Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage) family. When another
  white butterfly floats over the sandy stubble and flits around the radish’s
  petals, it is like a ripple of water in an oasis. A small movement through the
  heat; a tiny cloud, a breath of wing. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of
