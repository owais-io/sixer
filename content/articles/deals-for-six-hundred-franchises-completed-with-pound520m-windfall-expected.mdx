  The ECB has announced that deals for six of the eight Hundred franchises have
  been completed, with a total windfall of £520m expected once paperwork for the
  final two teams is finalised later this year. The sales process was completed
  in February, when eight parties entered into an exclusivity period having
  agreed deals which valued the teams at a combined £975m. Work has been ongoing
  to formalise the sales over the last five months, with the process described
  as being “in the final straight” as long ago as April, with signatures at that
  point expected “very, very soon”. But the complexity of the legal arrangements
  – one county executive said 73 different contracts had to be agreed and signed
  off before the sale of a minority stake in their one franchise could be
  completed – and the new investors’ desire to have as much control as possible
  over the competition’s future combined to delay the announcement. The
  completed deals involve the purchase of 49% stakes in Birmingham Phoenix,
  Southern Brave and the Lord’s-based London Spirit, a 50% stake in Welsh Fire,
  70% in Manchester Originals and the complete takeover of Northern
  Superchargers by India’s Sun TV network. Oval Invincibles and Trent Rockets
  remain in the process of finalising deals for 49% stakes, which are expected
  to conclude by the end of September. Proceeds are to be shared between
  professional counties and the grassroots game. “This investment will not only
  fuel the competition’s growth but also channel transformative levels of
  funding into our professional counties and grassroots game,” said Richard
  Thompson, the ECB chair. “This will ensure cricket continues to thrive at all
  levels across England and Wales for generations to come, supporting our
  broader ambitions to become the country’s most inclusive sport and driving
  cricket into harder to reach and under-served communities.” The ECB retains
  ownership of the competition itself, its regulations and the length and timing
  of the window in which it is played. But the investors will hold various
  vetos, including over its potential future expansion, and alongside the ECB
  and host counties will be represented on a new Hundred board. “The Hundred has
  created a stage where tradition meets innovation and fans of all ages are
  tuning in,” said Kaviya Maran, head of sports at Sun TV. “It’s a gamechanger
  and we are here to help push it even further. For someone who is passionate
  about the game’s future, especially bringing more women and younger fans into
  it, this investment felt like a no brainer.”
