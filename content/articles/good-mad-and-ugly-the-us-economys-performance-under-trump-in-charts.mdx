  According to Donald Trump’s White House, the US economy is booming, inflation
  is dead and jobs are surging. A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall
  on such claims in recent days. This week’s data on Trump’s early economic
  record was mixed – good, mad and ugly – with jobs numbers so weak he reached
  for the catchphrase he once used to build himself into a reality TV star:
  you’re fired. The picture is chaotic, with robust headline growth in the
  world’s largest economy, wild swings in trade, and a remarkable slowdown in
  the labor market. For six months, Trump has staged an extraordinary campaign
  to overhaul the global economy and extract concessions from Washington’s
  allies and rivals by threatening and imposing steep tariffs on their US
  exports. But the unpredictable, erratic rollout of this strategy has already
  had bizarre consequences. Resilient-ish growth On the surface, at least, this
  week’s deluge of data opened with good news: the US economy returned to growth
  in the second quarter, with gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of
  economic health – expanding at a rate not seen since last summer. But this
  followed an unexpected contraction in the first quarter, and underlined some
  more concerning figures, such as a 15.6% drop in private domestic investment.
  Businesses have been struggling to keep up with the hour-by-hour jerks and
  jolts on sweeping economies policies. Yes, there was good growth in the last
  quarter but in the first six months, the US economy grew at a mediocre 1.2%.
  The Wall Street Journal called it “the weirdest GDP report ever”. Imports
  surge and plunge Delve a bit deeper, and you start to see how the US economy
  is grappling with a series of extraordinary forces as Trump hammers out his
  trade strategy. Firms spent much of the first quarter waiting for the
  president to reveal his plans for tariffs: which countries would be targeted,
  at what rates, and when. They stockpiled, triggering an unprecedented surge in
  imports that pushed growth into the red. In the second quarter, however, as
  Trump started to ramp up his economic attacks, imports tumbled at an equally
  astonishing pace. Net exports – how much a country exports more than it
  imports – boosted GDP. Interest rates on hold This is Trump’s least favorite
  chart. Despite his many public demands, threats and attacks, the Federal
  Reserve has not yet cut interest rates this year. Why? Jerome Powell, the
  central bank’s chair, has repeatedly argued it should wait and see the impact
  of the president’s trade strategy before moving. Fed officials are worried
  that inflation – despite Trump’s claims that it has collapsed on his watch –
  has actually remained stubborn, and might rise as a result of his tariffs.
  This has gone down extremely poorly in the White House, where officials are
  counting down the weeks until Powell’s term as chair ends next May. Jobs
  growth stalls Data released on Friday fundamentally changed the way US
  policymakers and politicians think about the economy. Until then, many inside
  the Fed thought everything was broadly ticking over nicely – and Trump
  administration officials claimed they were overseeing a boom in activity. But
  July’s employment report revealed far fewer jobs were created that month than
  economists had expected, and revised down estimates for May and June by an
  astonishing 258,000. Job creation has stalled. “Look, this jobs report isn’t
  ideal,” Stephen Miran, chairman of the White House council of economic
  advisers, told CNN, before suggesting that fading uncertainty around trade and
  fiscal policy would lead to significant improvement. “It’s all going to get
  much, much better from here,” he added.
