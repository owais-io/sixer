  Nine Entertainment is considering legal action against Bob Katter after the
  independent MP called Nine’s Queensland reporter Josh Bavas a racist and
  threatened to punch him at a press conference. The Brisbane outburst came
  after Katter expressed support for anti-immigration March for Australia
  protests planned for the weekend. Bavas asked: “You’ve got Lebanese heritage
  yourself … ” before Katter cut him off. The member for Kennedy walked up to
  the Channel Nine reporter and shook his fist at him. “Don’t say that, because
  you’re a racist. You’re a racist. You cannot say what you just said without
  being identified as a racist … this man is a racist,” Katter said. The
  exchange was filmed. Nine executives were discussing taking defamation action
  against Katter, sources said. The company has demanded an apology from Katter.
  Bavas was criticised online by people who appeared to agree with Katter and
  called on the reporter to apologise because “he was the one doing the
  baiting”. Katter, 80, said on Thursday that Bavas was not “a proper
  Australian, a fair-minded Australian”. “I punch blokes in the mouth for saying
  that, don’t you dare say that,” Katter told the reporter. “My family have been
  in this country for 140 years. I have, on many occasions, punched blokes in
  the mouth, right? So I’m restraining myself today. Don’t say it!” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Katter refused to take more questions from Bavas, who
  continued to ask about his views on migration. Bavas, who has covered Katter
  for more than 15 years as a former ABC north Queensland reporter, said he was
  surprised by the outburst as he believed the question was benign. “In an
  extraordinary press conference where a federal parliamentarian was talking
  about taking names on lists and deportation of residents, I was trying to ask
  a question about the value migrant Australian families, including the Katters
  and my own family, bring to this nation through shared values,” he said in a
  statement on Friday. “In my near 20 years in journalism, I’ve never
  experienced that kind of reaction from an elected representative.” Nine’s
  executive director of news and current affairs, Fiona Dear, said Bavas was
  just doing his job. “Mr Katter’s aggressive behaviour and threats were
  unacceptable,” Dear said. “His baseless and offensive accusation of racism is
  an irresponsible attempt to shut down a legitimate line of questioning and
  warrants a public apology from Mr Katter. We stand by Josh Bavas and will
  continue to report without fear or favour.” Former MP George Christensen
  subsequently posted on Facebook that people should disrespect journalists –
  alongside a drawing of a muscular boxing kangaroo with an Australian flag.
  “After Bob Katter’s spray, it’s your patriotic duty to disrespect
  journalists,” he said. Many of the 600 comments were supportive of the
  sentiment and called on Bavas to apologise to Katter. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, was critical of Katter on Friday. “Bob Katter I like, but
  Bob Katter needs to have a look at that footage. Have a look at himself,
  frankly, and recognise that that’s just not what we expect of any Australian,
  let alone someone who’s in public office,” he told Nine. “You’re speaking to
  someone called Albanese. We’ve got a Senate leader called Wong. Migration
  enriches. Except for the First Australians, we’re all either migrants or
  descendants of them.” The Coalition senator Jane Hume called for Katter to
  face consequences for threatening violence. “You should always be able to feel
  safe and respected at work – journalists and politicians,” she told the ABC on
  Friday. “The idea of threatening violence is entirely unacceptable. There must
  be consequences.” Katter’s grandfather, Carlyle Assad Khittar, migrated from
  Lebanon in 1898. Bavas later in Thursday’s press conference reminded Katter
  that they had spoken before about his Lebanese heritage. Katter has previously
  become angry when asked about his ancestry in the context of his
  anti-immigration views. In 2018, he told Sky News reporter Tom Connell that he
  needed “a big hiding” for raising the issue, saying it was “racist”. Bavas
  said his full question to Katter, which was cut off, was: “You’ve got Lebanese
  heritage yourself, what’s your message for hard-working migrants who come here
  and have the shared values you have?” Queensland police said they were “aware
  of an incident that was presented in the media yesterday at Speakers’ Corner,
  Brisbane City”. “Police have not received a formal complaint regarding this
  incident at this time,” a spokesperson said. Katter was contacted for comment.
