  Benjamin Netanyahu is “in denial” over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,
  Anthony Albanese claimed after a phone call with the Israeli leader, saying
  frustration with Israel’s military campaign in the besieged territory was part
  of Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state. The prime minister’s
  escalating public criticism of Israel comes as the French president, Emmanuel
  Macron, overnight welcomed Australia’s commitment to recognise Palestinian
  statehood at the UN general assembly in September. “I spoke with Prime
  Minister Netanyahu. He, again, reiterated to me what he has said publicly as
  well – which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for
  innocent people,” Albanese told ABC TV. Albanese yesterday said Australia’s
  pledge to recognise a Palestinian state was “predicated” on conditions agreed
  to by the Palestinian Authority, which included no role for terror group Hamas
  in a future government. The prime minister said the international community
  could block Hamas from standing in future elections in Palestine, but refused
  to say whether Australia would revoke its plans to recognise if such
  conditions were not met. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “You can [stop Hamas
  from standing in elections] if you have the Arab states in the Middle East all
  speaking as one, as well as the Palestinian Authority, as well as the
  international community. Yes, you can,” he told Nine. In a press conference,
  Albanese went on to say that violence in the region, including Israel’s
  planned military occupation of Gaza City, “just cannot continue into the
  future without an end point”. “The international community is coming up with
  an end point, which is, how do we resolve this? How do we get a permanent
  security position?” he said. Macron, who declared in July that France would
  recognise Palestinian statehood at the General Assembly, said Australia was
  “joining the momentum” of a global push toward resolving the crisis in Gaza.
  “This reflects our commitment to the two-state solution and to the need to
  collectively rebuild a political pathway, without which there can be no peace
  and security for all,” he wrote. There are a raft of unanswered questions
  including how the Palestinian state would be formed, how it would be
  demilitarised and where Australia would establish an embassy. Albanese and the
  foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, shrugged off repeated questions in media
  interviews on Monday and Tuesday about how Australia would respond if the
  Palestinian Authority’s commitments were not met, or if they would reverse
  their recognition pledge. “What we will also do is work with the international
  community to hold the Palestinian Authority to its commitments,” Wong told the
  ABC’s 7.30 program on Monday night. The Coalition opposition is critical of
  the Labor government’s decision, claiming it rewards Hamas, and that the
  government has failed to answer outstanding questions. The opposition leader,
  Sussan Ley, said on Tuesday a future Coalition government would revoke
  Palestinian recognition, raising questions about how such a diplomatic
  backflip could be executed three or six years into the future of a newly
  established Palestine. The Coalition opposed Monday’s decision from the Labor
  government, claiming Palestinian recognition was a reward for Hamas. Ley said
  in a statement that the Coalition’s shadow cabinet resolved to oppose a
  Palestinian state and also “resolved that recognition would be revoked by a
  Coalition government”. The Coalition will remain in opposition until at least
  2028, and potentially longer. Ley’s statement did not go into how Australia
  would diplomatically untangle recognition of a Palestinian state, three or six
  years down the track, or how un-recognising a Palestinian state would help
  contribute to the peace process between Israel and Palestine, or assist
  broader cohesion in the Middle East. The former Liberal prime minister Scott
  Morrison claimed Jewish Australians would feel a “sense of betrayal” at the
  government’s shift. “It will prove a hollow gesture, like for all those who
  have taken this step before it,” Morrison wrote on his website. “None should
  take any comfort in it. Meanwhile the suffering will regrettably continue in
  Gaza and the hostages will remain in captivity.” Israel’s government has been
  deeply critical of Albanese’s decision, and also said Labor is rewarding
  Hamas. In a statement on X, Israel’s deputy minister of foreign affairs,
  Sharren Haskel, said the move was about domestic politics, not peace. “Fifty
  of our hostages remain in Hamas’s dungeons of torture, being starved to death
  – being forced to dig their own graves – yet the Australian government has
  decided now is the right time to reward the monsters of October 7 with
  recognition of a Palestinian state,” she wrote. “This decision by Australia
  won’t change anything in Israel or Gaza, but let’s be quite clear, this is all
  about domestic politics, not peace.”
