  Ben Fisher was at Molineux tonight. Here’s his report. Thanks for reading this
  MBM. Vítor Pereira’s turn to talk to Sky. “We faced a strong team …
  technically strong, individually strong … but we created a lot of chances to
  score … a lot of opportunities … when we committed a mistake, they punished us
  … when we had a chance to score we didn’t score … of course I’m not happy …
  but we played with courage … not just to defend … to create … press them … but
  if I don’t see the match, the result does not translate what happened … I will
  keep in my mind the good things … and start to correct the things we need to
  correct … try to be better in the next game … we keep going with work … I hope
  the club can help us with new signings … more quality … they are working until
  the end of the market … hopefully we can bring three or four players at
  least.” Pep Guardiola, all mellow contentment, speaks to Sky. “First half
  good, second no … the attitude and many, many things was good … it’s good to
  [have things to] improve winning 0-4 … the new players come and we have a
  bigger squad … we have to reduce the squad because it will be difficult to
  sustain the vibe of the team … it is a good result but no more than that …
  it’s a good result, no more than that … last season we started against Chelsea
  0-2 … look what happened later … be patient … improve … in general it was
  good.” He’s also asked about Ederson. Is he for the off? “The club will inform
  me … I don’t know anything.” Wolves weren’t completely toothless this evening.
  They unsettled Manchester City for a few minutes before Erling Haaland’s
  opener; had Marshall Munetsi read City’s offside trap a wee bit better, they
  could even have taken the lead, and perhaps the story would have been
  different. Perhaps. But given the way City subsequently outclassed them, these
  are huge ifs and buts. Tijjani Reijnders enjoyed an outstanding debut for
  City: his scooped pass to Rico Lewis unlocked the Wolves defence for the
  game’s opener, and he went on to score a fine goal of his own, plus an assist.
  It could hardly have gone better for the former Milan midfielder … and Rayan
  Cherki and James Trafford had mighty fine debuts as well. A perfect day for
  City, pretty much; they’ll be serious contenders for this season’s title. As
  for Wolves, let’s see whether or not a relegation scrap awaits them: upcoming
  games against Bournemouth (a), West Ham (h) and Everton (h) will tell us more
  about that. Reijnders adds: “Last season City didn’t win the Premier League
  and that is our main goal, to win the Premier League … we all know what we
  want … we are really sharp to reach that goal … I want to show that I am proud
  to play for this club, especially with a lot of fun and a lot of love.” The
  magnificent Tijjani Reijnders, player of the match on debut, talks to Sky
  Sports. “It’s a really nice start of course, to start with a goal and assist …
  especially in the Premier League, it’s a thing you’ve always dreamed about …
  couldn’t be better … the first game of the season, you don’t know what will
  happen, how the opponent will play … they put some pressure on us but we
  stayed calm … I have a new view [under Pep Guardiola] on how to play
  football.” Molineux continues to chant for their Diogo. Players and manager
  thank the fans for their tribute by facing them and applauding, shades of
  Liverpool at Preston. Someone lays Jota’s old-gold number 18 shirt on the turf
  he once graced. Bittersweet and beautiful, the song goes on and on. A
  pulsating sound that will drift into the Wolverhampton sky for quite a while
  this evening, and perhaps stick in the mind forever. City want their title
  back. 90 min +7: Wolves might be losing, but their fans are currently in fine
  voice. They’re singing a metronomic “Diogo” chant in honour of their beloved
  former star. It’s a wonderful tribute, and a beautiful noise. 90 min +5:
  Gonzalez gets up and winces quite a bit, but doesn’t appear to have done any
  serious damage, his arm moving freely. 90 min +4: Gonzalez goes down awkwardly
  on his left arm … and stays down. He grimaces quite a lot. On comes the
  trainer. 90 min +3: Lopez attempts a curler towards the bottom left. No power
  behind it. Easy for Trafford. 90 min +2: “Kevin who?” wonders Martin Shields.
  90 min +1: Marmoush witlessly bashes the ball into the wall. There will be
  seven minutes of added time, incidentally. 90 min: Marmoush dribbles along the
  face of the Wolves box, and is cynically upended by Gomes inches shy of the
  white line. So no penalty, but it’s a free kick in a dangerous position, just
  to the left of the D. 89 min: On Sky Sports, summariser Alan Smith names
  Tijjani Reijnders as his player of the match. He’ll get no argument from
  anyone. 88 min: “Manchester City, top of the league,” bellow the away fans.
  They’re not technically wrong, even if it is a bit early to be going large
  with this. 86 min: The fight has understandably gone out of Wolves. Both teams
  would declare now. 84 min: O’Reilly is booked for a poor tackle, made quite a
  long time ago when the referee waved play on for an advantage, on … dunno …
  can’t remember … Peter Broadbent? Norman Deeley? Ron Flowers? It was a long
  time ago. 82 min: A sub apiece. Stones is replaced by Khusanov, while Hwang
  comes on for Strand Larsen. Cherki dances his way left to right along the
  curve of the Wolves D, before threading a shot into the bottom left. Another
  City new boy scores on his Premier League debut! 80 min: Cherki pings a couple
  of triangles down the right with O’Reilly, who crosses through an empty box. A
  waste of some fine build-up. No matter, though, because … 78 min: The
  quadruple change has given Wolves some new energy, but it’s all huff and puff.
  City look completely comfortable. 76 min: Strand Larsen cuts in from the left
  and takes a whack. Trafford parries away from danger with strong hands. 74
  min: … and City respond to that slew of subs by replacing Haaland for Cherki,
  another Premier League debutant. 73 min: Wolves respond to City’s changes with
  a quadruple substitution. Moller Wolfe, Bellegarde, Hoever and Andre make way
  for Rodrigo Gomes, Hugo Bueno, Arias and Lopez, the latter pair making their
  Premier League debuts. 71 min: City stroke it around in their patient
  time-honoured style. 69 min: Meanwhile Nunes’s first act is to usher the ball
  out for a goal kick, much to the annoyance of Moller Wolfe, snapping at his
  ankles. Oh, and the crowd, who aren’t letting this one go. Pantomime boos
  a-plenty! 67 min: Marmoush’s first act is to draw a rash foul out of Doherty,
  who goes into the book. “Haaland is unstoppable,” opines Mary Waltz. “Send him
  the Golden Boot already. It is inevitable.” 66 min: City make a triple change.
  Lewis, Doku and Silva are replaced by Nunes, Marmoush and O’Reilly. Nunes,
  formerly of Wolves, cops for some panto pelters. 65 min: That was Haaland’s
  tenth Premier League goal against Wolves, who now sit atop his personal list.
  West Ham are next on it, having been on the end of his absurd talent nine
  times. 63 min: Strand Larsen and Lewis point, paw and bicker at each other
  awhile. The referee tells them both to stop playing silly buggers. This is an
  absolutely wonderful goal. Trafford launches a long pass down the right.
  Reijnders takes it down from the sky with a cushioned touch. He one-twos down
  the inside-right channel with Bobb, enters the box, then cuts back for
  Haaland, who smacks a low shot across Sa and into the bottom left. Sa might
  have got a stronger hand to it, but nevertheless, what a move, what a team
  goal. What a player Reijnders is! 59 min: A free kick for Wolves out on the
  right. With everyone lined up on the edge of the box, awaiting the cross,
  Bellegarde surprises everyone except Strand Larsen by slipping a cute pass
  down the inside-right channel. Strand Larsen doesn’t quite catch his shot
  properly, but it balloons up, forcing Trafford to tip over. Nothing comes of
  the resulting corner, but the last few minutes have given Wolves a little bit
  of hope as they search for the goal that would get them back into the game. 57
  min: Munetsi makes bueno down the right and fizzes a low ball through the City
  six-yard box. There’s nobody there in Old Gold to poke home. 56 min: Doku
  chases after a long pass in the hope of breaking clear on goal. But the
  whistle goes, because the opportunity only arose after Haaland had smacked
  into Toti. 54 min: Bellegarde nips in ahead of Reijnders in the centre circle.
  He’s got Moller Wolfe in space on the left, and a counter-attack is on. So
  Reijnders takes one for the team, cynically nudging him from behind. A yellow
  card to go with his goal and assist-to-the-assist for the opener. 52 min:
  Strand Larsen returns. With little else going on, Pat Collins peruses the
  team-sheets downpage in the MBM. “At least Vitor Pereira can turn to his bench
  with a look of deep consideration on his face and exclaim ‘Oh! Good-Good!’,”
  he quips, before having the decency to apologise in lower case. “sorry” 50
  min: Strand Larsen requires some treatment after clashing knees with
  Ait-Nouri. He looks in some pain. He eventually gets up and hobbles to the
  touchline, though he needs more time. Wolves down to ten for the moment. 48
  min: Hoever, on the right, plays a glorious first-time crossfield pass towards
  Moller Wolfe, who would have been clear on goal had he controlled. Reader, he
  did not control. A fine opportunity flies out of play. What vision from
  Hoever, though. 46 min: Almost a perfect start to the half for Wolves, as
  Doherty rolls a long pass down the right for Hoever, whose low cross finds
  Strand Larsen, ten yards out. Strand Larsen looks to guide a shot into the
  bottom right, but his effort whistles inches wide. Trafford might have had it
  covered; he might not. Wolves get the second half started. No changes.
  Half-time postbag. “Contrary to what you might see in the Canadian or
  Scandinavian tundra, Reijnders has absolutely terrorised Wolves” – Peter Oh
  “These headlines write themselves: Reijnders guides the slay” – Chiwode “I’m
  thinking back to famous Wolves-City clashes from the past, and those
  barrel-chested, fag-smoking greats Mike Bailey and Franny Lee. Barrel chests
  are sadly a thing of the past in these nutrition-specialist, controlled-diet
  days” – Jeremy Boyce “Is it true that the pea in Jarred Gillett’s whistle is
  the only one in the Premier League to rotate in a clockwise direction?” –
  Justin Kavanagh That’s why they’re champions a good shout to become champions
  for the seventh time in nine seasons. 45 min +4: Reijnders wins a corner down
  the right. Silva hits it long. Haaland flicks it on to Doku, whose bodyshape,
  mid-jump, is all wrong to either control or shoot from close range. Doku might
  have anticipated that flick-on better. That perhaps should have been 0-3. 45
  min +2: Lewis attempts to shepherd a ball out for a goal kick, but he’s
  hassled from behind by Munetsi and is forced into conceding a corner. He
  claims to have been illegally skittled from behind, and he’s got a point, but
  the referee’s not buying it. The resulting corner nearly leads to a chance,
  too, as it’s hit long for Gomes, who can’t quite get a shot away on the
  right-hand edge of the six-yard box. His eventual dinked cross is plucked from
  the sky by Trafford. 45 min +1: Hoever curls a cross in from the right. Strand
  Larsen attempts to sweep home from the penalty spot, but he’s half-falling and
  gets the job all wrong. Trafford claims. The flag would have gone up for
  offside anyway. 45 min: Bad news for Wolves: there will be five additional
  first-half minutes. 44 min: Silva takes that corner. Dias wins a header.
  Haaland competes for another. The ball’s half-cleared. Doku performs a cute
  back-heel on the right touchline. This particular period of pressure
  eventually comes to nothing, but Wolves could do with hearing the half-time
  whistle. They were looking good for a brief moment or two, but now they’re
  chasing shadows. 43 min: … City win a corner out on the left, a result of
  Doku’s twisting and turning. 42 min: Munetsi is OK to continue. When play
  restarts, Reijnders, who is everywhere, wins a corner for City down the right.
  From which … 41 min: Another Wolves player takes an accidental whack to the
  head. This time it’s Munetsi, slapped by Stones as the pair contest a high
  ball. On come the physios again. 39 min: Well, that’s taken the air out of
  Molineux. Wolves were arguably looking the more likely to open the scoring ten
  minutes ago, but now look. What a double whammy. Agbadou gifts Bobb the ball
  in the centre circle with a loose pass. Bobb strides down the middle, draws
  the last man, and slips Reijnders free down the inside-left channel. Reijnders
  still has work to do, but from the edge of the box whistles a fierce
  daisycutter across Sa and into the bottom right! What a finish! 36 min:
  Haaland has now scored on the opening day of each of his four Premier League
  seasons. Just as Wolves were beginning to cause City a few headaches, as well.
  It’s yet another opening-day goal for Haaland. Reijenders sashays down the
  inside-right channel, evading a couple of challenges in style, before wedging
  a pass into the box for Lewis, who swivels and sends a pass across Sa and into
  the six-yard box. Haaland can’t miss the tap-in. 32 min: Silva dribbles
  dangerously down the right but having reached the box, is unable to tee up
  either Haaland or Gonzalez in the middle. A good response from City to a few
  uncertain minutes. 30 min: Suddenly, City are all over the shop at the back.
  Bellegarde glides in from the left and threads a diagonal cross-cum-shot
  towards Munetsi, who is free on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box! He
  slams a shot straight at Trafford, and Strand Larsen, rooted to the spot,
  fails to react to the rebound. He’d have had a tap-in otherwise. But the flag
  goes up for another offside on Munetsi. Some work needing to be done on the
  training ground regarding this. 28 min: Doherty wrestles Doku to the ground,
  having been gracefully spun. He should be booked, but the referee makes do
  with a stern word. A bit later in the match, in the season, and that would
  surely be a yellow. 26 min: Doherty crosses from a deep position on the right.
  Munetsi absolutely plants a header into the left-hand side of the net,
  Trafford given no chance. But the striker had mistimed his run, and was a good
  mile offside. It’s disallowed. That came seconds after Strand Larsen met
  Hoever’s right-wing cross only for his shot to be blocked. Wolves are also
  having a lot of joy down their right side. 24 min: … and then another pass
  down the right flank, this time releasing Munetsi, whose cross is met by the
  in-rushing Gomes. Met, but not controlled, and the ball bounces through to
  Trafford. A better touch, and Gomes was bursting through the middle and
  shooting, one on one with the keeper. Wolves beginning to bare some teeth. 23
  min: Agbadou sprays a long pass down the right and nearly releases Hoever, but
  Trafford races out of his box to head out for a throw. 21 min: Wolves move
  their press up a couple of notches, and get some joy with a series of 50-50s
  in the midfield. They come to nothing, but all of that is a demonstration of
  how City can be unsettled. 19 min: The number 18 clicks round on the stadium
  clock, and a huge ovation erupts in honour of Wolves’ former number 18, Diogo
  Jota. On the field, one great striker nearly honours another, as Silva crosses
  from the left, Haaland heading over an unguarded net – Sa was on walkabout –
  from six yards. To be fair to Haaland, the cross was too high and a little bit
  behind him. 18 min: Bobb jinks his way down the right, drawing three defenders
  before reaching the byline and pulling back to Lewis, who scuttles into the
  box on the underlap. Lewis wins a corner that’s cleared without too much
  drama. City are getting a fair bit of joy down this right side. 16 min: Silva
  is thankfully back up and about, and cleared to play on. 15 min: In going for
  that header, Gonzalez accidentally clattered into Andre, who took a whack on
  the side of the head. He goes down slowly, looking pretty groggy it has to be
  said. On comes the physio to gently assess the situation. 13 min: Stones
  crosses from the right again. It’s half cleared to Gonzalez, who heads back
  towards goal from the edge of the box. Sa does well to gather a ball
  threatening to sneak into the bottom-left corner. 11 min: Reijnders is already
  making his presence felt in the City midfield. A strong run down the middle
  nearly launches an attack out of nothing, challenges bouncing off him. He’s
  going to be some player for City. 9 min: Toti slips and nearly lets Haaland
  scoot clear down the middle. But as the defender falls, the ball hits his arm,
  stopping it getting through to the striker. It’s accidental, though, and it’s
  injury added to insult for City as Reijnders and Silva launch a pincer-move on
  Joao Gomes, and are about to tear clear themselves when the referee pulls them
  up for a soft foul. Wolves get away with not one, but two. 7 min: Stones
  crosses from a deep position on the right. He floats a diagonal towards Doku,
  whose run has sprung him clear of the City back line. He’s free in the box,
  albeit facing a tight angle; however he can’t control the dropping ball and
  it’s a goal kick. 6 min: Dias plays a careless pass out from the back which is
  snapped up by Andre. The ball’s shifted left to Bellegarde, who looks for
  Strand Larsen in the middle with a low cross. Dias makes up for his mistake by
  sliding in front of the Wolves striker to block and hook clear. Better from
  Wolves, which wasn’t a high bar: they’d previously hardly had a touch. 4 min:
  City have settled quickly. They’re already dominating possession. Bobb slips
  Reijnders into space on the right but the £34m signing from Milan runs the
  ball out for a goal kick. 2 min: Doku scampers down the left and crosses deep.
  Haaland is lurking, so Moller Wolfe is taking no chances, and heads behind for
  the first corner of the match. Silva swings it in, but it’s cleared easily
  enough. City get the ball rolling. It’s passed back immediately to Trafford,
  who gets his first touch in a competitive fixture for his new club by
  blootering upfield. Agbadou heads it back the other way. The teams are out.
  Wolves in their old gold, City their sky blue. Sting’s Fields of Gold,
  favourite of Diogo Jota, plays over the PA system. Very many emotional faces
  in the stands. A tifo is unveiled: “We’ll remember you when you walk in Fields
  of Gold.” The players congregate around the centre circle for a moment of
  thunderous applause in his memory. The crowd also chant his name. The
  Portuguese flag flutters high over Molineux. Then the referee’s whistle,
  signalling the match about to be played. Pep Guardiola speaks to Sky. “We
  always try to anticipate what is going to happen … I don’t know … the team is
  training good since the Club World Cup … they came back from their short
  holidays good … training sessions are good … now they try to win games … it’s
  the first game of the season … this is my tenth season … we will try to be as
  consistent as possible … the key months will be November, December, January
  and February.” He also reports that Ederson is ill with a stomach bug – so put
  that Galatasaray chat on hold – and that Rodri will be available again “very
  soon”. Wolves boss Vítor Pereira talks to Sky Sports. “We have to compete from
  the first game … this is a tough competition … we need to start to get points
  from the beginning … today is not a time to complain about what is missing [re
  the departures of Rayan Aït-Nouri and Matheus Cunha] … it is time to think
  about ourselves, our players, we have a very good group … we compete for sure
  … I want to see bravery … tactical organisation … true spirit … good energy
  for the supporters … my focus is not in the players that leave but the players
  I have in this moment.” The cover of today’s matchday programme is a study of
  Diogo Jota in the Old Gold of Wolves and the red and green of Portugal. His
  brother André Silva is draped in Portuguese finery on the back. Supporters
  meanwhile congregate outside Molineux next to a mural depicting Jota. Glasses
  are raised to their old number 18; sweet memories of the 2017-18 Championship
  win, and the reflected glory of Jota’s 2024-25 Nations League triumph.
  Wolverhampton Wanderers had a debut to Norway left wing-back David Møller
  Wolfe. Their other new signings – Colombia striker Jhon Arias and young
  Spanish midfielder Fer López – are both named as subs. Manchester City give a
  debut to James Trafford, with Ederson omitted entirely. Ederson is rumoured to
  be leaving, possibly in a £10m deal with Galatasaray. Rayan Ait-Nouri,
  formerly of Wolves, and Tijjani Reijnders make their Premier League debuts for
  City, having already turned out for their new employers at the Club World Cup.
  Wolverhampton Wanderers: Jose Sa, Doherty, Agbadou, Toti Gomes, Hoever, Joao
  Gomes, Andre Trindade, Wolfe, Bellegarde, Larsen, Munetsi. Subs: Johnstone,
  Hugo Bueno, Santiago Bueno, Arias, Hwang, Mosquera, Kalajdzic, Rodrigo Gomes,
  Lopez. Manchester City: Trafford, Lewis, Stones, Dias, Ait Nouri, Gonzalez,
  Reijnders, Bobb, Silva, Doku, Haaland. Subs: Ortega, Ake, Marmoush, Cherki,
  Gundogan, Akanji, Matheus Luiz, O’Reilly, Khusanov. Referee: Jarred Gillett
  (Australia). Wolverhampton Wanderers start their season under a cloud. Diogo
  Jota was a Liverpool player when he passed, but he was beloved of Wolves too,
  having won promotion with the Old Gold before helping them re-establish
  themselves as a top-flight presence. He scored 44 goals in 131 appearances for
  the Molineux club, an extremely popular figure. Wreaths will be laid, a tifo
  unveiled, and Jota’s favourite song, the unquestionably appropriate Fields Of
  Gold by Sting, will be performed. Then a game of football will take place.
  Kick-off will be at 5.30pm UK time.

Is he for the off? “The club will inform me … I don’t know anything.” Wolves weren’t completely toothless this evening.

West Ham are next on it, having been on the end of his absurd talent nine times. 63 min: Strand Larsen and Lewis point, paw and bicker at each other awhile. The referee tells them both to stop playing silly buggers. This is an absolutely wonderful goal. Trafford launches a long pass down the right. Reijnders takes it down from the sky with a cushioned touch. He one-twos down the inside-right channel with Bobb, enters the box, then cuts back for Haaland, who smacks a low shot across Sa and into the bottom left. Sa might have got a stronger hand to it, but nevertheless, what a move, what a team goal. What a player Reijnders is! 59 min: A free kick for Wolves out on the right. With everyone lined up on the edge of the box, awaiting the cross, Bellegarde surprises everyone except Strand Larsen by slipping a cute pass down the inside-right channel. Strand Larsen doesn’t quite catch his shot properly, but it balloons up, forcing Trafford to tip over. Nothing comes of the resulting corner, but the last few minutes have given Wolves a little bit of hope as they search for the goal that would get them back into the game. 57 min: Munetsi makes bueno down the right and fizzes a low ball through the City six-yard box. There’s nobody there in Old Gold to poke home. 56 min: Doku chases after a long pass in the hope of breaking clear on goal. But the whistle goes, because the opportunity only arose after Haaland had smacked into Toti. 54 min: Bellegarde nips in ahead of Reijnders in the centre circle. He’s got Moller Wolfe in space on the left, and a counter-attack is on. So Reijnders takes one for the team, cynically nudging him from behind. A yellow card to go with his goal and assist-to-the-assist for the opener. 52 min: Strand Larsen returns. With little else going on, Pat Collins peruses the team-sheets downpage in the MBM. “At least Vitor Pereira can turn to his bench with a look of deep consideration on his face and exclaim ‘Oh! Good-Good!’,” he quips, before having the decency to apologise in lower case. “sorry” 50 min: Strand Larsen requires some treatment after clashing knees with Ait-Nouri. He looks in some pain. He eventually gets up and hobbles to the touchline, though he needs more time. Wolves down to ten for the moment. 48 min: Hoever, on the right, plays a glorious first-time crossfield pass towards Moller Wolfe, who would have been clear on goal had he controlled. Reader, he did not control. A fine opportunity flies out of play. What vision from Hoever, though. 46 min: Almost a perfect start to the half for Wolves, as Doherty rolls a long pass down the right for Hoever, whose low cross finds Strand Larsen, ten yards out. Strand Larsen looks to guide a shot into the bottom right, but his effort whistles inches wide. Trafford might have had it covered; he might not. Wolves get the second half started. No changes. Half-time postbag. “Contrary to what you might see in the Canadian or Scandinavian tundra, Reijnders has absolutely terrorised Wolves” – Peter Oh “These headlines write themselves: Reijnders guides the slay” – Chiwode “I’m thinking back to famous Wolves-City clashes from the past, and those barrel-chested, fag-smoking greats Mike Bailey and Franny Lee. Barrel chests are sadly a thing of the past in these nutrition-specialist, controlled-diet days” – Jeremy Boyce “Is it true that the pea in Jarred Gillett’s whistle is the only one in the Premier League to rotate in a clockwise direction?” – Justin Kavanagh That’s why they’re champions a good shout to become champions for the seventh time in nine seasons. 45 min +4: Reijnders wins a corner down the right. Silva hits it long. Haaland flicks it on to Doku, whose bodyshape, mid-jump, is all wrong to either control or shoot from close range. Doku might have anticipated that flick-on better. That perhaps should have been 0-3. 45 min +2: Lewis attempts to shepherd a ball out for a goal kick, but he’s hassled from behind by Munetsi and is forced into conceding a corner. He claims to have been illegally skittled from behind, and he’s got a point, but the referee’s not buying it. The resulting corner nearly leads to a chance, too, as it’s hit long for Gomes, who can’t quite get a shot away on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. His eventual dinked cross is plucked from the sky by Trafford. 45 min +1: Hoever curls a cross in from the right. Strand Larsen attempts to sweep home from the penalty spot, but he’s half-falling and gets the job all wrong. Trafford claims. The flag would have gone up for offside anyway. 45 min: Bad news for Wolves: there will be five additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Silva takes that corner. Dias wins a header. Haaland competes for another. The ball’s half-cleared. Doku performs a cute back-heel on the right touchline. This particular period of pressure eventually comes to nothing, but Wolves could do with hearing the half-time whistle. They were looking good for a brief moment or two, but now they’re chasing shadows. 43 min: … City win a corner out on the left, a result of Doku’s twisting and turning. 42 min: Munetsi is OK to continue. When play restarts, Reijnders, who is everywhere, wins a corner for City down the right. From which … 41 min: Another Wolves player takes an accidental whack to the head. This time it’s Munetsi, slapped by Stones as the pair contest a high ball. On come the physios again. 39 min: Well, that’s taken the air out of Molineux. Wolves were arguably looking the more likely to open the scoring ten minutes ago, but now look. What a double whammy. Agbadou gifts Bobb the ball in the centre circle with a loose pass. Bobb strides down the middle, draws the last man, and slips Reijnders free down the inside-left channel. Reijnders still has work to do, but from the edge of the box whistles a fierce daisycutter across Sa and into the bottom right! What a finish! 36 min: Haaland has now scored on the opening day of each of his four Premier League seasons. Just as Wolves were beginning to cause City a few headaches, as well. It’s yet another opening-day goal for Haaland. Reijenders sashays down the inside-right channel, evading a couple of challenges in style, before wedging a pass into the box for Lewis, who swivels and sends a pass across Sa and into the six-yard box. Haaland can’t miss the tap-in. 32 min: Silva dribbles dangerously down the right but having reached the box, is unable to tee up either Haaland or Gonzalez in the middle. A good response from City to a few uncertain minutes. 30 min: Suddenly, City are all over the shop at the back. Bellegarde glides in from the left and threads a diagonal cross-cum-shot towards Munetsi, who is free on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box! He slams a shot straight at Trafford, and Strand Larsen, rooted to the spot, fails to react to the rebound. He’d have had a tap-in otherwise. But the flag goes up for another offside on Munetsi. Some work needing to be done on the training ground regarding this. 28 min: Doherty wrestles Doku to the ground, having been gracefully spun. He should be booked, but the referee makes do with a stern word. A bit later in the match, in the season, and that would surely be a yellow. 26 min: Doherty crosses from a deep position on the right. Munetsi absolutely plants a header into the left-hand side of the net, Trafford given no chance. But the striker had mistimed his run, and was a good mile offside. It’s disallowed. That came seconds after Strand Larsen met Hoever’s right-wing cross only for his shot to be blocked. Wolves are also having a lot of joy down their right side. 24 min: … and then another pass down the right flank, this time releasing Munetsi, whose cross is met by the in-rushing Gomes. Met, but not controlled, and the ball bounces through to Trafford. A better touch, and Gomes was bursting through the middle and shooting, one on one with the keeper. Wolves beginning to bare some teeth. 23 min: Agbadou sprays a long pass down the right and nearly releases Hoever, but Trafford races out of his box to head out for a throw. 21 min: Wolves move their press up a couple of notches, and get some joy with a series of 50-50s in the midfield. They come to nothing, but all of that is a demonstration of how City can be unsettled. 19 min: The number 18 clicks round on the stadium clock, and a huge ovation erupts in honour of Wolves’ former number 18, Diogo Jota. On the field, one great striker nearly honours another, as Silva crosses from the left, Haaland heading over an unguarded net – Sa was on walkabout – from six yards. To be fair to Haaland, the cross was too high and a little bit behind him. 18 min: Bobb jinks his way down the right, drawing three defenders before reaching the byline and pulling back to Lewis, who scuttles into the box on the underlap. Lewis wins a corner that’s cleared without too much drama. City are getting a fair bit of joy down this right side. 16 min: Silva is thankfully back up and about, and cleared to play on. 15 min: In going for that header, Gonzalez accidentally clattered into Andre, who took a whack on the side of the head. He goes down slowly, looking pretty groggy it has to be said. On comes the physio to gently assess the situation. 13 min: Stones crosses from the right again. It’s half cleared to Gonzalez, who heads back towards goal from the edge of the box. Sa does well to gather a ball threatening to sneak into the bottom-left corner. 11 min: Reijnders is already making his presence felt in the City midfield. A strong run down the middle nearly launches an attack out of nothing, challenges bouncing off him. He’s going to be some player for City. 9 min: Toti slips and nearly lets Haaland scoot clear down the middle. But as the defender falls, the ball hits his arm, stopping it getting through to the striker. It’s accidental, though, and it’s injury added to insult for City as Reijnders and Silva launch a pincer-move on Joao Gomes, and are about to tear clear themselves when the referee pulls them up for a soft foul. Wolves get away with not one, but two. 7 min: Stones crosses from a deep position on the right. He floats a diagonal towards Doku, whose run has sprung him clear of the City back line. He’s free in the box, albeit facing a tight angle; however he can’t control the dropping ball and it’s a goal kick. 6 min: Dias plays a careless pass out from the back which is snapped up by Andre. The ball’s shifted left to Bellegarde, who looks for Strand Larsen in the middle with a low cross. Dias makes up for his mistake by sliding in front of the Wolves striker to block and hook clear. Better from Wolves, which wasn’t a high bar: they’d previously hardly had a touch. 4 min: City have settled quickly. They’re already dominating possession. Bobb slips Reijnders into space on the right but the £34m signing from Milan runs the ball out for a goal kick. 2 min: Doku scampers down the left and crosses deep. Haaland is lurking, so Moller Wolfe is taking no chances, and heads behind for the first corner of the match. Silva swings it in, but it’s cleared easily enough. City get the ball rolling. It’s passed back immediately to Trafford, who gets his first touch in a competitive fixture for his new club by blootering upfield. Agbadou heads it back the other way. The teams are out. Wolves in their old gold, City their sky blue. Sting’s Fields of Gold, favourite of Diogo Jota, plays over the PA system. Very many emotional faces in the stands. A tifo is unveiled: “We’ll remember you when you walk in Fields of Gold.” The players congregate around the centre circle for a moment of thunderous applause in his memory. The crowd also chant his name. The Portuguese flag flutters high over Molineux. Then the referee’s whistle, signalling the match about to be played. Pep Guardiola speaks to Sky. “We always try to anticipate what is going to happen … I don’t know … the team is training good since the Club World Cup … they came back from their short holidays good … training sessions are good … now they try to win games … it’s the first game of the season … this is my tenth season … we will try to be as consistent as possible … the key months will be November, December, January and February.” He also reports that Ederson is ill with a stomach bug – so put that Galatasaray chat on hold – and that Rodri will be available again “very soon”. Wolves boss Vítor Pereira talks to Sky Sports. “We have to compete from the first game … this is a tough competition … we need to start to get points from the beginning … today is not a time to complain about what is missing [re the departures of Rayan Aït-Nouri and Matheus Cunha] … it is time to think about ourselves, our players, we have a very good group … we compete for sure … I want to see bravery … tactical organisation … true spirit … good energy for the supporters … my focus is not in the players that leave but the players I have in this moment.” The cover of today’s matchday programme is a study of Diogo Jota in the Old Gold of Wolves and the red and green of Portugal. His brother André Silva is draped in Portuguese finery on the back. Supporters meanwhile congregate outside Molineux next to a mural depicting Jota. Glasses are raised to their old number 18; sweet memories of the 2017-18 Championship win, and the reflected glory of Jota’s 2024-25 Nations League triumph. Wolverhampton Wanderers had a debut to Norway left wing-back David Møller Wolfe. Their other new signings – Colombia striker Jhon Arias and young Spanish midfielder Fer López – are both named as subs. Manchester City give a debut to James Trafford, with Ederson omitted entirely. Ederson is rumoured to be leaving, possibly in a £10m deal with Galatasaray. Rayan Ait-Nouri, formerly of Wolves, and Tijjani Reijnders make their Premier League debuts for City, having already turned out for their new employers at the Club World Cup. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Jose Sa, Doherty, Agbadou, Toti Gomes, Hoever, Joao Gomes, Andre Trindade, Wolfe, Bellegarde, Larsen, Munetsi. Subs: Johnstone, Hugo Bueno, Santiago Bueno, Arias, Hwang, Mosquera, Kalajdzic, Rodrigo Gomes, Lopez. Manchester City: Trafford, Lewis, Stones, Dias, Ait Nouri, Gonzalez, Reijnders, Bobb, Silva, Doku, Haaland. Subs: Ortega, Ake, Marmoush, Cherki, Gundogan, Akanji, Matheus Luiz, O’Reilly, Khusanov. Referee: Jarred Gillett (Australia). Wolverhampton Wanderers start their season under a cloud. Diogo Jota was a Liverpool player when he passed, but he was beloved of Wolves too, having won promotion with the Old Gold before helping them re-establish themselves as a top-flight presence. He scored 44 goals in 131 appearances for the Molineux club, an extremely popular figure. Wreaths will be laid, a tifo unveiled, and Jota’s favourite song, the unquestionably appropriate Fields Of Gold by Sting, will be performed. Then a game of football will take place. Kick-off will be at 5.30pm UK time.
