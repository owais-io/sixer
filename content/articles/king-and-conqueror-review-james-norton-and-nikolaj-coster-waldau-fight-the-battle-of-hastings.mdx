  It is 1066. We are on a battlefield in black and white. Colour has yet to be
  invented. “William!” shouts the leader of one army. “Harold!” shouts the
  leader of the other, creating a Proustian rush of Madge Bishop roaring across
  Ramsay Street at her husband during the glory days of Neighbours. But I wonder
  what happens next? History, that’s what! But to explain the history that is
  about to happen we must first go back a bit to, a caption informs us, “years
  earlier”. This is a little after “bygone times”, a bit before “days of yore”
  and, as it appears that Edward the Confessor (Eddie Marsan, having the time of
  his life playing the last monarch of the house of Wessex as a religious
  fanatic) is about to be crowned, probably around 1043. They can’t say that,
  though, because then people who know their Harolds from their Haralds, instead
  of just wanting to make jokes about Cnuts and Harthacnuts, will start getting
  upset about tweaked timelines. As if an eight-part drama from the BBC with CBS
  is the right place to be looking for detailed understanding of the reshaping
  of English society the like of which has never been seen before or since, but
  anyway, on we go! Colour has been invented, by the way. Apparently, it was
  just a stylistic choice before. On one side of the Channel lives William
  (“William!”), Duke of Normandy. He is played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau
  (sister-botherer Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) and very well, too,
  despite the decision to have him sport a tiny bristly moustache that makes him
  look like a 1970s Everydad. Each time we cut across La Manche, I expect to see
  him herding kids into a Vauxhall Cavalier to get back to the ferry in time.
  But, instead, he is being summoned across the water to attend Eddie
  Confessor/Marsan’s coronation because they are first cousins once removed. He
  is reluctant because weddings of distant relatives are always so boring –
  though, as it turns out, that is the least of the problems this particular
  genetic link is going to bring about. But off he trots. On the other side of
  the Channel lives Harold (“Harold!”), son of Godwin, Earl of Wessex (Geoff
  Bell), brother-in-law to Marsan the Confessor (claim to the throne ahoy!),
  father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife … no, wait, I’ve got my
  history streams crossed. Go back. Stop after “ahoy!”. OK. He is played by
  James Norton who, cast essentially as the goodie to Coster-Waldau’s relative
  baddie, does not have much of interest to do though he gamely gives his best
  throughout. King and Conqueror starts slowly and never quite attains escape
  velocity. Like William confronted with Anglo-Saxon troublemakers when he first
  lands in England, you have to fight your way through a couple of
  exposition-heavy episodes before the narrative starts flowing with anything
  like freedom. This is because the BBC/CBS are aware that, unlike the Tudor
  period or days of yore, the general public does not have much working
  knowledge of the era. So, people say things like: “Everything is changing …
  this is a new age. That’s how important the coronation of someone who is not
  yet known as Edward the Confessor, but will be, is.” The meat of the thing
  comprises machinations and shenanigans mostly courtesy of Ed’s formidable
  mother Lady Emma, formidably played by Juliet Stevenson, and King Henry of
  France (Jean-Marc Barr). Alliances, treacheries, sudden sons and heirs,
  interfering Mercians and Counts of Flanders abound, along with some
  semi-decent parts for the women playing the prime movers’ wives and sisters.
  Clémence Poésy brings striking grit to Matilda, the always brilliant Clare
  Holman gives us Wessex matriarch Gytha (rightly infuriated by every member of
  her clan as time goes on), and Emma Beecham provides a flinty Edith. Whether
  this is commercial ahistorical necessity, woke madness or a return to a truth
  obscured by centuries of revisionism by the patriarchy, I leave you to discuss
  animatedly among yourselves. Eventually, eight hours later, we are back on the
  battlefield, in colour this time. No spoilers but anyone hoping for a sequel
  starring James Norton as a happily retired earl-king, perhaps solving cosy
  crimes in a tranquil hamlet west of Lundenwic (London) that nevertheless has a
  murder rate comparable to 80s Detroit, is doomed to disappointment. Especially
  if they want him to have two eyes while doing it. You do feel those eight
  hours, though. King and Conqueror clearly aims to be a ripping yarn. It is not
  intended to labour points about power, corruption, sacrifice and venality
  despite their acute relevance. But it hangs a little too heavy. An earnest
  undertow runs throughout and prevents it ever becoming the combustible fun it
  could be. A failure to conquer, you might say. • King and Conqueror aired on
  BBC One and is on iPlayer now.
