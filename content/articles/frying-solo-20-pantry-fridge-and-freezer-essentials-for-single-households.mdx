  A decade ago I put together a Running Away from Home Cookbook as a gentle
  nudge to one of my millennial chicks. Too gentle as it turned out – 10 years
  later I was the one who left home. After a lifetime of cooking for the
  multitudes, I have adapted to cooking for one. It’s been both a relief and a
  revelation. Single householders aged 65 and over are increasing as a
  proportion of the population. I am one of that large cohort. Whatever the
  circumstances, people living solo – whether alone or in a share house – can
  eat well and inexpensively. By making the most of whatever pantry, fridge and
  freezer space is at your disposal, you can prepare something nutritious and
  delicious. Limited bench, cooktop and oven space can still produce the best
  kind of fast food. The fewer ingredients and steps, the less kitchen real
  estate and hardware required. What follows are cook-to-survive recipes, with
  pantry items that speed up the process, such as ready-to-use minced ginger,
  crushed garlic and microwaveable rice. Pick and choose accordingly. Sign up
  for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the
  weekend, every Saturday morning Pantry essentials Oil Olives Good quality
  anchovies Vinegar Tinned tomatoes Coconut cream Tinned tuna Chickpeas Dukkah
  Pasta, noodles and rice Olive oil is the oil of choice if pasta is your go-to
  cupboard meal. Light olive oil has a higher smoke point than extra-virgin
  olive oil and can be used in cooking and for dressings. Nut and sesame oils
  have a more limited shelf life and are generally used in smaller quantities,
  so buy small and check the use-by date regularly. The oil from marinated
  olives or cheeses can be used to make Swedish crispbread, in dressings or
  drizzled over roasted vegetables for antipasto. Good-quality anchovies are
  more subtle in taste than their less expensive cousins and are the foundation
  for an excellent pasta sauce when mixed with oil, lemon, garlic, rosemary and
  any other fresh herbs. Add them as a tuna alternative to leftover steamed or
  baked potatoes, tomatoes (chopped or cherry), boiled eggs, black olives, green
  beans and capsicums with a drizzle of oil and vinegar for a delicious salade
  niçoise. If tinned, in glass or in a vacuum-sealed pack, any leftover
  anchovies can be divided up and frozen in usable quantities. Balsamic vinegar
  can be used on its own or combined with oil to dress salads and roast
  vegetables. Rice wine vinegar is used extensively in Asian cooking, and can be
  used at a pinch as a substitute for white, white wine and apple cider
  vinegars. Tinned chickpeas and diced or pureed tomatoes are great for soups
  and curries. Any leftover tomato can be microwaved (lid on) in five-minute
  bursts to reduce and thicken to make a great pizza base either on its own or
  combined with fresh herbs or pesto. Dukkah, a spicy mix of cumin, coriander,
  almonds and sesame seeds, is an essential weapon in my cooking armoury. Try
  dipping some good bread first in a pot of good olive oil, then in a pot of
  dukkah. Or split round pita bread in half, brush or spray with olive oil and
  sprinkle dukkah generously over the top, then bake in a 180C oven until golden
  brown and crispy. Serve warm or allow to cool and seal in an airtight
  container. It will last for up to a week. I use coconut cream powder as a
  space-efficient alternative to the tinned version. When mixed with water, or
  the hot liquid from whatever you’re cooking, it doubles as a thickener so you
  get all the coconut flavour you want without watering down the sauce. Pasta,
  noodles and rice are must-have items in my pantry. I prefer the old-fashioned
  environment-friendly absorption method of cooking rice but have been known to
  keep a pouch or two of microwaveable rice handy for emergencies. Fridge
  essentials Minced ginger Roasted garlic Parmesan, grated or block Pesto
  Mayonnaise Stir-fry sauce To my taste buds, commercial minced ginger is an
  acceptable substitute for fresh and I love the added zing it gives a stir-fry.
  For those who don’t like the taste of commercial crushed garlic in a jar,
  roasted garlic is a delicious alternative that will keep for weeks in a sealed
  container in the fridge and can be squeezed out of their cloves as required.
  Whenever the oven is on, I throw in a whole garlic or two and leave it there
  for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the garlic cloves are soft and squishy.
  I’m a fan of freshly grated parmesan, but for the time poor, you can’t beat
  pre-grated commercial parmesan. A block can last for weeks if kept in sealed
  plastic in the fridge. I still haven’t found a commercial pesto that doesn’t
  have an unpleasant aftertaste so I make my own. I either bottle it in small
  jars and seal each with a top layer of oil to make it airtight, or freeze it
  in ice cube trays. With a space-saving mincing wand and any old combination of
  basil, garlic, toasted pine nuts and olive oil (with or without parmesan) a
  world of lightning-fast meals-for-one opens up to you. Try these pesto baked
  eggs for one. Give me a good-quality store-bought mayonnaise and I’ll show you
  a shortcut to happiness. Mix it with boiled eggs and a really good curry mix
  and lather it on excellent bread, with or without rocket. Or add some of that
  roasted garlic and serve it as aioli with leftover meat, seafood, roast
  vegetables, boiled eggs. Nagi Maehashi’s all-purpose stir-fry sauce is an
  absolute winner. It can be used in place of the chilli oil and sauce in Justin
  Tsang’s chilli oil udon and it can also be frozen into ice cube containers.
  Freezer essentials Homemade stock Frozen peas Lemon and lime juice ice cubes
  Pizza bases Whenever you cook a roast chicken, you have the potential for any
  number of soups, risottos and sauces. I keep leftover bones and skin in a
  sealed plastic bag in the fridge or freezer until I’m at home for the four
  hours it takes to turn them into stock. Add enough salted water to a pot to
  just cover them, add leftover carrot, celery and onion ends and simmer them –
  lid off – until the mixture reduces by half or until it reaches your preferred
  flavour intensity. Frozen peas can be thrown into the pasta pot for the final
  two minutes of cooking time. Drain then add a good dollop of oil and some
  pesto and grated parmesan from your fridge or freezer. A squeeze of lemon or
  lime is an essential feature of many pasta, noodle or salad dishes, so having
  frozen cubes of juice is handy for when you don’t want to slice into a whole
  fruit. If you have a pizza base, some pesto, reduced tomato puree and
  mozzarella is all you need for a delicious margherita. Try adding leftover
  ham, salami, olives or, if you fancy it, tandoori chicken slices for a truly
  delicious fast meal.
