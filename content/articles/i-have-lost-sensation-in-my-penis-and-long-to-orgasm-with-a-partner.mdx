  I am a 64-year-old single man and have had more than 30 sexual partners in the
  15 years since my divorce. However, I haven’t achieved orgasm by any means
  other than masturbation in years. It doesn’t matter what my partners try, I
  can’t climax, and I frequently fake orgasms because they get frustrated and I
  get tired. I was diagnosed with multifocal motor neuropathy several years ago,
  and my penile sensation is definitely diminished. Using a condom makes it
  worse, but I comply with a partner’s wishes for our protection. Even with
  masturbation and visual stimulation via pornography, it may take me more than
  30 minutes to have an orgasm. I know there is a lot to unpack here, but what
  do you suggest? There is way more to sex than a race to orgasm. You are smart
  and self-aware sexually, but you are failing to truly experience pleasure
  because you are now (understandably) goal-oriented and fearful. Many people
  subscribe to the idea there should be one particular pattern to lovemaking –
  usually the one that starts with a bit of “foreplay” and proceeds to the “main
  event” of orgasm. Stop thinking like this. Instead, focus on pure pleasure
  rather than on achieving a climax. Consider the possibility that foreplay is
  overall a more erotic and pleasurable main event and that orgasmic ecstasy is
  a very brief, not altogether necessary, exclamation mark at the end. An
  enormous amount of prolonged pleasure awaits you and your partner if you can
  approach sexual encounters in this way and be honest about what works for you
  and what doesn’t. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who
  specialises in treating sexual disorders. If you would like advice from Pamela
  on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to
  private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments). Each week,
  Pamela chooses one problem to answer, which will be published online. She
  regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence. Submissions are
