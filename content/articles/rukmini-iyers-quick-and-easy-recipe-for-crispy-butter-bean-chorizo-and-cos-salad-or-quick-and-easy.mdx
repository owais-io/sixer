  I was thinking of billing this as a caesar salad with an extreme makeover. One
  night, I started making a caesar salad, then wondered what would happen if I
  made a coriander-pesto mayonnaise and mugged off the anchovies in favour of
  chorizo. Then I thought about turning it into a full meal, at which point it
  stopped being anything like a caesar salad. If you’d prefer a vegetarian
  version, choose a vegetarian parmesan and omit the chorizo in favour of a
  heaped teaspoon of smoked paprika and a scant teaspoon of sea salt flakes.
  Crispy butter bean, chorizo and cos salad with coriander Prep 15 min Cook 25
  min Serves 2 50ml olive oil, plus 1 tbsp for roasting 100g chorizo, cut into
  1cm chunks 400g tin butter beans, drained and rinsed well 150g Tenderstem
  broccoli, cut into 1cm pieces 50g fresh coriander, leaves and stems 20g
  parmesan, or vegetarian parmesan 25g pumpkin seeds 1 egg yolk Juice of ½ lemon
  1 tsp salt 2 little gem lettuce, roughly shredded Heat the oven to 200C (180C
  fan)/390F/gas 6. Put a tablespoon of olive oil, the chorizo and drained butter
  beans in a shallow baking tray and mix well. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until
  the beans start to crisp up nicely. Meanwhile, blanch the Tenderstem in a bowl
  of just-boiled water for two minutes, then drain well. For the dressing, put
  the coriander, parmesan, pumpkin seeds, 50ml olive oil, egg yolk, lemon juice
  and salt in a high-speed blender and blitz to a smoothish, pale green sauce:
  it should be almost as thick as mayonnaise, but with a little more texture.
  Taste and adjust the salt and lemon as needed. Just before you want to eat,
  tip the shredded lettuce into a large bowl and add the broccoli. Dress with a
  third of the dressing, then divide between two plates. Dot over the remaining
  dressing, scatter the butter bean and chorizo mix on top, and serve
  immediately.
