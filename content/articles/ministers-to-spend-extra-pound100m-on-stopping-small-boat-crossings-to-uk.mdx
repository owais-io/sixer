  Ministers will spend an extra £100m on measures to deter Channel crossings,
  including on the planned “one in, one out” returns agreement with France, the
  Home Office has said. In a third immigration policy pledge within 24 hours,
  the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the money would pay for up to 300 more
  National Crime Agency officers, as well as new technology and equipment to
  step up intelligence-gathering on people-smuggling gangs. For seven years,
  successive governments have tried and failed to stop people crossing the
  Channel in small boats. Figures released last week showed more than 25,000
  people had arrived in the UK via small boats in 2025 so far, a record for this
  point in the year. Protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers spread this
  weekend. Nine people were arrested on Saturday in Islington, north London,
  after brief clashes between protesters and counter-protesters outside the
  Thistle City Barbican hotel. On Sunday afternoon, more than 100 people, many
  of them women wearing pink T-shirts, gathered outside the Britannia
  International hotel in Canary Wharf after reports that asylum seekers had been
  bussed in under the cover of darkness. Grainy footage on social media appeared
  to show men getting off a coach and being escorted into the hotel in the early
  hours. A group of men wearing face masks were also seen outside the Britannia
  hotel later in the afternoon. Chants of “send them home” broke out. Protesters
  jeered at people going in and out of the hotel, and officers were forced to
  step in after flares were let off in the crowd, the Metropolitan police said.
  A group of people were “harassing occupants and staff” and trying to prevent
  deliveries being made, the force added. They were also trying to “breach the
  fencing and access the hotel”. One man had been arrested in Canary Wharf “on
  suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker” after an officer was pushed,
  police said. Fresh protests had erupted on Thursday outside a hotel in Epping,
  Essex – the latest in a series of demonstrations after an Ethiopian asylum
  seeker was charged with sexual assault against a local girl. The “one in, one
  out” deal agreed with France last month means the government will for the
  first time be able to send people back there in exchange for asylum seekers
  with links to Britain. The scheme is uncertain in scale and timing – critics
  have claimed it will not be a deterrent because it will only result in the
  exchange of up to 50 people each week. In a statement, Cooper said the
  additional funding would “turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement
  agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners
  overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment. “Alongside our
  new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward our plan for
  change commitments to protect the UK’s border security and restore order to
  our immigration system.” In a separate development, academics at the
  University of Oxford have concluded that £20bn has been spent on
  “migrant-welcoming schemes”, including asylum accommodation, over 10 years,
  but with little focus on integration and community cohesion. A team from the
  Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (Compas) said the money from 26
  different spending streams over the decade to April 2024 included a £10bn
  overspend on asylum accommodation, while only “small amounts of money” had
  been spent on long-term goals such as community consent. Jacqueline Broadhead,
  a senior researcher at Compas, said the government had an opportunity to
  redress the balance. “While there have been very high levels of overspend on
  asylum hotels, there has not been equivalent investment on cohesion and
  integration, which could help mitigate some of the pressures on local
  communities,” she said. On Saturday, the government released plans to
  introduce a new offence for advertising irregular small boat crossings under
  the border security, asylum and immigration bill going through parliament.
  Assisting illegal immigration to the UK is already a crime. Officials believe
  the offence would give police and other agencies more power to disrupt
  criminal gangs. And in yet another announcement on Saturday, Cooper said she
  planned to introduce a fast-track scheme to tackle the asylum backlog, with
  the aim of turning around decisions within weeks. There are tens of thousands
  of refugees who have been waiting for longer than a year for an initial
  decision on their applications for asylum. More than seven in 10 are
  eventually granted permission to stay in the UK. The Conservatives criticised
  Cooper’s funding announcement as a “desperate grab for headlines, which will
  make no real difference”. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition, told
  Trevor Phillips on Sky News that Labour should revive Boris Johnson’s ditched
  £700m plan to send people to Rwanda, and should close the hotel in Epping.
  “What we need is a third-country deterrent so that people can be processed
  elsewhere,” she said.
