  A moment that changed me: on the day of my first book deal, a mysterious hum
  overcame me

  I developed tinnitus the same night I was offered my first book deal at the
  end of 2014. I’d received the news late-afternoon, then went out for cocktails
  with two friends to celebrate. I remember the evening well: we’d gone
  somewhere loud but not too loud; I ordered a fluorescent orange drink that I
  didn’t enjoy. Before I went to bed, I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone.
  “This could really change your life,” he said. Sometime in the early hours of
  the following morning, I woke up with a ringing in my ears that has not gone
  away since. Tinnitus often appears out of nowhere. Some describe it as like
  standing next to the engine of a plane, or caught within a colony of flying
  bats. The sound I woke with wasn’t so bad: a sort of midpoint between the hiss
  of television static and the roar of the ocean. At first I thought it must
  have been coming from my phone, which was usually inches away from my face as
  I slept. I then searched my room for malfunctioning electronics, before
  realising with bracing horror that the noise was coming from inside my brain.
  The condition can be divided into three categories: subjective tinnitus (the
  perception of sound where there is none); objective tinnitus (where there is a
  sound within or close to the ear that another person can sometimes hear); and
  somatic tinnitus, which worsens with body movement. Mine was the former: a
  phantom sound. Little is known about what causes it, but one theory is that
  loud sounds damage the hairs in the cochlea, flattening them like stems of
  corn after a storm. The hairs normally pick up sounds and, without them, the
  brain seeks out sounds from other parts of the ear, sending back signals that
  translate to a perpetual illusory hum. I’d spent many years going to loud
  concerts and playing drums in a band, only occasionally protecting my hearing
  with earplugs. I started to blame myself. The first few days felt long and
  hard. It seemed absurd to be so troubled by what is basically an annoying
  sound, but its inescapability and totality was maddening. The world was
  suddenly bifurcated into quiet spaces, in which I had nothing to mask the
  tinnitus, and loud spaces, which threatened to damage my hearing further. I
  couldn’t stop catastrophising: “I will never hear silence again. I will always
  be too distracted to write. I will be driven mad by loud sounds.” I became
  anxious and, like 21% of tinnitus patients, I developed suicidal thoughts. My
  GP was unsympathetic, telling me it would not go away but I would get used to
  it – and no, I couldn’t have any Valium. A few days before Christmas, I went
  to stay with my boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Ironically, there were
  copies of the Max Ehrmann poem Desiderata all over the house – printed off in
  the guest room, hanging beside the bathroom sink. It was one of his mum’s
  favourites; she identified strongly with the message: “Go placidly amid the
  noise … remember what peace there may be in silence.” I read online studies
  about tinnitus compulsively. I discovered advice to seek out quiet spaces in
  which I could place my hands over my ears to get a measure of whether it was
  getting any better or worse. But this only exacerbated my nerves. On New
  Year’s Day, I couldn’t stop crying; I felt stuck in an abject state of misery
  and panic. I began hypnotherapy, hoping I could trick my brain into not
  hearing the never-ending noise. My hypnotherapist told me this was not how it
  worked. Instead, she tried to teach me how to separate my feelings of anxiety
  from the sounds in my ears, and how to relax; sending me away with audio files
  of women whispering about the sea. I began sleeping to the sound of brown
  noise – named after “Brownian motion”, the random movement of particles in a
  liquid – replacing one hum with another. I practised progressive muscle
  relaxation, my antidepressants kicked in and I began the long process of
  habituation – learning to tune out the unwanted, unstoppable sound. Just over
  a month after I first developed tinnitus, I was on holiday in Brasov,
  Transylvania – a 30th-birthday present from my sister and mum. Towards the end
  of the trip, the three of us were walking through the mountains, and when I
  looked back I realised I couldn’t see either of them. I was surrounded only by
  recently settled snow. There was something about the white of the snow and the
  ringing in my ears that felt equivalent; blank and unintimidating, somehow.
  Tinnitus is often described as white noise, but white is achromatic – a colour
  that isn’t really a colour. I knew then that I’d make peace with this sound
  that isn’t really a sound, my new version of silence. That was a decade ago,
  and these days I’ve learned to accept and adjust. I’d railed so violently
  against my tinnitus, and achieved nothing. Now I acknowledge what I cannot
  change, and it doesn’t bother me at all. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans
