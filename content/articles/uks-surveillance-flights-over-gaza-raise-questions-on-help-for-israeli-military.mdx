  UK’s surveillance flights over Gaza raise questions on help for Israeli
  military

  Britain continues to run near daily surveillance flights over Gaza with the
  help of a US contractor at a time of growing questions about how the
  intelligence obtained is used and shared with the Israeli military. Specialist
  flight trackers estimate that RAF Shadow aircraft have run more than 600
  flights over the Palestinian territory from the Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus in
  an attempt to locate the remaining hostages held by Hamas since December 2023.
  Spy flights were started under the Conservatives but have continued under
  Labour with few details shared publicly, at a rate of about two a day at first
  but dropping to one a day more recently, specialist trackers said.
  Surveillance was transferred to a US contractor, Sierra Nevada Corporation, in
  late July to reduce costs and RAF sources indicated that it continues most
  days in an equivalent aircraft. But within days there was a mistake when the
  new spy plane was revealed to be circling over Khan Younis on 28 July. Until
  that time the spy planes’ transponders were turned off halfway into their
  flight from Akrotiri heading towards Gaza over the eastern Mediterranean. But
  the mistake meant that “the RAF (now contracted) flights could be confirmed
  over Gaza, not just adjacent to Gaza,” said the flight tracker and analyst
  Steffan Watkins. A subsequent tightening of security has made tracking flights
  more complicated, though on 3, 4, and 6 August the spy plane turned its
  transponders on and off before leaving Akrotiri, Watkins added. RAF Shadows
  are used for optical surveillance, day or night, often in support of SAS
  operations. One defence source said they were being “trained on individual
  buildings” in Gaza in an attempt to determine if there was any signs of life
  from the 20 hostages still thought to be alive. Jeremy Corbyn, the co-leader
  of an unnamed new left political party, said “the UK’s continued military
  cooperation with Israel is utterly indefensible” as “a genocide is
  livestreamed around the world”. The former Labour leader said: “We still don’t
  know why these flights are continuing and what intelligence is being
  provided.” Helen Maguire, the defence spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats,
  said while she supported UK efforts to locate the remaining hostages, “the
  government must outline what steps it has taken to ensure Israel can’t use
  UK-sourced intelligence for its military operations in Gaza”. The surveillance
  flights were first announced by the former defence secretary Grant Shapps in
  December 2023, in support of Israel, a country with a sophisticated
  intelligence operation of its own. No detail has been provided as to how the
  spy planes assisted Israel, which has rescued eight hostages since October
  2023. The UK government says it takes careful steps to control what it shares
  with Israel. Asked specifically about the surveillance flights last month, the
  foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “It would be quite wrong for the British
  government to assist in the prosecution of this war in Gaza. We are not doing
  that. I would never do that.” Military insiders said a normal process for
  sharing UK intelligence with Israel or another foreign country would include
  checks from a political adviser (a trained civil servant) and a lawyer in an
  exercise that one said could take “minutes, hours or days”. The British source
  added “why on earth would we want to get involved in a conflict where there
  are accusations of genocide and breaches of international humanitarian law?”
  while adding that if Richard Hermer, the attorney general, had raised serious
  concerns it would be unlikely the flights would continue. Passing on
  information of military utility to Israel would arguably make the UK a party
  to the ongoing war, though once passed over the use to which intelligence can
  be put by a third party cannot be completely controlled. The Labour
  backbencher Kim Johnson said it was “deeply concerning that surveillance
  flights over Gaza continue relentlessly, even as serious questions remain
  about their purpose and oversight – particularly when we’ve spent months
  demanding an end to the use of RAF Akrotiri to share intelligence with Israel
  during its genocidal onslaught on Gaza”. The Ministry of Defence did not
  comment, but indicated that it was conducting unarmed surveillance flights
  over Gaza for the purpose of locating hostages and that it controls what
  information is passed to Israeli authorities. The Attorney General’s Office
  said it did not comment on legal advice provided to other ministers.
