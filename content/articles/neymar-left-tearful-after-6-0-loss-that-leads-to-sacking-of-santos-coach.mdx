  An emotional Neymar said he was ashamed after his Santos side were on the end
  of a 6-0 home defeat by Vasco da Gama on Sunday, a humiliation that led to the
  sacking of their head coach, Cléber Xavier. Philippe Coutinho was on the
  scoresheet twice as Vasco found the net five times in 16 second-half minutes
  as part of a rout that leaves Santos two points above the relegation places in
  Brazil’s Serie A. At full-time, home supporters turned their backs to the
  pitch in the latest protest against the club. “I’m ashamed,” said Neymar, who
  was in tears as he left the pitch. “I’m totally disappointed with our
  performance. The fans have every right to protest, obviously without using
  violence. But if they want to curse and insult, they’re in their right. To sum
  up our attitude on the field, it was terrible. “I’ve never experienced this in
  my life. The tears were from anger, from everything. Unfortunately, I can’t
  help in every way.” Santos were relegated for the first time in their history
  in 2023 before returning to the top flight last season. They re-signed Neymar,
  who came through the ranks at the club before leaving for Barcelona in 2013,
  on a short-term contract in January. “It’s a shame to play like that wearing
  the Santos jersey,” Neymar said. “Everyone needs to lay their head on their
  pillow and think about what they want to do. Because with today’s attitude, if
  we do what we did on the field, I don’t think we even need to show up on
  Wednesday.” It was the biggest loss of Neymar’s career and was enough for
  Santos to sack Xavier, who took over in April in his first job as a head
  coach. The 61-year-old leaves Santos with 21 points from 19 games in Brazil’s
  top flight, with fellow battlers for survival Vasco two points behind them.
