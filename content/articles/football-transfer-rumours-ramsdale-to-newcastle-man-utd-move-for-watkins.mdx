  Given his current employers’ well-documented interest in securing the services
  of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace, Leandro Trossard is understandably
  reluctant to sign a contract extension with Arsenal until he has a better idea
  of how likely he is to get game time at the Emirates Stadium next season. The
  Belgian winger is the subject of interest from Borussia Dortmund, while at
  least two unnamed Premier League clubs are reported to have made “concrete
  offers”. Exactly how much concrete we’re talking about is unknown, but it
  seems Arsenal wouldn’t be adverse to cashing in on a player they bought from
  Brighton for £27m two years ago. Following a summer influx that isn’t
  necessarily over, the club are also believed to be open to offers for some or
  all of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus, Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr
  Zinchenko. The mass exodus of Bournemouth defenders shows no sign of abating,
  with Paris Saint-Germain apparently determined to lure Illia Zabarnyi to the
  French capital. A fan favourite who is regularly serenaded with a cleverly
  reworked chorus of Whitney Houston’s dancefloor filler I Wanna Dance With
  Somebody (Who Loves Me), the 22-year-old Ukrainian could join Milos Kerkez
  (Liverpool), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid) and Kepa Arrizabalaga (Arsenal via
  parent club Chelsea) in heading for the exit and is reported to have been the
  subject of an initial £50m bid from the Champions League winners, which
  Bournemouth have rejected. Tottenham have also been linked with a move for the
  centre-back. While Aaron Ramsdale may not be among the more glamorous targets
  to have been approached by Newcastle this summer, the Southampton goalkeeper
  does look to be on the verge of signing for Eddie Howe’s side, in a state of
  affairs that may prompt Manchester United to bid for his fellow England
  understudy Nick Pope. In the final year of his contract on Tyneside, the
  prospect of losing Pope is unlikely to get Newcastle fans as exercised as that
  of a certain in-demand and possibly Liverpool-bound Swedish striker, but the
  word from St James’ Park appears to be that Howe is bringing Ramsdale in to
  compete with, rather than replace his current first-choice keeper. Ollie
  Watkins is reported to be open to a move to Old Trafford but Aston Villa’s
  £60m valuation for the England striker is apparently too rich for Jim
  Ratcliffe’s blood. The Manchester United beancounters are hoping they can
  barter Villa down to a more palatable fee with their outcast winger Alejandro
  Garnacho thrown in to help grease the wheels of commercial progress. In other
  Villa news, Àlex Moreno could become a gentleman of Girona if the Spanish
  side’s manager Michel is successful in his bid to be reunited with a player he
  previously coached at Rayo Vallecano. Having spent last season on an
  underwhelming loan spell at Nottingham Forest, the 32-year-old is surplus to
  requirements at Villa Park and eager to leave. After his summer departure from
  Bayern Munich, Thomas Müller is MLS-bound and, despite interest from FC
  Cincinnati, looks likely to sign for Vancouver Whitecaps in a deal dependent
  on such romantic niceties as “targeted allocation money” and the successful
  negotiation of “discovery rights”. Set to become the Whitecaps’ most
  high-profile acquisition since one-time Brechin City Boys Club graduate Ryan
  Gauld, the German international will join a club that sits one point off top
  spot in the Western Conference with a game in hand over leaders San Diego.
