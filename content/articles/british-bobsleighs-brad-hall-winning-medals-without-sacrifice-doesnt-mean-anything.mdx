  anything’

  For most athletes, a loss of all funding would signal the end. But for Brad
  Hall, Team GB’s bobsleigh captain, it was the beginning of a remarkable
  comeback story. The 34-year-old speaks about the financial shakedown of
  British bobsleigh with remarkable calm, as if it was a hurdle most
  professionals faced. “I’ll have to take you back in time a little bit,” he
  says, reflecting on a period that could have ended his career. “We got a year
  of transitional funding until the 2019 world championships where we were told
  if we got top three we’re able to maintain our funding. But we finished
  fourth.” It was a moment that would redefine not just his career but the
  structure of British bobsleigh. In 2019 UK Sport withdrew funding for the
  programme, leaving the team in a precarious position. It led Hall, who found
  out in his bedroom from a news article, to take matters into his own hands,
  launching a crowdfunding campaign. The grassroots effort blossomed into Team
  Bobsleigh Brad, a self-funded entity operating with no official funding or
  support apart from private sponsors and donors. “It was very disappointing at
  the time, but it was the best thing for us because it allowed us to rebuild
  the programme until the 2022 Games where I was pretty much running everything
  myself,” Hall says of the Beijing Winter Olympics. “I was planning the season,
  the logistics, the athletes, the selection. It was very stressful going into
  those Games. “We finished sixth, which was disappointing at the time, but it
  was enough to bring back the UK Sport national lottery funding. That was key
  to our success in the following years. It allowed us to bring in coaches who
  could do most of the jobs I was doing beforehand so I could focus on my
  performances.” The return of funding sparked an unprecedented era of success
  for British bobsleigh. In 2023, Hall’s team clinched Britain’s first European
  four-man title and a four‑man world championship silver, the country’s first
  since 1939. Hall also secured Britain’s first two‑man World Cup medal in more
  than 30 years with a silver in Igls in January 2020. “The first year after the
  Olympics, we took off and won medals all over the place. We won three gold
  medals at the European championships, which had never been done before by a GB
  athlete, and we took that forward for the next few years.” This period of
  self-reliance transformed him as an athlete despite the added pressures.
  “Before we lost our funding I had a lot of ideas. I was like: ‘Why are we
  doing things this way?’ And every time I used to question management, my
  opinion wasn’t validated. It was like: ‘You don’t know what you’re talking
  about.’ But when we lost funding I was allowed to make these decisions and we
  saw improvement immediately. So I knew I was on to something.” Fostering a
  positive team culture was the first step, especially in a sport where
  individual performance is so visible. “It’s a lot to do with the athletes’
  selection in the first place. A lot are quite selfish, but they’ve got to
  understand this is a team sport. “As a pilot it’s a bit different because my
  position isn’t as threatened. Because I’m running the team, I’m always going
  to be selected. The brakemen’s heads were on the chopping board week-in and
  week-out. It’s very difficult to support your teammates when you know they
  could get the spot ahead of you. But if everyone’s helping, everyone gets
  better. “It’s trying to shift focus from we want to be the best on this team
  or the best in Great Britain to we want to be the best in the world.
  Competition’s out there, it’s not in here.” Team GB have their work cut out
  for them when it comes to competition, particularly from the dominant Germany
  team. Since the 1990s they have won more medals than any other country largely
  due to funding for their cutting-edge sleds made from high-strength,
  low-friction materials. The financial demands of the sport, which Germany can
  meet, are staggering: a world-class sled can cost between £25,000 and £70,000,
  with runners ranging from £4,000 to £10,000. “There’s three components to our
  performance,” Hall says. “The push start, the driving and our equipment. The
  equipment’s the one not in our power to change: you have a sled and sometimes
  you can improve it, sometimes you can’t. That’s why the German teams do so
  well. They’ve got money to pump into their research and development to improve
  things. We don’t have that. “But it pushes us. We don’t want to be at the top
  and not have any competition. Winning medals without the struggles and
  sacrifice to get them doesn’t mean anything. It feels like it’s given to you,
  which is sometimes what it looks like when the German teams win gold every
  week. It means even more to us because we shouldn’t realistically have a
  chance to be in that position.” Germany will be Team GB’s biggest threat at
  Milano Cortina 2026, where Hall hopes his team can elevate their Olympic
  performances to match their recent success. In Beijing, Hall finished sixth in
  the four-man and 11th in the two-man. At Pyeongchang 2018, he placed 17th in
  the open four and 12th in the two-man. “We try to downplay the Olympics and
  make it seem like it’s not anything special,” Hall says. “You’ve got to kind
  of de‑escalate the hype in some sort of way. You’ve got different banners and
  there’s a few more people watching, but you’ve got to focus on your job at
  hand.” The bobsleigh will be held at the redeveloped Eugenio Monti sliding
  centre in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a historic track built in the 1920s. It underwent
  a significant transformation with an investment of more than €118m (£103m),
  now featuring a 1,730m track with 16 curves, designed for speeds up to 140 kmh
  and an expected race time of 55-60 seconds. “I’ve been tracking Cortina. I
  haven’t driven it yet but I’ve seen videos,” Hall says. “It looks quite an
  easy track. It may just be down to the push and the equipment.” Regardless of
  the difficulty of the track, Hall’s vision for the perfect 2026 Games is
  clear: “Two medals, if not gold medals, around our necks. Simple.” It is an
  unsurprising declaration from an athlete who has already defied the odds –
  proving that even when funding dries up, the drive to be the best never does.
