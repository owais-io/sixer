  This bring our live coverage of the second Trump administration to a close for
  the day, but we will return on Thursday morning. Here are the latest
  developments: Donald Trump said that he plans to extend the federal takeover
  of the DC Metropolitan Police for more than the legally mandated 30 days. “I
  don’t want to call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the
  Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump
  said. Trump promised ‘very severe consequences’ if Vladimir Putin doesn’t
  agree to ceasefire at their Friday meeting in Alaska. He didn’t, however,
  elaborate on what those penalties will be. Trump took part in a virtual
  meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders ahead of his summit in
  Alaska with Putin which the German chancellor described as “constructive”.
  Zelenskyy confirmed that Trump said he would call him right after the meeting
  with Putin. At the Kennedy Center, Trump announced that he would host this
  year’s honors himself. California governor Gavin Newsom, who revels in
  trolling Trump on social media, used the president’s bizarre writing style to
  promote a news conference on his state’s plan to counter Texas gerrymandering,
  scheduled for Thursday at 11:30am Pacific Time. The White House announced that
  Trump revoked an executive order issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden, which
  made it government policy to promote competition throughout the US economy.
  Unlike many of Trump’s orders, this one, which ended 72 federal initiatives to
  fight corporate monopolies and aid workers and consumers, was released without
  any publicity at all. Trump’s pick to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, EJ
  Antoni, was in the crowd outside the Capitol on January 6 2021 when Trump
  supporters rioted in a failed effort to keep him in office. Kari Lake, the
  former Arizona news anchor Donald Trump put in charge of dismantling Voice of
  America, the congressionally funded broadcaster mandated to deliver news to
  countries without free speech, told a federal judge on Wednesday that the
  broadcaster does not need hundreds of journalists because it is in talks to
  fill its airwaves with reporting from two far-right broadcasters: Newsmax and
  One America News. In a sworn declaration filed in court on Wednesday, Lake
  told the judge, Royce Lamberth, that under her leadership, the US Agency for
  Global Media is “contracting with domestic news networks to obtain lawful
  permission to use, translate, and disseminate their content on
  USAGM-controlled means of transmission.” “The goal is to share content of
  these other networks, which reflect different perspectives and tones, with the
  populations to which we are statutorily required to broadcast”, Lake added.
  “USAGM has already reached such an agreement with One America News Network and
  is engaged in ongoing discussions with Newsmax in pursuit of a similar
  agreement. The plan is to reach out to other networks to achieve similar
  agreements.” Both One America News and Newsmax are openly partisan channels
  that work to elect Republican candidates and support Trump. Voice of America
  was known for its rigorously non-partisan journalism and provided news and
  information to countries where independent reporting is rare or impossible.
  The White House confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that EJ Antoni, the
  conservative economist Donald Trump has chosen to run the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics, was in the crowd of Trump supporters that surrounded the Capitol
  on January 6 2021. A man of Antoni’s appearance, wearing a red varsity jacket,
  was caught on video posted on the conservative social network Parler walking
  through the crowd of Trump supporters massed outside the west side of the
  Capitol about 10 minutes before the mob broke through police lines and into
  the building. That video, archived by ProPublica, shows the man in what
  appears to be a varsity jacket with the University of Pennsylvania crest on it
  walking away from that entrance to the Capitol at about 1.51 pm that day.
  According to NBC News, the man also appears in other footage recorded on the
  east side of the Capitol building during the riot. Approached for comment by
  NBC News, the White House confirmed that the man in the images was Antoni.
  “These pictures show EJ Antoni, a bystander to the events of January 6th,
  observing and then leaving the Capitol area,” White House spokesperson Taylor
  Rogers wrote to NBC News. “EJ was in town for meetings, and it is wrong and
  defamatory to suggest EJ engaged in anything inappropriate or illegal.”
  Antoni, who attended a Catholic high school and then St Charles Borromeo
  Seminary in the Philadelphia suburbs, likely has family links to the
  University of Pennsylvania, which is also Trump’s alma mater. The economist’s
  full name, given on a commencement program from Northern Illinois University,
  is Erwin J Antoni III. Graduates of the University of Pennsylvania include an
  Erwin J Antoni, who played varsity baseball, basketball and soccer, from the
  class of 1948, and an Erwin J Antoni Jr, who graduated in 1978. As Americans
  try to learn more about Antoni, given the sudden prominence of the previously
  obscure economist, his taste in art has also been a subject of online
  discussion. In a podcast appearance in 2023, Antoni acknowledged that a
  painting of a battleship behind him during the recording was from the fleet of
  Nazi Germany. Asked by the podcast host if the ship was the Bismarck, which
  engaged in naval battles with British forces in 1941, Antoni said it was. “The
  Bismarck, yep, in all his glory,” Antoni said. Antoni used the same painting
  as the backdrop for subsequent media appearances during and after the 2024
  election campaign. Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to cut
  regulations for the commercial space firms, like those owned by billionaires
  Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, speed the licensing process and eliminate
  environmental reviews for launches and reentry vehicles. The order directs the
  transportation secretary, former reality TV star and Fox News host Sean Duffy,
  to “eliminate outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive rules for launch and
  reentry vehicles,” according to a White House fact sheet. Trump also called
  for Duffy to “reevaluate, amend, or rescind” Part 450, a section of the
  Federal Aviation Administration’s licensing process for launches. The
  executive order could be a boon to Musk’s SpaceX, which is planning test
  flights of its Starship rocket. Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, donated heavily to Trump’s
  campaign and served as a special government employee at the start of his
  second term, helping to degrade and dismantle multiple government agencies.
  Bezos, whose firm Blue Origin also stands to gain from the cut in regulation,
  intervened late in the 2024 election campaign to bar his newspaper, the
  Washington Post, from publishing an endorsement of Trump’s rival, Kamala
  Harris. The White House announced on Wednesday that Donald Trump has revoked
  an executive order issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2021 which made it
  government policy to promote competition throughout the US economy. Unlike
  many of Trump’s orders, this one, which ended 72 federal initiatives to fight
  corporate monopolies and aid workers and consumers, was released without any
  publicity at all. There was no televised signing ceremony in the Oval Office,
  and no written explanation as to why the initiatives to protect consumers and
  workers were ended. The initiatives brought to a quiet end by Trump’s order on
  Wednesday included government efforts to: lower the cost of hearing aids, by
  allowing them to be sold over the counter; make it easier for airline
  passengers to get refunds for shoddy baggage handling or in-flight wifi; make
  it easier for workers to change jobs, by banning or limiting noncompete
  agreements on employees; guarantee farmers, motorists and iPhone users the
  right to repair their own vehicles or devices without voiding warranty
  protections. Biden’s order also directed the agriculture department to make it
  easier for cow, pig and poultry farmers to sue slaughterhouses who refused to
  pay them agreed upon rates and asked the Federal Trade Commission to establish
  rules for internet providers and tech companies’ use of data. Lina Khan, then
  chair of the Federal Trade Commission, called it “an important
  cross-government effort to re-center antimonopoly policy as a key tool for
  promoting a fair and thriving economy” that empowered the FTC “to address
  unchecked market concentration and promote fair competition”. When Biden’s
  order was issued, Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote that it included “many of the
  reforms I’ve been pushing to increase competition in the U.S. economy” and
  “puts power back in the hands of consumers and workers and reorients the
  economy towards everyday Americans instead of those of ultra-wealthy
  corporations and their executives.” California governor Gavin Newsom, who
  revels in trolling Donald Trump on social media, just used the president’s
  bizarre writing style in a post on X to promote a news conference on his
  state’s plan to counter Texas gerrymandering, scheduled for Thursday at
  11:30am Pacific Time. Here’s the post in full, which is clearly intended as a
  parody of Trump’s hyperbolic, all-caps style: HUGE “HISTORIC” EVENT — THURSDAY
  11:30AM PACIFIC IN LOS ANGELES!!! A “BEAUTIFUL RALLY” / PRESS CONFERENCE WITH
  GAVIN CHRISTOPHER NEWSOM &amp; STRONG DEMS. DEMOCRATS WILL DESTROY GREG
  ABBOTT’S “TOTALLY RIGGED MAPS.” TREMENDOUS WORK IS BEING DONE. DONALD TRUMP
  (THE CRIMINAL PRESIDENT) GET READY FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PAYBACK YOU’VE EVER
  SEEN!!! COULD BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE AS YOUR PRESIDENCY ENDS (DEMS
  RETAKE CONGRESS!). AMERICA WILL BE LIBERATED — “LIBERATION DAY” MANY ARE
  CALLING IT!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! — GCN Donald Trump
  has named David Rosner chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
  (Ferc), where he has served since June 2024 as a commissioner, the agency
  announced on Wednesday. The appointment of Rosner, a Democrat whose nomination
  to the commission was supported by then Senator Joe Manchin, is expected to be
  temporary. In June, Trump nominated two Republicans to the commission who are
  awaiting Senate confirmation. Ferc, which has a maximum of five members,
  regulates the power grid, liquefied natural gas projects and interstate
  transportation of oil and natural gas. It currently has just three members,
  after Mark Christie, a Republican, left last week. In June, Trump nominated
  Laura Swett to take Christie’s place and the president is expected to name her
  to become chair once the Senate confirms her. If both of Trump’s nomines are
  confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Ferc would then have a 3-2
  Republican majority. Rosner, who has worked in energy in and out of government
  for two decades, said he was honored to be named. Last year, the environmental
  group Friends of the Earth ran a campaign calling on the Senate, then
  controlled by Democrats, to block Rosner’s nomination, calling him “a paid
  cheerleader for the LNG boom”. Trump has said he wants to open pipelines to
  bring natural gas from Pennsylvania’s gas fields to states in the north-east.
  The projects have been opposed by states. A judge in Adams County, Illinois
  just rejected a request from the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, to order
  the arrest of Democrats from the Texas state legislature who left Texas to
  block a Republican plan to redraw congressional districts. In a petition filed
  last Thursday, Paxton had asked the court in a conservative county that
  overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump to honor so-called quorum warrants –
  civil arrest orders issued by Dustin Burrows, the Republican speaker of the
  Texas state house – and order Illinois police officers to “effectuate the
  civil arrest” of the Democratic lawmakers. In the ruling, which was posted
  online by Aarón Torres of the Dallas Morning News, the judge ruled that the
  Illinois circuit court “does not have the inherent power to direct Illinois
  law enforcement officers, or to allow the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of
  Representatives of the State of Texas, or any officer appointed by her, to
  execute Texas civil Quorum Warrants upon nonresidents temporarily located in
  the State of Illinois”. Today, a US federal judge struck down rules from 2018
  that allow employers to not provide insurance coverage for birth control on
  religious or moral grounds, Reuters is reporting. During Donald Trump’s first
  term in office, the supreme court ruled that employers were eligible for
  religious exemptions when it comes to providing health insurance that covers
  women’s birth control. The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare,
  requires employers to offer health insurance with access to contraception, but
  stipulates that they can apply for religious exemptions. The 2018 rules,
  however, offered a blanket exemption. According to Reuters, Judge Wendy
  Beetlestone in Philadelphia said there was a gap between how vast the
  exception is, and the number of employers who would need it. Planned
  Parenthood clinics treated people who rely on Medicaid at more than 1.5m
  visits in 2024, new research published on Wednesday shows. But the
  reproductive health giant’s ability to treat those patients is now in jeopardy
  due to Republicans’ efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood by kicking it out
  of Medicaid. Donald Trump’s tax and spending package, passed in July, bans
  Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US
  government’s insurance program for low-income people. After Planned Parenthood
  sued over the ban, a judge temporarily stopped it from taking effect. If the
  ban moves forward, experts warn that it could cripple the entirety of the US
  healthcare social safety net. Republicans have long sought to defund Planned
  Parenthood over the organization’s commitment to providing abortions. But
  Planned Parenthood does not rely on Medicaid to fund its abortion provision as
  it is already illegal to use federal dollars, including Medicaid, to pay for
  the vast majority of abortions. The 1.5m visits documented in Wednesday’s
  research paper, which was published in the medical journal Jama, only include
  visits for reasons other than abortion. “Planned Parenthood has filled a very
  important role in the reproductive healthcare safety net for people living on
  low incomes,” said Kari White, executive and scientific director at Resound
  Research for Reproductive Health. White was the lead author on the research
  paper released on Wednesday. “Other providers have counted on them to do so.
  They just don’t have the capacity to step in and fill the place that Planned
  Parenthood has had in the safety net.” The state department has approved
  potential sales of munitions, precision bombs and precision rockets to
  Nigeria, according to a statement from the Pentagon. The estimated cost totals
  $346 million. Several Texas Democratic lawmakers are now speaking about their
  redistricting fight alongside Indiana Democrats. They’re joining the
  legislators to push back against the president’s push for Indiana governor
  Mike Braun to redraw the state’s congressional map – in a similar vein to
  Texas governor Greg Abbott. Today, state representative Gene Wu, who is also
  chair of the Texas House Democrats, said that “we need more people to join
  us”. He added that if Texas Republicans continue to “block the will of the
  people” Democrats will make to “nullify their actions”. A number of Indiana
  Democratic lawmakers said that they stand in solidarity with their Texas
  counterparts. “We need to support them and stand with them, otherwise our
  people will be subjected to ever changing districts, none of which are
  representative,” said Indiana state representative Ed DeLaney. At the Kennedy
  Center today, Donald Trump announced that he would host this year’s honors
  himself – scheduled for December. But some of the biggest news came out of the
  far-reaching press conference he held after announcing this year’s honorees
  (which include ‘Rocky’ star and fervent Trump supporter Sylvester Stallone).
  Trump promised ‘very severe consequences’ if Vladimir Putin doesn’t agree to
  ceasefire at their Friday meeting in Alaska. He didn’t, however, elaborate on
  what those penalties will be. He also floated the idea of a trilateral summit
  with Volodymyr Zelenskyy “almost immediately” after his individual meeting
  with Putin. The president said that he’s eyeing an extension of the initial
  30-day limit for the federal takeover of the DC Metropolitan Police. “I don’t
  want to call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the
  Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump
  said. He added that any discussions about DC statehood are “ridiculous” and
  “unacceptable”. When it comes to the surge of federal law enforcement on DC
  streets, a White House official said 43 arrests were made on Tuesday night
  –twice the total of the previous evening. More than 1,450 officers
  participated, about half of which were from the city’s police department,
  while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly 800 that
  defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission. The city’s
  Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, has sought a cordial working relationship
  with the president since his return to the White House, but changed her tone
  on Tuesday, urging residents and voters during a social media event “to
  protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we
  elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian
  push”. At his Kennedy Center appearance today, the president continued to
  disparage Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. “He’s truly incompetent,” Trump
  said. He went on to reveal that he’ll be naming the nomination for Powell’s
  replacement “sometime in the next week”. He’s down to “three of four names,”
  he added. A reminder that Powell’s term ends in May. Additionally, on the
  foreign diplomacy front, the president took part in a virtual meeting with
  Zelenskyy and European leaders today which the German chancellor described as
  “very good” and “constructive”. Zelenskyy confirmed that Trump would call him
  straight after the Friday meeting with Putin to talk it through details. And
  finally, for now at least, a federal appeals court lifted a lower court’s
  injunction that required the state department to continue making payments to
  foreign aid contractors. In a 2-1 decision, the appellate panel effectively
  granted a Trump victory – allowing the administration to cut billions in
  congressionally appropriated funding for foreign assistance. We can soon
  expect to hear from Texas Democrats in Chicago, who will join several Indiana
  Democratic lawmakers who are pushing back against the president’s pressure
  campaign to redraw their own state’s congressional map. The White House said
  on Wednesday that law enforcement made dozens of arrests in Washington DC
  overnight after federal agents and national guard troops fanned out across the
  city as part of Donald Trump’s campaign to quell a “crime crisis” that local
  officials say does not exist. The national guard arrived on the National Mall
  late on Tuesday, while agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),
  FBI and Department of Homeland Security were seen in several neighborhoods ,
  sometimes accompanied by local police officers. Video circulating on local
  media showed police and federal agents arresting at least one person that
  evening in Columbia Heights, home to the city’s largest Hispanic population.
  Other videos showed traffic stops near Kennedy street in Northwest Washington,
  which in years past has been the site of gang activity. A White House official
  said to expect a “significantly higher” presence of national guard troops over
  the days to come, as well as round-the-clock patrols by federal agents, which
  have thus far only been present in the evenings. The administration argues the
  steps are necessary to fight what Trump has called an “out of control” crime
  problem in the nation’s capital, but local officials have disputed that
  characterization. Data shows that crime rates plunged last year to the lowest
  levels in three decades, though the capital does have higher rates of some
  violent crimes compared with cities with similar populations. Democratic
  lawmakers have condemned Trump’s incursion as an authoritarian move intended
  to distract his supporters from outrage over his refusal to make public files
  related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, a one-time friend who has
  become a fixation of conspiracy theorists. The Democratic mayor, Muriel
  Bowser, has sought a cordial relationship with Trump since his return to the
  White House, but changed her tone on Tuesday, urging residents and voters
  during a social media event “to protect our city, to protect our autonomy, to
  protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we
  elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian
  push”. A White House official said a total of 43 arrests were made on Tuesday
  night, twice the total of the previous evening. More than 1,450 officers
  participated, about half of which were from the city’s police department,
  while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly 800 that
  defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission. The White
  House said a total of 19 teams of officers from various federal agencies are
  in the city “to promote public safety and arrest violent offenders”, while the
  national guard will “protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for
  law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a
  visible law enforcement presence”. More than 40 Ice agents from Homeland
  Security Investigations (HSI, which does long-term investigations into
  transnational crimes) are working with the DC police, the Drug Enforcement
  Administration and other federal agencies this week as part of Trump’s
  takeover of the capital to mitigate crime, NBC News is reporting. Per NBC’s
  report, “they can make arrests of citizens with no nexus to immigration
  violations”. “Yesterday, HSI worked with other agencies in an operation near
  the DC Metro in Union Station; its agents told NBC News that they were not
  there for anything immigration related, but were surveying busy areas around
  DC.” Separately, Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO, which carries out
  operations like arresting immigrants for immigration crimes and detaining and
  deporting them) is increasing its operations in DC, according to NBC. The news
  outlet reports that “there was a ‘targeted enforcement operation’ to arrest
  immigrants in a Home Depot parking lot in DC yesterday, and there have been
  reports of other immigrant arrests in the DC area.” “The President was clear,
  he will make DC safe and beautiful again, and ICE is proud to be a part of the
  solution alongside our federal law enforcement partners,” an agency
  spokesperson told NBC about the operations. The agency is conducting both
  immigration enforcement operations and undertaking efforts to fight crime in
  support of the US Marshals Service, they said. They said the operations were
  intelligence-based, and the efforts at Union Station and the Home Depot
  resulted in arrests of criminal undocumented immigrants convicted of assault,
  theft and gang activity. “We will support the re-establishment of law and
  order and public safety in DC, which includes taking drug dealers, gang
  members, and criminal aliens off city streets,” they said. A senior official
  appointed to the defense department led a thinktank that promoted fake news
  about the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, according to InSight Crime, a
  non-profit analyzing organized crime. Joseph Humire was appointed this summer
  to be the head of policy focusing on the western hemisphere within the office
  of the under secretary of defense for policy. He was previously the executive
  director of a conservative thinktank focused on global security. Humire’s
  appointment comes as the Trump administration is ramping up its aggressive
  strategy against organized crime in Latin America and the Venezuelan
  government, which it accuses of working with TdA. Under Humire’s leadership,
  the Center for a Secure Free Society thinktank published the “TdA Activity
  Monitor”, tracking alleged crimes by accused members of the gang throughout
  the US. According to InSight Crime, at least five event entries in the tracker
  appeared to have been “completely fabricated”. InSight Crime found zero basis
  for the false entries, with local police departments telling researchers the
  purported crimes were nonexistent. InSight Crime analyzed more than 90 of the
  entries, finding many relied on unverified sources. “Some incidents are
  included multiple times, inflating the gang’s perceived presence and
  activities,” researchers found. Asked if he was confident he could get Putin
  to stop targeting civilians in Ukraine, Trump said: Well, I’ll tell you what.
  I’ve had that conversation with him. I’ve had a lot of good conversations with
  him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home, or a rocket
  hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street. So I guess
  the answer to that is no, because I’ve had this conversation. He ended his
  briefing there. Trump is now continuing his tirade against Federal Reserve
  chair Jerome Powell. “He’s truly incompetent,” Trump says. He then goes on to
  confirm that he’ll be naming his nomination for Powell’s replacement “sometime
  in the next week”. A reminder that Powell’s term ends in May. I‘m down to
  three or four names. All good, all great. The problem is you name them and
  then they turn out to be not good. That’s happened to me a couple of times.
  You name somebody, they tell you everything you want to hear, and then they go
  in and they turn out to be not good. Trump also describes why he has
  threatened to sue Powell over his renovation of the Federal Reserve
  headquarters. They built a basement under the building. It didn’t have a
  basement. This is simple to understand. The building is right next to a thing
  called the Potomac River… And you don’t build a built basement under a
  building that is two feet above the river, that’s right next door. The
  president kept it short and blunt when asked about the consequences Russia
  could face if Putin does not agree to stop the war at their meeting with Trump
  on Friday in Alaska. “There will be very severe consequences,” he said. Trump
  didn’t elaborate on what those penalties will be. Taking questions on his
  meeting on Friday with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the president says that if
  this week’s meeting goes well he would like a second meeting “almost
  immediately” with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Although Trump adds that
  is only if the leaders would “like to have me there”. But when it comes to
  that possible trilateral summit, Trump doesn’t say it’s a guarantee. “If I
  feel that it’s not appropriate to have it because I didn’t get the answers
  that we have to have, then we’re not going to have a second meeting,” Trump
  adds. The president confirms that he is looking to extend the initial 30-day
  limit for the federal takeover of the DC metropolitan police. “I don’t want to
  call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the Republicans in
  Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump says, referring to
  the joint resolution in Congress needed to authorize an extension (beyond the
  30-days guaranteed by Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act). Trump also says
  that any idea about DC statehood is “ridiculous” and simply states that it’s
  “not going to happen”, when answering a reporter’s question. The president is
  taking questions from the press now, and confirms he’s heard about recent
  reports that Russia is “at least in part” responsible for a recent hack of the
  computer system of the federal court system. “Are you surprised?” Trump tells
  the reporter. “They hack in. That’s what they do. They’re good at it. We’re
  good at it. We’re actually better at it.” Overall the president is using the
  Kennedy Center as part of his ongoing “beautification” ambitions for DC. “I’m
  determined to make Washington, DC safe, clean and beautiful,” Trump says. “A
  big part of that’s going to include the Kennedy Center”. Trump is switching
  between talking about his plans for a Kennedy Center renovation and the
  “public safety emergency” he’s declared in the nation’s capital. “People tell
  me they can’t run anymore. They’re just afraid, and they’ll be running again,”
  he says. “We’re going to be essentially crime free. This is going to be a
  beacon, and it’s going to also serve as an example of what can be done”. Trump
  now praises attorney general Pam Bondi – as she now oversees the DC police
  department as part of the federal takeover. You’re going to see a big change
  in Washington crime stats very soon. They’re not the stats that they gave
  because they turned out to be a total fraud. The real stats. The president has
  said he will host the Kennedy Center Honors, at the insistence of his chief of
  staff Susie Wiles. It will take place in December. The president also
  announces Sylvester Stallone, the Rocky and Rambo star who is the president’s
  newly minted “Ambassador to Hollywood”, is one of this year’s honorees. “Sly
  is a pillar of the really American pop culture and a Hollywood superstar like
  few others,” the president said. “One of the biggest names on the Hollywood
  Walk of Fame. In fact, the only one that’s a bigger name of the Hollywood Walk
  of Fame, they say, is a guy named Donald Trump”. Stallone has routinely
  praised Trump, even calling him a “second George Washington”. Joining the
  president today is Republican senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The
  president has now arrived at DC’s landmark performing arts venue, the Kennedy
  Center, to announce the recipients of this year’s honors. A reminder that
  Trump made himself the chair of the Kennedy Center earlier this year, and has
  overhauled the management and programming of the venue, including ousting its
  long-serving president Deborah Rutter. As part of Trump’s domestic policy
  bill, the Kennedy Center will also receive $257m for an extensive renovation.
  Today, a federal appeals court lifted a lower court’s injunction that required
  the state department to continue making payments to foreign aid contractors.
  In a 2-1 decision, the appellate panel effectively granted a victory for
  Trump, which means that the administration can cut billions in congressionally
  appropriated funding for foreign assistance. This also comes after the supreme
  court rejected a previous appeal to lift district judge Amir Ali’s decision
  earlier this year. National guard troops were spotted arriving on the National
  Mall late Tuesday as agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),
  FBI and Department of Homeland Security fanned out across neighborhoods in the
  capital, sometimes accompanied by local police officers. Video circulating on
  local media showed police and federal agents arresting at least one person
  that evening in Columbia Heights, home to the city’s largest Hispanic
  population. Around 800 national guard troops are expected to be deployed for
  the mission, defense officials have said. A White House official said the
  national guard “is currently providing support to federal law enforcement
  agents. Their role is to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment
  for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a
  visible law enforcement presence”. It was unclear how many arrests were made
  on Tuesday night and by which agencies. The US attorney’s office, Metropolitan
  police department and DEA, whose head has been appointed temporary
  administrator of the police department, did not immediately respond to
  requests for comments. My colleague Jakub Krupa has been keeping up with the
  latest developments following Donald Trump’s virtual meeting with European
  leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A few of the top lines
  are here: German chancellor Frederich Merz said that Trump “largely shares”
  the European position, and characterised the meeting as a “very good,
  constructive talk”. For his part Zelenskyy emphasised the importance of a
  trilateral meeting with Trump and Putin. He also confirmed that Trump said he
  would call him straight after the meeting with Putin to talk it through it.
  Meanwhile, Jakub reports that Nato secretary general Mark Rutte posted on
  social media, saying it was a “great call”, and emphasised Nato unity to end
  the war in Ukraine and “achieve just and lasting peace”. The president is
  considering 11 candidates to replace Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell when
  his terms ends in May, according to a report from CNBC. According to CNBC’s
  sources this long list includes three people who have not yet been mentioned
  publicly. Per CNBC these include: David Zervos, Jefferies chief market
  strategist, former Federal Reserve governor Larry Lindsey, and Rick Rieder, a
  chief investment officer at BlackRock. A reminder, that should Donald Trump
  replace Powell, his pick must be confirmed by the US Senate. An interesting
  news nugget today comes by way of writer Kyle Tharp – who writes the Chaotic
  Era newsletter. In his latest post, he finds that only three politicians have
  found much success in their podcast endeavors. Tharp’s reporting, which uses
  data from Podscribe, finds that Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas averaged
  more than 1.4m monthly downloads last month for his podcast The Verdict.
  Meanwhile, California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom and Republican
  congressman Dan Crenshaw managed to break more than 400,000 and 300,000
  downloads for their respective shows. There’s a precipitous drop in average
  monthly downloads after that, according to Tharp. He reports that “more than
  two dozen leading elected officials” have attempted to host their own podcasts
  in recent years. Also today, we can expect to hear from Texas Democrats – who
  left the state over a week ago to deny quorum in protest of gerrymandered
  GOP-drawn maps. The legislators will join Indiana lawmakers as the Trump
  administration applies pressure on the Indiana governor Mike Braun to also
  redraw the state’s map. A reminder that yesterday, the Texas Senate approved a
  map that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026
  midterms. But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation
  isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said the House will adjourn until
  Friday, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more
  time. If Friday’s attempt fails, Texas governor Greg Abbott said he’ll call a
  second session immediately. Rural communities are seeing a key aspect of life
  affected amid Trump’s immigration crackdown and Ice raids. Harrisonburg,
  Virginia, a town of 50,000 people in the Shenandoah Valley, should have been
  alive with the color, sound and smells of local Latino culture. Soccer
  tournaments, taco trucks, Salvadorian chanchona musical bands and about 4,000
  visitors were last month set to attend the town’s Hispanic Festival held at a
  sports complex outside the town. But this year, it’s not happening. US
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents have been active in the
  Harrisonburg area for months, prompting organizers to cancel the festival.
  “There have been instances of raids targeting immigrant families and
  workplaces in the past. While we had no confirmed reports that Ice planned to
  target the festival, the general climate of fear is very real,” says Crimson
  Solano, executive director of the Coalición Solidaria Pro-Inmigrantes Unidos
  (COSPU), which runs the festival. “This fear undermines the purpose of the
  festival, which is to create a safe, celebratory space for our community.”
  Festivals and fairs are a mainstay of small-town American life. But now from
  rural Indiana to a tiny village in Washington state to cornerstone Appalachian
  towns such as Harrisonburg, Latino and other international festivals are being
  cancelled this summer due to fears of raids by Ice agents. Read more here: My
  colleagues will be bringing you the very latest developments on the
  president’s virtual meetings with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.
  You can follow along here As they noted, Donald Trump just praised his
  European counterparts as “great people who want to see a deal done”, in a post
  on Truth Social. The president has also undermined various reports that
  include critics of his upcoming meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin
  in Alaska. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that the “very unfair media”
  is “constantly quoting fired losers and really dump people like John Bolton”.
  In an article published in the Atlantic on Tuesday, the former national
  security adviser said: “Putin has already won. He is the leader of a rogue
  state, and he’ll get a picture on U.S. soil with the president of the United
  States.” Similarly, in an interview with CNN last week, Bolton said that the
  “initial set-up” for Friday’s summit is a “great victory for Putin”. But Trump
  wasted no time in the post calling out the press as “are sick and dishonest
  people, who probably hate our country”. We can expect to hear from Donald
  Trump at least a few times today. According to the president’s daily schedule,
  he’ll make an appearance at the Kennedy Center at 11am ET, and make an
  announcement. He’ll then head back to the White House and sign executive
  orders at 4pm ET. For now this will be closed press, but could very well open
  up. Donald Trump, ahead of his planned virtual meeting with European leaders
  and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy later on Wednesday, praised
  Europe’s leaders in a post on social media and said they “want to see a deal
  done.” In a post on Truth Social, the president wrote: Will be speaking to
  European Leaders in a short while. They are great people who want to see a
  deal done. That was followed shortly after with another post, criticising the
  way his upcoming meeting with Putin has been portrayed in the media. Trump
  wrote: Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly
  quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said
  that, even though the meeting is on American soil, “Putin has already won.”
  What’s that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING. The Fake News is working
  overtime (No tax on overtime!). If I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of
  the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal! But now
  they’ve been caught. Look at all of the real news that’s coming out about
  their CORRUPTION. They are sick and dishonest people, who probably hate our
  Country. But it doesn’t matter because we are winning on everything!!! MAGA

  Muriel Bowser last night hardened her stance on Donald Trump using federal
  agents to police the city, calling the president’s move an “authoritarian
  push”. Speaking during a live town hall on social media, the mayor of
  Washington DC urged community members to “protect our city, to protect our
  autonomy, to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and
  make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this
  authoritarian push”. “We are not 700,000 scumbags and punks,” she added. “We
  don’t have neighborhoods that should be bulldozed. We have to be clear about
  our story, who we are and what we want for our city.” Bowser had previously
  pledged to work “side with side” with the federal officials Trump has tasked
  with overseeing the city’s law enforcement, while insisting the police chief
  remained in charge of the department and its officers. Speaking on Tuesday
  after a meeting with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, Bowser told reporters:
  “What I’m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the
  additional officer support that we have.” About 850 officers and agents took
  part in a “massive law enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night
  and made nearly two dozen arrests, the White House has said. The violent crime
  rate in Washington DC is at a 30-year low. Trump’s intervention has been
  widely condemned as an authoritarian power grab that undermines the autonomy
  of Washington’s DC local government and seeks to distract attention from
  political problems such as the Jeffrey Epstein files. In May, the Arizona
  representative Yassamin Ansari toured a detention facility where immigrants
  rounded up as part of the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportation
  were being housed. She described what she saw inside as “sickening” and “worse
  than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in overcrowded, moldy cells and
  many reported that they did not have reliable access to food, water or medical
  care. Two months later, Ansari returned to the remote desert complex to
  conduct another congressional oversight visit. This time, she was denied
  entry. It wasn’t an isolated incident. From New York to California, Democratic
  members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention
  facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions
  – are being held. Democratic officials’ legislative checks – a legal right for
  members of Congress – have consistently confirmed reports that immigrant
  detainees are being kept in “filthy” and “inhumane” conditions with little
  regard for due process. Now, the facilities have become a battleground in the
  intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Democratic
  lawmakers over the president’s supercharged immigration agenda. “The
  administration’s goal is to intimidate us and bully us, bully us out of doing
  our jobs for sure,” congresswoman LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who
  has been accused of assaulting federal agents during a confrontation at the
  Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If they can get away with
  doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to anyone. But more
  importantly, imagine what they’re doing in the dark to others who are not of
  an elected status, who are not in public eye view.” McIver, who has pleaded
  not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month later,
  detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory wall – an
  act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and overcrowding. The
  closely watched New York mayoral and governor’s races appear to be forming
  into shapes that will bring little comfort to centrist Democrats, with
  elections happening in November this year in New York City and the
  gubernatorial vote a year later. A new Siena Institute poll released on
  Tuesday shows New York City’s Democratic socialist mayoral candidate, Zohran
  Mamdani, leading former New York governor Andrew Cuomo by 19 percentage points
  – while the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik is chipping away at
  incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul’s lead in a hypothetical contest for the New
  York governor’s mansion in 2026. Hochul’s lead over Stefanik, who was
  nominated to be US ambassador to the United Nations before withdrawing to help
  Republicans maintain a majority in Congress, has now dropped from 23 points in
  June to 14 points. Stefanik has not officially decided on whether to seek the
  governor’s office, but she has been noticeably attacking Hochul’s record. The
  poll found that 49% of voters in the state said it would be bad for New York
  if Stefanik were elected governor. “The latest Siena poll is catastrophic for
  Kathy Hochul as she is losing independent voters to Elise Stefanik, is below
  50% on the ballot, and only 35% of voters want to re-elect Kathy Hochul,” said
  Stefanik’s executive director Alex DeGrasse in a statement to the Guardian. He
  predicted voters are looking to Stefanik to deliver new leadership. California
  governor Gavin Newsom says the state will draw new electoral maps after Donald
  Trump “missed” a deadline on Tuesday night in an ongoing redistricting battle
  between Democratic and Republican states. “DONALD ‘TACO’ TRUMP, AS MANY CALL
  HIM, ‘MISSED’ THE DEADLINE!!!”, Newsom’s office wrote on social media.
  “CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE ‘BEAUTIFUL MAPS,’ THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS
  THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!)”. “BIG PRESS
  CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM — YOUR FAVORITE
  GOVERNOR — THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR ‘MAGA.’ THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
  TO THIS MATTER! — GN,” reads the post. The post follows a series of snarky,
  all-caps tweets meant to mimic Trump’s social media writing style. Newsom was
  mocking Trump’s moniker, “Taco”, short for “Trump always chickens out”,
  prompted by his flip-flopping deadlines. Several states have waded into the
  redistricting wars, where Newsom and other Democratic state leaders had
  threatened to draw retaliatory maps if Texas were to move ahead with its
  redistricting scheme. Donald Trump’s administration has significantly changed
  a key US government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening
  criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican
  president, such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have
  well-established histories of abuses. Instead, the US state department sounded
  an alarm about what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and
  ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has
  clashed with over a host of issues. Criticism of governments over their
  treatment of LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of
  the report, appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”. The report’s
  section on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no
  mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000
  people have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of
  Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian
  militant group Hamas in October 2023. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is
  likely to meet Donald Trump during a visit to the US next month to attend the
  UN General Assembly meeting, the Indian Express newspaper reported on
  Wednesday, citing sources. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately
  respond to a request for comment. An Indian official familiar with the matter
  said a decision has not yet been taken, and that countries usually reserve
  slots for the general debate at the assembly, which is why India’s “head of
  government” features in a provisional list of speakers on 26 September. A US
  judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to restore a part of the
  federal grant funding that it recently suspended for the University of
  California, Los Angeles. US district judge Rita Lin in San Francisco ruled
  that the grant funding suspensions violated an earlier June preliminary
  injunction where she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore dozens
  of grants that it had terminated at the University of California. That order
  had blocked the agency from cancelling other grants at the University of
  California system, of which UCLA is a part. “NSF’s actions violate the
  Preliminary Injunction,” Lin, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe
  Biden, wrote. The White House and the university had no immediate comment on
  the ruling. UCLA said last week the government froze $584m in funding. Trump
  has threatened to cut federal funds for universities over pro-Palestinian
  student protests against US ally Israel’s military assault on Gaza. The Los
  Angeles Times newspaper reported that the judge’s order asked for the
  restoration of more than a third of the suspended $584m funding. The
  University of California said last week it was reviewing a settlement offer by
  the Trump administration for UCLA in which the university will pay $1bn. It
  said such a large payment would “devastate” the institution. The government
  alleges universities, including UCLA, allowed antisemitism during the
  protests. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom
  Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news. We start with the news
  that Donald Trump will be visiting the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, the same
  day that the recipients of this year’s honors are announced. Trump avoided the
  Kennedy Center Honors during his first term after artists said they would not
  attend out of protest. This year, he has taken over as the Kennedy Center‘s
  new chair and fired the board of trustees, which he replaced with loyalists.
  In a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump teased a name change for the performing
  arts center and said it would be restored to its former glory, AP reported.
  “GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER,
  AWARDS,” Trump wrote. He said work was being done on the site that would be
  “bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and
  entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE
  MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. It is unclear how this year’s batch of
  honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role.
  Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over
  the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin
  and Stephen Sondheim. A message sent to the Kennedy Center press office asking
  how this year’s honorees were selected wasn’t returned Tuesday. The Kennedy
  Center did post this on social media, however: “Coming Soon ... A country
  music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a
  multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...” In
  other developments: The DC national guard began deploying on the city’s
  streets Tuesday night, a day after Trump ordered their arrival and took
  control of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city,
  despite official crime statistics saying otherwise. A federal judge ordered
  the Trump administration to immediately improve conditions at a New York City
  immigration holding facility, acting on mounting complaints from detainees
  that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. The Texas Senate
  approved a GOP-drawn congressional map that would give Republicans five more
  House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But since House Democrats continue to
  break quorum, the legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows
  said the House will adjourn until Friday, at which point the legislature will
  attempt to reach quorum one more time. Trump is due to speak with European
  leaders, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, today ahead of Friday’s meeting with
  Russian president Vladimir Putin. Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt
  characterised Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin as a “listening
  exercise” for the president, confirming that Zelenskyy would not be in
  attendance, but the president has hopes for a trilateral meeting in the
  future. For more on the upcoming meeting, follow our Europe live blog here.
  California governor Gavin Newsom says the state will draw new electoral maps
  after Trump “missed” a deadline on Tuesday night in an ongoing redistricting
  battle between Democratic and Republican states. The Trump administration is
  evidently extending its control of cultural representation at the Smithsonian,
  the world’s largest museum and research complex. In a letter posted on the
  White House website, the administration told the Smithsonian that it plans a
  wide review of exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of the US’s 250th
  anniversary celebrations in 2026.

This bring our live coverage of the second Trump administration to a close for the day, but we will return on Thursday morning. Here are the latest developments: Donald Trump said that he plans to extend the federal takeover of the DC Metropolitan Police for more than the legally mandated 30 days. “I don’t want to call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump said. Trump promised ‘very severe consequences’ if Vladimir Putin doesn’t agree to ceasefire at their Friday meeting in Alaska. He didn’t, however, elaborate on what those penalties will be. Trump took part in a virtual meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders ahead of his summit in Alaska with Putin which the German chancellor described as “constructive”. Zelenskyy confirmed that Trump said he would call him right after the meeting with Putin. At the Kennedy Center, Trump announced that he would host this year’s honors himself. California governor Gavin Newsom, who revels in trolling Trump on social media, used the president’s bizarre writing style to promote a news conference on his state’s plan to counter Texas gerrymandering, scheduled for Thursday at 11:30am Pacific Time. The White House announced that Trump revoked an executive order issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden, which made it government policy to promote competition throughout the US economy. Unlike many of Trump’s orders, this one, which ended 72 federal initiatives to fight corporate monopolies and aid workers and consumers, was released without any publicity at all. Trump’s pick to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, EJ Antoni, was in the crowd outside the Capitol on January 6 2021 when Trump supporters rioted in a failed effort to keep him in office. Kari Lake, the former Arizona news anchor Donald Trump put in charge of dismantling Voice of America, the congressionally funded broadcaster mandated to deliver news to countries without free speech, told a federal judge on Wednesday that the broadcaster does not need hundreds of journalists because it is in talks to fill its airwaves with reporting from two far-right broadcasters: Newsmax and One America News. In a sworn declaration filed in court on Wednesday, Lake told the judge, Royce Lamberth, that under her leadership, the US Agency for Global Media is “contracting with domestic news networks to obtain lawful permission to use, translate, and disseminate their content on USAGM-controlled means of transmission.” “The goal is to share content of these other networks, which reflect different perspectives and tones, with the populations to which we are statutorily required to broadcast”, Lake added. “USAGM has already reached such an agreement with One America News Network and is engaged in ongoing discussions with Newsmax in pursuit of a similar agreement. The plan is to reach out to other networks to achieve similar agreements.” Both One America News and Newsmax are openly partisan channels that work to elect Republican candidates and support Trump. Voice of America was known for its rigorously non-partisan journalism and provided news and information to countries where independent reporting is rare or impossible. The White House confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that EJ Antoni, the conservative economist Donald Trump has chosen to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was in the crowd of Trump supporters that surrounded the Capitol on January 6 2021. A man of Antoni’s appearance, wearing a red varsity jacket, was caught on video posted on the conservative social network Parler walking through the crowd of Trump supporters massed outside the west side of the Capitol about 10 minutes before the mob broke through police lines and into the building. That video, archived by ProPublica, shows the man in what appears to be a varsity jacket with the University of Pennsylvania crest on it walking away from that entrance to the Capitol at about 1.51 pm that day. According to NBC News, the man also appears in other footage recorded on the east side of the Capitol building during the riot. Approached for comment by NBC News, the White House confirmed that the man in the images was Antoni. “These pictures show EJ Antoni, a bystander to the events of January 6th, observing and then leaving the Capitol area,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote to NBC News. “EJ was in town for meetings, and it is wrong and defamatory to suggest EJ engaged in anything inappropriate or illegal.” Antoni, who attended a Catholic high school and then St Charles Borromeo Seminary in the Philadelphia suburbs, likely has family links to the University of Pennsylvania, which is also Trump’s alma mater. The economist’s full name, given on a commencement program from Northern Illinois University, is Erwin J Antoni III. Graduates of the University of Pennsylvania include an Erwin J Antoni, who played varsity baseball, basketball and soccer, from the class of 1948, and an Erwin J Antoni Jr, who graduated in 1978. As Americans try to learn more about Antoni, given the sudden prominence of the previously obscure economist, his taste in art has also been a subject of online discussion. In a podcast appearance in 2023, Antoni acknowledged that a painting of a battleship behind him during the recording was from the fleet of Nazi Germany. Asked by the podcast host if the ship was the Bismarck, which engaged in naval battles with British forces in 1941, Antoni said it was. “The Bismarck, yep, in all his glory,” Antoni said. Antoni used the same painting as the backdrop for subsequent media appearances during and after the 2024 election campaign. Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to cut regulations for the commercial space firms, like those owned by billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, speed the licensing process and eliminate environmental reviews for launches and reentry vehicles. The order directs the transportation secretary, former reality TV star and Fox News host Sean Duffy, to “eliminate outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive rules for launch and reentry vehicles,” according to a White House fact sheet. Trump also called for Duffy to “reevaluate, amend, or rescind” Part 450, a section of the Federal Aviation Administration’s licensing process for launches. The executive order could be a boon to Musk’s SpaceX, which is planning test flights of its Starship rocket. Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, donated heavily to Trump’s campaign and served as a special government employee at the start of his second term, helping to degrade and dismantle multiple government agencies. Bezos, whose firm Blue Origin also stands to gain from the cut in regulation, intervened late in the 2024 election campaign to bar his newspaper, the Washington Post, from publishing an endorsement of Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris. The White House announced on Wednesday that Donald Trump has revoked an executive order issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2021 which made it government policy to promote competition throughout the US economy. Unlike many of Trump’s orders, this one, which ended 72 federal initiatives to fight corporate monopolies and aid workers and consumers, was released without any publicity at all. There was no televised signing ceremony in the Oval Office, and no written explanation as to why the initiatives to protect consumers and workers were ended. The initiatives brought to a quiet end by Trump’s order on Wednesday included government efforts to: lower the cost of hearing aids, by allowing them to be sold over the counter; make it easier for airline passengers to get refunds for shoddy baggage handling or in-flight wifi; make it easier for workers to change jobs, by banning or limiting noncompete agreements on employees; guarantee farmers, motorists and iPhone users the right to repair their own vehicles or devices without voiding warranty protections. Biden’s order also directed the agriculture department to make it easier for cow, pig and poultry farmers to sue slaughterhouses who refused to pay them agreed upon rates and asked the Federal Trade Commission to establish rules for internet providers and tech companies’ use of data. Lina Khan, then chair of the Federal Trade Commission, called it “an important cross-government effort to re-center antimonopoly policy as a key tool for promoting a fair and thriving economy” that empowered the FTC “to address unchecked market concentration and promote fair competition”. When Biden’s order was issued, Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote that it included “many of the reforms I’ve been pushing to increase competition in the U.S. economy” and “puts power back in the hands of consumers and workers and reorients the economy towards everyday Americans instead of those of ultra-wealthy corporations and their executives.” California governor Gavin Newsom, who revels in trolling Donald Trump on social media, just used the president’s bizarre writing style in a post on X to promote a news conference on his state’s plan to counter Texas gerrymandering, scheduled for Thursday at 11:30am Pacific Time. Here’s the post in full, which is clearly intended as a parody of Trump’s hyperbolic, all-caps style: HUGE “HISTORIC” EVENT — THURSDAY 11:30AM PACIFIC IN LOS ANGELES!!! A “BEAUTIFUL RALLY” / PRESS CONFERENCE WITH GAVIN CHRISTOPHER NEWSOM &amp; STRONG DEMS. DEMOCRATS WILL DESTROY GREG ABBOTT’S “TOTALLY RIGGED MAPS.” TREMENDOUS WORK IS BEING DONE. DONALD TRUMP (THE CRIMINAL PRESIDENT) GET READY FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PAYBACK YOU’VE EVER SEEN!!! COULD BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE AS YOUR PRESIDENCY ENDS (DEMS RETAKE CONGRESS!). AMERICA WILL BE LIBERATED — “LIBERATION DAY” MANY ARE CALLING IT!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! — GCN Donald Trump has named David Rosner chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc), where he has served since June 2024 as a commissioner, the agency announced on Wednesday. The appointment of Rosner, a Democrat whose nomination to the commission was supported by then Senator Joe Manchin, is expected to be temporary. In June, Trump nominated two Republicans to the commission who are awaiting Senate confirmation. Ferc, which has a maximum of five members, regulates the power grid, liquefied natural gas projects and interstate transportation of oil and natural gas. It currently has just three members, after Mark Christie, a Republican, left last week. In June, Trump nominated Laura Swett to take Christie’s place and the president is expected to name her to become chair once the Senate confirms her. If both of Trump’s nomines are confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Ferc would then have a 3-2 Republican majority. Rosner, who has worked in energy in and out of government for two decades, said he was honored to be named. Last year, the environmental group Friends of the Earth ran a campaign calling on the Senate, then controlled by Democrats, to block Rosner’s nomination, calling him “a paid cheerleader for the LNG boom”. Trump has said he wants to open pipelines to bring natural gas from Pennsylvania’s gas fields to states in the north-east. The projects have been opposed by states. A judge in Adams County, Illinois just rejected a request from the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, to order the arrest of Democrats from the Texas state legislature who left Texas to block a Republican plan to redraw congressional districts. In a petition filed last Thursday, Paxton had asked the court in a conservative county that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump to honor so-called quorum warrants – civil arrest orders issued by Dustin Burrows, the Republican speaker of the Texas state house – and order Illinois police officers to “effectuate the civil arrest” of the Democratic lawmakers. In the ruling, which was posted online by Aarón Torres of the Dallas Morning News, the judge ruled that the Illinois circuit court “does not have the inherent power to direct Illinois law enforcement officers, or to allow the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives of the State of Texas, or any officer appointed by her, to execute Texas civil Quorum Warrants upon nonresidents temporarily located in the State of Illinois”. Today, a US federal judge struck down rules from 2018 that allow employers to not provide insurance coverage for birth control on religious or moral grounds, Reuters is reporting. During Donald Trump’s first term in office, the supreme court ruled that employers were eligible for religious exemptions when it comes to providing health insurance that covers women’s birth control. The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, requires employers to offer health insurance with access to contraception, but stipulates that they can apply for religious exemptions. The 2018 rules, however, offered a blanket exemption. According to Reuters, Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia said there was a gap between how vast the exception is, and the number of employers who would need it. Planned Parenthood clinics treated people who rely on Medicaid at more than 1.5m visits in 2024, new research published on Wednesday shows. But the reproductive health giant’s ability to treat those patients is now in jeopardy due to Republicans’ efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood by kicking it out of Medicaid. Donald Trump’s tax and spending package, passed in July, bans Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people. After Planned Parenthood sued over the ban, a judge temporarily stopped it from taking effect. If the ban moves forward, experts warn that it could cripple the entirety of the US healthcare social safety net. Republicans have long sought to defund Planned Parenthood over the organization’s commitment to providing abortions. But Planned Parenthood does not rely on Medicaid to fund its abortion provision as it is already illegal to use federal dollars, including Medicaid, to pay for the vast majority of abortions. The 1.5m visits documented in Wednesday’s research paper, which was published in the medical journal Jama, only include visits for reasons other than abortion. “Planned Parenthood has filled a very important role in the reproductive healthcare safety net for people living on low incomes,” said Kari White, executive and scientific director at Resound Research for Reproductive Health. White was the lead author on the research paper released on Wednesday. “Other providers have counted on them to do so. They just don’t have the capacity to step in and fill the place that Planned Parenthood has had in the safety net.” The state department has approved potential sales of munitions, precision bombs and precision rockets to Nigeria, according to a statement from the Pentagon. The estimated cost totals $346 million. Several Texas Democratic lawmakers are now speaking about their redistricting fight alongside Indiana Democrats. They’re joining the legislators to push back against the president’s push for Indiana governor Mike Braun to redraw the state’s congressional map – in a similar vein to Texas governor Greg Abbott. Today, state representative Gene Wu, who is also chair of the Texas House Democrats, said that “we need more people to join us”. He added that if Texas Republicans continue to “block the will of the people” Democrats will make to “nullify their actions”. A number of Indiana Democratic lawmakers said that they stand in solidarity with their Texas counterparts. “We need to support them and stand with them, otherwise our people will be subjected to ever changing districts, none of which are representative,” said Indiana state representative Ed DeLaney. At the Kennedy Center today, Donald Trump announced that he would host this year’s honors himself – scheduled for December. But some of the biggest news came out of the far-reaching press conference he held after announcing this year’s honorees (which include ‘Rocky’ star and fervent Trump supporter Sylvester Stallone). Trump promised ‘very severe consequences’ if Vladimir Putin doesn’t agree to ceasefire at their Friday meeting in Alaska. He didn’t, however, elaborate on what those penalties will be. He also floated the idea of a trilateral summit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy “almost immediately” after his individual meeting with Putin. The president said that he’s eyeing an extension of the initial 30-day limit for the federal takeover of the DC Metropolitan Police. “I don’t want to call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump said. He added that any discussions about DC statehood are “ridiculous” and “unacceptable”. When it comes to the surge of federal law enforcement on DC streets, a White House official said 43 arrests were made on Tuesday night –twice the total of the previous evening. More than 1,450 officers participated, about half of which were from the city’s police department, while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly 800 that defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission. The city’s Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, has sought a cordial working relationship with the president since his return to the White House, but changed her tone on Tuesday, urging residents and voters during a social media event “to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push”. At his Kennedy Center appearance today, the president continued to disparage Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. “He’s truly incompetent,” Trump said. He went on to reveal that he’ll be naming the nomination for Powell’s replacement “sometime in the next week”. He’s down to “three of four names,” he added. A reminder that Powell’s term ends in May. Additionally, on the foreign diplomacy front, the president took part in a virtual meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders today which the German chancellor described as “very good” and “constructive”. Zelenskyy confirmed that Trump would call him straight after the Friday meeting with Putin to talk it through details. And finally, for now at least, a federal appeals court lifted a lower court’s injunction that required the state department to continue making payments to foreign aid contractors. In a 2-1 decision, the appellate panel effectively granted a Trump victory – allowing the administration to cut billions in congressionally appropriated funding for foreign assistance. We can soon expect to hear from Texas Democrats in Chicago, who will join several Indiana Democratic lawmakers who are pushing back against the president’s pressure campaign to redraw their own state’s congressional map. The White House said on Wednesday that law enforcement made dozens of arrests in Washington DC overnight after federal agents and national guard troops fanned out across the city as part of Donald Trump’s campaign to quell a “crime crisis” that local officials say does not exist. The national guard arrived on the National Mall late on Tuesday, while agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FBI and Department of Homeland Security were seen in several neighborhoods , sometimes accompanied by local police officers. Video circulating on local media showed police and federal agents arresting at least one person that evening in Columbia Heights, home to the city’s largest Hispanic population. Other videos showed traffic stops near Kennedy street in Northwest Washington, which in years past has been the site of gang activity. A White House official said to expect a “significantly higher” presence of national guard troops over the days to come, as well as round-the-clock patrols by federal agents, which have thus far only been present in the evenings. The administration argues the steps are necessary to fight what Trump has called an “out of control” crime problem in the nation’s capital, but local officials have disputed that characterization. Data shows that crime rates plunged last year to the lowest levels in three decades, though the capital does have higher rates of some violent crimes compared with cities with similar populations. Democratic lawmakers have condemned Trump’s incursion as an authoritarian move intended to distract his supporters from outrage over his refusal to make public files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, a one-time friend who has become a fixation of conspiracy theorists. The Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, has sought a cordial relationship with Trump since his return to the White House, but changed her tone on Tuesday, urging residents and voters during a social media event “to protect our city, to protect our autonomy, to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push”. A White House official said a total of 43 arrests were made on Tuesday night, twice the total of the previous evening. More than 1,450 officers participated, about half of which were from the city’s police department, while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly 800 that defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission. The White House said a total of 19 teams of officers from various federal agencies are in the city “to promote public safety and arrest violent offenders”, while the national guard will “protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence”. More than 40 Ice agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI, which does long-term investigations into transnational crimes) are working with the DC police, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal agencies this week as part of Trump’s takeover of the capital to mitigate crime, NBC News is reporting. Per NBC’s report, “they can make arrests of citizens with no nexus to immigration violations”. “Yesterday, HSI worked with other agencies in an operation near the DC Metro in Union Station; its agents told NBC News that they were not there for anything immigration related, but were surveying busy areas around DC.” Separately, Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO, which carries out operations like arresting immigrants for immigration crimes and detaining and deporting them) is increasing its operations in DC, according to NBC. The news outlet reports that “there was a ‘targeted enforcement operation’ to arrest immigrants in a Home Depot parking lot in DC yesterday, and there have been reports of other immigrant arrests in the DC area.” “The President was clear, he will make DC safe and beautiful again, and ICE is proud to be a part of the solution alongside our federal law enforcement partners,” an agency spokesperson told NBC about the operations. The agency is conducting both immigration enforcement operations and undertaking efforts to fight crime in support of the US Marshals Service, they said. They said the operations were intelligence-based, and the efforts at Union Station and the Home Depot resulted in arrests of criminal undocumented immigrants convicted of assault, theft and gang activity. “We will support the re-establishment of law and order and public safety in DC, which includes taking drug dealers, gang members, and criminal aliens off city streets,” they said. A senior official appointed to the defense department led a thinktank that promoted fake news about the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, according to InSight Crime, a non-profit analyzing organized crime. Joseph Humire was appointed this summer to be the head of policy focusing on the western hemisphere within the office of the under secretary of defense for policy. He was previously the executive director of a conservative thinktank focused on global security. Humire’s appointment comes as the Trump administration is ramping up its aggressive strategy against organized crime in Latin America and the Venezuelan government, which it accuses of working with TdA. Under Humire’s leadership, the Center for a Secure Free Society thinktank published the “TdA Activity Monitor”, tracking alleged crimes by accused members of the gang throughout the US. According to InSight Crime, at least five event entries in the tracker appeared to have been “completely fabricated”. InSight Crime found zero basis for the false entries, with local police departments telling researchers the purported crimes were nonexistent. InSight Crime analyzed more than 90 of the entries, finding many relied on unverified sources. “Some incidents are included multiple times, inflating the gang’s perceived presence and activities,” researchers found. Asked if he was confident he could get Putin to stop targeting civilians in Ukraine, Trump said: Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ve had that conversation with him. I’ve had a lot of good conversations with him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home, or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I’ve had this conversation. He ended his briefing there. Trump is now continuing his tirade against Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. “He’s truly incompetent,” Trump says. He then goes on to confirm that he’ll be naming his nomination for Powell’s replacement “sometime in the next week”. A reminder that Powell’s term ends in May. I‘m down to three or four names. All good, all great. The problem is you name them and then they turn out to be not good. That’s happened to me a couple of times. You name somebody, they tell you everything you want to hear, and then they go in and they turn out to be not good. Trump also describes why he has threatened to sue Powell over his renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters. They built a basement under the building. It didn’t have a basement. This is simple to understand. The building is right next to a thing called the Potomac River… And you don’t build a built basement under a building that is two feet above the river, that’s right next door. The president kept it short and blunt when asked about the consequences Russia could face if Putin does not agree to stop the war at their meeting with Trump on Friday in Alaska. “There will be very severe consequences,” he said. Trump didn’t elaborate on what those penalties will be. Taking questions on his meeting on Friday with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the president says that if this week’s meeting goes well he would like a second meeting “almost immediately” with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Although Trump adds that is only if the leaders would “like to have me there”. But when it comes to that possible trilateral summit, Trump doesn’t say it’s a guarantee. “If I feel that it’s not appropriate to have it because I didn’t get the answers that we have to have, then we’re not going to have a second meeting,” Trump adds. The president confirms that he is looking to extend the initial 30-day limit for the federal takeover of the DC metropolitan police. “I don’t want to call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump says, referring to the joint resolution in Congress needed to authorize an extension (beyond the 30-days guaranteed by Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act). Trump also says that any idea about DC statehood is “ridiculous” and simply states that it’s “not going to happen”, when answering a reporter’s question. The president is taking questions from the press now, and confirms he’s heard about recent reports that Russia is “at least in part” responsible for a recent hack of the computer system of the federal court system. “Are you surprised?” Trump tells the reporter. “They hack in. That’s what they do. They’re good at it. We’re good at it. We’re actually better at it.” Overall the president is using the Kennedy Center as part of his ongoing “beautification” ambitions for DC. “I’m determined to make Washington, DC safe, clean and beautiful,” Trump says. “A big part of that’s going to include the Kennedy Center”. Trump is switching between talking about his plans for a Kennedy Center renovation and the “public safety emergency” he’s declared in the nation’s capital. “People tell me they can’t run anymore. They’re just afraid, and they’ll be running again,” he says. “We’re going to be essentially crime free. This is going to be a beacon, and it’s going to also serve as an example of what can be done”. Trump now praises attorney general Pam Bondi – as she now oversees the DC police department as part of the federal takeover. You’re going to see a big change in Washington crime stats very soon. They’re not the stats that they gave because they turned out to be a total fraud. The real stats. The president has said he will host the Kennedy Center Honors, at the insistence of his chief of staff Susie Wiles. It will take place in December. The president also announces Sylvester Stallone, the Rocky and Rambo star who is the president’s newly minted “Ambassador to Hollywood”, is one of this year’s honorees. “Sly is a pillar of the really American pop culture and a Hollywood superstar like few others,” the president said. “One of the biggest names on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In fact, the only one that’s a bigger name of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they say, is a guy named Donald Trump”. Stallone has routinely praised Trump, even calling him a “second George Washington”. Joining the president today is Republican senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The president has now arrived at DC’s landmark performing arts venue, the Kennedy Center, to announce the recipients of this year’s honors. A reminder that Trump made himself the chair of the Kennedy Center earlier this year, and has overhauled the management and programming of the venue, including ousting its long-serving president Deborah Rutter. As part of Trump’s domestic policy bill, the Kennedy Center will also receive $257m for an extensive renovation. Today, a federal appeals court lifted a lower court’s injunction that required the state department to continue making payments to foreign aid contractors. In a 2-1 decision, the appellate panel effectively granted a victory for Trump, which means that the administration can cut billions in congressionally appropriated funding for foreign assistance. This also comes after the supreme court rejected a previous appeal to lift district judge Amir Ali’s decision earlier this year. National guard troops were spotted arriving on the National Mall late Tuesday as agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FBI and Department of Homeland Security fanned out across neighborhoods in the capital, sometimes accompanied by local police officers. Video circulating on local media showed police and federal agents arresting at least one person that evening in Columbia Heights, home to the city’s largest Hispanic population. Around 800 national guard troops are expected to be deployed for the mission, defense officials have said. A White House official said the national guard “is currently providing support to federal law enforcement agents. Their role is to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence”. It was unclear how many arrests were made on Tuesday night and by which agencies. The US attorney’s office, Metropolitan police department and DEA, whose head has been appointed temporary administrator of the police department, did not immediately respond to requests for comments. My colleague Jakub Krupa has been keeping up with the latest developments following Donald Trump’s virtual meeting with European leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A few of the top lines are here: German chancellor Frederich Merz said that Trump “largely shares” the European position, and characterised the meeting as a “very good, constructive talk”. For his part Zelenskyy emphasised the importance of a trilateral meeting with Trump and Putin. He also confirmed that Trump said he would call him straight after the meeting with Putin to talk it through it. Meanwhile, Jakub reports that Nato secretary general Mark Rutte posted on social media, saying it was a “great call”, and emphasised Nato unity to end the war in Ukraine and “achieve just and lasting peace”. The president is considering 11 candidates to replace Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell when his terms ends in May, according to a report from CNBC. According to CNBC’s sources this long list includes three people who have not yet been mentioned publicly. Per CNBC these include: David Zervos, Jefferies chief market strategist, former Federal Reserve governor Larry Lindsey, and Rick Rieder, a chief investment officer at BlackRock. A reminder, that should Donald Trump replace Powell, his pick must be confirmed by the US Senate. An interesting news nugget today comes by way of writer Kyle Tharp – who writes the Chaotic Era newsletter. In his latest post, he finds that only three politicians have found much success in their podcast endeavors. Tharp’s reporting, which uses data from Podscribe, finds that Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas averaged more than 1.4m monthly downloads last month for his podcast The Verdict. Meanwhile, California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom and Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw managed to break more than 400,000 and 300,000 downloads for their respective shows. There’s a precipitous drop in average monthly downloads after that, according to Tharp. He reports that “more than two dozen leading elected officials” have attempted to host their own podcasts in recent years. Also today, we can expect to hear from Texas Democrats – who left the state over a week ago to deny quorum in protest of gerrymandered GOP-drawn maps. The legislators will join Indiana lawmakers as the Trump administration applies pressure on the Indiana governor Mike Braun to also redraw the state’s map. A reminder that yesterday, the Texas Senate approved a map that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said the House will adjourn until Friday, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time. If Friday’s attempt fails, Texas governor Greg Abbott said he’ll call a second session immediately. Rural communities are seeing a key aspect of life affected amid Trump’s immigration crackdown and Ice raids. Harrisonburg, Virginia, a town of 50,000 people in the Shenandoah Valley, should have been alive with the color, sound and smells of local Latino culture. Soccer tournaments, taco trucks, Salvadorian chanchona musical bands and about 4,000 visitors were last month set to attend the town’s Hispanic Festival held at a sports complex outside the town. But this year, it’s not happening. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents have been active in the Harrisonburg area for months, prompting organizers to cancel the festival. “There have been instances of raids targeting immigrant families and workplaces in the past. While we had no confirmed reports that Ice planned to target the festival, the general climate of fear is very real,” says Crimson Solano, executive director of the Coalición Solidaria Pro-Inmigrantes Unidos (COSPU), which runs the festival. “This fear undermines the purpose of the festival, which is to create a safe, celebratory space for our community.” Festivals and fairs are a mainstay of small-town American life. But now from rural Indiana to a tiny village in Washington state to cornerstone Appalachian towns such as Harrisonburg, Latino and other international festivals are being cancelled this summer due to fears of raids by Ice agents. Read more here: My colleagues will be bringing you the very latest developments on the president’s virtual meetings with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. You can follow along here As they noted, Donald Trump just praised his European counterparts as “great people who want to see a deal done”, in a post on Truth Social. The president has also undermined various reports that include critics of his upcoming meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Alaska. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that the “very unfair media” is “constantly quoting fired losers and really dump people like John Bolton”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Tuesday, the former national security adviser said: “Putin has already won. He is the leader of a rogue state, and he’ll get a picture on U.S. soil with the president of the United States.” Similarly, in an interview with CNN last week, Bolton said that the “initial set-up” for Friday’s summit is a “great victory for Putin”. But Trump wasted no time in the post calling out the press as “are sick and dishonest people, who probably hate our country”. We can expect to hear from Donald Trump at least a few times today. According to the president’s daily schedule, he’ll make an appearance at the Kennedy Center at 11am ET, and make an announcement. He’ll then head back to the White House and sign executive orders at 4pm ET. For now this will be closed press, but could very well open up. Donald Trump, ahead of his planned virtual meeting with European leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy later on Wednesday, praised Europe’s leaders in a post on social media and said they “want to see a deal done.” In a post on Truth Social, the president wrote: Will be speaking to European Leaders in a short while. They are great people who want to see a deal done. That was followed shortly after with another post, criticising the way his upcoming meeting with Putin has been portrayed in the media. Trump wrote: Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil, “Putin has already won.” What’s that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING. The Fake News is working overtime (No tax on overtime!). If I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal! But now they’ve been caught. Look at all of the real news that’s coming out about their CORRUPTION. They are sick and dishonest people, who probably hate our Country. But it doesn’t matter because we are winning on everything!!! MAGA For more on Trump’s calls with European leaders, follow our Europe live blog. Muriel Bowser last night hardened her stance on Donald Trump using federal agents to police the city, calling the president’s move an “authoritarian push”. Speaking during a live town hall on social media, the mayor of Washington DC urged community members to “protect our city, to protect our autonomy, to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push”. “We are not 700,000 scumbags and punks,” she added. “We don’t have neighborhoods that should be bulldozed. We have to be clear about our story, who we are and what we want for our city.” Bowser had previously pledged to work “side with side” with the federal officials Trump has tasked with overseeing the city’s law enforcement, while insisting the police chief remained in charge of the department and its officers. Speaking on Tuesday after a meeting with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, Bowser told reporters: “What I’m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have.” About 850 officers and agents took part in a “massive law enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and made nearly two dozen arrests, the White House has said. The violent crime rate in Washington DC is at a 30-year low. Trump’s intervention has been widely condemned as an authoritarian power grab that undermines the autonomy of Washington’s DC local government and seeks to distract attention from political problems such as the Jeffrey Epstein files. In May, the Arizona representative Yassamin Ansari toured a detention facility where immigrants rounded up as part of the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportation were being housed. She described what she saw inside as “sickening” and “worse than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in overcrowded, moldy cells and many reported that they did not have reliable access to food, water or medical care. Two months later, Ansari returned to the remote desert complex to conduct another congressional oversight visit. This time, she was denied entry. It wasn’t an isolated incident. From New York to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions – are being held. Democratic officials’ legislative checks – a legal right for members of Congress – have consistently confirmed reports that immigrant detainees are being kept in “filthy” and “inhumane” conditions with little regard for due process. Now, the facilities have become a battleground in the intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers over the president’s supercharged immigration agenda. “The administration’s goal is to intimidate us and bully us, bully us out of doing our jobs for sure,” congresswoman LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who has been accused of assaulting federal agents during a confrontation at the Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If they can get away with doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to anyone. But more importantly, imagine what they’re doing in the dark to others who are not of an elected status, who are not in public eye view.” McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month later, detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory wall – an act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and overcrowding. The closely watched New York mayoral and governor’s races appear to be forming into shapes that will bring little comfort to centrist Democrats, with elections happening in November this year in New York City and the gubernatorial vote a year later. A new Siena Institute poll released on Tuesday shows New York City’s Democratic socialist mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, leading former New York governor Andrew Cuomo by 19 percentage points – while the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik is chipping away at incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul’s lead in a hypothetical contest for the New York governor’s mansion in 2026. Hochul’s lead over Stefanik, who was nominated to be US ambassador to the United Nations before withdrawing to help Republicans maintain a majority in Congress, has now dropped from 23 points in June to 14 points. Stefanik has not officially decided on whether to seek the governor’s office, but she has been noticeably attacking Hochul’s record. The poll found that 49% of voters in the state said it would be bad for New York if Stefanik were elected governor. “The latest Siena poll is catastrophic for Kathy Hochul as she is losing independent voters to Elise Stefanik, is below 50% on the ballot, and only 35% of voters want to re-elect Kathy Hochul,” said Stefanik’s executive director Alex DeGrasse in a statement to the Guardian. He predicted voters are looking to Stefanik to deliver new leadership. California governor Gavin Newsom says the state will draw new electoral maps after Donald Trump “missed” a deadline on Tuesday night in an ongoing redistricting battle between Democratic and Republican states. “DONALD ‘TACO’ TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, ‘MISSED’ THE DEADLINE!!!”, Newsom’s office wrote on social media. “CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE ‘BEAUTIFUL MAPS,’ THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!)”. “BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM — YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR — THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR ‘MAGA.’ THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! — GN,” reads the post. The post follows a series of snarky, all-caps tweets meant to mimic Trump’s social media writing style. Newsom was mocking Trump’s moniker, “Taco”, short for “Trump always chickens out”, prompted by his flip-flopping deadlines. Several states have waded into the redistricting wars, where Newsom and other Democratic state leaders had threatened to draw retaliatory maps if Texas were to move ahead with its redistricting scheme. Donald Trump’s administration has significantly changed a key US government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president, such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have well-established histories of abuses. Instead, the US state department sounded an alarm about what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues. Criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”. The report’s section on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is likely to meet Donald Trump during a visit to the US next month to attend the UN General Assembly meeting, the Indian Express newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian official familiar with the matter said a decision has not yet been taken, and that countries usually reserve slots for the general debate at the assembly, which is why India’s “head of government” features in a provisional list of speakers on 26 September. A US judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to restore a part of the federal grant funding that it recently suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles. US district judge Rita Lin in San Francisco ruled that the grant funding suspensions violated an earlier June preliminary injunction where she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore dozens of grants that it had terminated at the University of California. That order had blocked the agency from cancelling other grants at the University of California system, of which UCLA is a part. “NSF’s actions violate the Preliminary Injunction,” Lin, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, wrote. The White House and the university had no immediate comment on the ruling. UCLA said last week the government froze $584m in funding. Trump has threatened to cut federal funds for universities over pro-Palestinian student protests against US ally Israel’s military assault on Gaza. The Los Angeles Times newspaper reported that the judge’s order asked for the restoration of more than a third of the suspended $584m funding. The University of California said last week it was reviewing a settlement offer by the Trump administration for UCLA in which the university will pay $1bn. It said such a large payment would “devastate” the institution. The government alleges universities, including UCLA, allowed antisemitism during the protests. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news. We start with the news that Donald Trump will be visiting the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, the same day that the recipients of this year’s honors are announced. Trump avoided the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term after artists said they would not attend out of protest. This year, he has taken over as the Kennedy Center‘s new chair and fired the board of trustees, which he replaced with loyalists. In a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump teased a name change for the performing arts center and said it would be restored to its former glory, AP reported. “GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump wrote. He said work was being done on the site that would be “bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. It is unclear how this year’s batch of honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role. Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin and Stephen Sondheim. A message sent to the Kennedy Center press office asking how this year’s honorees were selected wasn’t returned Tuesday. The Kennedy Center did post this on social media, however: “Coming Soon ... A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...” In other developments: The DC national guard began deploying on the city’s streets Tuesday night, a day after Trump ordered their arrival and took control of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city, despite official crime statistics saying otherwise. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to immediately improve conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility, acting on mounting complaints from detainees that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. The Texas Senate approved a GOP-drawn congressional map that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said the House will adjourn until Friday, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time. Trump is due to speak with European leaders, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, today ahead of Friday’s meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt characterised Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin as a “listening exercise” for the president, confirming that Zelenskyy would not be in attendance, but the president has hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future. For more on the upcoming meeting, follow our Europe live blog here. California governor Gavin Newsom says the state will draw new electoral maps after Trump “missed” a deadline on Tuesday night in an ongoing redistricting battle between Democratic and Republican states. The Trump administration is evidently extending its control of cultural representation at the Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum and research complex. In a letter posted on the White House website, the administration told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of the US’s 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026.
