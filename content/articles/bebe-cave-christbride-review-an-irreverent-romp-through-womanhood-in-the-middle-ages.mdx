  Bebe Cave: Christbride review – an irreverent romp through womanhood in the
  middle ages

  One of the great characters in recent live comedy is Rosalie Minnitt’s
  Clementine, a send-up of Jane Austen-era femininity who is also wickedly
  relevant to young women’s lives today. That persona leapt frilly bonneted to
  mind when I watched Bebe Cave’s Christbride, which likewise plays fast and
  loose with anachronism and history – in this case, the middle ages – to
  explore women’s lives in days gone by. Cave’s venture isn’t quite as
  successful: fun though her story is, Batilda Bigbum – as the cartoonish name
  indicates – feels less a fully realised character than an excuse for her
  creator to goon around lovably. It makes for an interesting counterpoint to
  Cave’s solo theatre show The Screen Test, which showcased her comic and
  performing talents while concealing its creator behind a disciplined character
  and script. This time, madcap Bebe bursts out from behind her 14th-century
  alter ego (“I’m not like the other maidens!”) and clowns around at the
  slightest prompting, all while orchestrating the busy tale of her heroine’s
  failed courtship, flight to a nunnery, then eventual burning (no spoilers –
  it’s how the show starts) as a witch. There is a lot going on, little of it
  performed with a light touch – but it is easy to sit back and be steamrollered
  by Cave’s cascading creativity and overflowing sense of fun. You want bawdy
  Catholic comedy? Cave’s got wet dreams with a scouse Jesus and: “Nothing makes
  me moister than a cloister.” You want feminist not-so-subtext? As our
  insufficiently passive protagonist is reminded: “Men don’t like women who are
  people.” There are also frantic set and hat changes, three fellow nuns with
  wide-ranging accents, body popping, shadow play, and a tangential flash
  forward to a history class taught in the present day. Cave’s interest in the
  period, and sympathy for the women marooned there, shines through all this
  in-yer-face fooling around – even if a grinding gear-change is required to
  accommodate her explanation of holy visions and how they work: “What we feel
  is real.” If that sounds like women carving out a little power for themselves,
  Batilda soon reaches its limits in this uproarious, unruly comedy. At
