  You know what they say. If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the drug
  smuggling across the Sahara racket. Alas, these are wise words that young
  cartel driver Max (Alfie Allen, bringing exactly the reckless high energy the
  character and venture require) has failed to heed. We first meet him speeding
  across the Algerian portion of the north African desert with a companion
  called Carlos (Nezar Thalal) on their way to Beirut to exchange a great deal
  of cocaine for some antique statues, when bish, bash, wallop, what’s
  happening?! An ambush by a militant group armed with machine guns who kill
  Carlos and are about to kill Max? But then one of the group turns on the
  others and kills all of them stone dead instead, before flinging Max and the
  coke in the car and hightailing it out of there? That is what’s happening!
  Goodness me and welcome to the first 37 seconds of Atomic, a five-part
  miniseries you shouldn’t expect to let up any time soon. Max’s rescuer is
  averse to providing his real name so Max calls him JJ – short for “Jihadi
  John”. If this offends anyone’s delicate sensibilities I think you should have
  left 37 seconds ago. JJ reroutes them to Benghazi for unspecified reasons. Max
  can hope to return to his original plans thereafter. Meanwhile, we trot over
  to other parts of the globe, including the Caucasus mountains in Russia, where
  an oligarch’s fearsome daughter Oksana Shirokova (Avital Lvova) is sending a
  brace of boxes via some reluctant mule herders to Beirut. She adds that they
  and the unspecified contents (“To you they’re statues”) being smuggled out of
  the nuclear state must be kept two metres apart at all times. The mule herders
  look even more reluctant. The astute viewer notes anew the title of the series
  and nods sagely. For the first episode or two you worry that it’s all going to
  be too much. To the multiple locations and destinations, potential heroes and
  villains are added a cartel riad in Marrakech, flashbacks to JJ in Syria, an
  American university in Beirut where Samira Wiley is Dr Cassie Elliott, an
  unusually well-armed lecturer in physics, a set of corrupt gendarmes, a gang
  of military types led by a very angry Scotsman, Rab Makintosh (Stuart Martin),
  the father of one of the murdered militants, a lost young boy (Keni
  Emmanuelle, heartbreaking in a wordless part), the CIA, and Max’s beloved
  girlfriend Laetitia (Charlie Murphy) and Brian Gleeson as Dr Elliott’s boss,
  Mark, and a few more. Fortunately, just as you are starting to feel that if
  there is one more piece of information thrown at you it is going to push the
  entire mass out of your head, the flood of new things stops and the plot
  starts to tighten and deepen. JJ’s mysterious backstory is filled in and his
  motives are complicated at every turn. Banter with Max gradually gives way to
  bonding as the pair realise they are caught up in no ordinary cartel deal with
  no ordinary cargo at its heart. The suspense never lets up as they are pursued
  across numerous territories in a variety of vehicles and with a variety of
  weapons trained on them, sometimes by those with personal grudges against
  them, sometimes by those who merely want to murder them for their increasingly
  grubby rucksacks and the volatile things inside them (uranium, OK? It’s
  uranium. I don’t know why I’m trying so hard to keep it a secret), but the
  increasing emotional stakes are raised as we go. The violence is frequent but
  – especially for all those who are still in the process of recovering from the
  harrowing, seemingly endless scenes in The Narrow Road to the Deep North –
  mercifully cartoonish. The questions that it asks about what it means to live
  a good life, how people pervert religions, seek redemption or justify taking
  revenge come increasingly to the fore and add an unexpected heft to the whole,
  though it can still be enjoyed as a breakneck, Guy-Ritchie-esque
  drug-caper-cum-buddy-movie, if you want. But Atomic brings with it that
  ineffable pleasure caused by watching something that someone took just one or
  two extra passes over, to give its audience an experience just a bit better
  than you were expecting, just that bit better than it needed to be. • Atomic
  aired on Sky Max and is on Now in the UK and on Binge in Australia
