  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed the decision to offer security guarantees to
  Ukraine as part of a peace deal as he prepared to meet Donald Trump in
  Washington on Monday. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work,
  must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air and
  at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation,” said the Ukrainian
  president. Trump’s Ukraine envoy, the real estate developer Steve Witkoff,
  said Vladimir Putin had agreed that the US and European allies could offer
  Ukraine a Nato-style, “Article 5-like” security guarantee as part of an
  eventual deal to end the war. It appeared to be a major shift for Putin, but
  Witkoff has previously got it wrong when announcing what has been agreed in
  talks with the Russians – he does not speak Russian and has walked into
  meetings with Vladimir Putin without a translator of his own. Russia agrees
  that any future peace agreement on Ukraine must provide security guarantees to
  Kyiv but Moscow also needs credible security assurances, Mikhail Ulyanov,
  Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday.
  “Many leaders of EU states emphasise that a future peace agreement should
  provide reliable security assurances or guarantees for Ukraine,” Ulyanov said.
  “Russia agrees with that. But it has equal right to expect that Moscow will
  also get efficient security guarantees.” Russia has not been invaded by
  another country since the end of the second world war – apart from the
  humiliating Ukrainian counter-invasion of Kursk – while having repeatedly
  invaded other countries and illegally annexed their territory. European
  heavyweight leaders will join Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House meeting
  with Trump on Monday, writes Luke Harding, in an extraordinary joint effort to
  push back on a US-backed plan that would allow Russia to take further
  Ukrainian territory. They are expected to argue against a land swap plan that
  rewards Russian aggression, and to seek further clarity on what security
  guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement. The
  delegation includes the French president, Emmanuel Macron; Germany’s
  chancellor, Friedrich Merz; Italy’s PM, Giorgia Meloni; Keir Starmer, the
  British PM; Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte; the European Commission
  president, Ursula von der Leyen; and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb.
  In a CBS interview after the Trump-Putin talks in Alaska, Marco Rubio, the US
  secretary of state, gave short shrift to the Russian ruler’s “long historical
  complaint” that “root causes” of the Ukraine war must be addressed as part of
  a peace deal. “We’re not going to focus on all of that stuff. We’re going to
  focus on this: are they going to stop fighting or not? And what it’s going to
  take to stop the fighting.” Rubio continued: “If we’re being honest and
  serious here, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should
  expect to get something from this. And that’s a very difficult thing to do …
  Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they
  were invaded. And the Russian side, because they feel like they got momentum
  in the battlefield, and frankly, don’t care, don’t seem to care very much
  about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavour.” Dan Sabbagh writes
  that Rubio gave the inbound European delegation some hope, insisting to NBC
  that a ceasefire is “not off the table” – despite Putin insisting it can only
  come after a complete peace deal – and confirming that the US is interested in
  contributing to western security guarantees to Ukraine. “It’s one of their
  fundamental demands is that if this war were to end, they have to make sure
  this never happens again.” The US secretary of state is a traditional
  Republican whose instincts towards Russia are hawkish, although he has a
  record of going with the flow when it comes to the president’s impulses.
  Russian attacks on Ukraine continued over Sunday night. A missile strike on
  Kharkiv city injured 11 people, said Kharkiv’s mayor. A guided bomb strike on
  a Sumy oblast community left a woman injured, said the head of the regional
  military administration, while civilian facilities were damaged in a series of
  attacks.
