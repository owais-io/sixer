  A new party has launched in the UK, and it didn’t take long for it to become
  the subject of frantic speculation. Will it split the left? Will it create
  more of an opening for Reform UK? Should it forge an alliance with the Greens?
  The stunning speed with which Jeremy Corbyn’s new party amassed supporters,
  now standing at 600,000 in a week, reasonably makes it feel like a real and
  viable thing. And the next logical step is to assess its chances in
  meaningfully challenging the mainstream. But the bigger question is, can the
  mainstream be meaningfully challenged, or is the future one of increasing
  fragmentation, with a persistent but tense monopoly on power by the political
  establishment? The signs that the centre is fraying at the margins became
  clear at the last general election. There was a historically low turnout by
  share of the population (resulting in the most disproportionate election
  outcome in history), Labour won its lowest share of the vote among those in
  deprived areas, and up came a new crop of independent MPs and Reform winners.
  Since then, the already “broad but shallow” mandate given to Labour has
  diminished even more, with approval ratings dropping the most for any
  governing party within its first year since John Major’s disaster in the
  1990s. And internally, a raft of suspensions over the welfare reform bill
  continue to expose a party struggling even to maintain satisfaction within its
  own ranks. This is not a stable state of affairs, but it could very likely be
  a sustainable one. Because even as establishments rot and lose public support,
  they still benefit from scale and deep roots within the governing and
  electoral system – there’s a reason it’s called an “establishment”. Combine
  this with no proportional representation, and you have a situation where
  numbers do not necessarily translate into seats. Cycling between two
  mainstream parties, both out of ideas and solutions for everything from the
  cost of living to foreign policy, has led to a state of repetitive
  disaffection. The story in the US is the same. The Democrats were rejected for
  a second time in eight years in favour of Donald Trump, but Trump himself is
  now posting the lowest approval rating of his second term. Neither centrists
  nor rightwingers can deliver, and yet their parties squat and sprawl on the
  site of government, with high barriers to entry precluding outside challenge
  and disincentivising internal reform. This is a recipe for permanent
  disconnect; failing governments, angry protest movements on the right and the
  left, quirky election results – and no change. Those individuals who break
  through, from Zohran Mamdani in New York to independent MPs in the UK, instead
  of alerting the parties they are closest to that the political net must be
  widened, are in fact actively fought against. The most senior Democrats in the
  House of Representatives have still not endorsed Mamdani. And why would they
  if they can stay in their political comfort zone, then win again on their own
  terms when the disenchantment with Trump kicks in proper, and the cycle
  resets? In the meantime, the sort of vexation that coalesces around figures
  such as Mamdani and the UK’s new party means that they inherit a gigantic
  burden of expectation. It is one that is impossible to fulfil, because
  frustration with mainstream parties is so high that new ones, unless they
  become constant foghorns channeling feelings of anger rather than political
  projects, will have to constantly manage being the voice of outrage against
  the government, as well as working out how to be the alternative. Adding to
  the clamouring appetite for sharp challenge is a new information ecosystem
  where there are now more ways to dispute mainstream accounts of political
  reality. The process of fragmentation combined with persistent monopoly is one
  that is mirrored in the media. Over the past two years alone, entire outlets
  have grown and flourished over what it seems is the media’s inability to
  adequately capture and express anger over Gaza. From Zeteo (dubbed a “breakout
  hit”) to Drop Site News, which launched only a year ago, now has almost
  400,000 subscribers and closely works with journalists in Gaza, there is a
  vast appetite for more uncompromising discourse and intimate coverage of the
  Middle East and complicity on Gaza. Still, this has not diminished anger at
  mainstream outlets because it is understood that these organisations still
  have enormous reach and therefore power over public opinion, and by extension
  political outcomes. It is why the New York Times’s reports on starvation in
  Gaza have been heavily contested by pro-Israeli government voices, as the
  paper holds huge authority in the one country that has power over Israel. But
  all that residual power, from politics to the media, does not change the fact
  that something big is up for grabs – the default belief that these
  establishment institutions deserve their power, whether it can be taken away
  from them or not. Talk about new leftwing movements empowering Reform or the
  threat to the Labour government (talk that we have been hearing since before
  the last general election) misses the broader point – it’s too late. Labour is
  running on inertia, legacy, and historical and physical entrenchment, rather
  than active belief in the party. It has long given up on shaping public
  opinion, rather following, headless, what cynical politicians have forged, and
  economic and geopolitical realities have created. It is now a mutant party
  that is chasing Reform voters by trying (and failing) to outflank Nigel
  Farage, while trying to win over pro-Gaza opinion with a bizarre threat to
  recognise Palestine if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire. As well as trying
  to continue austerity while putting out the fires that it causes. There are
  two ways in which new parties and movements can produce results. The first is
  by actually being in government, and the second is by gathering enough support
  that they can apply pressure on government. The second is a more immediate and
  tangible way forward, but the problem is that the scale and range of what
  incumbent parties have failed to address, or take control of, is now too wide
  and polarised for any outside pressure to create breakthrough. The risk now is
  of a sort of permanent bifurcation. On the one hand, increasingly
  out-of-control hysteria on immigration empowers ghouls like Farage and makes
  them and their poisonous rhetoric permanent features of our lives and
  politics, while rage over Gaza and economic policies constantly clouds the
  political atmosphere. On the other, a government is caught in the headlights,
  unable to tackle anything, while also hoping that it’s too big to fail and its
  opponents too small and diverse to succeed. What if the problem isn’t that the
  centre cannot hold, but that it can, and in doing so brings about a new,
  volatile, miserable status quo of escalating rage and impotent government?
