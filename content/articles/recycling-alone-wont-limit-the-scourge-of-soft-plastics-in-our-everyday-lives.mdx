  It remains one of the biggest questions facing environmentally conscious
  consumers: how to stop the seemingly endless stream of soft plastics entering
  our daily lives? And, with the news that 94% of soft plastics are still ending
  up in landfill in Australia, the question is more pertinent than ever.
  Australia joined more than 100 countries pushing for a global plastics treaty
  to reduce pollution during the lifecycle of plastics products. But global
  progress appears to have stalled. So what can households and individuals do to
  reduce soft plastic waste in the meantime? Getting industry to take
  responsibility Last week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
  announced its support for a new industry-led scheme to collect and recycle
  soft plastic packaging from consumers, backed by major supermarkets and food
  giants including Mars and Nestlé, in an attempt to replace REDcycle which
  collapsed in 2022. A spokesperson from the Australian Packaging Covenant
  Organisation (APCO), the organisation charged with leading the development of
  a circular economy for packaging in Australia, says the new scheme has merit
  because it encourages better practices by making producers financially
  responsible for their products’ environmental impacts. “A national Extended
  Producer Responsibility scheme in Australia would shift responsibility for the
  end-of-life management of products (like packaging) from governments and
  consumers to producers,” the spokesperson says. Tara Jones, plastics and
  packaging program manager at the Australian Marine Conservation Society
  (AMCS), says while the new scheme is welcome, recycling alone won’t solve the
  problem. “Data from around the world tells us the more plastic that gets
  produced, the more plastic ends up polluting our environment.” What can
  households do? When it comes to limiting the scourge of soft plastics in our
  everyday lives, the age-old mantra of reduce, reuse and recycle still holds
  true – reducing the amount of plastics we use, reusing plastic bags where
  possible and recycling as best we can. Birte Moliere, packaging product
  stewardship lead for the Boomerang Alliance, says consumers need to reimagine
  their relationship with packaging, as we won’t be able to recycle our way out
  of the huge amount of plastic packaging currently being produced. That means
  more support for reuse and refill nationally. “We strongly encourage consumers
  to purchase items without single-use plastic. Australia is still the second
  largest per capita consumer of single-use plastics in the world, our per
  capita use is excessive, with much packaging completely unnecessary,” she
  says. “Consider alternatives to plastic, such as reusable glass containers for
  food takeaways or beeswax paper instead of cling wrap,” the APCO spokesperson
  says. “Think about opportunities to re-use existing plastic, rather than using
  new. For example, if you have used a plastic bag for your shopping, take this
  with you next time instead of buying a new one, or the reuse of plastic
  takeout containers.” Where plastic is unavoidable, Australasian Recycling
  Label offers advice and maps about where to find soft plastic recycling
  programs. Some local councils now accept soft plastic drop-off at recycling
  locations, while others are offering kerbside collection. Selected
  supermarkets are trialling in-store collection. Consumers can keep the
  pressure on While supermarkets have been making changes in recent years, such
  as no longer offering free plastic bags at the checkout, they are still
  blocking real progress to eliminate plastic packaging. According to a 2024
  supermarket audit conducted in partnership with AMCS, Australia’s major
  supermarkets refuse to disclose how much plastic they are responsible for,
  while effectively penalising shoppers trying to avoid plastic bags, with loose
  fruit and vegetables more expensive than their plastic wrapped counterparts in
  73% of cases. “As individuals, we can take action by avoiding single-use
  packaging where possible, such as buying produce loose and using reusable
  containers and bags, but often we don’t have the choice,” says Jones from
  AMCS. “Many grocery items at the big supermarkets aren’t available without
  unnecessary plastic packaging.” While supermarkets continue to prioritise
  recycling over the removal of plastic and stop short of providing plastic
  alternatives to many products on their shelves, Jones says one of the best
  actions we can do as individual consumers is keep up the pressure on
  supermarkets to drop their plastics addiction. “Businesses need to take
  accountability and reduce plastic pollution at the source by eliminating
  problematic, unnecessary and excessive plastic packaging.”
