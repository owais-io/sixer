  Five more bankers convicted of rigging interest rates may be a step closer to
  clearing their names after the supreme court overturned a decade-old ruling
  against the trader Tom Hayes last month. The Serious Fraud Office said it had
  assessed the cases of six individuals who were charged with manipulating the
  euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) or the now defunct London interbank
  offered rate (Libor) and determined that five convictions “may be considered
  unsafe” after July’s ruling. Both Euribor and Libor rates affected the value
  of hundreds of trillions of pounds and euros worth of financial products
  around the world, including ordinary people’s pensions, mortgages and savings.
  The SFO’s investigations, which were launched 13 years ago, resulted in nine
  fraud convictions against senior bankers, including Hayes, who had been
  accused of rigging the rates. But Hayes, who was the first banker jailed over
  Libor rigging in 2015, had his name cleared in July after the supreme court
  found faults in the original trial. The court said the original judge had
  given “inaccurate and unfair” instructions to the jury that found him guilty
  on charges of conspiracy to defraud. This meant the former banker was
  ultimately deprived of a fair trial. The supreme court simultaneously quashed
  the conviction of Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays trader who was sentenced to
  four years in prison in 2019 for rigging Euribor. The SFO said it had a duty,
  as a prosecutor, to inform past defendants about any developments that could
  affect their convictions. “We consider that, in five instances, the
  circumstances that led to Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo’s appeals being upheld
  by the supreme court could apply to them too.” It said the court’s concerns
  about directions given to the jury in the original trial may also apply to the
  former Barclays bankers Jonathan Mathew, Jay Merchant, Alex Pabon, Philippe
  Moryoussef and Colin Bermingham, who were each handed jail sentences of
  between four and eight years. “Therefore, their convictions may be considered
  unsafe,” the SFO said. “For one individual, Peter Johnson, we have considered
  the judgment in respect of his guilty plea and we consider that the conviction
  is safe,” it added. The SFO said it was now up to each defendant to consider
  whether they wanted to take their case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission
  or the court of appeal. Commenting on the SFO’s statement, Hayes said: “It’s
  taken 10 years for the SFO to acknowledge the continued failures in the Ibor
  trials. As a result, many people spent years in prison.” Hayes raised concerns
  about the SFO’s view of Johnson’s case and that of a former Deutsche Bank
  trader, Christian Bittar. “Even now with this acknowledgment, the SFO
  continues to prolong the agony of Peter Johnson and Christian Bittar by
  refusing to accept that they too were the victims of a flawed case in law that
  is not acknowledged as a crime anywhere else globally,” he said.
