  And with that hopeful image, I shall take my leave of you. Ewan Murray’s
  report will be up soon, so do check back for that, but otherwise, enjoy the
  rest of the weekend and peace out. Jorge Valdano described the Liverpool v
  Chelsea Champions League semi of 2005 as “a shit hanging from a stick”. This
  game made the stick aspect look redemptive. Also going on: Just under way: “I
  guess we can see why the Old Firm teams failed to qualify for the Champions
  League,” writes Stephen Grundy. “The quality is very poor. And as a Rangers
  fan, I am gutted that Martin will survive this game and we will probably lose
  Raskin.” We’re just insufficiently cultured to appreciate Martin’s vision. All
  will soon reveal itself. Was that the worst Old Firm game ever played? No
  class, no imagination and no redemptive misbehaviour. Both sides have huge
  problems. A match so miserable Morrissey might one day write a song about it.
  Four draws in four for Rangers, who vault above Livingston from seventh to
  sixth; Celtic move top, above Hearts on goal difference. 90+3 min Cdltic are
  lucky they didn’t play the second-best team in Kazakhstan; Rangers were
  flattered by 6-0 in Bruges. 90+2 min Diomande crosses and Carter-Vickers heads
  clear. That could easily make the highlights. 90 min We’ll have three
  additional minutes. Which, on the plus side, is better than four. 90 min I
  wonder how two aesthetes as committed as Martin and Rodgers will explain away
  this stinking mess. I reckon both will think it not their fault. 88 min Change
  for Celtic: McCowan for Hatate. 87 min Maeda gets in front of Bajrami, who
  wants a penalty; nothing doing. Then Djiga hurtles into Shin and is booked. 85
  min A silly foul allows Tavernier to swing over yet another dead ball; Hatate
  head behind for yet another corner. This time, he picks out the man defending
  the near post, and Celtic clear once more. I can’t remember the last game I
  saw of such inspirational awfulness. 83 min Bajrami moves down the left and
  wins a corner off Ralston and Tavernier swings into the near post, nice and
  flat, but Celtic clear, counter, and Diomande makes an important challenge. 82
  min “The Dundee derby will be better, that’s a cast iron (Guardian)
  guarantee™️,” returns Simon McMahon. “If you can watch it, please do. As long
  you’re a United supporter, of course.” 80 min Nygren moves through midfield,
  spreads left, and a foul from Gassama means Celtic have a free-kick. But not
  before Rangers make another two changes, Rothwell replacing the injured Barron
  and Curtis on for Gassama. 77 min Schmeichel clips a dangerous pass to Scales,
  who does pretty well to kill it. That could have been dangerous, which makes
  it a highlight. 75 min Another change for Rangers: Bajrami replaces Aasgaard,
  who looks to have taken a knock. 74 min How many different ways can we find of
  saying how bad this is? Well, Made in America was better. 72 min Two changes
  for Rangers, Dessers and Antman replacing Miovski and Moore, while Celtic give
  Saracchi a debut, in place of Tierney. 71 min Better from Celtic, Forrest
  sliding a really good ball in behind for Shin … but he can’t quite take it
  into his stride so it runs away. 70 min Celtic win a corner down the left,
  their first of the match, and Nygren picks out Moore on the edge, who clears.
  Great stuff. 68 min Oooh, with Butland about to collect a ball and nae
  pressure, Djiga humps it out of play; naturally, Celtic give it straight back.
  67 min Diomande is late on Ralston and booked – for persistent fouling, not
  the offence itself. 67 min Forrest will, I imagine, look to run at Meghoma,
  but can Celtic get him the ball in space? 65 min Two changes for Celtic,
  Yamada and Forrest replacing Engels and Balikwisha. 64 min Nygren teases in,
  McGregor bundles back across, and someone, Maeda I think, heads goalwards …
  but Butland saves easily. 63 min Another poor corner is cleared, then Celtic
  counter and Moore slides in late on Nygren; he’s booked. Free-kick, left of
  centre, 30 yards out. 61 min Miovski pin Scales, knowing if he can get to the
  ball first, the foul will come. That’s exactly what happens and Tavernier will
  swing in the free-kick … which is cleared. But the ball comes back, Aasgaard
  lofting over the top for Miovski, who might go for goal but instead heads back
  across, and Celtic put it behind. 60 min Engels to Hatate, just outside the
  box, and he sweeps a low shot that, though too close to Butland, is Celtic’s
  first shot on target. 58 min A long ball over the top seeking Milovski, again,
  Scales heads behind, and again, the corner comes to nothing. Rangers, at
  least, are trying to make something happen; I’ve not a clue what Celtic’s plan
  is. 57 min A match likely to contain some actual football. 56 min Diomande
  hauls Engels down in centrefield, well off the ball, and does well to avoid a
  booking. 55 min Nygren picks up a loose ball, 25 yards out, and lamps way over
  the top. 53 min Excellent from Gassama, who goes at Tierney, bounces him away
  from the ball, and crosses low … but Scales, who’s actually played OK, taking
  responsibility for protecting his penalty area, stretches to deflect to
  safety. 53 min “As a football fan in California,” says Mary Waltz, “of course
  I set the alarm for zero dark thirty for the Old Firm, the passion, one of the
  greatest derbies in world football, right? And the only struggle I am
  witnessing is my own struggle to stay awake. I can only consume so much
  coffee.” It’s just about to explode… 52 min Celtic take a quick free-kick down
  the left, then Hatate crosses straight to Butland. 51 min A visual
  representation of Celtic’s performance: 50 min Aagaard looks to spread for
  Diomande … but needlessly gives a simple pass way too much. That’s where we
  are. 48 min I guess a draw isn’t a bad result for Celtic, but so far their
  performance has been rotten. As I type, Tierney is in quickly to hoof away
  Meghoma’s cross, and I guess they’ve defended the box in reasonable fashion,
  but everything else has been of the lowest standard imaginable. 47 min But
  this is a little bit better, Moore zipping in from the left, across the face
  of the Celtic defence, before leathering a shot well over the bar. 47 min
  Meghoma into Moore … whose first touch goes into touch. 46 min We go again.
  Back come wa teams. Will either of them do anything? Celtic, we’re told,
  aren’t making any changes at the break. I don’t think it’ll be long, though,
  if they don’t improve quickly. Half-time entertainment: a read on one of the
  most ridiculous football stories there is. A devastatingly despicable half of
  football. Rangers were by far the better team despite creating almost nothing;
  the least said about Celtic the better. 45+4 min Celtic spread to Balikwisha,
  again he crosses when he might go at his man, and Rangers clear. 45+2 min “So
  far as I can tell, the two cheeks are jointly playing some of the
  lower-quality Premiership football this season,” writes James Humphries. :Hibs
  have looked great and had a good go at Europe, the Jambos have been
  entertaining and of course the mighty Well have done everything except
  actually win a game with our lovely possession football. It’s actually a
  really good season so far! Long may the travails of the Big Clubs continue
  (and yes I know there’s a wider conversation about Scottish football to be had
  here), but commiserations you have to watch what sounds like the worst game of
  the weekend.” I’m enjoying it. So bad it’s good dreadful, which is, of course,
  an enduring charm of the beautiful game. 45 min We’ll have four additional
  minutes and Diomande begins them by escaping Nygren down the left. He crosses,
  and Celtic clear. 43 min This time, Barron takes it, and again, Celtic clear.
  They still, though, can’t get the ball forward. 42 min There’s a break in play
  as Maeda receives attention for an inadvertent frask in pisk; when it resumes,
  Tavernier swings over a free-kick from the right, which goes behind for a
  corner. 40 min Rangers have been the better side, such that there is one,
  dominating territory. It looks like each side has 67 players on the pitch,
  each of them wearing diving boots. 39 min Tavernier trips over his own feet,
  Balikwisha collects, and crosses to naebody. So far, he’s fitting in
  perfectly. 35 min The cross from Tavernier was the only moment of quality
  we’ve seen so far today. It’s a long time since I watched so poor a game,
  which is not to say the fare is unenjoyable. But it’d be interesting to see
  some football at some point. I baulk at saying this, but I don’t think anyone,
  not even Rangers fans, can argue that Souttar wasn’t offside. The evidence is
  clear. 33 min I think he was, you know – he went just a little early, leaning
  ahead of the line, and though it was a good header I don’t think this is going
  to count. 33 min But was Souttar offside? This time, the delivery is spot-on,
  curling in, and Souttar races in to head past Schmeichel, who races out to get
  nowhere near the ball. 32 min Ralston concedes a free-kick for a cramp
  football-style foul – that’s a harsh call – on Aasgaard, and Tavernier has a
  third chance to flight a telling ball into the box… 30 min “Evie and Ryan were
  in Luxembourg and Vienna,” returns Simon McMahon, “they’re proper diehards.
  Derby day is like no other, and thankfully we don’t have the baggage that the
  Glasgow teams do, will be having a pint with my Dundee-supporting friends
  after the game, win, lose or draw. But as a United fan, as I think Cloughie
  once said, I don’t care how you do it, just win.” One thing, by the way, the
  Dundee sides share: blinding mid-80s kits. 29 min But this is slightly better,
  Aasgaard sliding in behind for Tavernier, whose cut-back is kicked behind by
  Scales. The resultant corner comes to nowt. 27 min Even for an Old Firm game,
  this is chaotic and basic. Neither side has yet to demonstrate anything beyond
  chasing, but Tvernier has another chance to put a ball into the box from a
  free-kick … and picks out Carter-Vickers. 25 min One of the things I enjoy
  about Ibrox is that everyone is stood up, all around the ground. Old Trafford
  was like that in the 70s, and 80s, with terraces on all four sides, and Elland
  Road still does a pretty good job on good days. The football, such as it is,
  remains of an agricultural nature. 23 min A bit of Celtic possession, as
  aimless as all that’s preceded it. But Nygren then wriggles a bit of room,
  Ralston crosses … and picks out Butland. 21 min He looks for the far side of
  the box and a knock across, but the flag goes up and Celtic clear. 20 min
  Moore moves through midfield but, with no one ahead of him, he has to turn
  back to Diomande. So Rangers build again, Tavernier into Aasgaard, central and
  40 yards out; he wins a free-kick and the Rangers captain will stick a ball
  into the box. 19 min Gassama moves down the right, but Tierney stands him up
  and sees him away. 17 min Engels flips out to Balikwisha, whose cross is
  headed clear. That was a chance to attack Meghoma, but he took the
  conservative option. 17 min I’ve seen more quality in a box of Roses. 16 min
  Celtic slow it down, looking to bait the press and build with three at the
  back, but Rangers allow them to halfway before engaging, forcing them back to
  the keeper. 14 min Moore burrows down the left but can’t find space; he’ll
  never have experienced anything like this, which is exactly why Spurs sent him
  here. I’m not sure he’ll get much done driving into traffic: Rangers need to
  build elsewhere, then switch it to him when he’s in space. 12 min Gassama
  looks to attack the heart of the Celtic defence; McGregor unloads him
  quicksmart. It feels like the teams are being controlled by kids on a Sunny D
  buzz, having had no sleep for a week. 11 min Again, the ball goes into the
  heart of the box, and this time Scales heads behind. When the corner comes in,
  he flicks away, and the ball ends up with Butland. 10 min …and a nervous
  Hatate heads behind. Rangers are building a little bit of pressure, but Maeda
  heads Barron’s corner clear, then when he goes again, Scales concedes a throw.
  So Tavernier crosses to the left and will go again. 9 min There is, as yet, no
  pattern to this game; it’s more of a scribble. But Rangers win a throw deep
  inside the Celtic half and Tavernier will hurl long… 7 min Diomande sweeps a
  decent ball wide and Aasgaard sticks Miovski in behind, down the right. He
  looks to have got in behind Scales, goal-side and just inside the box; he goes
  does at the first hint of contact, demanding a penalty, but there’s nothing
  doing. 5 min Ralston shoves Diomande, who walks off with the ball after
  conceding a throw, then Rangers try knocking it about at the back; they’re
  quickly pressed into going long. 4 min It’s frenetic early doors, Rangers
  looking to get about McGregor and there are wild cheers as Aasgaard gets into
  Tierney deep inside the Celtic half, but they immediately regain possession
  then clear via throw. 2 min “Looking forward to this", writes Simon McMahon,
  but of course the real game of the day in Scotland takes place immediately
  after this one, as Dundee United and Jim Goodwin’s Tangerine Army walk up the
  road to face Dundee at Dens. I’m sending this now as I’m currently at
  hospitality in Tannadice with Evie and Ryan before making the short walk with
  3,500 fellow Arabs. United have been ravaged by injury during the early part
  of the season and remain without Ryan Strain, Kristian Trapanovski, Ross
  Graham, Isaac Pappoe, Zac Sapsford and Max Watters, but new signing Nikolaj
  Moller is available. Having lost the last two derbies, unluckily in the
  Scottish Cup at Dens back in January, and not unluckily in the league at
  Tannadice in March, United will be desperate to win. But so will Dundee, who
  have not won consecutive league derbies in over 20 years. So it’s all to play
  for. May the best team United win. By a shedload.” My mate went to Luxembourg
  the other week, and the papers took an interest… 1 min And away we go! Ibrox
  is jumping, Simply the Best pumping over the PA. i’m hoping Chris Eubank will
  now vault the rope. Our teams are tunnelled … and here they come! Martin says
  today will tell him plenty about where the team are a s a group. He wants them
  to be brave on the ball. He’s also really happy to have Miovski in, likewise
  the freshness and excitement of Moore. On Raskin, he says no decision he makes
  is about him or a particular player but whatever’s best for the team in that
  moment. He wants his players to better than every department than they were in
  midweek, and he’s excited to see how it goes. I know Celtic have kept five
  clean sheets already this season, but I’m not totally convinced by their
  centre-backs. Miovski has the pace and agility to trouble Scales and
  Carter-Vickers, while Moore has the pace, skill and short backlift to zip in
  off the flank and worry them too. I’m not all that familiar with Balikwisha’s
  oeuvre, but he looks a lot of fun. If Celtic can get him one v one with
  Meghoma, or with Tierney overlapping, they’re in business. The Main Stand at
  Ibrox stadium: of the most beautiful structures in football. On the one hand,
  Miovski scored 32 in 77 for Aberdeen; on the other, he then mustered two in 18
  for Girona. Rangers desperately need him to succeed. I said earlier that
  Rodgers is under pressure and he is, but so too are the Celtic board, who need
  to deliver him players – they lack numbers and, following Kyogo’s departure,
  quality too. The Europa League group stages are sapping, especially when you
  don’t really want to be in them, and the need to progress in the competition
  adds pressure to that. So, back to the teams, where is the game? Rangers will,
  of course, look to control possession and build through midfield … but so will
  Celtic, who have the better players and more settled team. I wonder if,
  though, Martin will be a little more circumspect than usual, using Diomande
  and Barron in front of the back to block up the central areas and funnel
  attacks wide. I’d not be surprised if Celtic, meanwhile, target the space in
  behind Tavernier with Hatate and Nygren, withMcGregor and Engels crashing the
  box. Rodgers thinks this is a good game to have following the midweek
  disappointment, and hopes his team impose their style on it. Though Rangers
  have lots of technical players in their squad, they’re still looking for
  rhythm, and Celtic will have to be careful. The idea is to start well and
  defend when necessary, but mainly to put pressure on the opposition. He wants
  Celtic to show their confidence, hunger and fight, while Balikwisha should
  bring freshness, which the squad needs, and he’s good in one v ones as well as
  knowing the game well for a youngster. Otherwise, Adam Idah isn’t involved as
  he’s close to joining Swansea. I’m really looking forward to seeing how Mikey
  Moore gets on today – he’s got a lot of talent and has, I’m sure been sent by
  Spurs to play, toughen up and come back. Rangers will hope he can provide an
  outlet on the counter but also moments of magic in settled play, with
  Tavernier, Aasgaard and Gassama tasked with supplying Miovski. We’ll come back
  to that in a second, thoug, because Rodgers is speaking to Sky. I’m going to
  write the teams down, then we’ll wonder how they might perform. Celtic,
  meanwhile, bring in new signing Michel-Ange Balikwisha – Marcelo Saracchi is
  on the bench – and Arne Engels, with Yang Hyun-Jun and James Forrest dropping
  to the bench. What does it all mean? Nico Raskin, one of Rangers’ best players
  last season, isn’t even in the squad – there’s talk that he and Martin are
  less than cordial. Otherwise, there are five changes to the side edged 6-0 by
  Brugge: out go Max Aarons, sent off on Wednesday night, the injured Lyall
  Cameron, Danilo, Joe Rothwell and Oliver Antman; James Tavernier, Mohamed
  Diomande and Connor Barron comes in, likewise Mikey Moore, making his first
  start for the club, and Bojan Miovski, making his debut. Rangers: (4-3-3):
  Butland; Tavernier, Djiga, Souttar, Meghoma; Barron, Diomande, Aasgaar;
  Gassama, Movski, Moore Subs: Kelly, Aarons, Rothwell, Dessers, Bajrami,
  Antman, Fernandez, Curtis, Danilo. Celtic (4-3-3): Schmeichel; Ralston,
  Scales, Carter-Vickers, Tierney; McGregor, Hatate, Engels; Nygren, Maeda,
  Balikwisha. Subs: Sinisalo, Yang, McCowan, Shin, Bernardo, Saracchi, Murray,
  Forrest, Donovan. Referee: Marco Di Bello (Italy) Bournemouth v Arsenal; Betis
  v Villarreal; Como v Cremonese; Köln v Eintracht Frankfurt; Marseille v Lille:
  all a selection of seventh v second contests, which is what we have awaiting
  us this lunchtime. Of course, the Old Firm game is different – a celebration
  of vicious hatred like no other, regardless of league position. But after a
  disastrous start to the season, the question today is whether Rangers fans
  feel greater antipathy towards Celtic … or their own players and manager.
  Things could scarcely have gone worse for Russell Martin since arriving at
  Ibrox this summer, the dazzling purity of his futuristic game-model once again
  sophisticated beyond the intelligibility of everyone but him. So far this
  season, The Bears have achieved humiliation in Europe along with draws against
  Motherwell, Dundee and St Mirren, the sense that his tenure is already coming
  to an end: defeat today could mean curtains for the curtains. Nothing, though,
  could refresh them like a win over Celtic – who also arrive at this game
  having covered themselves in embarrassment, hoofed out of the Champions League
  qualifiers by the third-best team in Kazakhstan. That will have stung Brendan
  Rodgers – perhaps the only manager in football in greater thrall to himself
  than Martin – and Europe’s premier club competition, simply not the same
  without him in it. Most likely, he redeems himself by winning yet another
  title – in the league, his team have won three from three and have yet to
  concede a goal. But there is pressure to show he can deliver more than that, a
  decent run in the Europa League feeling imperative even if, in the meantime,
  there are cheap laughs to be won kicking rivals when they’re down. And if
  Celtic were to lose, to this Rangers, serious questions would be asked of his
  leadership too – or, in other words, this is going to be a lot of fun … for
  the rest of us. Kick-off: 12pm BST

The evidence is clear. 33 min I think he was, you know – he went just a little early, leaning ahead of the line, and though it was a good header I don’t think this is going to count. 33 min But was Souttar offside? This time, the delivery is spot-on, curling in, and Souttar races in to head past Schmeichel, who races out to get nowhere near the ball. 32 min Ralston concedes a free-kick for a cramp football-style foul – that’s a harsh call – on Aasgaard, and Tavernier has a third chance to flight a telling ball into the box… 30 min “Evie and Ryan were in Luxembourg and Vienna,” returns Simon McMahon, “they’re proper diehards. Derby day is like no other, and thankfully we don’t have the baggage that the Glasgow teams do, will be having a pint with my Dundee-supporting friends after the game, win, lose or draw. But as a United fan, as I think Cloughie once said, I don’t care how you do it, just win.” One thing, by the way, the Dundee sides share: blinding mid-80s kits. 29 min But this is slightly better, Aasgaard sliding in behind for Tavernier, whose cut-back is kicked behind by Scales. The resultant corner comes to nowt. 27 min Even for an Old Firm game, this is chaotic and basic. Neither side has yet to demonstrate anything beyond chasing, but Tvernier has another chance to put a ball into the box from a free-kick … and picks out Carter-Vickers. 25 min One of the things I enjoy about Ibrox is that everyone is stood up, all around the ground. Old Trafford was like that in the 70s, and 80s, with terraces on all four sides, and Elland Road still does a pretty good job on good days. The football, such as it is, remains of an agricultural nature. 23 min A bit of Celtic possession, as aimless as all that’s preceded it. But Nygren then wriggles a bit of room, Ralston crosses … and picks out Butland. 21 min He looks for the far side of the box and a knock across, but the flag goes up and Celtic clear. 20 min Moore moves through midfield but, with no one ahead of him, he has to turn back to Diomande. So Rangers build again, Tavernier into Aasgaard, central and 40 yards out; he wins a free-kick and the Rangers captain will stick a ball into the box. 19 min Gassama moves down the right, but Tierney stands him up and sees him away. 17 min Engels flips out to Balikwisha, whose cross is headed clear. That was a chance to attack Meghoma, but he took the conservative option. 17 min I’ve seen more quality in a box of Roses. 16 min Celtic slow it down, looking to bait the press and build with three at the back, but Rangers allow them to halfway before engaging, forcing them back to the keeper. 14 min Moore burrows down the left but can’t find space; he’ll never have experienced anything like this, which is exactly why Spurs sent him here. I’m not sure he’ll get much done driving into traffic: Rangers need to build elsewhere, then switch it to him when he’s in space. 12 min Gassama looks to attack the heart of the Celtic defence; McGregor unloads him quicksmart. It feels like the teams are being controlled by kids on a Sunny D buzz, having had no sleep for a week. 11 min Again, the ball goes into the heart of the box, and this time Scales heads behind. When the corner comes in, he flicks away, and the ball ends up with Butland. 10 min …and a nervous Hatate heads behind. Rangers are building a little bit of pressure, but Maeda heads Barron’s corner clear, then when he goes again, Scales concedes a throw. So Tavernier crosses to the left and will go again. 9 min There is, as yet, no pattern to this game; it’s more of a scribble. But Rangers win a throw deep inside the Celtic half and Tavernier will hurl long… 7 min Diomande sweeps a decent ball wide and Aasgaard sticks Miovski in behind, down the right. He looks to have got in behind Scales, goal-side and just inside the box; he goes does at the first hint of contact, demanding a penalty, but there’s nothing doing. 5 min Ralston shoves Diomande, who walks off with the ball after conceding a throw, then Rangers try knocking it about at the back; they’re quickly pressed into going long. 4 min It’s frenetic early doors, Rangers looking to get about McGregor and there are wild cheers as Aasgaard gets into Tierney deep inside the Celtic half, but they immediately regain possession then clear via throw. 2 min “Looking forward to this", writes Simon McMahon, but of course the real game of the day in Scotland takes place immediately after this one, as Dundee United and Jim Goodwin’s Tangerine Army walk up the road to face Dundee at Dens. I’m sending this now as I’m currently at hospitality in Tannadice with Evie and Ryan before making the short walk with 3,500 fellow Arabs. United have been ravaged by injury during the early part of the season and remain without Ryan Strain, Kristian Trapanovski, Ross Graham, Isaac Pappoe, Zac Sapsford and Max Watters, but new signing Nikolaj Moller is available. Having lost the last two derbies, unluckily in the Scottish Cup at Dens back in January, and not unluckily in the league at Tannadice in March, United will be desperate to win. But so will Dundee, who have not won consecutive league derbies in over 20 years. So it’s all to play for. May the best team United win. By a shedload.” My mate went to Luxembourg the other week, and the papers took an interest… 1 min And away we go! Ibrox is jumping, Simply the Best pumping over the PA. i’m hoping Chris Eubank will now vault the rope. Our teams are tunnelled … and here they come! Martin says today will tell him plenty about where the team are a s a group. He wants them to be brave on the ball. He’s also really happy to have Miovski in, likewise the freshness and excitement of Moore. On Raskin, he says no decision he makes is about him or a particular player but whatever’s best for the team in that moment. He wants his players to better than every department than they were in midweek, and he’s excited to see how it goes. I know Celtic have kept five clean sheets already this season, but I’m not totally convinced by their centre-backs. Miovski has the pace and agility to trouble Scales and Carter-Vickers, while Moore has the pace, skill and short backlift to zip in off the flank and worry them too. I’m not all that familiar with Balikwisha’s oeuvre, but he looks a lot of fun. If Celtic can get him one v one with Meghoma, or with Tierney overlapping, they’re in business. The Main Stand at Ibrox stadium: of the most beautiful structures in football. On the one hand, Miovski scored 32 in 77 for Aberdeen; on the other, he then mustered two in 18 for Girona. Rangers desperately need him to succeed. I said earlier that Rodgers is under pressure and he is, but so too are the Celtic board, who need to deliver him players – they lack numbers and, following Kyogo’s departure, quality too. The Europa League group stages are sapping, especially when you don’t really want to be in them, and the need to progress in the competition adds pressure to that. So, back to the teams, where is the game? Rangers will, of course, look to control possession and build through midfield … but so will Celtic, who have the better players and more settled team. I wonder if, though, Martin will be a little more circumspect than usual, using Diomande and Barron in front of the back to block up the central areas and funnel attacks wide. I’d not be surprised if Celtic, meanwhile, target the space in behind Tavernier with Hatate and Nygren, withMcGregor and Engels crashing the box. Rodgers thinks this is a good game to have following the midweek disappointment, and hopes his team impose their style on it. Though Rangers have lots of technical players in their squad, they’re still looking for rhythm, and Celtic will have to be careful. The idea is to start well and defend when necessary, but mainly to put pressure on the opposition. He wants Celtic to show their confidence, hunger and fight, while Balikwisha should bring freshness, which the squad needs, and he’s good in one v ones as well as knowing the game well for a youngster. Otherwise, Adam Idah isn’t involved as he’s close to joining Swansea. I’m really looking forward to seeing how Mikey Moore gets on today – he’s got a lot of talent and has, I’m sure been sent by Spurs to play, toughen up and come back. Rangers will hope he can provide an outlet on the counter but also moments of magic in settled play, with Tavernier, Aasgaard and Gassama tasked with supplying Miovski. We’ll come back to that in a second, thoug, because Rodgers is speaking to Sky. I’m going to write the teams down, then we’ll wonder how they might perform. Celtic, meanwhile, bring in new signing Michel-Ange Balikwisha – Marcelo Saracchi is on the bench – and Arne Engels, with Yang Hyun-Jun and James Forrest dropping to the bench. What does it all mean? Nico Raskin, one of Rangers’ best players last season, isn’t even in the squad – there’s talk that he and Martin are less than cordial. Otherwise, there are five changes to the side edged 6-0 by Brugge: out go Max Aarons, sent off on Wednesday night, the injured Lyall Cameron, Danilo, Joe Rothwell and Oliver Antman; James Tavernier, Mohamed Diomande and Connor Barron comes in, likewise Mikey Moore, making his first start for the club, and Bojan Miovski, making his debut. Rangers: (4-3-3): Butland; Tavernier, Djiga, Souttar, Meghoma; Barron, Diomande, Aasgaar; Gassama, Movski, Moore Subs: Kelly, Aarons, Rothwell, Dessers, Bajrami, Antman, Fernandez, Curtis, Danilo. Celtic (4-3-3): Schmeichel; Ralston, Scales, Carter-Vickers, Tierney; McGregor, Hatate, Engels; Nygren, Maeda, Balikwisha. Subs: Sinisalo, Yang, McCowan, Shin, Bernardo, Saracchi, Murray, Forrest, Donovan. Referee: Marco Di Bello (Italy) Bournemouth v Arsenal; Betis v Villarreal; Como v Cremonese; Köln v Eintracht Frankfurt; Marseille v Lille: all a selection of seventh v second contests, which is what we have awaiting us this lunchtime. Of course, the Old Firm game is different – a celebration of vicious hatred like no other, regardless of league position. But after a disastrous start to the season, the question today is whether Rangers fans feel greater antipathy towards Celtic … or their own players and manager. Things could scarcely have gone worse for Russell Martin since arriving at Ibrox this summer, the dazzling purity of his futuristic game-model once again sophisticated beyond the intelligibility of everyone but him. So far this season, The Bears have achieved humiliation in Europe along with draws against Motherwell, Dundee and St Mirren, the sense that his tenure is already coming to an end: defeat today could mean curtains for the curtains. Nothing, though, could refresh them like a win over Celtic – who also arrive at this game having covered themselves in embarrassment, hoofed out of the Champions League qualifiers by the third-best team in Kazakhstan. That will have stung Brendan Rodgers – perhaps the only manager in football in greater thrall to himself than Martin – and Europe’s premier club competition, simply not the same without him in it. Most likely, he redeems himself by winning yet another title – in the league, his team have won three from three and have yet to concede a goal. But there is pressure to show he can deliver more than that, a decent run in the Europa League feeling imperative even if, in the meantime, there are cheap laughs to be won kicking rivals when they’re down. And if Celtic were to lose, to this Rangers, serious questions would be asked of his leadership too – or, in other words, this is going to be a lot of fun … for the rest of us. Kick-off: 12pm BST
