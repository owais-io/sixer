  Heathrow has submitted its “shovel-ready” plans for a third runway as part of
  a £50bn investment, as the government said expanding Europe’s largest airport
  could create 100,000 jobs and drive growth. The 2-mile (3.2km) runway
  expansion would cross a diverted M25 and allow more than 750 additional
  flights a day over London, helping bring the total annual number of passengers
  to 150 million. Environmental campaigners called it a “doomed scheme” that
  would release millions of tonnes of CO2 while benefiting only a small minority
  of rich flyers. Heathrow said that with government support it could obtain
  planning permission by 2029 and have the runway in operation by 2035. Its
  proposals remain essentially the same as those submitted in 2019 and approved
  in principle by the government and MPs. That scheme survived a brief block on
  climate grounds sparked by legal challenges from campaigners, overturned on
  appeal in 2020. However, the plans were put on hold as passenger numbers
  dropped during the pandemic. The shareholders in the airport, which include
  the French private equity firm Ardian and Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s sovereign
  wealth funds, are seeking legislative change, as well as long-term political
  support, before filing a full planning application. Rachel Reeves, the
  chancellor, has strongly endorsed expansion, but Heathrow is seeking firm
  policy guarantees after previous runway plans were overturned. These include
  airspace modernisation to ensure extra flight paths and the passing of the
  planning and infrastructure bill. The airport is also seeking guarantees that
  the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), would allow
  Heathrow to levy charges to airlines at a level high enough to recoup its
  investment. Heathrow said the price of the runway itself would now be £21bn,
  up from £14bn six years ago, due to inflation in construction costs. An
  additional extension of Terminal 5 to support the extra passengers would cost
  £12bn, while another £15bn spend is planned to upgrade the wider airport
  regardless of the runway development. The chief executive of the airport,
  Thomas Woldbye, said it had “never been more important or urgent to expand
  Heathrow”. He said: “We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment
  of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct
  policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose regulatory model, we are ready
  to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the
  country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country. It is time to
  clear the way for takeoff.” A government spokesperson said: “Expanding
  Heathrow could drive growth, trade and tourism, whilst unlocking over 100,000
  jobs.” The government has promised to review the plans over the summer, with
  Heathrow pressing for a green light in September. It will also examine a rival
  proposal from a developer, the Arora Group, which has drawn up plans for a
  shorter runway further to the east. A Heathrow spokesperson said the airport
  was open to discussing with airlines the potential for a shorter runway, but
  it did not believe alternative schemes could reduce the cost or deliver the
  same benefits as the existing plans. The hub’s expansion is backed by business
  groups and unions, as well as the government, despite arguments that unchecked
  aviation growth is incompatible with Britain’s net zero ambitions and tackling
  the climate emergency. The CBI, British Chambers of Commerce, MakeUK and the
  Federation of Small Businesses said in a joint statement that the third runway
  “opens up vital access to major and emerging markets [and] unlocks billions in
  private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving
  skills across the country”. Heathrow claims expansion would also create more
  competition. British Airways currently operates half of all flights from
  Heathrow and airlines jealously guard rights to valuable slots. EasyJet said
  the runway represented “a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the
  airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for
  consumers”. However, opponents questioned whether the scheme would progress,
  having failed to move ahead so far despite approval from two previous
  governments. Paul McGuinness, the chair of the No 3rd Runway coalition, said:
  “There’s a real danger that we’ll end up with a hole in the ground and a debt
  pile for taxpayers to underwrite, because the government had foolishly
  encouraged Heathrow’s profligate self-interest, as if blind to the lessons of
  HS2.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said a new runway would have “a hugely
  detrimental impact on our environment”. Dr Douglas Parr, the policy director
  for Greenpeace UK, said the announcements meant residents around Heathrow
  would have “their lives put on hold for a few more years while more money and
  time is wasted on a doomed scheme … the economic case for the whole debacle
  just will not fly”.
