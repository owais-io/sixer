  They say good things come to those who wait. But for Eberechi Eze, it has
  taken 14 years for his dream to come true. The England forward made a dramatic
  entrance during Crystal Palace’s open training session on Wednesday before
  their Conference League playoff when he was last to emerge from the changing
  room with frenzied anticipation that his expected move to Tottenham was close
  to being agreed. Even if he had been aware of Arsenal’s intention to step up
  their longstanding interest in him, Eze was certainly giving nothing away when
  he signed autographs and spoke to supporters on his way out of Palace’s
  training ground in Beckenham. It was later on Wednesday afternoon that the
  Palace chair, Steve Parish, received a call from Arsenal’s executive
  vice-chair, Tim Lewis, indicating they were finally ready to act. The full
  severity of the knee injury suffered by Kai Havertz during his substitute
  appearance against Manchester United on Sunday is unknown, although the German
  forward is expected to be sidelined for the immediate future. With Arsenal
  facing four of last season’s top seven in successive Premier League matches
  after they entertain Leeds on Saturday, Mikel Arteta felt he was short of
  numbers in attack. It is understood Parish had reluctantly agreed a fee with
  Spurs that in effect matched Eze’s expired release clause of £67.5m, albeit
  with them paying less than the £60m they had asked for up front and with more
  bonuses included. Arsenal were well aware Palace wanted immediate funds for a
  replacement and were ready with an offer that satisfied both sides. Their
  trump card, however, was Eze. He has made no secret of his continued
  affiliations to the club that released him from their academy at the age of
  13, even if the scars of rejection took a long time to heal. “It’s one of the
  hardest battles I’ve had,” he told the BBC before the FA Cup final in May.
  “Because of what Arsenal meant to me at the time, I had tears rolling down my
  face.” He was also rejected by Fulham, Reading and Millwall before finally
  convincing Queens Park Rangers to give him a chance in 2016 as he was
  preparing to enrol in a local college and start working part-time at Tesco.
  Their faith was rewarded by Eze’s breakthrough into the first team under the
  watchful eye of Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand, the former Tottenham striker
  who was QPR’s director of football when Palace paid £19.5m to sign him in
  August 2020 and inserted a 15% sell-on clause on any profit. That will ensure
  QPR receive around £6m from the move to Arsenal. “Sometimes, as a player, you
  can think ‘has my chance gone?’ But he’s shown great strength of character and
  his ability has shone through,” said Ferdinand when Eze was called up by
  England for Euro 2024. “A lot of the best players have been rejected somewhere
  and it just pushes you on to achieve more.” It took Eze three months to score
  his first goal for Palace, a brilliant free-kick against Leeds at an empty
  Selhurst Park – because of Covid restrictions – in November 2020, before he
  missed most of the next season with an achilles injury that also scuppered his
  hopes of a first England call-up. But he has flourished since returning,
  scoring 29 times in the Premier League over the past three seasons and
  underlining his status as a Palace legend with the winning goal against
  Manchester City at Wembley when the club lifted their first major trophy. It
  seems fitting Eze chose a replica of the shirt Ian Wright and co wore in the
  1990 FA Cup final for the parade a few days later, which had been donated by a
  fan. Wright, who joined Arsenal from Palace in September 1991 for £2.5m, was
  27 at the time and proved he was more than capable of making the step up. Eze,
  born and raised in Greenwich – just up the road from Arsenal’s original home
  in Woolwich – will follow Kenny Sansom, Paul Davis and David Rocastle as south
  Londoners who crossed the river. Eze will always have a special place in the
  hearts of Palace fans who will not begrudge him this deserved opportunity. As
  those who have followed the club for generations will testify after waving
  goodbye to Wright, Andy Johnson and Michael Olise over the years, it is best
  not to get too attached to your heroes.
