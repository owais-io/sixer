  New seasons are never new starts, not entirely. The sun may have been shining
  and the temperature in the mid‑20s. There may have been new kits on the pitch
  and new flags in the stands. There may have been an obsessive focus on the new
  signings. There may, among home fans, perhaps especially those refreshed in
  the new marquee behind the Stretford End, have been a giddy expectation that
  this season couldn’t be as bad as last for Manchester United. But the roots of
  a game run deep, stretching back into the mulch of the past. This was a game
  shaped by events last December. Arsenal are good at set pieces; United are
  vulnerable to inswinging deliveries. In December last year Arsenal beat United
  2-0 at the Emirates Stadium, both goals the result of corners. United had
  André Onana in goal for that one, but Tottenham had taken notice of the
  susceptibility to balls arced into the goalmouth, the way United struggled to
  protect their keeper. Two weeks later, Spurs played United in the Carabao Cup.
  Altay Bayindir was in goal for that one and endured the indignity of being
  beaten direct from a corner by Son Heung-min. United don’t like inswingers and
  Bayindir really doesn’t like inswingers. Declan Rice is good at taking
  inswingers. And so there was a certain inevitability to what happened after 13
  minutes. United had looked vaguely threatening. Arsenal had been rattled
  enough to commit four fouls in that period. Then Arsenal won a corner from
  their left. Rice whipped it in, Bayindir flapped and would have scored an
  own-goal had Riccardo Calafiori not nodded the ball over the line from the
  goal-line. United, perhaps, could point to the way William Saliba, having
  grappled with Mason Mount, bumped into him just as the ball arrived, and
  perhaps, given the new directives to referees to crack down on holding, a foul
  could have been given. But then there were half a dozen incidents that could
  have been penalised one way or the other in the box from that one corner; any
  refereeing decision in such circumstances could not but feel arbitrary.
  Fundamentally, with more decisive goalkeeping there wouldn’t have been an
  issue. David Raya’s assertive punch to clear an inswinging free-kick from
  Bruno Fernandes early in the second half, cuffing Matthijs de Ligt out of the
  way, showed the way to do it. Maybe the analogy was never entirely apt. Maybe
  building from the foundations up doesn’t necessarily mean getting the defence
  right. Maybe as football increasingly becomes about content production there
  is some sort of commercial logic in prioritising the goalscorers and the
  creators, the players who will look good clipped up or, to continue the
  metaphor, the spire, the ornamentation on the roof. But on the other hand, it
  doesn’t much matter if you’ve spent £200m on forwards if you’re going to
  concede goals like that. Particularly if you don’t then actually score
  yourself. There were positive signs from both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha
  but the most incisive United player, yet again, was Amad Diallo, who came off
  the bench to play at right wing-back 10 minutes into the second half. United,
  perhaps, would consider themselves unfortunate. Patrick Dorgu hit the post and
  Raya had to make seven saves, more than any other goalkeeper on the opening
  weekend. But only his reflex stop down to his left to keep out a Cunha effort
  from a narrow angle was a save that he would not necessarily be expected to
  make. To point out that United drew this fixture last season and that they’re
  therefore doing worse this season is on one level meaningless. But equally
  this is a manager whose win percentage is 37.2%, the worst in half a century –
  and if United fail to win at Fulham next week, he will drop below both Frank
  O’Farrell and Wilf McGuinness to have the worst win percentage of any United
  manager since Herbert Bamlett, who was sacked in 1931. Context matters. There
  was plenty of mitigation on Sunday afternoon. The closer you zoom in the more
  excuses can be found: a goalkeeping error, new players settling in, a couple
  of close-run things. But it won’t take many more bad results for faith in
  Amorim to wane. When form has been so bad, it’s only natural to catastrophise:
  if they don’t win at Craven Cottage, the next home match, against
  newly-promoted Burnley, takes on a ghastly aspect: not merely a game they
  should win, but a game they have to win. This season is not discrete from the
  last. New signings, a resetting of the table, new hope, cannot erase the
  footfalls that echo in the memory. Poor results are a problem not only in
  themselves but for the impact they have on games to come: time present and
  time past are both perhaps present in time future.
