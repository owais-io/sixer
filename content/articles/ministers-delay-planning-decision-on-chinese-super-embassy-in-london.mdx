  Ministers have delayed a decision on whether to grant planning permission to a
  proposed Chinese “super-embassy” in London amid concerns about redacted
  drawings in the building’s plans. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner,
  was expected to make a decision on 9 September but has pushed the date back to
  21 October, saying more time was needed to consider the plans for the
  development, which would occupy 20,000 sq metres (five acres) at Royal Mint
  Court in east London. The plan has met fierce opposition from local people and
  campaigners concerned about Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong and the
  Xinjiang region. Several large protests have taken place outside the site in
  recent months. Earlier this month, Rayner, who also serves as the housing
  secretary, gave the Chinese embassy two weeks to send additional details about
  its plans. In a letter, she noted that two of the proposed embassy buildings
  in the drawings – the cultural exchange building and Embassy House – had been
  “greyed out”. She wrote to the planning consultancy in charge of the Chinese
  embassy proposal, asking it to “identify precisely and comprehensively” the
  drawings that had been redacted and explain the rationale and justification
  for the redactions. The consultancy responded earlier this week, saying it was
  “neither necessary nor appropriate” to provide full internal layout plans. In
  correspondence published by Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the
  Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, one of several parties that has
  objected to the embassy’s construction, the consultancy said: “The applicant
  considers the level of detail shown on the unredacted plans is sufficient to
  identify the main uses.” De Pulford said: “These explanations are far from
  satisfactory. The government set very few conditions and the Chinese didn’t
  even meet those. Now, to visit the abbey ruins, dissidents who want to visit
  will be on Chinese land, vulnerable to capture, out of the reach of UK
  authorities.” The Chinese embassy in the UK called on the government to
  “fulfil its obligation and approve the planning application without delay”. It
  said in a statement: “The planning and design of the new Chinese embassy
  project is of high quality, which has been well recognised by various
  professional bodies. The planning application has followed the customary
  diplomatic practices, as well as necessary protocol and procedures. In our
  reply to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, we have
  provided a comprehensive response to the questions concerning the planning
  application. “It is an international obligation of the host country to provide
  support and facilitation for the construction of diplomatic premises. Both
  China and the UK plan to build new embassies in each other’s capitals. The
  Chinese side urges the UK side to fulfil its obligation and approve the
  planning application without delay.” China bought the Royal Mint Court site
  for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there stalled after Tower
  Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022, citing security concerns
  and opposition from residents. The Conservative government declined to
  intervene but Labour took the matter out of the council’s hands by calling it
  in soon after taking power last summer. The future of the embassy has become a
  major issue in diplomatic relations between the UK and China. The country’s
  president, Xi Jinping, raised it with Keir Starmer in their first phone call
  last August. The Guardian reported last year that China was blocking requests
  to rebuild the British embassy in Beijing while the fate of its embassy in
  London was being decided.
