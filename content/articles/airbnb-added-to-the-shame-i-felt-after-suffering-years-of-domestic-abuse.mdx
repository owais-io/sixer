  I spent years in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic and notorious sex
  pest. In 2018, I broke free when he moved abroad to escape his creditors. A
  year later, I tried to make my first Airbnb booking, only to have it cancelled
  because my account was permanently blocked. Airbnb declined to tell me why.
  Later, I discovered that my ex had used my phone number and his own email
  address to set up one account in his name, and an old email address of mine to
  set up a second. I hadn’t received any notification of the use of my phone
  number, but I found, in my disused email account, several emails addressed to
  my ex. I feared he might have done something terrible at a rental property and
  got banned and, because he had used my details, got me banned, too. Airbnb
  eventually told me the ban was linked to fraud. In 2020, I tried to book
  again, but 24 hours later the booking was cancelled, and my account blocked.
  Five years on, I noticed all four deactivated accounts are still visible on
  the platform – the two created by me, and the two set up using my details by
  my ex – and I’m still blocked. Airbnb promised to look into it but never got
  back to me. Domestic violence brings a lot of shame, and having to explain it
  each time to Airbnb agents feels deeply personal and humiliating. But the real
  shame lies with Airbnb – allowing an abusive man to practically steal my
  identity, perpetuating abuse and potentially putting others at risk. Name and
  address withheld The platform boasts rigorous identity checks on new and
  existing account holders, including verification of contact details via
  “trusted third-party sources”. However, the process was only introduced in
  2023. It told me that your ex created the original account in 2013. It was
  never used, and it closed it the same year. It did not elaborate on the second
  account, which appears to have prompted the fraud block. It claims your email,
  detailing your circumstances, was “not received”. It says it is investigating
  why not, so “the appeal process can be reviewed for improvements”. Airbnb has
  now restored your account and given you a £200 voucher. It says: “To help
  build and keep trust in our community, we suspend accounts suspected to be
  fraudulent. We are sorry for the time it took to resolve this case.” We
  welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at
