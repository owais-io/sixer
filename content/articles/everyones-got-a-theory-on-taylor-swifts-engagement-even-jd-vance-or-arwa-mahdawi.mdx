  The secret meanings behind Taylor Swift’s engagement Breaking news alerts were
  pinged to phones around the world; Swifties screamed in the street; the Prince
  and Princess of Wales delivered their royal approval; Donald Trump wished them
  luck. By now it will not have escaped your attention that Taylor Swift, the
  reigning queen of pop, is engaged to Travis Kelce, a podcaster who also plays
  football. What does this engagement mean? It’s possible you naively think it
  simply means an extremely famous woman and a somewhat famous man enjoy each
  other’s company and want to settle down together to start a big, beautiful
  brand partnership. Wrong! When it comes to Swift, Occam’s razor rarely
  applies. The megastar is known for hiding Easter eggs and hidden meaning in
  her musical output; she has driven a lot of otherwise normal people on
  quixotic missions into the deep, dark depths of her lyrics to validate their
  left-field theories about their idol. Who can forget, for example, the
  5,000-word essay published in the New York Times last year arguing that Swift
  is secretly part of the LGBTQ+ community and communicating that fact via coded
  lyrics? A surprisingly large number of “Gaylors” seem invested in this theory:
  a Gaylor subreddit has more than 50,000 members. Following news of the
  proposal, it went private to avoid trolling from outsiders. While the
  engagement has sent some Gaylors into mourning, various conservatives are
  celebrating the idea that Swift might be on her way from being an independent
  career woman to a tradwife. On his podcast, the rightwing activist Charlie
  Kirk mused that getting married and having kids changes a person, and he hopes
  that it will “deradicalize” the billionaire – who is, it must be said, not
  widely known for having any radical ideas. “Taylor Swift might go from a cat
  lady to a JD Vance supporter,” Kirk said. “I think that if she ends up having
  children, she’ll stop this kind of liberal endorsing Joe Biden nonsense.”
  (Well, I mean, she’s not going to be endorsing Biden any more, that’s for
  sure.) Kirk added: “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re
  not in charge.” Oh, I think she is. While Vance himself hasn’t weighed in on
  whether he thinks the Kelce effect will mean Swift suddenly has a Mar-a-Lago
  makeover and starts fangirling over Maga politics, he has aired his thoughts
  on the news. More specifically, he used the Swift-Kelce engagement to float
  the conspiracy theory that NFL games could be rigged for Kelce’s team, the
  Chiefs. “I hope that the NFL does not put a thumb on the scale for the Kansas
  City Chiefs just because Travis Kelce is now getting married to maybe the most
  famous woman in the world,” Vance told USA Today in an interview on Wednesday.
  It’s not just the right projecting their hopes, dreams and weird Super Bowl
  fantasies on to Kelce-Swift. Some Swifties have been gushing over what a great
  guy Kelce is because “he has no issue with Swift being successful”. While
  Kelce may well be supportive of his megastar fiancee, let’s not get carried
  away and frame him as some sort of feminist. The football star has called
  women “breeders” in the past and defended his Kansas City Chiefs teammate
  Harrison Butker after Butker delivered a bigoted commencement speech last
  year, calling Pride month a “deadly sin” and telling women they should be more
  excited about getting married and having kids than having a successful career.
  Kelce made clear that he doesn’t agree with the majority of Butker’s views,
  but said it wasn’t his place to criticize them. Kind of a slap in the face to
  all of Swift’s queer fans for her husband-to-be to let the Pride comments
  slide, just because Butker has always been nice to him. Various other hot
  takes about the engagement abound. The business press have been talking about
  how the engagement might boost stocks and marketing trade journals have been
  looking at brand reactions. No doubt even defence industry publications (which
  have previously put out bangers like What Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Can
  Teach Veterans About Federal Resumes) will find an angle. If you can’t beat
  them, join them: since it’s the Swift Hot Take Super Bowl, I’ll quickly get
  mine in. I think the singer is very talented, and I’m glad she makes a lot of
  people very happy, but I do wish she would do a Ms Rachel and use her
  unmatched influence to shame politicians into action on Gaza. Or at least
  follow the lead of the YouTuber Lindsay Ellis and raise money for suffering
  kids. Parents are having to watch their children wither away amid a man-made
  famine facilitated (and denied) by the US. Doctors are coming back from Gaza
  with harrowing stories about Israeli soldiers targeting kids with shots to the
  head and deliberately shooting teenage boys in the testicles. You can argue
  all day about whether celebrities have an obligation to speak out about
  injustice or not but, ultimately, having so much influence and choosing not to
  use it in the face of a genocide your government is helping to perpetuate, and
  your engagement knocks from the front page, is not “neutrality”. It is a
  deliberate choice. Amnesty calls for end of investigation into Polish doctor
  who performed abortion Last year, Dr Gizela Jagielska was targeted by
  anti-abortion extremists after she provided a legal late-term abortion to a
  woman in a hospital in southern Poland after her unborn baby was diagnosed
  with a fatal foetal anomaly. Poland has some of the most restrictive abortion
  laws in Europe. Jagielska is being investigated by authorities and faces
  possible imprisonment of up to eight years. “Instead of investigating Dr
  Jagielska’s conduct, the Polish authorities must look into the attacks she has
  faced since the investigation was announced,” Amnesty International said in a
  statement this week. Now I ain’t saying she’s a gold digger … but she is
  trademarking the term What first attracted the 24-year-old former cheerleader
  Jordon Hudson to the 73-year-old multimillionaire Bill Belichick, I wonder? We
  may never know. But do we know that Hudson’s company has filed a trademark
  application for the term “gold digger”, to be used on jewellery or keychains.
  Instead of getting huffy about the jokes about her being attracted to
  Belichick’s big bank account, she’s monetizing them. Italian police
  investigating porn site with doctored pictures of prominent women If you are a
  woman in the public eye, it’s almost inevitable that insecure men will use
  technology to humiliate you online. And the tech bros who keep telling us AI
  will revolutionize the world seem helpless (or just not interested) when it
  comes to stopping it. Snoop Dogg is ‘scared to go to the movies’ because of
  animated lesbians The musician has called himself a “gangsta” but he’s
  apparently terrified of two fictional women parenting a child together. Snoop
  told a podcast he was horrified when he took his grandson to see Pixar’s
  Lightyear and the child asked about the two gay mums in the movie. Instead of
  just answering his grandson’s question like a normal person, Snoop clutched
  his pearls. Denmark apologises for forced contraception of Greenlandic women
  It’s estimated that 4,500 women and girls were fitted with contraceptive coils
  without their permission or knowledge in the 1960s in an attempt to reduce the
  population of Greenland. UK gender pay gap underestimated for two decades,
  report says The faulty methodology, which gave undue weight to large
  companies, resulted in an underestimate of a “small but noteworthy” margin of
  one percentage point, new research says. Fertility rate hits record low in
  England, Scotland and Wales And we will continue to see headlines like this
  until the cost of living goes down (or wages rise in response) and having
  children becomes more affordable. Grammy-award winning singer Tems is helping
  African women navigate music industry The Nigerian singer-songwriter and
  producer, born Temilade Openiyi, has launched the Leading Vibe Initiative to
  try to help more young women in Africa overcome the hurdles of breaking into
  the music industry. How an oil spill in Mauritius led to a female revolution
  in farming After a wrecked ship polluted the water and sank the local economy,
  a group of women formed the South-East Ladies Agro collective and started
  “bringing home the bok choi”. The week in pawtriarchy In the Guardian, Frances
  Ryan considers the impaw-tant question: is it wrong to throw a birthday party
  for my dog? The short answer is: absolutely not, your pooch would be barking
  mad if you didn’t. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist
