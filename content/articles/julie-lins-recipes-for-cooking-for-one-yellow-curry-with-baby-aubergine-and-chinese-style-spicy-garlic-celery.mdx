  Celery divides people, perhaps because most of us are introduced to it in the
  form of batons dipped into hummus, which I don’t feel is its best form. Don’t
  get me wrong, I enjoy raw celery – it has an earthy pepperiness that I find
  quite moreish – but I adore it in cooked form, especially with soy and garlic,
  and today’s recipe is a take on a wok-fried celery dish that we often eat at
  large banquets in Malaysia. But first, a silky, fragrant curry with tender
  baby aubergines and a golden coconut base that’s perfect with hot steamed rice
  and a scattering of fresh herbs. These baby purple aubergines are perfect for
  one person, and hold their structure well in a curry. I adore them. Yellow
  curry with baby aubergine (pictured top) This is more for a day when I’m
  pottering around – the paste seems a bit laborious, but I don’t believe that
  cooking for yourself always needs to be quick; love and care and time can also
  be put into the process, especially when you get this golden, rich and
  nourishing curry at the end. Prep 20 min Cook 40 min Serves 1 200ml coconut
  milk 1 tbsp coconut oil 3 baby aubergines, cut into 4cm chunks 4–5 curry
  leaves ¼ tsp ground turmeric ½ tbsp fish sauce Juice of ¼ lime, or to taste ½
  tsp palm sugar, or brown sugar 1 pinch of salt ¼ tsp MSG (optional, but
  lovely) For the paste 1 small shallot, peeled and chopped 1 small thumb of
  ginger, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 tsp) 1 small thumb of galangal,
  chopped (about 1 tsp) ½ stalk lemongrass, tender part only, finely sliced 1
  garlic clove, peeled and chopped 1 dried red chilli, soaked in hot water for
  10 minutes, drained and chopped 1 small fresh red chilli, chopped ¼ tsp
  belacan (shrimp paste), dry toasted until crumbly To serve Steamed jasmine
  rice Dill sprigs Crispy garlic (optional) Put all the paste ingredients in a
  blender and blitz to a rough paste; if need be, add a splash of water to help
  it along. In a small pan, reduce the coconut milk on a low-medium heat until
  it thickens and starts to split slightly – this will help bring out its
  natural oils and sweetness. In a second pan, heat a little coconut oil, then
  fry the aubergines in batches until golden and soft. Transfer to a rack or
  plate lined with paper towel to drain any excess oil. In the same pan, fry the
  curry leaves in a touch of oil until they start to pop, then add the paste and
  cook gently on a medium heat, stirring continuously, for five to seven
  minutes, until fragrant and the oil begins to split – this is when the magic
  happens. Add the turmeric and fry for another 30 seconds. Stir in the reduced
  coconut milk, season with the fish sauce, lime juice, a little sugar, salt and
  MSG, if using, then taste and adjust until it hits that beautiful balance of
  salty, sweet, sour and creamy. Return the aubergines to the pan and simmer for
  a few minutes so they soak up all that rich flavour. Serve with steamed
  jasmine rice and topped with fresh dill and crispy garlic. Chinese-style spicy
  garlic celery Once you get the knack of the timings, you can switch up the
  flavourings to whatever you fancy; if you want a more floral version, say, add
  some fried ginger. Again, this is a dish bursting with flavour and something I
  make for myself when I need something green with a satisfying crunch. Prep 10
  min Cook 15 min Serves 1 2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine 3 tbsp light soy sauce 1
  tsp white sugar 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 bunch celery, sliced on an angle 5
  garlic cloves, peeled and finely diced 1 tsp cornflour, mixed with 3 tbsp
  water to make a paste Salt and white pepper 1 tsp Malaysian crispy prawn
  chilli, or crispy chilli oil In a small bowl, mix the rice wine, soy sauce and
  sugar. Put the vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat, then add the celery and
  stir-fry for a minute, until a little translucent. Add the garlic and stir-fry
  for two to three minutes, until fragrant, then add the rice wine, soy and
  sugar mixture, followed by the cornflour paste, and stir-fry until everything
  thickens slightly and all the flavours come together. Taste and adjust the
  seasoning with salt and ground white pepper. Finally, stir in the crispy prawn
  chilli or crispy chilli oil, make a few final tosses, then serve piping hot.
