  The voice of the writer Toni Cade Bambara overlays a montage of archival film
  and photographs of Black people at school and work in a new feature
  documentary about her life. “The Reconstruction era offers a window into the
  1930s,” Bambara says in the film. “There is the same drive for land, for the
  vote, for labor rights, education. The same need for self-help enterprises,
  for group cooperation.” So begins TCB – The Toni Cade Bambara School of
  Organizing, the biographical film about the Black author, documentarian and
  social activist whose work on Black liberation and feminism helped inspire
  20th-century social justice movements. The documentary by the film-maker Louis
  Massiah and Monica Henriquez is a composite of her words and stories from her
  friends including Toni Morrison. A screening of TCB – The Toni Cade Bambara
  School of Organizing will kick off the 14th annual BlackStar Film Festival,
  running from 31 July to 3 August in various locations around Philadelphia,
  Pennsylvania, and online. Ranging from shorts to features, the more than 90
  films in this year’s program are “leaning into the moment”, said the festival
  director, Nehad Khader, by highlighting films about legacy and the power of
  community building, as well as labor and economics. The festival, produced by
  the non-profit BlackStar Projects, showcases the work of film-makers of color,
  earning it the nickname, the “Black Sundance” by Ebony Magazine. Last year,
  more than 15,000 viewers attended the BlackStar film festival in person and
  online. Its emphasis on genre-defying films, said Khader, and solidarity among
  Black, brown and Indigenous people sets it apart from similar festivals.
  Festival staff strive to make it inclusive by offering childcare to the
  film-makers throughout the showings, providing American sign language
  interpreters for public events, and including audio descriptions in some of
  the screenings. Along with the films, the festival also features a session for
  eight independent film-makers to pitch their ideas to a judge of executives,
  funders and producers, with the chance to win $75,000 to go toward production
  costs, as well as mentorship from the production company Multitude Films. The
  team behind the StoryCorps program Brightness in Black, which highlights
  stories about Black life across the US, will also host a live event about
  using storytelling to inspire change. A licensed clinical social worker will
  guide festivalgoers to reflect on ancestral wisdom during wellness sessions
  throughout the four days, and yoga classes will be offered in the mornings.
  Panel discussions will highlight ways to preserve archives in the face of
  censorship, honor the legacy of Black film-makers and storytellers, and Black
  music as a tool for resistance. Mixers for film-makers and viewers will be
  held throughout the weekend, and the festival will begin and end with evening
  parties. In our current socio-political climate, the BlackStar Film Festival
  “is a place to build community more than anything else”, said Khader. “In
  community you can grieve and you can celebrate and that’s what human
  connection and society and evolution has been about for hundreds of thousands
  of years,” she said. Massiah, who was a friend and colleague of Bambara’s
  before her death in 1995, sees the BlackStar Film Festival attenders as the
  intended audience for his film. “Bambara was clear,” Massiah said over email.
  “She prophesizes in the film that a festival gathering like BlackStar is
  crucial for the kind of society that we’re trying to build.” Khader hopes that
  the message around the power of community in the opening film about Bambara
  will set the tone throughout the festival’s four days. “We want people to come
  away feeling like they’re cared for, their wellness was thought of,” Khader
  said, “like they had a moment in these difficult times to celebrate, and also
  to reflect on everything that’s happening.” ‘A homecoming for the film-makers’
  In summer 2012, the film festival began as a screening of 40 films from four
  continents over four days. Maori Karmael Holmes, the founder, chief executive
  and artistic officer of BlackStar Projects, created the festival with her
  friends and colleagues out of what she saw as a dearth of showcases featuring
  Black film-makers. Full-time staff for the festival has grown from none in its
  first eight years to 20 this year. BlackStar Projects has also expanded
  programming to include Seen, a twice-yearly journal featuring art and writings
  by Black, brown and Indigenous people. The group also hosted a seminar for
  cinematic artists of color in Palo Alto, California, in March. Four
  film-makers of color were selected for BlackStar’s 2025 yearlong fellowship,
  in which they each received $50,000 in production funding, mentorship and
  their films will premiere at this year’s festival. BlackStar Projects has also
  helped organize and curate multimedia exhibitions throughout Philadelphia for
  nearly a decade. For Holmes, the annual festival goes beyond representation by
  not only ensuring that the films feature Black and brown actors, but also that
  they explore themes often overlooked by mainstream showcases, such as global
  solidarity and social justice. “I think it’s important for people whose
  stories often end up on the margins, to have a space where they are centered
  so that they can, in ways, find respite, joy and comfort,” Holmes said. “A lot
  of film-makers talk about the audiences of the festival looking like their
  friends and family, where in a lot of the mainstream festival circuit, it’s
  often people who are not like the film-maker.” When Khader selects films for
  the festival, she said that she looks for ones that “have their finger on the
  pulse of the moment, socially, politically, economically, environmentally”.
  Since viewers are based around the world, she chooses films that reflect
  global themes. For instance, the feature narrative All That’s Left of You by
  Cherien Dabis navigates intergenerational trauma as a Palestinian mother
  recounts the 70 years of events that led her teenage son to be confronted by
  an Israeli soldier at a West Bank protest. Under the theme of legacy and
  grief, the documentary Third Act by Tadashi Nakamura is about his film-maker
  father, Robert Nakamura, a seminal figure in Asian American media who was
  diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Black motherhood is explored in Listen to
  Me by the first-time film-makers Stephanie Etienne, a midwife and herbalist,
  and Kanika Harris, an executive director at the non-profit the National
  Association to Advance Black Birth, where she focuses on reproductive health;
  Holmes said that their “urgent justice-oriented work” reflects an ethos that
  BlackStar looks for in films. The feature documentary follows three Black
  women facing institutional racism on their journey to motherhood. Amid the
  exploration of joy and pain in the films, the festival’s culture is akin to a
  family reunion, said Holmes. In its 14th year, some viewers attended as babies
  and have grown up along with the festival. “It’s a homecoming for the
  film-makers,” Holmes said, “but it now also feels like a homecoming for the
  attendees.” • The article was amended on 4 August 2025 to include the name of
  Monica Henriquez, the joint director of TCB – the Toni Cade Bambara School of
  Organizing, which had been omitted in error.
