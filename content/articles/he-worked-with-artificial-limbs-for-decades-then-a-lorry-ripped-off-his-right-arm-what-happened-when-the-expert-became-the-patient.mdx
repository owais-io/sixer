  When the air ambulance brought Jim Ashworth-Beaumont to King’s College
  hospital in south-east London, nobody thought he had a hope. He had been
  cycling home when a lorry driver failed to spot him alongside his trailer
  while turning left after a set of traffic lights. The vehicle’s wheels opened
  his torso like a sardine tin, puncturing his lungs and splitting his liver in
  two. They also tore off his right arm. Weeks after the accident, in July 2020,
  Ashworth-Beaumont would see a photo of the severed limb taken by a doctor
  while it lay beside him in hospital. He had asked to see the picture and says
  it helped him come to terms with his loss. “My hand didn’t look too bad,” he
  says. “It was as if it was waving goodbye to me.” Ashworth-Beaumont, a
  super-fit and sunny former Royal Marine from Edinburgh, would go on to spend
  six weeks in an induced coma as surgeons raced to repair his crushed body. But
  as he lay on the road, waiting for the paramedics, his only thoughts were that
  he was dying. He did not have the wherewithal to consider the irony of his
  predicament. In the late 1990s, after he had left the marines,
  Ashworth-Beaumont, now 59, studied for a degree in prosthetics and orthotics
  at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Clinicians in these disciplines
  help patients with pain, function and mobility by making and fitting devices
  such as prosthetic limbs and orthotic braces. He had written research papers
  and trained prosthetists while specialising as an orthotist at the Royal
  National Orthopaedic hospital (RNOH) in north-west London. “Now I was the
  patient,” he says. I meet Ashworth-Beaumont for the first time in Greenwich
  Park, near the south London home he shares with his wife, Keri, a solicitor he
  met on a night out in 2002. It’s early summer 2024, almost four years after
  the accident in nearby Catford. He speaks softly through a smile that cracks
  only when he considers how far he has come and the support he has had:
  “Without Keri, I think I would have sat in a corner and wasted away.” At
  first, his missing arm was a low priority for Edmund Fitzgerald O’Connor, the
  plastic surgeon who attended to his horrific abdominal injuries. But, by
  another twist of fate, the ambitious surgeon, who is 47, had a particular
  interest in limb loss. For years, he had been searching for the perfect
  candidate for a radical procedure he wanted to begin offering to amputees.
  Osseointegration (OI), or direct skeletal fixation, is a relatively new way to
  attach prosthetic limbs. Rather than rely on a socket moulded to fit over a
  residual limb or stump – a method that dates back centuries – arms or legs are
  attached to a titanium implant inserted into the surviving bone (“osseo” means
  bone). Fixing a prosthesis to the implant, which emerges from the stump like a
  little tusk, is as easy as changing a camera lens. OI patients need no longer
  tolerate irritation or infection where the socket rubs against skin and flesh.
  They gain a fuller range of motion and improved control and proprioception –
  the innate sense of where we and our extremities are in space. A prosthesis
  becomes part of the body rather than an awkward appendage. “It feels like I’ve
  got my own leg back,” Hanneke Mooij, a Dutch secretary, tells me three years
  after receiving an implant following decades of torment from ill-fitting
  sockets. At the same time, rapid advances in electronic limbs mean surgeons
  can now effectively wire them into the brain. Taken together, OI and the
  latest prosthetics appear to bring a bionic future within reach. But the
  technique’s evolution has also been fraught, limiting its adoption. In a small
  number of cases, implants or bones have cracked. Painful infections have taken
  hold in the fleshy hole that surgeons must create around the implant. OI is
  also very expensive at a time when amputees struggle to access basic
  prosthetics care. Fitzgerald O’Connor is convinced more of the 25,000 patients
  seen by the NHS prosthetics service each year could benefit from OI. When we
  first meet, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the
  body that issues guidance on NHS treatment and funding, is reviewing OI. “When
  you’re doing 15 to 20 amputations a year and you have patients coming back
  with recurrent problems with their stump, it’s saddening to know there’s a
  viable alternative they can’t access,” he says. The surgeon had been building
  a team to start offering OI, in the private sector at first, when he got the
  call from King’s. He had been searching for a patient who was resilient and in
  good health, who could help drive wider acceptance of the technique. If
  Ashworth-Beaumont could fund his treatment, his professional knowledge of what
  it takes to come back from a traumatic amputation would be a bonus. “You
  couldn’t have made up a better candidate,” Fitzgerald O’Connor says. “The
  conversation started in my mind the day he came in, but I wasn’t going to
  bring it to him until I knew he would survive.” * * * Osseointegration relies
  on a process that was discovered by accident. In the 1950s, Per-Ingvar
  Brånemark, a Swedish scientist based in Gothenburg, put optical devices housed
  in titanium into the legs of rabbits to observe the way bones heal. Once the
  study was over, the metal had fused to the bone and couldn’t be removed,
  defying conventional wisdom about the body’s tendency to reject foreign
  objects. The discovery inspired Brånemark, who died in 2014, to invent dental
  implants, first used in the 1980s, that fuse to the jaw with titanium screws,
  removing the need for dentures. Wondering if the bond could hold larger
  devices, Brånemark and his son, Rickard, an engineer training as an
  orthopaedic surgeon, designed a larger implant. In 1990, they screwed two into
  the above-knee stumps of a woman who had been run over by a tram. The
  procedure was eye-catching, evoking scenes from science fiction – Star Wars or
  The Six Million Dollar Man. It was also divisive. “I remember lecturing in the
  US in the late 90s when this senior professor stood up and said, ‘Only an
  idiot can believe this will ever work,’” says Rickard Brånemark, 65, who
  founded Integrum, the first OI company, in 1998. But a handful of enterprising
  surgeons saw an irresistible logic in bone-anchored prosthetics. Integrum soon
  had competition. In Sydney, Australia, Munjed Al Muderis, an Iraqi-born
  orthopaedic surgeon who had fled Saddam Hussein’s regime after refusing to cut
  off the ears of draft dodgers, developed his own device, which he first
  implanted in 2008. He says patients have received more than 2,000 of his
  implants, which are hammered rather than screwed into bone. (Brånemark says
  surgeons have installed more than 700 Integrum devices.) Al Muderis, 52, is
  the technique’s most bullish advocate. He is now offering it to victims of
  vascular conditions including diabetes, the biggest cause of leg amputations.
  (Other surgeons typically turn down such candidates, fearing their
  rehabilitation could be hampered by lifestyle factors.) “There is a big
  opportunity for this technology to take over from the traditional
  socket-mounted prosthesis,” Al Muderis insists via Zoom as he changes out of
  his scrubs. The surgeon tells me about a current case he says demonstrates
  OI’s potential – a seven-year-old Iraqi orphan who lost an arm in a roadside
  dog attack while he slept. He was later adopted by a wealthy Chinese family.
  In the coming months, Al Muderis plans to fit the boy with an implant, which
  will need to be replaced as he grows. Unlike other OI surgeons, he argues that
  children can be suitable candidates despite the need for further operations.
  In the case of leg amputees, he says, OI gets children walking again sooner.
  “It’s all a balance,” he adds, pointing out that sockets in children need
  changing a lot more often than OI implants. The boy will also undergo a
  procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), which involves rerouting
  amputated nerves. This can help relieve pain in the stump, where the severed
  nerves can thicken into tumour-like neuromas. Remarkably, it can also help
  amputees control prosthetic limbs with their minds. To achieve this, Al
  Muderis will surgically attach the severed nerves, which had travelled to
  muscles in the boy’s arm and hand, to small, inessential sections of muscle in
  his chest instead. Tiny electrodes implanted under the skin will connect these
  muscle sites to the prosthetic arm via eight cables wired through the body and
  the titanium implant. When the boy moves to grab a water bottle, his brain
  will activate the chest muscles, which will forward the signal to the
  corresponding motors in his arm and hand. “It’s amazing because the
  transmission is instant,” Al Muderis says of TMR, which he adds is not yet
  widely available. Integrum has also adapted its implants to allow amputees to
  upgrade to TMR and other advanced control systems in the future. Yet Al
  Muderis – who, like Brånemark, has been to Ukraine to offer OI to injured
  soldiers – says scepticism holds back the technique, including in the UK. He
  partly blames regulations and resistance to the idea of an implant that
  perforates the skin: “This is a completely revolutionary technology which
  violates many of the principles of orthopaedics.” Brånemark is more
  conservative but also thinks far more amputees could benefit than the few
  thousand globally who have implants. When Fitzgerald O’Connor told him about
  his plans and the unlikely case of the one-armed prosthetist, the Swedish
  surgeon agreed to back his British OI team and oversee its first operation. “A
  lot of people still don’t know about OI, even in Sweden,” Brånemark says. “As
  someone who also works in the field, Ashworth-Beaumont can be a really good
  advocate.” * * * For weeks, HIs life hung in the balance. He had lost almost
  all liver and kidney function. Sepsis set in as he lay in a coma. His first
  wife and their two grown-up children came down from Scotland to say goodbye.
  “The first thing I remember, coming out of the coma, was my daughter’s face;
  it’s still a really strong image in my mind,” Ashworth-Beaumont says. He
  thinks he inherited his fighting spirit from his father, a docker’s son from
  Liverpool, who worked as a bellboy before becoming a successful restaurateur.
  His mother still runs a gift shop in her 80s. He also has childhood memories
  of a cousin who lost his legs in a car crash. “I guess amputation was always
  on my radar,” he says. After struggling to focus at school, at 16 he joined
  the marines, where he excelled. Fitness was a passion, and he became skilled
  in mechanical and electronic engineering, which led to his prosthetics career.
  In the final year of his degree, begun in 1996, he worked at Steeper, a
  British prosthetics firm that would one day supply his motorised elbow. He
  joined the RNOH in 2005 while racing in triathlons and moonlighting as a
  personal trainer. He was at peak fitness when the lorry hit him. While amazed
  to be alive, Ashworth-Beaumont realised his limitations as soon as he tried to
  shift his weight around in his hospital bed. “I knew these things
  professionally, but it really brings it home when you first try to move your
  shoulder and nothing happens.” As his vital organs rallied, he became
  determined to return to work. He would need a highly functional prosthesis;
  his job is physical, requiring the manipulation of limbs, as well as the
  making and fitting of devices. He was all ears when Fitzgerald O’Connor shared
  his plans. He also knew it would take time, and that the advice in prosthetics
  care is to try standard devices first. It was almost a year after his
  accident, when he was about to return to work, that Ashworth-Beaumont received
  a body-powered arm on the NHS. These mechanical devices are a step up from
  static prostheses, which can incorporate hooks or skin-coloured hands. By
  rounding his shoulders, he could open a metal claw attached by a cable to a
  back harness: “It works, but the technology has been around for hundreds of
  years.” Socket attachments date back to the 16th century or earlier. Designs
  and materials have changed, but the principle is the same: a socket must grip
  the stump for good function but not so tightly as to cause discomfort. Suction
  helps keep a socket on, but Ashworth-Beaumont needed strapping to pull his
  against his short stump, which further limited comfort and mobility. He ended
  up wearing the arm for just a few hours a day at work, and describes a
  circular problem for arm amputees. The motivation to use a prosthetic leg is
  high, to avoid relying on crutches or a wheelchair: “But there’s so much we
  can still do with one arm.” Patients tend to get frustrated with prosthetic
  arms, often stashing them away and making do. Ashworth-Beaumont says this
  partly explains a reluctance in the NHS to offer advanced devices,
  particularly early on. “But the problem is they’re also not giving people the
  opportunity to try these components when so many of us would benefit.” He went
  private to get a better arm sooner, using money raised from a legal settlement
  with the lorry company and a family crowdfunder. Working with Alan McDougall,
  a prosthetist at Proactive, a private clinic in Surrey, he upgraded to a
  stealthy black electric device with motors in the elbow, wrist and hand. He
  learned to flex his residual biceps and triceps independently to activate the
  motors, via sensors built into the socket. Subtle hand movements allowed him
  to adopt different grips. It’s a step below TMR, but it works: I see it in
  action when we next meet and Ashworth-Beaumont gives me one of the firmest
  handshakes I’ve had. The electric arm, which is worth more than £100,000,
  meant he could do more, but it further exposed his socket’s shortcomings. It
  was heavier than the NHS device, requiring a tighter, less comfortable fit. He
  could pick up a mug, say, but the flesh interface also made it hard to
  position the hand precisely, creating a lag between brain and hand. OI
  increasingly felt like the solution. Ashworth-Beaumont considered himself an
  overqualified guinea pig with an opportunity to highlight his profession and
  widen access to the latest tech. “I see it almost as a duty to explore the
  possibilities,” he told me in 2021, when I first got in touch. * * *
  Ashworth-Beaumont would not be the first British amputee to receive an
  Integrum implant. Starting in the late 90s, Brånemark’s new devices were used
  in a trial involving 18 patients at Queen Mary’s hospital in Roehampton,
  south-west London, where the modern British prosthetics industry emerged after
  the first world war. While the trial had some success and provided valuable
  data, the experience of its least fortunate participants still reverberates
  around the field and the debate about NHS provision. Gemma Trotter, a fitness
  instructor from south London, was 16 when she had a leg amputated above the
  knee after a car crash. Held back for years by uncomfortable sockets, she set
  aside her reservations about OI, which she had viewed as “crackers”, and
  joined the trial in 2003, aged 21. It was transformative. “Suddenly I could
  feel the floor through my leg again. If I wore jeans, a lot of people didn’t
  even know I was an amputee,” she says. “I got married, had a baby … they were
  the best nine years of my life.” Then the implant broke and became infected.
  By then the trial team had disbanded, limiting follow-up care. Trotter, now
  42, has endured more than a decade of pain and attempted fixes by surgeons
  including Brånemark. She is waiting to have her third implant removed after
  more problems, and won’t risk having another. (Brånemark tells me that, while
  there is a risk of failure with any implant, Integrum’s success rate has
  significantly improved since the Roehampton trial.) Trotter remains one of
  only a few dozen patients in the UK who have had OI, which is more widely
  available in countries with insurance-based health systems. Hanneke Mooij, the
  Dutch patient, is surprised to hear OI is hard to access in the UK. She
  received an Integrum device in 2022, 36 years after losing her leg in a
  motorbike crash. She is part of a Dutch group of 20 one-legged female friends
  who call themselves “the flamingos”, half of whom have had OI surgery in the
  past few years. “I’m convinced this is the future,” she says. Most British OI
  recipients are patients at Relimb, a private clinic founded at the Royal Free
  hospital in north-west London in 2018. Its directors, Norbert Kang and Alex
  Woollard, use Al Muderis’s implants and have about 60 patients on their books,
  almost all funded by legal settlements after traumatic accidents. Partly with
  the Roehampton trial in mind, they do not think the NHS has the resources to
  offer the skilled and long-term care required to make OI successful. “No
  matter how beneficial it is and how well we can do it now, we’re not going to
  change health economics,” Woollard says. He and Kang are not alone in having
  doubts. Nicky Eddison, chair of the British Association of Prosthetists and
  Orthotists, says the professions are already facing a staffing and recruitment
  crisis, and some NHS trusts are making do with just two specialists. “Whatever
  technical advances you make, we can’t deliver them without skilled
  clinicians,” she says. Yet proponents of OI make a case for long-term cost
  savings. Stephen Cruse, founder of the Amputation Foundation, a charity in
  Merseyside, had OI surgery with Al Muderis in 2016, eight years after losing
  his legs in a car crash while in Australia. After returning to the UK, he
  convinced an Australian government compensation scheme to fund his surgery
  after calculating it would save money in five years. “They were paying about
  £30,000 a year on sockets, liners and maintenance,” says Cruse, who had a
  “nightmare” with sockets but now rarely needs to see his prosthetist. Last
  December, Nice published new guidelines. It now recommends that OI can be used
  in the NHS but only by multidisciplinary teams with specific training, and the
  NHS tells me its policy – not to offer it widely – isn’t changing, based on
  the risks and its funding priorities. Fitzgerald O’Connor says there may be
  ways to secure funds in exceptional cases, and he will continue to push for
  wider access as evidence of OI’s efficacy grows. “To leave it in a silo, where
  it’s only accessible with vast amounts of money, does a disservice to patients
  who are suffering,” he says. * * * After long delays caused by Covid and
  post-Brexit paperwork, Ashworth-Beaumont finally gets a date for his private
  surgery: a Saturday in October 2024. “I tend to take things in my stride, but
  it feels like jumping out of a plane,” he tells me a few weeks before the
  operation. “You know the systems are there to protect you, but there’s always
  that 1% chance things could go awry.” The day before the surgery, which will
  take place at St Thomas’s hospital in central London, I join Ashworth-Beaumont
  at a private clinic farther up the Thames at Battersea power station.
  Fitzgerald O’Connor and Aaron Saini, an orthopaedic surgeon who is also part
  of the new OI team, have gathered amputees and professionals to discuss this
  case and prosthetics technology more widely. The subject of NHS care keeps
  cropping up. Craig Mackinlay, a former Conservative MP from Kent, lost all
  four limbs to sepsis in 2023. Five months later, he received a standing
  ovation when he strode into the House of Commons wearing prostheses.
  Fitzgerald O’Connor, who performed the amputations, looked on from the public
  gallery. It was a triumphant comeback, but Mackinlay has since highlighted NHS
  shortcomings, including long waits and early black rubber prostheses that
  resembled “clubs … I couldn’t see what they’d be good for apart from breaking
  windows or pub fights.” Mackinlay, now a life peer, has since gone private,
  with support from device firms and his own money. In a debate in the Lords
  this May, he said he would still be in a wheelchair had he not accessed better
  legs sooner. “The technology is out there and the NHS will give some of it to
  you, but it takes years,” he says. “Why are we holding people back?” In
  response, Baroness Merron, a health minister, announced a review of the
  provision of advanced prostheses. In a statement, an NHS spokesperson insists
  that it “provides a comprehensive package of care and support for people who
  have lost limbs, including a range of prosthetics”. When I ask
  Ashworth-Beaumont if everything is starting to feel a bit real, he takes a
  deep breath. “This is all positive,” he says, his voice cracking. “Sorry, I’m
  just thinking about the last four years.” Fitzgerald O’Connor places a hand on
  his shoulder. “It was tough, but you made it,” he says. The next morning,
  Brånemark, Fitzgerald O’Connor and Saini screw the Integrum implant into
  Ashworth-Beaumont’s humerus, carefully rebuilding his soft tissue around it.
  “I’ve been walking around like I’m made of crystal,” he tells me two days
  later via Zoom as he waits for bone and metal to bond. Not long after
  Christmas, he is ready for an arm. McDougall has adapted Ashworth-Beaumont’s
  body-powered device so he can attach it to his implant. Even with the
  encumbrance of the cable and harness needed to move the hand, he is struck by
  the enhanced control of a firmly anchored limb. “I went out for dinner with
  Keri for my birthday and used a knife and fork properly,” he says. “I feel
  more competent as an individual.” By early March he is ready to go full
  bionic, connecting his heavier electric arm. At Proactive, plaster casts of
  stumps stand like sculptures in the workshop. As well as adapting the more
  advanced arm, McDougall has added a small cuff to house the muscle sensors
  that used to sit inside Ashworth-Beaumont’s socket. The arm would look at home
  in a sci-fi props department, with its carbon fibre-effect shell and
  translucent glove, which reveals some of the hand’s moving parts. Then there’s
  the gap in the upper arm, where only the titanium implant links flesh to
  hardware. Yet when the prosthesis hangs from Ashworth-Beaumont’s shoulder, it
  somehow looks like part of him. Without the socket and straps, his silhouette
  is symmetrical: he is whole again. Soon motors whirr as he tests his bionic
  joints, raising his arm above his head in a way he hasn’t been able to do
  since the accident. McDougall adjusts it using a Bluetooth-connected iPad app.
  “This is really good,” Ashworth-Beaumont says as he picks up a stray screw
  from a workbench. Within days, he’s performing tasks previously beyond him.
  Hoovering feels like a privilege. Five years after his old arm appeared to
  wave goodbye, Ashworth-Beaumont is as aware as anyone of the limitations of
  the health service. “I’ve spent, what, five hours with Alan today, there’s no
  way you’d get that time in the NHS,” he says. While he watches the OI debate
  continue, returning to his own NHS job has felt like his biggest achievement.
  As well as being able to meet the physical demands of his work, his ordeal has
  changed his relationship with patients. “I was quite emotional about it after
  my first few appointments,” he says. “I really did know how they felt.”

He was later adopted by a wealthy Chinese family. In the coming months, Al Muderis plans to fit the boy with an implant, which will need to be replaced as he grows. Unlike other OI surgeons, he argues that children can be suitable candidates despite the need for further operations. In the case of leg amputees, he says, OI gets children walking again sooner. “It’s all a balance,” he adds, pointing out that sockets in children need changing a lot more often than OI implants. The boy will also undergo a procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), which involves rerouting amputated nerves. This can help relieve pain in the stump, where the severed nerves can thicken into tumour-like neuromas. Remarkably, it can also help amputees control prosthetic limbs with their minds. To achieve this, Al Muderis will surgically attach the severed nerves, which had travelled to muscles in the boy’s arm and hand, to small, inessential sections of muscle in his chest instead. Tiny electrodes implanted under the skin will connect these muscle sites to the prosthetic arm via eight cables wired through the body and the titanium implant. When the boy moves to grab a water bottle, his brain will activate the chest muscles, which will forward the signal to the corresponding motors in his arm and hand. “It’s amazing because the transmission is instant,” Al Muderis says of TMR, which he adds is not yet widely available. Integrum has also adapted its implants to allow amputees to upgrade to TMR and other advanced control systems in the future. Yet Al Muderis – who, like Brånemark, has been to Ukraine to offer OI to injured soldiers – says scepticism holds back the technique, including in the UK. He partly blames regulations and resistance to the idea of an implant that perforates the skin: “This is a completely revolutionary technology which violates many of the principles of orthopaedics.” Brånemark is more conservative but also thinks far more amputees could benefit than the few thousand globally who have implants. When Fitzgerald O’Connor told him about his plans and the unlikely case of the one-armed prosthetist, the Swedish surgeon agreed to back his British OI team and oversee its first operation. “A lot of people still don’t know about OI, even in Sweden,” Brånemark says. “As someone who also works in the field, Ashworth-Beaumont can be a really good advocate.” * * * For weeks, HIs life hung in the balance. He had lost almost all liver and kidney function. Sepsis set in as he lay in a coma. His first wife and their two grown-up children came down from Scotland to say goodbye. “The first thing I remember, coming out of the coma, was my daughter’s face; it’s still a really strong image in my mind,” Ashworth-Beaumont says. He thinks he inherited his fighting spirit from his father, a docker’s son from Liverpool, who worked as a bellboy before becoming a successful restaurateur. His mother still runs a gift shop in her 80s. He also has childhood memories of a cousin who lost his legs in a car crash. “I guess amputation was always on my radar,” he says. After struggling to focus at school, at 16 he joined the marines, where he excelled. Fitness was a passion, and he became skilled in mechanical and electronic engineering, which led to his prosthetics career. In the final year of his degree, begun in 1996, he worked at Steeper, a British prosthetics firm that would one day supply his motorised elbow. He joined the RNOH in 2005 while racing in triathlons and moonlighting as a personal trainer. He was at peak fitness when the lorry hit him. While amazed to be alive, Ashworth-Beaumont realised his limitations as soon as he tried to shift his weight around in his hospital bed. “I knew these things professionally, but it really brings it home when you first try to move your shoulder and nothing happens.” As his vital organs rallied, he became determined to return to work. He would need a highly functional prosthesis; his job is physical, requiring the manipulation of limbs, as well as the making and fitting of devices. He was all ears when Fitzgerald O’Connor shared his plans. He also knew it would take time, and that the advice in prosthetics care is to try standard devices first. It was almost a year after his accident, when he was about to return to work, that Ashworth-Beaumont received a body-powered arm on the NHS. These mechanical devices are a step up from static prostheses, which can incorporate hooks or skin-coloured hands. By rounding his shoulders, he could open a metal claw attached by a cable to a back harness: “It works, but the technology has been around for hundreds of years.” Socket attachments date back to the 16th century or earlier. Designs and materials have changed, but the principle is the same: a socket must grip the stump for good function but not so tightly as to cause discomfort. Suction helps keep a socket on, but Ashworth-Beaumont needed strapping to pull his against his short stump, which further limited comfort and mobility. He ended up wearing the arm for just a few hours a day at work, and describes a circular problem for arm amputees. The motivation to use a prosthetic leg is high, to avoid relying on crutches or a wheelchair: “But there’s so much we can still do with one arm.” Patients tend to get frustrated with prosthetic arms, often stashing them away and making do. Ashworth-Beaumont says this partly explains a reluctance in the NHS to offer advanced devices, particularly early on. “But the problem is they’re also not giving people the opportunity to try these components when so many of us would benefit.” He went private to get a better arm sooner, using money raised from a legal settlement with the lorry company and a family crowdfunder. Working with Alan McDougall, a prosthetist at Proactive, a private clinic in Surrey, he upgraded to a stealthy black electric device with motors in the elbow, wrist and hand. He learned to flex his residual biceps and triceps independently to activate the motors, via sensors built into the socket. Subtle hand movements allowed him to adopt different grips. It’s a step below TMR, but it works: I see it in action when we next meet and Ashworth-Beaumont gives me one of the firmest handshakes I’ve had. The electric arm, which is worth more than £100,000, meant he could do more, but it further exposed his socket’s shortcomings. It was heavier than the NHS device, requiring a tighter, less comfortable fit. He could pick up a mug, say, but the flesh interface also made it hard to position the hand precisely, creating a lag between brain and hand. OI increasingly felt like the solution. Ashworth-Beaumont considered himself an overqualified guinea pig with an opportunity to highlight his profession and widen access to the latest tech. “I see it almost as a duty to explore the possibilities,” he told me in 2021, when I first got in touch. * * * Ashworth-Beaumont would not be the first British amputee to receive an Integrum implant. Starting in the late 90s, Brånemark’s new devices were used in a trial involving 18 patients at Queen Mary’s hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, where the modern British prosthetics industry emerged after the first world war. While the trial had some success and provided valuable data, the experience of its least fortunate participants still reverberates around the field and the debate about NHS provision. Gemma Trotter, a fitness instructor from south London, was 16 when she had a leg amputated above the knee after a car crash. Held back for years by uncomfortable sockets, she set aside her reservations about OI, which she had viewed as “crackers”, and joined the trial in 2003, aged 21. It was transformative. “Suddenly I could feel the floor through my leg again. If I wore jeans, a lot of people didn’t even know I was an amputee,” she says. “I got married, had a baby … they were the best nine years of my life.” Then the implant broke and became infected. By then the trial team had disbanded, limiting follow-up care. Trotter, now 42, has endured more than a decade of pain and attempted fixes by surgeons including Brånemark. She is waiting to have her third implant removed after more problems, and won’t risk having another. (Brånemark tells me that, while there is a risk of failure with any implant, Integrum’s success rate has significantly improved since the Roehampton trial.) Trotter remains one of only a few dozen patients in the UK who have had OI, which is more widely available in countries with insurance-based health systems. Hanneke Mooij, the Dutch patient, is surprised to hear OI is hard to access in the UK. She received an Integrum device in 2022, 36 years after losing her leg in a motorbike crash. She is part of a Dutch group of 20 one-legged female friends who call themselves “the flamingos”, half of whom have had OI surgery in the past few years. “I’m convinced this is the future,” she says. Most British OI recipients are patients at Relimb, a private clinic founded at the Royal Free hospital in north-west London in 2018. Its directors, Norbert Kang and Alex Woollard, use Al Muderis’s implants and have about 60 patients on their books, almost all funded by legal settlements after traumatic accidents. Partly with the Roehampton trial in mind, they do not think the NHS has the resources to offer the skilled and long-term care required to make OI successful. “No matter how beneficial it is and how well we can do it now, we’re not going to change health economics,” Woollard says. He and Kang are not alone in having doubts. Nicky Eddison, chair of the British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists, says the professions are already facing a staffing and recruitment crisis, and some NHS trusts are making do with just two specialists. “Whatever technical advances you make, we can’t deliver them without skilled clinicians,” she says. Yet proponents of OI make a case for long-term cost savings. Stephen Cruse, founder of the Amputation Foundation, a charity in Merseyside, had OI surgery with Al Muderis in 2016, eight years after losing his legs in a car crash while in Australia. After returning to the UK, he convinced an Australian government compensation scheme to fund his surgery after calculating it would save money in five years. “They were paying about £30,000 a year on sockets, liners and maintenance,” says Cruse, who had a “nightmare” with sockets but now rarely needs to see his prosthetist. Last December, Nice published new guidelines. It now recommends that OI can be used in the NHS but only by multidisciplinary teams with specific training, and the NHS tells me its policy – not to offer it widely – isn’t changing, based on the risks and its funding priorities. Fitzgerald O’Connor says there may be ways to secure funds in exceptional cases, and he will continue to push for wider access as evidence of OI’s efficacy grows. “To leave it in a silo, where it’s only accessible with vast amounts of money, does a disservice to patients who are suffering,” he says. * * * After long delays caused by Covid and post-Brexit paperwork, Ashworth-Beaumont finally gets a date for his private surgery: a Saturday in October 2024. “I tend to take things in my stride, but it feels like jumping out of a plane,” he tells me a few weeks before the operation. “You know the systems are there to protect you, but there’s always that 1% chance things could go awry.” The day before the surgery, which will take place at St Thomas’s hospital in central London, I join Ashworth-Beaumont at a private clinic farther up the Thames at Battersea power station. Fitzgerald O’Connor and Aaron Saini, an orthopaedic surgeon who is also part of the new OI team, have gathered amputees and professionals to discuss this case and prosthetics technology more widely. The subject of NHS care keeps cropping up. Craig Mackinlay, a former Conservative MP from Kent, lost all four limbs to sepsis in 2023. Five months later, he received a standing ovation when he strode into the House of Commons wearing prostheses. Fitzgerald O’Connor, who performed the amputations, looked on from the public gallery. It was a triumphant comeback, but Mackinlay has since highlighted NHS shortcomings, including long waits and early black rubber prostheses that resembled “clubs … I couldn’t see what they’d be good for apart from breaking windows or pub fights.” Mackinlay, now a life peer, has since gone private, with support from device firms and his own money. In a debate in the Lords this May, he said he would still be in a wheelchair had he not accessed better legs sooner. “The technology is out there and the NHS will give some of it to you, but it takes years,” he says. “Why are we holding people back?” In response, Baroness Merron, a health minister, announced a review of the provision of advanced prostheses. In a statement, an NHS spokesperson insists that it “provides a comprehensive package of care and support for people who have lost limbs, including a range of prosthetics”. When I ask Ashworth-Beaumont if everything is starting to feel a bit real, he takes a deep breath. “This is all positive,” he says, his voice cracking. “Sorry, I’m just thinking about the last four years.” Fitzgerald O’Connor places a hand on his shoulder. “It was tough, but you made it,” he says. The next morning, Brånemark, Fitzgerald O’Connor and Saini screw the Integrum implant into Ashworth-Beaumont’s humerus, carefully rebuilding his soft tissue around it. “I’ve been walking around like I’m made of crystal,” he tells me two days later via Zoom as he waits for bone and metal to bond. Not long after Christmas, he is ready for an arm. McDougall has adapted Ashworth-Beaumont’s body-powered device so he can attach it to his implant. Even with the encumbrance of the cable and harness needed to move the hand, he is struck by the enhanced control of a firmly anchored limb. “I went out for dinner with Keri for my birthday and used a knife and fork properly,” he says. “I feel more competent as an individual.” By early March he is ready to go full bionic, connecting his heavier electric arm. At Proactive, plaster casts of stumps stand like sculptures in the workshop. As well as adapting the more advanced arm, McDougall has added a small cuff to house the muscle sensors that used to sit inside Ashworth-Beaumont’s socket. The arm would look at home in a sci-fi props department, with its carbon fibre-effect shell and translucent glove, which reveals some of the hand’s moving parts. Then there’s the gap in the upper arm, where only the titanium implant links flesh to hardware. Yet when the prosthesis hangs from Ashworth-Beaumont’s shoulder, it somehow looks like part of him. Without the socket and straps, his silhouette is symmetrical: he is whole again. Soon motors whirr as he tests his bionic joints, raising his arm above his head in a way he hasn’t been able to do since the accident. McDougall adjusts it using a Bluetooth-connected iPad app. “This is really good,” Ashworth-Beaumont says as he picks up a stray screw from a workbench. Within days, he’s performing tasks previously beyond him. Hoovering feels like a privilege. Five years after his old arm appeared to wave goodbye, Ashworth-Beaumont is as aware as anyone of the limitations of the health service. “I’ve spent, what, five hours with Alan today, there’s no way you’d get that time in the NHS,” he says. While he watches the OI debate continue, returning to his own NHS job has felt like his biggest achievement. As well as being able to meet the physical demands of his work, his ordeal has changed his relationship with patients. “I was quite emotional about it after my first few appointments,” he says. “I really did know how they felt.”
