  TARK ARTS? We can only speculate about what David Moyes would have said in his
  post-match press conference if it had been his team who had been awarded a
  penalty in identical circumstances to those leading to Leeds United scoring
  their winner against Everton last night, but there really isn’t much point.
  Like pretty much every football manager, Everton’s tends to be pretty
  consistent in his view that debatable decisions that go in favour of his
  players are correct and to be commended, while those which go against them are
  not and should be criticised. Twas ever thus, so it was no surprise that when
  James Tarkowski was penalised for deliberately leaning to his left to stop a
  ball that would otherwise have not struck his arm at a febrile Elland Road,
  Moyes decided his player and team had been extremely hard done by, even if did
  seem fairly relaxed and wasn’t in full-on Begbie radge-funk mode. Moyes was
  far from alone in this view, even if those espoused by former players – the
  people that some geniuses would have infiltrate Stockley Park’s bunker of
  squinting windows because they’ve played the game – were wildly divergent. BBC
  pundit Chris Sutton declared the decision “scandalous”, while his Sky Sports
  counterparts Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher agreed referee Chris Kavanagh
  had got it right. “I’m obviously going to say it’s not a penalty and I believe
  it’s not a penalty,” growled Moyes after the game. “I’ve been to see the
  referee. [Kavanagh] sort of took nothing to do with it, he thought it was to
  do with VAR, the decision they’ve made. I don’t know what else I can say.” He
  went on to say plenty as he criticised the standard of refereeing across the
  board over the weekend just gone, even though it seemed largely fine to
  Football Daily apart from one or two minor ricks from officialdom. While the
  misguided reaction of various members of the punditocracy to the entirely
  correct decision to disallow Eberechi Eze’s free-kick for Crystal Palace
  against Chelsea on Sunday demonstrated that no end of former footballers live
  in blissful ignorance of the laws of the game they are now tasked with
  discussing for a living, handball is an entirely different kettle of sea
  bream. Since the introduction of VAR, constant tinkering has rendered the law
  so diluted, murky and subjective that the fabled “consistency” players,
  managers and fans everywhere demand has become impossible to achieve. Indeed,
  it is no exaggeration to say that the handball law has become so opaque and
  open to interpretation, one suspects a good lawyer could argue convincingly
  that each and every one of Moyes, his opposite number Daniel Farke, Sutton,
  Carragher, Neville and all the internet crazies who debated long into the
  night were spot-on in their assessments of how it was applied against
  Tarkowski and Everton. A mess that shows no sign of being tidied up anytime
  soon, handball will continue to be a talking point with each passing match.
  Such was the paucity of quality at Elland Road, it was in fact the only
  talking point from that particular game. QUOTE OF THE DAY “This achievement
  isn’t just ours – it belongs to every girl in Bangladesh who dares to dream.
  It’s proof of what faith, hard work, and unity can achieve. But we’re not
  stopping here. The next few months of preparation will be tough but we are up
  for the challenge” – Bangladesh’s 18-year-old captain, Afeida Khandaker, talks
  to Thaslima Begum about her side’s historic Asian Cup qualification in the
  latest edition of our women’s football newsletter, Moving the Goalposts.
  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Does Football Daily really want a discussion on new
  words to be included in dictionaries [yesterday’s Last Line, full email
  edition]? For a time, I had proposed that the OED include the word ‘fiverish’.
  Common usages included ‘sort of funny, but not overly so’, and ‘tea-timely,
  but certainly not on time’. But then your big FD rebrand made the term
  obsolete. Sigh” – Mike Wilner. Do we need further clarification of the
  handball law to specifically rule on the situation where it is
  arm-fastidiously-stuck-to-his-side-but-still-moved-towards-the-ball to ball?”
