  My friend Paula Heister, who has died aged 40 of cancer, trained in medicine
  and taught the subject at Cambridge University, but she also worked as a
  children’s author and illustrator. A 2025 book, Career Planning for Doctors by
  Caroline and Naomi Elton, features Paula’s illustrations and cites Paula
  herself as an example of doctors taking their careers beyond medical
  boundaries into other domains. Harvard University had recently awarded her a
  fellowship, for a project bridging medicine and art in an exploration of
  dying. Her artwork was exhibited across the UK, in Bologna and in Hamburg. Her
  children’s book, Glow, which was highly commended at the 2023 World
  Illustration awards, used phosphorescent paint to bring a glow-in-the-dark
  rabbit to life and explain the science behind nighttime luminescence. Paula
  also considered medicine through poetry; in 2023 in the journal Ars Medica she
  compared hospital patients’ care to the Japanese art of kintsugi, repairing
  broken pottery with gold-inflected lacquer. She was born in Münsterlingen,
  Switzerland. Her father, Peter Schroeder-Heister, is a professor of logic; her
  mother, Gabi Heister, was an experimental neuropsychologist. In 1989 the
  family moved to Tübingen, south Germany, and then to London in 1997 when
  Paula’s father took a sabbatical at University College London; she went to the
  German school, in Richmond upon Thames, and then Marymount International
  school in Kingston upon Thames. When the family returned to Germany, she
  completed her schooling at the International school in Stuttgart. On her
  return to Britain Paula studied psychology, philosophy and physiology at St
  Hilda’s College, Oxford. Receiving prizes at each stage, she continued through
  Oxford with a doctorate in pharmacology. She was president of Oxford
  University fencing club, where she met Chris Jones, who was a postgraduate at
  St Anne’s College, and they married in 2023. Paula went on to train in
  medicine at Imperial College London, and also worked as a model. From 2020 she
  taught medicine at Cambridge, and was a bye-fellow at Downing College, while
  she completed a master’s degree in children’s book illustration at the
  Cambridge School of Art, Anglia Ruskin University. I first met Paula in 2009,
  at a 7am fencing training session in Oxford. She was hilarious, droll and
  loving – a person to whom you told everything. She was more relentlessly
  upbeat and idealistic than anyone I knew, and more sweary (she learned English
  from the TV show Father Ted). Even when ill, she put others first. “Keep
  starting over,” she wrote in a graduation message composed for her Cambridge
  medical students. “You are not one thing. As humans we are all scientists, and
  all artists, and all athletes, and all potential saints.” Paula and Chris
  divided their time between Cambridge and Austria, where Chris was teaching at
  the University of Vienna. She gave her last energies to becoming my son’s
  godmother in the Vienna General hospital chapel, planning readings, hymns and,
  typically, gifts. Paula is survived by Chris, her parents, Gabi and Peter, her
  brother, Justin, and niece, Julia.
