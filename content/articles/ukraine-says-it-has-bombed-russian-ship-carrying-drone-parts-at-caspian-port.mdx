  Ukraine says it has conducted a long-range drone attack on a supply ship that
  it claims was carrying drone components from Iran, striking it at a port north
  of the Caspian Sea, in a show of force hours before Donald Trump and Vladimir
  Putin meet for a summit in Alaska. Photographs showed a partially sunken cargo
  vessel at Olya, near Astrakhan, more than 500 miles from the frontline.
  Ukraine’s military claimed credit for the attack and the overnight bombing of
  an oil refinery at Samara on the Volga River, deep inside Russia. Ukraine’s
  general staff said the ship hit, the Port Olya-4, was “loaded with components”
  for Shahed-type drones “and ammunition from Iran”. The port, it added, was an
  “important logistics hub for the supply of military goods”. Kyiv’s forces have
  repeatedly shown they can strike military logistics and energy targets
  hundreds of miles inside Russia, although the attacks only appear to have a
  dampening impact on the Kremlin’s long-term war effort. As the US president
  prepares to meet his Russian counterpart in Alaska to discuss ending the
  Ukraine war and other bilateral issues, Ukraine remains under pressure in the
  battle on land, as demonstrated by a breach in its defences in the eastern
  Donbas last weekend. Several Russian saboteur groups pierced the Ukrainian
  frontlines by about 6 miles in a strategically important part of the front in
  Donetsk province near the road junction of Dobropillya, where supply routes
  had passed east to Kramatorsk. On Friday troops from Kyiv’s elite Azov Corps
  were leading efforts alongside the 79th and 82nd brigades to mop up the
  infiltration, but the breach, while apparently contained, has not been
  eliminated. On Friday Ukraine’s president, Voldoymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine
  was succeeding in “countering the attempts of Russian forces to gain a
  foothold” – and said a decision had been made to further reinforce the sector
  and the regional frontline. Troop shortages and the sheer length of the active
  frontline, at more than 600 miles long, mean the point of contact is not
  continuously held. Instead, it is made up of a series of foxholes that Russian
  attackers seek to sneak past using small lightly armed deep reconnaissance
  groups (DRGs). An intense Russian effort to achieve drone superiority in the
  sector since early May has made it more difficult for Ukraine to repel the
  infiltrators, according to Sam Cranny-Evans, a military analyst with the Royal
  United Services Institute thinktank. The Russians, he said, had established
  “some form of aerial dominance” over the Pokrovsk area that had “enabled them
  to work on further isolating Ukrainian units in the area, hitting logistics
  vehicles moving to and from the front, as well as troop rotations”. Ukraine,
  he believed, may “struggle to respond to a breakthrough with the available
  forces” as a result, a challenge compounded by the fact that units such as the
  Azov that are thrown into the frontline to deal with Russian infiltrations
  “are already stressed and extended from several recent deployments”. Earlier
  this week, Zelenskyy described the attack as politically timed, and said
  Russia would use it to try to show US leaders it was gradually winning the war
  and that continuing support for Kyiv would be wasted. On Friday, referencing
  the summit, the president added: “The Russian army continues to suffer
  significant losses in its attempts to secure more favourable political
  positions for the Russian leadership at the meeting in Alaska.” Ukraine’s
  military released images of what appeared to be a significant fire at the
  Syzran oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region. The plant, the general staff
  said, “produces a wide range of fuels, including aviation kerosene” and
  supplied the country’s military. The Russian governor of Samara said a drone
  attack caused a fire at an unspecified “industrial enterprise” but that it had
  been put out quickly. The Shahed drones that bomb Ukraine’s cities nightly
  were designed in Iran, and earlier in the war Russia was dependent on supply
  from Tehran, with shipments travelling over the Caspian Sea between the two
  countries. However, Russia now makes Shahed drones in two factories of its own
  after the technology was shared – meaning Iran, also weakened after its own
  war with Israel, is a less significant military support.
