  Cloudbreak, near the island of Tavarua in western Fiji, is one of the best
  waves in the world. For decades, the long, hollow left-hand reef break has
  drawn surfers from around the globe; later this year, the men’s and women’s
  World Surf League (WSL) champions will be crowned at Cloudbreak. But until
  2010, local surfers were forbidden from surfing the wave due to an exclusivity
  deal with a nearby surf resort. That year, Fiji’s cabinet made a decision, “to
  liberalise access to any surfing area”. Cloudbreak was exclusive no more. A
  decade and a half later, in no small part thanks to that cabinet decision,
  Fiji has its first professional surfer. “I’m so lucky,” says James Kusitino,
  who recently signed a team rider deal with surfwear brand Former. “It opened
  in 2010, and I was born in 2009. Cloudbreak is the best wave in the world.”
  Kusitino has been in the water since he was a baby. His middle name –
  Wainisomu – means “drinking water” in English. Whenever Kusitino was
  distressed as a baby, his parents would put him in a tub of water and he would
  stop crying. “I have a passion for the ocean,” he says. The Fijian started
  surfing as a four-year-old and he was charging Cloudbreak – a famously
  challenging wave – before reaching double digits. Kusitino still recalls his
  first competition at Cloudbreak, aged eight or nine. “It was huge, it was
  massive,” he says. “I remember seeing the biggest barrel in my life – I was so
  scared.” Today, Kusitino surfs almost constantly and he has dropped out of
  school to pursue the sport. Kusitino’s mother tells the Guardian that evenings
  are the best time to contact her son, “as he’s usually out surfing.” ‘I want
  to beat the number one’ Kusitino is not the Pacific nation’s first high-level
  surfer; Tevita Gukilau competed in the WSL event at Cloudbreak as a wildcard,
  while Che Slatter – Kusitino’s mentor – is another local standout. But the
  16-year-old’s team rider deal with Former elevates him as the future of Fijian
  surfing, the first local with sufficient sponsor backing to pursue the sport
  full-time. “I’m so proud to be the first professional surfer in Fiji,” he
  says. “There could have been 50 pro surfers from Fiji, but because they locked
  up the wave – we didn’t get to surf Cloudbreak with all these people. I think
  there would have been already some professional surfers if Cloudbreak was open
  [in the past].” Former signed Kusitino after one of its co-founders, South
  African-Australian free surfer Craig Anderson, spotted him on recent trips to
  Cloudbreak. “Every time he’s blown me away,” Anderson said. “His raw talent
  and unique approach in waves of consequence are like nothing I’ve seen before.
  In the water, he’s completely in his own world. To me, James is the most
  gifted 16-year-old surfer on the planet.” With the brand’s support, Kusitino
  has big plans. “I want to do a few comps,” he says. “I want to do the Eddie
  [the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational – a prestigious event in Hawaii]. I’m
  going to Teahupo’o [a famously heavy wave in Tahiti] this year, put in my time
  there,” In late August, the world’s best surfers will come to Cloudbreak to
  decide the WSL championships, in the last edition of the “final five” format.
  Changes to the competition structure mean that from next year onwards, the
  Fiji Pro will again feature local trials and a wildcard spot in the main draw.
  Kusitino is undaunted by the prospect of surfing against the world’s best,
  perhaps as soon as mid-next year. “I want to beat the number one seed,”
  Kusitino says. “And maybe be the first local to win the whole thing.” A decade
  and a half on from the democratisation of the nation’s waves the future seems
  bright for Fijian surfing. Even at the young age of 16, Kusitino says he
  already sees young surfers following in his footsteps. “There are already
  great locals coming out,” he says. “I’m happy to see them out there.”
