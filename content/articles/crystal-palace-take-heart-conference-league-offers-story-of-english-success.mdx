  It is hard to imagine Uefa will be spared the wrath of Selhurst Park when
  Crystal Palace begin Conference League life there on Thursday night. A
  red-letter event in the club’s history has been soured by their demotion from
  the Europa League and the sight of Norway’s cup winners, Fredrikstad,
  mid-table in the Eliteserien, lining up against Oliver Glasner’s players will
  hardly lend itself to a sense of glamour. For all the burning sense of
  injustice, there is a clear upside for Palace. They will probably never have a
  better chance of European success if history and raw numbers are measures to
  go by. Any Premier League club should start as hot favourites to win the
  continent’s third-tier competition, such is their financial advantage over all
  of the contenders. That status has been justified in two of its four editions
  and there is inspiration to be taken from the scenes of joy when West Ham and
  Chelsea took the trophy home. There is also a warning sign for the tournament
  itself. The Conference League was intended to provide smaller and medium-sized
  nations with a larger and longer dose of European football, notionally
  offering some of them a shot at going the distance. So the bigger picture did
  not look especially edifying when West Ham, who had finished 14th in the
  Premier League, beat Fiorentina in the 2023 final. The alarm bells rang even
  louder when Chelsea, at best deigning to field second-string sides for most of
  the competition, strolled to glory with a goal difference of 45-12. Is the
  future really a carve-up between English clubs and, if so, to what extent does
  that matter? During discussions about the Conference League’s creation in the
  second half of the last decade, there was serious debate about whether teams
  from the “big five” countries would be invited to participate at all. It was
  eventually decided that excluding them would, as well as reducing the event’s
  sporting merit, mean turning down an obvious opportunity. For many minnows,
  the attention gained by drawing a giant might be genuinely transformative.
  That would certainly be the case if the San Marino champions AC Virtus, an
  improbable presence in the playoff round, somehow defeat the Icelanders
  Breidablik and reach the league phase. It is partly why there were few tears
  at Djurgården, the eight-time Allsvenskan winners but hitherto a peripheral
  presence in Europe, when they were beaten 5-1 on aggregate by Chelsea in last
  season’s semi-finals. Getting that far and being able to host one of Europe’s
  celebrated names constituted a historic progression into new territory,
  however the result turned out. Their travelling fans had little problem
  enjoying a virtually dead second leg at Stamford Bridge. Insiders at Uefa and
  the increasingly powerful European Club Association have little patience with
  any idea that the Conference League is flawed, either in concept or execution.
  They can point out that 29 different countries were represented in last
  season’s league phase, which stands in wild contrast to the 16 whose sides
  competed in the Champions League and 22 in the Europa League. All
  representatives will receive a baseline £2.7m sum and the feedback has been
  that clubs are content. It is a rich cross-section of interests and cultures.
  The victories by Roma and Olympiakos, in 2022 and 2024 respectively, add
  weight to the argument that anyone bemoaning English dominance is jumping the
  gun. A longer-term view must be taken before discerning whether the Conference
  League suffers the same problems that ultimately dogged the Cup Winners’ Cup,
  which provided its own enjoyable ragtag group of contenders until the late
  1990s. The now defunct competition’s last 11 editions were won by teams from
  England, Spain, Italy, Germany or France, a trend coinciding almost precisely
  with the Champions League’s creation and subsequent expansion. That ultimately
  put paid to the Cup Winners’ Cup. The Conference League was, by contrast,
  created with the Champions League’s overpopulation by the richest leagues
  thoroughly priced in. This year its league phase will include at least seven
  domestic champions from last season; a more extreme scenario, depending on
  results in a Europa League playoff round whose losing teams will be handed a
  Conference League safety net, would end with up to 15 participating. That is
  only one champion fewer than in the Champions League itself. Therein lies the
  real problem: the Conference League was formed in deference to a system that
  has allowed the wealthiest clubs, including the six from England who will play
  in the Champions League this season, to soar further away. If it solves the
  previous shortage of European games for clubs outside the elite, it cements
  the status quo and implicitly acknowledges that for most this will now be as
  good as things get. There is limited scope to barge into an increasingly
  embedded elite. Hope bubbles up in the form of clubs such as Pafos, who stand
  on the verge of a debut in the Champions League proper after winning their
  playoff first leg at Red Star Belgrade. Exposure to last season’s Conference
  League did not harm the Cypriot champions in preparing for the next step.
  Slovan Bratislava, veterans of two Conference Leagues before reaching last
  year’s Champions League, offer further evidence that some form of mobility
  remains possible. The ultimate cost to their domestic leagues of a guaranteed
  £15.7m for reaching Europe’s flagship competition remains unclear. This year’s
  Conference League may yet benefit from Palace’s relegation given Nottingham
  Forest, with whom they have swapped places, are plainly a stronger side.
  Perhaps Shakhtar Donetsk, Sparta Prague or Anderlecht can take advantage of
  the fact no one is likely to dominate to the extent Chelsea did. As Palace
  shape up for a second-choice shot at glory, their fortunes may tell plenty
  about the wider health of football’s ecosystem.
