  Every year, the Victorian parliament partakes of a tradition that has come to
  be known as “dump day” – when the government releases a flood of annual
  reports all at once, making it nearly impossible for journalists and other
  interested parties to properly scrutinise them. The opposition will, on cue,
  rail against the practice, ignoring the fact that dump day also existed when
  they were in power. But amendments put forward by the Greens, which passed
  Victorian parliament’s upper house on Tuesday, could finally bring an end to
  the practice. Here’s what we know. What happens on dump day? Picture this.
  You’re a journalist, political staffer or member of an advocacy group going
  about a busy sitting day in parliament when you receive a notification:
  “Documents have been tabled and can be accessed here.” You click the link and
  find hundreds of annual reports, some hundreds pages long. There’s rarely any
  notice they’re coming. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In 2022, the
  parliament’s website temporarily crashed after the government tabled 265
  reports just five days before Christmas, as attention was on the official
  opening of the 60th parliament after the state election. In 2023, there were
  more than 240 documents released at once, while last year there were 170, with
  more than 100 delayed to later sitting dates after several agencies failed to
  table them in time. Dump day is possible thanks to the Financial Management
  Act, a law which gives government entities until 31 October to table their
  annual reports. These reports are typically finalised around the end of the
  financial year but instead of being tabled as they’re ready, they’re often
  released in one, massive batch. The auditor general, Andrew Greaves, used his
  2023 annual report – tabled on dump day – to urge the government to rethink
  the schedule. “The time lag in tabling impedes accountability and transparency
  of entity performance because tabling a high volume of annual reports at the
  same time creates a significant information burden on parliamentarians and the
  Victorian community,” Greaves wrote at the time. The Greens leader, Ellen
  Sandell, says she knew dump day was a “running joke” in parliament but seeing
  it in action was no laughing matter. “When I first saw the piles of hundreds
  of annual reports released at once so no one could actually read what was in
  them, it was actually quite staggering,” Sandell says. “It’s terrible for
  democracy and transparency and being able to scrutinise the government
  properly, and that’s by design.” What is contained in the reports? All
  government departments and agencies must compile an annual report. This
  includes the state’s emergency services, hospitals, courts, environment
  agencies, cultural institutions, major transport projects, integrity bodies
  and even cemeteries. They’re not “just dry admin”, Sandell says, “they include
  things like police misconduct data, health service failures and public money
  blowouts.” Some reports make for particularly grim reading. The Commission for
  Children and Young People annual report details the number of allegations of
  child abuse and misconduct it receives, as well its investigations into
  children’s deaths. Others outline the state of public housing, animal deaths
  at the state’s zoos, length of the elective surgery waitlist, ambulance
  response times and how often they are ramped at hospitals. Catherine Williams
  from the Centre for Public Integrity says the reports contain a “wealth of
  information essential for both parliamentary and public scrutiny” of
  government performance. “But the dump day tradition undermines that scrutiny,”
  Williams says. “When hundreds of reports are released at once, it’s simply not
  possible to quickly get across what’s in them quickly and important issues can
  be missed entirely.” What are the Greens proposing? The government has put
  forward some amendments to the Financial Management Act in parliament, which
  are unrelated to dump day, but the Greens proposed some changes to the
  practice in exchange for their support to pass the bill. Their amendments
  force annual reports to be submitted between 15 and 31 October and then
  published within four sitting days of a minister receiving them or 14 days if
  parliament isn’t sitting. Ministers wouldn’t be able to dictate submission
  dates and would have to state when they received each report when it is
  tabled. The aim of the amendment is to have reports tabled more quickly and in
  smaller, more manageable batches. “It will significantly increase the
  likelihood that people can make use of the information when it’s provided. The
  way it’s done now really prevents that,” Williams says. So, will dump day
  actually be dumped? Yes, the government and opposition backed the amendments
  during debate in the upper house on Tuesday. The Coalition leader in the upper
  house, David Davis, said there should not be “significant lags” between annual
  reports being submitted and tabled. “As reports largely come through they
  should be tabled in a timely way – not dumped en masse,” he said. The
  treasurer and leader of the government in the upper house, Jaclyn Symes,
  thanked the Greens for working with the government. She said she was “very
  comfortable” with the amendment. “No one wants to sit on reports, you want to
  get them tabled,” she said. The bill now has to return to the lower house for
  another vote. Even if it passes, as is expected, some agencies are already
  missing the existing legislated deadline. It remains to be seen whether they
  will be able to meet an earlier one.
