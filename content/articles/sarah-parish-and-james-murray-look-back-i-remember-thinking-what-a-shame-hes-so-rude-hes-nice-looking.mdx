  Born in Somerset in 1968, Sarah Parish is an actor best known for her roles in
  W1A, Industry and Stay Close. She met fellow actor James Murray, 50, while
  working on the BBC drama Cutting It and they married in December 2007. In
  2014, the couple set up the Murray Parish Trust in memory of their first
  child, Ella-Jayne, who died at eight months of a congenital heart defect in
  2009. Relaunched as Imagine This, it is the only UK charity solely dedicated
  to supporting the mental wellbeing of ill children and their families; earlier
  this year the pair received MBEs in recognition of this work. Sarah and James
  live in Hampshire with their teenage daughter, Nell. Sarah This picture was
  taken in Abersoch, north Wales. It was a beautiful summer and the first time
  I’d been to the house Jim used to own with his brother and sister. Not only
  was it meaningful to visit an important place for Jim, but it was a fun, party
  holiday. I look very carefree. We had been together a year. Although this
  image is very idyllic, the first part of our relationship was quite dramatic.
  It was the early 00s and we were out a lot in Soho, having a great time
  mostly, but also being fairly tempestuous together. The thing you really love
  about somebody often becomes the thing you find threatening. While Jim and I
  were drawn to each other because we’re both out-there, sociable characters, we
  probably tried to tame each other a bit – which, funnily enough, didn’t work.
  The first time I met Jim was at a party. I didn’t like him much. I thought he
  was a very attractive man, but once we spoke I realised he had recently worked
  with my ex-boyfriend and had a preconception of me based on what he’d heard
  about the relationship. Jim said something inappropriate about the breakup and
  I remember thinking, what a shame he’s so rude, considering he’s so
  nice-looking. The next time we met was a month later at a read-through for
  Cutting It. He walked in and I thought, “Christ, it’s him.” This time, we
  became good friends. I didn’t realise that I liked him romantically until some
  of the cast went to play pool one afternoon. Jim took a shot, and had his back
  to me, and I said to my friend, “Something’s happened. I really fancy him.” I
  guess it was love at first back. Just over a year after this photo was taken,
  we were married and I was pregnant. Jim and I lost our first daughter,
  Ella-Jayne, to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. It was an incredibly distressing,
  life-changing time for us. My memories of that whole period are blurry. Even
  though she only lived for eight months, Ella-Jayne made a huge impression on
  so many people. Her memorial was a beautiful experience and we both read
  eulogies. It wasn’t easy on our relationship; Jim and I found it difficult to
  look after each other. Grief is all-consuming and we realised we had to do
  something. We found this amazing initiative called Hands Up Holidays, and went
  to Vietnam and Cambodia to work in various orphanages. On our return, we felt
  an enormous amount of strength, having been with children who had experienced
  unimaginable trauma but still had smiles on their faces. If they could carry
  on, so could we. The death of a child is difficult to get through as a couple,
  and maybe without setting up our charity we wouldn’t have made it. Now,
  Imagine This takes up most of our time, while acting feels like a holiday. We
  still have friends over to socialise every weekend, but we’re not nearly as
  wild as we were 20 years ago. Our relationship has settled into something much
  more peaceful. We’ve watched each other grow up, and now what I find most
  attractive about him isn’t nearly as superficial as the view of his back –
  it’s the way he throws himself into his passions. James The weather in north
  Wales means that you can very rarely spend a day diving off a boat into the
  sea, so that holiday was very special. The boat was laden with booze and more
  booze. It felt like anything was possible. At that point in time, our
  relationship was quite rock’n’roll. We were both successful actors and thought
  the world was our oyster. We travelled a lot, we partied a lot. We were both
  strong personalities who kept testing each other’s boundaries, only to be
  frustrated when we realised we couldn’t change one another. When I realised
  Sarah was going to be in Cutting It, I thought, “Oh God. Last time I saw her,
  it wasn’t great, so I’m just going to keep my head down.” On the day of the
  first read-through, I was a bit late, and the one spare seat was next to her.
  I assumed she would ignore me, but she was sweet, polite and behaved like any
  good lead actress would, welcoming and kind to the new person. It was that
  very quality that made me fall in love with her. Not only was she a brilliant
  actor, but how she behaved on set with people – cast, crew, whoever – was
  deeply impressive. Often the life of an actor is very transient, but Sarah and
  I stayed in touch after the show and became good friends. I don’t remember our
  first kiss, but it’s very likely I made the first move. When Ella-Jayne died,
  it was insurmountable. A lot of people didn’t know what to do or to say to us.
  That dynamic can get very exhausting because you feel like you have to
  apologise and help them get over their awkwardness. In the end, we ran away.
  For us to go to those orphanages and immerse ourselves in these stories of
  hope and reconciliation, that really put life in perspective. We came back in
  a much stronger frame of mind. Everyone grieves in different ways. For Sarah
  and me, there were moments of extreme volatility and disagreement that led to
  us questioning our future together. The loss of a child is such a seemingly
  impossible thing to digest unless the other person is feeling exactly the same
  emotion as you at exactly the same time. It’s very difficult to find a
  connection. When one is feeling down, the other has to feel strong enough to
  look after them, and vice versa. It’s hard to get the scales right and that
  can cause friction. We set up the trust five years after Ella-Jayne died.
  There is no finite amount of time you can spend working on a charity – it’s
  not a nine to five job. You could dedicate 24 hours a day to it and there’d
  still be more to do. But from my perspective, as soon as we harnessed the
  grief and focused, it became easier for us both. After spending a long time
  with someone, you often don’t notice them changing, day to day. But when I
  step back and think of Sarah’s evolution, it’s amazing. I want to say it’s
  like watching a flower bloom, but that’s too cliched. Instead, Sarah is a
  whole garden. Maybe I helped plant a few seeds or sketched out the landscape
  in the beginning, but 20 years later she has grown into this beautiful,
  thriving ecosystem that nurtures everyone around her.
