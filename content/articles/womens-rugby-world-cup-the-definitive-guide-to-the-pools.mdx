  Pool A England are red-hot favourites to top their pool and to lift the
  silverware as hosts thanks to their unstoppable form. They have not lost since
  the 2022 World Cup final and in April added a seventh consecutive Six Nations
  title to their trophy cabinet, scoring 256 points in their five matches on the
  way to the title. They were, however, in equally ruthless form before the last
  two World Cups only to be beaten by New Zealand in both finals. Whether they
  can get over the final hurdle remains to be seen but there can be little doubt
  about the victories they will achieve during the pool stage. The Red Roses,
  ranked No 1 in the world by a wide margin, have not lost a World Cup pool
  match in the history of the women’s tournament which began in 1991. A 13-13
  draw against Canada in 2014 is the only blemish on an otherwise perfect
  record, and that year they went on to lift the trophy. Australia, the United
  States and Samoa will all try to inflict an unlikely first defeat on England
  at this stage of the competition but, barring a huge upset, those three
  nations will be fighting for the remaining qualification spot alongside the
  hosts. Based on rankings most would expect Australia to join the Red Roses.
  The Wallaroos have reached only one World Cup semi-final previously – in 2010
  – but moved up to No 6 in the world rankings at the start of August. The US,
  meanwhile, have boosted their squad with former sevens talent, in their case
  the world’s most-followed rugby player on social media. Ilona Maher switched
  to the 15s game with a move to Bristol Bears in January and the centre has
  earned a spot in the squad. Crowds will be big at the US games with spectators
  clambering to get a glimpse of Maher – the Eagles’ warm-up game against Canada
  in Ottawa brought in a crowd of 11,453, a record for a standalone women’s game
  in North America. Others to look out for include Maher’s centre colleague Alev
  Kelter – often a game-changer for her team – and captain Kate Zackary, the
  back-row who brings playing prowess and leadership qualities. Australia and
  the US have their own rivalry from competing in the Pacific Four Series. In
  May, Australia ran out 27-19 winners and US will want to avenge that defeat at
  the World Cup, with the showdown in York on 30 August likely to decide who
  goes through to the last eight. Samoa will need more than one upset to
  progress as the lowest-ranked team in the pool. They have never reached the
  knockout stage and that again feels out of reach, but if they are able to land
  a blow on any of their opponents, it will represent a huge victory. England
  World ranking (as of 4 Aug) 1 Coach John Mitchell Captain Zoe Aldcroft Key
  player: Zoe Aldcroft Competition within the Red Roses squad increases every
  year with world-class stars from 1-23, but the captain was the only player to
  retain her starting shirt throughout this year’s Six Nations. She was already
  a stalwart for England before being given the captaincy but the role has only
  added to her presence on the pitch. Watch out for Aldcroft at the breakdown
  but also in open play; her individual try against Scotland in the Six Nations
  exemplified how clinical she can be with ball in hand. Australia World ranking
  6 Coach Jo Yapp Captain Siokapesi Palu Key player: Tabua Tuinakauvadra The No8
  has grown into the role since making her debut in 2023. This will be her first
  Rugby World Cup but her impact on pitch is regularly felt for the Wallaroos.
  She scored two tries in Australia’s second game against Wales in early August.
  She is a star that can do both, all of the hard work in the background that
  goes unnoticed but can also produce performances that grabs headlines. USA
  World ranking 10 Coach Sione Fukofuka Captain Kate Zackary Key player: Alev
  Kelter Kelter had a top-level college career in ice hockey and football
  (soccer) – playing internationally in both at youth level – before switching
  to rugby as her ambitions to make the US team for the Sochi Olympics dwindled.
  A sculpture and glassblowing graduate, she became the first American woman to
  score a sevens try at the Olympics and has made a name for herself in English
  domestic rugby with Loughborough Lightning. The centre has showcased her
  ability to spot space and break the line on the club and international stage.
  Sent off in a Pacific Four match against Australia in May for stamping. Samoa
  World ranking 15 Coach Mataafa Ramsey Tomokino Captain Sua Pauaraisa Key
  player: Sua Pauaraisa All 32 players in the squad are set to make their World
  Cup debuts but they are captained by an experienced leader in
  Masuisuimatamaalii (aka Sua) Tauaua Pauaraisa. She has also played sevens and
  rugby league and is excited to take her country into their first World Cup
  since 2014, saying: “I am thrilled to lead this team of passionate women and
  we will do our best to represent our beloved Samoa.” Fixtures England v USA

  Sep, 5pm, Brighton Pool B Canada are the tournament’s dark horses, flying
  under the radar despite their impressive form, and are more than capable of
  winning the World Cup for the first time. The England wing Jess Breach, who
  has never lost an international match, said the Red Roses’ WXV encounter with
  Canada last October was the first time she worried she was about to lose,
  though England eventually battled to a 21-12 victory. Canada were also
  impressive in the Pacific Four Series, beating the US and Australia, and
  drawing 27-27 with the Black Ferns. A 42-10 win over the US in their final
  warm-up game before heading to Europe suggests they are a side in fine form
  and they are finally beginning to get the financial backing their talent
  deserves: a Rugby Canada fundraising campaign – named “Mission: Win Rugby
  World Cup 2025” – aimed at closing the budget gap between them and their
  rivals, is closing in on its C$1m (£545,000 ) target. They should top the pool
  with the second knockout spot likely to go to Scotland or Wales. Wales took a
  second consecutive wooden spoon in the Six Nations but showed what they are
  capable of with a 21-12 win against Australia in Brisbane in the buildup, even
  if that was followed by a 36-5 defeat in Sydney. They are recovering from
  off-field controversy that almost resulted in the union withdrawing the team
  from the tournament. The threat came from the WRU over contract negotiations
  but that issue appears to have been resolved. Sean Lynn has taken charge after
  winning the English domestic league – the PWR – for three seasons in a row
  with Gloucester-Hartpury. They begin against familiar opposition in Scotland.
  The two sides met at the last World Cup, when a last-minute Keira Bevan
  penalty gave Wales victory and put them on course for the quarter-finals. This
  time Scotland will be favourites but games between them continue to be close.
  Most recently, in the Six Nations, Scotland came out 24-21 winners in a game
  that could have gone either way. Scotland’s head coach, Bryan Easson, will
  depart following the tournament after five years in charge. The reasons for
  his exit are unclear, but he has called the job “the greatest honour of my
  coaching career”. Meanwhile the captain, Rachel Malcolm, in July highlighted
  the “very disruptive” buildup to the tournament, with players facing
  uncertainty over their contracts after the summer. Fiji sensationally beat
  South Africa at the last World Cup but their recent form has been
  disappointing. They registered only one win at WXV3 – against Hong Kong China
  – while losing to Spain and Samoa. Their best chance of getting a result will
  be against Wales, but they will find it difficult not to finish bottom. Canada
  World ranking 2 Coach Kévin Rouet Captain Alex Tessier Key player: Sophie de
  Goede A long-time servant and highly capable leader, De Goede is one of the
  best players in the world. The 26-year-old – who keeps her match ticket from
  the final in 2014, when Canada lost to England, in her dressing table –
  possesses quick decision making and plenty of pace, making her a vital cog in
  the Canadian machine. She has recently recovered from a serious knee injury,
  so may not be in peak condition early on, but remains vital to the team.
  Scotland World ranking 8 Coach Bryan Easson Captain Rachel Malcolm Key player:
  Francesca McGhie The wing is one of the fastest players at the tournament – if
  any of Scotland’s opponents give her an inch she will take a mile. The
  22-year-old, who has recently signed for Trailfinders from Leicester Tigers,
  made her mark during the Women’s Six Nations and will aim to do the same at
  her first Rugby World Cup. Wales World ranking 9 Coach Sean Lynn Co-captains
  Alex Callender, Kate Williams Key player: Jasmine Joyce-Butchers The Bristol
  Bears wing is a three-time Olympian with Great Britain who has also competed
  at the Commonwealth Games and two previous World Cups, making her one of the
  most experienced players at the tournament. She is versatile, being able to
  play as a full-back or wing, and has electric pace though she is also
  committed in defence. Her wife Alisha is also a Wales international but is
  missing the tournament as she is pregnant with the couple’s first child. Fiji
  World ranking 14 Coach Ioan Cunningham Captain Alfreda Fisher Key player:
  Alfreda Fisher The 20-year-old became Fiji’s youngest women’s captain in May
  against Australia. Fisher, who grew up in the village of Togo on the tiny
  islet of Qamea, made her debut for the 15s side at WXV 3 in 2024 but has
  quickly become one of the first names on the teamsheet. Fiji’s head coach,
  Ioan Cunningham, said of the star: “She’s been a standout individual, leading
  by example.” Fixtures Scotland v Wales Sat 23 Aug, 2.45pm, Salford Canada v
  Fiji Sat 23 Aug, 5.30pm, York Canada v Wales Sat 30 Aug, noon, Salford
  Scotland v Fiji Sat 30 Aug, 2.45pm, Salford Canada v Scotland Sat 6 Sep, noon,
  Exeter Wales v Fiji Sat 6 Sep, 2.45pm, Exeter Pool C The defending champions
  New Zealand, six-time World Cup winners, are among the favourites to lift the
  trophy at Twickenham and should find their pool straightforward. Their options
  in the back three are so good that Ruby Tui – breakout star of their success
  last time around – did not make the squad. Among the wings is the speedy
  Ayesha Leti-I’iga who scored two tries in the 2022 final against England.
  Anything other than smooth progress to the latter stages would be a surprise.
  Those looking for signs of a shock could point to their 27-27 draw with Canada
  in May’s Pacific Four Series and the fact that Ireland are known for being a
  thorn in the Black Ferns’ side. They were the only team to beat them during
  the 2014 Rugby World Cup with a 17-14 pool stage win – the New Zealanders’
  first (and only) defeat at the tournament since 1991 – and more recently, at
  WXV last October, Ireland edged a 29-27 victory that shocked the sport, Erin
  King’s 79th-minute try and Dannah O’Brien’s conversion clinching a stunning
  result. New Zealand, though, have a habit of peaking at World Cups and while
  Ireland’s form has improved in the past year, they have lost King and flanker
  Dorothy Wall with long-term injuries. They are also likely be without their
  star player, Aoife Wafer, for the start of the tournament. The back-row had
  knee surgery in July and is in a race to be fit with coaches not expecting her
  to feature until their final pool game against the Black Ferns. The positive
  news for Scott Bemand’s side is Sam Monaghan’s recovery from an ACL injury.
  The Six Nations was a mixed bag, with comfortable wins over Italy and Wales,
  predictable defeats by England and France and a surprise loss to Scotland.
  Still, bonus points meant Ireland finished third behind Europe’s two
  heavyweights. Spain, who were on the receiving end of a 97-7 hammering by
  England in a warm-up game at the start of August, are competing in their first
  Rugby World Cup in eight years and Japan compete as amateurs so neither are
  expected to reach the knockouts. Instead the two countries will target each
  other as their opportunity to record a win. While Japan look the more
  experienced side, Spain are capable of pushing their opponents and could
  spring a surprise to rival their last World Cup, in 2017, when they beat Italy
  22-8 in the pool stage. Spain are not usually professional but the players
  have been handed six-month contracts to prepare for the tournament. Those
  contracts are due to run out in September but the union has said it wants to
  develop full-time deals for players. This World Cup could be the turning point
  for many unions in terms of a lasting impact. New Zealand World ranking 3
  Director of Performance Allan Bunting Co-captains Ruahei Demant and Kennedy
  Tukuafu Key player: Portia Woodman-Wickliffe Rivals may have let out a sigh of
  relief when the wing announced her retirement in 2024, but in April 2025 she
  was back. The 34-year-old will aim to add to her record Rugby World Cup try
  tally, which already stands at 20, five more than Bryan Habana who leads the
  way in the men’s tournament. Ireland World ranking 5 Coach Scott Bemand
  Captain Amee-Leigh Costigan Key player: Amee-Leigh Costigan She captained
  Ireland for the first time against France in the 2025 Six Nations and scored
  against the Red Roses during that tournament, the try displaying the pace and
  skill she has to outfox defences. The 30-year-old, who competed in the 100m
  and long jump in her junior years, brings huge experience from the sevens game
  and competed at the 2024 Paris Games. This is her first Rugby World Cup after
  Ireland failed to qualify in 2022. Japan World ranking 11 Coach Lesley
  McKenzie Captain Iroha Nagata Key player: Iroha Nagata Not only does the
  back-rower bring natural athleticism from sevens, where she has won a gold
  medal at the Asian Games, she also has an abundance of 15s game time. The
  26-year-old has already represented Japan at two World Cups. Along with
  playing experience, she also has a leadership string to her bow, having
  captained the side at the 2024 WXV 2 and on a recent tour to the US. Spain
  World ranking 13 Coach Juan González Marruecos Captain Laura Delgado Dueña Key
  player: Cristina Blanco Herrera The hooker recovered from injury in time to
  join Spain’s preparations for the World Cup, which was a huge boost. Blanco
  Herrera, who plays for Trailfinders in the PWR – a role she combines with
  working as a physiotherapist at Brunel University – has skill at the set piece
  but is also able to galvanise her side in crucial moments. Like the majority
  of the squad, she is playing in the World Cup for the first time. Fixtures

  Sun 31 Aug, 2pm, Exeter Japan v Spain Sun 7 Sep, noon, York New Zealand v
  Ireland Sun 7 Sep, 2.45pm, Brighton Pool D France and Italy are in prime
  position to reach the quarter-finals. The French objective will be to win the
  pool and avoid New Zealand in the last eight: presuming the Black Ferns top
  their group they will play the runners-up here. France will also be keen to
  produce statement performances to suggest their bid to win the tournament for
  the first time has a chance of coming to fruition. For such a consistent team
  with world-class players, France have generally failed to reach the expected
  heights. In 2022, they had a penalty in the final minutes of their World Cup
  semi-final to beat the hosts New Zealand and set up a final against rivals
  England, but Caroline Drouin missed the kick and the Black Ferns went through
  with a 25-24 victory. France at least responded to that disappointment by
  thumping Canada 36-0 in the third-place playoff. Les Bleues will be missing
  the suspended Pauline Bourdon Sansus for the opener against Italy, after the
  scrum-half was banned for criticising refereeing standards in France after a
  defeat for her club side, Toulouse. If any team can upset France in the pool
  it is Italy. Le Azzurre were quarter-finalists at the last World Cup (before
  losing to France) and had their moments in this year’s Six Nations despite
  lacking consistency. They beat Scotland in Edinburgh and Wales at home, and
  were impressive against Les Bleues in a 34-21 loss in Parma on their way to a
  fourth-place finish. It was Fabio Roselli’s first tournament in charge of the
  side and the head coach will be hoping the team can take another step forward.
  Roselli has World Cup experience, having played for Italy in the men’s
  tournament in 1999. The underdogs are tournament debutants Brazil, the first
  South American side to appear at the tournament. Solidity will be the
  objective for a side who have never before faced any of their pool opponents.
  They have been consistently playing only since 2019 and getting this far in
  such a short space of time is impressive. “Brazil’s participation in this
  World Cup is a historic milestone,” said Andre Chiofetti, the CEO of Brazil
  Rugby. Any kind of result for Brazil would be memorable and their best chance
  of a win will come against South Africa. The Springboks, however, will be
  favourites for that match-up and will be targeting the Brazil game themselves
  as they have not registered a win at a Rugby World Cup since 2010, when they
  defeated Wales 15-10. South Africa are regulars at the tournament, having
  featured in four editions – 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2021 – but have thus far been
  unable to match the success of the four-time world champion men’s side, and
  are yet to qualify from the group stage. France World ranking 4 Coaches Gaëlle
  Mignot and David Ortiz Co-captains Manaé Feleu and Marine Ménager Key player:
  Gabrielle Vernier The centre does a lot of work in the background but makes
  her presence known with strong hits and spectacular covering tackles. Vernier,
  who started playing in a boys’ team aged 10, has been one of the most
  consistent performers for France over the last few years, and was named the
  player of the 2023 Six Nations. A key axis in France’s game. Italy World
  ranking 6 Coach Fabio Roselli Captain Elisa Giordano Key player: Beatrice
  Rigoni A selection that may raise a few eyebrows given the Sale Sharks centre
  has been out of favour since the Six Nations. But no one can question the
  experience she brings, and during the crucial moments, that is what you need
  in tournament rugby. Rigoni, who studied to be a pharmacist at university, is
  also capable of producing moments of individual brilliance to carve open
  opposition defences. Even starting from the bench, the 29-year-old can turn a
  game on its head. South Africa World ranking 12 Coach Swys de Bruin
  Co-captains Nolusindiso Booi and Babalwa Latsha Key player: Babalwa Latsha Not
  only has Latsha been crucial for South Africa on the field, the 31-year-old
  prop has also been a substantial player in moving African women’s rugby
  forward. She was the first female African player to become professional in
  2020 and continues to drive standards. She is also experienced in the sevens
  game, bringing pace and skill from that code, having also honed her skills
  with a stay at Harlequins. Brazil World ranking 25 Coach Emiliano Caffera
  Captain Eshyllen Coimbra Key player: Edna Santini The sevens and rugby league
  star Santini is poised to make history individually as well as being a part of
  a groundbreaking Brazil team. The 33-year-old is poised to become the first
  player to compete at a Rugby World Cup, Rugby World Cup Sevens, Sevens World
  Series, Olympic games and Rugby League World Cup. Santini’s skilful footwork
  has already helped Brazil at several tournaments and this will be no
  different. Fixtures France v Italy Sat 23 Aug, 8.15pm, Exeter South Africa v

Their options in the back three are so good that Ruby Tui – breakout star of their success last time around – did not make the squad. Among the wings is the speedy Ayesha Leti-I’iga who scored two tries in the 2022 final against England. Anything other than smooth progress to the latter stages would be a surprise. Those looking for signs of a shock could point to their 27-27 draw with Canada in May’s Pacific Four Series and the fact that Ireland are known for being a thorn in the Black Ferns’ side. They were the only team to beat them during the 2014 Rugby World Cup with a 17-14 pool stage win – the New Zealanders’ first (and only) defeat at the tournament since 1991 – and more recently, at WXV last October, Ireland edged a 29-27 victory that shocked the sport, Erin King’s 79th-minute try and Dannah O’Brien’s conversion clinching a stunning result. New Zealand, though, have a habit of peaking at World Cups and while Ireland’s form has improved in the past year, they have lost King and flanker Dorothy Wall with long-term injuries. They are also likely be without their star player, Aoife Wafer, for the start of the tournament. The back-row had knee surgery in July and is in a race to be fit with coaches not expecting her to feature until their final pool game against the Black Ferns. The positive news for Scott Bemand’s side is Sam Monaghan’s recovery from an ACL injury. The Six Nations was a mixed bag, with comfortable wins over Italy and Wales, predictable defeats by England and France and a surprise loss to Scotland. Still, bonus points meant Ireland finished third behind Europe’s two heavyweights. Spain, who were on the receiving end of a 97-7 hammering by England in a warm-up game at the start of August, are competing in their first Rugby World Cup in eight years and Japan compete as amateurs so neither are expected to reach the knockouts. Instead the two countries will target each other as their opportunity to record a win. While Japan look the more experienced side, Spain are capable of pushing their opponents and could spring a surprise to rival their last World Cup, in 2017, when they beat Italy 22-8 in the pool stage. Spain are not usually professional but the players have been handed six-month contracts to prepare for the tournament. Those contracts are due to run out in September but the union has said it wants to develop full-time deals for players. This World Cup could be the turning point for many unions in terms of a lasting impact. New Zealand World ranking 3 Director of Performance Allan Bunting Co-captains Ruahei Demant and Kennedy Tukuafu Key player: Portia Woodman-Wickliffe Rivals may have let out a sigh of relief when the wing announced her retirement in 2024, but in April 2025 she was back. The 34-year-old will aim to add to her record Rugby World Cup try tally, which already stands at 20, five more than Bryan Habana who leads the way in the men’s tournament. Ireland World ranking 5 Coach Scott Bemand Captain Amee-Leigh Costigan Key player: Amee-Leigh Costigan She captained Ireland for the first time against France in the 2025 Six Nations and scored against the Red Roses during that tournament, the try displaying the pace and skill she has to outfox defences. The 30-year-old, who competed in the 100m and long jump in her junior years, brings huge experience from the sevens game and competed at the 2024 Paris Games. This is her first Rugby World Cup after Ireland failed to qualify in 2022. Japan World ranking 11 Coach Lesley McKenzie Captain Iroha Nagata Key player: Iroha Nagata Not only does the back-rower bring natural athleticism from sevens, where she has won a gold medal at the Asian Games, she also has an abundance of 15s game time. The 26-year-old has already represented Japan at two World Cups. Along with playing experience, she also has a leadership string to her bow, having captained the side at the 2024 WXV 2 and on a recent tour to the US. Spain World ranking 13 Coach Juan González Marruecos Captain Laura Delgado Dueña Key player: Cristina Blanco Herrera The hooker recovered from injury in time to join Spain’s preparations for the World Cup, which was a huge boost. Blanco Herrera, who plays for Trailfinders in the PWR – a role she combines with working as a physiotherapist at Brunel University – has skill at the set piece but is also able to galvanise her side in crucial moments. Like the majority of the squad, she is playing in the World Cup for the first time.

The French objective will be to win the pool and avoid New Zealand in the last eight: presuming the Black Ferns top their group they will play the runners-up here. France will also be keen to produce statement performances to suggest their bid to win the tournament for the first time has a chance of coming to fruition. For such a consistent team with world-class players, France have generally failed to reach the expected heights. In 2022, they had a penalty in the final minutes of their World Cup semi-final to beat the hosts New Zealand and set up a final against rivals England, but Caroline Drouin missed the kick and the Black Ferns went through with a 25-24 victory. France at least responded to that disappointment by thumping Canada 36-0 in the third-place playoff. Les Bleues will be missing the suspended Pauline Bourdon Sansus for the opener against Italy, after the scrum-half was banned for criticising refereeing standards in France after a defeat for her club side, Toulouse. If any team can upset France in the pool it is Italy. Le Azzurre were quarter-finalists at the last World Cup (before losing to France) and had their moments in this year’s Six Nations despite lacking consistency. They beat Scotland in Edinburgh and Wales at home, and were impressive against Les Bleues in a 34-21 loss in Parma on their way to a fourth-place finish. It was Fabio Roselli’s first tournament in charge of the side and the head coach will be hoping the team can take another step forward. Roselli has World Cup experience, having played for Italy in the men’s tournament in 1999. The underdogs are tournament debutants Brazil, the first South American side to appear at the tournament. Solidity will be the objective for a side who have never before faced any of their pool opponents. They have been consistently playing only since 2019 and getting this far in such a short space of time is impressive. “Brazil’s participation in this World Cup is a historic milestone,” said Andre Chiofetti, the CEO of Brazil Rugby. Any kind of result for Brazil would be memorable and their best chance of a win will come against South Africa. The Springboks, however, will be favourites for that match-up and will be targeting the Brazil game themselves as they have not registered a win at a Rugby World Cup since 2010, when they defeated Wales 15-10. South Africa are regulars at the tournament, having featured in four editions – 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2021 – but have thus far been unable to match the success of the four-time world champion men’s side, and are yet to qualify from the group stage. France World ranking 4 Coaches Gaëlle Mignot and David Ortiz Co-captains Manaé Feleu and Marine Ménager Key player: Gabrielle Vernier The centre does a lot of work in the background but makes her presence known with strong hits and spectacular covering tackles. Vernier, who started playing in a boys’ team aged 10, has been one of the most consistent performers for France over the last few years, and was named the player of the 2023 Six Nations. A key axis in France’s game. Italy World ranking 6 Coach Fabio Roselli Captain Elisa Giordano Key player: Beatrice Rigoni A selection that may raise a few eyebrows given the Sale Sharks centre has been out of favour since the Six Nations. But no one can question the experience she brings, and during the crucial moments, that is what you need in tournament rugby. Rigoni, who studied to be a pharmacist at university, is also capable of producing moments of individual brilliance to carve open opposition defences. Even starting from the bench, the 29-year-old can turn a game on its head. South Africa World ranking 12 Coach Swys de Bruin Co-captains Nolusindiso Booi and Babalwa Latsha Key player: Babalwa Latsha Not only has Latsha been crucial for South Africa on the field, the 31-year-old prop has also been a substantial player in moving African women’s rugby forward. She was the first female African player to become professional in 2020 and continues to drive standards. She is also experienced in the sevens game, bringing pace and skill from that code, having also honed her skills with a stay at Harlequins. Brazil World ranking 25 Coach Emiliano Caffera Captain Eshyllen Coimbra Key player: Edna Santini The sevens and rugby league star Santini is poised to make history individually as well as being a part of a groundbreaking Brazil team. The 33-year-old is poised to become the first player to compete at a Rugby World Cup, Rugby World Cup Sevens, Sevens World Series, Olympic games and Rugby League World Cup. Santini’s skilful footwork has already helped Brazil at several tournaments and this will be no different.
