  clean car transition?

  Every time a driver puts 10 litres of fuel in their car, they’re paying about
  $5 in tax that goes to the federal government. That is, of course, unless they
  drive an electric vehicle. No petrol or diesel being bought means the
  government loses that 51c per litre. Over recent years, the Productivity
  Commission has been calling for reforms on how revenue is raised from
  vehicles, and the Albanese government has been making noises that a road user
  charge could be put on EVs. After the government’s economic reform roundtable
  this week, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there was “a lot of conceptual
  support for road user charging” but said the details – including the type of
  charge and what vehicles would be included – were still to be determined..
  State treasurers will discuss the concept when they meet next month. According
  to the Electric Vehicle Council, about 298,000 battery electric vehicles and
  81,000 plug-in hybrids have been sold in Australia so far. While that number
  is going up – EV sales were 13% of new car sales in the last quarter, the
  highest proportion on record – they still make up less than 2% of the 21.7m
  vehicles on the road. “We’re still in the early adopter phase on EVs and well
  behind the adoption rates of other advanced economies,” says Prof Matt Burke,
  a transport expert at Griffith University and an EV owner. He says there is
  “widespread agreement” and a “coalition of the willing” among policy experts
  and automobile clubs that a road user charge is coming. But what it looks like
  is still up for debate. And some are worried that bringing a charge in too
  early could stymie the uptake of EVs. Burke says governments could decide on a
  flat fee for EV users, or a fee related to how far vehicles drive that could
  also include an allowance for the weight of the vehicle. “Electric vehicles
  don’t pollute in the same way as other vehicles, but they are a little bit
  heavier and that deteriorates the road surface a bit more,” he says. Where the
  excise goes But what is the fuel excise actually used for? “People think that
  fuel excise pays for roads, but it doesn’t,” says Alison Reeve, director of
  the energy and climate program at the Grattan Institute. According to the
  Parliamentary Budget Office, less than 6% of the fuel excise the government
  collects goes into a special account for states and territories to spend on
  road infrastructure. Fuel excise is not what is known as a “hypothecated tax”
  – that is, a tax where the spending of the revenue is directed at a particular
  issue, like roads. “[Fuel excise] hasn’t been hypothecated since 1992. But
  people still think it’s how it works,” says Reeve. “Some of that revenue might
  go to roads and some of it might go for new carpets in Parliament House.”
  Falling revenue The government’s revenue from fuel excise is definitely
  falling, but it’s not really because of EVs. From a peak in the 1980s, the
  amount of fuel excise as a percentage of government revenue has fallen from
  about 11% to 4%, thanks largely to improved fuel efficiency. The average
  passenger vehicle in Australia burned 11.3 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres
  in 2005. Now it burns only 6.9 litres, and with new efficiency standards in
  place for new vehicles, that number is likely to drop further. A future
  dominated by electric cars would see a dramatic drop in the fuel excise. Right
  now, the government is left with about $15bn from the tax after it has given
  full rebates to fuel that was burned off roads – mostly on mining sites – and
  partial rebates for heavy vehicles. There would be good arguments that the
  amount of tax collected for driving a vehicle should reflect its cost to
  society, such as the health impacts of cars that run on fossil fuels and the
  thousands of premature deaths each year caused by breathing in particulates.
  There’s also the accumulating damage to the climate from the release of
  greenhouse gases. But Reeve says the amount of excise charged by the
  government “is just a number that the government thinks it can get away with”.
  Right policy, wrong time? The Electric Vehicle Council’s head of legal, policy
  and advocacy, Aman Gaur, says a road user charge “is going to be a reality”
  but it needs to be paid by all vehicles, not just EVs. The council represents
  car companies making and selling electric cars and says EV drivers should be
  exempt from a charge until 30% of new vehicle sales are electric. “Just
  hitting EV drivers will be counterproductive,” says Gaur. “We support a charge
  for all types of vehicles. We don’t want to see a model that slams the breaks
  on our transition to a cleaner transport economy.” The New South Wales
  government has proposed its own road user charge which, if there is no federal
  scheme, could be introduced in mid-2027. The proposed fee would be 2.97 cents
  per kilometre for an EV and 2.37c for a plug-in hybrid. An EV driver doing
  10,000km would expect to pay $300 under that proposed scheme. New cars sold in
  Australia average 6.9 litres of fuel use per 100km. A driver of an average new
  petrol car doing the same distance pays about $352 in fuel excise. “Paying
  $300 might not be the end of the world for an EV enthusiast, but we need to
  think about the average person looking to buy an EV. For those people, that
  $300 might be the difference [of them buying the car],” Gaur says. But there
  are other advantages to a general road user charge, Burke points out. It can
  give a government the ability to give discounts for some people, such as
  pensioners or the unemployed, or incorporate congestion charging. A big
  question will be whether revenue from a road user charge would go into the
  government’s general coffers or if it would be ringfenced. The Australian
  Automobile Association has suggested revenue from road user charges on EVs
  should go into transport infrastructure, including building more recharging
  stations. Helen Rowe, the transport lead at the Climateworks Centre, says: “If
  designed well, [a road user charge] could do far more than just plug a revenue
  gap. “It could help cut congestion, reduce emissions, lower infrastructure
  costs and improve the overall efficiency of Australia’s transport network.”
