  An Israeli government official charged with soliciting a minor believed he was
  meeting a 15-year-old girl for “sexual contact”, according to police – and
  brought a condom to the planned rendezvous in Las Vegas. Tom Artiom
  Alexandrovich, a division head at the Israel National Cyber Directorate, was
  arrested in a police sting operation aimed at online users seeking to sexually
  prey on children. The Las Vegas outlet 8NewsNow reported that Alexandrovich
  chatted with an officer posing as a teenager online before being arrested.
  “The sexual contact included bringing a condom and taking the decoy to ‘Cirque
  du Soleil’,” which stages elaborate shows along the Las Vegas Strip, said
  police documents seen by 8NewsNow. Details of the arrest came as the state
  department denied the US government played any role in releasing the Israeli
  official – after Alexanderovich was able to return to Israel once he had
  bonded out of jail in connection with the felony charge. A swarm of commentary
  online, propelled in part by Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene,
  speculated that Alexanderovich had been shielded by the government at a time
  when the Trump administration has been struggling to contain criticism over
  unfulfilled promises to release all files related to the prosecution of the
  late, disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “The
  Department of State is aware that Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, an Israeli
  citizen, was arrested in Las Vegas and given a court date for charges related
  to soliciting sex electronically from a minor,” the state department wrote on
  X. “He did not claim diplomatic immunity and was released by a state judge
  pending a court date. Any claims that the US government intervened are false.”
  That statement came after Greene, who has recently broken with the White House
  over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, questioned Alexandrovich’s case on
  Monday, claiming that the government had “release[d] a child sex predator from
  Israel who works directly under the prime minister of Israel”, Benjamin
  Netanyahu. Abramovich was arrested as he arrived at an agreed-upon location
  for the meet-up, 8NewsNow reported. He told police he believed he was chatting
  with an 18-year-old. “Alexandrovich stated he felt the girl ‘pushed’ him to
  talk about bringing a condom, yet could not remember how many times the girl
  ‘pushed’ him,” police documents seen by 8NewsNow said. “Alexandrovich stated
  he was embarrassed for being arrested.” Court records reviewed by Reuters show
  a $10,000 bond was posted in Alexandrovich’s case at the Henderson detention
  center, south-east of Las Vegas, on 7 August. The records indicate he is due
  back in court on 27 August. A post on Israel’s government website from
  November describes Alexandrovich as the “head of the Technological Defense
  Division at the INCD [Israel National Cyber Directorate]”. A screenshot on
  Alexanderovich’s LinkedIn page, first reported by Mediaite, describes him as
  the same. A post on Alexandrovich’s page alluded to his having been in Las
  Vegas earlier in August for the Black Hat Briefings, a yearly meeting of
  cybersecurity professionals. “Two things you can’t escape at Black Hat 2025:
  the relentless buzz of generative [artificial intelligence] and the sound of
  Hebrew … in every corridor,” Alexandrovich wrote in part in an accompanying
  post. Invoking an abbreviation for large language models and referring to one
  of Israel’s largest cities, the post continued: “The key takeaway? The future
  of cybersecurity is being written in code, and it seems a significant part of
  it is being authored in #TelAviv and powered by LLMs. An exciting time to be
  in the field!” That LinkedIn page under Alexandrovich’s name has since been
  deleted. Israeli media reported in recent days that Alexanderovich had been
  released and was back in Israel, with some quoting the Netanyahu’s office as
  denying that Alexandrovich was arrested, saying only that a “state employee”
  was “questioned by American authorities during his stay” and he had “returned
  to Israel as scheduled”. The Israeli news site Ynet reported that
  Alexandrovich was on leave from the Cyber Directorate by “mutual decision”.
  Alexanderovich was among eight men in an operation led by Nevada’s internet
  crime against children taskforce. All of the suspects believed they were
  meeting minors when undercover officers instead confronted and arrested them,
  police said. The arrested men were all brought to jail after being detained,
  said the statement from the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, which
  participated in the operation alongside local, state and federal law
  enforcement officials. Among the other suspects was Las Vegas Redemption
  church pastor Neal Harrison Creecy, 46, 8NewsNow reported. Creecy reportedly
  believed he would meet a 14-year-old boy when he was arrested, and he resigned
  after posting a $10,000 bond for his release from jail. Under Nevada law,
  luring a child with a computer for a sex act can carry between one to 10 years
  in prison. Ramon Antonio Vargas and Reuters contributed reporting
