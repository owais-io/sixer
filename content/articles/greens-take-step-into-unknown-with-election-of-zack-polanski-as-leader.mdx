  OK, now they’ve got your attention. In electing Zack Polanski, a
  media-friendly former actor with an eye-catching vision for a mass movement of
  “eco-populism”, the Greens have taken a step into the unknown. And the first
  task for Polanski is to bring the party with him. Green leadership contests
  are generally quite polite. This time it has been different, in part due to
  the personalities but mainly because of the very different visions on offer.
  The vanquished duo of Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns represented the nearest
  thing the Greens have to an establishment – two of the party’s four MPs,
  beneficiaries of a patient and gradual electoral push, promising more of the
  same. While Polanski is hardly an outsider, having been deputy leader since
  2022, his critique was pointed: progress was happening too slowly and the
  Greens risked being left behind, not least by a Reform party already much
  bigger in membership and poll numbers. This understandably ruffled some
  feathers, particularly coming a year after the party won four seats in
  Westminster, quadrupling its representation. The contest has been at times not
  hostile but certainly a bit grumpy, with Ramsay barely bothering to mask his
  disdain for Polanski and his approach. Some other senior Greens bristled at
  Polanki’s surprise leadership bid, first announced in a Guardian interview,
  with one terming it a “hostile takeover”. But others praised his energy and an
  apparent influx of enthused new members. While the role of Green leader in
  England and Wales has very limited power – the party didn’t even have one
  before 2008 – they are a figurehead and a media focus, a role that the fluent
  Polanski aims to use to the full. He must now balance an attention-grabbing
  style with the risk of alienating either the party’s other main power base,
  its MPs, or the chunk of members who remain sceptical about his talents and
  approach. One issue highlighted particularly by Ramsay and Chowns in the
  leadership campaign was what they saw as the risk that Polanski’s more openly
  leftwing stance could put off some voters, particularly the sort of loose
  electoral coalition that helped the defeated duo win parliamentary seats last
  year in rural, Conservative-facing seats. The Greens are unmistakably a
  radical, leftwing party, with their 2024 election manifesto last year
  promising wealth taxes, nationalised utilities and a ban on some short-haul
  flights. But much like the Liberal Democrats they have made gains by combining
  an energised base with a larger group of voters who broadly or even vaguely
  like them and what they stand for. If Polanski leans into an alliance with
  Jeremy Corbyn’s new party, as hinted at, this latter group could shrink. The
  rejoinder from Polanski’s allies is that the status quo is not sustainable,
  and a tactic of painstakingly building up councillors before going for a
  parliamentary seat is just too slow in an era when Nigel Farage could be the
  next prime minister. Additionally, for all that Ramsay is deeply respected in
  the party, he can be a cautious communicator and a slightly anonymous media
  presence. A YouGov poll last week found that just 9% of Green voters in the
  last election could identify him from a photo. Chowns is more natural
  performer but possibly even less well known. With the obvious caveat that
  leading the fifth-placed party in UK politics dims the spotlight, Polanski
  will be under pressure to show he has not just the patter but also the
  judgment, with some eyebrows raised by his call in May for the UK to consider
  leaving Nato, which was not in the manifesto. He will also face renewed
  scrutiny of his past, including a slightly curious 2013 incident in which the
  Sun ran an article that said Polanski, at the time a hypnotherapist, had
  promised to use the technique to try to enlarge a female client’s breasts. But
  Polanski’s biggest challenge, which would have been the case whoever had been
  elected, will be to adeptly negotiate a rapidly changing political landscape,
  one where the prospect of the Greens hauling in large numbers of left-leaning
  voters disappointed with Labour risks being scuppered by the new Corbyn
  venture. Events for the Greens are moving fast and they will hope they have a
  leader equal to the challenge. The one thing it won’t be is boring.
