  The Netherlands has said it will contribute €500m ($578m/£500m) to buy US
  military equipment for Ukraine, becoming the first Nato country to contribute
  to a new mechanism to supply Kyiv with American weapons. The Dutch defence
  minister, Ruben Brekelmans, said on X on Monday that the package would include
  Patriot parts and missiles. Nato’s chief, Mark Rutte, welcomed the
  announcement and said he had encouraged other alliance members to participate
  in the new mechanism, called the Nato prioritised Ukraine requirements list
  (Purl) initiative. “This is about getting Ukraine the equipment it urgently
  needs now to defend itself against Russian aggression,” Rutte – a former Dutch
  prime minister – said in a statement, adding that he expected “further
  significant announcements from other allies soon”. President Donald Trump said
  last month the US would provide weapons to Ukraine, paid for by European
  allies, without providing details on how this would work. The US ambassador to
  Nato said he expected many more countries to announce over the coming weeks
  that they would participate. “We’re moving as fast as possible,” Matthew
  Whitaker told Reuters on Monday. Asked about a timeline for getting US
  deliveries to Ukraine under the new mechanism, he said: “I think we’ll see it
  moving very quickly, certainly in the coming weeks, but some even sooner than
  that. The Dutch are just the first of many.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the
  Netherlands’ decision. “Ukraine, and thus the whole of Europe, will be better
  protected from Russian terror,” the Ukrainian president said on X. “I am
  sincerely grateful to the Netherlands for their substantial contribution to
  strengthening Ukraine’s air shield.” Russian strikes hit a railway station in
  eastern Ukraine, killing a mechanic and wounding four workers, the national
  rail company said on Tuesday. Several trains had been rerouted, Ukrainian
  Railways said after the attack in Lozova, Kharkiv province. Lozova’s mayor
  said two children were also wounded in the attack and residential quarters
  damaged. “Lozova has survived the most massive attack since the beginning of
  the war,” Sergiy Zelensky said on Facebook. Two people were also wounded in a
  separate Russian drone attack on Zaporizhzhia, the region’s military
  administration said. Donald Trump’s special envoy is expected in Moscow days
  before Donald Trump’s deadline on Friday for Russia to make progress on ending
  the Ukraine war or face increased US sanctions, reports Shaun Walker. The US
  president said Steve Witkoff would visit Moscow on Wednesday or Thursday. When
  asked what message Witkoff would take to Russia and what Vladimir Putin, the
  Russian president, could do to avoid new sanctions, Trump: “Get a deal where
  people stop getting killed.” Sources in Kyiv said they expected Keith Kellogg,
  Trump’s Ukraine envoy, to visit the country towards the end of the week,
  possibly to coincide with Witkoff’s visit to Moscow. Ukraine said on Monday it
  had charged six people, including a lawmaker and a government official, for
  embezzling funds in the purchase of drones and jamming equipment for the
  military. Anti-corruption authorities said on Saturday they had uncovered a
  scheme offering kickbacks for purchases at inflated prices and that it
  allegedly involved a legislator, one current and one now-sacked official, a
  National Guard commander and two businessmen. The National Anti-Corruption
  Bureau alleged the bribes totalled about 30% of the contracts’ value and that
  the drone contract was worth $240,000, with an inflation of about $80,000.
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had visited Ukrainian troops holding the line in
  the Kharkiv region bordering Russia and discussed how drones were used in
  fighting. “Our warriors in this sector are reporting the participation of
  mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and African countries
  in the war,” the Ukrainian president said on social media on Monday. “We will
  respond.” Donald Trump said on Monday he would substantially raise tariffs on
  goods from India over its Russian oil purchases. “India is not only buying
  massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased,
  selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people
  in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” Trump posted on his
  Truth Social platform. “Because of this, I will be substantially raising the
  Tariff paid by India to the USA.” Trump earlier announced a 25% tariff on
  Indian goods starting last Friday, while New Delhi said it would safeguard its
  interests and called its targeting “unjustified”. Russia’s Ryazan oil refinery
  has halted around half its refining capacity since 2 August after a Ukrainian
  drone attack last week, three industry sources told Reuters. Two primary oil
  refining units at the Rosneft-operated refinery – about 180km south-east of
  Moscow – were stopped after the attacks, they said.
