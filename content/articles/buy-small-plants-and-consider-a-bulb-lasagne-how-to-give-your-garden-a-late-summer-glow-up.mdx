  Clear and cut back “It is not always necessary to rip out everything and start
  again,” says Ella Malt, who runs the gardening company Soil and Soul Norfolk.
  “It is much more sustainable to work with what you have. You can make such a
  difference with a bit of cutting back, clearing up leaves, cutting an edge on
  a lawn. People notice edges: you could spend hours making a herbaceous border
  perfect but if the edge of that border isn’t crisp, it will automatically look
  untidy.” “Never underestimate how much a good tidy will help things,” agrees
  Glaswegian gardener Colin Stewart, who was at Great Dixter in East Sussex and
  now works with private clients. “Even just sweeping up dead leaves from paths
  makes a huge difference. Sharpen up fuzzy edges. Be brutal: if you’ve got
  plants that are going over, maybe sweet peas which have bolted and look a bit
  sad, rather than hanging on to them, it is probably best to be ruthless and
  pull those things out and put in something new – there is still a lot of time
  before the frosts are coming. Deadheading flowers will help to replenish
  plants so they can flower again.” Leave anything that could become a seedhead,
  like Digitalis lutea or verbascums, Stewart says. Think about boundaries
  Giving paving a good sweep and scrub can make an immediate impression. “Even
  sweeping up dead leaves from paths makes a huge difference,” says Stewart.
  “Neat paths always make any chaos feel instantly more intentional. If you have
  really cracked concrete or paving slabs, putting gravel down is a good idea.
  If you put a thick enough layer down, some plants will self sow into it. It is
  preferable to decking, which always rots and becomes a hideout for vermin.”
  And don’t forget to sort out any sad-looking fencing, which can be painted if
  not replaced: “I go into a lot of gardens that are really let down by
  boundaries,” says Stewart. “Painting all the fences and walls around the space
  in the same colour, in a uniform way, makes an astonishing difference and
  elevates the whole garden.” Look for the light Planting “depends on whether
  you’re in sun or shade”, says Malt. “If you’ve got a sunny garden that gets
  dry in summer, obviously Mediterranean plants will do well; things like
  Artemesia, Eryngium, myrtle and Phlomis. For dry shade, ferns give lovely
  texture.” “It is important to think about where the light falls, not just in
  terms of plants, but also where you want to sit,” says Stewart. “You probably
  want your seating area to be in the sunniest spot where the light falls in
  winter, spring and autumn. But in the summer, you probably want it to be in
  the shadiest part of the garden. And maybe that ends up being almost the same
  place, because of the way the position of the sun changes and because of the
  things coming into leaf. The classic advice is always to wait a year and
  observe your garden before you commit to doing anything major: look at where
  the light falls at every point in the year.” Know your soil “You can do a soil
  test,” says garden designer and presenter Danny Clarke, which you can get from
  a garden centre, to find out whether it is sandy, clay or loam. “If you’ve got
  soil that is a bit challenging – for example it’s deficient in nutrients, has
  poor drainage, or is clay, which makes it hard to work with in dry or wet
  conditions – you can always put in a raised bed. Then you control the medium
  and can put the plants you want in your space.” Clarke adds: “I believe in
  gardening on the edge: give it a go and see what happens. If you are unsure as
  to where to put a plant, put it in the ground, and it will soon tell you if it
  is unhappy. When the leaves are drooping, it is going to need watering or
  feeding. If that doesn’t work, you have probably put it in the wrong place, so
  move it and see what happens. That’s what being green-fingered is all about.”
  Embrace container gardening Whatever kind of outdoor space you have,
  containers are a good idea, says Malt. “You can moderate the environment for
  the plants, so you can grow almost anything in a container. Normal rules don’t
  apply. Some people will say, ‘You can only put bedding plants in, or you can
  only do roses or certain types of small shrub’ – I think that is rubbish. Go
  to a nursery, see what you like, and just try it.” Containers are particularly
  good for edibles: “I’ve got cucumbers growing in pots up a trellis,” says
  Malt. “Strawberries are great in containers,” says Clarke. “They are very
  drought-tolerant and children love them, as do the birds.” Malt is always
  relocating her pots: “If they don’t thrive in one part of the patio, balcony,
  or whatever you’ve got, you can just move it over. If you’ve got full sun, it
  is better to choose things that thrive in full sun. But if you’ve got a patio
  that faces lots of different aspects, you can move things around a bit.” Malt
  uses old sinks, olive oil tins and chimney pipes as homes for cardoons,
  Althaea cannabina and salvias. “They are all pretty drought-tolerant plants
  that can take not being watered as much. Having said that, if you are growing
  in pots, they will always need a fair amount of water. If you’ve got the
  option of capturing rain with a water butt, that is really helpful. The other
  thing with pots is to make sure you feed them regularly. Some people think you
  have to change the soil all the time, but you don’t, you just keep them fed.
  Make sure you get a really good liquid seaweed, and if you feed that every
  week or fortnight, they are going to be fine.” “Use trailing plants for your
  balcony pots to cover the container,” says Clarke. “Use a cheap container,
  fill it with soil, put in flowers for height, which could be poppies or roses,
  then some trailing rosemary. There is a saying: ‘Thriller, filler, spiller.’ A
  thriller such as a canna lily would be a centrepiece; you might say it’s a
  show-off. A filler such as a geranium acts in a supporting role and fills out
  the space. The spillers, such as ivy, are planted at the edge of the container
  and trail downwards.” Garden for a heating climate “Concentrate watering on
  new plantings and pots,” says Stewart. “I would never water a lawn. Let your
  grass go brown and it will revive when the rain comes. I’ve got gardens I work
  on where the lawn is almost like a short meadow and is allowed to flower and
  get to a certain height, and it stays greener. If you have a very
  close-cropped, immaculately cut lawn, that will go brown much sooner.” If you
  go on holiday and come back to a dead-looking garden, don’t panic, says
  Stewart: “Just give it a consistent water for a couple of weeks, and it will
  probably start to show signs of life.” Unpredictable summer weather can be
  difficult to plan for but “fennel is brilliant”, says Malt, “because it is
  really tolerant of dry spells and seems to be quite happy when it is wet.
  Cistus are having a real moment; they have a very long season of interest and
  don’t mind dry.” Buy small plants “Be patient and buy smaller plants,” says
  Malt. “Bare root is best, but 9cm plants are good. They will take a bit longer
  to get going but they catch up quickly, and they’re much hardier and better
  for the planet in terms of plastic waste, and much cheaper.” Water them
  thoroughly when you plant, says Malt, to make sure they are well established.
  Plant in clumps “It is so much better, if you’re going to buy 15 plants, to
  buy three varieties – five of three different plants – because things look
  great in big clumps,” says Malt. “I generally buy in fives. That’s my number.”
  “Always plant in odd numbers because it doesn’t look contrived,” says Clarke.
  “It is almost like just throwing the plants up in the air, and you’re planting
  them where they land.” Think about lighting “Adding festoon lights into a
  garden makes it instantly feel really intimate and a nice place to sit out in
  the evening,” says Malt. “That is a tip from my own garden that I think has
  made such a difference. A mirror is brilliant in a small space too.” “I’m not
  a massive fan of outdoor lighting,” says Stewart. “Similarly to irrigation,
  you end up with wires through the soil, and it makes it much less comfortable
  to garden. Also it’s not good for wildlife: lights going on and off at night
  can be really disruptive for them. A few lanterns or candles on tables, to me,
  is much more romantic and inviting.” Create a wildlife-friendly space “It’s
  not just about your plants, it’s about everything else that may visit your
  space, whether that’s a fox or a pigeon,” says Clarke. “Some form of water is
  always good,” says Malt. “It doesn’t have to be a water feature. You can make
  tiny ponds out of any container. Just have something for birds to drink from.”
  “Ponds can attract all manner of wildlife,” says Clarke, “like insects, frogs
  and hedgehogs.” Malt also advises putting in pollinator-friendly plants:
  “Provide really good sources of nectar and look at winter-flowering plants,
  such as ivy.” Don’t obsess over weeding “Look at weeds in a different light,”
  says Clarke. “Often, the weeds in our gardens are indigenous, and the bees
  tend to go for them more than they do the plants that we import. So I’m one
  for being a bit more relaxed: don’t trim your lawn to within an inch of its
  life; maybe let the shrubs get a bit shaggy. They don’t have to be neat and
  prim and proper. Let them do their own thing. The wildlife will thank you for
  it.” Consider a bulb lasagne “Gardens planted in autumn seem to be the
  happiest,” says Malt. It is the ideal time to plan for the year ahead and
  planting bulbs is a good starting point: “There isn’t a mega rush, but start
  thinking about planting in the autumn. “Doing a bulb lasagne – layering bulbs
  in a container so there is a succession of flowers throughout the spring, with
  later flowering ones at the bottom, and earlier flowering ones at the top – is
  flipping brilliant. We do really outrageously clashing, distasteful pots of
  tulips, muscari and smaller daffodils.” “In terms of planting, you want a bit
  of a discordant, jarring note to it,” says Stewart, “like a pastel scheme with
  really bright orange dahlias in among it. That will give it more depth.”
  Choose failsafe plants “If you’re just starting out, and you don’t know what
  to combine with another plant, ornamental grasses are great,” says Clarke. “If
  you have a rose in your garden that doesn’t quite go with a pittosporum, split
  it with a grass – that will bridge the gap between two plants.” Feather grass
  is his go-to. “Most hardy geraniums are brilliant,” says Malt, “such as Ann
  Folkard and Tiny Monster. They fill up a space really quickly, and they are
  gorgeous. Peonies and dahlias are pretty easy to grow, and you can do them in
  pots.” “One of my favourites is Erigeron, a little trailing daisy that is so
  useful in containers,” says Stewart. “It is one of those plants that if you
  repeat it, it will unite everything in a container scheme beautifully. But it
  becomes even more magical when it starts to self-sow, jumping into the cracks
  in paths and paving. It flowers all summer, and is one of those plants that
  makes a garden feel really established and lived in.”
