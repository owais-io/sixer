  The Taliban have called for international aid as Afghanistan reels from an
  earthquake that killed more than 900 people and left thousands injured.
  Rescuers searched into the night on Monday for survivors after the
  6.0-magnitude quake struck on Sunday destroying entire villages across the
  country’s eastern Kunar province, which borders Pakistan. Many remained
  trapped under the debris of mud and stone homes built into steep valleys, but
  rescuers struggled to reach remote areas due to rough mountainous terrain and
  inclement weather. It was a shallow earthquake, taking place just six miles
  beneath the earth’s surface, which is known to have a particularly destructive
  impact. Yousaf Hammad, a spokesperson for Afghanistan’s National Disaster
  Management Authority, said on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 900,
  with 3,000 people injured. Authorities said they expected casualties to rise
  further once rescue teams reached more isolated locations, many of which
  remained inaccessible more than 24 hours after the earthquake struck. Sharafat
  Zaman, a spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, called for
  international aid to tackle the devastation wrought by the quake that struck
  at around midnight local time. “We need it because here lots of people lost
  their lives and houses,” he said. Afghanistan was already suffering from a
  severe economic crisis and a crippling withdrawal of international aid after
  the takeover of the country by the Taliban in 2021. Hardline Taliban policies
  such as a ban on female education and employment have spurred on a sharp drop
  in international aid funding and humanitarian assistance to the country. The
  disaster will further stretch the resources of the war-torn nation’s Taliban
  administration, which is also grappling with the return of hundreds of
  thousands of Afghans deported by Iran and Pakistan in recent weeks. The quake
  razed three villages in Kunar and caused substantial damage in many others,
  authorities said. At least 610 people were killed in Kunar and there were 12
  dead in Nangarhar, they added. Some villagers sat weeping amid the piled ruins
  of their homes. Others began laboriously clearing the debris by hand, or
  carried out the injured on makeshift stretchers. “This is Mazar Dara in Nurgal
  district. The entire village has been destroyed,” one victim told reporters.
  “Children and elders are trapped under the rubble. We need urgent help.”
  Another survivor said: “We need ambulances, we need doctors, we need
  everything to rescue the injured and recover the dead.” In Kunar, the dead,
  some of them children, were wrapped in white shrouds by villagers who prayed
  over their bodies before burying them, while helicopters ferried the wounded
  to hospitals. Rescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off
  from mobile networks along the Pakistani border, where mudbrick homes dotting
  the slopes collapsed in the quake. Military rescue teams fanned out across the
  region, the defence ministry said, with 40 flights carrying away 420 wounded
  and dead. Kate Carey, an officer at the UN Office for the coordination of
  Humanitarian Affairs, told Reuters: “The area of the earthquake was affected
  by heavy rain in the last 24 to 48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides
  and rock slides is also quite significant – that is why many of the roads are
  impassable.” On Monday, Britain set out emergency funding support for those
  affected by the recent earthquakes, saying it would ensure that the aid does
  not go to the Taliban administration by channelling it through its partners. A
  spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said it was ready to provide
  disaster relief assistance “according to Afghanistan’s needs and within its
  capacity”. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said it had
  delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food to
  Kunar, with more relief material to be sent from India starting on Tuesday.
  The US state department posted its condolences on X on Monday for the loss of
  life in the earthquake but did not immediately respond when asked if the US
  would provide any assistance.
