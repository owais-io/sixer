  Just as opposing fans in the Premier League have experienced feelings of dread
  over the past decade when Son Heung-min picked up the ball on the edge of
  their area, there had been a summer of worry among his millions of followers
  in Asia that his time in England was coming to an end. As the South Korean’s
  legs slowed last season, reports of a move elsewhere gathered pace. His 10
  years at Tottenham may have ended with a trophy, the Europa League in May, but
  the legacy had been in place for some time. The 33-year-old has changed the
  way Asian players are perceived around the world and much more besides. “It
  was the most difficult decision I have made in my career,” an emotional Son
  said at a Seoul press conference on Saturday before Sunday’s pre-season
  exhibition against Newcastle. “Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make
  the decision. I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of
  change – 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years
  old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man.”
  Son has been the pride of Asian football for years, the first player from the
  continent to become a genuine Premier League star, a legend at his club. There
  had been compatriot Park Ji-sung who won titles and respect during seven years
  at Manchester United, but he was never an automatic starter and, unfairly for
  a technically excellent and intelligent player, old Three Lungs was praised
  more for his running, work-rate and stamina. Shinji Kagawa looked as if he may
  reach the next level at Old Trafford but was soon back in Germany. So it was
  Son, signed from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, who went on to appear on billboards
  in north London, Seoul and a lot of cities in between as one of the best-known
  faces of the world’s best-known league. There were 173 goals in 454
  competitive games, including the 2020 Puskás Award for that strike against
  Burnley. In the 2021-2022 season, he scored 23 in the league, sharing the
  golden boot with Mohamed Salah, another milestone for Asian football. When
  Harry Kane left Spurs for Bayern Munich, Son stayed and was made captain, and
  while last season was a relative struggle, for team and player, it ended on a
  high. Some thought he may stay for one more crack at the Champions League,
  after doing so much to help Spurs to the final in 2019, but it was not to be.
  In 2022, I went to Tottenham’s sparkling training ground on the northern
  outskirts of the capital to present the Chuncheon-born native with the Best
  Footballer in Asia award, a trophy handed out by Titan Sports in China, a
  country that is not known for its love of Korean football but one that has the
  utmost respect for Elder Brother Son. He had received the prize in all but
  three of the 12 years since it became a thing. We discussed our favourite food
  from his homeland while he tried not to laugh at the Korean language attempts
  of Hugo Lloris in the next room as the goalkeeper recorded a video message to
  fans in the Land of the Morning Calm before the club’s visit a few weeks
  later. Tottenham are there once more. “It’s very clear that Sonny will start
  and lead the team out as captain,” the new Tottenham head coach, Thomas Frank,
  said. “If that is the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it here in front
  of his home fans. It could be a beautiful ending.” And an emotional one. His
  Premier League performances will be missed in Korea, not least by those bars
  that hang huge televisions in their windows, showing Tottenham games with a
  tiny image of his smiling face in the top corner of the screen to show their
  idol is on the field. Playing time is a big thing for Korean fans after most
  of Son’s predecessors struggled. Park Chu-young joined Arsenal in 2011 but
  managed just seven league minutes in the red and white corner of north London,
  inactivity that caused some resentment back home. Son’s experience was the
  opposite. Playing regularly, becoming a star for so long and then captain at a
  major club also helped grow Tottenham’s global fanbase. While European
  estimates of their fans in Asia are unconfirmed, it was claimed in 2022 that
  there were more than 12 million Spurs supporters in Korea. Whatever the
  accuracy of that number, there has never been such a popular player – Son has
  advertised more than 30 brands in his homeland – to play in such a popular
  league for such a length of time. Tottenham will need to find a way to build
  on his legacy in Korea and the rest of Asia. For now, though, they just have
  to find a way to live without Son on the pitch. And fans of the player on the
  world’s biggest continent will also have to get used to Premier League action
  without the forward. A Chinese journalist once said that Son showed the world
  that Asia can produce a player as exciting as any from Africa or South
  America. As legacies go, that’s pretty good.
