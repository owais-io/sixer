  My former English teacher Willie Jones, who has died aged 94, was an
  inspirational guide to thousands of students in the UK and, later, Japan. He
  combined a passion for texts with a warmth and patience that made the analysis
  of writing an adventure. He could have become a students’ guru but shrank from
  leadership; his talent was a gentle helping hand. He wrote voluminously but
  suffered agonies over clarity and precision. His eyes welled when reciting
  Shakespeare. Born in Hereford, Willie was the eldest of the three children of
  Alice (nee Morris), who dreamed of teaching but was apprenticed to a
  dressmaker at 14, and Bill Jones, a butcher. Bill had left school at 11;
  Willie’s parents and some perceptive teachers at Hereford high school for boys
  helped him to gain a place to study English at St Catharine’s College,
  Cambridge. Before university, two years’ national service, including a
  commission as a second lieutenant, widened his world. He corresponded with
  army friends and pupils for the rest of his life. In 1956 he taught on
  placement at Shrewsbury school in Shropshire, returning in 1959 after a spell
  at St Bees school in Cumbria and becoming head of English before setting off
  across the world to teach at Hokkaido University in Sapporo in 1979. Willie
  was loved at Shrewsbury, where he galvanised drama classes, was an outstanding
  pastoral teacher and a long-distance runner, but Japanese culture brought out
  his best. It led to the flowering of a fascination with craftsmanship, dating
  back to his father’s skill, which was the opposite of “butchery” in the
  pejorative sense. Writing was his craft, and he applied it to studies of the
  relationship between English and Japanese, and essays on the craftsmen and
  craftswomen of Hokkaido. These became a book, while he continued to teach as
  an emeritus professor, the first foreigner to hold the title, until a few
  months before his death. Watching a Zoom class last year on As You Like It
  instantly brought back 1960s Shrewsbury for me. Willie was looked after in his
  last years by a devoted family in Sapporo after the state system was unwilling
  to maintain support for a foreign citizen. Masa and Ai Ikeda and their
  children, Hina and Sora, became his second family as well as carers and took
  his ashes to be scattered on Coles Tump in Herefordshire, where he had played
  as a boy. He had called the area “that in-between border-land which is not
  quite one thing, not quite the other, from which I have always needed to take
  my own liminal bearings”. He is survived by his brother, Robert, sister,
  Rosemary, and nieces, Gwen and Emma.
