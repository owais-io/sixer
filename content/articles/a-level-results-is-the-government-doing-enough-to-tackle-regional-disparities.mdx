  A-level results: is the government doing enough to tackle regional
  disparities?

  One of the messages the education secretary was keen to get across during her
  media round on A-level results was the government’s commitment to tackling the
  “yawning inequalities” in educational attainment in England. Bridget
  Phillipson, a Sunderland MP who grew up in the north-east, is all too well
  aware of educational disadvantage and how some regions are worse affected than
  others. In the run-up to results day, she has made a point of drawing
  attention to poor exam outcomes for students from white working-class
  backgrounds. She says the government’s “plan for change”, which includes
  reformed early years and revitalised family services, alongside wider efforts
  to tackle disadvantage such as expanding free school meals and free breakfast
  clubs, will help address inequalities. But is it enough to bring about real
  change? Regional disparities in education are nothing new, but what has
  concerned experts is that this year’s results reveal that the gap between the
  strongest and weakest performing areas in England has grown even wider. The
  gap in A and A* grades between the highest performing area, London, where
  almost a third of students got at least an A, and the north-east, which
  remains the lowest performing, has grown to 9.2 percentage points – the widest
  regional gap since at least 2019. While in the capital, 32.1% of A-level
  entries were awarded A or A*, up from 31.3% in 2024, in the north-east the
  proportion of top grades dropped from 23.9% in 2024 to 22.9%. The West
  Midlands is the other region in England with a year-on-year drop in top grades
  – down from 24.8% to 24.2%. England’s exams regulator, Ofqual, said that the
  differences in grades between schools within regions was actually larger than
  the aggregated differences between regions. Nevertheless, the chief regulator,
  Sir Ian Bauckham, said he shared the sector’s disappointment at the widening
  gap and welcomed Phillipson’s focus on the issue. According to experts,
  persistent poverty, deep-rooted structural inequalities and the long-tail of
  Covid are all contributing to the divide. Chris Zarraga, the director of
  Schools North East, which represents more than 1,150 schools in the region,
  said: “North-east students have done brilliantly again this year, but the
  structural gap between our region and London has grown yet again. “This is not
  about school quality. Every August, our students prove their talent and
  determination. But we cannot keep pretending the gap [between the north-east
  and London] is about standards. It is about deep-rooted structural
  inequalities that no government has seriously addressed. Without urgent,
  sustained action to tackle them, the gap will keep widening, and it will not
  be because our students or teachers are any less capable.” Henri Murison, the
  chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, also blamed
  “significant and deep-seated regional disparities” for the attainment gap.
  Students who chose not to do A-levels or underperform “do so as a result of
  their background, including coming from a disadvantaged family”, he said. “The
  pandemic has had long-lasting consequences and the grades our young people are
  using to apply for the most competitive university or apprenticeship places
  remain lower than those in regions such as London.” The gulf between
  university application rates in London and the north-east has grown from 19%
  to 26%. So what needs to be done? The partnership has called for pupil premium
  – which targets additional funding at students from the most disadvantaged
  backgrounds – to be restored to its full real-terms value, with a top-up for
  persistently disadvantaged children. There have also been calls for pupil
  premium to be extended to 16- to 19-year-olds. Natalie Perera, the chief
  executive of the Education Policy Institute, said: “We can’t ignore the fact
  that one of the main drivers is the higher and more persistent poverty in some
  areas.” Perera also called for “targeted investment in high quality teaching
  at all stages of education and, crucially, a fully funded cross-government
  child poverty strategy”. She added: “The other thing we know that makes a real
  difference is the quality of teachers. We know from our own research that
  schools in disadvantaged areas particularly outside London struggle to recruit
  high-quality, highly qualified teachers.” Perera suggested there should be
  financial incentives to attract top teachers to schools serving disadvantaged
  communities. She also proposed incentives for schools to reduce exclusions,
  which disproportionately affect disadvantaged children. Is the government
  doing enough to close the gaps? “Not yet,” said Perera.
