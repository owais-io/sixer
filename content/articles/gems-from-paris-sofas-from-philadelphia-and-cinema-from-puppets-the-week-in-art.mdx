  Exhibition of the week Millet: Life on the Land The Musée d’Orsay has lent
  Millet’s iconic Angelus for this journey to the dark side of the landscape. •
  National Gallery, London, until 19 October Also showing Aubrey Levinthal
  Superb, subtle paintings from the streets and sofas of Philadelphia. • Ingleby
  Gallery, Edinburgh, until 13 September Wael Shawky Brilliant cinematic
  retellings of the history of east and west, plus the surreal marionettes and
  sculptures that star in them. • Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, until 28
  September Tai Shani Shani’s public sculpture The Spell or the Dream celebrates
  25 years of Somerset House as an art venue. • Somerset House, London, until 14
  September Andy Warhol Powerful examples of Warhol’s work from the Artist Rooms
  collection cast a cool, far-seeing eye on the modern world. • Lightbox
  Gallery, Woking, until 2 November Image of the week Bridging art and politics,
  Peter Kennard has produced some of our most influential images of resistance
  and dissent since the 1970s. Gaza, his new exhibition of graphic work,
  showcases multimedia prints he has made in response to the daily news reports
  and footage of the near-erasure of Gaza and the thousands of Palestinians
  killed. It runs alongside the Edinburgh festival at Palestine Museum Scotland,
  9-31 August. What we learned A terrific Edinburgh art festival show combines
  queer kings and modern wonders The Whitney’s “Untitled” show reopens the book
  on American history Spacecraft designers have seen the future … and it’s
  vegetarian and polyamorous With teamwork and determination, a group of
  Indigenous basket weavers in the Australian desert took the art world by storm
  Pop star Kate Jackson has reinvented herself as an artist of Britain’s
  motorways The performance artist, set designer and director Robert Wilson
  never stopped pushing boundaries Copenhagen has a second Little Mermaid statue
  – and it’s got to go Juergen Teller’s coffee-table book about Auschwitz is
  shockingly bland Stanley Donwood looked back on 30 years creating Radiohead’s
  artwork Masterpiece of the week Landscape With a Watermill by François
  Boucher, 1755 In this painting from about a century before Millet’s barren
  peasant scene The Angelus, the French countryside looks a much cheerier place.
  Soft focus trees form a velvety blue-green sanctuary for a mill whose
  dilapidation and decay strikes Boucher as delightfully picturesque. In fact,
  it doesn’t look like a real place at all but a dreamy idyll, inspired by
  Chinese landscape scenes which were hugely popular in 18th-century Europe. You
  can picture Boucher’s aristocratic clients delighting in this view of country
  life and even having a water mill like this one built as a garden folly beside
  their water feature. And yet, a drawing by Boucher apparently of this place
  suggests it may actually depict a real water mill beside the Seine. • National
