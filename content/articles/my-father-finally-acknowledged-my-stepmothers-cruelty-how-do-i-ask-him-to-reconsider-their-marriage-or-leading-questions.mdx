  I have a stepmother who my brother and I really despise. She has made our
  relationship with our dad really hard, and has tried to stop him seeing us at
  points. She has resented us since we were little. My dad has recently admitted
  that he thinks she is jealous of us and has a lot of regret for the way we
  were treated in the past. The trouble lies in the fact that he has said if
  anything happens to him (ie if he dies first) we would need to make an effort
  with her will-wise, to ensure we were treated fairly, as he doesn’t quite
  trust she would do the right thing. It feels incredibly hard to acknowledge
  this and agree when he has essentially admitted he doesn’t trust her with his
  dying wish. I also find it really hard to deal with the fact he is finally
  acknowledging how cruel she has been, but still insists we have a
  relationship. It makes me think he’s a coward. I really want to bring this up
  to him, but have no idea how to say: “Do you not think you should reconsider
  your marriage, based on the way in which you have shown you don’t trust your
  wife, and believe she is jealous of your children?” Eleanor says: First
  non-philosophical thing: if you haven’t already, I think you should get legal
  advice about the will. Is it that he might die intestate, and he’s hoping
  you’ll all sort it out? Or has he made arrangements, but worries she might
  challenge them? Legal advice would clarify what can be done now to avoid a
  horrible tangle later. That’s hard – nobody likes to get into the details
  about their dad’s death. Or indeed their own. But it’ll be so much harder,
  emotionally and legally, if your first advice about a possible estate conflict
  only comes after he’s died. To your question. You said you weren’t sure how to
  say what you wanted to say. When we say “I can’t figure out how to say
  such-and-such”, I always think the answer is to just say the such-and-such.
  You wrote it: “Do you not think you should reconsider your marriage, based on
  the ways you don’t trust your wife, and believe she’s jealous of your
  children?” A heady thing to say, for sure. But it’s not the word choice that
  makes it heady. You’d be asking your dad why he’s still married. You can
  soften the phrasing, but it’s the content of that question that makes us
  flinch, not the way of asking it. More frightening still is the fact that he
  might have an answer. Through your (and my) eyes that question is almost
  rhetorical: why stay married to someone you don’t trust and who’s mean to your
  kids? However, the fact that they are still married and that he wants you to
  have a relationship with her means that, for him, there might well be an
  answer. He might have considerations on the other side of the scale that
  outweigh the fact that she’s mean to his kids. Maybe he likes her enough.
  Maybe he doesn’t want to be alone. Maybe he thinks he’s too old, he’s not
  willing to make the change. Maybe he thinks the conflicts between her and his
  kids aren’t his concern. Maybe what look like obvious dealbreakers to you are
  just some considerations among many for him. The point is, your real question
  for him might be an even bigger flinch. Not just “why won’t you act on your
  judgment?”, but “why isn’t it your judgment that you should leave?” It’s
  possible he has bona fide answers – things that, to him, are more important
  than the way she treats you. It is hard to say which would hurt more: him not
  being brave enough to act on what he values, or this being exactly what it
  looks like when he does. I truly don’t know which of these it is. I feel for
  you the same in both cases. I don’t know whether you should ask him either
  question out loud; I don’t know how conversations with him tend to go, or
  whether his answer would make you feel better. I do know that when someone
  isn’t acting on what they say they see, it isn’t always that they lack the
  courage of their convictions. Sometimes they’re showing us their convictions
  through inaction. Ask Eleanor a question
