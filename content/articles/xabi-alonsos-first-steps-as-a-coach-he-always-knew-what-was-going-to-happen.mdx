  On 19 August Real Madrid start their new La Liga campaign at home against
  Osasuna with Xabi Alonso in charge for his first league game. That would have
  seemed unthinkable only three years ago when he had just taken over at Bayer
  Leverkusen. He admitted thinking: “What am I doing here? … Why did we hire
  this guy from Real Sociedad B?” but the Bundesliga side knew what they were
  doing. Within two years he had taken them to a historic double as well as the
  Europa League final. The 2023-24 league title was secured by going undefeated.
  Last season they finished second behind Bayern Munich – no mean feat – and on
  25 May he was confirmed as Carlo Ancelotti’s replacement as manager for Los
  Blancos. After a Club World Cup ending in a 4-0 semi-final defeat to Paris
  Saint-Germain the 43-year-old faces arguably the biggest challenge of his
  career. “I was surprised by what he did at Leverkusen,” says Gaizka Ayesa, who
  played under Alonso for Real Sociedad B from 2020 to 2022. “I knew what kind
  of coach he was and what he could do but to go so long without losing … I
  think even he was surprised.” Pressing, tactics and video work To truly
  understand Alonso’s rise, you have to go back to his beginnings. To start out
  as a coach, the Basque returned to his first love, Real Sociedad, where he had
  launched his playing career. With the reserve team, where he spent three years
  and achieved a historic promotion to Spain’s second division (2019-22), the
  Tolosa-born former midfielder worked diligently in the shadows, without any
  pressure but with already well-defined principles. “His goal was to develop a
  very offensive style of play with quick ball recoveries after losing
  possession. The idea was to create gaps and exploit them as fast as possible,”
  recalls Théo Lucbert, a winger for Poitiers who trained under Alonso at Real
  Sociedad. “His style was a bit different from what you see now. Back then, he
  liked his full-backs to help more in the middle of the pitch, whereas at
  Bayer, they play almost like wingers.” And this is perhaps what you would call
  the “Xabi touch”: tactical adaptability. The 2010 World Cup winner with Spain
  is a master at maximising his players’ strengths while minimising their
  weaknesses through subtle adjustments. “He prepared us for matches extremely
  well,” says Imanol Ezkurdia, a centre-back at Guijuelo, who had just under
  three seasons under Alonso’s guidance. “He always knew exactly what was going
  to happen. He would tell us: ‘This and this and this will happen,’ and then it
  actually did. It was impressive.” Alonso made heavy use of video analysis
  before matches. “We did a ton of video work,” says Ezkurdia. “He mainly showed
  us footage of ourselves – our training sessions and previous matches – to
  highlight what we were doing well and what needed improving. Then we would
  work on those things in training. After that, everything became easier.
  Sometimes, though, he would also show us clips of our opponents.” Lucbert
  adds: “Xabi used video to show us how he wanted us to play, especially
  transitions in possession and when pressing. But he spent even more time on
  the pitch with us, drilling movement and decision-making so it all became
  automatic.” The new Real Madrid manager leaves nothing to chance. Every
  player’s role was orchestrated like a perfectly tuned symphony. “He wanted me
  to help a lot out of possession, to run into space, and to stay very mobile so
  I could press in a very organised way,” says the forward Jorge Aguirre, who
  played for Alonso during the 2022-23 season and is now at Gil Vicente.
  Ezkurdia was tasked with building out from the back – and to do it
  effectively: “At the time, we played a four-man defence with two centre-backs.
  I sometimes played in the middle and sometimes at full-back but I had a lot of
  freedom. We worked a lot on passing patterns and playing out from the back:
  short passes, long passes … In the end, I really improved my ball control.”
  Respect in the dressing room To lead his teams to success, Alonso also places
  a strong emphasis on human connection and emotional control. Very close to his
  players, he carries an aura that makes the squad members respect him. “The
  first time he walked into the dressing room, I remember being completely
  star-struck, even panicked,” smiles Ezkurdia. “I had watched him for years on
  TV, winning all those titles, a World Cup, Champions Leagues … He was really
  my idol. “I remember he would sometimes play with us during training – and he
  was still the best! He loved having the ball at his feet. When we trained with
  him everything felt easier. Sometimes I had to defend against him … His touch
  was unreal, and he cracked a lot of jokes, too.” Ayesa adds. “He was very
  close to us. All the canteranos loved him.” Alonso’s competitiveness also went
  down well with the players. “He had a particular strength: he wanted to win
  above all else,” says Aguirre. “His mentality helped us; you could see that he
  wanted to do things in a big way. He wanted us to play every game as if we
  were going to die.” During Alonso’s second season with Real Sociedad B they
  won promotion to the Segunda División, a level they had not been at since
  1962. They won their playoff semi-final against FC Andorra before beating
  Algeciras thanks to an extra-time goal from Jon Karrikaburu. “The final was
  really incredible,” says Aguirre. “Before the game, Xabi was very calm. On the
  day of the match, he just told us to stay calm and play our football. And it
  worked.” For Ezkurdia, the memory is still vivid: “For me, it was the best
  year of my career. We played some amazing football, we trained amazingly well,
  and on top of that, we got promoted … What more could you ask for?” At the
  final whistle, the celebration matched their effort on the pitch. Champagne
  flowing, photos with the fans, Basque flags, singing and dancing. “It was a
  huge moment,” says Ayesa. “To have that chance to play in the second division
  was something crazy for us because we were all so young and so happy. We
  celebrated it with him after we won.” The following season was more difficult.
  Relegation followed but nobody could take away that sensational 2020-21
  campaign from those players. Now Alonso is back in Spain ready to write the
  next chapter. Will his methods work with the superstars at Real Madrid?
  History suggests he will find a way.
