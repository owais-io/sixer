  Giorgio Armani, the celebrated Italian fashion designer who built a global
  empire has died, his company said on Thursday. He was 91. “With infinite
  sorrow, the Armani Group announces the passing of its creator, founder and
  tireless driving force: Giorgio Armani,” the fashion house said in a
  statement. His vast portfolio included the Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani
  apparel lines alongside the haute couture label Armani Privé and an Armani
  Casa design and interiors line. He was absent from his last three shows, held
  in June and July, owing to illness. He had been expected to attend the brand’s
  50th anniversary celebrations later this month including a landmark exhibition
  at the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan. The founder and sole shareholder of
  Giorgio Armani SpA, Armani reportedly refused numerous offers throughout his
  career to become part of one of the big four luxury fashion conglomerates. He
  described the independence of his brand as “an essential value”. His inaugural
  1975 presentation pioneered the idea of soft power dressing, earning him the
  title “King of the Blazer”. His proposition of fluid rather than structured
  suiting featuring longer-cut suit jackets, loosely pleated trousers and
  floor-sweeping belted coats formed an entirely new approach to dressing. He
  applied the same techniques to womenswear, freeing many from the fussy and
  figure-hugging silhouettes prescribed by other brands. His muted colour
  palette of greys and beige became synonymous with stealth wealth, long before
  the idea of quiet luxury entered the lexicon. In 1980 the brand was catapulted
  to international fame when Richard Gere wore numerous pieces designed by
  Armani in the film American Gigolo. This also pioneered a new way of working
  with Hollywood. While in the past couturiers had a relationship with one such
  specific star, such as Hubert de Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn, Armani had
  multiple. In 1978, Diane Keaton became the first actor to wear Armani on the
  Oscars red carpet. Jodie Foster has worn it to every ceremony but one since
  1989, while Julia Roberts’ 1990 look of a steel grey oversized Armani suit
  teamed with a white shirt and tie has become one of the most memorable Golden
  Globes looks of all time. Born in Piacenza in northern Italy in 1934, Armani
  originally pursued a career in medicine. He left the University of Milan
  before completing his degree to join the army. Shortly afterwards he began
  looking for a different type of career. “I got into fashion almost by accident
  and then it slowly grew in me until it completely absorbed me, stealing my
  life away,” he previously said. After working as a window dresser and later a
  sales associate at La Rinascente, a notable department store in Milan, he took
  on a menswear design role at Nino Cerruti. Armani was 41 when he launched his
  own label. It was his partner Sergio Galeotti, an architect by training who
  convinced him to sell his Volkswagen Beetle to fund his own company. Galeotti
  ran the books while Armani focused on the creative side. When Galeotti died in
  1995, Armani continued alone. Armani-branded products generated £3.5bn in
  2021. They included a collection of hotels, restaurants, nightclubs,
  cosmetics, chocolates and even floristry. Armani liked to keep the business
  within the family. After his spring/summer 2022 collection, Armani for the
  first time took his bow alongside Leo Dell’Orco, the head of the men’s style
  office, who originally joined the company in 1977. When asked in a 2022
  interview how he’d liked to be remembered, Armani replied: “As a sincere man.
  I say what I mean.”
