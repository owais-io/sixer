  The US has begun denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine
  Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) in advance of
  the UN general assembly meeting in September, the state department said on
  Friday. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was
  included in the restrictions. Abbas had been planning to travel to New York to
  deliver an address to the UN general assembly. Abbas’ office said it was
  astonished by the visa decision and argued that it violated the UN
  “headquarters agreement”. Under an agreement as host of the UN in New York,
  the US is not supposed to refuse visas for officials heading to the world body
  for the general assembly, but the state department said it was complying with
  the agreement by allowing the Palestinian mission to attend. “The Trump
  administration has been clear: it is in our national security interests to
  hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and
  for undermining the prospects for peace,” the state department said in a
  statement. The new measure further aligns Donald Trump’s administration with
  Israel’s rightwing government which adamantly rejects a Palestinian state.
  Israeli officials have repeatedly equated the broadly secular PA, which
  exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, with its bitter
  Islamist rival Hamas. Using a term favoured by Trump to deride his legal
  troubles while out of office, the state department accused the Palestinians of
  “lawfare” by raising grievances against Israel at the international criminal
  court and international court of justice. It called on the PA to drop “efforts
  to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state”. The
  Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, thanked the Trump administration “for
  this bold step and for standing by Israel once again” in a post on X. Stéphane
  Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said it was “important” for all states and
  observers, which includes the Palestinians, to be represented at a summit
  scheduled for the day before the general assembly begins. “We obviously hope
  that this will be resolved,” Dujarric said. The US statement justifying the
  new measure echoed claims often repeated by Israeli officials. “Before the PLO
  and PA can be considered partners for peace, they must consistently repudiate
  terrorism – including the 7 October massacre – and end incitement to terrorism
  in education,” it said. The PLO was founded in 1964 as an umbrella
  organisation for Palestinian factions and recognised a decade later as the
  sole political representative of the Palestinian people. The PA was set up
  almost 20 years later as an interim body that would provide an institutional
  framework for a Palestinian state. Both are likely to be integral to any
  future Palestinian state. Arab powers, the UK, European countries and others
  want the PA to take a central role in the administration of Gaza if the
  conflict can be ended, though they agree it needs reform. Australia, Canada,
  the UK and France are to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general
  assembly next month if certain conditions are met, in a move that has
  infuriated Israel. Israel’s government has rejected any role for the PA in
  Gaza and said that recognition “rewards Hamas’s monstrous terrorism”. Though
  Israel’s government is under mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its
  offensive in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has ordered
  military forces to launch an assault to seize Gaza City. Once a major
  commercial and cultural hub, it has been reduced to ruins and is home to
  hundreds of thousands of destitute Palestinians after repeated rounds of
  fighting. The Israeli offensive has so far killed 63,000 people, mostly
  civilians, injured 150,000 and displaced the vast majority of the population.
  The UN last week declared a famine in and around Gaza City, blaming
  “systematic obstruction” by Israel of humanitarian aid deliveries. “We have
  begun preliminary operations and the initial stages of the attack on Gaza
  City, and we are currently operating with great force on the outskirts of the
  city,” Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesperson, said on X. The war
  was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel in October 2023 which
  killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 abducted. About 50 hostages
  remain in Gaza, of whom less than half are thought to be still alive.
  Activists each year press the US to deny visas to leaders of countries that
  they oppose, often over grave human rights violations, but their appeals are
  almost always rejected. In a historic step in 1988, the general assembly
  convened in Geneva rather than New York to hear the then PLO leader, Yasser
  Arafat, after the US refused to allow him in New York. Additional reporting by
