  The White House’s former top Latin America official has said he fears the US
  could stumble into a protracted guerrilla war in Venezuela after Donald Trump
  ordered a military strike on a boat in the Caribbean Sea, killing 11 alleged
  drug traffickers. Tuesday’s controversial strike off the Venezuelan coast –
  which was reportedly carried out by an attack helicopter or Reaper drone –
  came after the US president ordered a major naval deployment to the region,
  ostensibly to combat South American drug traffickers. On Wednesday, the
  secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, told Fox News the attack was designed to
  send a clear message to Venezuela’s authoritarian leader. “The only person
  that should be worried is Nicolás Maduro … who is effectively a kingpin of a
  narco-state,” Hegseth said, comparing the operation to US strikes on Iranian
  nuclear sites and Houthi targets in Yemen. The military buildup in the
  Caribbean has left some wondering if Trump is plotting to remove Maduro from
  power by force, despite the fact that in some ways his Venezuela policy has
  softened since he returned to the White House with the resumption of
  deportation flights and the easing of sanctions. Asked if the administration
  was seeking regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said that was a decision for
  the president, but added: “We are prepared with every asset that the American
  military has.” Speaking to the Guardian, Juan González, the national security
  council’s senior director for the western hemisphere during the Biden
  administration, called Trump’s naval deployment “a lot of political theatre”.
  But he cautioned: “[There is a] very high risk of military confrontation.” “I
  increasingly fear that the Trump administration may stumble into an
  intervention scenario in Venezuela, which would be frankly disastrous,” said
  Biden’s former aide, who believed US Venezuela policy was now largely being
  dictated by hardline members of the Venezuelan opposition who had the ear of
  Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, a longtime Venezuela hawk. “I think
  they ultimately want to try to get the US in a situation where there’s a
  conflict with Venezuela. I think that’s the goal,” said González, who also
  served in the Obama administration. González said there would be huge risks in
  any US attempt to militarily remove Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian heir, who has
  governed since being elected in 2013 and was accused of stealing last year’s
  election. “After a quarter century of Chavismo, the idea that you replace the
  president and all of a sudden you have a Jeffersonian democracy is a little
  bit naive,” he said. Instead, González feared South America’s sixth largest
  country could become the stage for “a protracted internal conflict” involving
  a variety of armed groups including government-linked paramilitary forces,
  criminal organizations and Colombian rebels of the National Liberation Army
  (ELN), whose reach stretches from Venezuela’s western border hundreds of miles
  into the interior. “It’ll become the cause celebre for every kind of criminal
  or illegal armed group in the Americas … You’ll end up having people going to
  Venezuela to fight the Yankees and I think it’ll get messy,” González
  predicted. “I think the United States traditionally is able to fight head-on
  wars very effectively. But we’re not very good at guerrilla war – and that’s
  kind of what a lot of these groups have been doing for over half a century.
  “The reality is that today the ingredients all exist for there to be an
  internal conflict inside of Venezuela, not unlike the one that Colombia has
  been living through for over 50 years,” González added. The former White House
  official is not alone in fearing what could happen in Venezuela if a US
  military intervention comes to pass, even if some former US diplomats doubt
  that is Trump’s plan. “I believe that this more about a show of force and not
  about a utilization of force,” James Story, the US’s top diplomat for
  Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, said of the naval buildup last week. “The one
  thing about President Trump is that, notwithstanding his strike in Iran, he
  has traditionally been against … meddling militarily in the affairs of other
  countries,” Story added. Adam Isacson, a defense and security specialist from
  the Washington Office on Latin America, was skeptical that Venezuela was about
  to suffer “a Panama-style invasion on steroids”. Thousands of US troops were
  required and hundreds of lives lost when George HW Bush ordered his 1989
  operation to topple Manuel Noriega, the Central American country’s dictator.
  “Venezuela just is far bigger, far more complex and does have the seeds of an
  insurgency,” Isacson said. “The idea of guerrilla warfare and chipping away
  and carrying out terrorist attacks and just making the cost too high for the
  US occupiers is a very likely scenario,” he added.
