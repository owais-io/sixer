  UK viewers over the age of 55 watched almost twice as much YouTube last year
  as they did in 2023, with 42% of them watching on a TV, according to a survey
  by the communications regulator Ofcom. Here, six people over 50 describe why
  they prefer YouTube and how it compares with the broadcast TV they grew up
  with. ‘YouTube is very personal and you feel involved’ YouTube is full of
  hidden gems and many videos are made by ordinary people. There’s so much more
  on offer in one place than other streaming services or broadcast channels.
  Also, some streaming channels can be difficult to navigate to find what you
  want. At the moment, I’m really enjoying reaction videos. One of my favourites
  is Regeneration Nation TV where an American duo react to music, comedians and
  TV shows like Fawlty Towers. They’re fun to watch and you feel involved. I
  also think it’s helpful for those who feel lonely – it’s almost like the
  people in these videos are with you. I used to work as a volunteer for the
  Samaritans so I can understand loneliness. I feel YouTube fills a need that
  other services don’t. It’s very personal and is a place where you can find
  anything, and often find what you’re looking for. Lloyd , 62, disabled and
  unemployed, Kent ‘Terrestrial TV just feels old-fashioned’ YouTube offers so
  much content that aligns with my interests and hobbies including music,
  photography, science and movie reviews. Not to mention it’s all on demand and
  much of it is available in bite-size form (15 to 20 minutes). For dramas and
  films, I use streaming services. Now in my late 50s, I also really value
  YouTube’s treasure trove of live music performances – there’s always something
  new or nostalgic to discover. There is just nothing on traditional TV that
  comes anywhere close to the choice and niche subjects that I can find on
  YouTube, like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop tutorials. While I occasionally
  miss watching live events (women’s football, or Ozzy Osbourne’s funeral), I
  don’t feel I’m missing out. Steve, 50s, customer services manager,
  Gloucestershire ‘I like how short content is on YouTube’ I like how short
  content is on YouTube, making it easy to watch something while you’re eating
  in the kitchen. I prefer it to other streaming services for the wide choice of
  things to watch. My favourite shows are when people are making something out
  of nothing, whether it’s the Great Pottery Throwdown or Rust Valley where they
  do up old cars. I had a TV licence because I didn’t want to have a problem
  with the authorities thinking I watch the television, even though I didn’t. I
  rescinded it recently, though, as I don’t think the BBC makes very good
  programmes any more. I’m not interested in their output and it feels very
  samey and boring. I’m also on a state pension and it was difficult to justify
  the fee. Andrea, 67, retired care worker, Bedfordshire ‘You can watch anything
  from deep space to quantum theory’ Watching broadcast TV is madness – having
  to see something at a specific time makes no sense. I stopped about 20 years
  ago when Tivo came out, and over time not watching TV got easier once
  broadband improved and there were more streaming services. YouTube is so much
  better than others as you can watch anything from deep space to quantum
  theory. I like watching really detailed scientific videos that are
  overwhelmingly technical. One channel is PBS Eons, which is about the history
  of life on Earth. I find that TV is too long-winded and the episode recaps
  make me feel like I have a memory of a goldfish – it drives me up the wall.
  Out of politeness, I still have a TV licence. I’ve heard stories of people not
  being able to prove they’re not watching TV and being taken to court. It’s
  more for my peace of mind. Stu Smith, 54, IT consultant, Ipswich ‘I just got
  fed up with terrestrial TV’ I watch YouTube because I can never find anything
  entertaining on terrestrial television. I really like to watch travel shows
  where I can sit at home and feel I can do things like climb in the Himalayas,
  trek in New Zealand or go to amazing restaurants in different countries. Even
  though I occasionally watched sport, I gave up my TV licence two years ago. I
  couldn’t abide so-called celebrities or look-at-me types who interrupted the
  programme so you get to look at their faces all the time. I don’t mean to be
  presenter-bashing, but when you get old you need to be a bit more calm in your
  life, and presenters tend to jump out the TV at you. I just got fed up with
  it. Gillian, 73, retired secretary, Stratford-upon-Avon ‘Whether you’re
  learning or relaxing, YouTube is much more precise than TV’ I’ve played in a
  few bands and do a lot of recording at home and in 2018 I started watching
  help videos for recording with Logic Pro X on YouTube. Then I found a lot of
  guitar tutors as I was studying for my grade 5 classical, then moved on to
  using the platform for science and history documentaries. Suddenly I could
  access a lot of information. I also like watching it on the TV as it’s more
  comfortable than sitting at a desk or using a laptop. I find the ability to
  scroll through a multitude of topics to find something that fits my mood much
  better than the offerings on TV. YouTube seems to offer the ability to immerse
  and satisfy, whether learning or relaxing, in a much more precise way than TV
  or other streaming services. Gerry McCart, 60, works in financial services,
