  ‘I am human, and nothing human is alien to me,” wrote Roman playwright Terence
  in 165BC. He hadn’t seen any of the Alien films, though. He hadn’t seen Alien
  or Aliens or Alien 3 , he hadn’t seen any of the Predator crossover canon, he
  hadn’t seen Resurrection or Prometheus or the one after Prometheus. He hadn’t
  even seen Alien: Romulus, even though it’s named after the guy who co-founded
  Rome. The Oscar-winning franchise has earned well over a billion dollars
  worldwide. There’s nothing more human than loving Alien. Part of the
  franchise’s success is its malleability. A creature-horror stuffed with
  Freudian nightmare, the films blend action, sci-fi, theology and satire. (I
  don’t want to be Frankenstein’s Pedant about it, but the monster is the
  profit-driven corporation determined to bring the alien to Earth to develop as
  a biological weapon.) Now that the IP belongs to Disney, we should expect many
  more instalments. But can they keep stretching the story into exciting shapes?
  Or are the days of Alien: Below Decks or The Real Housewives of Moon LV-426
  upon us? Thankfully, they’ve given control of Alien: Earth (Disney+, from
  Wednesday 13 August) to writer-director Noah Hawley, the TV genius responsible
  for Fargo and the dazzlingly ambitious Marvel series Legion. He takes us back
  a few years before the start of the first film, to an Earth run by a
  consortium of five tech companies. A deep space research vessel belonging to
  Weyland-Yutani, AKA Baddy Corp, crash-lands into a building owned by rival
  Prodigy. Guess what – there’s a very, very bad dog on board, and the Jurassic
  ovoids being transported? Not Kinder Eggs. The Alien movies’ main creature,
  the xenomorph, remains mesmerising. Rather than making an eight-hour slasher
  movie, Hawley uses its threat to explore a story about identity, the limits of
  AI and human weakness. An intriguing character is Boy Kavalier, the founder of
  Prodigy. To capture Weyland-Yutani’s extraterrestrial IP, he sends a party of
  his new creations: Hybrids. We see him secretly transferring the consciousness
  of terminally ill children into synthetic bodies, with tremendous strength and
  upgradable minds. Thank God our tech leaders are more responsible! This is one
  of my favourite tropes: evil genius motivated by lonely boredom. Boy Kavalier,
  who resembles Richard Hammond in a Bob Dylan wig, has created a new species
  simply because he wants someone to have an interesting conversation with. No
  one gets him. There is a twisted romance to that idea, if far-fetched. I mean,
  what does Elon Musk want? Someone to laugh at his jokes? Maybe that’s the same
  thing. The Hybrids are a great creation. Watching them, I was reminded of The
  Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. That documentary showed us infants playing,
  tracing the growth of recognisably adult behaviour. Kavalier’s prototypes kill
  and jump off cliffs, charged by lithium batteries that would power a city. Yet
  in the aftermath they are confused, worried about getting in trouble. They’re
  super-soldiers with the emotional age of children. Is there a current of
  identification between Hybrid and xenomorph? Is our enemy’s enemy our friend –
  or just another enemy? Do humans deserve to survive? The series plays with big
  questions. Yet this isn’t The Rest Is Aliens, a podcast about industrial
  espionage and existentialism. Its chief ambition is ramping up dread. And
  blood. Every episode is, frankly, an abattoir. New aliens have been designed
  that are blood-curdlingly creepy. The show boasts the sound design of the
  year, with chitinous clacking and background monkey whoops stoking constant
  unease. Even the casting is creepy, from child-adult Hybrids to Timothy
  Olyphant as an inscrutable robot scientist. Adrian Edmondson from The Young
  Ones is in it – yet so unrecognisable that I still don’t know he’s in it.
  Alien: Earth adds freshness to the franchise’s convoluted lore – give it your
  eyeballs. Tasting notes include Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Westworld, Un
  Chien Andalou, plus The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. There’s also the most
  cinematic monster to ever do it, doing it plenty. If that isn’t entertainment
  enough, then you truly are unknowable.
