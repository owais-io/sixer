  Under mounting US pressure, Lebanon’s government is being forced into a
  dangerous choice. Does it want to fight a war with Israel or does it want to
  fight a war at home, with Hezbollah? In recent weeks, the US has been pushing
  for the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah. The government had already
  been moving in that direction, but not at the pace the US wanted. Lebanese
  media began to fill with warnings from unnamed sources that if Hezbollah’s
  arms were not confiscated soon, a second war with Israel could be on the
  horizon. On Tuesday, the Lebanese government acquiesced and announced the
  Lebanese army would draw up a plan to place arms exclusively within the hands
  of the state by year’s end. Hezbollah and its political ally Amal announced
  the next day that they would “treat the decision as if it did not exist” and
  accused the government of serving US diktats. US pressure for faster
  disarmament has laid the seeds for a scenario the Lebanese government has
  taken pains to avoid: a confrontation with Hezbollah. If cornered, the group
  could resort to force to defend its arsenal. Lebanon’s current government was
  born after the latest Hezbollah-Israel war, with the US as its midwife. A
  battered Hezbollah could no longer maintain its side of a stalemate that had
  left Lebanon without a president for two years, and Joseph Aoun, the former
  army chief, was elected amid heavy US pressure. The election of Aoun, who
  included in his mandate restoring the state’s monopoly on violence, was an
  extraordinary sign of how much Lebanon, and the region, had changed in the
  past year. Hezbollah had dominated Lebanon for two decades. What had started
  as a resistance group described as a “state within a state” had transformed
  into a party controlling the state, setting much of Lebanon’s domestic and
  foreign policy. It was only after a devastating war with Israel, which saw
  virtually all of its top leadership killed, thousands of fighters dead or
  wounded and a large portion of its weapons destroyed, that Hezbollah’s grip on
  the country was loosened. The toppling of the Syrian president, Bashar
  al-Assad, in December was another blow to the group, which had used Syria as
  its main supply route from Iran. The new Lebanese government, however, was
  careful not to gloat. It took pains not to publish videos of soldiers
  confiscating Hezbollah weapons caches in south Lebanon. Too aggressive an
  approach to Hezbollah could provoke a confrontation and alienate the group’s
  base of mostly Shia Muslims. First and foremost was to engage in
  state-building so that former members of Hezbollah and its popular base felt
  included in Lebanon’s national project, rather than under siege. Officials
  were aware that the same conditions which gave rise to Hezbollah in the 1980s
  are still present today. Similar to 45 years ago, Israel occupies parts of
  southern Lebanon and the country’s Shia population, which bore the brunt of
  Lebanon’s war, are impoverished and do not feel represented by the state. The
  US views the gradual pace that the state has set as stalling, however. On the
  Lebanese side, officials have privately complained that the Americans seem
  unconcerned with building a strong Lebanese state. Instead, the US wanted
  immediate results on disarmament, putting the new government’s state-building
  project at risk. “This process is very dangerous the way it is unfolding. It
  will actually consolidate and push potentially even wider sectors of the Shia
  portion of Lebanese society behind Amal and Hezbollah rather than to national
  consolidation,” said Joseph Daher, the author of Hezbollah: the Political
  Economy of the Party of God. Near-daily Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, in
  violation of the November ceasefire, have also undermined the Lebanese
  government’s claims that only the state can protect sovereignty. The day after
  Lebanon announced it would draft a plan to disarm Hezbollah, an 11-year-old
  child was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon. The Lebanese army has not
  responded to any of the thousands of Israeli airstrikes on the country since
  November – nor does anyone expect it to. The under-equipped, under-staffed
  army can do little in the face of an Israeli military equipped with US fighter
  jets, which drop the latest US munitions by the thousand. There is little
  appetite among the international community to help the Lebanese army become a
  proper fighting force. Requests by army leadership to install low-tech
  watchtowers on its border with Israel have been rejected. Without the means to
  do so, asking the Lebanese army to enforce the disarmament of Hezbollah is a
  tall order. “How can you ask the LAF to do to Hezbollah what Israel couldn’t
  do to Hamas in a smaller space, with warplanes?” said a senior diplomat in
  Beirut. Nonetheless, international pressure to disarm Hezbollah is likely to
  increase, not abate. Opinion among international powers on the question of the
  Lebanese state’s monopoly on arms was uniform. “The US, Saudi and EU are in
  agreement on this point: the question is no longer if Hezbollah should be
  disarmed, but how to do it,” the diplomat said.
