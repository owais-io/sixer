  Guyana’s president, Irfaan Ali, has proclaimed victory in this week’s general
  and regional elections after his party won more than 240,000 votes and seven
  of the country’s ten electoral districts. “The results are all out there, as
  published by the Guyana elections commission. The numbers are clear. The
  people have spoken in an overwhelming way. We have won these elections with a
  remarkable margin,” he told the Guardian on Wednesday. Tasked with turning the
  South American nation’s newfound oil riches into prosperity while navigating
  tensions with neighbouring Venezuela, Ali faces the uphill challenge of
  reconstructing a country with the highest proven crude oil reserves per capita
  but one of the highest poverty levels in Latin America. According to a 2024
  report by the Inter-American Development Bank, 58% of Guyanese live in poverty
  despite an oil boom that has quadrupled the state budget since production
  began in 2019. Official final results of Monday’s vote have not yet been
  published and some parties have called for a recount in some electoral
  districts, but preliminary numbers show a shake-up for the South American
  country’s opposition. The upstart, We Invest in Nationhood (Win) party, which
  was founded just three months ago by business magnate Azruddin Mohamed, is
  currently second in terms of votes. With more than 109,000 votes, one district
  and the possibility of another, Win is set to dethrone the longstanding A
  Partnership for National Unity (APNU) as the country’s main opposition. At the
  latest tally, APNU, which was in power before Ali took office in 2020, had
  just under 78,000 votes. Amanzia Walton-Desir, who stood in the presidential
  race, lamented that Guyanese are still poor despite “wealth coming into this
  country like we’ve never had.” She argued that government spending on
  infrastructure and social subsidies were contributing to inflation. Ali’s
  party, the People’s Progressive Party/ Civic (PPP/C) will win the most votes
  in Region Four, the country’s largest electoral district and one that the
  party has never won since Guyana’s independence in 1966. However, it fell
  short of a complete majority and will need the backing of one of the smaller
  parties to govern the region. Voting to choose 65 members of parliament and a
  government followed months of campaigning focused on how riches from the
  country’s hydrocarbon boom should be spent. The country of about 800,000
  people has earned $7.5bn in revenue from oil sales and royalties since
  ExxonMobil started pumping offshore oil in late 2019, making Guyana one of the
  world’s fastest-growing economies. “We have delivered everything we set out to
  do over the last five years and that is why they trust us with our vision and
  agenda for the next five years,” Ali told the Guardian. His government has
  channelled oil revenue into building roads, schools and hospitals, and made
  studying at state university free. The International Monetary Fund has listed
  the country’s GDP at almost US$26bn, nearly five times what it was five years
  ago. But opposition parties have decried what they say is unfair distribution
  of oil earnings to groups connected to the ruling PPP/C. The PPP/C denies
  these allegations. Win came into the race as a wildcard, but benefited from
  Mohamed’s strong social media following. Mohamed, a member of one of Guyana’s
  wealthiest families, was sanctioned alongside his father by the US over
  allegations they defrauded Guyana’s government of tax revenue and bribed
  public officials. The Mohameds have denied all wrongdoing. Election observers
  from the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a bloc of 15 countries, the
  Commonwealth, the European Union and the Carter Centre commended the peaceful
  environment before and during the polls. However, they raised concerns about
  the mistrust and lack of clarity over the official list of people who qualify
  to vote, with the Caricom statement referring to the “perceived ‘bloated’
  nature of the voters list”. In a statement on behalf of the Commonwealth
  observer group, chairperson, Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, expressed
  concerns about the “very limited implementation of the recommendations of
  observer groups over the years”. Much of the crude reserves are in a region
  that makes up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory but is also claimed by
  once-rich petrostate Venezuela. A territorial dispute between the neighbours
  has intensified since ExxonMobil discovered the massive offshore oil deposits
  a decade ago. The region has been administered by Guyana for over 100 years.
