  Book Week is in full swing, marking it’s 80th year celebrating all things
  reading and literacy for Australia’s schoolchildren. The theme for the week,
  which runs from Saturday 16 to Saturday 23 August, is “Book an Adventure”,
  encouraging children to explore new worlds through stories. The highlight of
  Book Week for many kids is the chance to dress up as their most beloved
  characters, bringing them to life from the pages of a favourite book and into
  a costume parade. This year, Guardian Australia would love to see photos of
  your children’s weirdest, whackiest and most wonderful costumes. Please submit
  photos where only your own children are visible. If you’re having trouble
