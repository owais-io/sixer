  An American “hitwoman” who attempted to murder a business owner before going
  on the run in Armenia has been jailed for 30 years at Birmingham crown court.
  Earlier this month, Aimee Betro, 45, from Wisconsin was found guilty of
  conspiracy to murder, possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of
  violence and an offence relating to the importation of ammunition into the UK,
  after a three-week trial. During the murder attempt, Betro had disguised
  herself by dressing in a niqab, a face covering worn by some Muslim women, to
  hide her identity as she tried to shoot dead Sikander Ali outside his east
  Birmingham home in September 2019. She fired the gun at point-blank range as
  her victim arrived home in his car to the cul-de-sac where he lived in South
  Yardley, but the weapon jammed or malfunctioned, and he managed to speed away
  unharmed. Betro then returned hours later and fired three bullets through the
  bedroom windows of the family home, but again, no one was hurt. Betro’s murder
  attempt was part of a revenge plot arranged by father and son Mohammed Aslam
  and Mohammed Nazir from Derbyshire, after a long-running dispute the men had
  with Ali’s father, Aslat Mahumad. In July 2018, Nazir and Aslam were injured
  during disorder at Mahumad’s clothing boutique in Birmingham, which led them
  to conspire to have someone kill him or a member of his family. In November
  2024 the pair, who had denied any wrongdoing, were convicted after a trial.
  Nazir was sentenced to 32 years for offences including conspiracy to murder,
  while his father, Aslam, was sentenced to 10 years. Betro was recruited by her
  long-distance boyfriend Nazir, who she had met online on a dating app, and
  flew to the UK in August 2019 to carry out the planned killing in Birmingham
  the next month. Telephone evidence recovered by West Midlands police revealed
  Betro had visited Nazir in Derby in September 2019. Video footage on his
  mobile phone showed a gun being test-fired on wasteland near the A38; the
  weapon jammed during filming, as happened during the murder attempt three days
  later. Betro texted a message to the father of the man she had tried to kill,
  saying: “Stop playing hide n seek. You’re lucky it jammed. Who is it? Your
  family or you? Pick one.” Hours after her failed murder attempt, Betro fled
  the country, first to the US, and then to Armenia, from where she was
  eventually extradited to face trial. In a separate foiled plot, Betro sent
  illegal ammunition from the US to a man in Derbyshire, another rival of
  Nazir’s, so that he would be arrested. Betro showed no emotion as Judge Simon
  Drew KC sentenced her to 30 years in prison, with concurrent sentences of six
  years for possessing a firearm and two years for fraudulently evading the
  prohibition on importing ammunition. He said: “You went beyond simply reaching
  an agreement to kill and, in reality, you did intend to kill Mr Ali. It is
  only a matter of chance that Mr Ali wasn’t killed. “You were engaged in a
  complex, well planned conspiracy to murder. You were prepared to pull the
  trigger and did so on two separate occasions.” “So far as you are concerned,
  clearly you had a leading role. I accept that Nazir recruited you, but you
  were the gunwoman,” the judge added. “You were the person who was prepared to
  fire the gun, as a result you showed that you were willing to carry out the
  killing yourself.” Addressing Betro, Drew said: “So far as mitigation is
  concerned, I take into account your antecedent history, your age, the fact
  that you will serve some or all of your sentence in a UK prison, far away from
  home, and the contents of your letter in which you express remorse for your
  actions.”
