  Alex on Zoe What were you hoping for? At best, to meet my future wife. At
  worst, free food and a fun story. First impressions? I didn’t realise Sabrina
  Carpenter had dyed her hair brown! Zoe immediately had a warm and lovely
  energy about her, which helped ease my nerves. What did you talk about? Voice
  notes, why Normal People should be classified as a horror, and our carefully
  curated funeral playlists. Most awkward moment? Zoe had a horror run with
  public transport, so I had a few extra minutes to intensely scrutinise the
  wine list. Good table manners? Impeccable. Best thing about Zoe? She just
  radiates positivity, and I got the sense she lights up every room she enters.
  She can also deliver a killer rendition of Madonna’s Like A Prayer. Would you
  introduce Zoe to your friends? In a heartbeat. Describe Zoe in three words
  Caring, gorgeous, passionate. What do you think Zoe made of you? Well, she did
  say Eddie Redmayne should play me in a movie, so I like to think that was a
  good thing! Or maybe she was just being generous … Did you go on somewhere? We
  stayed until the restaurant closed, then went on to a pub for karaoke. And …
  did you kiss? Well, when the karaoke host informed the crowd that it was our
  first date and then got everyone to chant “kiss, kiss, kiss”, we couldn’t let
  the people down … If you could change one thing about the evening, what would
  it be? If I have to be extremely picky, it would be the option to have orange
  wine at the restaurant. Marks out of 10? 10. Would you meet again? Absolutely.
  Zoe on Alex What were you hoping for? Two words: a boyfriend. First
  impressions? Super cute. Did he lie about his age though? What’s your skincare
  regime, Alex? What did you talk about? Our hopes for the date (Alex was
  looking for an outdoorsy golden retriever girly. I was mildly alarmed, as I’m
  more of an indoor black cat kind of gal). Our dream festival headliners, his
  frat party days in Colorado, the GC (Gemma Collins). Most awkward moment? The
  whole crowd cheering “kiss kiss kiss” after our karaoke performance of the
  song from Dirty Dancing. Good table manners? Very polite, friendly to the
  staff, didn’t hog a single dish, and kept my wine glass full. Best thing about
  Alex? Total gent and a great conversationalist. Would you introduce Alex to
  your friends? Of course! Describe Alex in three words Warm, energetic,
  spontaneous. What do you think Alex made of you? He gave me 5/5 for karaoke –
  I’ve got the X factor, guys! Did you go on somewhere? A pub/drag-karaoke bar
  where Alex tried his first blackcurrant vodka soda. And … did you kiss? Yes –
  we pecked on stage after much heckling from the crowd (and queen). If you
  could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? The temperature –
  I was boiling. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? Yes, but maybe more
  as friends. Zoe and Alex ate at Fire &amp; Wine, London W1. Fancy a blind
  date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com
