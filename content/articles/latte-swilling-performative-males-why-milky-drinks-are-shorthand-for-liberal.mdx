  Another week, another somewhat fictional online buzzword to parse. This time
  it is the “performative male”, basically the idea that posturing straight men
  only read books to get laid, outlined in recent trend pieces including the New
  York Times, Vox, Teen Vogue, Hypebeast, GQ and millions of TikToks. According
  to the Times, this man “curates his aesthetic in a way that he thinks might
  render him more likable to progressive women. He is, in short, the antithesis
  of the toxic man.” Apparently these heterosexual men who read Joan Didion,
  carry tote bags and listen to Clairo are not in fact human beings who enjoy
  things but performative jerk offs who don’t really care about any of that
  girly stuff and are just trying to impress their feminine opposites. As Vox
  put it: “think Jacob Elordi when he was photographed with three different
  books on his person, or Paul Mescal publicly admiring Mitski”. Reading!
  Enjoying music by women! Perish the thought. Each piece differed slightly in
  what it defined as the key characteristics of the performative male, but they
  all shared one detail: he drinks matcha lattes. This was unsurprising. For
  three decades the latte has been the favored blog-whistle of the trend piece
  writer. It signals liberalism, femininity, gayness, pretension, gentrification
  – ideally all of the above – so reflexively that its origins as an insult are
  rarely revisited. It began in earnest in 1997, when journalist David Brooks
  writing in the Weekly Standard coined the term “latte liberal”. He was trying,
  disparagingly, to give name to the crunchy consumerist leftism of the time, in
  which organic vegetables and world music had become part of the social justice
  hamper: “You know you’re in a Latte Town when you can hop right off a bike
  path, browse in a used bookstore with shelves and shelves of tomes on Marxism
  the owner can no longer get rid of, and then drink coffee at a place with a
  punnish name that must have the word ‘Grounds’ in it, before sauntering
  through an African drum store or a feminist lingerie shop.” Brooks wanted to
  hint that leftism is a luxury only the bourgeois can afford – an idea
  encapsulated by the earlier formation of champagne socialist. But the latte
  proved a stickier, more evocative symbol, painting liberals as soft and
  effete. In 2004, lattes really entered politics, when a Republican Pac ran an
  ad accusing presidential candidate Howard Dean of being a “latte-drinking,
  sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading, body-piercing,
  Hollywood-loving left-wing freak show”. Lattes also became a byword for
  gentrification. In 2000, when the Brooklyn neighborhood Williamsburg was, the
  Times bemoaned at the time, reaching “the point of hipster saturation”, the
  final straw was “a local Italian specialty store and a working-class
  institution … advertising the arrival of the Chai latte”. In New York
  Magazine’s 2005 feature L-ification, the publication mapped out how
  gentrification was spreading further east into Brooklyn along the route of the
  L train with little latte icons, a milky glyph of whiteness by that point
  understood by everyone. Noticeably, the latte form remains permanent, even as
  the type of latte shifts. Newt Gingrich accused New York mayor Bill De Blasio
  of “small soy latte liberalism” in 2014 – emphasising that the only thing more
  girlish than drinking a big dairy milky coffee was drinking a small vegan
  milky coffee. On Drake’s 2010 song Thank Me Now, when he’s asking the woman
  he’s left behind if she still thinks of him, he croons: “But do I ever come up
  in discussion / Over double-pump lattes and low-fat muffins?” Now the
  performative male has once again given rise to the idea that there is
  something inherently disingenuous about a milky beverage. Interestingly as the
  latte has changed colour, from white to green, the stereotype has expanded
  beyond the white liberal: matcha hails a diverse new generation of milky boys.
  The idea of the performative male started out mostly as a joke on TikTok,
  where knowing posters would show a man reading at the gym, for example, and
  joke that he was pretending. Contests in which men meet in parks to compete to
  be the most performative have been funny, postmodern, heterosexual versions of
  drag. But with each passing write up, the knowing humorous element was been
  rinsed away, until Vox earnestly announced in its piece that the “MeToo
  movement showed us that even supposed ‘nice guy’ could be capable of alleged
  manipulation and abuse – that in fact, they could use their enlightenment as a
  kind of shield”. If you see a man with a matcha latte, you need to run! None
  of the pieces massively wanted to reckon with the fact that, as Judith Butler
  put it, “gender identity is a performative accomplishment” to begin with, or
  that Arthur Schopenhauer was complaining in the mid-19th-century that a
  performative reader “usually confuses the purchase of books with the
  acquisition of their contents”. Do we read in order to get laid? Only since
  forever. Ironically much of this ribbing comes from the same people who decry
  a crisis of masculinity, and worry for future generations of boys who feel
  like they lack purpose and companionship. Yet in the world of the performative
  male, even having female friends and drinking milky coffee is a divergence
  from true masculinity. Why is the latte such an enduring emblem for this
  distrust – a way to call men you do not like effeminate? Partly it is the
  allegory of milk, the pursed mouth of a graphic designer on a coffee cup as a
  surrogate for the Madonna del Latte, the thousands of middle ages depictions
  of Jesus nursing at Mary’s breast. Grown men drinking milk has always been
  laden in symbolism, the blend of nurture and eroticism evocative of a sexual
  infantalization. It is why so many films from A Clockwork Orange to Babygirl
  centre milk as a poison beyond a place of regular intoxication. When Kelis
  sings that her milkshake brings her boys to the yard, the lyric is so heavy in
  implication that the exact innuendo she is reaching for is irrelevant. Even
  the ancient Greeks used to have their own version of the latte joke,
  belittling the Persians that drank milk: Aristotle said Empedocles described
  it as “whitish pus”. But the milk in the context of the latte also turns
  coffee, a drink which was sold as fuel, bitter black stuff for TV detectives
  and the working man, into a sweet little treat. A latte fundamentally dilutes
  the taste of coffee and so it is easy to present those who drink it as
  watering down their wine. Even though the iconography of the latte liberal is
  now so strong it has stretched to drinks that do not contain any coffee to
  begin with. According to the performative male trend pieces, drinking a matcha
  latte indicates to women that you are soft, feminist-leaning and worldly
  (after all, it’s from Japan). Even though the latte is supposed to be this
  bastion of girlishness, women are not exempt for being chastised for drinking
  them, although the latte trope for them is more often a reflection of being
  superficial than performatively feminine. The logic of this makes little
  sense: latte liberal men are supposedly too European to be masculine, yet iced
  latte girlies are gormless Americans sucking on the straw of consumerism. No
  matter, the two sit side by side, one clutching a hot cup of simp soup, the
  other a pumpkin-spiced lobotomy. They are a pair one can project all their
  prejudices towards, without having to interrogate any of it too much. The
  irony is that hipsters and gentrifiers in coastal towns are rarely drinking
  lattes these days. They are much more likely to be sipping on a single origin
  V60 that’s been carefully weighed out on a digital scale. Indeed the
  stereotype could easily be flipped around – that it’s red states where
  complicated online Starbucks orders and Stanley cups filled with 32oz of latte
  abound. In the best survey of the coffee Americans actually drink and how it
  aligns with their politics by Diana C Mutz and Jahnavi S Rao, the differences
  were negligible. Although it is true that liberals do prefer lattes over
  conservatives (16% v 9%), the same research found liberals also prefer the
  more masculine-coded espressos over conservatives by a much bigger margin, and
  the vast majority of Americans prefer brewed coffee. But the milky latte
  stereotype persists because it is creamy and white (or green) and vaguely
  Italian. When GQ is asking “Are Matcha Men the new Soy Boys” you have got to
  wonder if gendering beverages has become the most performative act of all.
