  The US Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday it would
  terminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, questioning the safety
  of a technology credited with helping end the Covid pandemic and saving
  millions of lives. The unit, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
  Authority, helps companies develop medical supplies to address public health
  threats, and had provided billions of dollars for development of vaccines
  during the Covid-19 pandemic. HHS said the wind-down includes cancellation of
  a contract awarded to Moderna for the late-stage development of its bird flu
  vaccine for humans and the right to purchase the shots, as previously reported
  in May. The US health agency said it was also rejecting or canceling multiple
  pre-award solicitations, including proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL
  Seqirus, Gritstone and others. In total, the affected projects are worth
  “nearly $500 million”, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said.
  Certain late-stage projects were excluded from the move “to preserve prior
  taxpayer investment”. This is the latest development under US health secretary
  Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has been making sweeping
  changes to reshape vaccines, food and medicine policies. “We reviewed the
  science, listened to the experts, and acted,” Kennedy said in a statement.
  Kennedy said the HHS is terminating these programs because data show these
  vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections
  like COVID and flu”, but did not offer scientific evidence. “We’re shifting
  that funding toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective
  even as viruses mutate,” Kennedy said. The controversial announcement came as
  Covid is currently on the rise again in the US and children will soon be
  returning to school from the summer break, while many Americans will be
  planning to seek fall booster shots for annual updated protection against
  Covid. The risks of a fresh Covid wave are compounded by new vaccine
  restrictions from the Trump administration. “If you’re vaccinated against
  Covid-19, you’re less likely to get infected,” Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at
  Johns Hopkins University, said, before the latest announcement from the health
  secretary on Tuesday evening. Take-up of Covid boosters has already been
  relatively low. “We haven’t gotten a lot of people vaccinated for the past few
  years, and with the current recommendations changing, it’s even less likely,”
  Pekosz said. HHS on Tuesday said the latest decision follows a comprehensive
  review of mRNA-related investments initiated during the Covid-19 public health
  emergency. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician who directs the Center for Vaccine
  Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, criticized the HHS announcement on
  Tuesday. It will “promote their pseudoscience agenda and weaken our nation’s
  biosecurity”, he said to CNN. “The mRNA technology, like all biotechnologies,
  has strengths and weaknesses, but for a pandemic situation with a new and
  previously unknown pathogen, or for cancer vaccines and immunotherapeutics it
  has distinct advantages. HHS under Mr Kennedy is telling us that we should no
  longer look to the federal government for innovation in biomedicine. The
  states are on their own,” he added. Since taking office, Kennedy, who spent
  two decades sowing misinformation around immunization, has overseen a major
  overhaul of US health policy – firing, for example, a panel of vaccine experts
  that advise the government and replacing them with his own appointees. In its
  first meeting, the new panel promptly voted to ban a longstanding vaccine
  preservative targeted by the anti-vaccine movement, despite its strong safety
  record. He has also ordered a sweeping new study on the long-debunked link
  between vaccines and autism. Unlike traditional vaccines, which often use
  weakened or inactivated forms of the target virus or bacteria, mRNA shots
  deliver genetic instructions into the host’s cells, prompting them to produce
  a harmless decoy of the pathogen and train the immune system to fight the real
  thing. Though in development for decades, mRNA vaccines were propelled from
  lab benches to widespread use through Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed – a
  public-private partnership led by Barda that poured billions into companies to
  accelerate development. The technology’s pioneers, Katalin Karikó and Drew
  Weissman, were awarded the 2023 Nobel prize in medicine for their work
  contributing “to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of
  the greatest threats to human health in modern times” The Associated Press and
  Reuters contributed reporting
