  The niece of a Kenyan woman who was murdered more than a decade ago, allegedly
  by British soldiers, has said her family now believe the defence secretary
  “just made a promise for his political gain” when he met them in April. John
  Healey told the family of Agnes Wanjiru of his “determination to see a
  resolution” in the case of her murder, pledging the UK’s full support for the
  investigation. But now, almost four months later, Wanjiru’s family say they
  have been left disappointed, having seen no further progress in their fight
  for justice. Wanjiru, then 21, disappeared in March 2012, after last being
  seen drinking with British soldiers at a bar in the Lion’s Court hotel in
  Nanyuki, a town in the east of Kenya, where the army has a military base,
  BATUK. Her family spent two months looking for her, until her body was found
  stuffed into a septic tank in the grounds of the hotel. She had been stabbed
  several times. Six years ago, an inquest in Kenya found that Wanjiru, who was
  mother to a then baby girl, had been killed by one or more British soldiers.
  In 2021, several soldiers, who at the time were attached to the Duke of
  Lancaster’s regiment, came forward to name a suspect. One offered startling
  testimony in which he claimed the suspect, a fellow Duke of Lancaster soldier,
  had confessed to her murder on the night, and taken him to see Wanjiru’s body
  in the septic tank. While a British soldier is believed to be the primary
  suspect in the case, under the UK-Kenya defence cooperation agreement,
  jurisdiction for investigating the murder lies with the Kenyan authorities.
  Kenyan police have flown to the UK several times, and are believed to have
  questioned multiple witnesses. In April, Kenyan police said a file had been
  passed to the Kenyan director of public prosecutions for a charging decision.
  Yet almost four years on from a suspect being identified, nobody has been
  arrested or charged in relation to the murder. Wanjiru’s niece Esther Njoki,
  21, was eight years old in 2012, and said her memories of her aunt drove her
  fight for justice. “The reason why I’m passionate about this case and that
  I’ve been fighting, it’s what she did in the family,” she said. “She used to
  take care of me when my mum was not there. She used to cook, braid my hair,
  everything. So that’s why I’m so passionate to fight for her rights.” “She was
  always jovial, smiling, hard-working. We were always laughing because of her
  jokes and everything,” she added. “It’s very heartbreaking. She was kind, she
  was everything, we miss her.” While in opposition, Healey called for more to
  be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”, but Njoki says they are
  disappointed that more has not been done in the year since Labour came to
  power. “I think he just made a promise for his political gain,” Njoki said, “I
  think he’s taking us for a ride.” “They hide behind investigation,” she added,
  “because every time we raise any issue, they say ‘investigation,
  investigation’, we don’t know the status of the investigation.” Njoki, who is
  studying communications and acts as a spokesperson for the family, is
  currently raising funds to come to the UK in the autumn in order to meet with
  campaigners, hold a press conference, and lobby politicians directly. “I want
  to come and lobby there, so that they can take this matter seriously,” she
  said, “because they know the family can’t come to UK to seek justice there.”
  Justice, Njoki said, would mean closure. Her family believed that the
  government could do more. “They have power, but they have refused, and it’s
  heartbreaking,” she said. “Agnes was a human being.” “I think if she were
  around right now, everything would be so perfect,” she added, “but now that
  she’s not there, we are left to seek justice for her, with our hearts broken,
  being frustrated, and it’s the worst thing.” Tessa Gregory, a partner at the
  law firm Leigh Day, who is acting on behalf of the family, said: “It is now 13
  years since Agnes’ body was found in a septic tank, the Kenyan criminal
  investigation has been ongoing for years, and while the file was reportedly
  sent to the [Kenyan] DPP months ago, a charging decision is still awaited. The
  family are frustrated with both the lack of progress in the criminal
  proceedings and the lack of engagement from the British government.” She
  added: “They hope that the secretary of state will do everything within his
  power to ensure that those held responsible are brought to account swiftly and
  that the role of the British army in Agnes’ death, including as to why nothing
  was done for nearly a decade after the murder, is thoroughly and independently
  examined.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “Our thoughts
  remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru, and the defence secretary has long
  recognised the tragic circumstances of her death. “The jurisdiction for this
  investigation lies with the Kenyan authorities. The defence secretary welcomed
  the confirmation that the case file had been handed over to the director of
  public prosecutions for a charging decision during his visit to Kenya in April
  2025. “We will continue to work closely with the Kenyan authorities for the
  justice the family deserves. In order to protect the integrity of the Kenyan
  investigation and in the interests of justice for Agnes Wanjiru’s family, we
  are unable to comment further.”
