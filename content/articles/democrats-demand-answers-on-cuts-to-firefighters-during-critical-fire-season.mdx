  As federal firefighters grapple with strained resources in an intense year of
  fire activity, Democratic lawmakers are demanding answers from the Trump
  administration about how severe cuts to staffing and budgets at the US Forest
  Service may have hamstrung wildfire preparation and response. Leaders at the
  agency and the US Department of Agriculture, which oversees it, have
  repeatedly assured the public and Congress that they were fully prepared for
  the critical fire season that’s already well under way. But internal data,
  first reported by the Guardian last month, painted a dangerously different
  picture, with more than a quarter of firefighting roles left unfilled in
  mid-July, just as fire activity and risks spiked. Trump administration
  policies designed to rapidly shrink the federal government have also left
  significant gaps in the workforce that supports wildfire mitigation and
  suppression. In a letter issued Thursday, the representative Robert Garcia,
  the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, gave USDA secretary Brooke
  Rollins two weeks to provide documents with a detailed accounting of
  firefighter staffing and support personnel, and called for clarity from the
  USFS on information that’s largely been shielded from the public. “The Forest
  Service’s firefighting capacity has been dangerously hampered by Department of
  Government Efficiency and Trump Administration layoffs, deferred resignations,
  and other early retirements and resignations just as climate change is
  extending the fire season,” Garcia wrote in the letter, requesting specifics
  that would show “the extent to which the Trump Administration’s policies have
  affected the ability of firefighters to protect the American public”. Staffing
  reports produced on 17 July showed that more than 5,100 positions at USFS were
  unfilled, more than 26% of positions. The issue was especially grim in the
  Pacific north-west, a region facing extremely high fire risk this year, with a
  vacancy rate of 39%. The intermountain region, the largest region with close
  to 34m acres (14m hectares) of forestlands that stretch across parts of Utah,
  Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho and California, has nearly 37% of jobs unfilled. Weeks
  before the reports, Tom Schultz, the chief of the USFS, told senators the
  agency was reaching its firefighting capacity and had hit 99% of hiring goals.
  The staffing numbers fail to capture the strain being felt in specific areas
  within these regions where ranks are severely thin. There are reports of USFS
  crews staffed with less than half of the positions once considered necessary
  to be fully operational. Six federal firefighters, who asked for anonymity
  because they are barred from speaking publicly, described in July how the
  staffing shortages had complicated crews’ ability to suppress large fires and
  contribute to increased injuries and risks for firefighters on the ground.
  “There is definitely a lot of tension in the system this season,” said a fire
  captain, describing how these issues have long plagued the agency. “It’s sort
  of like that medieval torture device that stretched people – just one more
  crank.” That captain speculated that the agency might be exploiting the
  difference between “minimum” staffing requirements and what was traditionally
  considered “fully staffed”. “You can technically play a football game with 11
  people on the team,” he said. “It would be considered negligent, maybe even
  abusive to the players, but they signed up to play and it’s technically
  allowed.” Along with reports of dangerous holes left on firefighting teams,
  there have been deep cuts to support staff that have negatively affected crews
  on the fire line. USFS hasn’t disclosed specific numbers and it remains
  unclear exactly how many employees have been pushed out of the agency this
  year, either through firings or programs incentivizing resignation and early
  retirement, but estimates shared by the US senator Patty Murray go up to 7,500
  people. Among them were 1,400 people with so-called “red cards”,
  non-professional firefighters who trained to join operations on the fire line
  if needed. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees the forest service,
  has tried to address the loss of employees with fire qualifications by calling
  for those with red cards who took early resignation or retiring offers to
  voluntarily return for the season and take on fire assignments until their
  contracts end. By 21 July, 65 had returned and been mobilized, according to a
  USDA spokesperson. This year, there have already been reports of crews being
  left without power for weeks due to cut maintenance workers, paychecks being
  late or halved because administrative roles were left empty, or firefighters
  having to mow lawns outside their offices, manage campsites and do plumbing
  work at their barracks in addition to their other duties. In Oregon,
  firefighters reportedly went hungry after their 16-hour shifts and ran low on
  medical supplies as a result of the staffing challenges. “Lost staff include
  administrative and human resources personnel, food service and sanitation
  workers, scientists, foresters, meteorologists, and others with deep
  institutional knowledge that help firefighters do their jobs,” Garcia wrote in
  the letter. “These staffing cuts and vacancies have firefighters covering
  tasks, such as answering phones and cleaning toilets, rather than fighting
  fires.” While Schulz has publicly said USFS is adequately staffed, he
  acknowledged the challenges in an internal memo sent to agency leadership in
  July, shared with the Guardian. “As expected, the 2025 fire year is proving to
  be extremely challenging,” he wrote. Forecasts issued from the Climate
  Prediction Center and Predictive Services indicate the season is far from
  slowing. Higher-than-normal temperatures are predicted for much of the US
  through September, along with drier-than-normal conditions, creating high
  risks for big burns. “We have reached a critical point in our national
  response efforts and we must make every resource available,” Schultz added.
  “At times like this we know the demand for resources outpaces their
  availability.” With his request, Garcia is hoping to find out exactly how the
  agency is calculating its numbers and where gaps may still exist. Lawmakers
  are asking Rollins to provide “a detailed and comprehensive accounting of
  current staffing and staffing changes at the Forest Service including
  firefighting jobs and individuals with red cards, as well as administrative
  personnel, support staff, and other positions which contribute to disaster
  preparedness and firefighting, organized by region, since January 20, 2025”.
  They’re also requesting documents and communications pertaining to the
  administration’s firings and the programs that pushed thousands of staffers to
  resign or retire. In May, Rollins directed the USFS chief to provide an
  analysis on how the voluntary departures affected firefighting and fire
  support, along with a plan to “remedy critical vacancies”, but those numbers
  and strategies were never made public. Garcia has officially requested
  documentation and communications on this memo as well. Garcia represents parts
  of Los Angeles, the city hit by a disastrous and deadly firestorm in January
  that left neighborhoods leveled and killed 31 people. “Our federal wildland
  firefighters are on the frontlines of our battle against natural disasters,
  yet the Trump Administration continues to slash essential personnel, even as
  we face longer and ever more dangerous wildfire seasons,” Garcia said in a
  statement to the Guardian. “The Department of Agriculture owes the American
  people answers on why the agency is understaffed and how they plan to
  safeguard communities nationwide, especially as millions of acres continue to
  burn across the country.”
