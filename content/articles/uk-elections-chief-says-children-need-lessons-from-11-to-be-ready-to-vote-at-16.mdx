  Schools will need to give democracy lessons to children from the age of 11 and
  ask teachers to leave their politics at the classroom door to help prepare for
  votes at 16, the head of the UK elections watchdog has said. Vijay Rangarajan,
  the chief executive of the Electoral Commission, said democratic education
  would be rolled out at first to those aged over 14 in preparation for votes at
  16 at the next election. However, he said this would ultimately need to start
  at age 11 in order for pupils to be in the best position to take advantage of
  being able to vote at 16 and 17. The Electoral Commission is preparing
  material to give to schools to help with democratic education, amid calls from
  some politicians, such as David Blunkett, for better preparation. In an
  interview with the Guardian, Rangarajan said huge work was going into the
  citizenship material to make it “impartial”, and said schools and teachers
  have a role in making sure they do not attempt to sway students in how to
  vote. “We’re going to need teachers to be really good at leaving their own
  personal views a bit at the door here,” he said. “And making clear, when they
  have got personal views, it’s just personal views.” Nigel Farage, the leader
  of Reform, has complained he sees the education system as being “full of
  leftwing prejudice” and “anti-Reform bias”. Rangarajan said teachers “will
  need really good materials and some guidance on how you can teach this stuff
  well” with debates about engaging political issues, as well as the mechanics
  of how the system works. “I can see that quite a few political parties have
  concerns about partiality, so we’re spending a lot of time on how we make sure
  the material is really impartial,” he said. A poll of 6,000 teachers by
  Teacher Tapp found that more than 80% do not think the national curriculum
  currently prepares children enough to be able to vote at age 16, while about
  half of 16- and 17-year-olds have said they do not feel adequately well
  informed to be given the vote. Rangarajan, a former ambassador to Brazil, who
  has been leading the regulator for just over a year, said one of the big
  lessons from the Scottish move to give 16-year-olds the vote in the
  independence referendum and in local and Holyrood elections was that schools
  needed to be on board with education about democracy. “The main lesson that we
  took was it was extremely patchy in schools in Scotland, so that’s why we’re
  working on the education stuff really early on,” he said. “A lot of teachers
  said ‘We don’t want to engage’ in the run-up to the Scottish referendum, which
  was really quite sensitive. So teachers need some support.” He said providing
  material nationally as an elections watchdog meant that teachers could “blame
  us if parents don’t always like it” but it was essential to get good levels of
  engagement among young people. The elections chief also said it was crucial to
  get young people thinking how to evaluate online material critically and tell
  what is misinformation. The evidence is mixed on whether lowering the voting
  age for elections in Scotland and Wales has increased democratic
  participation, but there is emerging data suggesting that voting habits are
  more likely to stick if they are formed early. Rangarajan spoke to the
  Guardian after the government unveiled its election reform package to tighten
  the rules on political funding, crack down on abuse of candidates, increase
  fines for breaking the rules and move towards more automatic registration of
  voters. He said the Electoral Commission had been calling for the closure of
  some of the loopholes to stop foreign money entering politics since 2013, so
  it was important to see the government bringing in changes to restore voter
  trust to the system. However, he called for further action on bringing back
  the independence of the Electoral Commission, after Boris Johnson put it under
  government oversight for the first time by giving ministers the right to set
  its policy objectives. “The point of principle is a government depends on an
  election to get re-elected,” he said. “And it shouldn’t be able to instruct
  the people who are trying to referee that re-election.” The government has so
  far resisted overturning Johnson’s changes, but peers could push for the
  Electoral Commission to become fully independent again when the promised
  elections legislation gets to the House of Lords. He also said there was more
  work to do on protecting especially female candidates from deepfake porn, and
  looking at whether more needs to be done to strengthen the rules around
  donations to political crowdfunders by cryptocurrency. He said the biggest
  worry currently, in terms of defending democracy, was about abuse putting
  people off wanting to be politicians, particularly women and ethnic minority
  candidates. “It’s very gendered,” he said. “We’re getting into the realms of
  some of the deepfake porn and so on that we’re seeing being used as a direct
  tool against women candidates quite a lot.” A speaker’s conference is
  examining the issue, with the Electoral Commission taking part in Scottish
  pilots that involve centralised units of police, electoral officials and IT
  experts working together to track down those involved in generating abusive
  material. Despite a push from some ministers for a ban on cryptocurrency
  donations, which can be difficult to trace, Rangarajan said he did not think
  that was necessary as there was already a huge responsibility on parties to be
  sure they knew the source of their donations. “Parties get given far more
  weird things than crypto,” he said, pointing to donations of artworks, foreign
  trips or the use of yachts, which can be harder to quantify.
