  Your report is interesting but not surprising (Half of arrests at Palestine
  Action ban protest were 60 or over, data shows, 10 August). I felt able to
  take part in the protest, and get arrested, because I am retired, and so don’t
  have job prospects which would be put at risk through a criminal record. The
  system whereby any criminal conviction, however ethically motivated, puts a
  person’s entire career at risk holds many people back from taking nonviolent
  direct action for peace and justice. It’s a major factor in propping up the
  military-industrial complex that causes so much devastation. Dr Bob Banks
  Grindleford, Derbyshire • The justice minister, Alex Davies-Jones, said she
  wanted to thank the police for “their bravery and courage in carrying out
  their diligent duties” with regard to the arrests at the weekend’s
  demonstrations. I recognise the value of our police forces, but cannot see
  much courage or bravery in arresting peaceful 70-year-old ladies. Nick
  Hopkinson Tockwith, North Yorkshire • With the average age of criminality
  rapidly rising as a result of Palestine Action arrests, will new profiling
  mean that I am likely to be stopped and searched in the near future? Tom Brown
  (74) Gore End, Hampshire • Were I to pray for Palestine Action, would that
  count as “support”? Martin Grundy Newcastle upon Tyne • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
