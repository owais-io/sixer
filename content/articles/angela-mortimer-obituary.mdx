  Angela Mortimer, who has died aged 93, was one of only four British players to
  have won Wimbledon since the second world war. The odds on this shy young
  woman emerging from the backwaters of Devon to succeed on the international
  sporting stage were as remote as the swathes of Dartmoor she used to roam as a
  child. But, having survived trying to dig up an unexploded bomb she found on
  the moor as an eight-year-old, “Mort” as she became known in the tennis world,
  battled all manner of adversity until she was able to beat Christine Truman in
  the Wimbledon final of 1961. On that rainy day, lady luck finally rode with
  this doggedly persistent performer as she fought back from a set and a break
  down against Truman after her teenage opponent had taken a heavy fall when
  leading 6-4, 4-3 and 30-40 on Mortimer’s serve. Thrown out of her lanky
  stride, Truman lost her rhythm and her more experienced opponent was able to
  close out victory 7-5 in the third set – a victory that would have seemed
  laughable when she was sent packing from Arthur Roberts’s coaching session in
  Torquay at the age of 15. Ignoring the fact that Torquay was a two-hour bus
  ride from her home in Plymouth and that Roberts had been advertising tennis
  coaching for children of 12 and under, Angela insisted on a trial. After a few
  shots, Roberts was less than impressed. “You don’t have a clue how to hit the
  ball,” he said. “You’re 15, which is too old to learn how to play tennis and
  you live miles away. Go home and forget about tennis.” Not many teenagers
  would have survived the cruelty of that assessment, but Mortimer’s mind was
  made up. She was going to become a tennis player. A year later, she went back
  to Torquay and an amazed Mr Roberts assigned her to a wall. “Hit against
  that,” he said. “You can’t do much harm there.” Eventually the tough but
  dedicated coach – who went on to help Sue Barker win the French Open – saw
  that Mortimer’s total obsession with the sport might enable her to overcome
  initial technical deficiencies and he ended up becoming her coach, mentor and
  number one supporter. There is no doubt that partial deafness worked in
  Mortimer’s favour as she pursued her single-minded ambition. Much of the
  social whirl passed her by and she was happiest following her own private
  dreams on a tennis court. Inadvertently she made enemies along the way because
  some took offence at her off-hand manner, often the simple result of not
  having heard what they said. Mortimer was born in Plymouth. Her father, John,
  worked in property while her mother, Florence (nee Beard), who liked tennis
  tea parties, looked after Angela and her older sister Jenefer. Once Angela was
  released from the wall and allowed to practise with other players at Roberts’s
  school, she progressed rapidly as a solid baseline player and was able to win
  a round at Wimbledon in 1951. Two years later she was selected for Britain’s
  Wightman Cup team against the US – the women’s equivalent of the Davis Cup in
  those days – and soon became the top ranked player in the country. It was not
  until that point that Mortimer, having been taken ill just before the British
  Hard Court Championships at Bournemouth, discovered her hearing problem. “Only
  then did I understand the reason I had been able to concentrate so intensely
  on court, shutting out every noise except the sound of the ball on the
  racket,” she said. “I had not been able to hear any other noise. For years I
  had been growing gradually deaf.” Mortimer fought that adversity in the same
  manner that she handled other setbacks, including the trip to Egypt that left
  her feeling weak for months with a stomach virus. She was still far from fit
  when she battled her way through to the final of the French Championships at
  Roland Garros in 1955. It was a suffocatingly hot day and, as the match neared
  the two-hour mark, she wondered how long she could continue. Then she heard
  the umpire call for a brandy for her opponent, the American Dorothy Knode, and
  the knowledge that her rival was suffering too spurred her on to a memorable
  2-6, 7-5, 10-8 victory. Afterwards the French Tennis Federation held a
  champagne party in her honour. But Angela was not there. Exhausted, she had
  gone to bed. By then all doubts about her ability to become a top player had
  vanished and, on her first visit to Australia in 1958, Mortimer added the
  Australian crown to her growing list of titles. When she won Wimbledon in
  1961, only 14 years had elapsed since Roberts had told her not to bother with
  tennis. A year after her ultimate triumph she retired from full-time
  competition and, in 1967, married John Barrett, the former British Davis Cup
  captain, author and long-time BBC commentator at Wimbledon, thereafter using
  the name Angela Mortimer Barrett. The ultimate irony, perhaps, was that Angela
  spent the remaining years of her life living in Kingston upon Thames in total
  marital harmony with a member of the fourth estate. Partially because of her
  shyness, she had always shunned publicity and had spent the day before her
  Wimbledon final barricaded in a relative’s house, refusing to answer the pleas
  of the baying reporters camped outside. As those admitted into her confidence
  were quick to realise, Mortimer valued her friends and was deeply appreciative
  of the wide world that tennis had offered her. But, for a public figure, she
  was a very private person. She was made MBE in 1967. Mortimer is survived by
  John, and their children, Michael and Sarah Jane. • Florence Angela Margaret
