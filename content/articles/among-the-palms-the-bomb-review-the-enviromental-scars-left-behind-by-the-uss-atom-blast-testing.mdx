  Among the Palms the Bomb review – the enviromental scars left behind by the
  US’s atom-blast testing

bodyText: >-
  The culmination of a seven-year research project, Lukas Marxt and Vanja
  Smiljanić’s striking, exhaustive film examines the lasting impact of
  20th-century military projects on the US landscape. The film begins at the
  former Wendover air force base in Utah, where fighter-bomber practice runs
  were held before the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Moving
  through the corridors of a museum erected to commemorate the mission, the
  roving camera takes in various artefacts, including replicas of the two atomic
  bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man. Circulating through various monitors and
  speakers, matter-of-fact narration of these events lingers in the air, lending
  an omnipresent eeriness. Here lies empty nostalgia, unnervingly entombed. The
  ecological devastation that surrounds the Salton Sea, a testing site for the
  Manhattan Project, tells a different story. What looks like sand is, in fact,
  the crushed remains of former vegetation and aquatic life. As water levels
  rapidly recede, toxic waste piles up, with hazardous health effects for local
  residents. Most poignantly, the film reminds us that this region is, first and
  foremost, Native American land; close by is the Torres Martinez desert, where
  the Indigenous Cahuilla tribe was once nearly wiped out by a smallpox epidemic
  engineered by white settlers. Now, their descendants have formed a close
  alliance with undocumented migrant workers from south of the border, also
  victims of state violence. Testimonials from various interviewees are
  dextrously entwined with poetic shots of shifting landscapes, which range from
  closeups of environmental ruins to bird’s-eye views of arid soil. This
  interplay transforms these images into depositories of oral histories and
  lived experiences; these stories of exploitation, loss and Indigenous pain
  might not find a home in the official records, but they live on in this
  passionate documentary. • Among the Palms the Bomb is on True Story from 29
  August.
