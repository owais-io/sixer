  Victorians could soon have a legal right to work from home two days a week,
  under proposed Australian-first laws to be introduced to parliament by the
  state Labor government in 2026. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, used
  Labor’s state conference on Saturday to announce the proposal, which, if
  passed by parliament, would make the state the first in the country to
  legislate the right to work remotely. Allan told party faithful if a job can
  “reasonably” be done from home, employees would have the legal right to do so
  for at least two days a week. She said that working from home was popular, it
  saved families money, cut congestion and allowed greater workforce
  participation, particularly among women with children, carers and people with
  a disability. “This isn’t about whether the work gets done, it gets done. This
  is about power. It’s about who gets to call the shots and who gets pushed
  around,” Allan said in her speech. “We will not stand by while workers –
  especially women, single mums, carers – get punished for needing balance in
  their lives. This is about respect, this is about dignity, this is about
  fairness.” The law would apply to both public and private sector workers,
  though it is unclear how it will be enforced, given industrial relations is
  the domain of the federal government. All states except Western Australia have
  referred their powers to make laws for private sector workplaces to the
  federal government. The constitution also states that state laws that conflict
  with federal laws are considered invalid. However, Allan told reporters there
  were “several legislative options” available to the state government,
  including via the Equal Opportunity Act. She said consultation on the
  legislation would be led by the Department of Premier and Cabinet and would
  cover the types of businesses and the size of businesses that would be
  included, as well as the definition of remote work and who was able to do it.
  “We’re going to go through a consultation process to get it right here in
  Victoria, and that will flesh out more of those details, but there are
  mechanisms that we know are available to us here in Victoria,” Allan said.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email The announcement sets the stage for a
  political fight in the lead-up to the November 2026 state election, given the
  Coalition opposition has previously signalled plans to return the public
  service to the office full-time. The shadow treasurer, James Newbury, told the
  Herald Sun in February that the government “should be requiring public
  servants to work from the office” but stopped short of confirming whether the
  Coalition would enforce a mandate. The issue was also a flashpoint at the
  recent federal election, with Peter Dutton forced mid-campaign to reverse a
  policy to restrict work from home arrangements for public servants due to
  public backlash. Battin keeps door open amid business backlash The state
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, on Saturday kept the door open to supporting
  the proposal. “The Victorian Liberals and Nationals recognise that working
  from home has become a valuable option for many workers and families,” Battin
  said in a statement. “We support measures that help Victorians enjoy a better
  work-life balance, and will review any legislation closely, to ensure it
  supports flexibility, productivity and personal choice.” But it has sparked
  immediate backlash from business groups, including the Victorian Chamber of
  Commerce and Industry. It has raised “major concerns”, including that it could
  damage productivity and teamwork, exacerbate mental health issues due to
  detachment from the office, and create inequity, as only a small number of
  people would actually be able to work from home. The lobby group also said it
  could be unconstitutional, given EBAs already in place operate under federal
  jurisdiction. Its chief executive, Paul Guerra, described the change as
  “perplexing”, given the federal government’s focus on boosting productivity.
  “If Victoria moves away from the legislated national system, businesses will
  move interstate and jobs will be lost,” he said. “If we want businesses to be
  productive – and to raise the economic prospects of everyone in this state and
  this country – we need to get out of their way and let them operate in a way
  that best suits their model.” The Australian Industry group said the plan was
  “blatant political opportunism” ahead of the election. “The proposal is a
  serious government overreach that undermines business autonomy and further
  jeopardises economic confidence in the state,” their Victorian head, Tim
  Piper, said. Allan, however, said she was prepared for a “fight” with bosses
  over the proposal. “There are plenty of bosses who will fight us on this – I’m
  absolutely sure of it. Bosses who cling to outdated ways of working because
  they don’t want to give up control, bosses who think being seen at a desk is
  more important than a parent getting home for dinner with their kids,” she
  said. “They know where my government stands and if it’s a fight they want,
  they’ll get it.”
