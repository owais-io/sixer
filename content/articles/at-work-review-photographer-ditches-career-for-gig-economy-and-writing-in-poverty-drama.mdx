  At Work review – photographer ditches career for gig economy and writing in
  poverty drama
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  Valérie Donzelli has given us a strange mixture of realism and quaint naivety
  in this film, based on an autobiographical novel by French photographer turned
  novelist Franck Courtès. There are some interesting insights into the gig
  economy but some very cliched and implausible representations of what happens
  when you become a literary author. With a kind of unvarying bland placidity,
  Bastien Bouillon plays someone who (like Courtès) abandoned a very successful
  career in photography in pursuit of his financially perilous dream of being a
  serious writer. We get a single shot early on of all his cameras on a shelf:
  he presumably does not sell any to alleviate his financial difficulties but we
  never see or hear about these valuable objects ever again. Bouillon has
  already had what the French call succès d’estime with some well-reviewed but
  low-selling books, and his publisher (Virginie Ledoyen) says he needs to get
  some serious sales; she is unenthusiastic about his new manuscript and refuses
  to advance him any more money. Bouillon’s wife and kids have moved out, a
  situation he accepts with the same undemonstrative blankness as everything
  else. So he is forced to move to a cheaper place and do piecemeal labour to
  pay the bills while he works listlessly on his magnum opus; he deliberately
  chooses menial, meaningless work to ringfence the dignity of his new vocation
  as a serious author. He never quite answers the question of why he doesn’t
  just do literary-adjacent work such as teaching. Perhaps his pride will not
  permit him. So using a Taskrabbit-type website on which workers must
  humiliatingly undercut each other in bidding to do various manual-labour jobs
  for low fees, he scrapes a depressing living. But with an awful inevitability,
  he turns out to be writing a heartwarming book about what this existence is
  like, with vignettes of all these micro-employers, which is naturally entitled
  At Work. Did Courtès really submit a miscellaneous bunch of handwritten
  notebooks to his publisher for this – not typing it himself, no agent, nothing
  like that? Did he really continue to do online gig work even after it was
  published? Well, maybe: although his film deal surely means this era is at an
  end. It is a novel and a fiction feature after all, and neither are, as they
  say, on oath with the details. Either way, the film, though eventful enough,
  does not quite succeed in its tacit claim to be a study of poverty; the author
  behaves like a student who is stoically accepting some temporary dodgy
  accommodation. • At Work screened at the Venice film festival.
