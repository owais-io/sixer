  rate to 3.6%

  The Reserve Bank of Australia delivered a much-anticipated rate cut at its
  meeting on Tuesday and flagged the potential for two or three more, while
  warning of slow economic growth for the foreseeable future. The RBA’s monetary
  policy board voted unanimously to drop the official cash rate target to 3.6%,
  from 3.85%. All four major banks announced they would pass the cut on to
  customers by the end of August. Once lenders pass on the relief to their
  borrowers, the third rate cut of the year will deliver somebody with a
  $500,000 mortgage a further $74 off their monthly interest payments, according
  to Canstar, bringing the total drop to $272. Michele Bullock, the RBA
  governor, said the bank was increasingly confident in its predictions that
  unemployment would not rise and inflation would stay near the target low
  level. “That’s our best guess, and we’re looking to see that we continue on
  that path and, as we do, we can continue to lower interest rates,” she said.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It’s a nice set of forecasts … conditioned on
  a continual lowering in interest rates: a couple more, two-slash-three.” But
  tempering the welcome development for more than 3m mortgaged households was a
  downbeat new economic outlook that predicted “persistently” lower productivity
  growth than previously expected. In a statement that will further raise the
  stakes for the Albanese government ahead of Labor’s three-day economic reform
  roundtable from next Tuesday, the RBA also slashed its forecasts for
  longer-term productivity growth from 1% to 0.7%. Weaker-than expected national
  productivity flowed through to an about $30bn downgrade to economic growth
  over the coming two years, with the country’s trend economic growth rate
  lowered from 2.2-2.3% to just 2.0%. The new forecasts show lower productivity
  growth also flowing through to lower wages growth, with the RBA predicting
  average earnings per hour, after inflation, would grow by 0.7% in the year to
  June 2027, versus a previous estimate of 1%. Jim Chalmers has made finding
  ways to boost productivity a key commitment for the government’s second term,
  and the RBA estimates show Australians’ real incomes will grow more slowly
  than previously thought over coming years. Speaking at Parliament House, the
  treasurer said it was “a good day” for millions of Australians, even as he
  conceded there were longer-term challenges. “Our economy is not productive
  enough,” Chalmers said. “It’s not resilient enough in the face of all this
  international uncertainty. And we’ve made good progress on the budget as well.
  But we need to try to make it even more sustainable. And so these are the
  challenges before us.” In its Statement on Monetary Policy, the RBA said “for
  some time, our forecasts have implicitly assumed that productivity growth was
  temporarily weak and would gradually return to, and be sustained at, higher
  historical growth rates”. The central bank’s economists conceded they have
  been too optimistic about the prospect for a productivity reversal, and that
  the problems were “persistent”. “There is a risk that our new trend
  productivity assumption remains too optimistic,” the RBA said. Tuesday’s cut
  was widely expected after the bank’s surprise decision to leave interest rates
  on hold in July, with the economist Dr Brendan Rynne describing the decision
  as “better late than never”. “Another couple of cuts is required to energise
  our economy again and turn things around,” said Rynne, the chief economist at
  KPMG. Analysts at each of the major banks expect at least one more interest
  rate cut by the end of 2025, taking the cash rate to 3.35%. The RBA forecasts
  referenced by the governor indicate inflation and employment could be held
  stable with a cash rate as low as 2.9% by the end of 2026, or almost three
  further cuts.
