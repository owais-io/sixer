  congressional hearing

  Nigel Farage has been accused of being a “Putin-loving free speech impostor”
  whose main motivation is ingratiating himself with Donald Trump and tech
  companies, during a sometimes difficult appearance before a US congressional
  hearing on censorship. The Reform UK leader, who missed prime minister’s
  questions to appear as a witness before the House judiciary committee, was
  invited by its Republican leadership, who quizzed him about what Farage called
  the “awful authoritarian” situation for free speech in the UK. But he also
  faced openly hostile questioning from Democrat members, who questioned whether
  he really backed free speech, with one asking why journalists from hostile
  publications had been banned from Reform events. In an opening statement, the
  Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin said that if Farage was, as he said, worried
  about the implications of the UK’s Online Safety Act, he might have done
  better to make the case as an MP rather than in the US. “He should go and
  advance the positions he’s taking here in Congress today in parliament, which
  is meeting today, if he’s serious about it,” Raskin said. “To the people of
  the UK who think this Putin-loving free speech impostor and Trump sycophant
  will protect freedom in this country: come on over to America and see what
  Trump and Maga are doing to destroy our freedom. You might … think twice
  before you let Mr Farage make Britain great again.” Some other Democrat
  members were equally scathing. Jerrold Nadler asked why the committee had
  sought evidence from “a fringe politician from the United Kingdom”, while
  another, Hank Johnson, asked Farage to confirm that Reform currently has four
  MPs. Johnson accused Farage of advocating for free speech so as to solicit
  donations from Elon Musk, the owner of X, saying: “You’re trying to ingratiate
  yourself with the tech bros.” He added: “You need money from Elon Musk in
  order to get elected prime minister of Great Britain. That’s the bottom line.”
  Farage responded by pointing out that Musk did not support him: “Elon Musk is
  abusive about me virtually every single week, but it’s a free country.” Raskin
  asked the Reform leader why he had called for a ban on a pro-Gaza protest,
  with Farage saying this was because it would have happened close to
  Remembrance Sunday, calling this a “sensitive” time. Raskin replied: “I
  thought that’s what the freedom of speech was about. You have a right to
  engage in speech that other people consider offensive or insensitive.” Raskin
  also asked why Reform often prevented journalists from critical organisations
  from attending its events. Farage said this did not happen with his knowledge:
  “If I go back the last 25 years, I can’t think of banning anybody. But I mean,
  maybe somebody else did.” Under more sympathetic questioning from Republican
  members, Farage cited the cases of Lucy Connolly, who was jailed for sending a
  tweet urging people to “set fire” to hotels housing asylum seekers, and of
  Graham Linehan, as “a klaxon” over the threat to free speech. However, he
  denied calling for the US to place sanctions on Britain if it did not change
  its laws, saying that he only wanted American politicians and businesses to
  try to persuade the UK over this.
