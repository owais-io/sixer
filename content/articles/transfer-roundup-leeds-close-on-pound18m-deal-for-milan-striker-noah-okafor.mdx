  Leeds are poised to make their ninth signing of the summer after agreeing an
  £18m deal with Milan for the Switzerland striker Noah Okafor. The 25-year-old
  is scheduled to undergo a medical in Yorkshire on Wednesday and, providing all
  goes well, will offer competition for fellow new signings Lukas Nmecha and
  Dominic Calvert‑Lewin as well as Joël Piroe in Daniel Farke’s frontline.
  Okafor spent the second part of last season on loan at Napoli, making four
  appearances as Antonio Conte’s team won Serie A. At Milan, the player who
  began his career with Basel before moving to Red Bull Salzburg scored a modest
  seven goals in 39 league appearances. Those statistics do not reflect the
  versatility of a forward who can operate in assorted positions, including
  anywhere across the frontline. He has frequently been deployed as a winger for
  Switzerland, scoring twice in 24 senior international appearances.
  Encouragingly for Farke, Okafor proved Milan’s top scorer in pre‑season, with
  two of his goals coming against Liverpool in a friendly in Hong Kong. The
  Leeds manager has been keen to sign an extra striker after telling the club’s
  former No 9 Patrick Bamford that he is surplus to requirements. Wolves have
  signed the Cameroon defender Jackson Tchatchoua from Hellas Verona in a deal
  worth about £10m. The Belgium-born right wing‑back has spent the past two
  seasons in Serie A after starting his career at Charleroi. Tchatchoua is in
  effect a replacement for the former club captain Nélson Semedo, who rejected a
  new contract at Wolves in favour of a move to Fenerbahce. Tchatchoua, who
  produced the top speed in Serie A last season at 36.3km/h, has signed a
  five‑year deal. Vítor Pereira, the Wolves manager, is hopeful of making at
  least two more signings this window, with a forward and a midfielder high on
  the list of priorities. “[I am] waiting for the help of the club to sign new
  players,” Pereira said after the home defeat against Manchester City on
  Saturday. Wolves are wary of Jørgen Strand Larsen being high on Newcastle’s
  shortlist but consider the striker not for sale. The Norway forward is among
  Newcastle’s targets amid the protracted Alexander Isak saga after moves for
  Benjamin Sesko, among others, failed to materialise. Strand Larsen joined
  Wolves on a permanent basis in July, after the club triggered a £23m deal to
  buy a player who scored 14 league goals last season while on loan from La Liga
  side Celta Vigo. Newcastle have so far failed in their attempts to sign Yoane
  Wissa from Brentford, with the London club holding out for what they deem a
  fair price for the forward, while Eddie Howe’s side have been linked with a
  move for the out-of-favour Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson. It is thought that
  only a bid significantly above market value would give Wolves a decision to
  make on Strand Larsen, who is under contract until 2029. Wolves are open to
  offloading Hwang Hee-chan this summer, with Crystal Palace pursuing a loan
  deal for the South Korea forward. Matt Hobbs, the former Wolves sporting
  director who was influential in bringing Hwang to Molineux from RB Leipzig in
  2022, is thought to be close to filling a similar role at Palace, after Dougie
  Freedman departed for the Saudi side Al-Diriyah. Hwang, who scored only two
  league goals last season, has dropped down the pecking order under Pereira and
  was the subject of an inquiry from Birmingham earlier in this window.
  Fenerbahce pursue Álvarez loan deal Fenerbahce are pushing to complete a deal
  to sign West Ham’s Edson Álvarez on loan with an option to buy. The midfielder
  is surplus to requirements at the London Stadium and freeing up his wages,
  which are understood to be around £115,000 a week, will increase Graham
  Potter’s budget for new signings. West Ham value Álvarez at £20m but the
  finances of the deal have made it hard to find clubs willing to buy the Mexico
  international. Fenerbahce have emerged as a temporary solution and talks with
  the Turkish club are progressing. Álvarez has not made a decision on his
  future, however, and also has loan interest from Porto and Borussia Dortmund.
  Álvarez has fallen from favour under Potter, who is desperate for additions in
  midfield after seeing his side crash to a 3-0 defeat at Sunderland in their
  opening game. West Ham had a £30m bid rejected for Southampton’s Mateus
  Fernandes last week and were beaten by Newcastle to the signing of Jacob
  Ramsey from Aston Villa. Other options are being explored but the chances of
  anyone joining before Potter’s side host Chelsea on Friday are receding.
  Álvarez or Guido Rodríguez need to leave before West Ham move for certain
  targets, but West Ham are desperately short of energy and creativity in
  midfield. One of the midfielders signed to fill the void left by Declan Rice’s
  £105m sale to Arsenal two years ago, Álvarez has flattered to deceive since
  joining from Ajax for £35m. His lack of pace has been exposed at times and he
  was sent off twice last season. He was on the bench against Sunderland, with
  Potter preferring James Ward-Prowse and Rodríguez in midfield. Rodríguez, who
  joined on a free transfer from Real Betis last summer, is also available. The
  Argentinian has interest from Spain and Turkey but his high wages have put off
  prospective buyers. Andy Irving, the 25-year-old Scottish midfielder, is also
  up for sale. Potter and West Ham’s recruitment chief, Kyle Macaulay, are not
  working with a big budget this summer. They have signed four players since
  selling Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham for £54.5m.
