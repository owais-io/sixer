  Since the return of the Taliban in 2021, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been
  slashed, undermining the already impoverished countries’ ability to respond to
  disasters such as this one. Here is a video of the aftermath of the
  earthquake, which triggered landslides and flooding after hitting
  Afghanistan’s eastern Kunar province overnight: The number of Afghan refugees
  in Iran and Pakistan surged after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan
  in 2021. Since returning to power, the militant Islamists have banned women
  from paid work and girls from secondary education, as well as issuing a series
  of edicts that ban women from many areas of public life, including walking in
  parks and even speaking in public. Many people have fled to neighbouring
  countries to escape the oppressive regime, often without proper documentation.
  Pakistan has taken in Afghans through decades of war, but officials say the
  country’s public services can’t cope with the influx and have, along with
  Afghanistan, stepped up deportations in recent months. At least 1.2 million
  Afghans have been forced to return to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan so
  far this year, according to a June report by UNHCR. Afghans living in Iran
  have been leaving in large numbers since October 2023, when authorities
  announced a crackdown on foreigners who it said were in the country illegally.
  Israel’s war with Iran over the summer forced many to flee as Israeli
  airstrikes targeted the country. Afghanistan is already suffering a
  “multiplicity of crises” under the Taliban-run government, the UN’s high
  commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has told Sky News in an interview.
  Grandi said the unfolding situation in the country was “very tragic” as
  Afghanistan is already suffering from a “big drought” while Iran has “sent
  back almost 2 million people” and Pakistan “threatens to do the same”. “We
  have very little information as of yet, but already, reports of hundreds of
  people killed and many more made homeless,” he said. “It’s extremely difficult
  to mobilise resources because of the Taliban. So it’s a perfect storm,” Grandi
  added. Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires
  from Afghanistan: UN secretary general António Guterres has expressed his
  condolences to those affected by the earthquake in Afghanistan. “I stand in
  full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan after the devastating
  earthquake that hit the country earlier today,” he said. The UN said earlier
  on social media that its teams in Afghanistan are “delivering emergency
  assistance and life-saving support”. But many of the badly affected areas are
  remote and have limited telecoms networks, complicating rescue efforts. The
  death toll from the earthquake that has risen to over 800, the Taliban
  government spokesperson has said in an update, with the majority of deaths
  occurring in the remote Kunar province. About 800 people died and 2,500 others
  were injured in Kunar, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a press conference
  in Kabul, adding that the toll of 12 dead and 255 injured in the Nangarhar
  province had not changed. One resident in Afghanistan’s Nurgal district, one
  of the worst-affected areas in Kunar, said almost the entire village had
  collapsed under the force of the earthquake. “Children are under the rubble.
  The elderly are under the rubble. Young people are under the rubble,” the
  villager, who did not give his name, told the Associated Press. “We need help
  here,” he pleaded. “We need people to come here and join us. Let us pull out
  the people who are buried. There is no one who can come and remove dead bodies
  from under the rubble.” As we mentioned in the summary post (see 07.28),
  Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush
  mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
  Afghanistan has a number of fault lines and frequent movement among three
  nearby tectonic plates. A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than
  1,000 people last year, underscoring the vulnerability of one of the world’s
  poorest countries to natural disasters. A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck
  Afghanistan on 7 October 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban
  government estimated that at least 4,000 people died. The UN gave a far lower
  death toll of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike
  Afghanistan in recent memory. Rescuers are operating across Afghanistan’s
  east, with helicopters helping bring the injured to safety, while rubble is
  combed through in the hunt for survivors. The Taliban interior ministry has
  said in a statement that the vast majority of deaths occurred in the Kunar
  region (610), with a further 12 deaths in Nangarhar. The disaster will further
  stretch the resources of the south Asian nation already grappling with
  humanitarian crises and a sharp drop in aid. In a post on X, the UN
  Afghanistan account wrote: The UN in Afghanistan is deeply saddened by the
  devastating earthquake that struck the eastern region &amp; claimed hundreds
  of lives, injuring many more. Our teams are on the ground, delivering
  emergency assistance &amp; lifesaving support. Our thoughts are with the
  affected communities. The Afghan Red Crescent said its officials and medical
  teams have “rushed to the affected areas” of the earthquake and are “providing
  emergency assistance to impacted families”. Here is a summary from
  Afghanistan, where hundreds of people have been killed after an earthquake
  struck the country’s mountainous eastern region late last night. This is what
  we know so far: At least 622 people have been killed and more than 1,500
  others injured in the earthquake, Afghanistan’s Taliban-run interior ministry
  said on Monday morning. The earthquake struck the rugged province of Kunar at
  11.47pm on Sunday and was centred 27km north-east of the city of Jalalabad in
  Nangarhar province, the US Geological Survey said. Jalalabad is about 119km
  (74 miles) away from the capital city, Kabul. A 4.5 magnitude quake occurred
  20 minutes later in the same province. The Kunar Disaster Management Authority
  said deaths and injuries had been reported in the districts of Nur Gul, Soki,
  Watpur, Manogi and Chapadare. The earthquake reportedly shook buildings from
  Kabul to Pakistan’s capital Islamabad. Rescuers rushed to reach remote areas
  in the country’s eastern provinces in the aftermath of the earthquake but
  limited communications and the region’s narrow mountain roads have complicated
  rescue efforts. Officials from the Taliban-run government have asked for aid
  from international organisations. Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes,
  particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian
  tectonic plates meet. The death toll from the earthquake in Afghanistan has
  now risen to 622, Reuters has cited an Afghan interior ministry spokesperson
  as having said. Authorities said that more than 1,500 people were injured by
  the 6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan just before
  midnight local time on Sunday. Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for
  Afghanistan’s ministry of public health has said several villages in Kunar
  province have been “completely destroyed”, adding that rescue operations are
  underway there. The figures for martyrs and injured are changing. Medical
  teams from Kunar, Nangarhar and the capital Kabul have arrived in the area.”
  He said many areas had not been able to report casualties figures and that
  “the numbers were expected to change” as death and injuries are reported. The
  quake struck the province of Kunar at 11.47pm on Sunday and was centred 27km
  north-east of the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, the US Geological
  Survey said. A 4.5 magnitude quake occurred 20 minutes later in the same
  province. Jalalabad is a bustling trade city due to its proximity with
  neighboring Pakistan and a key border crossing between the countries. Although
  it has a population of about 300,000 according to the municipality, its
  metropolitan area is thought to be far larger. Most of its buildings are
  low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, and its outlying areas
  include homes built of mud bricks and wood. Many are of poor construction.
  Jalalabad also has considerable agriculture and farming, including citrus
  fruit and rice, with the Kabul River flowing through the city. Rescuers were
  working in several districts of the mountainous province where the quake hit,
  levelling homes of mud and stone on the border with Pakistan’s Khyber
  Pakhtunkhwa region, officials said. An earthquake in eastern Afghanistan near
  the Pakistan border has killed hundreds and left more than a thousand injured,
  the country’s state-run broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA)
  reported, with fears that many more could be among the dead. The quake late
  Sunday hit a series of towns in the province of Kunar, near the city of
  Jalalabad in neighbouring Nangahar province. The 6.0 magnitude was just 8km
  deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more damage. The Kunar Disaster
  Management Authority said in a statement that at least 250 people were killed
  and 500 others injured in the districts of Nur Gul, Soki, Watpur, Manogi and
  Chapadare. Taliban-led health authorities in Kabul, however, said they were
  still confirming the official toll figure as they worked to reach remote
  areas. We’ll bring you more updates as they arrive.
