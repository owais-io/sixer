  The tide has turned. The great migration – when the shift to remote work
  prompted people to quit their jobs in droves – is officially over. Now comes
  the big hold. According to a new survey from consulting firm Robert Half, 73%
  of respondents – workers at companies – said they plan to stay in their
  current roles through 2025. They gave reasons like having “positive company
  culture” and “feeling professionally fulfilled” or “being well compensated” at
  their current job. But there’s also a fourth reason why so many are staying
  put: the job market isn’t great and people are worried. Job growth is
  significantly down. Job openings fell again to under 7.5m last month, a level
  that’s 4m below the openings available back in 2022. Wage gains during that
  same period had fallen from 6.7% to 4.1%. Microsoft, AT&amp;T, JP Morgan,
  Amazon and other companies are mandating their employees to return to their
  offices or lose their jobs. AI is already replacing workers at tech companies,
  Wall Street firms and retailers and some fear greater job losses in the not
  too distant future. Other cost cutting measures are leading big brands like
  Citi, Accenture, Tesla and Intel and other corporate giants to lay off tens of
  thousands of workers. And what a great opportunity for small businesses! For
  example, there’s my friend in Illinois. He has over 100 employees in his
  office. For years, he’s been spending half his days just walking around and
  talking to them. Telling them how important they are. Checking in on their
  lives and families. Asking them what they’re doing and what problems they’re
  having. Imagine working for that guy. Someone who genuinely cares about his
  workers. His turnover’s low. His retention is high. Or another client of mine
  in Pennsylvania who allocates a big piece of his operating budget every year
  to employee technical training. Fear AI? “No way”, he tells me. “I want my
  people to embrace it! They need to learn about all the AI features in our
  software applications so that they can not only get more work done for me
  during the day but have a more balanced life themselves.” Did I mention that
  he gets workforce development money from his state that pays for this extra
  training? Now you know. Another client of mine gives employees a $1,000
  educational “credit” to use however they want. “They can learn origami or take
  a knitting class for all I care,” she said to me. “Becoming a better person
  makes you a better worker too.” Not coincidentally, she also enjoys the tax
  deductions allowed for providing this benefit. There are other tax benefits
  that small business owners can use to recruit and retain all this available
  talent for healthcare, childcare, for hiring workers who were formerly
  incarcerated, off welfare or out of the military. In the midst of all this job
  chaos, small business hiring and employment has remained constant. The latest
  Small Business Employment Watch report from Paychex, the giant HR and payroll
  processing firm, found that in July hiring among those companies with less
  than 50 employees “remained steady” which, according to the company’s CEO
  “speaks to the resiliency of small businesses given the amount of uncertainty
  they faced so far this year”. Ever since I can remember my small business
  clients have complained about competing with big companies and the government
  for talent. Well, now the tide has turned. Big companies are laying off people
  by the tens of thousands. Governments are cutting their headcounts. The labor
  market is softening. But small businesses – who already employ half of this
  country’s workers – are still hiring and always looking for talent. The
  softening job market is a great opportunity for them. And for many workers.
