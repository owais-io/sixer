  At the start of a new season in January 2022, Emma Raducanu began her second
  full year on the WTA tour swimming in doubt. Not only was she trying to take
  steps forward after a life-changing summer, her off-season had been ravaged by
  contracting Covid-19, which forced her off the court for weeks in December. In
  her first match of the season, she found herself up against Elena Rybakina in
  Sydney. She left the court with just one game to her name, losing 6-0, 6-1.
  That first encounter between Raducanu and Rybakina was a good representation
  of the difficulties Raducanu has had to navigate over the past few years: the
  pressure from her sudden rise, her underpowered game against the best players
  in the world and the fact that there was always another physical issue around
  the corner. As she faces the Kazakh again on Friday, the British No 1’s form
  underscores the consistent progress she has finally made in recent months.
  Raducanu has lost only six games in her first two matches at the US Open
  against Ena Shibahara and Janice Tjen and is playing quality tennis, serving
  confidently and pressuring her opponents by taking the ball early and forcing
  herself inside the baseline. However, her two opponents were qualifiers who
  have never broken the top 100. Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion,
  represents an enormous step up in quality and class. The 26-year-old is the
  best server in the women’s game, leading the tour in service games won,
  service points won and aces. She backs up that with some of the cleanest
  groundstrokes in the sport, generating easy pace off both wings. As she showed
  with her demolition of Aryna Sabalenka two weeks ago in Cincinnati, nobody is
  safe from being hit off the court when Rybakina is in full flow. Raducanu’s
  decision to hire Francisco Roig as her new coach was rooted in trying to
  improve her game in order to be better equipped to counter the elite players
  and biggest ball strikers, having lost to Sabalenka in Cincinnati and
  Wimbledon. Now she will have another chance to measure her progress. “I do
  want to see how my game suits and fits against the top,” said Raducanu. “I
  still think I have a long way to go, but I think I have been making steps
  towards getting closer and narrowing that gap. I think I have to take
  confidence from my matches against Aryna in Cincy and Wimby.” As Raducanu
  tackles one of the toughest opponents in this year’s women’s draw, Cameron
  Norrie finds himself up against the greatest player in any men’s draw. Just a
  few months after their meeting in the fourth round of the French Open, Norrie
  faces Novak Djokovic for a seventh time. This has been an eventful summer for
  Norrie, who returned to his favourite surface during the North American
  hard-court swing hopeful that his excellent quarter-final run at Wimbledon
  would propel him to greater heights, but he instead struggled with his
  physical condition in the heat. While his durability has long been one of his
  biggest assets, for once it was a problem. Norrie addressed those issues with
  a tough pre-US Open training block in the brutal heat at Texas Christian
  University, his alma mater, and he has performed well in New York. At the end
  of a tense, attritional four-hour match against Francisco Comesaña on
  Wednesday, he managed his nerves well and found a way to close out the match
  to reach the third round. Norrie has lost all six meetings with Djokovic,
  winning only two sets, and their previous matches have shown that he does not
  have the firepower to trouble Djokovic when the Serb is at his best. However,
  Norrie should head into this match believing that this is his best opportunity
  to push him to the limit. “I will say the chances are getting better as the
  years get on, but I would not say by much,” said Norrie. “But the level he
  brings, the competitiveness he brings is crazy. Every time I’ve played him,
  he’s changing his tactics and making it really difficult for me to play. So
  I’m just ready for anything. Him to play unreal. Him to play not great. Him to
  be stopping the match for something and then playing really good. I think he’s
  so, so good at competing and tactics. He’s amazing. So I’m going to have to be
  ready for anything and I want to just beat him with tennis and physicality.”
  Djokovic has not competed since Wimbledon after opting to prioritise his time
  with his family and his suboptimal preparation has clearly played a part in
  his two unimpressive wins over Learner Tien and Zachary Svajda. Djokovic
  struggled physically in his first-round match against Tien, who repeatedly
  dragged him into long, attritional exchanges, and emerged from them in far
  better condition. While Norrie will attempt to exploit the 38-year-old’s
  waning physicality even more effectively than those before him, it remains to
  be seen if Djokovic will allow him to get close.
