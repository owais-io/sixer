  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 13th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy
  Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 13th Prospects Building a new stadium befitting Everton’s ambitions
  proved a fraught and costly process. The same is true of David Moyes’s
  attempts to build a new team to realise those ambitions. Everton must hope
  that, like Hill Dickinson Stadium, their exhaustive efforts eventually pay
  off. The feel around Everton is at odds with the reality of Moyes’s summer at
  present. The move to a modern new home – which, despite Unesco’s objections,
  is the finest development along the River Mersey in decades – has generated a
  positivity unfamiliar to Evertonians after too long in the doldrums. But it is
  not the only source. A blessed end to the Farhad Moshiri era, stability and
  common sense under The Friedkin Group, the team’s uplift under Moyes in the
  second half of last season, Moyes himself, with his ability to rebuild a side
  and connection to the fanbase, all point to a club turning their troubles
  around and moving forward. But the squad? Not so much. Everton took 31 points
  from 19 league games under Moyes last season, a dramatic improvement on the 17
  from 19 collected in the fag end of Sean Dyche’s reign. Extrapolated across
  the campaign, Everton’s form under the returning Scot would have been good
  enough to finish eighth. That, in Moyes’s view, is where Everton should be
  aiming next and the bare minimum for a club of this stature. He want European
  qualification and an end to the club’s 30-year trophy drought, not a modest
  step to mid-table. But nine members of last season’s first team squad departed
  this summer – many with considerable Premier League experience – and attempts
  to replace and upgrade them have been largely frustrated. Moyes, now part of a
  football leadership team that shapes recruitment, has missed out on numerous
  targets with first-choice options deterred by the lack of European football
  and too many recent scrapes with relegation. It doesn’t promise to be a hectic
  end to the transfer window; it has to be one. The manager The Friedkin Group’s
  first big call as Everton owner could not have worked out better. Everton were
  one point above the relegation zone and in dismal form when Dyche was sacked
  in January. Moyes was quickly invited back after a 12-year absence and swiftly
  improved the team in all departments to banish relegation fears with ease. Age
  and the demands of the modern dressing room may have mellowed the 62-year-old,
  who received an OBE in June for his services to football, but he is as
  ambitious as ever and the perfect foreman for the reconstruction that Everton
  require. Off-field picture Last season was dominated by an emotional farewell
  to Goodison Park, home to Everton’s men’s team for 133 years and now the new
  home for Everton’s women, and a stadium will take centre stage again as the
  club relocate to a magnificent new residence on the banks of the River Mersey.
  Hill Dickinson Stadium heralds a much-needed fresh start and will help improve
  Everton’s finances with greater commercial opportunities at the
  52,888-capacity venue. Access to and from the stadium will take some getting
  used to, and Moyes will be keen not to lose the intimidating advantages that
  Goodison offered. Star signing At the time of writing there is not a great
  pool to choose from but Everton’s standout signing is undoubtedly the France
  Under-21 forward Thierno Barry from Villarreal. Barry, as he prefers to be
  called, is 6ft 5in and had an impressive impact after joining the Spanish side
  from Basel last summer. He scored 11 goals in La Liga as Villarreal secured a
  return to the Champions League with a fifth-placed finish. An emerging
  prospect who cost £27m and is 23 in October, the striker fits the profile of
  signing that Everton want as they develop a team under Moyes. Stepping up The
  18-year-old Harrison Armstrong is on the right pathway, although Everton’s
  fortunes in the transfer market may determine his next step. The
  Liverpool-born midfielder made his Premier League debut last season, impressed
  on his first FA Cup start and signed a long-term contract in February before
  joining Derby on loan. There was also an international debut for England
  Under-18s, who he captained against France in March. Armstrong benefited from
  15 appearances for Derby and has looked sharp in pre-season. Another loan move
  has been mooted but there could be opportunity at Everton given their shortage
  of midfielders. A late decision beckons. A big season for … Everton’s captain,
  Séamus Coleman, has nothing to prove and could bow out a celebrated figure
  without making another appearance. But that is not how he will approach his
  17th and possibly final season as an Everton player. A series of injuries
  limited the defender to four starts last season but his presence behind the
  scenes, continually upholding standards and reinforcing what it means to play
  for Everton, made it important for Moyes that he received another 12-month
  contract. Coleman led out Everton in their final game at Goodison and could do
  the same in their first at Hill Dickinson Stadium, but he will be desperate to
  contribute more on the pitch.
