  The Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was left disappointed after a minute’s
  silence in honour of Diogo Jota had to be cut short by the referee before
  kick-off in the Community Shield at Wembley. Jota and his brother André Silva
  died in a car crash in Spain on 3 July and both were honoured before kick-off
  with wreaths laid on the pitch and a period of silence. The moment was
  interrupted by a minority of supporters from the Palace end, eliciting a
  strong response at the other end of the pitch, as well as from other Eagles
  fans, who tried to silence those not respecting the tribute. “Yes, I am
  disappointed,” Van Dijk said. “That is the only thing I can say. I don’t know
  who did that but there was plenty trying to shush it down, but obviously that
  doesn’t help it. But it is what it is. You can’t control how many fans were
  here today? Was it 80,000 people? So, yeah, it is disappointing to hear that,
  but if that person or those persons can go home and be happy with themselves,
  then …” Liverpool fans earlier paid respects with a rousing rendition of
  You’ll Never Walk Alone as the wreaths were brought out, raising a white
  banner reading “Diogo J” and featuring the forward’s image and number 20. The
  Liverpool great Ian Rush, the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, and the Football
  Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, laid the wreaths at the Liverpool end, as
  fans from both clubs expressed their respect with a standing ovation as the
  late siblings’ images were displayed on the big screens inside the stadium. On
  the disruption, the Liverpool head coach Arne Slot responded diplomatically.
  “I am a positive person and if I look at the respect that has been paid to
  them both,” he said. “I don’t think he had a bad intention, the guy or guys.
  The fans of Crystal Palace and everywhere around the world have paid huge
  respect to Diogo and Andre.”
