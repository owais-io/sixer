  Europe is drawing up “pretty precise plans” for a multinational troop
  deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees that will
  have the backing of US capabilities, European Commission President Ursula von
  der Leyen told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday.
  “President Trump reassured us that there will be [an] American presence as
  part of the backstop,” von der Leyen told the FT, adding that “That was very
  clear and repeatedly affirmed.” The deployment is set to include potentially
  tens of thousands of European-led troops, backed by assistance from the US,
  including control and command systems and intelligence and surveillance
  assets, the report said, adding that this arrangement was agreed at a meeting
  between US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
  senior European leaders last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his
  Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a showpiece summit in China
  on Sunday and is expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on
  Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war.
  Russian analysts have said the Ukraine war is now a main pillar of the
  bilateral relationship and that Moscow would want know how Beijing would
  respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the
  fighting. “The longer the war [on Ukraine] drags on, the more Russia will need
  China’s assistance, whether economically or other forms,” Lim said. “China
  also recognises that it is unlikely for Sino-US relations to return to their
  pre-2018 state and thus has no choice but to accept a close alignment with
  Russia.” Russian drone attacks on power facilities in northern and southern
  Ukraine overnight left nearly 60,000 customers without electricity. Ukraine’s
  largest private energy company, DTEK, said Russian drones had attacked four
  energy facilities in the Odesa region during the night, and local authorities
  reported that 29,000 people were left without electricity early on Sunday.
  Hardest hit was the port city of Chornomorsk, just outside Odesa, where homes
  and administrative buildings were also damaged, said Oleh Kiper, the governor
  of the wider Odesa region. Russian drones also targeted Ukraine’s northern
  Chernihiv region early on Sunday, damaging energy infrastructure and leaving
  30,000 households without electricity, including part of the city of Nizhyn,
  said local governor Viacheslav Chaus. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to
  retaliate by ordering more strikes deep inside Russia. “We will continue our
  active operations in exactly the way needed for Ukraine’s defence. The forces
  and resources are prepared. New deep strikes have also been planned,”
  Zelenskyy said on X after meeting Ukraine’s top general, Oleksandr Syrsky,
  without giving further details of the plans. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz
  said on Sunday that the war in Ukraine could still last for a long time and
  ending it quickly at the country’s expense was not an option. In an interview
  with German public broadcaster ZDF, Merz, when asked whether a ceasefire might
  be possible this year, said he hasn’t lost hope but “harbours no illusions,”
  and emphasised that supporting the country to defend itself against Russia was
  an “absolute priority.” “We are trying to end it as quickly as possible. But
  certainly not at the price of Ukraine’s capitulation. You could end the war
  tomorrow if Ukraine surrendered and lost its independence,” Merz said. A
  suspect has been arrested over the murder of the former Ukrainian
  parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said. “The
  suspect has given an initial testimony,” Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said
  on the Telegram messaging app. “Urgent investigative actions are currently
  under way to establish all the circumstances of this murder.” Parubiy, 54, was
  shot dead in the western city of Lviv on Saturday in what Zelenskyy called “a
  horrific murder” and a “matter of security in a country at war”. He had been
  parliamentary speaker from April 2016 to August 2019, and was one of the
  leaders of protests in 2013-14 calling for closer ties with the European
  Union. The Kremlin claimed that European powers were hindering US President
  Donald Trump’s efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine and that Russia would
  continue its operation in Ukraine until Moscow saw real signs that Kyiv was
  ready for peace. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media
  reporters that the “European party of war” was continuing to hinder US and
  Russian efforts on Ukraine. “We are ready to resolve the problem by political
  and diplomatic means,” Peskov said. “But so far we do not see reciprocity from
  Kyiv in this. So we shall continue the special military operation.“
