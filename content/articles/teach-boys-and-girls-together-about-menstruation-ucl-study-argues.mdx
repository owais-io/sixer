  Boys and girls should be taught together in mixed classes about menstruation
  to help reduce the stigma, secrecy and disinformation which still surrounds
  periods, according to researchers. A new study by University College London
  (UCL) claims schoolchildren are being given insufficient information about
  periods, with many receiving just two lessons during their entire school
  career: one at primary level and one in secondary school. It argues that
  lessons focus too narrowly on basic biological facts, with not enough
  information about how menstruation can affect wellbeing, problems with
  menstrual bleeding, and its impact on physical and academic performance. While
  some schools still choose to separate boys and girls to allow for sensitive
  discussions, the UCL study says mixed lessons are important for developing a
  broader understanding and helping boys better understand and support their
  friends and future partners. The study was based on a survey and focus group
  research among 55 women who were divided into two age groups: 18 to 25 years
  old and 26 to 40. Most were educated before relationships and sex education
  became mandatory in schools in England in 2020. Prof Joyce Harper, of the UCL
  Institute for Women’s Health, who led the research, said: “Educating pupils
  about periods may now be compulsory in schools in England and Wales, but we
  know that for many of them that still only amounts to two lessons in their
  entire school career. Our survey suggests that those lessons are still very
  much concerned with the basic biological facts around menstruation. “What we
  and the women who participated in our study are calling for is that lessons on
  menstruation need to be much more comprehensive, and cover everything from
  what effect periods can have on a girl or woman’s wellbeing and academic and
  sporting performance, to what abnormal bleeding looks like.” Although some
  participants in the research saw value in single-sex classes to allow students
  to speak more freely, they still felt mixed sessions were essential to improve
  overall understanding, said Harper. “They suggested this could help boys
  understand and support their friends and future partners through menopause.”
  The latest statutory government guidance on relationships, sex and health
  education (RSHE), published last month, says pupils should learn the facts
  about the menstrual cycle, including physical and emotional changes, by the
  end of primary school. By the end of secondary school, students should learn
  about period problems including premenstrual syndrome, heavy menstrual
  bleeding, endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome – as well as menopause.
  Sarah Hannafin, the head of policy for the National Association of Head
  Teachers, said teaching about periods was a vital part of health education for
  all pupils. “Although many schools may separate classes to create a safe space
  for discussions on topics like this, mixed-sex groups should also be planned
  as it is vital that pupils understand others’ experiences,” she said. Pepe
  Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College
  Leaders, said: “We fully support the need for boys and girls to be taught
  about menstruation in a comprehensive manner which goes beyond biological
  facts and covers the wider effects on wellbeing. While it is covered in the
  RSHE curriculum, we would welcome consideration of how teaching of this topic
  might be strengthened.” A Department for Education spokesperson said:
  “Understanding menstruation is an important part of growing up, which is why
  we have brought in a new RSHE curriculum to take effect next year, with clear
  guidance that pupils should be taught about both physical and emotional
  changes, as well as topics from endometriosis to heavy menstrual bleeding.”
