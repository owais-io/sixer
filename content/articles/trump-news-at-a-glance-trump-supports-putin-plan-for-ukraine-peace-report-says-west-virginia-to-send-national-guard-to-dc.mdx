  Donald Trump has told European leaders he believes a peace deal could be
  negotiated if the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, agrees to give up
  the Donbas region, which Russian invaders have not been able to seize in over
  three years of fighting, the New York Times reported on Saturday after his
  summit with Vladimir Putin. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks in
  Alaska told the Guardian that Putin demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donbas,
  which is made up of the Donestk and Luhansk regions, as a condition for ending
  the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline. Although
  Luhansk is almost entirely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key
  parts of Donetsk, including the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily
  fortified positions whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives. Here
