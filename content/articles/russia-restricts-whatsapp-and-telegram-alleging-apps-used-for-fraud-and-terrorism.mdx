  Russia has announced restrictions on the messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram,
  accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law
  enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. Moscow has clashed with foreign tech
  platforms for several years over content and data storage in a simmering
  dispute that intensified after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
  February 2022. Critics say Russia is trying to expand its control over the
  country’s internet space. Vladimir Putin has authorised the development of a
  state-backed messaging app integrated with government services, as Moscow
  seeks to establish what it calls digital sovereignty by promoting homegrown
  services and reducing its dependence on foreign-owned platforms. “In order to
  counteract criminals … measures are being taken to partially restrict calls on
  these foreign messengers,” the Interfax news agency quoted the communications
  regulator Roskomnadzor as saying. “No other restrictions have been imposed on
  their functionality.” Russia’s digital ministry said: “Access to calls in
  foreign messengers will be restored after they start complying with Russian
  legislation.” In a statement, WhatsApp’s owner, Meta, said: “WhatsApp is
  private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate
  people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block
  it from over 100 million Russian people. We will keep doing all we can to make
  end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including
  in Russia.” Telegram said it “actively combats misuse of its platform,
  including calls for sabotage or violence, as well as fraud” and removes
  “millions of pieces of harmful content every day”. Reuters reported that voice
  calls on Telegram had barely functioned since 11 August and that WhatsApp
  calls had been rendered impossible due to intermittent sound and a metallic
  buzzing. The digital development ministry said Telegram and WhatsApp had
  ignored repeated requests to take measures to stop their platforms being used
  for activities such as fraud and terrorism. Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the
  lower house of parliament’s information technology committee, said the
  platforms would need to open legal entities in Russia and cooperate with
  Roskomnadzor and law enforcement as part of their compliance with Russian law
  to lift the blocking measures. Meta was labelled an extremist organisation by
  Moscow in 2022, but WhatsApp, widely used in Russia, was allowed to remain.
  The messenger has received some penalties for failing to remove information
  banned by Russia. Gorelkin last month said that WhatsApp should prepare to
  leave the market. Another lawmaker described WhatsApp’s presence in the
  Russian market as a breach of national security. Critics have voiced concerns
  that Russia’s new state-backed messaging app may track its users’ activities
  and have suggested Russia could slow WhatsApp’s speeds to get users to migrate
  to the new platform. Human Rights Watch said in a report last month that
  Russia’s government was increasing its technological capacities and control
  over the country’s internet infrastructure, allowing for more widespread
  blocking and throttling of unwanted websites and censorship circumvention
  tools. This headline was amended on 14 August 2025. An earlier version
  inaccurately implied data sharing with Russia for WhatsApp and Telegram.
