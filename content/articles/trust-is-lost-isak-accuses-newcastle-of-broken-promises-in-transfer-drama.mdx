  Alexander Isak’s standoff with Newcastle threatened to descend into outright
  civil war on Tuesday night as the Sweden striker accused his club of breaking
  promises and betraying his trust. In an incendiary Instagram message he
  claimed their relationship “could not continue”. Isak has been endeavouring to
  force a move to Liverpool all summer but, so far, at least Newcastle have
  proved resistant, rejecting one £110m bid as they struggle to find
  replacements. The striker was due to have attended the Professional
  Footballers’ Association players’ player of the year awards in Manchester on
  Tuesday having been nominated for the top prize but he sent his apologies via
  his explosive social media post. Shortly after Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah won
  the main award for a third time, Isak’s words sent shockwaves through the
  corridors of power at St James’ Park. “When promises are broken and trust is
  lost, the relationship can’t continue,” he posted after expressing pride at
  being voted on to the PFA Premier League team of the 2024-25 season. Isak then
  thanked his teammates and “everyone at Newcastle” for supporting him along the
  way before increasing the pressure on the club’s Saudi Arabian owners to
  sanction his longed-for sale to Anfield. “I’m not at the ceremony tonight,” he
  posted. “With everything going on, it didn’t feel right to be there. “I’ve
  kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed
  people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn’t
  reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors. “The reality is
  that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To
  now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. “When promises are
  broken and trust is lost the relationship can’t continue. That’s where things
  are for me right now – and why change is in the best interests of everyone,
  not just myself.” Isak was understood to be furious when what he believed to
  be a promised pay rise was postponed last summer. At the time he had four
  years remaining on his contract worth £140,000 a week. His camp claim that
  last spring he made it clear to Newcastle’s manager and the club that he
  wanted to leave this summer, but Howe and the board interpret things very
  differently. This summer Isak skipped the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore
  and South Korea citing a thigh injury, undetectable on scans. He then spent a
  week training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, an excursion Howe
  learned about only through the media. More recently Isak has been training
  alone at Newcastle after other players have departed and he was excluded from
  a club social barbecue after refusing Howe’s overtures to reintegrate.
  Newcastle’s manager has said that Isak is “in control” of the situation. The
  board were preparing to fine the striker, who is understood to have rejected
  offers of a much-enhanced contract extension, the maximum permissible two
  weeks’ wages after he missed the club’s opening game of the season last
  Saturday, a goalless draw at Aston Villa. Later on Tuesday evening, Newcastle
  released a statement: “We are clear in response that Alex remains under
  contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that
  Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer. “We want to keep our best
  players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to
  their views. As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take
  into consideration the best interests of Newcastle United, the team and our
  supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a
  sale this summer have not transpired. “We do not foresee those conditions
  being met. “This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive
  to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be
  welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his teammates.”
