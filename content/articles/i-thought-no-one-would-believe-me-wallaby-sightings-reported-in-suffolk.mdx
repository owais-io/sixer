  At first glance Steven Ellis thought the small creature in the distance was a
  deer, but he soon realised he was witnessing something far more unusual. Ellis
  was near the village of Ilketshall St Andrew in Suffolk when he took out his
  camera and took a photograph of the animal, which turned out to be a wallaby.
  “We’ve got quite a few deer around, so I thought I must be mistaken,” he said.
  “But then I thought it was a kangaroo. I don’t think they’re far off. I stood
  there thinking: ‘Who do I ring to tell them?’ But I thought no one was going
  to believe me.” Wallabies are native to Australia but small wild populations
  descended from escapers do exist in the UK and sightings have become more
  common, especially in the Isle of Man. Ellis’s encounter on Tuesday was not to
  be the last. Suffolk police received a call of another sighting the next day
  about seven miles away. The animal hopped from the road into a field just
  outside the village of Wissett. A spokesperson for Suffolk police said that
  despite the brief flurry of attention no further sightings had been confirmed,
  and no individual or organisation had come forward to claim ownership of the
  animal. Police are asking the public to report any sightings directly to them.
  Occasional escapes from private collections have been documented in recent
  years. Wallabies are generally considered not dangerous to humans, but they
  can be unpredictable and should be treated with caution. Those hand-reared or
  accustomed to human presence can be gentle, but others can be easily startled,
  especially if they feel threatened.
