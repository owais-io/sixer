  Gerrymandering is the practice of redrawing the boundaries of political
  districts to favour certain parties or politicians. On Friday, Texas governor
  Greg Abbott signed a new redistricting bill with a gerrymandered map that will
  heavily favour Republicans – and California governor Gavin Newsom plans to
  retaliate by doing the same in his state for Democrats. Irresepective of the
  politics of gerrymandering, however, the ruse conceals some interesting maths.
  Such as – given a certain distribution of voters, how do you draw a map that
  makes the minority party win the majority of districts? It’s exactly this
  question that underlies today’s puzzles. In each of the grids below, the
  challenge is to find the unique electoral map in which the minority colour
  wins the most regions. A region is defined as a contiguous block of cells that
  are joined either horizontally or vertically. (A region cannot contain any
  cells that are only connected diagonally, i.e. via a corner.) Winning a region
  means having the most cells in that region. The puzzles were conceived by
  Brady Forrest, a university student in Toronto, whose online alias is Deckard.
  Example Divide the grid into 3 regions of 3 cells each. Purple, the minority
  colour, must win the majority of the regions. To solve using pencil and paper,
  click here for a print out (and some bonus puzzles). To play on your screen,
  below each puzzle is a link to an interactive version. Puzzle 1: Easy Divide
  the grid into 5 regions of 5 cells each. Purple, the minority colour, must win
  the majority of regions. Puzzle 2: Medium Divide the grid into 5 regions of 10
  cells each. Purple, the minority colour, must win the majority of regions. No
  ties allowed in any region. Puzzle 3: Hard Divide the grid into 7 regions of 7
  cells each. Blue, the minority colour, must win the majority of regions. No
  ties allowed for first place in any region. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the
  solutions. NO SPOILERS Please discuss the maths of gerrymandering. Thanks to
  Deckard for sharing his puzzles. Thanks to Starwort for the interactive
  versions. I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I’m
  always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one,
  email me. In other Gerry-related news, here’s a fact from my new book,
  Football School Facts. Gerry Taggart (ex-Bolton) is one of only four Premier
  League players to have been sent off on their birthdays. The wrong sort of
  card! This curio and hundreds of others appear in the book, the latest in the
  long-running series I write with Ben Lyttleton for children aged 7 to 107.
  Football School Facts is full-colour, hardback, would make an excellent gift,
  and is available at the Guardian Bookshop.
