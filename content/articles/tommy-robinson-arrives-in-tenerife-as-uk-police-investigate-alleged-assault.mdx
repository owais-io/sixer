  The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has arrived in Tenerife as British
  police seek to question him over an alleged assault after he was filmed close
  to a man who was left seriously injured on the ground. Robinson flew to Spain
  from the UK early on Tuesday. On Monday evening video emerged of him saying
  “he come at me”, an apparent claim of self-defence, at the scene of the
  alleged assault in St Pancras station in London as a 64-year-old man lay
  motionless on the ground. The injured man was still in hospital on Wednesday
  in a stable condition. Police are understood to be treating him as a victim,
  not a suspect, at this stage. Police have said he was admitted to hospital
  “with serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening”. CCTV
  from the busy central London station has been recovered and is being studied
  by detectives. British Transport Police (BTP) say they were called to St
  Pancras at about 8.40pm on Monday to reports of an assault. A source said
  detectives were confident they had identified the suspect for the alleged
  assault and were not seeking anyone else. Police are understood to have
  several lines of inquiry, one of which is locating Robinson. While he is known
  to have arrived in Tenerife, in the past he has travelled around Spain and
  into Portugal and Cyprus, sometimes relying on the hospitality of wealthy
  friends. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is a former
  leader of the extreme-right English Defence League. The far-right monitoring
  group Hope Not Hate describes him as the “best-known far-right extremist in
  Britain”. Police believe Robinson, 42, originally from Bedfordshire, took a
  flight out of Britain shortly after a video was put online showing him near
  the injured man. The video shows Robinson claiming the man had attacked him
  first, and was filmed at St Pancras station, where he had been leafleting
  earlier in the day. BTP said on Tuesday: “Following a report of an assault at
  St Pancras station last night (28 July), officers have confirmed that the
  suspect, a 42-year-old man from Bedfordshire, boarded a flight out of the
  country in the early hours of this morning. Detectives are continuing to work
  closely to progress the investigation and bring him into custody for
  questioning.” In the video, a man can be seen lying face down and motionless,
  with Robinson pacing nearby. Robinson can be heard saying: “He come at me
  bruv.” Shortly afterwards, Robinson tells an onlooker: “He come at me, you saw
  that.” The video seen on social media does not show how the injured man came
  to be lying motionless on the floor. Nothing known publicly at this stage
  proves or disproves any version of the alleged assault, nor who may have been
  at fault. The Conservatives’ home affairs spokesperson, Chris Philp, a
  policing minister in the last government, told the Guardian that the case
  raised questions about border security. Philp said: “The fact that a wanted
  fugitive was able to pass through our international border should not be
  allowed to happen and it is further evidence of this government’s complete
  lack of border control, inbound or outbound.” A government spokesperson said:
  “This is an operational matter for the police.”
