  As summer draws to a close, it’s no surprise this month’s favourites reflect
  the transitional feeling of this time of year. There’s a hint that some of you
  still have a holiday coming up or are hoping for a late spurt of hot weather,
  as you’ve been looking at gel heel socks to get your feet sandal-ready and
  portable fans to keep you cool. For some of you, though, it’s clear the “back
  to school” energy September brings has already taken effect. You’re investing
  in plastic-free scourers to crack on with the cleaning you’ve neglected during
  busy summer months, and treating yourself to a new office chair to upgrade
  your work-from-home setup. Whether you’re clinging on to the year’s final
  warmer weather or ready to embrace crisp, cosy autumn days, here are your
  favourite things to see you through the transition. *** Socks that will leave
  your feet marshmallow soft Gel heel socks £8.99 for three pairs at Amazon If
  your feet are in need of a refresh, Sali Hughes recommends sleeping in these a
  few times a week. “Apply a little body cream before bed, pull on the socks,
  and wake to marshmallow-soft feet,” she says. A versatile tool for getting
  your feet holiday ready or soothing dry, cracked heels in colder months. *** A
  year’s supply of plastic-free sponges Seep sponge scourers £26 for 12 at Seep
  It’s easy to neglect household chores during the chaos of summer, but many of
  you have been getting back on track with these eco-friendly and practical
  scourers. A big hit from my guide to plastic-free kitchen swaps, these loofah
  and wood-pulp cellulose sponges are safe to use on nonstick pans, and a box of
  12 should last a year. *** Top-rated fan Handheld and foldable desk fan £12 at
  John Lewis Many of you sought relief from the August heatwave with this
  handheld fan from John Lewis. It was rated the best overall in our test of the
  best portable fans, and reviewer Alan Martin says it “provides what you need
  without fuss” at a very reasonable price. It has a battery life of up to four
  hours (on the highest setting) – ideal for late-season holidays and long
  journeys. *** A budget reusable bottle Ion8 leakproof stainless steel bottle,
  400ml £14.99 at Decathlon Zoë Phillimore tested 42 reusable water bottles for
  her roundup of the best, rating this compact option from Ion8 the best budget
  buy. “It’s great for the commute and chucking in your bag on the run,” she
  says – and her leak test proved you won’t need to worry about spillages on the
  go. *** A toy to spice up your sex life Penile stimulating sleeve £26 at Tenga
  Alix Fox’s extensive guide to spicing up your sex life is full of toys and
  accessories, from massage mitts to saliva-stimulating mints, to add some oomph
  in the bedroom. If you’re hoping to liven things up and aren’t sure where to
  start, this penile stimulating sleeve was the most popular choice with
  readers. *** The alcohol-free merlot Oddbird Domaine De La Prade merlot £10.06
  at Amazon If, like me, you’re planning on having a sensible September, then
  low-alcohol drinks are a great way to relax and unwind without the risk of
  hangover. Wine expert Sophia Longhi describes this merlot from Oddbird as
  “youthful with fruity blackberry and plum notes” in her roundup of the best
  no- and low-alcohol wines. *** The leakproof travel mug Stanley AeroLight
  insulated travel mug £33 at John Lewis As we inch closer to crisper, cooler
  weather, a travel mug will be great for sipping hot drinks on autumn walks.
  Pete Wise named this offering from Stanley the most leakproof in his test of
  the best travel mugs, making it an excellent option for commuting. “I bounced
  on a trampette with it, shook it upside down, threw it over my head – and not
  a drop was spilt,” he said. *** An affordable office chair Habitat Beck mesh
  office chair £95 at Argos “It’s less than £100, but the Beck looks and feels
  like a more expensive chair,” said Stuart Andrews in his guide to the best
  office chairs. This bright pink and orange chair was rated the best budget
  option and is making for a cheery upgrade to many of our readers’ home office
  setups. *** A moisturiser for mature skin Charlotte’s magic body cream, 200ml
  £49 at Cult Beauty This Charlotte Tilbury moisturiser has peptides, caffeine,
  hyaluronic acid and glycerine to “help smooth, soothe and plump mature skin”,
  says Sarah Matthews, who rated this cream the best for mature skin in her
  guide to the best body moisturisers. A great all-rounder for keeping skin
  hydrated after sun exposure or soothing dry skin as the weather gets colder.
  *** A scent for the new season &amp;Horace eau de parfum, 50ml £62 at Horace
  “With fewer balmy nights on the horizon, you may want to change your
  lightweight spritz to one more woody or aromatic,” said Peter Bevan in his
  August men’s style essentials. And many of you wanted that change. He
  recommends &amp;Horace as the ideal transitional scent, with notes of
  sandalwood, bergamot, white pepper and tobacco for a scent that’s “at once
  crisp and warm”.
