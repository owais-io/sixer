  South Korea’s former first lady Kim Keon Hee, the wife of the impeached former
  president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested on corruption charges, a special
  prosecutor leading a wide-reaching probe said. The arrest, which came after a
  Seoul central district court ruling, creates an unprecedented situation in
  which both members of a former presidential couple are simultaneously in
  custody. The court granted the warrant citing the risk of tampering with
  evidence, according to Yonhap news agency. “The arrest warrant against Kim has
  been issued,” the prosecutors said in a brief statement. The charges against
  Kim include violations of capital market and financial investment laws, as
  well as political funds laws. She denies the charges. Yoon Suk Yeol was sent
  back into detention in July as prosecutors investigate his failed attempt to
  impose martial law in December last year. A special counsel was established
  after Lee Jae Myung was elected president in June to investigate 16 criminal
  allegations against Kim. However, Wednesday’s arrest warrant covered only
  three charges. Prosecutors allege she made over 800 million won (£428,000)
  through manipulating the stock prices of Deutsch Motors, a local BMW
  dealership, between 2009 and 2012, by conspiring with others to artificially
  inflate shares. She is also accused of receiving over 270 million won worth of
  illegal political funding through free opinion polling services, and using
  this to influence candidate selections for the conservative People Power party
  in the country’s 2022 byelections. The third charge involves accepting luxury
  gifts including Chanel handbags and expensive jewellery from the Unification
  Church through a shaman intermediary, in exchange for favourable treatment of
  development projects in Cambodia. Kim was questioned for over seven hours by
  investigators last week before the arrest warrant was sought. On issuing the
  warrant, judge Jeong Jae-wook cited “concerns about evidence destruction” as
  the primary reason for detention, according to Yonhap News. Kim had spent four
  and a half hours in court, where she denied all charges against her. During
  the hearing, Kim reportedly expressed frustration about her personal affairs
  being scrutinised, telling the judge she was “upset that even issues from
  before my marriage keep being brought up”. She will be held at Nambu detention
  centre in south-western Seoul, separate from her husband, who has been in
  custody at Seoul detention centre since July. Once considered to wield
  enormous influence behind the scenes during her husband’s presidency, the
  former arts exhibition company executive was embroiled in a series of issues
  throughout his term, including the infamous Dior bag scandal, which
  prosecutors are now also reinvestigating. In recent weeks, her master’s and
  doctoral degrees were both revoked over thesis plagiarism.
