  Talks between nations to hammer out a plastics treaty to end plastic pollution
  continued behind closed doors in Geneva on Thursday, the final day of
  negotiations, as civil society groups urged countries to “hold the line” to
  secure a strong agreement. With time running out to seal a deal between 184
  countries, environmental groups expressed concern that frontline communities,
  Indigenous people and others suffering the worst impacts of the world’s
  growing plastic crisis were being “sold out” in an effort to secure a treaty,
  without meaningful or legally binding measures that would address the scale of
  the problem, “at any cost”. This week’s negotiations towards a legally binding
  agreement to tackle plastic pollution are the latest in five rounds of talks
  over the past two and a half years, which have so far failed to produce a
  deal. Talks at the UN offices stalled on Wednesday after a consensus draft
  treaty, presented by the chair of the event, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, was
  rejected by 80 countries. The ambitious countries – who want curbs on
  production – described it as “unacceptable”, a “lowest common denominator” and
  a toothless waste management instrument, because it did not include production
  caps nor address the chemicals used in plastic products. Countries from the
  “like minded” group, chiefly oil-producing countries and including Saudi
  Arabia, who want the treaty to focus on recycling and voluntary measures, said
  it crossed too many of their red lines and did not do enough to pare down the
  scope of the treaty. Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation, said:
  “The entire day has been behind closed doors. All of civil society is on edge,
  waiting to see what the next move is going to be from the chair and from the
  secretariat. We are nervous, we are anticipating, and we’re concerned that
  we’re going to be sold out in an effort to get a treaty at any cost. “Civil
  society, frontline communities, Indigenous peoples, everyone is united in
  wanting to see something meaningful here. And we’re praying that these
  governments are going to do the right thing and put our collective health
  before short term profits for the petrochemical sector.” A rush for a weak
  treaty in Geneva, Forbes said, “would be a disaster”. Some NGOs said they had
  “lost faith” in a process with the need for consensus between a majority of
  countries that want production caps versus a small but powerful minority of
  oil- and plastic-producing nations that continue to reject production limits.
  Christina Dixon, a campaign lead at the Environmental Investigation Agency,
  said the need for consensus was being “weaponised”. “A lot of civil society
  have lost faith in the process, because we’ve consistently seen a majority of
  countries aligning around a vision for the type of treaty that we’d be happy
  with. Yet, because of the way that this is being weaponised, we’re constantly
  bowing to a small but vocal minority who are holding it hostage,” she said.
  This system was allowing a majority of countries to be “drowned out”, Dixon
  said. She urged: “What we need to see tonight is that the views of that
  majority reflected fairly.” Earlier on Thursday, Camila Zepeda, the director
  general for global affairs at Mexico’s ministry of foreign affairs and a
  negotiator at the talks, said: “If [the next treaty draft] is exactly the
  status quo, then we’ll need to assess if it’s better to then keep working and
  trying to find a better environment for this topic, but it’s too early to tell
  … “We understand it will be a very simple treaty at this stage. But if the key
  components are there and we can build it in time, then we will be signing. By
  now, we’ve given up bans, we’ve given up production limits. We’ve given up so
  much, so much. “As ambitious countries, we want an outcome, and we see that if
  we don’t get an outcome, we’re risking a lot. But at the same time, we won’t
  take just anything.” Before this week’s talks, an expert review published in
  the Lancet described plastics as “a grave, growing and under-recognised danger
  to human and planetary health”. It estimated health-related damages globally
  added up to £1.1tn annually, with infants and children particularly
  vulnerable. However, some delegates were still hopeful. Sivendra Michael, the
  Fiji government’s permanent secretary for the ministry of environment and
  climate change, said: “There is still time. There are still processes that the
  chair can explore. There are many other innovative processes that have worked
  in other multilateral settings that can be explored. “It’s important for us to
  take a step back and reflect that we are negotiating at the edge of a
  planetary emergency.” The talks continue.
