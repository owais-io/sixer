  After taking six months to conclude that Vladimir Putin may not be a kindred
  transactional authoritarian leader but an ideological nationalist seeking the
  return of what “belongs to Russia”, the deadline Donald Trump set for the
  Russian president to agree a Ukraine ceasefire or face US sanctions on oil
  exports arrives on Friday. What Trump – who some had claimed was a Russian
  asset – does next to punish Putin could define his presidency. It is a
  remarkable turnaround and one that seasoned Trump watchers such as Michael
  McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, said they had never expected. Only
  months ago the debate was about what further inducements Trump would offer
  Putin to end the fighting. His administration has not introduced any sanctions
  against Russia, compared with at least 16 sets of actions in every prior six
  months back to February 2022, according to a report submitted to the Senate
  banking committee by top Democrats this week. Trump first set Putin a 50-day
  deadline then cut weeks off it. “Secondary sanctions and tariffs against
  China, India and Brazil, which buy Russian oil, are the obvious next step in
  an attempt to stop the conflict,” the US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker,
  predicted on Tuesday. But as the deadline approaches, there is lingering
  scepticism about how far Trump will go. He has dispatched his special envoy,
  Steve Witkoff, to Moscow for the fifth time for last-minute talks and on
  Friday Trump admitted he did not think sanctions would have much impact as
  Russians are “wily characters and pretty good at avoiding sanctions”. He has
  also given himself maximum room for political manoeuvre by ensuring the US
  Senate did not pass legislation before its summer recess that would have
  empowered him to slap bone-crushing 500% tariffs on exports from countries
  that import Russian oil, principally India, China, Brazil and Turkey. Trump
  had argued that the congressional legislation was unnecessary as he can act
  through executive orders, mentioning instead 100% tariffs on economies that
  import Russian oil – a whopping number, even if lower than the 500% floated by
  the Republican senator Lindsey Graham. It is striking that in the run-up to
  Witkoff’s talks in Moscow that Trump, normally keen to tout his leverage
  before a negotiation, has given only sketchy detail of the punishments the
  importers of Russian energy may face, either in terms of US sanctions on
  foreign refineries importing Russian oil or US tariffs on countries importing
  Russian oil. Some of Trump’s warnings this week to the Indian prime minister,
  Narendra Modi, that he would raise tariffs on India because its government did
  not care “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war
  machine” do not yet seem to fit into a wider strategy. The tensions appears as
  much about Trump’s previous complaints with India’s trade practices as its
  purchases of cheap Russian oil. They are due to start on August 27. Rachel
  Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Century,
  said if India was to receive a penalty but China – the largest buyer of most
  Russian crude – did not, the Russian oil trade may just go further
  underground. Some of Trump’s advisers, notably the Treasury secretary, Scott
  Bessent, warned China last week of tariff hikes related to Russia energy
  purchases, but it is hard to see such threats as credible given Trump’s
  eagerness for a trade deal with China and the risks associated with a sudden
  stop to trade between China and the US. In 2024 China accounted for 32% of
  Russian petroleum and oil exports. McFaul told Foreign Policy magazine about a
  possible boomerang effect if generalised increases in tariffs turn into a full
  trade war. Trump has wavered about the impact of economic pressure on Putin.
  Many academics say that sanctions on oil reshape economic relationships and
  change markets rather than produce changes in state behaviour. Three years of
  sanctions on Russia have so far been – at best – a slow burn. Russia chalked
  up economic growth of 4% in 2023 and 2024, kept unemployment to an astonishing
  2%, and even reduced social inequality by sustaining real wage growth that has
  disproportionately benefited Russians at the lower end of the economic ladder,
  a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
  Washington-based thinktank, found. The authors predicted that Russia’s economy
  can withstand the current level of sanctions for at least three more years.
  But the report also pointed to developing vulnerabilities in Russia. Interest
  rates are at 18%, inflation stubbornly high and growth is stalling. Russia has
  had to rework its 2025 budget as oil revenues slipped, largely because of a
  fall in prices and the discounts importers such as India could demand. As a
  result, government revenues from Russian oil and gas in May-June were 35%
  lower than the same period in 2024, the Kyiv School of Economics said in its
  July review. Russian oil export revenue is projected to drop 16% from $189bn
  (£142bn) in 2024 to $163bn in 2025 and $151bn in 2026. The federal budget
  deficit reached 3.7tn rubles ($40.4bn) in the first half of 2025 – 97% of the
  full-year target of 3.8tn rubles. This is more than five times larger than the
  deficit in the first half of 2024 and 57% higher than the largest first
  six-month deficit in recent years (2023). Oil prices are unlikely to recover
  significantly, meaning Russia will miss its budget target by a wide margin,
  increasing reliance on its national welfare fund (NWF) and domestic debt
  issuance. The NWF’s liquid assets are also under pressure, with Russia
  expected to draw heavily on these reserves by year end. In a report this week,
  Oxford Economics predicted that Russia “may tip into recession”. The overall
  reason is simple: the level of military spending, including the cost of
  voluntary recruitment is distorting the economy. The economist Janis Kluge,
  who conducts research on Russia at the Berlin thinktank SWP, thinks overall
  Russian military spending is 8 to 10% of GDP once all expenditure including
  regional recruitment is included. The pressure could grow. The EU’s most
  recent sanctions package included a ban from next January on buying oil
  products made from Russian crude. The package for the first time put sanctions
  on a big Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, causing Microsoft this week to
  suspend software services. Other refineries could be placed under sanction –
  with the UK likely following suit – but the question then arises as to how the
  supply gap created by the loss of Russian oil can be filled. Moreover, if
  Trump is joining sanctions, the US and Europe will have to come to a joint
  decision on the continuing value of the elaborate oil price cap, a Biden-era
  device designed to squeeze Russian oil profits while keeping the global price
  of oil low. The cap was introduced across the G7 in December 2022 and operates
  by withdrawing insurance from any shipping company that has not obtained a
  certificate that it is selling Russian oil below $60 a barrel, but a multitude
  of problems have arisen. In recent months, as the price of oil has fallen,
  it’s become evident the $60 cap was set too high. The cap has also led to the
  birth of a shadow fleet of oil tankers operating without formal insurance that
  are now being sanctioned by the EU, the US and the UK. The UK and the EU have
  agreed to lower the price cap from 2 September to $47.60 a barrel, but Trump
  is keeping the US cap at $60 a barrel, a recipe for circumvention. The one
  prerequisite is that Trump must not back off, McFaul said. “Making threats and
  not carrying through with them is one of the biggest mistakes you can make in
  diplomacy.” The former ambassador recalled George Shultz, the great Reagan-era
  US secretary of state, saying “never point a gun at anyone unless you are
  prepared to shoot”.
