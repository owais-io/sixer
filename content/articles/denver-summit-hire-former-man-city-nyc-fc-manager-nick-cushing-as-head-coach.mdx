  Nick Cushing, the former Manchester City women and NYC FC manager, has been
  appointed as the first head coach of the expansion National Women’s Soccer
  League team Denver Summit FC, who will play their inaugural NWSL season in
  2026. Cushing, who won the 2016 English top-flight title during his first
  spell in charge of Manchester City, will begin work with Denver immediately,
  as they prepare for NWSL life after it was announced last December that they
  had been awarded a franchise spot as part of the division’s expansion to 16
  clubs for 2026. Boston Legacy FC are also joining the NWSL as a new outfit.
  The Colorado club announced its new name and unveiled its crest and kit colour
  in July. They have been backed by high-profile investors, including the
  American skiing icon Mikaela Shiffrin, who is from Colorado, and they have
  plans to move to a new 14,500-seat purpose-built stadium in 2028. Cushing won
  six major trophies, including two Women’s FA Cups, three League Cups, and
  Manchester City’s sole women’s league title to date during his six-year spell
  at the helm of the English club. He left in 2020 to take up an assistant role
  at MLS side New York City FC, where he was elevated to head coach in 2022. He
  returned to Man City as the Women’s Super League side’s interim head coach in
  March 2025, overseeing a fourth-placed finish after the sacking of Gareth
  Taylor. It is understood the chance to return to life and work in the United
  States with his family was something the 40-year-old particularly wanted,
  preferring this unique proposition from Denver over interest from other
  English clubs. Cushing said: “Denver Summit FC’s commitment to building a
  world-class soccer organisation really inspired me. We have a passionate,
  committed fanbase and we have to put a team on the field that replicates that.
  Our team will play an attacking form of the game that excites our stadium and
  makes things difficult for our opponents. We want to create a winning team as
  well as a great experience for all of Colorado.” Prior to Cushing’s
  appointment, the new club named Curt Johnson as their general manager. The
  former North Carolina Courage GM added: “In order to be successful right away,
  you need people that have experienced environments like this, have built
  organisations, and have had success. Nick brings world-class experience, a
  passion for player development, and a tactical vision that will excite Summit
  supporters. He’s won major trophies and is the right leader to guide us into
  our first season and beyond.”
