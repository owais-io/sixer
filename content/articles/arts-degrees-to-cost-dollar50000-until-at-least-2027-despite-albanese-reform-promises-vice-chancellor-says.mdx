  Students will be paying $50,000 for arts degrees until at least 2027, says one
  university vice-chancellor, despite the Albanese government labelling the
  controversial job-ready graduates scheme (JRG) that included an increase to
  some fees a “failure” and promising to reform it. The Morrison government
  program increased the price of university degrees including arts, humanities
  and law, while reducing the cost for Stem degrees including mathematics and
  essential worker degrees including teaching and nursing. The Western Sydney
  University vice-chancellor, George Williams, a vocal critic of the program,
  told Guardian Australia he was “hopeful” it could be reformed in time for
  students studying in 2027. “I’ll be hopeful for 2027 but it’s looking
  challenging given what the government has already prioritised, and it will
  take some months to get through the process,” he said. “I thought this might
  have been fixed in the first term of Labor; it’s taken longer than it should
  have.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email The government has set up the
  Australian Tertiary Education Commission to redesign university fees. But
  legislation must be passed before Atec can be officially established in early
  2026. Prof Andrew Norton, an expert in higher education at the Monash business
  school, said this meant a 2027 timeframe would be the absolute earliest to
  change the structure of university fees. “The government will get this new
  commission to advise them on new funding rates, and the broad idea is they go
  back to the old system where there’s some rough relationship between earnings
  and the fees you pay,” he said. “The government [then] has to accept that
  advice, legislate that advice, and introduce the policy … this will probably
  take most of 2026, so 2027 is the earliest possible date in my view for a
  different student contribution system.” Norton and Williams believe cost is
  the primary factor for the delay. “They [the commonwealth] would either have
  to significantly increase student contributions in other courses to offset the
  cost, which has obvious political implications,” Norton said. “Or they would
  have to substantially increase subsidies from the government budget, which
  they’d be reluctant to do given their overall fiscal situation.” The
  universities accord released its interim report about the sector in July 2023
  which found JRG had failed. It recommended the scheme be replaced. Soon after
  that, the education minister, Jason Clare, scrapped a rule introduced under
  the scheme, which removed Hecs debt eligibility for students who failed more
  than 50% of their units. Other recommendations included introducing payments
  for some students taking part in practical placements, which the government
  has also implemented. On 19 AugustvClare told the AFR education summit the fee
  structure would be changed but it wasn’t a priority. “We’re taking reform one
  step at a time,” he said. “Whether it’s the structure of universities or
  whether it’s fixing JRG, reform is a bit like eating an elephant – one bite at
  a time. “I’ve never ruled out reform here. It’s all about what you do first.”
  This month Labor backbenchers publicly put pressure on the government to speed
  up the reforms. The Victorian MP Carina Garland, for example, said the issue
  was frequently raised with her by constituents and she did not want to see the
  scheme become “too entrenched”. Williams said students from lower
  socioeconomic backgrounds and women were most affected by the scheme. “It was
  a failed and flawed idea in the first place but what it does do is provide a
  major disincentive for students to go to university,” he said. “That’s
  particularly students from poorer backgrounds, Indigenous students and women,
  who are the biggest users of an arts degree.” The Western Sydney University
  chancellor, Jennifer Westacott, agreed, and said arts degrees were an
  important step for some people to access further education. “For many people
  in low [socioeconomic status] brackets, an arts degree is a very important
  entry level qualification for people to [then] go on and do more study in
  specialty fields. “The idea that we are not going to have serious investment
  in humanities in this AI-digitised world is crazy. We’ve got to not lose sight
  of the fact that what you need is critical thinkers, people who are good at
  problem solving, people who have a philosophy about the world, people who
  understand ethics and values.” Clare’s office was contacted for comment.
