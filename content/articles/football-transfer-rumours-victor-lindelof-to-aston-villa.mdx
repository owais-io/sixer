  Don’t be sad it’s over, be glad it happened: the storied transfer window of
  summer 2025, soon to become the stuff of myth and legend, its tales passed
  down the generations for evermore, is almost over. This leaves us with no
  option but to focus on the peripheral trudge of actual football – or would if
  it weren’t for the blasted international break – so before we reduce ourselves
  to the tedium of that indignity, let us enjoy one final day of obscenely rich
  and artless men passing money to other obscenely rich and artless men, the
  beautiful game incarnate. After a summer spent grizzling about the unfairness
  of not being allowed to spend way more money than they make, when all they
  really want to do is celebrate the incomparable glory of having billionaire
  owners, Aston Villa are springing into action. After the overwhelming success
  of Marcus Rashford’s two goals (one penalty) against Preston, along with
  another crucial strike in a 3-0 home win over Brighton, having ticked the fast
  and strong box, they’re now seeking to fill the slow and weak slot, in talks
  to sign another winger of whom Manchester United want shot. Should Jadon
  Sancho refuse the move, they plan to fill that spot in their squad with a
  large cushion. Villa also fancy Antwerp’s goalie Senne Lammens, who may be
  prepared to join them now that Manchester United appear to prefer their
  incumbent, Emiliano Martínez. Surely on to a greater winner than any other
  transferred player in history, given his brief is simply to be less disastrous
  than André Onana and Altay Bayindir, his naturally sunny and respectful
  demeanour is also felt to be a perfect fit for Old Trafford. Nor is that it.
  Also moving to the Midlands is Fletcher Boyd, Aberdeen’s 17-year-old
  midfielder – a relative unknown for whom no media outlet seems to have a
  forename. Last, Unai Emery’s quest for an error-prone centre-back devoid of
  pace and power has finally reached its conclusion: Villa are also close to
  signing Victor Lindelöf, available on a free transfer after running down his
  contract at Manchester United, for whom he was somehow granted 284
  appearances. For context, Jaap Stam was moved on after 79. Elsewhere,
  Tottenham hope to convince Ademola Lookman, who’s had enough of being publicly
  shamed by Gian Piero Gasperini, that what he really needs instead is to have
  Daniel Levy control his career prospects. Bayern Munich are also keen on the
  player, but the lure of Europa League football will surely trump fripperies
  like winning big trophies and generally enjoying life. On the other hand,
  Spurs are keen to relieve themselves of Yves Bissouma, with Galatasaray
  interested – as they appear to be in every footballer potentially changing
  clubs. This one, though, may have no better option – even Ederson looks set
  for Fenerbahce – provided he can get there in time, which can by no means be
  taken for granted. For their part, Bayern definitely won’t be taking Nicolas
  Jackson, originally scheduled to be joining them on loan for the season. After
  an injury to Liam Delap, there is now a vacancy on the Stamford Bridge bench
  for a striker who rarely strikes, so a player kicked out has then been forced
  back against his will in a move of typical compassion and integrity; as a
  result, the German club have withdrawn their interest. In other centre-forward
  news, the window wouldn’t be complete without Newcastle’s name in the frame
  for one. Having been turned down by Delap, João Pedro, Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin
  Sesko, Kevin Kyle, Billy Dane, Ian Olney, Ian Ormondroyd, Stuart Barlow, Terry
  Gibson, Sean Dundee and Plug from Bash Street Kids, they now plan to loan
  Ukrainian totem pole Artem Dovbyk from Roma and perhaps pinch Yoane Wissa off
  Brentford. Finally for this window and, as we all choke back the tears, one
  shard of hope: there are just 102 shopping days until the next shopping day.
  Together, we’ll get through them.
