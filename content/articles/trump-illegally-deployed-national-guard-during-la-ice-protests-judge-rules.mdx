  The Trump administration illegally deployed thousands of national guard troops
  in Los Angeles earlier this summer amid widespread protests against its
  immigration enforcement actions, a federal judged said on Tuesday. Judge
  Charles Breyer ruled in a case brought by the state of California that Donald
  Trump’s administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany
  federal agents on raids. In the order, set to take effect on 12 September,
  Breyer cited the president’s threats to send national guard troops to other
  cities across the country, “thus creating a national police force with the
  president as its chief”. In a statement, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,
  praised the court’s ruling as a win for democracy and constitutional limits on
  presidential power, declaring: “No president is a king — not even Trump.” On
  social media, he marked the legal win with a Trumpian-style post: “DONALD
  TRUMP LOSES AGAIN,” adding, “The courts agree – his militarization of our
  streets and use of the military against US citizens is ILLEGAL.” Anna Kelly, a
  White House spokesperson, dismissed the ruling as judicial overreach and
  accused a “rogue judge” of trying to “usurp” Trump’s authority to respond to
  unrest and violence in American cities. “President Trump saved Los Angeles,
  which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he
  stepped in,” Kelly said in a statement, vowing the legal fight was not over.
  The administration was expected to appeal the decision. The decision stems
  from a lawsuit filed by Newsom in June, arguing that troops sent to Los
  Angeles in June were violating a law prohibiting use of US military troops to
  participate in domestic law enforcement. At the time, Newsom called Trump’s
  actions an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism”. Lawyers for Trump’s
  administration have argued the law in question – known as the Posse Comitatus
  Act, passed by Congress in 1878 – does not apply because the troops were
  protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws. Breyer – who was appointed to
  the federal bench by former president Bill Clinton’s Democratic administration
  – ruled the deployment violated the 1878 law. He paused his order until
  Friday, allowing time for the Trump administration to appeal his decision.
  “This was intentional – Defendants instigated a months-long deployment of the
  National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles for the purpose of establishing a
  military presence there and enforcing federal law. Such conduct is a serious
  violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer wrote in the judgment. In his
  ruling, Breyer did not order the withdrawal of the remaining troops, but
  barred the Pentagon from ordering troops to engage in “arrests, apprehensions,
  searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot
  control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants”. About
  300 troops remain on the streets of LA, down from the thousands of guard
  members and hundreds of marines sent by the Trump administration in June.
  Following Breyer’s decision, Newsom on Tuesday filed a preliminary injunction
  seeking to block the Trump administration’s extension of the soldiers’
  deployment through the November election. Citing the ruling, the governor
  argued: “There was never a need and there is not a need now for soldiers to be
  deployed against their communities.” The case comes as the Trump
  administration is executing a broad crackdown on immigration and has targeted
  Democratic-run cities, threatening the use of the national guard and
  increasing the number of federal agents involved in operations. Trump has
  already deployed the guard as part of his unprecedented law enforcement
  takeover in Washington DC, where the US president has direct legal control.
  And in recent days the president has ramped up his threats of further national
  guard deployments in Chicago, Baltimore, New York, San Francisco and Oakland.
  “Usurping local law enforcement and militarizing our cities erodes public
  trust and jeopardizes public safety,” the California attorney general, Rob
  Bonta, told reporters on Tuesday. “Trump has made it clear that southern
  California was round one.” Bonta said Breyer’s ruling should make the
  president “think twice” about sending troops into other American cities,
  vowing: “If Trump repeats this play, so will we.” Trump’s decision to deploy
  national guard troops into Los Angeles, against the wishes of state and local
  officials, sent shock waves through American politics. Newsom, and other
  Democratic leaders have sharply criticized the move, describing it as an
  alarming abuse of power. Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 national guard
  troops in June after two days of clashes between demonstrators and US
  immigration authorities. The decision marked a swift escalation in a broad
  immigration crackdown following raids across the country, which have triggered
  protests. Trump’s federalization of guard troops was the first time a US
  president had used such power since the 1992 LA riots, when widespread
  violence broke out in reaction to the acquittal of four white police officers
  for brutally beating the Black motorist Rodney King. Notably, the request to
  federalize the national guard troops in 1992 came at the behest of the
  governor and mayor, in stark contrast to Trump’s unilateral decision this
  summer, when there was nowhere near the same degree of unrest in LA. Trump did
  it again on 11 August, ordering more than 2,200 soldiers from states including
  Mississippi and Louisiana to Washington DC after his declaration of a “crime
  emergency” in the US capital. The US Department of Transportation also assumed
  management of Union Station, Washington’s main railway terminal, from Amtrak,
  citing safety concerns and infrastructure needs. The Associated Press
