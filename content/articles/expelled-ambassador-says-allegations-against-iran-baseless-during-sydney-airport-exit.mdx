  Iran’s former ambassador to Australia – now persona non grata – has denied
  allegations his government was behind two antisemitic arson attacks in
  Australia, describing the accusations as “baseless” as he left the country.
  Ahmad Sadeghi faced media questioning at Sydney airport before boarding a
  flight out of Australia. On Tuesday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese,
  said Iran’s paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was ultimately
  behind two antisemitic arson attacks last year: one on the Lewis Continental
  Kitchen in Bondi and another on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. There
  were no injuries in either attack. The federal government has expelled Sadeghi
  – the first such expulsion since the second world war – and will move to
  proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. There was no accusation
  current Iranian diplomats or embassy staff were involved. Sadeghi described
  Australia’s accusations as “baseless allegations” and reiterated that Iran has
  a large Jewish community – seeking to counter criticism that Iran has long
  sponsored antisemitic attacks overseas via proxy forces. Sadeghi said that the
  Australian Security Intelligence Organisation assessment that Iranian
  government officials were ultimately responsible for the arson attacks was the
  result of a “misunderstanding between Australia and Iran”. He also proffered
  that the allegation had likely emerged from a “conspiracy against our friendly
  relations with Australia”. Sadeghi insisted that, despite the tumult of his
  departure, he had enjoyed his posting in Canberra. “I love Australian people,”
  he said. Asio said it had “credible intelligence” that the IRGC was ultimately
  behind the arson attacks – planning and funding the attacks through a series
  of intermediaries, including organised crime figures – but said it was
  “likely” Iran was behind more anti-semitic attacks on Australian soil.
  Following the expulsion of the ambassador, community leaders have said
  Australians of Iranian heritage face verbal abuse and intimidation. The local
  diaspora had been asking for the ambassador’s expulsion since 2022, following
  the regime’s crackdown on the women’s rights movement, the Australian Iranian
  Society of Victoria vice president, Kambiz Razmara, said. He said there had
  been reports Australia’s Iranian community was being conflated with the
  actions of Iranian authorities. “It is important for people to recognise that
  we, the Iranian diaspora, are opposed to what happens in Iran,” Razmara said.
  “The Iranian diaspora, by and large, are here because they’re seeking freedom
  and social cohesion and freedom of expression and democracy, so anything that
  tarnishes that we are resolutely against.” The government had taken the right
  step after Iran’s “insidious, underhanded” work in destabilising Australian
  society, said David Andrews from the National Security College at the
  Australian National University. On Australia’s relationship with Iran, Andrews
  said Canberra had in the past been able to conduct diplomacy on behalf of its
  friends and allies who did not have a mission in Tehran. “(The expulsion)
  potentially puts that role at some risk,” he said. Australia should expect
  some retaliation. “The risk of people being used as political pawns, or people
  who have either dual citizenship or Australians passing through Iran, could be
  used as a point of leverage or sort of in response to this action,” Andrews
  said. “There’s no one who will be rushing to try and repair those ties too
  actively.” It’s estimated that between 3000 and 4000 Australians, or dual
  Australian-Iranian citizens, live in Iran. The Australian government has
  current a do not travel warning for Iran warning Australian citizens they
  could be subject to arbitrary detention.
