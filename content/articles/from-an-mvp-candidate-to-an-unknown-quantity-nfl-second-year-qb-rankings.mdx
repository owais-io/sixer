  Caleb Williams, Chicago Bears 2024 stats: 3,541 yards, 62.5% completion
  percentage, 20 passing touchdowns, six interceptions, 27th in EPA/play.
  Williams entered the NFL with enormous hype. He was supposed to be a
  franchise-altering quarterback, a one-man offense who could spin magic out of
  the mundane. Instead, his rookie season fell flat. Chicago drafted him No 1
  overall and then plopped him into an ill-fitting roster with an ill-fitting
  scheme. To compound things, the Bears overloaded Williams with too much, too
  soon and he spent much of the year looking frazzled. There was plenty of blame
  to go around: receivers quit on the offense (at one point mid-play), the
  offensive line was brutal and there was no supporting run game. By the
  midpoint of the season, the players’ body language was so poor that the O-line
  barely pretended to care when Williams was crushed. Still, the rookie wasn’t
  blameless. Williams swung between hyper-aggressive and ultra-conservative. The
  creativity that defined his game in college vanished. Early in the season, he
  bailed from clean pockets, hoping to extend plays; later, he stayed glued to
  the top of his drops, as though he was trying to deconstruct pre-draft
  narratives about his instinctual style in real-time. Neither extreme worked.
  Williams did show progress late in the year, playing with better rhythm in a
  more structured set-up, but his accuracy was still erratic. Among starting
  QBs, only Anthony Richardson was more inaccurate on unpressured throws from
  the pocket. Enter Ben Johnson. The former Lions offensive coordinator has been
  the most sought-after head coach for two cycles. He rejected multiple job
  offers before finally taking the Bears gig, betting his career on Williams.
  It’s not just Johnson, either. For the third straight year, the Bears have
  been crowned offseason champs (hang the banners!). Chicago overhauled their
  offensive line, trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signing
  center Drew Dalman in free agency. They added Ozzy Trapilo in the second round
  of the draft, and he is in contention to start at left tackle. It’s a solid
  haul, but there are caveats. Jackson was a bust in LA, his career derailed by
  injuries. Thuney has been one of the league’s best guards for a decade, but he
  turns 33 in November and he showed signs of ageing last season. Dalman is a
  run-game specialist who has been exposed in pass protection. If the trio click
  early, they will help fuel Johnson’s rushing attack, the bedrock of Johnson’s
  offense, but it could easily go the other way. And there are still fair
  questions about how Johnson will build a passing game to fit Williams. In
  Detroit, Johnson built a rhythm-based attack around Jared Goff. That’s not
  Williams’ natural game. He is a creator, wired to hold the ball and extend
  plays. Finding a balance between Johnson’s systematized approach and Williams’
  freewheeling style will be a challenge. Adjustments should flow in both
  directions: Johnson loosening his approach; Williams speeding up his play in
  the pocket. Early training camp reports, though, have not been encouraging.
  Johnson hasn’t decluttered the Bears’ offense. He’s added even more to the
  quarterback’s plate, dumping his entire offense on Williams and asking him to
  play catch-up. That’s the same approach last year’s staff took, and it was a
  dud. Johnson was hired to trigger a quick turnaround for Williams and the
  Bears, but the partnership may take a year to come together. Williams remains
  an electric talent. Johnson is one of the best offensive architects of his
  generation. The potential peak is a Mahomes-Reid-like fusion of ideas. But the
  teething issues could be gnarly until the duo find a middle-ground approach
  that works. Confidence meter: 5/10 – Banking on Johnson. Jayden Daniels,
  Washington Commanders 2024 stats: 3,568 yards, 69% completion percentage, 25
  passing touchdowns, nine interceptions, eighth in EPA/play Daniels put
  together the finest rookie quarterback season in modern league history,
  carrying the Commanders to an NFC Championship game. Nothing about last year
  was a fluke. He cracked everything opposing defenses threw his way, torching
  the blitz and shredding complex coverage rotations. At times, Daniels was a
  one-man offense, an explosive play waiting to happen, whether through the air
  or on the ground. He also mastered pro-level nuances and refused to make dumb
  mistakes, finishing the season with 1.7% turnover-worthy play percentage,
  second only to Lamar Jackson. The Commanders recognize they have something
  special and spent the offseason trying to fast-track their championship
  timeline. That’s a laudable strategy, but the particulars are fuzzy. They bet
  on household names, acquiring Laremy Tunsil and Deebo Samuel in offseason
  trades to give Daniels more protection and firepower. But both of the new
  arrivals are at iffy stages of their careers: Tunsil didn’t play up to his
  reputation in Houston last season; Samuel is a unicorn, but injuries have
  slowed him down. The team mirrored the strategy on defense, bringing in older
  vets (Von Miller, Will Harris, Eddie Goldman) to try to push them over the
  top. Now, Washington have the oldest roster in the NFL despite having one of
  the best young quarterbacks in the league. You can quibble with the
  Commanders’ medium-term outlook, but the roster is stronger this season than
  last. Tunsil, for all his faults last season, is a clear upgrade at left
  tackle. If the team can box off a contract extension for Terry McLaurin, they
  will have plenty of weapons for Daniels to work with. Even if the team
  regress, we have seen enough from Daniels to know he will be a perennial MVP
  contender. Confidence meter: 10/10 – we’re gonna need a bigger scale. Drake
  Maye, New England Patriots 2024 stats: 2,276 yards, 66.6% completion
  percentage, 15 passing touchdowns, 10 interceptions, 20th in EPA/play Maye was
  dealt the roughest hand of any rookie quarterback last season. He was dropped
  on a barren roster, playing for a head coach who was in over his head. Given
  the circumstances, Maye was outstanding. There were flashes of the Justin
  Herbert-esque quarterback he could be: An efficient, downfield bomber who can
  move the chains with his legs, so long as he kicks his addiction to fumbles.
  The surface numbers were fine. But the under-the-hood figures were more
  encouraging. He finished the year 20th in EPA/play, ranking third among the
  rookies and ahead of more established starters. He also finished with 2.8%
  completion percentage over expectation, which sounds small but put him 11th in
  the league, above Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. This season,
  the arrow is pointing up. Mike Vrabel is now the Pats’ head coach. Josh
  McDaniels is back calling plays. Professionalism is back in the building. The
  front office invested heavily and smartly to upgrade the offense, adding
  Stefon Diggs, rookie receiver Kyle Williams, veteran linemen Morgan Moses and
  Garrett Bradbury, and two linemen drafted in the top three rounds, including
  left tackle Will Campbell. Even with the additions, the Patriots’ offensive
  line lacks experience and difference-makers. But it’s in a stronger place than
  when Maye walked into the huddle a year ago. The receiver room is also
  improved, running eight deep, with recent draft picks Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon
  Baker unlikely to make the regular season roster. With those improvements
  around him, Maye is the most likely quarterback to take the Year Two leap.
  Confidence meter: 7/10 – finally working with some pros. Michael Penix Jr,
  Atlanta Falcons 2024 stats: 775 yards, 58.1% completion percentage, three
  passing touchdowns, three interceptions The sample size is tiny. But in three
  starts, Penix justified last offseason’s contentious investment. Atlanta
  drafted Penix No 8 overall, three months after signing Kirk Cousins in free
  agency to a three-year, $180m fully guaranteed deal. At the time,
  double-dipping on quarterbacks felt foolish. And given that Cousins arrived in
  Atlanta fully cooked, it still feels foolish. But with Cousins’ decline and a
  so-so draft intake, picking up a quarterback with Penix’s potential has proven
  to be a savvy move. Watching Cousins last year was miserable. He couldn’t
  move. His throws had no juice. Strip off the nameplate, and the Falcons had a
  quarterback struggling to operate a functional NFL offense. Atlanta’s OC, Zac
  Robinson, was forced to scrap elements of his offense to try to hide Cousins’
  physical shortcomings. It took only one drive for Penix to show the promise of
  Atlanta’s offense. Unlike Cousins, Penix has a rapid release and a hose for an
  arm. He immediately allowed the Falcons to expand the playbook and showed some
  veteran craft in the pocket. He navigated muddy pockets, extended plays when
  he could and manipulated defenders with his eyes, spraying the ball to all
  levels of the field. For all the positives, Penix’s accuracy remains a
  concern. He posted one of the highest uncatchable pass rates of the season
  (34.4%) in Week 17, a lingering issue from his days in college. But there was
  enough upside to fill fans with confidence that he can be, at worst, a
  league-average starter – and that alone would be an improvement for the
  Falcons. Atlanta’s offense is oozing with potential. Drake London is an
  All-Pro-caliber receiver. With Kyle Pitts, Casey Washington and Ray-Ray
  McCloud, they have a good cast of supplementary pass-catchers. Bijan Robinson
  and Tyler Allgeier are one of the best backfield tandems in the league. The
  offensive line is solid, if unspectacular. The ceiling of the group will come
  down to Penix’s development. Confidence meter: 6/10 – who doesn’t love a
  rocket-armed lefty? JJ McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings 2024 stats: N/A McCarthy is
  this season’s mystery box. He missed his entire rookie season with a knee
  injury and stood on the sidelines as Sam Darnold rejuvenated his career,
  showing what’s possible in Kevin O’Connell’s offense. This year’s Vikings
  roster is deeper and more talented than the group that won 14 games last
  season, putting McCarthy in an ideal spot for a first-year starter. The
  offensive line is improved, he has a game-breaker at receiver, a top-10 tight
  end, a decent rushing attack, an offensive guru for a head coach and a
  hellacious defense that should provide plenty of short fields. Pushing deep
  into the playoffs should be the expectation in Minnesota; the roster is too
  loaded, the coaching staff too good to miss this opportunity. But that’s a ton
  of pressure to lay at the door of a quarterback who is effectively a rookie.
  If he does nothing else but limit turnovers, McCarthy should pilot the Vikings
  to double-digit wins. If he can prove to be more of a playmaker, which he
  showed in bursts at Michigan, he can elevate the offense beyond what Darnold
  produced last season. Confidence meter: 5/10 – too many unknowns. Bo Nix,
  Denver Broncos 2024 stats: 3,775 yards, 66.3% completion percentage, 29
  passing touchdowns, 12 interceptions, 19th in EPA/play Last year, Nix and Sean
  Payton silenced the bozos (this writer included) who rolled their eyes at
  Denver drafting him in the first round. Anyone doubting Nix at this point is
  likely holding on to priors. Is he as physically gifted as Williams, Daniels,
  or Maye? No. But entering his second season, Nix has checked off more boxes
  than all but Daniels. As a rookie, Nix was efficient, accurate and decisive.
  He was fortunate to be playing behind one of the league’s best offensive
  lines, but he quickly mastered Payton’s richly layered offense and took
  advantage of his environment. Early on, the Broncos sheltered Nix. That made
  sense. Even as an older rookie – he entered the league as a 24-year-old –
  Nix’s feel in the pocket was off, and he struggled to rev up to the speed of
  the league. But by the midseason, Payton had ripped the training wheels off,
  and Nix demolished any pre-draft notions about his game. He started
  manipulating defenses rather than reacting to them. He challenged the middle
  of the field. He ripped heaters into tight coverage. Over the second half of
  the season, Nix finished sixth in adjusted completion percentage on throws of
  20 yards or more, outpacing Herbert, Jackson and Joe Burrow. He cut down on
  negative plays, posting the best rookie pressure-to-sack rate at 13% (elite
  quarterbacks typically hover around 10%). Pre-draft, Nix was billed as a
  system quarterback, one who would rely on making quick, decisive reads,
  accuracy and not turning the ball over. Those traits still define his game.
  But he showed in the second half of his rookie year that he is more than a cog
  in Payton’s machine. If Nix can build on his rookie campaign, the Broncos will
  have legitimate title aspirations. Confidence meter: 8/10 – Nix can anchor a
  franchise.
