  A search was under way after a woman was swept into a flooded creek in the
  Hunter region overnight, as heavy downpours continued to batter large parts of
  northern New South Wales. Police said a Mini was being driven by a 27-year-old
  woman in Rothbury, near Cessnock, when it became stuck in a swollen creek on
  Old North Road just before 8pm on Saturday. The woman and a passenger, a woman
  aged 26, tried to flee the vehicle but were both swept into flood waters.
  “Both the driver and the passenger door were opened,” Supt Steve Laksa told
  reporters on Sunday. “[The women have] exited the vehicle and at this time
  they were … swept into the causeway. At this time the driver of the vehicle
  has managed to come to the surface and also at the time gather her dog that
  was also accompanying them in the vehicle, and made her way to the bank of the
  causeway. “At this time it was reported that the passenger … was not located.”
  Police said both women were Chinese nationals who were in Australia on working
  visas. The missing woman is an engineer who has been working in the country
  for more than three years. When emergency services workers arrived, they also
  found a 40-year-old man stuck in a tree nearby, after he also apparently
  became trapped in the rising water. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The man
  was swept back into the creek during a first attempted rescue by the State
  Emergency Service; he was pulled from the water after rescuers tracked him
  along Black Creek. Police, emergency services and firefighters were to resume
  a search for the missing woman on Sunday. Warnings remained in place for
  several regions – including the Coffs coast, mid-north coast, Upper Hunter and
  New England regions – after several days of heavy rain. Forecasters were
  warning that rain would continue and that parts of the Hunter and the north
  coast would be hit by potentially damaging winds. Power was cut to at least
  27,500 homes in NSW, as snow was recorded in some parts of the state and even
  across the Queensland border. Between 50mm and 100mm of rain drenched parts of
  the mid-north coast and northern Hunter on Saturday. The SES said it had
  responded to more than 1,455 calls related to rainfall, thunderstorms and
  snow. A new low-pressure system was expected to push up the NSW coast on
  Sunday with conditions likely to ease by the afternoon, the Bureau of
  Meteorology said. Residents in parts of Scone and Taree were asked to evacuate
  amid a major flood threat. “Most of these damaging wind gusts will be driven
  by showers and thunderstorms,” said a meteorologist, Miriam Bradbury.
  Authorities were warning surfers, fishers, swimmers and boating enthusiasts to
  stay clear of the coast amid dangerous swells. The warnings came as
  unprecedented snowfall was recorded around Armidale and Guyra on Saturday
  afternoon, creating dangerous road conditions. The SES responded to more than
  100 vehicles stuck in snow on New England Highway, Waterfall Way, Norris Drive
  and Grafton Road. More than 1,100 volunteers were responding throughout the
  state, while helicopters and high-clearance vehicles were deployed to affected
  areas. – with Australian Associated Press
