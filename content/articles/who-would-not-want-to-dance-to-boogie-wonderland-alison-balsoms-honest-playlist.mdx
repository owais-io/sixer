  The first song I fell in love with When I was seven and I started playing the
  trumpet, my mum would take me to the library. They just happened to have Afro
  by Dizzy Gillespie, and I fell in love with Con Alma, which Dizzy plays on the
  trumpet with so much soul that it feels like a voice. I remember thinking:
  Wow, this is something else. The song I do at karaoke I can recognise the
  melodies in most songs because I have the ear of a musician. But I don’t
  really listen to the words – I feel having the words in front of me would
  throw me off, so I’ve never done karaoke. If I had to, I’d probably do an old
  classic like Crocodile Rock by Elton John. The song I inexplicably know every
  lyric to My whole family has always loved Queen. When Queen played Knebworth
  in 1986, my granny and grandad lived in the village, so we felt like they’d
  come to play to us. My mum, dad, aunty and uncle all went. We were left
  behind, but could hear it across the fields. If we were on a long car journey,
  I’d insist on having it on five times in a row. The best song to play at a
  party I went to see Earth, Wind &amp; Fire as a teenager and was amazed by
  their horn section – the Phenix Horns. Who would not want to dance to Boogie
  Wonderland? It’s a classic dancefloor boogie moment. The song I’ve always
  hated I don’t know why I hate Merry Xmas Everybody by Slade so much. Maybe
  it’s because you can’t get away from it. It reminds me of late-night desperate
  Christmas shopping when everyone’s run out of time. The song that makes me cry
  Iestyn Davies singing Rodelinda by Handel with the English National Opera.
  Davies has the most beautiful countertenor voice and is one of the greatest
  opera singers in the world. It’s a ravishing recording and I feel privileged
  that he’s my friend. The song I’d like played at my funeral I argue with my
  manager: what is the ultimate, greatest piece of all time? She says Mozart’s
  Requiem; I say Bach’s St Matthew Passion. They are both masterpieces. So I’ll
  have both – even if it does make the funeral seven hours long. Alison Balsom
  features on Last Night of the Proms on Saturday 13 September, Radio 3 from
  7pm, BBC Two from 6.55pm and BBC One from 8.30pm.
