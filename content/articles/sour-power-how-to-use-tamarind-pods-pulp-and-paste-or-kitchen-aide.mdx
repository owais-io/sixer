  Can you please explain tamarind? Pods, pulp, paste, concentrate … I can’t keep
  up with them all. David, via email How does Chaya Maya, development chef at
  Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, love tamarind? Let her count the ways: “It’s
  delicious, plus you can use it in sweet and savoury dishes, or to make
  lemonade, which we do in Mauritius; it has that sour sharpness that makes your
  mouth tingle. Actually, we need a tamarind movement.” Also in favour of the
  pucker fruit is Melissa Thompson, author of Motherland, namely for its “lovely
  consistency” and ability to “coat things nicely” while adding “depth”. As
  David says, tamarind comes in various forms, but let’s start at the very
  beginning with those peanut-shaped pods, which Thompson likes to snack on –
  just crack open the shell and eat the flesh. “When I started cheffing, I
  wanted to do all the processes myself, so I’d buy a box of pods, peel them,
  soak them and mash them, which took so long!” Perhaps unsurprisingly, these
  days she prefers a compressed block, which also happens to be Maya’s go-to:
  “You have to hydrate it, then make a paste, but the blocks last longer, plus
  the manufacturer will have waited until the tamarind is ripe, so it’s sweet
  and caramelly.” Perfect, then, for Thompson’s barbecue sauce, which involves
  breaking off 50g pulp, steeping it in water and combining with apple molasses,
  but the possibilities are (almost) endless: “A block is the most versatile
  option, but only for someone who gets through a lot.” Perhaps easier is a jar
  of paste, which is readily available in supermarkets, or tamarind concentrate.
  “Depending on where it’s from [predominantly Thailand and India], it tastes
  quite different, which can cause confusion,” says Feast’s own Helen Goh, whose
  first solo book, Baking and the Meaning of Life, is out in September. “I only
  ever use Thai or Malaysian tamarind, which is fruity, bright, smooth, liquidy
  and brown; Indian tamarind, by contrast, is darker, almost black, and far more
  concentrated and intense.” Add a spoonful for instant oomph in soups, stews,
  meat marinades or anywhere you might otherwise turn to citrus. “It’s not quite
  the same as a block, but it’s still pretty delicious,” Maya says. “Just watch
  out when seasoning, because the jarred stuff is often already salted.” She
  suggests adding lime juice to loosen, then flavouring with crushed garlic,
  chopped spring onion and fresh chilli, plus salt and sugar to taste. “Roast
  some fish, pour on the tamarind mix and it’s the best. If you’ve got crispy
  onions, pile them on top as well.” Thompson, meanwhile, would use her noodle:
  “Make a dressing by watering down tamarind paste, add vinegar, honey, chopped
  shallot, garlic, lime juice and zest, and pour over a cold noodle salad.”
  Pineapple and tamarind are synonymous with Malaysia, where Goh grew up, and
  she says that duo are particularly welcome in an upside-down cake: “Tamarind
  concentrate goes into the caramel,which is poured into a cake tin. Lay
  pineapple on top, pour in the cake batter, then bake – it melts into a gooey,
  syrupy thing that I love.” There’s also tamarind extract, but Thompson would
  be inclined to leave that well alone: “People tend to come unstuck with that
  because it is so concentrated.” That said, it works a dream in vegan fish
  sauce, which is yet more proof that sweet-sour tamarind really does make
  everything better. Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com
