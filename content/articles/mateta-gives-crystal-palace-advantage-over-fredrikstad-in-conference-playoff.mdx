  It might not be the Europa League. But even the absence of Eberechi Eze as he
  closes in on his £67.5m move to Arsenal could not spoil Crystal Palace’s first
  taste of European football as they sealed a victory in the first leg of their
  Conference League playoff. After a summer of uncertainty over which
  competition they would play in, the last thing that Oliver Glasner would have
  wanted was to receive a call from Eze on the morning of the game informing the
  Palace manager that he was not feeling well enough to play. Yet having
  struggled to break down well-drilled Norwegian side Fredrikstad in the first
  half in the absence of their talismanic England forward, Jean-Philippe
  Mateta’s goal calmed Palace’s nerves, even if they could not find a second
  that could have proved crucial as Palace attempt to secure their place in the
  group stages of Uefa’s third-tier competition. Glasner, who led Eintracht
  Frankfurt to victory in the Europa League in 2022, will know that this tie is
  far from over given that they must play the second leg next week on an
  artificial surface. Nothing is ever certain when it comes to Palace. Glasner
  could not hide his disappointment beforehand that Eze would not feature,
  admitting that it had disrupted his side’s preparations. “It is not what you
  want to do, to change the starting XI on matchday, especially in this
  situation – the first time in European football for Crystal Palace,” he said
  before kick-off. Despite the lingering feeling of disappointment of not being
  able to take up their place in the Europa League, there was still a sense of
  anticipation on the streets of south London beforehand. The Conference League
  anthem was widely booed as the Palace ultras behind the goal immediately
  struck up their chant that takes aim at Uefa, former part-owner John Textor
  and the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis – all of whom have been
  blamed for their controversial demotion to this competition for breaking
  multi-club ownership regulations. Strictly speaking, Palace have played in
  Europe before but it was in the long forgotten Intertoto Cup in 1998 when they
  qualified because they were the only English team to apply for entry. That
  adventure lasted only two matches in 4-0 aggregate defeat against Turkish side
  Samsunspor and having been eliminated in a playoff while in charge of
  Wolfsburg, Glasner was clearly taking no chances here. Justin Devenny – who
  scored the winning penalty in the Community Shield victory – struggled after
  being handed the unenviable task of replacing Eze, although the Croatia
  defender Borna Sosa impressed on his full debut. Fredrikstad, who capped their
  first season back in Norway’s top flight since 2012 by winning their domestic
  cup competition, lined up with five at the back and came ready to defend. They
  could even have snatched an equaliser when substitute Henrik Skogvold dragged
  his shot wide in injury-time. Without Eze to inspire them, it took Palace time
  to find their feet against a side that are more than half way through their
  league campaign and will have the weekend off before the second leg. Mateta
  finally forced goalkeeper Martin Børsheim into a save after 20 minutes but
  otherwise the vociferous group of travelling supporters had reason to feel
  encouraged. A speculative shot that flew way off target from Marc Guéhi –
  another Palace player whose future is uncertain – summed up the hosts’
  frustration. The swaggering Adam Wharton looked like their most likely
  creative source from his deeper midfield role, although it was from a corner
  that Mateta was able to swivel and strike the post. That seemed to wake Palace
  up and Ismaïla Sarr’s header moments later was just about scrambled away to
  safety. Glasner did not seem happy as he strode down the tunnel. His side
  emerged with renewed purpose for the second half and Devenny headed over a
  golden opportunity from Guéhi’s cross. But, to the home crowd’s relief, they
  finally found the breakthrough when Mateta cleverly redirected a wayward
  volley from Will Hughes. Sosa could have extended their lead but he fired just
  over after good work from Sarr, with Glasner turning to the out-of-favour
  Odsonne Édouard to replace Devenny as they went on the attack. Daniel Muñoz
  hit the post from Jefferson Lerma’s cross and Guéhi headed wide from a corner
  but Fredrikstad’s defence was able to hold firm. The lack of alternatives from
  the bench – Romain Esse, the 20-year-old who cost around £12m from Millwall in
  January was surprisingly not called upon here – will only strengthen Glasner’s
  case for reinforcements before the transfer window closes, as he made his
  feelings clear after the game. But after the disruption of the last few days,
  Palace will still be strong favourites to finish the job next week.
