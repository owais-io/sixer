  is ‘a serious danger’ – business live

  The number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers jumped to a six-month
  high in July, according to Bank of England figures. Some 65,352 mortgage
  approvals for house purchases were recorded in July, which is the highest
  total since January when 65,775 home loans were approved. However, there was
  also a drop in the value of new mortgages approved in July – it fell by £900m
  to £4.5bn, having jumped to £5.4bn in June. The Bank also reports that the
  ‘effective’ interest rate on new mortgages decreased for the fifth consecutive
  month, to 4.28% in July from 4.34% in June. However, the rate on the
  outstanding stock of mortgages remained at 3.88%. Donald Trump is trying to
  send a clear message to the Federal Reserve by attempting to fire Lisa Cook,
  says Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, chief economist at global financial services firm
  Ebury “Lisa Cook’s attempted firing by Trump is likely to be a long legal
  process. While the short term impact is limited, the message being sent to
  other Fed governors is unmistakable. “Long term rates are the key for Trump,
  as they drive mortgage rates and hence the housing markets, and these remain
  stubbornly high even as expectations for rate cuts grow.” The head of the
  European Central Bank has warned that the global economy could be rocked by
  Donald Trump’s shake-up of America’s central bank. Steps by US President
  Donald Trump to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or Fed governor
  Lisa Cook would represent a “very serious danger for the US economy and the
  world economy”, said ECB president Christine Lagarde said today. Lagarde told
  Radio Classique: “If U.S. monetary policy were no longer independent and
  instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe that
  the effect on the balance of the American economy could, as a result of the
  effects this would have around the world, be very worrying, because it is the
  largest economy in the world.” Last week, lawyers representing Cook accused
  Trump of using unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud as his “weapon of
  choice” to attack the Federal Reserve’s independence, after the president
  announced he was firing her. Lagarde also told Radio Classique that a ruling
  on Friday by a US appeals court that most of Donald Trump’s tariffs were
  illegal were adding a “further layer of uncertainty” to the global economic
  outlook. Trump has repeatedly blasted Powell for the Fed’s failure to cut US
  interest rates this year, and is expected to appoint a successor with a more
  dovish approach. Unemployment across the eurozone has dropped to its record
  low this summer. New data from statistics body Eurostat show that euro area
  seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped to 6.2% in July, down from 6.3%
  in June 2025 and from 6.4% in July 2024. Eurostat estimates that there were
  13.025m people unemployed in the European Union, including 10.8m in the euro
  area. In July, unemployment decreased by 165,000 in the EU and by 170,000 in
  the euro area. Analysts at ING say: Falling unemployment suggests that the
  eurozone economy remains resilient in the face of global uncertainty. Modest
  economic growth seems realistic for the coming quarters, as the strong labour
  market should aid some domestic recovery Manufacturing supply chains also
  remained stretched in August. Today’s PMI report flags that the average wait
  to receive raw materials lengthened last month, due to a combination of
  shipping delays, vendor capacity issues, transportation re-routing to avoid
  the Red Sea and global material shortages. UK factories also reported they cut
  jobs for the tenth consecutive month. S&amp;P Global says: Lower employment
  was linked to weaker intakes of new work, tariff uncertainties and rising
  labour costs (particularly the ongoing impact of higher minimum wages and
  employer NICs). Ouch! The UK manufacturing sector shrank again last month, as
  factories were hit by weaker demand at home and abroad. The latest monthly
  poll of purchasing managers across Britain’s manufacturing sector found that
  new orders and new export business both fell at quicker rates in August,
  leading to another drop in production volumes. This pulled the S&amp;P Global
  UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index down to 47.0 in August, from
  July’s six-month high of 48.0. It’s the 11th month in a row in which the PMI
  has come in below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. UK factories blamed
  lower new work inflows to “subdued client confidence”, citing tariff
  uncertainties, and cost increases due to the rise in the minimum wage and
  employer national insurance rates. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global
  Market Intelligence, says: “Production volumes are still showing resilience in
  the face of global geopolitical uncertainty and US tariff policies, with both
  July and August having seen only slight contractions that were milder than
  those suffered earlier in the year. Business confidence has also lifted to a
  sixmonth high, reflecting hopes that the trading environment is starting to
  settle down. However, August also saw a steep drop in UK manufacturers’ new
  orders, with total order books and overseas demand both falling at some of the
  fastest rates seen over the past two years. Weak market conditions, US tariffs
  and downbeat client confidence all contributed to the dearth of new contract
  wins. Job cuts were also reported for a tenth successive month, with factory
  headcounts dropping to one of the greatest extents postpandemic. The outlook
  for the sector therefore clearly remains very uncertain. With manufacturers
  fearing that possible government policy decisions, including potential tax
  increases, could further hurt their competitiveness in domestic and export
  markets, the upcoming Budget will likely prove very important in guiding
  business confidence about the year ahead. Back in the manufacturing world,
  eurozone factory output growth has hit a 41-month high, as a long slump
  finally ended. Factory production growth across the eurozone was the strongest
  in nearly three-and-a-half years in August, data provider S&amp;P Global
  repoerts, despite the turmoil caused by Donald Trump’s trade war. European
  manufacturers reported that new orders rose, driven by domestic markets as new
  export sales fell for a second successive month. This lifted the HCOB Eurozone
  Manufacturing PMI back into growth territory. The index increased from 49.8 in
  July to 50.7 in August, showinng the first monthly improvement in operating
  conditions for eurzone goods producers since June 2022. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia,
  chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: “The economic recovery in
  the manufacturing sector is broadening, as conditions are improving in six out
  of the eight countries for which PMIs are recorded—compared to only four
  countries in the previous month. As a result, the Manufacturing PMI for the
  eurozone has crossed the expansion threshold for the first time since
  mid-2022, mainly because companies have ramped up production more rapidly.”
  Royal Mail’s parent company has posted a surge in profits, in its first
  financial results since being taken over by Czech billionaire Daniel
  Křetínský. International Distribution Services (IDS) has reported that pre-tax
  profits jumped to £429m in the year to 30 March 2025, up from £114m the
  previous year. On an adjusted operating profit basis, IDS recorded earnings of
  £278m for the last year, up from a loss of £28m in the previous year. This
  recovery in profits should cheer Křetínský, whose EP Group finalised the
  £3.6bn takeover of IDS this spring, and may harden suspicious that the Czech
  sphinx got the company at a bargain price. Martin Seidenberg, IDS’s chief
  executive, says: “It has been a year of change for IDS. Thanks to the hard
  work of our people and our investment in transformation, Royal Mail returned
  to profit for the first time in three years, marking an important milestone in
  the company’s turnaround. With IDS’s acquisition by EP Group complete and
  Universal Service reform decided now is the time for us to drive the business
  forward and capitalise on our momentum. IDS adds that Royal Mail
  “significantly improved its financial and operational performance”, and made
  an adjusted operating profit of £12m if you strip out voluntary redundancy
  costs. That’s its first profit in three years, following significant losses in
  2022-23 and 2023-24. IDS says: This is in line with guidance and was achieved
  despite an increasingly competitive and challenging trading environment. The
  company’s parcel delivery services, GLS, made an adjusted operating profit of
  £286m, a drop of £34m. IDS blamed the fall on “a challenging macroeconomic and
  regulatory environment in Germany and Italy and foreign exchange movements”.
  European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has weighed in on the crisis
  in France, saying that any risk of a government falling in the euro zone is
  “worrying”. Speaking to broadcaster Radio Classique, Lagarde said France is
  not currently in a situation that would need the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF) to intervene. But she insisted that fiscal discipline remained
  imperative in France, and that she was looking very attentively at the French
  bond spreads situation. The French government could collapse next week, when
  parliament hold a confidence vote over plans to slash public spending. The
  London stock market has begun the new month on the front foot. The FTSE 100
  index of blue-chip shares has gained 27 points, or 0.3%, to 9213 points.
  Defense firm BAE Systems are the top risers, up 2.8%, after Norway agreed a
  £10bn deal to buy Type 26 anti-submarine warships from the UK. They’ll be
  constructed at BAE’s shipyards in Glasgow. Back in the world of manufacturing,
  China’s electric carmaker BYD is feeling the pain from a domestic price war.
  Shares in BYD have fallen 4% today, after it reported a 30% drop in quarterly
  profits on Friday. BYD posted a net profit of 6.36 billion yuan ($891 million)
  in April-June last Friday, missing estimates of 7-9 billion yuan. BYD, which
  has overtaken Tesla for sales in Europe, also reported a rise in overseas
  sales, which helped push revenues up by 14%. Here’s some early reaction to the
  news that UK house prices dipped last month. Karen Noye, mortgage expert at
  Quilter, says affordability pressures are still weighing heavily on the
  housing market: “Last week’s property transaction figures pointed to
  relatively steady buyer demand, with July seeing 95,580 residential
  transactions – a 4% increase compared to the same month last year. However,
  the most recent inflation print has complicated the outlook for interest
  rates. Mortgage rates have been easing slightly but typical fixed deals remain
  around 4%, keeping monthly payments elevated, and higher inflation will make
  the path to lower interest rates even longer. “Speculation around potential
  reforms in the Chancellor’s upcoming budget, including possible levies on
  high-value homes or changes to capital gains tax on primary residences, could
  also cause hesitation among sellers. This would tighten supply further and
  paradoxically push prices higher, worsening conditions for new entrants to the
  market. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight
  Frank, agrees that speculation over budget tax changes could cool the market.
  “House prices have drifted lower since March as the market digests higher
  rates of stamp duty and supply continues to outstrip demand. Steady mortgage
  rates mean transaction numbers have improved over that time but the recent
  property tax speculation risks sending both sales and prices lower as buyers
  and sellers deal with pre-Budget uncertainty for the second year in a row.”
  Marc von Grundherr, director of estate agent Benham and Reeves, reckons the
  market will pick up in September…. “August’s marginal dip is no surprise, with
  the school holidays always proving disruptive for buyers and sellers. However,
  this is nothing more than a seasonal summer slump as our plans to move take a
  backseat in favour of holidays and longer days spent in the sun with family
  and friends. Now that September has arrived it brings with it a greater degree
  of normality where our day to day routines are concerned and so we should see
  momentum return quickly, with greater consistency in both market activity and
  house price growth.” Nationwide also expects income growth to continues to
  outpace house price growth. That would mean that housing affordability should
  continue to improve, if gradually. Their chief economist, Robert Gardner, says
  further cuts to UK interest could also help: Borrowing costs are likely to
  moderate a little further if Bank Rate is lowered again in the coming
  quarters. This should support buyer demand, especially since household balance
  sheets are strong and labour market conditions are expected to remain solid.
  We also start the new month with news that UK house prices fell last month.
  Lender Nationwide reports that the average UK house price dipped by 0.1% in
  August, surprising economists who had forecast a 0.2% rise. The average price
  of a property sold in the month dropped to £271,079, down from £272,664 in
  July. On an annual basis, house price inflation slowed to 2.1%, from 2.4% the
  previous month. In July, prices had jumped by 0.5% as the market recovered
  from a dip in June after the end of a tax break on stamp duty. In August,
  though, the market softened again. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief
  economist, says that high mortgage costs are weighing on the market: “The
  relatively subdued pace of house price growth is perhaps understandable, given
  that affordability remains stretched relative to long-term norms. House prices
  are still high compared to household incomes, making raising a deposit
  challenging for prospective buyers, especially given the intense cost of
  living pressures in recent years. “Combined with the fact that mortgage costs
  are more than three times the levels prevailing in the wake of the pandemic,
  this means that the cost of servicing a mortgage is also a barrier for many.
  Indeed, an average earner buying the typical first-time buyer property with a
  20% deposit faces a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to around 35% of their
  take-home pay, well above the long run average of 30%. Good morning, and
  welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the
  world economy. Factories across Asia-Pacific countries have been hit by a drop
  in activity last month, as Donald Trump’s trade wars hit demand. Surveys of
  purchasing managers from across the region, which are being released today,
  show that manufacturing output declined during August. In Japan, new export
  business contracted at the sharpest rate since March 2024, according to the
  latest survey from data provider S&amp;P Global. with factory activity
  shrinking again. The S&amp;P Global Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’
  Index rose to 49.7 in August, up from 48.9 in July, but still below the
  50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. Annabel Fiddes, economics
  associate director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said: The latest PMI
  data signalled that manufacturing conditions in Japan moved closer to
  stabilisation in August, helped by a softer fall in output. Demand conditions
  remained sluggish, however, with overall new work continuing to fall modestly.
  Of particular concern was a steeper drop in new export business, which fell at
  the sharpest pace in nearly a year and-a-half. In early August, Donald Trump
  latest swathe of country-specific tariffs came into effect, with Japan’s
  products now attracting a 15% levy. In South Korea, manufacturers have
  reported ‘sustained and solid reductions in output and new orders’ last month,
  which they blamed on a subdued domestic economy and global trade uncertainty.
  The S&amp;P Global South Korea Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index came
  in at 48.3 in August, up slightly from 48.0 in July, but showing the seventh
  successive month of worsening business conditions. Manufacturing conditions
  also continue to weaken in Taiwan, where goods producers reported sharp
  reductions in both output and new orders. Taiwanese manufacturers reported
  that customer demand had fallen both at home and overseas, and that
  uncertainty over US tariffs and the wider global economic climate also
  dampened confidence regarding the year-ahead. S&amp;P Global’s Annabel Fiddes
  reports: “The latest PMI data indicated that the performance of Taiwan’s
  manufacturing sector continued to be dampened by weak global demand conditions
  amid lingering uncertainty over US tariffs. Although firms signalled softer
  falls in output and new orders compared to July, rates of contraction remained
  historically marked overall, with businesses often noting that uncertainty
  over future US trade policy had led to greater hesitation among clients to
  commit to new projects. China, which is locked in negotiations over a trade
  deal with the US, also continued to suffer from tariff uncertainty. China’s
  manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in August, an
  official survey showed on Sunday, with its factory PMI rising to 49.4 from
  49.3 in July. The future of global trade was plunged into further uncertainty
  last week when the US court of appeals ruled that Donald Trump’s tariffs were
  unconstitutional, as the US president was not legally allowed to declare
  national emergencies and impose import taxes on other countries. This is
  likely to lead to a showdown at the Supreme Court. The agenda 7am BST:

In early August, Donald Trump latest swathe of country-specific tariffs came into effect, with Japan’s products now attracting a 15% levy. In South Korea, manufacturers have reported ‘sustained and solid reductions in output and new orders’ last month, which they blamed on a subdued domestic economy and global trade uncertainty. The S&amp;P Global South Korea Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index came in at 48.3 in August, up slightly from 48.0 in July, but showing the seventh successive month of worsening business conditions. Manufacturing conditions also continue to weaken in Taiwan, where goods producers reported sharp reductions in both output and new orders. Taiwanese manufacturers reported that customer demand had fallen both at home and overseas, and that uncertainty over US tariffs and the wider global economic climate also dampened confidence regarding the year-ahead. S&amp;P Global’s Annabel Fiddes reports: “The latest PMI data indicated that the performance of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector continued to be dampened by weak global demand conditions amid lingering uncertainty over US tariffs. Although firms signalled softer falls in output and new orders compared to July, rates of contraction remained historically marked overall, with businesses often noting that uncertainty over future US trade policy had led to greater hesitation among clients to commit to new projects. China, which is locked in negotiations over a trade deal with the US, also continued to suffer from tariff uncertainty. China’s manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in August, an official survey showed on Sunday, with its factory PMI rising to 49.4 from 49.3 in July. The future of global trade was plunged into further uncertainty last week when the US court of appeals ruled that Donald Trump’s tariffs were unconstitutional, as the US president was not legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on other countries. This is likely to lead to a showdown at the Supreme Court.
