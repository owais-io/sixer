  There is little like the anticipation of a new season, not knowing what will
  come, optimistic this could be your club’s year. Sheffield Wednesday fans have
  sold out the away end at Leicester on Sunday to watch their team take on a
  club recently mixing it with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City in the
  Premier League. The excitement should be building at Hillsborough but instead
  there is only worry and anger. It has been a summer of discontent at
  Wednesday, although the problems began years ago, and the only thing for
  supporters to cling to is that it may end Dejphon Chansiri’s reign. Those at
  the King Power Stadium are due to show their disdain for the ownership by
  leaving their seats empty for the first five minutes and covering the area
  with a large anti-Chansiri banner. A plane is scheduled to fly overhead with a
  further message aimed at the owner. “The attitude among the fans at the minute
  is despair,” says Ian Bennett, the chair of the supporters’ trust. “In the
  short term, surviving is the biggest thing and I think it’s going to be a
  problem. We’re not going to be competitive at all. I think it’s just going to
  be an absolute nightmare and we’re very concerned about the future of the
  club.” It is not the first protest against Chansiri and the reasons for
  complaints are so plentiful it would take a book to explain. To concentrate on
  some of the most recent elements, employees did not receive their full wages
  in June and July, leading Josh Windass and Michael Smith to hand in their
  notice and depart for nothing; the prized asset Djeidi Gassama was sold to
  Rangers for £2.2m – far below his market value – to belatedly fund June’s
  salary shortfall; there are 16 first-team players on the books, including a
  solitary goalkeeper; the club are under a transfer embargo until 2027, which
  stipulates they cannot pay fees; and Danny Röhl, the highly rated head coach,
  has departed. Players took a stand by backing out of a friendly against
  Burnley and released a statement demanding a resolution. A strike has been
  mooted but the focus is to prepare as best they can for competitive fixtures
  for the sake of supporters under a head coach, Henrik Pedersen, who is aiming
  to bring tranquility amid the chaos. He took time to watch a staff member play
  padel this week. Even Pedersen, however, was uncertain on Thursday whether the
  captain, Barry Bannan, could be registered to feature on Sunday after signing
  a new contract. Money received this week via Premier League solidarity
  payments allowed wages to be paid on Friday, lifting certain embargo
  restrictions and enabling the club to sign players on free transfers and
  register Bannan, but the long-term picture is beyond precarious. Players have
  been on trial, experienced unattached players such as Ben Mee and Liam Cooper
  have been offered to the Owls, and the club are scouring the loan market to
  strengthen depth. One player who has trained and was wanted by Pedersen did
  not meet work permit requirements. The supporters’ trust created a fund for
  club employees to access if facing financial struggles. In a further sign of
  Wednesday’s problems the North Stand, which is emblazoned with Chansiri’s name
  and holds 9,000 supporters, many of whom are season-ticket holders, has been
  closed by the council. Work needs to be carried out on the roof to make it
  safe and the club say they “remain hopeful” of having it open for Stoke’s
  visit next Saturday in the first home match. Chansiri says he is willing to
  sell, but has dismissed at least two bids because he is seeking £100m,
  regarded by many interested parties as far too much. Given the circumstances,
  optimism – or possibly desperation – abounds that the tuna magnate will lower
  his demands. “There’s a massive opportunity for somebody to take this club by
  the scruff of the neck and make a lot of money,” says Bennett. One potential
  bidder is John Textor but his recent off-field record at Lyon, including
  substantial debts and a Uefa fine for a breach of financial sustainability
  requirements, makes many supporters uneasy. The American has been open about
  his desire to buy an English club and is keeping an eye on Wednesday after
  selling his shares in Crystal Palace. It is likely the fans’ pressure on
  Chansiri will be ramped up at the first home game. More protests will take
  place as supporters aim to get the widest audience to highlight their plight.
  Chansiri will not be present, wisely keeping his distance. “The fans are
  determined to keep following the club and the motto is: ‘Support the team, not
  the regime,’” says Bennett. The EFL eventually found reason to disqualify Dai
  Yongge from owning Reading, forcing him to sell. There are no such
  circumstances or wrongdoing in relation to Chansiri, so supporters are reliant
  on his leaving willingly. There is fear among fans that 158 years of history
  could be about to go up in smoke and the message from Bennett to Chansiri is
  clear: “Please – with some dignity – leave and don’t be forced out, and just
  give the supporters a chance to support a competitive football club. You say
  you are all about family. We are a big family, show us some respect for that.”
