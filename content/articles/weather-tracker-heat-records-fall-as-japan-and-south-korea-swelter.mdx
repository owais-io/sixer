  The heat continues in Japan and South Korea, after both countries experienced
  their warmest Junes on record and hit the same benchmark for July. In Japan,
  the national temperature record fell on Wednesday, as the city of Tamba in
  western Honshu reached 41.2C, breaking the previous record from 2020 by 0.1C.
  On the same day, local temperature records were broken in 39 locations –
  including in Kyoto, which reached 40C for the first time – with almost a third
  of the Japan Meteorological Agency’s weather stations reporting highs above
  35C. This is the third year in a row that the July average temperature record
  has been broken, with July 2025 closing out at 2.89C above the 1991-2020
  average. In a similarly sweltering South Korea, Seoul had a record-breaking 22
  consecutive “tropical nights”, a term used by the Korea Meteorological
  Administration when overnight temperatures fail to fall below 25C. On
  Thursday, the minimum overnight temperature in the capital was 29.3C. With
  August typically the hottest month of the year for both countries, fears are
  now growing for what may lie ahead. There is some respite on the horizon.
  Temperatures are expected to fall back to climate average by the weekend.
  However, long-term forecast models suggest that temperatures will trend above
  average throughout the latter part of August and into September. The summers
  of 2023 and 2024 were jointly the warmest recorded in Japan, while 2024 was
  one of South Korea’s warmest years overall – records that could fall by the
  end of 2025. Meanwhile, the start of August was unusually wet and chilly for
  parts of eastern Australia. Complex low pressure systems to the east of the
  continent brought frequent rain to New South Wales, with large swathes of the
  eastern coast recording 100-200mm since the start of the month – around double
  the August average. This moist air flowing in from the Tasman Sea collided
  with colder air already sitting over eastern Australia. The fallout was a rare
  significant snowfall event over higher ground in northern New South Wales and
  southern Queensland, where as much as 40cm fell in places – the heaviest for
  at least 20 years. While there was significant disruption, with more than
  27,000 homes losing power and about 200 vehicles becoming stranded, the
  snowfall was a positive experience for many. “Snow tourists” flocked to
  affected areas from further afield to enjoy the rare winter wonderland, some
  of whom came to see snow for the first time in their lives.
