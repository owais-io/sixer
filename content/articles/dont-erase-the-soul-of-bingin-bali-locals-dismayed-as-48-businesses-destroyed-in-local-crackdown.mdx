  “I can’t believe this is happening,” said Komang Agus, looking on in despair
  at his workplace of 16 years in the Bali tourist hotspot of Bingin, lying in
  fresh ruins. “I have a wife, three sons, my father is sick and in the
  hospital, how am I going to support them?” the manager of Morabito Art Cliff
  Villa said, his voice cracking and tears welling in his eyes. “We understand
  the laws and the need for regulation, but why only here?” Agus spoke to the
  Guardian shortly after the government embarked on a sweeping crackdown on
  alleged illegal coastal developments on Indonesia’s most popular tourist
  island. The demolition of 48 cliffside establishments at Bingin beach –
  ranging from warungs (small eateries) and homestays to boutique villas and
  restaurants overlooking one of the world’s most revered waves – marks a
  flashpoint in Bali’s struggle with mass tourism, overdevelopment and the
  desire to retain the cultural and surfing heritage that put the island on the
  global tourist map in the first place. Bingin is being cleared as part of a
  campaign led by the re-elected governor, Wayan Koster, to enforce zoning
  regulations and eliminate unregulated structures on protected government-owned
  land. “The Bali provincial government is preparing a team to conduct an
  investigative audit of tourism business permits throughout Bali,” said Koster,
  hammer in hand at the start of the Bingin demolition in July. “We cannot allow
  it. If we let these methods continue throughout Bali, Bali will be ruined.”
  More than 20 other businesses have also been targeted as allegedly illegal by
  local authorities at nearby Balangan beach, and others across the Bukit
  peninsula and beyond may soon face similar action. But for many locals, the
  loss of Bingin represents a further gutting of a historic and cherished part
  of the island’s surf culture that in many places has been overtaken by mega
  resorts, shopping strips and beach clubs. Surfers, many of them Australian,
  began arriving at Bingin in the 1970s and 1980s, attracted by its perfect
  mechanical left-hand barrel waves. Local families built small warungs on the
  cliffs to serve them. Among them was Kelly’s Warung, established by the family
  of local professional surfer Mega Semadhi. “This place feels like home, away
  from the noise and chaos above – a beautiful beach, beautiful wave and
  people,” Samadhi told the Guardian. “There are not many places like this
  left.” Over time, the area grew and commercialised, with some rooms now
  renting for over A$200 a night and small family-run businesses morphing into
  multi-level luxury suites like the towering Morabito Art Cliff boutique hotel,
  with multiple swimming pools – and one even in its master suite. “The
  developments got out of control and people got greedy,” said Semadhi, who
  lives and works in the village nearby with his wife and two young children.
  “We tried to stop it, but the government didn’t listen to us [at the time].
  And now it’s too late.” Semadhi called for the community to be involved in the
  future of the area. “If they are going to redo it, we want to do it properly.
  To return the soul of how it started. If we lose this place, all of Bingin
  will suffer.” Tourists have also expressed dismay; many gathered on the beach
  throughout the week after the demolition began, completely unaware of the
  plans. Several Australian expats said they had been advised against speaking
  out publicly, with concerns they could be deported. An Australian surfer and
  local business owner, who first visited Bingin over 30 years ago, described it
  as a “very special place”. “The first time I came down here, we could only eat
  food and sleep on people’s decks. There was something magical about it,” he
  said. “Australians were among the first surfers to come here and form a
  special relationship with the Balinese. There aren’t many places like this
  left.” Business owners – many foreigners, including Australians – say many of
  the structures existed before zoning rules were formalised and the land became
  deemed a protected area, and efforts were made to ensure operations were
  compliant. Alex Barung, a lawyer representing some owners attempting to halt
  the demolitions, said the community had tried multiple times to resolve the
  issue and work with the government. “In 1985, the community realised the
  tourism potential and built supporting facilities. They lacked capital and so
  partnered with foreigners – but the businesses came first, before the
  regulations.” Owners argue that they were operating under customary law, with
  informal permission from the village to operate. Critics of the demolition –
  which officials expect to take a month – warn that erasing Bingin risks
  destroying a unique cultural and social ecosystem. “This is part of Bali’s
  surfing heritage,” said Piter Panjaitan, a local surfer and environmentalist.
  “It became a hotspot, a golden egg of the Bukit peninsula. Now, 1,000 people
  are losing their jobs overnight. People are crying.” He questioned the
  transparency and consistency of the government’s approach. “We understand the
  need to clean up, but why here, and why like this? We want to make Bali
  better, but we also want social justice.” The demolition highlights challenges
  in Bali’s growth. The island’s population has doubled since the 1960s to more
  than 4 million, and tourist arrivals are projected to hit 6.5 million this
  year. The government has floated – and abandoned – a moratorium on tourism
  development, opting instead for tighter controls. Local environmental group
  Walhi Bali said it supported reining in unregulated growth but criticised
  “selective enforcement”. “From our research, there are many other developments
  across Bali lacking permits and environmental assessments,” said Walhi Bali’s
  Ida Bagus Arya Yoga Bharata. “The inconsistency highlights the slow and weak
  governance in Bali’s development planning.” The head of Bali’s Public Order
  Agency, I Dewa Nyoman Rai Darmadi, denied claims the demolitions were clearing
  space for luxury developments. “That’s a hoax,” he told the Guardian. He said
  it was about safety, with many businesses packed into the steep cliff zone and
  that public land was “not for business like currently”. “This is protected
  land. There’s no indication of it being taken over by an investor.” Still,
  uncertainty looms, even from officials. “Once it’s renovated, it will become
  an attraction – whether for surfers or something else,” said Governor Koster.
  “At the very least, tourists will want to come, and it will contribute to the
  wellbeing of the local community.” And without a clear plan, locals worry the
  area could be redeveloped without them. But despite the sadness, Semadhi said
  he was optimistic about the future. “If they are going to do it, then maybe we
  can do it properly this time, a new beginning. But let us be part of it. Don’t
  erase the soul of Bingin.”
