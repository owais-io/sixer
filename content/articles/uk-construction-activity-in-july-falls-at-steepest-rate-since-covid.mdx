  Activity in the UK construction sector fell last month at the sharpest rate
  since the height of the Covid pandemic amid a collapse in housebuilding,
  underscoring the challenge facing the government to meet its 1.5m new homes
  target. The figures from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence showed activity
  fell in July at the steepest pace since May 2020, during the first UK
  coronavirus lockdown. The data provider said a sharp drop in residential
  building pulled down its monthly purchasing managers index (PMI) for the UK
  construction sector as a whole, alongside a plunge in civil engineering and a
  softer downturn in commercial property. Compiled from a survey of about 150
  construction companies, the survey is closely monitored by the Treasury and
  the Bank of England for early warning signs from the economy. Threadneedle
  Street is widely expected to cut borrowing costs on Thursday, with financial
  markets putting the odds of a quarter-point reduction at 95%, amid growing
  economic concerns. Unemployment is rising, inflation is sticky, output shrank
  in April and May, and global trade is reeling from Donald Trump’s latest round
  of punitive country-specific tariffs, which are due to come into force on
  Thursday. Figures published on Tuesday showed that last month the UK services
  sector recorded its biggest drop in new orders in almost three years. Joe
  Hayes, a principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said:
  “Forward-looking indicators from the survey imply that UK constructors are
  preparing for challenging times ahead. “Anecdotally, companies reported a lack
  of tender opportunities and a hesitancy from customers to commit to projects.
  Broader themes of uncertainty, both domestically but also internationally,
  will do little to reignite investment appetites.” The headline UK construction
  PMI fell from 48.8 in June to 44.3 in July, on a scale where a reading of 50.0
  separates growth from contraction. The housing activity index, a subcomponent
  of the overall score, fell from 50.7 in June to 45.3 in July. The figures will
  raise fresh questions about Labour’s target of building 1.5m new homes by the
  end of the parliament. Housing experts have said the goal is unlikely to be
  met, while industry bosses have suggested that the government significantly
  overestimated how many new homes could be built. The government is pushing to
  drive up housebuilding through changes to planning rules, proposals for a new
  generation of new towns, and £39bn of additional funding for social housing.
  However, analysts warn that the building trade is struggling with crippling
  labour shortages and other mounting economic headwinds that could stifle
  investment in housebuilding, including stubborn inflationary pressures and tax
  rises such as April’s jump in employers’ national insurance contributions
  (NICs). Matt Swannell, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said:
  “Businesses will continue to face a difficult operating environment as labour
  costs remain high due to ongoing labour shortages, as well as higher NICs and
  national living wage. “The outlook for housebuilding in particular is mixed as
  the effects of planning reforms are counter-balanced by elevated construction
  costs and labour market shortages.” There is mounting speculation about tax
  rises in Rachel Reeves’ autumn budget, despite business groups warning that
  further increases could hit the chancellor’s ambition to drive up economic
  growth. On Wednesday the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
  said the chancellor could be facing a shortfall in the public finances worth
  up to £50bn at the autumn budget. However, ministers are hopeful that
  Britain’s economy could turn a corner, with support from further Bank of
  England rate cuts easing some of the financial pressure on households and
  businesses. Financial markets anticipate at least two further reductions in
  borrowing costs by December 2026, taking the base rate to 3.5%. Elliott
  Jordan-Doak, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics,
  said: “We still think the fundamentals point to sentiment in the construction
  sector gradually improving in the coming months. “The Bank of England will
  likely cut interest rates in August, reducing borrowing costs for businesses,
  and the shock from tariff uncertainty will continue to fade. Moreover, the
  government’s focus on investment spending and planning reforms should also
  provide support to the construction industry. The PMI should recover over the
  coming months.”
