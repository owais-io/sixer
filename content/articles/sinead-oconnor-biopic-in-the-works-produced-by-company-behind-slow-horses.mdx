  A biopic of Sinéad O’Connor is in the works, with its backers including the
  company involved in Nothing Compares, the acclaimed 2022 documentary about the
  singer. According to Variety, the film will be directed by Josephine Decker,
  who made a much-liked biopic of horror writer Shirley Jackson, starring
  Elisabeth Moss, in 2020. The script will be by Stacey Gregg, who has credits
  on TV series Mary and George, Little Birds and The Letter for the King.
  Production companies behind the project include See-Saw Films, whose past
  output includes The King’s Speech, Shame, The Power of the Dog and Slow
  Horses, alongside Nine Daughters (God’s Creatures, Lady Macbeth) and
  ie:entertainment, which acted as executive producer on Nothing Compares.
  O’Connor died in 2023, aged 56, after a string of hit records including the
  huge-selling Nothing Compares 2 U in 1990, and a tumultuous life marked with
  outspoken protest and controversy. In 1992 she ripped up a picture of the pope
  on US TV; in 1999 she was ordained as a priest by an independent Catholic
  group, and in 2018 she converted to Islam. According to Variety, the film will
  follow O’Connor’s early years in the music industry, “tell[ing] the story of
  how one young woman from Dublin took on the world, examining how her global
  fame may have been built on her talent, but her name became synonymous with
  her efforts to draw attention to the crimes committed by the Catholic church
  and the Irish state”.
