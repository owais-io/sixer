  If you had asked me as a teenager whether I saw my future in Morecambe, I’d
  have laughed you out of our faded seaside town. I’d been plotting my escape
  since I was 14. The sea was grey, the sand was treacherous and the wind was
  always messing up my hair. I was totally unmoved by the view across the bay of
  the Lake District fells. It felt like half of the world was cut off. You could
  go left or right on the prom but never straight ahead, unless you wanted to
  end up stuck in mud waving frantically for the coastguard. A whole compass
  point was out of reach. This summer, 25 years after I left for good, I
  returned to talk to the young people living there now as part of the
  Guardian’s Against the tide project, examining gen Z lives by the sea in
  England. All the research shows that life chances are drastically reduced if
  you grow up on the coast, which rather contradicts Morecambe’s motto: “Beauty
  surrounds and health abounds.” The truth is that bad health abounds. One in
  four people have a limiting, long-term illness or disability. People smoke and
  drink too much, and they are 20% more likely to be depressed than the national
  average. In Morecambe town centre, men have a healthy life expectancy of only
  56 years and can expect to live to just 72. Deprivation is at the heart of it
  all. My mother was a psychiatrist in Morecambe and often lamented that
  whatever she prescribed, she could not make poor people rich. Life can be
  tough for many of Morecambe’s young people, too. Take Eleanor Adamson, a
  bright and funny 22-year-old carer who spent some of her teenage years living
  in the Forum, a homeless hostel on the promenade – a completely unsuitable
  place for a child trying to get to sixth form each morning. Eleanor thinks
  Morecambe is beautiful, particularly the Lakeland views that left me so cold
  as a teenager. Yet her eyes widen when I tell her what has disappeared in
  Morecambe since I was her age: a wild west-themed amusement park called
  Frontierland, an indoor-outdoor pool with slides called Bubbles, and a music
  venue on the prom called the Superdome. My first proper gig was there, at what
  became renamed the Dome, to see Blur in the mid-90s. She can hardly believe
  it: “No way. They came to Morecambe? Wow, imagine that. “I would love for
  there to be a music venue,” she says. “I think it would just get the whole
  community buzzing. Things to look forward to are so important.” Now, though,
  there is nothing to do for teenagers, she says, except go to the park and “try
  to meet fit lads from the grammar”. I go back to my old school, a
  comprehensive one block from the prom now called Morecambe Bay Academy. When I
  was there, I was largely oblivious to the challenges of many of my classmates,
  even though I knew some lived in caravans or B&amp;Bs. Now, the sixth formers
  I spoke to are more aware of how many of their classmates struggle. These
  days, almost 40% of all pupils at Morecambe Bay Academy are eligible for free
  school meals and a third have special educational needs – far higher than the
  average across England. And although results are improving, only 46% of
  children got the equivalent of a C or above in GCSE English and maths last
  year, far lower than the national average of 65.1%. “There’s a lot of
  poverty-stricken families and food banks and food clubs,” says Imogen, who
  moved to Morecambe a few years ago from Nottingham. The school recently
  started a “preloved uniform” sale, offering trousers and coats for £3. The
  17-year-olds I interviewed were also clear-eyed about the decline the town is
  experiencing. “I’ve lived here all my life and a lot has changed in Morecambe.
  And the change really is that things have disappeared rather than appeared,”
  says Eve. When I ask them what they do for fun now, one of the replies was
  “walk up and down the prom and maybe pop into Aldi”. Florence thinks Morecambe
  does not get its fair share of government funding. “We don’t have anywhere to
  go because no one funds it,” she says. Sitting across from her, Lucas thinks
  that young people are neglected by those in charge, with politicians putting
  too much focus on trying to lure tourists back. “They need to think about the
  locals, because there’s actual people living here. It’s not just a
  destination,” he says. The teenagers are all aware of what many in Morecambe
  are pinning their future hopes on: the Eden Project, a £100m eco-tourist
  attraction earmarked for the seafront, which promises to “reimagine the
  seaside resort for the 21st century”. This will be the salty northern sister
  to the Eden Project in Cornwall, with a shell-shaped biodome surrounded by
  interconnected gardens. Though the Guardian first reported on Eden North in
  2018, shovels are not yet in the ground seven years later. Matthew thinks it
  will be good when it finally arrives. “It would open a lot of jobs for local
  people,” he says, “and it could be a good push for Morecambe to start getting
  more funding to fix some of the problems that are already here.” Eve is more
  sceptical: “It seems that we are disregarded and nobody cares really what’s
  happening around here. If the government really did care about places like
  Morecambe, which are filled with specific types of wildlife that you don’t
  find anywhere else and beautiful beaches and sunsets, why the hell isn’t the
  Eden Project here yet when they’ve been promising it since, what, 2018?” To be
  fair, Rishi Sunak’s government did chip in £50m, and Eden’s management say
  construction will begin later this year, with the doors finally opening in
  autumn 2028. But what, beyond Eden, do local leaders have to offer young
  people in Morecambe? I go to ask Russell Walsh, another former pupil of
  Morecambe Bay Academy, who in May became one of 53 Reform councillors elected
  to Lancashire county council. Reform UK now runs the local authority and is
  therefore in charge of youth services. Walsh accepts the teenagers’ diagnosis
  that Morecambe has become a place where things close, rather than open. But
  when I ask him what Reform have to offer them instead, he seems stumped.
  “That’s a very good question,” he admits. “I mean we’re definitely
  pro-development; we’re in favour of Eden and we’re looking on with interest at
  what’s going to happen to Frontierland. And specifically for young people … do
  you know what, I’m not actually too sure.” I tell him that I have been looking
  at his social media and he seems focused mostly on opposing a local housing
  development and filling in potholes; I could see nothing aimed specifically at
  young people. “You’re right,” he says. “You’ve caught me out.” He says it’s
  “just something else which I need to turn around and put on the list for us
  definitely to attack”. I hope that all the Reform councillors pop in and see
  what is happening at More Music in Morecambe’s West End. When I visit, it is
  youth night, with teenagers creating bands in every corner of the former music
  hall. My favourite is Linus and the Zits – three boys from eastern European
  families, dreaming of becoming international rock stars with their
  Weezer-inspired jams. Leroy Lupton, one of the leaders at More Music, says
  Morecambe can feel disconnected from the rest of the country, and “left
  behind” compared with Liverpool and Manchester, the two nearest big cities. “I
  often think it has echoes of happiness,” he says, “because I think with a few
  of the seaside towns, they used to be holiday destinations, and since people
  started going abroad, they kind of got left in the dirt and forgotten about.”
  That is why places such as More Music are so important, Lupton says. “Maybe
  I’m being a bit romantic about it,” he adds, “but it feels like a beacon, like
  a ray of light.” • The Against the Tide series is a collaboration between the
  Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden
