  As Israel gears up for a new offensive in Gaza, figures from a classified
  database suggest the country’s political and military leadership has for two
  years misled their country and the world about a war that has overwhelmingly
  killed civilians. In May this year, Israel’s military intelligence database of
  Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters had 47,653 names. Of them, 8,900
  were marked as killed, or probably killed, a joint investigation by the
  Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the
  Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found. That is less than one in five of
  the total, and far below figures given publicly by politicians and military
  commanders, who have given tolls more than double that number, varying between
  17,000 and 20,000 for the same period. An intelligence team reviewing militant
  casualties concluded that the database probably undercounted the total “by a
  little” but the significantly higher figures given publicly were “inaccurate”,
  several intelligence sources said. Killing a significant proportion of enemy
  soldiers is not always a military objective in war or a precondition for
  victory. But in the absence of a long-term strategy, Israel’s military chose
  to make the militant toll a metric of their success. Soon after the start of
  the war, Yossi Sariel, then the head of the elite 8200 intelligence unit,
  began sending a daily update on the toll in the form of a data graph, which
  was dubbed the “war dashboard”, several intelligence sources told the
  Guardian. The display was treated like “a football game, officers sitting
  around watching the numbers go up on the dashboard,” one source said. Sariel
  and other senior commanders presented the deaths of Hamas fighters as an
  objective in itself, sources said. There was no discussion of how Gaza would
  be controlled or governed if Hamas collapsed, or what concessions Israel might
  try to force through the mass killing of individual fighters. “We had a
  beautiful, interactive dashboard, but we didn’t understand the goals of the
  war,” one of Sariel’s subordinates said. “It was very frustrating, the
  flattening of things into numbers.” Asked about his focus on the number of
  militant casualties, Sariel declined to comment. Several sources said that
  inflating militant death tolls, figures frequently reported and amplified by
  the Israeli media, was seen by some in the military as a way to restore their
  standing in the eyes of the Israeli public after the failures of 7 October
  2023. But from a strategic perspective that attempt to measure military
  progress through a militant body count, amid an extremely high rate of
  civilian killing, was tactically unsound and self-defeating, a senior western
  military source said. “They are just measuring the wrong statistic. They will
  never be able to kill everybody who is associated with Hamas, so what is the
  definition of victory?” For nearly two years, Benjamin Netanyahu has said
  Israeli forces are in Gaza to “destroy Hamas”, an objective so vague it could
  be pursued almost indefinitely. The military capacities that allowed the group
  to massacre 1,200 people in Israel in 2023 have been destroyed. All bar one of
  the leadership group who planned the 7 October attacks have been killed, as
  have many of their replacements. Israel has reduced much of Gaza to a
  flattened wasteland, killed or injured one in 10 of the prewar population and
  forced the starving survivors into just 20% of Gaza’s area. In that
  apocalyptic landscape, after intensive bombings and ground operations that
  have killed tens of thousands of civilians, most of the people listed in
  Israel’s database as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters are still
  alive. Israel defines and targets as militants many people who do not
  participate in combat, and are protected civilians under international law. A
  specific piece of intelligence is attached to every operative on the list whom
  the army is sure it killed, justifying that designation, intelligence sources
  said. The Guardian, +972 and Local Call obtained figures without names or
  additional reports. “Anybody that we have knowledge of their death, in any way
  whatsoever, will be documented there,” one source said. The document notes the
  confirmed deaths of 7,330 militants and records 1,570 as “probably dead”.
  There were 750 senior Hamas operatives in the database; 300 were labelled as
  certainly or probably killed. Comparing the military database with the
  casualty list compiled by the Gaza health ministry indicates Israel killed
  five civilians for each militant inside Gaza. Mass killing is one factor cited
  by scholars, lawyers and rights groups, who say Israel is committing genocide
  in Gaza. True death toll is higher Both the military database and the health
  ministry casualty list are underestimates. Israel’s military intelligence
  teams are aware they had not identified all militants and do not know of every
  death, sources with knowledge of the database said. But their estimates still
  indicated that “for each militant, four civilians were killed”. The casualty
  list published by the health ministry includes only those whose bodies have
  been recovered, not the thousands buried under the rubble. Peer-reviewed
  international research also indicates a significantly higher toll. Yet
  Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations
  of war crimes, is promising that another ground operation in Gaza City – which
  would inevitably bring further mass killings of Palestinian civilians – will
  allow the military to “seize control of the last terrorist strongholds” and
  defeat Hamas. The western military source said: “What we are seeing now is
  another throw of a losing dice. Because this is not going to work. It’s going
  to be more of the same. “There is no way that any of this is going to lead to
  any situation where you could possibly apply the word victory. It’s gratuitous
  violence for no military point at all.” Hamas now has just a handful of
  rockets that it would struggle to deploy and its fighters would not easily get
  near the border fence, much less through it. It does not pose an existential
  threat to Israel, according to Israeli and Palestinian experts. “They have
  lost the ability to threaten Israel itself for the next one to two decades
  minimum,” said Muhammad Shehada, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign
  Relations. But if fighting continues in Gaza, Hamas could have time and
  manpower on its side. Israel’s military is structured to fight conventional
  armies in short wars, mobilising from reserves. Growing numbers of reservists
  are now refusing to report for duty, and the military is considering an appeal
  to the diaspora. “Hamas can maintain a long-term insurgency in Gaza, because
  it doesn’t take much: all they need is rifles and anti-tank weapons,” Shehada
  said. “If they recycle the Israeli bombs that didn’t explode there is an
  endless supply of explosives, and the genocide provides an infinite recruiting
  pool for new members.” American intelligence estimates suggest Hamas has
  recruited 15,000 operatives during the war, about twice as many as Israel has
  killed. Public claims of a death toll approaching 20,000 have also been
  criticised by rightwing figures inside Israel. The retired general Itzhak
  Brik, a confidant of Netanyahu at the start of the war but now a fierce
  critic, believes even the 8,900 figure is an exaggeration. The focus on the
  death toll offered a dangerous incentive to lie, he said, describing the much
  higher toll as “one of the most serious bluffs” in the country’s history. In
  April 2024, several members of the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense
  committee questioned militant casualty figures presented to them by the army,
  the rightwing daily Israel Hayom reported. After examining the military’s
  data, the committee members found public estimates had inflated the number of
  militant casualties “in order to create a 2:1 ratio” between civilian and
  militant deaths. Their findings echo numbers in the militant database seen by
  the Guardian. The list is based on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad
  documents from before and after 7 October and extensive research. It includes
  thousands of militants the army believes were recruited after the start of the
  war. The Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the database or the
  casualty data when approached for comment by Local Call and +972. When the
  Guardian asked for comment on the same data, a spokesperson said they had
  decided to “rephrase” their response. In a statement to the Guardian the
  military did not directly address questions about the intelligence database.
  It said “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without specifying
  the data it disputed. A spokesperson did not respond when asked why the
  military had given different responses to questions about a single set of
  data.
