  Motoring groups have welcomed government plans to overhaul road safety laws
  that could result in over-70s being banned if they fail eyesight tests but
  have implored ministers to go further with measures they believe could protect
  younger drivers and their passengers. Ministers are considering cutting the
  drink-drive limit in England and Wales and introducing mandatory eye tests for
  older drivers, the Times reported on Monday. The proposals also reportedly
  include tougher penalties for uninsured driving and failing to wear a seatbelt
  – but not measures to stop inexperienced drivers being responsible for the
  safety of groups of their friends. On Great Britain’s roads last year, 1,633
  people were killed and almost 28,000 seriously injured in traffic incidents;
  and numbers have remained relatively constant after a large drop between 2000
  and 2010. “The time has come for a bold and proactive approach to road safety.
  This strategy is much overdue as road deaths have plateaued over the last
  decade,” said the AA’s president, Edmund King. “We believe these new measures
  will not only modernise our approach to saving lives but also provide renewed
  momentum in making our roads safer for everyone.” Vision checks for older
  drivers and targeting drink and drug drivers were “practical steps that can
  make a real difference”, he said. But failing to introduce limits on new
  drivers transporting peer-age passengers for six months was “a major
  oversight”, he added. Nicholas Lyes, the director of policy and standards at
  the road safety charity IAM RoadSmart, said: “Given progress on reducing fatal
  and serious collisions has stalled in recent years, we welcome the UK
  government’s ambition to publish an updated road safety strategy with the
  reported measures being a step in the right direction. “While many drivers
  over the age of 70 are safe and competent, health issues and confidence can
  have an impact on driving abilities, so it is sensible to review whether
  changes need to be made. “We would also support reducing the drink-drive limit
  in England and Wales, alongside measures to target drug-driving. However,
  these would require significantly more backing for roads policing teams to
  effectively enforce new laws.” A Labour source said: “At the end of the last
  Labour government, the number of people killed and seriously injured on our
  roads was at a record low, but numbers have remained stubbornly high under
  successive Conservative governments. “In no other circumstance would we accept
  1,600 people dying, with thousands more seriously injured, costing the NHS
  more than £2bn per year.” Meanwhile, the number of people killed in
  drink-driving incidents has increased over the past decade, reaching a 13-year
  high in 2022 and prompting concern that existing road safety measures are no
  longer working. Under the plans being considered by the transport secretary,
  Heidi Alexander, the drink-drive limit in England and Wales could be brought
  in line with Scotland and the rest of Europe with a cut from 35 micrograms of
  alcohol per 100ml of breath to 22 micrograms. The UK is one of only three
  European countries to rely on self-reporting of eyesight problems that affect
  driving, leading ministers to consider compulsory eye tests every three years
  for drivers aged older than 70, and a driving ban for those who fail. Other
  proposals are reported to include allowing the police to bring prosecutions
  for drug-driving on the basis of roadside saliva tests, rather than blood
  tests, as increasing numbers of drivers are being caught with drugs in their
  system. The Labour source added the government would “deliver the first road
  safety strategy in a decade, imposing tougher penalties on those breaking the
  law, protecting road users and restoring order to our roads”. The strategy is
  due to be published in autumn, and all proposals will be subject to
  consultation.
