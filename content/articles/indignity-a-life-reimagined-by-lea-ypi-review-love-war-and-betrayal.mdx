  It starts with a photo. A black-and-white image of a couple relaxing on a pair
  of sun loungers in front of a luxury ski hotel: him, squinting against the
  sun; her, smiling at the camera, wrapped in a white fur coat. It is their
  honeymoon in Cortina, up in the Italian Alps. The year is 1941, and the woman
  is Lea Ypi’s grandmother. Ypi saw the picture after it had been posted online
  by a stranger, gone viral across Albania, and attracted a stream of abuse.
  “Morally degenerate” was one comment. “Fascist collaborator” another. And so,
  in Indignity, Ypi sets off to find out exactly who her grandmother was. It is,
  she writes, partly out of a sense of duty, to defend her family member from
  the trolls – a kind of 21st-century version of EP Thompson’s famous call for
  history to rescue the dead from “the enormous condescension of posterity”. But
  partly, Ypi admits, it is because she finds the photo unsettling. How to
  reconcile her beloved, compassionate grandmother with this glamorous young
  woman living it up in Mussolini’s Italy? From here, two parallel stories
  unfold. The core of Indignity is a richly reimagined retelling of Ypi’s
  grandmother’s life. Born in Salonica (now Thessaloniki) in 1918, Leman
  Leskoviku came into a world that was already falling apart. Cosmopolitan
  empires were collapsing into nation states, unsure how to treat families like
  hers: Albanian-speaking, living in Greece, with a proud record of service to
  the Ottoman state.Leman’s childhood is shaped by the uncertainty of those
  years: the trauma of wars just ended, economic decline, and blunt, brutal
  social engineering. As Ypi describes, millions were forcibly moved across
  newly drawn borders. Leman’s nanny, one of Salonica’s many Muslim Turks, is
  barely able to hold back tears as she is packed off to central Anatolia. Amid
  the ambiguity, and to escape an unwanted suitor, Leman sets her own life on a
  different path. At just 18, she decides to move to Albania alone. Ypi’s
  Ondaatje prize-winning memoir, Free, was haunted by stories of Albanians
  fleeing to neighbouring countries to escape the violence of the 1990s. This
  story hinges on a young woman’s extraordinary choice to move the other way. In
  1936 Leman finds herself in Tirana for the first time, a city of contrasts, of
  “Chanel perfume and sheep manure”. She lands not only her own job as a civil
  servant, but a husband of her own choosing, too. He is the son of an Albanian
  statesman, at a time when all of politics is in flux. And so the book moves
  through the next two decades, formative years both for Leman and for the young
  country she now calls home. It is led in turn by a self-crowned
  politician-king, then by a civilian government – guided partly by Leman’s
  father-in-law, and drawn into the orbit of Mussolini’s Italy. Finally, as
  Europe descends into war again, it is overrun by fascist, Nazi and communist
  troops. It is a history brought to life through Ypi’s novelistic style. Deaths
  in the family – whether on a tragic wedding day or out on the front line – are
  more poignant seen through Leman’s eyes. The narrative is suspenseful, not
  least because Leman’s adopted family is so close to power – close enough, for
  example, that she can smell “lavender and onions” on the breath of a young
  Enver Hoxha, the Stalinist who would go on to rule Albania for 40 years.
  Eventually Leman’s husband – Ypi’s grandfather – is accused, in Hoxha’s new
  Albania, of being an enemy of the state, with devastating consequences for her
  and her young son. Alongside that story, the book also traces Ypi’s own search
  among the archives to see what she can find out about Leman. Sometimes, the
  documents she uncovers – informants’ reports, prison confessions, transcripts
  from the Albanian constituent assembly – are used to brilliant effect,
  complementing the broader historical story. But it is much less clear whether
  this quest lives up to the initial sense of intrigue – the hints of spying,
  fascist collaboration, and the photo of a young couple enjoying their
  honeymoon in the Alps. Her conclusion – about the limited nature of the
  historical record itself – is thought-provoking. But it is narratively
  unsatisfying, too. Ypi may have known all along that some secrets are for
  history to keep. “Women and archives,” one student tells her, reflecting on
  how little has been preserved about so many, “you’re better off writing a
  novel!” But if the paper trail peters out, a different goal may still have
  been met. When Ypi’s grandmother died in 2006, she explains, she spoke at her
  funeral, but couldn’t find the words to do justice to the woman Leman had
  been. With Indignity, she may have done so at last. • Indignity by Lea Ypi is
