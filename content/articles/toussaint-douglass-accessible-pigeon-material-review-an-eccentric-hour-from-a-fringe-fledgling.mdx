  Toussaint Douglass: Accessible Pigeon Material review – an eccentric hour from
  a fringe fledgling
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-08T04:00:04Z'
bodyText: >-
  Twenty years ago, Original Pirate Material emerged from Brixton and made a
  star of Mike Skinner AKA the Streets. Now from another corner of south London
  comes its near-namesake Accessible Pigeon Material, by Lewisham export
  Toussaint Douglass. Dry your eyes, mate? OK, Douglass’s compendium of
  autobiography and bird gags may not reduce you to tears. But it’s an
  eye-catching hour from an act with a distinctive line in do-things-his-own-way
  comedy. Eccentricity is relative, of course. Douglass promises (or should that
  be threatens?) that pigeons, pigeons and more pigeons will be all we’re
  getting, and, to stress the point, there’s one circulating the stage strapped
  to a remote-controlled car. Pigeon facts are then scattered like seed by a man
  with an outsized zeal for our feathered not-always-friends. But the show soon
  deviates from the avian theme, towards something more conventional for a
  standup debut: a “this is me” account of where Douglass comes from and what
  his life looks like. Dressed “like a croupier” at primary school and reared by
  his beloved gran, AKA “87-year-old flatmate”, he’s now starting a family with
  his partner (cue a fine gag about why he can’t use the word “girlfriend”), and
  still untangling his relationship with his emotionally absent dad. The latter
  is embodied by a glove puppet of a boxer, deployed in a comically awkward
  father-son role play with a member of the audience. The disconnect between
  macho parent and misfit kid is the scab Douglass keeps picking at in a set
  that makes peace, finally, with his neurodivergence. Again, the show leans on
  one or two familiar structural props to make that point. And not all of its
  jokes land. But many do (one about easy peelers; another about wanting to die
  alone), occasionally because dismayed Douglass bellows the punchlines at us
  over and again until we acquiesce. That’s just what he has to do to get us
  normies to connect with his dotty way of seeing. It works: after a lifetime of
  ill-fitting introversion, Douglass has cracked how to make the inside of his
  mind seem not just accessible, but a very fun place to spend time. • At
  Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival
