  Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has ordered the commerce department
  to conduct a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the
  official count. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the census would be
  “based on modern day facts and figures” and use “results and information
  gained from the Presidential Election of 2024”. He added that “people who are
  in our country illegally will not be counted”. The US census has historically
  counted all residents regardless of citizenship or immigration status, as
  required by the 14th amendment’s “whole number of persons” provision. Trump’s
  directive contradicts this constitutional requirement despite there being no
  evidence of problems with the 2020 census. The move would fulfil a
  longstanding rightwing talking point that undocumented immigrants should not
  influence congressional representation or electoral votes. Far-right figures
  have long claimed that states like California gain unfair political advantage
  by counting non-citizens. The political activist Charlie Kirk, for example,
  argued in 2020 that “California gets an extra 9 electoral votes because of
  counting illegals.” Census data determines congressional representation,
  electoral college apportionment and the distribution of federal funding for
  schools, hospitals and other essential services. States with large non-citizen
  populations – particularly California, Texas, Florida and New York – could see
  their political influence and federal resources sharply reduced under Trump’s
  proposed changes. Legal and immigration advocates have also long stressed that
  restricting the census to citizens could depress participation among legal
  immigrants, who are alreadyundercounted because they may be more reluctant to
  engage with government authorities. The US Census Bureau’s own reviews found
  the 2020 count was accurate, with a net error rate of just -0.24%, which they
  say is statistically indistinguishable from zero. The Government
  Accountability Office noted in a 2024 report that the 2020 census produced a
  statistically accurate count of the US population at the national level, with
  no significant net coverage error. Republican lawmakers in both the House and
  Senate have pushed for citizenship-only counts on the census, with the most
  recent effort coming from Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee reintroducing
  legislation in late June, co-sponsored by 18 Senate Republicans. Named the
  Equal Representation Act, it would require only citizens to be counted for
  congressional and electoral purposes, while mandating citizenship questions on
  future censuses. “It is unconscionable that illegal immigrants and
  non-citizens are counted toward congressional district apportionment and our
  electoral map for the presidency,” Hagerty said at the time. Similar efforts
  in 2019 during Trump’s first presidency were blocked by courts and later
  reversed by Biden in 2021. The supreme court ruled such attempts premature and
  legally uncertain. Ironically, the census is actually set to widen in 2030
  after the Biden administration approved adding “Middle Eastern or North
  African” as a new racial category – the first major change since 1977. The
  census directive is part of broader efforts targeting undocumented immigrants
  since Trump took office. The administration has set a goal of deporting 1
  million immigrants annually and reportedly established daily arrest quotas of
  1,200 to 1,500 individuals. According to 2024 Department of Homeland Security
  estimates, approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the
  US as of 2022.
