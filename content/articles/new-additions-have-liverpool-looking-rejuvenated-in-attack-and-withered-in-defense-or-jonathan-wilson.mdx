  It was the Community Shield, and that should not be forgotten. There isn’t
  anybody who has been watching English football for any period of time who
  hasn’t made the mistake of taking too seriously a conclusion drawn in the
  midst of the traditional curtain-raiser, giddy on the sight of Wembley in its
  pomp and the return of competitive club football from the summer wilderness.
  Any analysis has to be tempered. Teams are always works in progress, evolving
  and developing, but that is never truer than in early August with new signings
  adapting to their teammates and surroundings, and others shaking the summer
  from their legs. Things will change. But after Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with
  Crystal Palace and subsequent defeat on penalties in the Community Shield, it
  can be said with a degree of certainty that their new signings have gelled
  better at the front of the pitch than the back. Hugo Ekitiké, signed from
  Eintracht Frankfurt, and Florian Wirtz, signed from Bayer Leverkusen, had
  hugely encouraging debuts. Ekitiké and the attacking right-back Jeremie
  Frimpong, another from Leverkusen, both scored. But Liverpool were shockingly,
  startlingly open at times, as they have been throughout pre-season – and it
  cost them the game. They are learning a new system, the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid
  of last season yielding to a 4-2-3-1. It’s not a huge shift but Wirtz, as the
  most advanced of the triangle of central players between the centre-backs and
  the centre-forward, is very much a forward, whereas Dominik Szoboszlai, who
  tended to be the most advanced of the central midfield triangle last season,
  is an attacking midfielder. It’s not that Wirtz does not perform his defensive
  duties – he does, and is notably assiduous in doing so, a highly effective
  presser of the ball – it’s that he does so in slightly different positions.
  The expectation is that the midfield two in most games going forward, at least
  when Liverpool are not going to monopolise possession, will be Ryan
  Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Gravenberch was unavailable for the
  Community Shield after becoming a father on Saturday night, while Mac Allister
  is still regaining fitness and was restricted to the final 20 minutes. That
  led to Szoboszlai occupying a deeper role than usual alongside Curtis Jones,
  who made a convincing case for occupying the role more frequently with a
  controlled performance in which he completed all 53 of the passes he
  attempted. It was after he and Ekitiké were withdrawn that Palace began to
  mount concerted pressure. Coming to terms with an unfamiliar system without
  the two key cogs at the back of midfield, the area that was always likely to
  come under pressure with the change of formation, was far from ideal for
  Liverpool. They had looked entirely comfortable for the first 15 minutes but
  then a simple straight through-ball opened them up, Jean-Philippe Mateta
  played onside by at least one and possibly both full-backs as Virgil Van Dijk
  and Ibrahima Konaté stepped up in the centre. Although Alisson made the
  initial save, Liverpool were still resetting as the ball was returned to the
  middle, leading to Van Dijk’s clumsy lunge on Mateta and the penalty that
  brought the first equaliser. Van Dijk looked unsettled by what was happening
  immediately in front of him all afternoon, often stepping into the space
  Gravenberch might usually have been expected to be occupying, which in turn
  disrupted the back four. That was what led to the second equaliser: Van Dijk
  being drawn forward, leaving the gap into which Ismaïla Sarr burst to score.
  Clearly Gravenberch’s absence made a difference but nobody should think that
  his return will immediately solve the problems. The new shape means a
  different approach, with Liverpool adopting an aggressive man-to-man press
  that left space behind the defensive line. Sarr caused problems all game,
  repeatedly dragging Milos Kerkez, the fourth of the new signings in the
  starting lineup, infield, which meant Cody Gakpo had to do a lot of work
  tracking Palace’s right wing-back, Daniel Muñoz. None of this is unsolvable,
  but it does mean that Liverpool may be more defensively vulnerable, at least
  in the early part of the campaign, than they were in winning the league last
  season. Ekitiké had an excellent game, his movement and his touch, his
  awareness, all excellent. Wirtz impressed as well with his energy and
  invention; the penultimate pass he played in the buildup to the first goal
  demonstrating his capacity to see opportunities others would not, crafting a
  service to Ekitiké that took three Palace players out of the game. But for any
  side making as many changes as Liverpool have this summer, with four big new
  signings and a fifth perhaps to arrive in Alexander Isak, there will be a
  degree of uncertainty, a period of bedding in. The possibilities are exciting
  but, as Slot reshapes the squad to his own specifications, some teething
  troubles are only to be expected. On this day… Paris Saint-Germain are by some
  margin the youngest of Europe’s giants, having come into being on 11 August
  1970, a day after the birth of the former Manchester United and Ireland
  midfielder Roy Keane. The French capital had no major club which, as European
  competition became established through the 1960s, came to seem increasingly
  bizarre. So, in 1969, the French Football Federation, the mayor of Paris, the
  editor of French sports newspaper l’Équipe and Guy Crescent, who ran the
  Calberson truck company and was prepared to provide financing, got together to
  decide the best way of setting up a team for Paris. A referendum confirmed the
  scheme had overwhelming popularity, voting for the name Paris FC, and, in
  February 1970, a telethon attracted 10,000 people to sign up as members, each
  paying 20 francs. But Paris FC had no stadium, players, coach or licence, so a
  merger was arranged with the second-flight side Stade Saint-Germain, creating
  Paris Saint-Germain (Paris FC broke away in 1972 and, after promotion this
  past May, will compete again in the French top flight this season). After the
  fashion designer Daniel Hechter took over in 1973, redesigning the kit and
  providing investment, the club gained promotion to the top-flight, moving in
  to the Parc des Princes in 1974 as Paris FC were relegated. This is an extract
