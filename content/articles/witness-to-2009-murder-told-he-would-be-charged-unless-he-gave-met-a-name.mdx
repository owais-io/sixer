  Fresh doubts have been cast over a 2009 gang murder conviction after the
  mother of the prosecution’s star witness said he was threatened with being
  charged with the crime himself if he did not give police a name. Kai Shannon,
  33, is 13 years into a life prison sentence for the fatal stabbing of
  18-year-old Wahab Zaaki on the Attlee Terrace estate in Walthamstow, east
  London, on 13 March 2009. He has always insisted he is innocent. Shannon was
  17 at the time and he and Zaaki were junior members of a local gang known as
  the DM crew. No DNA linked Shannon to the crime, no motive was ever
  established and the clothes he was wearing that night had no blood or other
  forensic evidence found on them. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC)
  launched a review of the case in January. The decision came after the Guardian
  revealed analysis of a call between Shannon and another gang member, Rhys
  Williams. In the recording of the call, made from prison, Williams can be
  heard telling Shannon he was “the sacrifice” and agreeing that he knew he did
  not kill Zaaki. Williams was key to securing Shannon’s conviction and he was
  the only witness who told the court he saw Shannon stab Zaaki. In a new
  development, Williams’ mother, Petra Williams, told the Guardian that the
  police put pressure on her son. “They were going to charge him for murder if
  he didn’t tell them who it was,” she said. In the aftermath of the attack,
  Williams was the prime suspect. His hand and wrist were injured that night but
  he left the scene before an ambulance arrived. He was arrested the next day
  and taken by police to hospital where he claimed he had been injured in a
  fight outside a club. Williams would not give an account of the night to
  police but clothes stained with his blood were found in his flat when it was
  searched. Poor-quality finger marks and DNA were recovered from the handle of
  a knife with Zaaki’s blood on it found at the scene. While the evidence were
  too low quality to establish a positive identity, there was sufficient detail
  to exclude Williams. After two years of concerted pressure from the police to
  speak to them – and being assured that they would help him find housing if he
  became a witness – Williams decided to give a statement. He claimed he and
  Zaaki had been smoking marijuana in a stairwell when Shannon and another man,
  Abubakar Alawi, who was later convicted of manslaughter, rushed up to Zaaki
  and started to attack him. Williams said it was Shannon who stabbed Zaaki and
  that he had been injured when he jumped between them trying to protect his
  friend. Petra Williams said: “They were going to charge him for murder if he
  didn’t tell them who it was … They were giving him a hard time.” When asked if
  her son had been convinced it was Shannon, she said “I think so” and then
  added: “I don’t really know because Rhys doesn’t really talk much.” Williams,
  34, has been working as a hip-hop artist under the alias Bisk and rapping
  about life in London. He was released from prison last month after pleading
  guilty to common assault. He was given an 18-week sentence, which he had
  already served awaiting trial. He did not respond to the Guardian’s questions
  about his testimony against Shannon. Shannon admits he was among a group of
  about 20 young men who were in the stairwell that night. But he has said he
  had gone to collect drugs from around the corner at the time that the stabbing
  took place. The Guardian has also spoken to a witness who was in the stairwell
  above where the stabbing took place that night and was interviewed by police
  but never called to give evidence at the trial. The witness, who did not want
  to be named, said he had only seen Shannon earlier that evening and that he
  did not see him among those running away from the scene of the attack when he
  looked after hearing commotion below. The witness also said he bumped into
  Williams a couple of years after the trial and that Williams said Shannon
  “took the rap for everyone”. He said that when he then asked what Williams
  meant, Williams said “basically everyone put the blame on Kai”. The witness
  said he could not envisage Shannon killing someone and that he did not think
  the right man was in prison. According to emails, Shannon’s defence team
  decided with less than a month to go before the trial not to call seven
  witnesses who were there that night on the principle of “don’t call them
  unless we absolutely need them”. Max Harris, who was Shannon’s solicitor at
  the time and now runs a microbrewery in Wales, said the case was one that had
  stayed with him as a potential miscarriage of justice. “This one for me has
  always had a question mark over it,” he said, “It’s always troubled me.” He
  said he was most concerned by the way police had initially misled Shannon into
  believing his DNA was on the knife. In fact, all they had was tiny fragments
  that could not eliminate Shannon but did not identify anyone. Shannon is
  pinning his hope on the case being sent back to the court of appeal by the
  CCRC. Shannon applied to it last year with the help of the Manchester
  Innocence Project and Graham Satchwell, a retired detective. Among the issues
  the CCRC is considering is a covert recording of a conversation between
  Shannon and Williams from 2014 about how Shannon came to be convicted. In it,
  Williams tells Shannon: “You [were] the sacrifice.” When Shannon says he did
  not kill anyone, Williams answers: “I know, I know.” When Shannon says he
  should not be in prison, Williams responds: “I know that … I know this.”
  Williams expresses regret about testifying against Shannon, saying: “It breaks
  my fucking heart, fam. I had to come Old Bailey and fucking do that.” Williams
  also appears to suggest on the call that he acted with other gang members to
  blame Shannon for Zaaki’s killing, saying: “It was a group decision … A group
  decision was made for this to happen.” When Shannon first applied to the CCRC
  with the recording, among other evidence, it took the commission more than
  three years to decide to reject the case. It said the meaning of the recording
  was not clear enough, that the conversation was elliptical and full of slang
  and that nowhere in it did Williams make any categorical statement that
  Shannon did not commit the murder. Afterwards, Shannon’s lawyer asked if the
  CCRC would at least conduct fresh forensic testing of the knife and other
  exhibits, given advancements in forensic science. The CCRC refused. Shannon
  said in a letter to the Guardian: “I feel that in 2015 the CCRC had more than
  enough evidence that pointed towards my innocence but for whatever reason it
  was not pursued and I was told I must remain in prison. “I can completely
  understand that a man died and the public and his family want to see a
  conviction but it must be the correct person. I was no angel in 2009 but I was
  and am still no murderer. I have been scapegoated by ex-associates and the
  authorities.” A CCRC spokesperson said: “Mr Shannon has made two applications
  to the CCRC. The first application did not result in a referral. We have
  received a second application in relation to this case. A review into this
  application is ongoing. It would be inappropriate for us to discuss the case
  or make any further comment while the application is being reviewed.” A Met
  police spokesperson said: “We are aware of the case and that it is currently
  being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. We are unable to
  comment on any specific matters relating to the original investigation while
  this process is ongoing.”
