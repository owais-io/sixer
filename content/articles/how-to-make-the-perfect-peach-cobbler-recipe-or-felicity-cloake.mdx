  “If you go to a picnic in the south,” wrote the late South Carolina chef Emily
  Meggett, “and there’s no peach cobbler, someone’s got some explaining to do.”
  Cobblers, a rustic variety of fruit pie that seems to have originated in the
  rough-and-ready environs of the American west, are now principally associated
  with the US south and are, as chef Brad McDonald observes, “unglamorous” yet
  “rarely fail to please”. As befits frontier food, they’re extremely adaptable
  to a variety of climates and kitchens, too, but, as the southern food critic
  James Villas once explained, “no matter how you construct a hot cobbler, the
  main principle is that the filling should never be either soggy or dried out
  and the crust must be crisp enough to create a good counterpoint with the soft
  fruits or berries – not to mention the obligatory scoop of ice-cream on top”.
  Far easier to pull off than a pie, but more impressive than a crumble,
  cobblers are a great way to use a bargain tray of overripe or bruised fruit,
  should you be lucky to come across such a thing. The fruit Peaches, obviously
  – but peaches in the UK will not usually be as fresh as those in the American
  south, which means we have to adjust our expectations accordingly. A couple of
  recipes call explicitly for “ripe but firm” fruit, which does not mean those
  cannonballs sold as ready-to-eat in many British retailers; I speak from
  bitter experience when I assure you that a peach that is crunchy when raw will
  still be al dente once baked. Though not squashy, the fruit ought to give a
  little under your fingertips (a good fruit vendor should be happy to pick some
  out for you, though sadly our supermarkets do not offer that service, so
  you’ll have to take it on trust or do some discreet and gentle squeezing).
  That said, even in the south, there’s a delightfully bitchy hierarchy of
  peaches, with Villas instructing the reader of The Glory of Southern Cooking
  to “forget most of what you’ve heard about Georgia peaches. Yes, Georgia
  peaches are certainly far superior to the pulpy, bitter peaches they grow in
  California, but where I go for sweet peach perfection is to the South Carolina
  Piedmont region, intersected by Interstate 77 and, more specifically, to the
  Peach Tree and other orchards in and around Filbert. Peach fanatics from as
  far away as Pennsylvania and Kentucky flock to the Peach Tree every summer to
  see and smell and taste the luscious early belles, white ladies, lorings and
  indian red clings”. Meanwhile, I head to the greengrocers. Controversially, I
  will not be peeling the fruit. Everyone peels the fruit, I know, because they
  seem to have an aversion to what America’s Test Kitchen (ATK) terms “any
  unpleasantly leathery bits of skin”, but, as with apples, tomatoes and even
  potatoes, I happen to like a bit of chew – a skinless peach feels like a
  tinned peach to me, and though tinned peaches have their place (a hotel
  breakfast buffet), it’s not what I’m after here. Plus, a ripe peach is a pain
  to peel. (I can almost hear the southerners murderously murmuring: “Bless her
  heart”). The juices Ripe peaches are a very wet fruit, which proves a problem
  in recipes such as the one in McDonald’s book Deep South, where they’re used
  raw – this proves the first clue to perhaps the most important lesson I learn
  about peach cobbler: the dish should always be placed on a rimmed baking
  sheet, because if it can bubble over, you can bet your bottom dollar it will.
  Cutting the fruit into chunky wedges, as he suggests, rather than slices, is a
  good start; too thin, and they have a tendency to dissolve into perfumed mush
  in the oven. Like ATK , McDonald uses cornflour to thicken those juices (Edna
  Lewis prefers plain flour) but, to my mind, more muscular action is required
  to stem the tide. While this shouldn’t be a dry dish, equally, too much juice
  will make the topping soggy. Chef Joe Randall’s recipe in the book he
  co-authored with Toni Tipton-Martin, A Taste of Heritage, marinates his
  peaches with sugar, flour and spices to draw out the juices, then simmers them
  until those juices start to thicken – yet with similarly liquid results. I’m
  beginning to suspect that ATK’s claim that “most of the juices are not
  released until the peaches are almost fully cooked” is correct. My multi-prong
  solution, like ATK’s, is to drain off some of the liquid produced by mixing
  peaches with sugar and leaving them to sit, then to thicken that with
  cornflour and to pre-bake the fruit before adding the topping, to give that
  liquid more time to evaporate, as well as to leave enough gaps in said topping
  to encourage further evaporation. The flavouring Everyone uses sugar,
  naturally, and some in quantities that are a little too much for those not
  weaned on sweet tea. Randall’s dark brown sugar feels a little too treacly for
  this fresh fruit, but I like the idea of a lighter brown sugar with peaches –
  it just feels apt somehow. Almost everyone adds butter to their filling – I
  want to say it’s too much, but I’m afraid it does help make the syrup
  deliciously rich, so omit it at your own risk. Lewis, or Miss Lewis as she was
  properly called and is always referred to in her book with Scott Peacock, The
  Gift of Southern Cooking, also adds a pinch of salt, which, like the lemon
  juice in Meggett’s, Randall’s and the ATK recipes, helps to make the peaches
  taste … peachier somehow. If you happen to have some knocking around, I’d also
  highly recommend a dash of the almond essence in Villas’ recipe – not so much
  as to make the filling taste nutty, but just enough to enhance the flavour of
  the almond’s close cousin, the peach. McDonald mixes the peaches with
  raspberries – which, personally, I don’t care for when cooked (they break down
  completely in the peach juice, but if you like the idea, stick a handful in).
  She also adds vanilla and cinnamon, which we all like less than Miss Lewis and
  Randall’s nutmeg; peaches and sugar are sweet enough, after all, without
  enhancing that with cloyingly sweet spices. Randall’s ground cloves prove a
  surprise hit, but one spice feels like quite enough in a place where peaches
  hardly grow on trees. The topping I thought I knew what a cobbler was until I
  started the research for this dish and found myself rolling out a lovely,
  delicately crumbly pastry for Randall’s double-crust version. Peacock
  helpfully explains that “in the US south, the term ‘cobbler’ is applied to a
  host of baked fruit desserts. To Miss Lewis, ‘cobbler’ meant a kind of
  deep-dish pie with fruit baked between a bottom and top layer of pastry … to
  other southern bakers, a cobbler might have only a top pastry crust. In
  Alabama, we called anything a cobbler that had fruit covered by a baked
  topping.” (He goes on to reminisce about “one of the more distinctive cobblers
  of my childhood”, from a local barbecue joint, that involved “canned peaches
  covered with a box of Duncan Hines Yellow Cake mix – dry – with melted butter
  poured over the top”.) The most distinctive cobbler I try comes from Meggett’s
  book, Gullah Geechee Home Cooking, co-authored with Kayla Stewart and Trelani
  Michelle, on the Lowcountry cuisine of coastal South Carolina, and
  particularly her lifelong home, Edisto Island. Instead of a top crust, the
  dish is filled with a buttery sponge batter topped with peaches – it’s light,
  fluffy and very quick to make, though, good as all the recipes are, I like the
  scone-like toppings in McDonald and the ATK recipes best; if I’m serving up
  something called a cobbler, I don’t want it to feel like a pie or an
  upside-down cake, but something distinctively different, as well as
  emphatically American. Both recipes use fluffy drop biscuits, rather than the
  flakier rolled kind – for a British audience, these are more like dumplings
  than rowies/butteries – which makes sense, because they’re better suited to
  soaking up juice (and, in keeping with the spirit of the cobbler, much quicker
  and easier to make). The method is similar to scones, but uses a wetter dough,
  moistened with McDonald’s tangy buttermilk, which my testers prefer to the
  more neutral but richer yoghurt in the ATK recipe. But we all agree some
  raising agent is required; an unleavened dough, though tasty, does have
  tendency to sit heavy as a stone upon the fruit. Adding it to a filling that’s
  already hot helps it to cook through in time, and though the biscuit itself
  shouldn’t be too sweet, in contrast to what lies beneath, a final topping of
  granulated sugar adds a delightful crunch. The accompaniments Miss Lewis
  served her peach cobbler with “an unusual” (but very tasty) nutmeg syrup, but
  more common pairings are vanilla ice-cream (McDonald and Randall), whipped
  cream (ATK) and even, non-canonically, creme fraiche or yoghurt. But ice-cream
  is, in my opinion, the American dream. (Note that this is good served warm as
  well as well as hot, but not chilled, because that makes the topping turn a
  little doughy. You could marinate the peaches in advance, but don’t make the
  biscuit dough until just before baking.) Perfect peach cobbler Prep 10 min
  Marinate 30 min+ Cook 45 min+ Rest 15 min Serves 6 About 800g ripe but fairly
  firm peaches (about 4-5 medium-sized ones) 2 tbsp soft light brown or demerara
  sugar, or white sugar if preferred A pinch of salt 15g butter, diced, plus
  extra for greasing 1½ tsp cornflour 1 tbsp lemon juice ¼ tsp almond extract
  (optional) ½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg Ice-cream, to serve For the topping
  100g cold butter 175g plain flour 2 tbsp caster sugar ¼ tsp fine salt 1 tsp
  baking powder 150ml buttermilk, or 145ml milk mixed with 1 tsp lemon juice or
  vinegar 1 tbsp demerara sugar Cut the peaches into chunky wedges, scatter with
  the sugar and salt, then leave to sit at room temperature for at least 30
  minutes. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7, and grease a baking dish just
  large enough to hold all the fruit in a single layer. Grate or dice the 100g
  butter for the topping and put it in the freezer. Drain the juice from the
  steeped peaches and reserve. Arrange the drained peaches in the base of the
  rimmed baking dish. Put the cornflour in a small bowl, stir in two tablespoons
  of the reserved peach juice, plus the lemon juice and almond extract, if
  using, until dissolved, then toss this mix and the nutmeg with the peaches.
  Top with the diced butter. Put the peach dish on a rimmed baking tray, pop the
  lot in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, until the juices are bubbling.
  Meanwhile, put the flour, caster sugar, salt and baking powder for the topping
  in a large bowl. Add the frozen grated butter, toss to coat, then rub in with
  your fingertips just until the mix resembles coarse crumbs with visible pieces
  of butter still in there – it shouldn’t be fully rubbed in. Once the peaches
  are bubbling, turn down the oven to 200 (180C fan)/gas 6 and stir the
  buttermilk into the flour to make a wet, shaggy dough. Dollop this on top of
  the fruit, leaving spaces between the blobs for them to expand. Top with a
  sprinkling of demerara sugar and bake for another 30-35 minutes, until golden.
  Remove, leave to cool for at least 15 minutes, then serve with ice-cream. •
