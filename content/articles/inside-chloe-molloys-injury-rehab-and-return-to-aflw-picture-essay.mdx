  “My knee ruled my whole world,” the Sydney Swans forward Chloe Molloy says,
  reflecting on her past year. As one of the AFLW’s leading players, she had
  been primed to propel the Swans towards the finals in 2024. But in training
  before the second round, she felt pain in her right knee. “I felt like,
  heading into the season last year, I’d really honed in on being a full-time
  footballer,” she says. “And then I got told ‘you’ve done your knee’.” Molloy
  Runs sprints at Tramway Oval on 13 June She didn’t want her teammates to worry
  before their second match, so she tried to keep secret her injury’s severity.
  But while they were on the field preparing, word got around. The Swans lost by
  16 points to the Saints, the first defeat in a season that – without Molloy –
  saw them underachieve. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly
  newsletter The then 25-year-old faced her own adversity. She had experienced
  back and foot injuries in the past, but this was different. “Nothing prepares
  you for an ACL. Holy moly, the ACL is a different beast,” she says. “You take
  a graft from your hamstring to turn it into a ligament, and you just can’t
  speed up that process.” Molloy recovers from her ACL injury. Running sprints.
  Infrared sauna at Rehub in Bondi, stretching and physio. In the early weeks,
  she was either on crutches or on the couch, icing her knee in agony. And that
  was before the rehabilitation began. “Running patterns, running lines, turning
  direction, tedious, tedious, tedious drills that you have to respect, but they
  friggin’ suck.” She admits it was a difficult time. Her family was in
  Victoria, her partner in Queensland. She wondered why she was doing it at all,
  given a return to professional sport meant a good chance she could do her knee
  again. And although she was co-captain of the Swans, Molloy didn’t want to
  impose herself on her teammates. “You don’t want to put your stuff on someone
  else’s plate, especially being in season and as a leader,” she says. “I felt
  like my responsibility was to protect my teammates, and make sure that they
  were preparing the best they could.” Molloy uses a Biodex machine, which
  measures an athlete’s power, strength and stability She channelled her
  energies into her rehabilitation, targeting a return for round one this year.
  Her surgeon described her as “overconfident”, yet still she hit the
  milestones. “When you see me on that machine, it’s a test that you need to
  pass,” she says, recalling the photograph of her seated and lifting her leg.
  “I hope I never have to sit on one of those machines again.” But through the
  repetition, the routine, came something else. She began to recognise that this
  was an opportunity, and the time in the gym could provide her a new edge. She
  revisited her whole lifestyle – from nutrition, to sleep – to see what she
  could refine. “Every decision I made was about … how much time am I on my
  feet, what shoes am I wearing, am I setting myself up for success,” she says.
  “I’d finish one session, and I’d already start thinking about the next one.”

  Molloy returned to play in a warm-up match, one month ahead of schedule. After
  two outings this AFLW season, she leads the competition with 11 goals and her
  side is unbeaten. But ahead of Saturday’s clash against Geelong, she admits
  she doesn’t want to “get too ahead of myself”. Though her knee once ruled her
  world, now there is more to it. “What rules my world now is showing up for my
  teammates,” she says. “Making sure I’m not letting the person next to me down
  in whatever I’m doing.”
