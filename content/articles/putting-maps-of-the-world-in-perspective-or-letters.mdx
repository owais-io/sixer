  I hope that the view that Mercator’s projection is “the world’s most popular
  map” is incorrect (Editorial, 22 August). Most modern world maps show
  distributions; relative densities are what matters. Equal-area projections are
  required, and using Mercator for such purposes is geographical illiteracy.
  With digital data and computer programs, many different equal-area projections
  are at everyone’s fingertips: cylindrical, azimuthal, conic – and oblique or
  recentred versions of any. Geographers were using these long before the Peters
  projection and Equal Earth were promoted. Shape distortion can be reduced by
  intersecting the Earth at two standard parallels or meridians, or by
  interruption – as in the widely used gores of the universal transverse
  Mercator projection. Projections can be focused on any area of interest: the
  best for Africa could cut the Earth at two standard parallels (10 and 30
  degrees east), or a 2,000km radius circle centred somewhere around the Central
  African Republic. But any map boundary is unreal. The Mercator projection was
  adopted for navigation, whether for trade, exploration or colonialism. It
  shows the correct shape of small areas and portrays compass directions as
  straight lines, but does not show shortest routes. All geographers will want
  to see less use of a world map that exaggerates/emphasises Greenland, Russia
  and Canada. And all statesmen should have a proper globe in their offices. Dr
  Ian S Evans Emeritus reader in geography, University of Durham • I understand
  why the African Union seeks to replace the biased Mercator projection of our
  world with an alternative such as Equal Earth. But why stop there? In 1998,
  the splendid new rock’n’roll musical Kat and the Kings left its home in Cape
  Town, South Africa, and toured the UK. Towards the end of the show, the cast
  broke from character to say that they would perform some music and dance from
  their own culture and traditions. They added: “We are from South Africa, which
  is at the top of the world”. Mark Everett Faversham, Kent • In Moscow in 1999,
  I visited the office of a Scottish consulting engineer, and on the wall was a
  map of the northern hemisphere with Russia at its centre. It’s easy to see why
  Putin has become so obsessed with Russia’s importance. Maybe he needs to get a
  different map? David Cockayne Lymm, Cheshire • Have an opinion on anything
  you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
  considered for publication in our letters section.
