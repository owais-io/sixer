  Good to have it confirmed that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will be talking
  about Ukraine behind its back on Friday in Alaska, as the US president rambled
  through a press conference on Monday in which he explained that Putin “wasn’t
  going to mess with me” and that Ukraine was going to have to accept new
  borders. And listen – you’ll agree that territorial pronouncements mean so
  much more coming from a guy whose staff once shamelessly redrew a hurricane
  impact map to stop him looking stoopid. It’s a true honour for the Ukrainians
  to see their country effectively carved up by someone who would prefer to
  post-rationalise any old crap with a Sharpie than admit he doesn’t have the
  first clue about it and cares even less. Leave it to the tasteful visionary
  behind the Gaza Riviera to categorise what he’s doing as trying to get back
  some of Ukraine’s “oceanfront property”. “In real estate we call it oceanfront
  property,” Trump said on Monday, demystifying this term of high art for
  non-developers who haven’t contrived to bankrupt several Atlantic City
  casinos. “That’s always the most valuable property.” Thanks, Mister Mogul! It
  is assumed that the stretch of high-end primo coastline Trump was referring to
  included Mariupol, the utterly ruined port in which many thousands of
  civilians perished during the Russian siege. In international law we call it a
  possible war crime; in real estate we call it … what? Strategic
  pre-construction? Spa-chitecture? Certainly, how we put things is a matter of
  concern to this supremely sensitive president, who can find words very hurty,
  particularly when allied to optional concepts such as truth or the law. “I was
  a little bothered by the fact Zelenskyy was saying, ‘I have to get
  constitutional approval,’” he whined on Monday of the Ukrainian leader’s
  desire to put any peace deal to the Ukrainian people via a referendum. “He’s
  got approval to go into war and kill everybody?” Again, whether Ukraine
  “go[ing] into war” is a fair categorisation of its being invaded by Russia is
  not something that bothers the Sharpie king of the White House. As for the
  precise nature of the forthcoming cartography, Trump spent quite a lot of time
  talking suspiciously nebulously about “land swapping”. Can you swap things on
  behalf of someone who doesn’t want to swap them, and without them being
  present at the table? If so, I would like someone to swap me one of Trump’s
  second-tier golf courses, and would expect him to be very relaxed about it.
  He’ll just have to take my word that it’s in the wider interests of everybody.
  In terms of what he deems to be the interests of interested parties, there has
  been some strong suggestion in recent days that the Trump administration
  thinks it would be a win for Ukraine to abandon the bits of the Donetsk and
  Luhansk regions that are not even occupied by Russia, with only a ceasefire
  and the promise of some future better deal to show for it. Which would
  certainly be the absolute wrongest reading of a land deal since the New York
  Tribune called the Alaska purchase a folly and a waste of money. In fact, it
  would explain Putin’s willingness to travel to that very territory to hold
  Friday’s peace talks instead of doing it on neutral turf – you can probably
  afford to concede on the meeting location if everything else is likely to be
  such a complete gift to you. The Russian president might even bring along
  another hideously flattering portrait of Trump as an ice-breaking present,
  having already commissioned one as a personal gift earlier this year, which
  was passed on to Trump via his special envoy Steve Witkoff. Witkoff said it
  was a “beautiful portrait” and that the president was “clearly touched by it”.
  And so to the buildup to Friday. We’ll have to see how excited Trump gets
  about the chance to join some sort of German-organised conference call with
  European leaders on Wednesday. For the US president, the negotiating table is
  a place that seats only two people, one of which should always be him. For
  Putin, many fear through bitter experience, the negotiating table is a place
  where you simply obfuscate and buy time to regroup before renewing aggression.
  Rather like Holly Golightly at the window of Tiffany’s, nothing very bad can
  happen to Putin in Alaska. Merely turning up avoids the threatened sanctions.
  If, as seems likely, Trump decides he should be appeased with some land, any
  Ukrainian refusal to rubber-stamp this would leave him frustrated with and
  lashing out at Zelenskyy, not Putin. (Give the orange guy his peace deal and
  then his peace prize, dammit! He’s getting bored out here.) And if a ceasefire
  is somehow agreed, it would surely, on the form book, be regarded by Putin
  merely as a strategic buying of time. The Russian leader is obsessed with
  Ukraine in a way the Trump administration seems incapable of, or indifferent
  to, grasping. Look, maybe geopolitics really will turn out to be just a
  simpler version of commercial real estate. Maybe someone who has lost almost
  as many fortunes as he has gained in that particular trade really will turn
  out to be a maverick master whose refresh-the-parts traditional diplomacy
  can’t reach. Maybe! But the sheer lack of jeopardy for Putin in Alaska feels
  far more significant than the mood music. The best-case scenario is that
  Europe and Ukraine prepare themselves for the artlessness of the deal. The
  worst-case scenario is a darker pathway altogether – and one we seem
  increasingly likely to stumble on to. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist
