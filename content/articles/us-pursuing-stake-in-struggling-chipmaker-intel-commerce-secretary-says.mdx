  The US government is pursuing a stake in Intel, the US commerce secretary said
  on Tuesday, confirming reports of discussions between officials and the
  company that have circulated for the better part of a week. The Trump
  administration wants to convert funding from the Chips and Science Act, which
  funds research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips in the US, into equity
  in the struggling tech company, according to Howard Lutnick. Intel was once a
  leader in producing computer processors, but is now seen as a laggard behind
  the likes of Nvidia, which last month became the first public company in
  history to scale a $4tn valuation after a stratospheric stock market rise.
  Lutnick criticized the structure of the Chips Act, signed into law in 2022
  under Joe Biden. “Why are we giving a company worth $100bn this kind of money?
  What is in it for the American taxpayer? And the answer Donald Trump has is we
  should get an equity stake for our money,” he told the CNBC financial news
  network. “So we’ll deliver the money which was already committed under the
  Biden administration, we’ll get equity in return for it.” Shares in Intel
  rallied 7.5% in New York. The conversion of the funding would not confer
  governing rights typical of a company’s largest shareholder to the federal
  government, according to Lutnick. “It’s not governance, we’re just converting
  what was a grant under Biden into equity. Non-voting,” he said. Lutnick did
  say the goal of the equity stake would be much the same as that of the Chips
  Act, bluntly stating: “We need to make our own chips here. We cannot rely on
  Taiwan.” A large portion of the world’s semiconductors originate from Taiwan
  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), based in the city of Hsinchu. TSMC
  has also received Chips Act funding to build semiconductor manufacturing
  facilities in the US, with construction beginning in Arizona. The US treasury
  secretary, Scott Bessent, also said on Tuesday that a potential stake would
  not oblige US businesses to purchase Intel chips. “The last thing we’re going
  to do is take a stake and then try to drum up business,” he told CNBC. “The
  stake would be a conversion of the grants and maybe increase the investment
  into Intel to help stabilize the company for chip production here in the US.
  There’s no talk of trying to force companies to buy from Intel.” The prospect
  of large US investment in Intel has reinvigorated investor interest in the
  company, whose stock value has declined by half over the past five years.
  Shares jumped last week after initial reports of discussions with the US
  government, and the Japanese conglomerate Softbank announced late on Monday
  that it would take a $2bn stake in the company.
