  Immigration advocates alarmed over detention of Daca recipient: ‘No legal
  basis’

  Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago had already made it past the security line at the
  El Paso airport when two border patrol agents called her in for questioning
  and whisked her away to an immigration detention center. Nearly a month after
  her arrest, she and her family still aren’t clear why she is detained.
  Santiago is a beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca)
  program – which has allowed her to legally live and work in the US. “They have
  no legal basis for why they detained her or why they’re holding her or why
  they’re trying to deport her,” said her spouse, Desiree Miller. And
  immigration officials have yet to provide her or her family any clear answers,
  she added. Since her arrest on 3 August, Santiago’s case has alarmed
  immigration advocates across the US, as it illustrates the increasing
  vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of young people who arrived in the US
  as children and were granted temporary protections from deportation through
  the Obama-era Daca program. Although there have been no regulatory changes to
  the program, the administration has tried to strip 525,000 Daca recipients,
  also known as Dreamers, of benefits. In July, Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS
  assistant press secretary, claimed, falsely, that “Daca does not confer any
  form of legal status in this country” and urged recipients to self-deport.
  Earlier this month, Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf and mute Daca recipient was
  detained during a raid at his work site, and officials confiscated the tools
  he relied on to communicate. Jose Valdovinos, another Daca recipient, was
  detained outside a gas station, while in the passenger seat of a vehicle being
  driven by his wife. “We hadn’t seen this before,” said José, Santiago’s older
  brother – who is also a Daca recipient. “It was very fast and very
  aggressive.” On Wednesday, Santiago is set to appear at a hearing before an
  immigration judge – which will determine whether she will be released back
  home, or remain in detention. In the weeks since Santiago’s arrest, activists
  have organized vigils in El Paso, Texas; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Grand
  Rapids, Michigan; Long Island, Boston; Tempe, Arizona and Seattle to protest
  the detaining of the 28-year-old immigration rights activist and community
  organizer. Meanwhile, immigration officials told Santiago and her lawyers they
  wanted to deport her because she had entered the US illegally. “It didn’t make
  sense,” said Miller. Santiago had come to the US with her family when she was
  just eight years old, and was legally allowed to remain in the US through the
  Daca program. The Department of Homeland Security said she was arrested due to
  charges of “trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia”. But
  Santiago had not been convicted of any crimes, Miller said – and her record
  had not prevented her from renewing her Daca status seven times. “The
  administration is messaging that they’re deporting criminals and illegal
  aliens. And like they use all these words to try to take away from the fact
  that the people who are being detained are human, that they are family
  members,” Miller said. Santiago had been on her way to Austin to attend a
  conference on family and community-run farms when she was arrested. Miller,
  who works alongside Santiago at the local community organization, had caught
  an earlier flight to attend the same conference. Miller was rattled when
  Santiago sent them a shaky video of two border patrol officers stopping her at
  the airport, insisting she put her phone away and come with them to answer
  questions about her employment documents. Then, for the next several hours,
  Miller heard nothing. “I was messaging and calling her.” Santiago had been
  stopped at airports before, so Miller hoped the silence was an indication that
  she had boarded her flight. A few hours later, Santiago had managed to call a
  friend from a detention center. Miller rushed back home. In the weeks that
  followed, Santiago told her spouse and family she was unable to sleep because
  the lights at the detention center were on all night and the guards were loud.
  She found it difficult to eat the food that was provided and get medical care
  as needed. José said he could hear the exhaustion in her voice. “But I know
  she has a strong spirit,” he said. Miller said they’ve been unable to rest.
  “It’s really hard for me to like, sleep and eat and do anything out here
  comfortably, knowing that she’s not able to sleep in there,” they said. The
  couple married in January – and since Miller is a US citizen, Santiago had
  been considering applying for a green card soon. “It’s like the constant
  threat that they could come and take someone you love.”
