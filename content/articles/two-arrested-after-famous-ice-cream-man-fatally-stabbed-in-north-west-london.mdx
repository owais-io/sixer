  Two people have been arrested after an ice-cream man was fatally stabbed in
  broad daylight in north-west London. The Metropolitan police said they
  received reports of a stabbing in Monks Park, Wembley shortly after 6pm on
  Tuesday. Medics treated a man for stab wounds before he died at the scene, the
  force said. Police later named him as 41-year-old Shazad Khan. A 26-year-old
  man was arrested on suspicion of murder early on Wednesday. A 31-year-old
  woman was also arrested at the scene for conspiracy to murder. Both remain in
  custody. Local resident Asim Mahmood Butt, 39, said he was a childhood friend
  of the victim, who he described as a “famous ice-cream guy” in the area. Butt
  told the PA news agency that the victim began selling ice-cream “about a year
  ago” and his van, which was parked on the road at the time of the incident,
  was well known locally for featuring a large teddy bear. Another witness, who
  spoke to PA on the condition of anonymity, said the ice-cream van was towed
  away from the scene in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The victim’s
  family has been informed of his death and are being provided with specialist
  support, the Met said. Det Ch Supt Luke Williams said: “Our thoughts remain
  with Shazad’s family and friends at this unimaginably difficult time. “This
  incident will rightly cause concern across the community but intelligence at
  this stage leads us to believe there is no wider threat to the public.” Walker
  urged residents to look at doorbell or dashcam footage around Monks Park and
  contact police “as a matter of urgency” if any information linked to the
  incident was found. The Met said people might see a rise in the number of
  officers in the local area as the police investigation continues. A blue
  forensics tent and Met officers could be seen inside a police cordon in Monks
  Park on Wednesday afternoon. Anyone with information has been asked to contact
  police by calling 101 or online by quoting CAD6174/19AUG. Alternatively, the
  Crimestoppers charity can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through
  an online form.
