  Portia Woodman-Wickliffe had already cemented her legendary status in rugby
  before making more history against Japan. So much has been said about the
  winger, with the former Black Fern Kendra Cocksedge saying she “isn’t human”
  and the New Zealand star Ruby Tui describing her as “out of this world”. On
  Sunday Woodman-Wickliffe became New Zealand’s all-time record try‑scorer as
  the side secured their quarter-final place with a big win. Woodman-Wickliffe
  moved one ahead of Doug Howlett, who scored 49 tries in 62 Tests, while the
  Black Ferns wing reached her 50 tries in 30 Tests. She also added to her
  record number of World Cup tries which now stands at 22. Asked if there are
  any more records for her to break, the 34-year-old Woodman-Wickliffe replied:
  “Plenty. I don’t know what they are but it is a testament to the team. I had
  to tell my mum ‘don’t talk about it’, there is so much external pressure about
  it. I thought: ‘I am going to score this one and get it done and out of the
  way and then I don’t have to think about it for the rest of the game.’
  “Ultimately it is the team, my job is to finish what the team creates. If I
  can do that and it adds to the records, so be it, but in my mind that has
  nothing to do with what I do. I just go out there and do my job.” Braxton
  Sorensen-McGee also laid down a marker, the full-back scoring an impressive
  hat-trick and kicking four conversions, while the back-row Jorja Miller ran in
  two tries. Silence descended over Sandy Park for the Haka but there was a
  rumbling of “ooo” as Japan formed an arrow and moved forward into a line to
  lay down their own challenge to New Zealand. The Black Ferns legend Tui was
  sitting just in front of the press box and she stood and followed along with
  the Haka too, rippling the atmosphere into the stands. Less than a minute into
  the game the Japan full-back Sora Nishimura was injured after colliding with
  one of her teammates and it invigorated the players. They scored one of the
  best team tries of the tournament so far with the wing Sakurako Hatada
  finishing well. But you blink and New Zealand can turn a game around, and they
  did just that with Woodman-Wickliffe’s try. The score was a pretty special
  piece of individual skill but Miller’s score next somehow eclipsed it, she ran
  a lovely line and evaded two defenders. Katelyn Vahaakolo, Sorensen-McGee and
  Kennedy Tukuafu all scored before Haruka Hirotsu received a yellow card which
  was sent for a bunker review for a high tackle but it remained a sin‑bin only.
  The second half began with a New Zealand yellow card for the replacement
  back‑row Laura Bayfield for a deliberate knock‑on. Japan then scored a try as
  Moe Tsukui went over but it was not long until the Black Ferns added to their
  points with Sorensen‑McGee in for her second. Bayfield was shown a second
  yellow and so was given a red card for collapsing a maul, resulting in a Japan
  penalty try. New Zealand responded perfectly with a great try by Miller,
  Sorensen-McGee was in again and Renee Holmes also scored. It was a huge win
  for New Zealand but the Japan head coach, Lesley McKenzie, provided important
  context by saying there are fewer than 400 women playing rugby in the country.
  Japan are also a non-professional side; New Zealand have 45 full-time deals.
  Japan will play Spain in their final pool match, while New Zealand and Ireland
  will battle it out for the top of the pool next Sunday. One thing that is
  certain is Woodman-Wickliffe will continue to mark herself out as one of, if
  not, the game’s best.
