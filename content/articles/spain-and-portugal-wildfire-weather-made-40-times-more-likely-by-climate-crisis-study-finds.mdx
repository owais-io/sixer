  The extreme weather that fuelled “astonishing” blazes across Spain and
  Portugal last month was made 40 times more likely by climate breakdown, early
  analysis suggests. The deadly wildfires, which torched 500,000 hectares (1.2m
  acres) of the Iberian peninsula in a matter of weeks, were also 30% more
  intense than scientists would have expected in a world without climate change,
  according to researchers from the World Weather Attribution network. “The
  sheer size of these fires has been astonishing,” said Clair Barnes, a climate
  scientist at Imperial College London and co-author of the study. “Hotter,
  drier and more flammable conditions are becoming more severe with climate
  change, and are giving rise to fires of unprecedented intensity.” The
  researchers found that such conditions could have occurred once every 500
  years in the preindustrial climate, but in today’s world – which has been
  warmed by the heat-trapping pollution from burning coal, oil and gas – they
  could be expected every 15 years. The effects of climate breakdown on the
  extreme heat were even stronger, the researchers found. The 10-day maximum
  temperatures in the region last month were expected to hit every 2,500 years
  before industrialisation. They are now expected every 13 years. The study,
  which has not yet been submitted for peer review, relied on weather
  observations rather than analysis of climate models that the group usually
  conducts in the immediate aftermath of destructive weather. A fuller analysis
  of the Turkish and Greek wildfires they published last week found climate
  breakdown had made the extreme weather conditions 10 times more likely.
  Changes in land use have compounded the rising regional risk of untamed
  infernos. Several hot Mediterranean countries have struggled to deal with the
  effects of rural abandonment and ageing populations, as young people moving to
  cities have left behind unmanaged farmland with overgrown vegetation that can
  easily burn. David Garcia, an applied mathematician at the University of
  Alicante, said the public debate in Spain had focused on the decline of rural
  activities and the resulting growth of vegetation. “However, much less has
  been said about the effect of climate change on these fires, which, as has
  been demonstrated, has been immense.” Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime
  minister, announced details of a 10-point climate plan on Monday to respond to
  increasingly extreme weather. In an interview with the Guardian, the
  centre-left politician warned that climate action was being undermined by
  mainstream rightwing parties adopting the narratives of the far right. “The
  problem that we’re now facing is that there are traditional rightwing parties
  that perhaps don’t deny the scientific reality, but which act and behave as if
  climate change doesn’t exist. And this is the biggest problem,” Sánchez said.
