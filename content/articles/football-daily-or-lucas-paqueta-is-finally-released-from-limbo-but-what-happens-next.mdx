  OFF THE SPOT It’s taken almost two years but the good news is that if you bet
  on Lucas Paquetá to be cleared of those gambling charges you can finally go
  and collect. And if the 12 that signifies a hurricane is the highest measure
  on the Beaufort scale, you can almost certainly bet your bottom dollar that
  the West Ham midfielder’s sigh of relief upon discovering he had been cleared
  of spot-fixing accusations registered in the very high teens. Had Paquetá been
  found guilty of charges he deliberately got booked on multiple occasions so
  that assorted folk back home in Brazil could make the staggeringly
  insignificant sums reported to have been involved in this alleged global
  conspiracy, he was staring straight down the barrel of a lifetime ban from
  football. Having faced the possible ruin of his career and livelihood, not to
  mention the untold damage to his reputation that would have accompanied a
  guilty verdict, the 27-year-old is now free to continue playing, blissfully
  unencumbered by the giant boulder he has been carrying around on his shoulders
  since the accusations were levelled against him by the FA two years ago. And
  while he got there in the end and all’s well that ends well, it has now been
  suggested that both Paquetá and his famously litigious employers might now
  have grounds to sue the FA for both legal costs and the loss of tens of
  millions incurred by the entirely-related collapse of the player’s £85m move
  to Manchester City, shortly after the investigation was announced. “Since the
  first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these
  extremely serious accusations,” said Paquetá, who has been found guilty of two
  lesser charges of failing to cooperate fully with the investigation. “I can’t
  say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am
  to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my
  face.” Having given Paquetá their full support throughout his lengthy ordeal,
  West Ham will also be looking forward to seeing one of their best footballers
  back to his stress-free best, even if the smile on his face morphs into a
  rictus grin when he remembers he’s contracted to West Ham. Rumours abound that
  the Hammers may decide to cash in their chips while the player retains his
  value and there ought to be no shortage of takers at a decent price, albeit
  one around half that they negotiated with City. The smartish money currently
  suggests Paquetá could end up at Newcastle, who currently own more goalkeepers
  than midfielders but are rumoured to be on the verge of being forced into
  accepting a large windfall of their own. Place your bets. QUOTE OF THE DAY “I
  am urging Jason Whittingham once again to just sign the damn paperwork. This
  state of affairs shows exactly why we need the new football regulator” – Lizzi
  Collinge, Labour MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, makes a desperate plea to the
  Morecambe FC owner to sell up, after shareholders said it would “officially
  shut” and face “total collapse” in 72 hours without an 11th-hour takeover.
  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTER In today’s Rumour Mill, the author labelled Kieffer
  Moore as ‘prolific’ due to his record of 60 goals in 203 Championship games.
  It is hard to detect irony or sarcasm in the written form, and with no use of
  italics or other such such writing tropes, one had to take the sentence
  seriously. His goalscoring record, although not shabby, can’t be termed as
  prolific. At an average of one goal every 3.4 games, extrapolated across a
  full Championship season, works out at just 13 goals for the league campaign
  after 44 matches. If that is now prolific, then going by the Moore Goals Ratio
  Method, my 14 goals in the 1990 season of the Primary 5 Glasgow School League
  also meant I had a prolific year” – Paul ‘Goals’ Kenealy. If you have any,
  please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our
  prizeless letter o’ the day is … Paul ‘Goals’ Kenealy. Terms and conditions
  for our competitions, when we run them, are here. Which you’ll need for next
  week when we’ll have prizes back once again. RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday
  11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and a host of your other
  Football Weekly favourites live on stage for an evening of unfiltered football
  punditry at Troxy in London and livestreamed globally. Book now. This is an
