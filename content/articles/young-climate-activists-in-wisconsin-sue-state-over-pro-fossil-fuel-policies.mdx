  Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, on Friday sued the state of
  Wisconsin over its pro-fossil fuel policies. The case provides the opportunity
  for state officials to “make the correct step to decarbonize Wisconsin”
  because of the “climate harms they’ve caused youth”, said Kaarina, 17, who is
  the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Kaarina grew up in the state’s Vernon
  county along the Mississippi River. But in 2023, a large boulder rolled into
  her backyard and knocked over trees. Concerned for their safety, her family
  decided to relocate, but could not find an affordable home in the county that
  was safe from floods, which the climate crisis has made more common and
  severe. They were forced to move an hour north to La Crosse county. Incidents
  like the one Kaarina experienced are occurring more frequently in Wisconsin,
  as winter thawing and subsequent refreezing cycles, known as “freeze-thaw
  events”, are increasing due to global heating. If it weren’t for the fossil
  fuel-driven climate crisis, Kaarina believes, her fate might have been
  different, as the boulder that tumbled toward her home would probably have
  never become dislodged. “I had to move away from the childhood I planned to
  live in my entire life and enjoy with my own children,” said Kaarina, who is
  using only her first name because she is a minor. The “incredibly traumatic
  and life-changing experience” helped inspire her to join the case, she said.
  The new lawsuit was filed by two non-profit law firms. The first, Our
  Children’s Trust, notched a landmark 2023 win in a Montana case when a judge
  ruled that the state’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated young challengers’
  state-given rights. The second, regional environmental justice law center
  Midwest Environmental Advocates, won a July case concerning Wisconsin public
  records law. In the new lawsuit, plaintiffs are specifically targeting two
  Wisconsin laws governing the state’s public service commission, which
  regulates utilities. One prohibits the regulator from considering toxic and
  planet-heating air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel power plants,
  while another bars it from requiring utilities to increase the amount of
  electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources. “These laws set up a system
  where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power
  plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” said Nate Bellinger,
  supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust. Wisconsin has pledged to
  transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, but today still obtains
  three-quarters of its electricity from fossil fuels. “The state legislature
  and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the
  electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of
  that.” The plaintiffs are aiming to have the two laws declared
  unconstitutional, which could ultimately lead to their overturning. The
  state’s constitution enshrines a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
  happiness, which the perpetuation of an oil and gas-based electricity sector
  impinges upon, the lawsuit argues. “We’ve argued that the fossil fuel
  pollution and climate impacts resulting from the approval of fossil fuel power
  plants is harming the plaintiff’s health, their homes, their property and
  their safety, and ultimately violating those constitutional rights to security
  and health,” Bellinger said. The challengers also say the constitution’s
  invocation of the public trust doctrine, which requires certain natural
  resources to be held in the government’s trust for the public’s benefit,
  should force Wisconsin to protect navigable waters for present and future
  generations, including from the climate crisis. Climate impacts on Wisconsin
  are mounting, including not only flooding and rapid freeze-thaw cycles but
  also wildfires, ecosystem degradation and increasing extreme heat. Each of
  these is taking a toll on local youth, the lawsuit says. “I coached tennis
  during the summer, but I recently did have to give it up due to such extreme
  weather and extreme climate events that don’t make it safe for me to be
  outside any more,” said Kaarina. “Also, my family enjoys gardening at my
  grandparents’ tree farm nearby, and my summers in the gardens have been cut
  short due to such extreme heat that does not make it safe to be outside, and
  extreme weather events that ultimately washes away the gardens that we’ve put
  so much incredible work into.” Plaintiffs have also experienced asthma
  worsened by the burning of fossil fuels, while Indigenous challengers have
  seen their access to traditional foods hampered by ecosystem degradation and
  warming waters, the lawsuit says. “Our clients are asking the court to uphold
  their right to a livable future,” said Tony Wilkin Gibart, executive director
  of Midwest Environmental Advocates. “This case is about whether they will
  inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate – or one burdened
  by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their
  health and safety.” The lawsuit comes as the federal government rolls back a
  slew of environmental rules and worked to boost fossil fuels. In May, Our
  Children’s Trust sued the Trump administration for some of its
  anti-environmental executive orders; the case will have a two-day evidentiary
  hearing next month. Donald Trump’s policies have made youth climate action
  even more important, particularly at the state level, said Kaarina. “There’s
  very many dark things going on in our world right now, and especially in our
  federal government,” she said. “However, I don’t think that that should squish
  the light that is in youth.”
