  The evening sun glints across the quiet marina, and the wooden gable ends of
  the houses lean gently into a street whose silence is broken only by the
  trundle of an occasional bicycle. I’m having a glass of inexpensive, decent
  wine in a waterside bar: and even on this picture-perfect night it’s quiet,
  with every customer around me speaking Dutch. This can’t be Amsterdam, can it?
  A city that’s overpriced, heaves with tourists, and is awash with busy canals
  and traffic. It feels a million miles away. In fact, the city centre is just
  20 minutes up the road, because this is Nieuwendam, whose houses date from as
  long ago as the 16th century, built atop the dyke that kept the sea at bay
  from the pasture land that grew the crops to feed the city. I’m drinking in
  Cafe ’t Sluisje, which for the last decade has been run by local residents.
  This is the most scenic quarter of Noord, the Amsterdam on the other side of
  the water from Centraal station. Noord is my home for the summer: my daughter
  and her Dutch partner live in Nieuwendam and I’m here to help with their baby,
  my first grandson. My childcare days are spent in leafy Noorderpark, or
  pushing the buggy through the shady woodland of Vliegenbos to the canal. A
  century ago this was Amsterdam’s industrial heartland, and the streets are
  lined with the uniform, steep-roofed houses built for the workers. Today,
  almost in response to the excesses on display down the road, the area is
  flexing its hippy, alternative, laid-back side: my walks take me past floating
  homes, the occupants of one of which keep goats and chickens in a repurposed
  fire engine. In summer, lives spill out onto the pavements: most houses have
  tables, chairs, even sofas outside their front doors, and a sunny evening
  quickly becomes a convivial street party. Down by the water, sculptures by
  local artists peek through the long grass, and you can jump into the canal for
  a swim. For visitors, nowhere sums up the vibe of Noord better than Cafe de
  Ceuvel, a former shipyard, now a collection of shabby-chic vintage houseboats
  permanently moored around a meandering boardwalk; they’re now artists’
  workshops and a yoga studio. The cafe is a glorious, colourful hotchpotch of
  recycled furniture, with some tables right at the water’s edge – it’s the
  perfect place to while away an afternoon drinking organic beers and wine. And
  if you need somewhere to stay, the Ceuvel has rooms in moored boats – its
  Hotel Asile Flottant has doubles from about €150 a night. Noord’s best-known
  area is another shipyard called NDSM, an open space larger than 10 football
  pitches that is home to myriad art galleries, museums and outdoor sculptures
  and installations. A free ferry transports you there in 15 minutes from
  Centraal Station – on the way, you get a good view of the futuristic,
  swan-like Eye Filmmuseum. This, along with the Nxt Museum of technology, are
  among the most-visited attractions in Noord. Also popular is Pllek, a
  collection of repurposed shipping containers where you can eat anything from a
  laid-back brunch to dinner, with meditation and yoga sessions and live music
  also on the menu. Movies are screened on its beach, which has stunning views
  over to the city. My advice, though, would be to venture a little further
  afield, to a street such as Johan van Hasseltweg, which stretches across the
  peninsula in the opposite direction from NDSM. This is the locals’ Noord, with
  its corrugated iron warehouses. Tourism is beginning to make its mark here,
  but only just: wedged between the long-established family businesses and
  garages are places such as Oedipus brewery, where you can try the citrusy,
  bestselling Bride, or the Pais Tropical, and which serves a melt-in-the-mouth
  smash burger. Nearby is Chateau Amsterdam, an urban winery and restaurant
  (open Wednesday to Saturday) where grapes from across Europe are used to make
  sauvignons and chardonnays, pinots and fizz. And at the very end of the
  street, where you’re again at the water’s edge, is another beach restaurant –
  De VerbroederIJ, with its own food garden and pigsty. If you want to push the
  boat out, you won’t need a boat at all: it’s a few minutes’ walk to Hangar, my
  favourite Noord restaurant. The food – mostly burgers and salad – and the wine
  are great. But it’s the ambience that makes it spectacular, with tables right
  by the water, and meals punctuated by giant barges cruising slowly by. Best of
  all, unlike many of the eateries in the “centrum”, it’s never packed. And
  beyond the area’s cool restaurants and vibe is the countryside – surprisingly
  close since 2018, when the metro’s line 52 expanded, making Noord station just
  a four-minute journey from Centraal. Take your bike (you can do this at
  off-peak times) and within a few minutes of arriving, you’ll be pedalling
  through lush fields and picturesque villages. Pack a picnic, because there
  isn’t much in the way of bars and cafes out here. But as an antidote to the
  overcrowded city, it’s unbeatable.
