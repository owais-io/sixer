  There are two kinds of Book Week parents: the ones who have been
  hand-stitching felt ears since July, and the ones rifling through their
  wardrobe and Googling “easy child book costumes that don’t look lazy” at 9pm
  the night before. I am firmly in the latter group. I adore Book Week. I really
  do. The parade, the noise, the delight on small faces as they become
  Gruffalos, Matildas and, almost always, Wally (he’s going to be impossible not
  to find). And even better, the smiling grandparents and parents, and the
  teachers who always impress in their elaborate costumes and matching
  enthusiasm. But every August, this celebration of reading collides head-on
  with my complete lack of crafting skills. I can plot a novel, sure. Sew a
  dragon tail? Not so much. My approach is pure survival parenting. A Hogwarts
  robe from Christmas repurposed for the third year in a row? Done. A Wimpy Kid
  mask drawn in five minutes with a black texta and stapled to some string?
  Absolutely. My kids have learned their mother’s talents lie in storytelling
  and finding things in the back of the cupboard, not in sewing sequins until
  midnight. The reality is the Book Week mental load falls mostly on mothers,
  stacked on top of everything else: school lunches, work deadlines, permission
  slips, the sudden demand for cupcakes “by tomorrow”. It’s one more task in the
  long invisible list. The thing is – and I’ve had to remind myself of this more
  than once – no one really cares how well or not your child is dressed. In this
  case at least, parents need to give themselves an A for effort. If you tried,
  you succeeded. Last year I sent my son dressed as a comic book character (OK
  fine, a gaming character whose name rhymes with Dario) because he wore the
  same costume the Halloween before. Beside him his best friend was dressed, I
  assume, as a rock star – wearing a bad wig and a T-shirt with jeans. Neither
  of them seemed to care that they weren’t technically “Book Week” characters,
  because they were swept up in the magic of the spectacle. We’re not here to
  celebrate how good you are at crafting a costume and whether it meets
  stringent Book Week standards, I say to myself. We’re here to celebrate
  reading. There’s a decline in reading for pleasure among kids as they get
  older. A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found not only are
  children reading less across the board since 2017-2018, but while 76% of
  children aged between five and eight read for pleasure, just 63% of those aged
  12 to 14 did. Reading rates continue to drop as teens get older, with almost
  30% of teens in years 7 to 12 not reading in their spare time. And we need
  more kids to read. I’m saying this not just as an author and a parent, but
  because research shows us kids who read do better from a social and economic
  perspective. The Book Week parade is a reminder of the importance of books and
  reading. Kids step into a character and for a day inhabit someone else’s life.
  They get to try on bravery, mischief, kindness. And as parents, whether we
  craft for months or wing it the night before, we get to stand in the crowd and
  watch them claim that space. But more importantly, when kids and parents go
  home, I hope the magic of books and reading continues, because having parents
  who read strongly determines whether their kids will read too. In a world
  where attention spans are shrinking and literacy rates are falling, reading is
  perhaps more important for kids than ever before. This year is the 80th
  anniversary of Children’s Book Week in Australia. I think this means it’s not
  going anywhere any time soon. I hope the joy of reading and books continues to
  be celebrated well into the future, so my own children are grappling with what
  to dress their kids for the parade – because despite my lack of crafting
  skills I do enjoy this joyous, raucous event. I know, watching my older kids
  grow up, that the costumes will be discarded and forgotten, but the memory,
  and the story, will live on. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have urgent business
  with the dress-up box. • Saman Shad is an author of two books and a mum of
