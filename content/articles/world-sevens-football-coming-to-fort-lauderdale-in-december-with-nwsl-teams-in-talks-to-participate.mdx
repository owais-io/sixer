  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has been chosen to host the next edition of World
  Sevens Football from 5-7 December this year, after the new, lucrative women’s
  football competition’s debut “grand slam” event in Portugal in May. The
  seven-a-side competition was launched earlier this year, with financial
  backing from co-founder and investor Jennifer Mackesy, a minority owner of the
  NWSL club Gotham FC, offering a $5m prize pool per tournament – one of the
  largest prize funds in global women’s sport. Beyond Bancard Field on the
  campus of Nova Southeastern University, and the home stadium of the USL Super
  League’s Fort Lauderdale United FC, will host the event. The inaugural
  eight-team tournament held in Portugal was won by Bayern Munich, who took home
  the winning prize of $2.5m after beating Manchester United in the final in
  Estoril. The clubs involved in December’s event are yet to be confirmed, but
  the Guardian understands that all eight participating teams are likely to be
  from across the Americas, with teams from Brazil, Mexico and the United States
  (including NWSL teams) among those in talks to take part. The matches are
  played using a half-size pitch and seven-a-side goals, with rolling
  substitutions permitted and 15-minute halves, accompanied by background music
  throughout. However, what makes the competition particularly different to
  other small-sided football events that have grown in popularity in recent
  years is that it involves current, elite players from existing professional
  clubs, rather than retired players or celebrities. The World Cup-winning
  former United States winger Tobin Heath is the chair of the World Sevens
  Football’s player advisory council, a group of former international stars who
  have been influential to the event’s format, structure and player facilities.
  Ajax from the Netherlands, the Portuguese club Benfica, the French giants
  Paris Saint-Germain, AS Roma of Italy, FC Rosengård of Sweden and the English
  WSL side Manchester City joined Manchester United and Bayern Munich in the
  inaugural event, which occurred during the run-up to this year’s Women’s
  Champions League, and was staged nearby in Lisbon from a Wednesday until a
  Friday. December’s event in Florida will take place across a weekend, starting
  with group games on Friday 5 December and concluding with a final two days
  later. It will come two weeks after the 2025 NWSL Championship final.
