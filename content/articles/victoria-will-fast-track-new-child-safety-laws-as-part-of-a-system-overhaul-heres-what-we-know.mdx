  Authorities in Victoria will have the power to immediately suspend an
  individual’s working with children check during an investigation, under new
  laws to be fast-tracked through the parliament this week. The premier, Jacinta
  Allan, said the laws, to be introduced to parliament on Tuesday, were just one
  part of an “overhaul” of the child safety system in the state, after a review
  by the former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill and the senior bureacrat
  Pamela White. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The government ordered the
  review after it was revealed in July that a childcare worker in Victoria had
  been charged with sexually abusing eight children aged between five months and
  two years. It is alleged that the worker held a valid working with children
  check (WCCC) at the time of his arrest in May, despite his employment being
  terminated by several centres. Here’s what we know so far about the changes.
  What is a WWCC and why does it need changing? A WWCC is a background check
  conducted by the government that screens individuals before they are able to
  work with or care for children. There were about 350,000 in place in Victoria
  alone in 2023-34. While every Australian jurisdiction has a WWCC scheme, the
  Weatherill and White review, released on Wednesday, described Victoria’s as
  the most “rigid” in the country. This is because in Victoria, a WWCC can only
  be refused if an individual is charged with, convicted of, or found guilty of
  a serious offence or if a disciplinary or regulatory finding is made against
  them. These are also the only grounds that can trigger a reassessment or
  interim suspension of a WWCC in the state. The review said this
  “over-reliance” on “above the line information” meant “red flags” could be
  missed and “an incomplete picture of risk” about an individual formed. It also
  said the state’s laws only allowed immediate suspension of a person’s WWCC in
  “limited circumstances involving very serious offending”, unlike in New South
  Wales where an interim ban is able to take effect immediately where there is
  “a real and appreciable risk of harm to children” pending a reassessment or
  the completion of an investigation. Is this the first time we are hearing
  about this problem? No. In 2015, the royal commission into child abuse
  delivered a specific report on working with children checks and urged shifting
  to a national system. Then, in 2022, the Victorian ombudsman recommended the
  state urgently change its laws after a youth worker was cleared to work with
  children despite facing sexual offence allegations, including rape, in NSW. At
  the time, Deborah Glass raised the same concerns that “the powers of
  Victoria’s screening authority are among the most limited in Australia”.
  What’s changing? Under the worker screening amendment (strengthening the
  working with children check) bill, authorities will have the power to
  immediately suspend a WWCC while it is under reassessment for intended
  revocation, with no exceptions. The attorney general, Sonya Kilkenny, said 173
  WWCCs would be immediately suspended as a result. “We will be able to move
  immediately to address some of those recent matters that have been raised in
  the media,” she said, adding: “Once this bill passes this week, the regulator
  will be able to move immediately to suspend those people until the
  re-assessment has taken place.” Allan said the changes addressed situations
  where there were “allegations that have been made [and] credible information
  that is provided about the suitability of individuals”. The laws will also
  allow a WWCC to be cancelled if it was obtained “using false or misleading
  information”, or if the individual was prohibited from applying for a
  clearance, which Kilkenny said would “protect children from those who try to
  deceive the system”. The time limits for laying charges where false
  information has been provided to obtain a WWCC clearance will increase from 12
  months to five years and six months. Kilkenny said the legislation would also
  implement a mutual recognition agreement – made at a meeting of national,
  state and territory attorneys general this month – that those working with
  children who were “banned in one” jurisdiction were “banned in all”. What
  about unsubstantiated allegations? The changes to WWCC recommended by
  Weatherill and White go much further than those recommended by Glass back in
  2022. They include mandatory online child safety training and testing to
  obtain a WWCC, not dissimilar in format to the training required when applying
  for a responsible service of alcohol certificate, and an internal review
  process for WWCC decisions, removing the option to challenge decisions at the
  Victorian civil and administrative tribunal. The most significant, though, is
  allowing unsubstantiated allegations to be considered when granting a WWCC.
  The government has committed $42m to implement all 22 recommendations by the
  end of the year. Will it pass and when? Kilkenny said this first bill would be
  fast-tracked through parliament this week, which could mean some late-night
  sittings. At shadow cabinet on Monday, the Coalition opposition agreed that it
  would not stand in the way of the bill’s passage, though it would probably try
  to move some amendments. The Greens are also expected to support it. What has
  been the federal response? Eleven of the review’s recommendations were
  directed at the commonwealth government, so there have also been changes at
  the national level. After a meeting of education ministers on Friday, the
  federal minister, Jason Clare, announced plans to introduce a national
  educator register, so authorities can know who has worked where and when, and
  a trial of CCTV in up to 300 centres nationally. Both were recommendations of
  the Weatherill and White review. Clare also committed to placing the best
  interests and the safety of children as a primary consideration in national
  law – the first recommendation of the review and a key request of Victoria’s
  minister for children, Lizzie Blandthorn, at the meeting. “Notwithstanding how
  complicated and frustrating the national law process of reform can at times
  be, everybody at that table agreed with Victoria that it was time that the
  best interests of the children – from the service to the boardroom – came
  first,” Blandthorn said on Tuesday. She said 10 of the review’s
  recommendations had been “addressed in part or in full” at the meeting.
