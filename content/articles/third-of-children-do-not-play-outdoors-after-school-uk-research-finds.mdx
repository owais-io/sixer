  One in three children do not play outdoors after school and a fifth do not at
  the weekend, according to research that found outdoor play has a beneficial
  impact on young people’s developing social and emotional skills. The
  University of Exeter study looked at data from 2,500 children between sevenand
  12 from the multiethnic Born in Bradford research programme, which tracks the
  health, development and wellbeing of mothers and children from pregnancy
  onwards. Based on information from questionnaires completed by the children’s
  parents, researchers measured the social-emotional skills of the children
  using the “total difficulties score”, a screening tool that can help identify
  potential behavioural or emotional issues in children and young people.
  Researchers found outdoor play had a positive effect on children’s
  social-emotional skills, meaning they were better able to understand, manage
  and express their emotions and behaviours, as well as interact with the world
  around them and build relationships. The study, funded by the Medical Research
  Council and due to be published in the Wellbeing, Space &amp; Society journal,
  also uncovered different patterns of outdoor play based on ethnicity. Children
  of white British heritage played outside more on school days while those of
  south Asian heritage played outside more on weekends. The findings also
  suggest children living in less deprived communities benefit more from outdoor
  play than those in more deprived communities, perhaps reflecting the quality
  of outdoor spaces and play provision. The lead researcher Dr Mark Ferguson
  said: “There’s established evidence showing outdoor play has declined by a
  lot, which is worrying because it is linked to various health issues,
  including obesity, anxiety and depression. “We need to take proactive steps to
  encourage outdoor activities and ensure children lead healthy and active
  lives. Simple measures such as creating play-friendly residential areas and
  safer urban environments where families can relax, exercise, socialise and
  play can make a big difference. But it’s important to remember cultural
  differences and engage with communities to make these initiatives successful.”
  Prof Rosie McEachan, the director of the Born in Bradford programme, said:
  “This study shows how important it is for children’s mental health to get off
  their screens and play outdoors after school and at weekends. “We are lucky in
  Bradford to have many beautiful parks and green spaces, but these findings
  show that the local streets in which we live are just as important a space for
  children, and we need to make sure they are safe and welcoming spaces, free
  from traffic and pollution.” The former children’s commissioner Anne
  Longfield, now executive chair of the Centre for Young Lives, called on the
  government to establish a new national play strategy. She said: “Play is one
  of the most powerful tools to boost children’s social skills, physical
  activity, wellbeing and confidence. Yet too many of our children are spending
  their most precious years sedentary, on their phones and often alone, while
  their health and wellbeing deteriorates. “We have to break down the barriers
  that are preventing so many of our children from playing – as part of their
  education in school, in their local parks and in neighbourhoods where they
  live. Play must become part of childhood again.” Earlier this year, a report
  by the Raising the Nation Play Commission concluded that a failure to provide
  children with the spaces they need outside the home, due to traffic-dominated
  streets, loss of funding for playgrounds and the decline in youth clubs, was
  leading to a huge loss of outdoor play and independence. Last year, the
  Guardian reported that shrinking outside space at schools and less time in the
  day for play were having a damaging impact on children’s wellbeing and
  physical health. A government spokesperson said £100m was being invested in
  sports facilities in schools and communities, while the National Education
  Nature Park scheme was helping schools transform their grounds into greener
  spaces. “We recognise the vital importance of play and access to nature, as we
  work to fulfil our mission to create the healthiest and happiest generation of
  children,” the spokesperson said.
