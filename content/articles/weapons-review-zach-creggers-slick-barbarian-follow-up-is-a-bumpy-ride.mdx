  No one really saw Barbarian coming, the playful 2022 horror about an Airbnb
  reservation gone horribly wrong. That was part of the plan, a teasing trailer
  that only told a small part of the story and a swaggering title that promised
  something grander than we could initially see, and that might be why I found
  the reaction to be a little alienating. It was showered with euphoric praise
  upon release and first-time writer-director Zach Cregger, whose background is
  in comedy, was immediately heralded as a new king of the genre. For me, it was
  more trick than treat, a sizzle reel that showed Cregger to be a film-maker of
  considerable skill but also one who papered over the cracks of an
  exasperatingly illogical and uninspired script with flashy gimmickry. There’s
  been an inevitable shift in the hype machine for Cregger’s follow-up, the
  bigger, bolder and, thankfully, better Weapons, buzz that began when his spec
  script caused a talk-of-the-town auction months after Barbarian overperformed.
  Industry rumours suggested that Jordan Peele was so determined to land the
  project that when his company lost out to New Line, he parted ways with his
  management. There’s since been over two years of anticipation – Cregger
  comparing the project to Magnolia, stars such as Julia Garner and Josh Brolin
  signing up, an all-out assault of a marketing campaign – and so second time
  around, it’s virtually impossible not to see this one coming. Credit to the
  Warner Bros marketing team for still holding something back though, the
  jolting string of trailers highlighting enough of the standard WTF imagery
  without really revealing all that much beyond the striking premise. Seventeen
  children from the same class are missing. They all got out of bed at 2.17am
  and ran off into the darkness. The police are baffled and the parents are
  furious, aiming their anger at teacher Ms Grady (Julia Garner). She’s one of
  many alternating viewpoints, which also include a parent (Josh Brolin), a cop
  (Alden Ehrenreich), a small-time criminal (Austin Abrams) and the one kid who
  didn’t run away (Cary Christopher), slowly building a picture of what really
  happened that night. It’s a tantalising set-up, pitched somewhere between
  Stephen King and the Brothers Grimm, and Cregger’s careful slow build keeps us
  in thrall for the most part, eager to see just how the puzzle-pieces fit. The
  POV-shifting allows for his excellent cast to each get their moment, from
  Garner’s nervy, vodka-swilling hate figure to Ehrenreich’s quick-tempered
  philanderer, although Cregger’s characters are all rather thinly drawn,
  resembling less the protagonists of thoughtful short stories and more the
  bodies one inhabits in a video game. They are in service of a magnetic
  drip-feed mystery plot that unravels so compellingly that it takes us a while
  to notice how empty it all is. On the one hand, it’s a relief that unlike so
  many of his genre peers, Cregger isn’t all that interested in the dirge of
  trauma horror and while those who wish to look for it might still find a
  deeper allegorical read of Weapons (probably the same few who laughably
  claimed Barbarian was a powerful #MeToo statement), it’s mostly an engine of
  brute force, similar to a schlocky paperback you can’t put down on holiday.
  But it’s also crucially lacking something, an added element of surprise or
  sophistication. It reminded me of Denis Villeneuve’s lurid missing children
  thriller Prisoners and while it’s mercifully not as undeservingly
  self-serious, it’s similarly handsome, high-end packaging for something that’s
  incredibly silly and straightforward. The tricksy structure and repetition of
  scenes from different viewpoints would have one believe there’s a labyrinthine
  plot to be uncovered but Weapons is far hokier and, frustratingly, dumber than
  it would seem, relying on staggeringly incompetent police and wilfully
  ignorant citizens. Cregger remains a remarkably confident and alluringly
  immersive director, constructing some wonderfully rattling shocks and moments
  of seat-clenching unsureness. His canny mood-conjuring grips us in the moment
  (the film is a fun, reactive experience with a big audience) and he draws a
  fantastically scary and nightmarishly odd performance from a late-arriving
  actor whose name would be a spoiler to reveal but his storytelling crumbles
  even before the lights come up. The finale might up the violence to a
  wince-inducing level but it doesn’t cut anywhere near as deep as it could
  have, chaos without meaning. It has the swagger of a sprawling crime epic but
  also, by the end, the loopy “and then” storytelling of a schoolchild. Cregger
  might be expanding and improving his arsenal, using his skills more
  effectively than he did in Barbarian, but there’s still something missing.
  Something sharper. Weapons is out in Australia on 7 August and the UK and US
  on 8 August
