  That’s all the live coverage for the day, thanks for following along. Some key
  links and developments from our reporting today: Trump said he will meet with
  Putin in Alaska next week to discuss the war in Ukraine. The Polish prime
  minister said a “freeze” in the war on Ukraine might be close after speaking
  with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As JD Vance arrived in England for his summer
  holiday, the vice-president suggested the US and UK have “disagreements” on
  Gaza including over whether to recognize a Palestinian state. The Republican
  attorney general of Texas on Friday asked the state supreme court to vacate
  the seats of 13 Democratic legislators who have left the state to stop a vote
  on a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump. The Trump administration is
  seeking a $1bn settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a
  White House official said on Friday. Trump removed Billy Long as the
  commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service two months after he was sworn in.
  The Department of Justice has reportedly issued two subpoenas to Letitia
  James, the New York attorney general who has been repeatedly criticized by
  Donald Trump. An appeals court on Friday tossed out a judge’s finding of
  contempt against the Trump administration in a case over the notorious
  deportations of Venezuelans from the US to an El Salvador prison without due
  process. Preet Bharara, the former US attorney, said in a statement he was
  representing US senator Adam Schiff, following reports that the Department of
  Justice had appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the Democrat from
  California. Ed Martin, a rightwing activist who served as interim US attorney
  for Washington DC, was tapped by attorney general Pam Bondi for the job,
  according to NBC News. Donald Trump has previously accused Schiff of mortgage
  fraud, a claim that the senator has forcefully denied. In a July video
  responding to the claims, Schiff said: “The basis of his accusation is that I
  own a home in Maryland, and I own my home in California. Big surprise –
  members of Congress, almost all of them, own more than one home or rent more
  than one home because we’re required to be on both coasts … Donald Trump [is]
  trying to bring about political retribution, retaliation.” In a statement
  published by a Politico reporter this evening, Bharara said, “The allegations
  against Senator Schiff are transparently false, state, and long debunked.”
  Bharara said the “bias” of Martin’s appointment was “glaring”, giving that
  Schiff had placed a hold on his nomination to be US attorney: “Any supposed
  investigation led by him would be the very definition of weaponization of the
  justice process.” Martin has defended January 6 rioters, and his US attorney
  nomination ultimately failed. On Friday, the Democratic leaders of the
  California state legislature said they were prepared to move forward with a
  ballot measure asking voters to redraw the state’s house map should Texas
  follow through with its proposed redistricting plan. “We don’t move unless
  they move,” California governor Gavin Newsom said during a news conference in
  Sacramento, where he was joined by a delegation of Democratic state
  representatives from Texas. “But we’re not going to unilaterally disarm.” US
  congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said every Democratic member of the state’s
  congressional delegation supported the California ballot initiative. “We
  cannot stand here and just shrug as Trump and the Republicans try and rig the
  rules so they can avoid responsibility for the damage that they have done to
  this country,” she said. “We need a break on them, and we can get it in the
  midterm elections.” A Texas judge has ruled that Beto O’Rourke, the former
  congressman, cannot provide financial assistance to the state Democratic
  lawmakers who have left the state to block Republicans’ gerrymandering, the
  Texas Tribune reports. O’Rourke, a former presidential candidate, was sued by
  the state’s GOP attorney general, Ken Paxton, who claimed the Democrat and his
  group, Powered by People, were unlawfully helping the Democratic lawmakers and
  engaged in deceptive fundraising. Paxton has been pursuing an array of
  aggressive tactics to punish the legislators who are breaking quorum in an
  effort to stop Republicans from redrawing the congressional map. The Tarrant
  county district judge, Megan Fahey, issued an injunction against O’Rourke less
  than four hours after Paxton filed his claim, according to the Tribune, which
  noted that Fahey was appointed by GOP governor Greg Abbott in 2019. O’Rourke
  earlier filed a separate lawsuit against Paxton to try to block his attacks on
  his group. The Democrat condemned the attorney general and the injunction in a
  social media post this evening, writing: They want to make examples out of
  those who fight so that others won’t. Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by
  People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country,
  because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections… the kind of
  work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump and Abbott have on power in
  Texas. Paxton said in a statement: “The Beto Bribe buyouts that were
  bankrolling the runaway Democrats have been officially stopped.” Vladimir
  Putin’s trip to Alaska next week to meet with Donald Trump will be the first
  time the Russian president has been to the US in a decade, the Associated
  Press notes. His last US visit was a meeting with Barack Obama for the UN
  general assembly in New York in September 2015, which was his seventh visit to
  the US as Russia’s leader. He first met with Bill Clinton at a UN event in
  2000. Trump announced this evening on his social media site that the meeting
  would take place in Alaska next Friday, 15 August. The two are slated to
  discuss an end to the three-and-a-half-year war, which Trump said Friday would
  have to involve “some swapping of territories”. As we reported earlier this
  week, finding a neutral venue to host the summit would have been difficult,
  given that the Russian president was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the
  international criminal court, and so is subject to arrest in 125 countries.
  Several protesters outside New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza government
  building were arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct, with demonstrators
  accusing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency of operating
  a covert detention facility there, according to several reports. Protesters
  marched to the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Friday
  morning and chanted outside the building. Demonstrators demanded access to the
  site, which was denied, and they later held a sit-in outside the courthouse,
  according to ABC7. Within a few minutes the New York City police department
  moved in to arrest some of the protesters for disorderly conduct, according to
  reports, as activists could be seen blocking the street. Trump’s announcement
  that he will be meeting Putin next week in Alaska comes after the US president
  suggested at a briefing that an end to the Ukraine invasion might involve
  “swapping of territories”. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Putin
  has presented the Trump administration with a proposal for a ceasefire in
  Ukraine if Kyiv makes major territorial concessions. The newspaper’s report,
  citing European and Ukrainian officials, said the proposal would require
  Ukraine hand over the Donbas in the east of the country, which has led
  European officials to express serious reservations. Bloomberg, meanwhile,
  reported that the deal could cement some of Putin’s territorial gains in
  Ukraine, effectively freezing the battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia
  regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, although
  much of their territory remains under Ukrainian control, as the Guardian
  reported Friday. The last US-Russia summit was in 2021, when Joe Biden met
  Putin in Geneva. Zelenskyy has been speaking with European leaders including
  the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel
  Macron. More details here: Donald Trump said he plans to meet Vladimir Putin
  in Alaska next Friday, 15 August. He announced the location in a brief post on
  his social media site early this evening. Our recent reporting on the latest
  developments: California Democratic legislators are holding an afternoon
  briefing about their proposal to counter Republican’s gerrymandering in Texas
  with a ballot measure. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said all members of the
  California delegation supported a plan to redraw the state’s districts to
  eliminate five Republican seats – if Texas moves forward with its
  gerrymandering plan that would add five GOP seats. “When we saw that Texas was
  going to create the most segregated map in Texas since the 60s, to eliminate
  all of the minority districts that they could, so that they could create five
  Republican districts, we said, could we create a map that eliminated five
  Republican districts, but that was true to the Voting Rights Act? And we found
  that we could,” Lofgren said. Governor Gavin Newsom has floated a statewide
  ballot measure that would allow voters to weigh the proposal to adjust the
  state’s congressional map if the Texas GOP executes its plan. Robert Rivas,
  the Democratic speaker of the California state assembly, said, “We will fight
  fire with fire. And we will do whatever it takes to defend our democracy.”
  California is hosting Texas Democratic lawmakers who have left the state to
  break quorum and block gerrymandering. The Texas Democratic party chairman has
  responded to the lawsuit filed by Ken Paxton, the state’s Republican attorney
  general, seeking to remove 13 Democratic lawmakers from office, saying in a
  statement: Texas Democrats are exercising a long-standing, constitutionally
  protected right of the minority party to block extreme agendas – in this case,
  gerrymandering to keep Trump in power. These lawmakers have taken significant
  risks and sacrifices to stop Trump’s agenda, and despite all the threats they
  face, they remain undeterred, just like the rest of us. If Ken Paxton wants a
  fight, we will give him one.” Paxton has sought to enforce arrest warrants
  against the Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to stop Republicans from
  gerrymandering the congressional map in a manner that would add five more GOP
  seats. Some more background on what happened at the Texas house today: Billy
  Long, who is stepping down as the Internal Revenue Service commissioner only
  two months after he was appointed, has said he will be serving as ambassador
  to Iceland. The New York Times reported earlier today that Trump had Long
  removed, and that Long had clashed with Scott Bessent, treasury secretary, who
  will now serve as acting commissioner. Long is a former congressman from
  Missouri and close ally to the president who previously pushed false claims
  that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. The IRS has been run by six
  different people this year so far. Vladimir Putin has presented the Trump
  administration with a proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine if Kyiv makes major
  territorial concessions, according to a new Wall Street Journal report that
  cites European and Ukrainian officials. The proposal would require Ukraine
  that hand over the Donbas in the east of the country, which has led European
  officials to express serious reservations, the Journal reported. “European and
  Ukrainian officials, who were briefed by President Trump and Witkoff in a
  series of calls this week, said they worry Putin is simply using the offer as
  a ploy to avoid punishing new US sanctions and tariffs while continuing the
  war,” the Journal reported. The report was published as Trump, in a briefing
  with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, suggested there would “be some
  swapping of territories” to end the Ukraine invasion. The president spent a
  significant portion of the event discussing Russia, suggesting he would have
  more to announce soon and that he and Putin would be meeting “very shortly”.
  Trump has said he will soon have an update on Russia and would be meeting with
  Putin “very shortly”. Today was the original deadline he had set to end the
  Ukraine invasion or bring new sanctions. At the event with the leaders of
  Armenia and Azerbaijan, the president made vague remarks about next steps,
  saying: President Putin I believe wants to see peace, and Zelenskyy wants to
  see peace. Now, President Zelenskyy has to get … everything he needs, because
  he’s going to have to get ready to sign something, and I think he is working
  hard to get that done. Asked if Zelenskyy would have to give up territory, the
  president responded: “You’re looking at territory that’s been fought over for
  three and a half years. A lot of Russians have died. A lot of Ukrainians have
  died. So we’re looking at that, but we’re actually looking to get some back
  and some swapping. It’s complicated.” Trump has said he would also soon
  announce details on the location of a meeting. The US president and the
  leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have officially signed the peace agreement,
  establishing a so-called “Trump route for international peace and prosperity”.
  The corridor for transit and trade will connect mainland Azerbaijan with the
  autonomous Nakhchivan region, and the AP reported that the Trump
  administration said it was the Armenians who suggested naming it after the US
  president. Both leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan heaped praise on Trump and
  suggested he should receive a Nobel peace prize, which Trump has expressed
  interest in winning. In the state dining room, Donald Trump is flanked by the
  president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, to his right, and the Armenian prime
  minister, Nikol Pashinyan, on his left. Trump says that both nations agree to
  “stop all fighting forever”. But a key part of the agreement is that it
  establishes what will be now known as “the Trump route for international peace
  and prosperity”. This is a key transit corridor that will have US development
  rights. Trump adds that he thinks Aliyev and Pashinyan are “going to have a
  great relationship”. The Texas House failed to meet quorum for a third time
  today, after only 95 of the 100 representatives needed were present. Dozens of
  Democratic lawmakers continue to defy Governor Greg Abbott’s demands to
  return, and remain out of state in protest over a new GOP-drawn congressional
  map. The Democrats’ next stop on their tour to deny quorum is California.
  They’ll hold a press conference at 5pm ET today with Governor Gavin Newsom in
  Sacramento. Abbott has spent the last 24 hours ratcheting up and repeating
  threats against the absent Democrats. He vowed to “call special session, after
  special session, after special session with the same agenda items on there”,
  in an interview with NBC News. Meanwhile, the Trump administration wasted no
  time today. A few standout items are below. First, the DoJ has issued two
  grand jury subpoenas to the New York attorney general, Letitia James, also a
  longtime Trump adversary, according to various reports. One of the subpoenas
  is tied to a civil fraud case her office brought against Trump, and the other
  is reportedly tied to the attorney general’s investigation into NRA. The Trump
  administration is also demanding that UCLA pay the federal government $1bn
  over multiple instalments to settle claims of antisemitism. That’s according
  to a report from CNN. If the proposal is agreed to, it would mark the biggest
  settlement the government has received from a higher education institution.
  And then, according to new reporting by the New York Times, the president has
  secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force
  against certain Latin American drug cartels that the Trump administration
  considers terrorist organizations. In response Mexico’s president, Claudia
  Sheinbaum, said her government had been informed of a coming order but that it
  had nothing to do with the US military operating on Mexican soil. Finally, for
  now at least, the Trump administration was handed a win when it comes to its
  ongoing showdown with the judiciary over the president’s immigration agenda. A
  federal appeals court overturned Judge James Boasberg’s ruling that found
  probable cause to hold Trump administration officials in contempt of court
  over their handling of the deportations of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants
  under the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act. The New York Times is reporting
  that Donald Trump is replacing the IRS commissioner, Billy Long, only two
  months after her was confirmed. Long is a former congressman from Missouri and
  a notable Trump ally – who pushed false claims that the 2020 election was
  stolen. According to the Times, Long is being primed for an ambassador
  nomination. It is unclear who lead the agency next, according to the Times.
  Long is the sixth person to run the IRS this year alone, there have been four
  acting commissioners since Danny Werfel’s resignation in January, following
  Trump’s inauguration. A senior administration official tells the Times that
  treasury secretary Scott Bessent will be named acting commissioner. We’ll be
  bringing you the latest as Donald Trump prepares to welcome the Armenian prime
  minister, Nikol Pashinyan, followed by the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham
  Aliyev. They’re expected to sign a peace deal, which would be a landmark
  development in decades of tension and fighting. Pashinyan is due to arrive
  soon. The meeting will be certainly be an opportunity for the president to
  highlight his “peacemaker-in-chief” bona fides, but peace is more elusive in
  one of the hallmark international conflicts of Trump’s second term. Today is
  Trump’s original deadline for Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine, or face
  fresh sanctions. So far there’s been no update, but Trump has said he is ready
  to meet with Vladimir Putin despite the Russian leader’s refusal to sit-down
  with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The exact time and location remain
  undefined, but the UAE has been floated, given Putin’s refusal to talk in
  Kyiv. The Trump administration is demanding that the University of California,
  Los Angeles, pay the federal government $1bn over multiple installments to
  settle claims of antisemitism, according to a report from CNN. The settlement
  would also require UCLA to pay $172m to a fund for Jewish students and other
  individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights
  Act, per CNN. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis race,
  color, religion, sex and national origin. CNN notes that if the proposal is
  agreed to, it would mark the biggest settlement the government has received
  from a higher education institution. CNN has not yet received comment from the
  University of California system. According to CNN’s reporting, “the proposed
  agreement prohibits overnight demonstrations and calls on the school to revise
  its policies and procedures on protests. It also requires UCLA to discontinue
  race and ethnicity-based scholarships and provide the resolution monitor with
  admissions data.” Burrows is now speaking and says that he and attorney
  general Ken Paxton have tried to make the civil arrest warrants they have
  filed against Democratic lawmakers “enforceable beyond state lines”. Also,
  notably, Burrows is enacting a new policy that states that any member breaking
  quorum will no longer have their paycheck or per diem deposited
  electronically. While the Capitol is not withholding pay – as that violates
  the state’s constitution – they are now stipulating that their paychecks must
  now be picked up in person. Burrows said the statehouse will withhold a
  percentage of absent Democrats’ monthly expenses, and any administrative work
  that requires the House’s approval will need to be done in person. The Texas
  legislature failed to meet quorum for a third time today, after only 95 of the
  100 representatives needed were present. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers defied
  Governor Greg Abbott’s demands to return, and remain out of state in protest
  over a new GOP-drawn congressional map. Speaker Dustin Burrows attempted to
  reconvene the house today and meet quorum after it failed earlier this week.
  In an interview with Ruthless Podcast, Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott,
  threatened to add “six, or seven or eight” new seats to the GOP-drawn
  congressional map that Democrats are already protesting by breaking quorum.
  The current proposal is a gerrymandered map that could secure Republicans five
  seats in Texas ahead of the 2026 midterms. When asked about how he sees this
  redistricting battle ending, Abbott was resolute: “One way or the other, they
  [Democrats] are coming back, and it’s going to end with these maps being
  passed.” The DOJ has issued two grand jury subpoenas to Letitia James, the New
  York attorney general and longtime Trump adversary, according to reports. One
  of the cases relates to a civil fraud case brought by James’s office against
  Trump, which resulted in the president owing New York state $500m, the New
  York Times reported. The other case relates to the attorney general’s
  investigation into National Rifle Association (NRA), a rightwing gun lobbying
  group. The investigation will raise further concerns that Trump is using the
  legal system to pursue personal vendettas. Last month the justice department
  announced a new “strike force” to investigate unsubstantiated charges that
  Barack Obama and top officials conspired to hurt Trump’s 2016 campaign, as
  legal experts told the Guardian that the department is “being used as a
  personal weapon” by Trump. “Any weaponization of the justice system should
  disturb every American. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation
  against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will
  continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights,” James’s office said in a
  statement. Today, the hotel where several Texas Democrats are staying
  experienced a second bomb threat in one week, according to local police. The
  St Charles police department said that they conducted a thorough search of the
  area, and no explosive device was found. They confirmed that all 70 hotel
  guests are safe. Today’s bomb threat comes just days after an initial bomb
  threat at the same hotel, which is located in a suburb outside Chicago. It’s
  not immediately clear how many Texas lawmakers are still staying at the
  Q-Center hotel where the threats were made. In an interview with NBC News,
  Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, said he would call “special session, after
  special session, after special session with the same agenda items on there”,
  referring to the Democratic lawmakers who broke quorum this week. The
  legislators have vowed to stay out of Texas until at least the end of the
  current session, which ends on 19 August. In the interview, Abbott, a
  Republican, was undeterred. “Democrats act like they’re not going to come back
  as long as this is an issue,” Abbott said. “That means they’re not going to
  come back until like 2027 or 2028.” Since the quorum break, the legislative
  business of the entire session is now on ice. This includes relief for the
  victims of the catastrophic flooding that hit Texas last month. “There’s only
  one thing that’s denying our ability to get legislation passed. And it’s these
  Democrats who have fled the state, turned their backs on their fellow
  constituents,” Abbott said. “And those Democrats are going to lose their job
  in the upcoming election, if they don’t get kicked out before then, because
  they’re not stepping up helping out their constituents who are in desperate
  need.” It’s important to note that Republican House leadership in Texas chose
  to start the special session with the question of redistricting legislation.
  The Texas legislature is hoping to resume its special session today at 2pm ET,
  after Democratic lawmakers broke quorum for two consecutive days earlier this
  week in protest over a gerrymandered congressional map, drawn by the state’s
  GOP. For their part, the dozens of absent Democrats have hunkered down in blue
  states – such as Illinois, New York and Massachusetts – and have told the
  Guardian they plan to stay away from the Texas Capitol for “as long as it
  takes”. The Democrats’ next stop on their tour to deny quorum is California.
  Where they’ll hold a press conference at 5pm ET today with Governor Gavin
  Newsom and House speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott,
  and attorney general, Ken Paxton, both Republicans, have threatened the
  legislators who left town with civil arrest warrants. Paxton has also promised
  to file court orders that would declare the Democrats’ seats vacant if they
  fail to return to Texas by Friday. Meanwhile, Texas senator John Cornyn, also
  a Republican, has said the FBI has agreed to help local law enforcement locate
  and arrest the legislators, despite none of them being been charged with a
  crime. For his part, Gavin Newsom has taken a leading role in the
  redistricting arms race that’s ensued, and pledged to retaliate against
  Republicans’ redistricting efforts by working to change California’s own
  congressional map. An advocacy group sued the US justice department and the
  FBI on Friday for records detailing their handling of the sex-trafficking
  investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The legal
  organization Democracy Forward is seeking records related to senior
  administration officials’ communications about Epstein documents and any
  regarding correspondence between Epstein and Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed
  in federal court in Washington DC, appears to be the first of its kind. The
  group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia)
  for the records related to communications about the case in late July that
  have not yet been fulfilled. “The court should intervene urgently to ensure
  the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary
  situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the
  Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal government often shields
  records related to criminal investigations from public view. The Epstein case
  has been subject to heightened public focus since the justice department said
  last month it would not release additional documents from the case. Meanwhile,
  top Trump officials reportedly met at the White House on Wednesday night to
  discuss strategy moving forward as the Trump administration continues to face
  criticism, including from Republicans, for its handling of the official files
  related to Epstein and the US president’s responses to calls for the release
  of all documents related to the criminal investigation. The meeting was
  reportedly hosted by JD Vance, with the gathering moved from the
  vice-president’s official residence to the White House, according to reporting
  by CNN. The meeting had been billed to include top Trump officials, including
  the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel. Vance
  and his staff had denied that a meeting to discuss the handling of the
  rumbling Epstein scandal was taking place. The Trump administration is now
  weighing whether to release recorded audio from the recent Department of
  Justice interview with Epstein’s convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
  Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said that members of the US
  military would not be entering Mexican territory after a news report that
  Washington may take such action to combat drug cartels. Earlier today, the New
  York Times (paywall) reported that Donald Trump had secretly signed a
  directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin
  American drug cartels. Sheinbaum said her government had been informed of a
  coming order but that it had nothing to do with the US military operating on
  Mexican soil. A US appeals court has overturned a lower court’s ruling finding
  probable cause to hold Trump administration officials in contempt of court
  over their handling of the deportations of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants
  under a centuries-old wartime law. US district judge James Boasberg found in
  April that officials could face criminal contempt charges for willfully
  disregarding his 15 March order barring the deportations to El Salvador of
  alleged Venezuelan gang members under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act without the
  chance to challenge their removals. The Trump administration appealed. This
  morning, a three-judge panel of the DC circuit US court of appeals sided with
  the government by a 2-1 vote. Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both of
  whom were nominated by Donald Trump in his first term in the White House,
  concurred with the unsigned majority opinion. Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was
  appointed by Barack Obama, dissented. “The District Court’s order raises
  troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like
  the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,”
  Katsas wrote in an opinion. The Washington division of the Bureau of Alcohol,
  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) posted on X today – in the early hours
  – to show their presence alongside US park police. This comes after the White
  House committed to beef up federal law enforcement to combat crime in the
  nation’s capital, despite a 30-year low in violent crime in 2024, according to
  a report by the justice department. Trump firing labor statistics head won’t
  achieve his agenda, says former chief Donald Trump will need to take more
  radical action than simply firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
  (BLS) if he is determined to “cook the books” on jobs figures, the federal
  agency’s former commissioner has said. Erica Groshen, who ran the BLS during
  Barack Obama’s presidency, said meddling with how government statisticians
  calculate unemployment and labour market trends would require “a whole new
  cadre” of people to be brought in by a new commissioner. It would also provoke
  upheaval and a likely rash of whistleblowing among the existing workforce.
  Trump provoked widespread criticism last week by firing the BLS’s
  commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after weaker-than-expected jobs numbers for
  July and downward revisions for the two previous months, statistics that
  seemed to portend a looming economic slowdown. In an interview, Groshen said
  Trump’s reasoning for terminating McEntarfer had “no basis at all”. She said
  the decision was “very shocking” despite having warned of such a possibility
  earlier this year in a briefing paper that flagged changes in civil service
  employment classifications under Trump, which make it easer to fire senior
  officials deemed to be out of step with the president’s agenda. “This isn’t
  inconsistent with the way he’s acted in other situations,” she said. “[But]
  it’s a question of boundaries. I had quietly hoped and assumed it wouldn’t
  happen.” Read more here: We’re getting more updates from the Chevening House
  visit between JD Vance and the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy. Ahead of
  their meeting today, the US vice-president and Lammy took the opportunity to
  go carp fishing behind the estate. Alas, no fish were actually caught.
  Speaking to reporters, Lammy said that the pair will be “discussing the
  developing situation in the Middle East and in Gaza”, and Vance noted that the
  US has “no plans to recognise a Palestinian state” but “the president has been
  very moved by these terrible images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. So we
  want to make sure that we solve that problem.” As we wait for more on the
  meeting, here are a few snaps of the fruitless fishing expedition. According
  to new reporting by the New York Times, the president has secretly signed a
  directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin
  American drug cartels that the Trump administration considers terrorist
  organizations. According to the Times’ sources, US military officials have
  started drawing up options for how the military could go after the group. The
  Times also notes that this escalation would be the most “aggressive step” in
  the administration’s “campaign against cartels”. They also noted that this
  continues the president’s preference for using “military forces to carry out
  what has primarily been considered a law enforcement responsibility to curb
  the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs”. In February, the state
  department designated Tren de Aragua, MS-13 and several other organizations as
  foreign terrorist organizations. Today, a federal judge in Los Angeles will
  hear arguments in the Trump administration’s request to strike down the
  landmark Flores settlement agreement – a 1997 consent decree which provides
  basic rights and protections to child immigrants in its custody. The
  settlement also limits the length of time that Customs and Border Protection
  (CBP) can hold children in custody to 72 hours, and requires them to be housed
  in safe and sanitary conditions. The administration argues that “unlawful
  family migration barely existed 1997”. They add that the agreement has
  prevented agencies from carrying out effective immigration policy. Last year,
  the same judge presiding over today’s hearing approved the Biden
  administration’s request to partially lift oversight protections at the
  Department of Health and Human Services. The agreement is still in place at
  CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies. During Trump’s first
  term in office, the administration asked a judge to dissolve the Flores
  settlement agreement, but its motion was struck down. The president’s day
  really kicks into gear at 2.30pm ET, when he will welcome the Armenian prime
  minister, Nikol Pashinyan, to the White House, followed by the president of
  Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev. Donald Trump will hold separate meeting with the two
  leaders, and the day will culminate in a trilateral signing between the three
  nations. The president has characterised the day as a “Historic Peace Summit”
  on Truth Social, and touted his role as an international peacemaker. “Many
  Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to
  ‘TRUMP’,” he said in his post. We’ve already seen some reaction to Donald
  Trump’s nomination of Stephen Miran – currently the chair of the Council of
  Economic Advisers – to fill the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve’s board of
  governors. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking member on
  the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee said in a statement
  late yesterday that Miran was “a Trump loyalist”. The Senate Banking committee
  is responsible for holding a confirmation hearing for the nominee. In her
  statement, Warren promised “tough questions” for Miran to determine “whether
  he’d serve the American people as an independent voice at the Fed or merely
  serve Donald Trump”. Donald Trump on Thursday demanded the immediate
  resignation of new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him “highly conflicted” due
  to his ties to Chinese firms and raising doubts about plans to turn around the
  struggling American chip icon. Reuters reported exclusively in April that Tan
  invested at least $200m in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip
  firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military. Trump’s comments
  came a day after Reuters was first to report that Republican Senator Tom
  Cotton had sent a letter to Intel’s board chair with questions about Tan’s
  ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case involving his former firm
  Cadence Design. “The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign,
  immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump said in a post
  on his Truth Social platform. Intel shares closed down 3% on Thursday. Donald
  Trump announced he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Friday
  for what he called a “Historic Peace Summit” aimed at ending decades of
  hostilities between the two former Soviet republics. Nikol Pashinyan,
  Armenia’s prime minister, and Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, “will
  join me at the White House for an official Peace Signing Ceremony,” Trump
  posted Thursday on his Truth Social platform. Sworn enemies for decades, the
  two went to war twice over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, which
  Azerbaijan recaptured from Armenian forces in a lightning 2023 offensive,
  sparking the exodus of more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians. The two countries
  have held talks aimed at securing a peaceful resolution, including last month
  in the United Arab Emirates, but a breakthrough had proved elusive. Donald
  Trump on Thursday said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers chairman
  Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the
  Federal Reserve while the White House seeks a permanent addition to the
  central bank’s governing board and continues its search for a new Fed chair.
  Miran, who has called for a complete overhaul of the Fed’s governance, will
  take over from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation
  last week, as she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown
  University. The term expires 31 January, 2026 and is subject to approval by
  the Senate, Reuters reported. Trump said the White House continues to search
  for someone to serve in the 14-year Fed Board seat that opens 1 February.
  Trump is also weighing options for a successor to Fed chair Jerome Powell,
  whose term ends 15 May, 2026. The Trump administration is doubling to $50m a
  reward for the arrest of Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, accusing him
  of being one of the world’s largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels
  to flood the US with fentanyl-laced cocaine. “Under president Trump’s
  leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for
  his despicable crimes,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday in a video
  announcing the reward. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2020,
  during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal
  charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. At the time, the
  US offered a $15 million reward for his arrest. That was later raised by the
  Biden administration to $25 million — the same amount the US offered for the
  capture of Osama bin Laden following the 11 September, 2001, attacks. JD Vance
  kicks off a trip in the United Kingdom with a meeting with British foreign
  secretary David Lammy on Friday that will bring renewed scrutiny of Vance’s
  sharp criticism of Britain and its governing Labour party. The US
  vice-president, his wife, Usha, and their three young children are expected to
  land in London at the start of a trip that includes staying with Lammy at
  Chevening, the country residence used by the foreign minister, Reuters
  reported. They will later stay in the Cotswolds, a picturesque area of English
  countryside and a popular retreat for wealthy and influential figures, from
  footballers and film stars to media and political figures. The visit to the
  United Kingdom comes amid heightened transatlantic tensions, domestic
  political shifts in both countries and increased attention on Vance’s foreign
  policy views as he emerges as a key figure in president Donald Trump’s
  administration. A source familiar with the planning described the trip as a
  working visit that will include several official engagements, meetings and
  visits to cultural sites. Vance is also expected to meet with US troops. Good
  morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will
  be bringing you all the latest news lines from the day. There will be
  increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington DC, the White
  House announced yesterday, to combat crime for at least the next week. It
  comes amid Donald Trump’s suggestions that his administration could fully take
  over running the city, Associated Press reports. “Washington, DC is an amazing
  city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,” White House
  press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “President Trump has
  directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent
  citizens.” She added that the increased federal presence means “there will be
  no safe harbor for violent criminals in DC”. Trump has repeatedly suggested
  that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so
  would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump
  said lawyers are examining — but could face steep push back. “We have a
  capital that’s very unsafe,” Trump told reporters at the White House this
  week. “We have to run DC.” Trump’s intervention follows an alleged attack on
  on a federal employee who worked for the so-called “department of government
  efficiency” (Doge). In other developments: Vice-president JD Vance kicks off a
  trip in the United Kingdom with a meeting with British foreign secretary David
  Lammy on Friday that will bring renewed scrutiny of Vance’s sharp criticism of
  Britain and its governing Labour party. Vance, his wife, Usha, and their three
  young children are expected to land in London at the start of a trip that
  includes staying with Lammy at Chevening, the country residence used by the
  foreign minister. The Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and state house
  speaker Dustin Burrows have filed a lawsuit in Illinois to enforce arrest
  warrants against Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block Republicans from
  enacting a gerrymandered congressional map that would likely add five more
  Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. The civil petition was
  filed in an Adams county, Illinois, circuit court, about a four and a half
  hour drive from Chicago. More than 30 Texas Democratic members are named in
  the suit. The Trump administration is doubling to $50 million a reward for the
  arrest of Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of being one of
  the world’s largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the US
  with fentanyl-laced cocaine. “Under president Trump’s leadership, Maduro will
  not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes,”
  Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday in a video announcing the reward.
  Israel’s political-security cabinet approved a plan early on Friday to take
  control of Gaza City, a move expanding military operations despite
  intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating, almost
  two-year-old war. Far-right allies in prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  coalition have been pushing for a total takeover of Gaza as part of his vow to
  eradicate Hamas militants, though the military has warned this could
  jeopardise the lives of remaining hostages. President Donald Trump on Thursday
  said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to
  serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve
  while the White House seeks a permanent addition to the central bank’s
  governing board and continues its search for a new Fed chair. Miran, who has
  called for a complete overhaul of the Fed’s governance, will take over from
  Fed Governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation last week, as
  she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University. Donald
  Trump will announce a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday 8
  August, according to reports from both Reuters and CBS News. The respective
  leaders of both Azerbaijan and Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, will
  attend events at the White House tomorrow, despite decades-long tension
  between the two countries. Donald Trump has said he was ready to meet Vladimir
  Putin despite the Russian leader’s refusal to meet Ukraine’s Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy – dispelling speculation that direct talks between the two warring
  presidents were a precondition to a high-level US-Russia summit. Speaking to
  reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said that Putin did not have
  to meet with Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet.
  Donald Trump has called on Intel’s chief executive to resign, alleging Lip-Bu
  Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock of the US
  chipmaker falling. “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign,
  immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no other
  solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”.

That’s all the live coverage for the day, thanks for following along. Some key links and developments from our reporting today: Trump said he will meet with Putin in Alaska next week to discuss the war in Ukraine. The Polish prime minister said a “freeze” in the war on Ukraine might be close after speaking with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As JD Vance arrived in England for his summer holiday, the vice-president suggested the US and UK have “disagreements” on Gaza including over whether to recognize a Palestinian state. The Republican attorney general of Texas on Friday asked the state supreme court to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic legislators who have left the state to stop a vote on a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump. The Trump administration is seeking a $1bn settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said on Friday. Trump removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service two months after he was sworn in. The Department of Justice has reportedly issued two subpoenas to Letitia James, the New York attorney general who has been repeatedly criticized by Donald Trump. An appeals court on Friday tossed out a judge’s finding of contempt against the Trump administration in a case over the notorious deportations of Venezuelans from the US to an El Salvador prison without due process. Preet Bharara, the former US attorney, said in a statement he was representing US senator Adam Schiff, following reports that the Department of Justice had appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the Democrat from California. Ed Martin, a rightwing activist who served as interim US attorney for Washington DC, was tapped by attorney general Pam Bondi for the job, according to NBC News. Donald Trump has previously accused Schiff of mortgage fraud, a claim that the senator has forcefully denied. In a July video responding to the claims, Schiff said: “The basis of his accusation is that I own a home in Maryland, and I own my home in California. Big surprise – members of Congress, almost all of them, own more than one home or rent more than one home because we’re required to be on both coasts … Donald Trump [is] trying to bring about political retribution, retaliation.” In a statement published by a Politico reporter this evening, Bharara said, “The allegations against Senator Schiff are transparently false, state, and long debunked.” Bharara said the “bias” of Martin’s appointment was “glaring”, giving that Schiff had placed a hold on his nomination to be US attorney: “Any supposed investigation led by him would be the very definition of weaponization of the justice process.” Martin has defended January 6 rioters, and his US attorney nomination ultimately failed. On Friday, the Democratic leaders of the California state legislature said they were prepared to move forward with a ballot measure asking voters to redraw the state’s house map should Texas follow through with its proposed redistricting plan. “We don’t move unless they move,” California governor Gavin Newsom said during a news conference in Sacramento, where he was joined by a delegation of Democratic state representatives from Texas. “But we’re not going to unilaterally disarm.” US congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said every Democratic member of the state’s congressional delegation supported the California ballot initiative. “We cannot stand here and just shrug as Trump and the Republicans try and rig the rules so they can avoid responsibility for the damage that they have done to this country,” she said. “We need a break on them, and we can get it in the midterm elections.” A Texas judge has ruled that Beto O’Rourke, the former congressman, cannot provide financial assistance to the state Democratic lawmakers who have left the state to block Republicans’ gerrymandering, the Texas Tribune reports. O’Rourke, a former presidential candidate, was sued by the state’s GOP attorney general, Ken Paxton, who claimed the Democrat and his group, Powered by People, were unlawfully helping the Democratic lawmakers and engaged in deceptive fundraising. Paxton has been pursuing an array of aggressive tactics to punish the legislators who are breaking quorum in an effort to stop Republicans from redrawing the congressional map. The Tarrant county district judge, Megan Fahey, issued an injunction against O’Rourke less than four hours after Paxton filed his claim, according to the Tribune, which noted that Fahey was appointed by GOP governor Greg Abbott in 2019. O’Rourke earlier filed a separate lawsuit against Paxton to try to block his attacks on his group. The Democrat condemned the attorney general and the injunction in a social media post this evening, writing: They want to make examples out of those who fight so that others won’t. Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections… the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump and Abbott have on power in Texas. Paxton said in a statement: “The Beto Bribe buyouts that were bankrolling the runaway Democrats have been officially stopped.” Vladimir Putin’s trip to Alaska next week to meet with Donald Trump will be the first time the Russian president has been to the US in a decade, the Associated Press notes. His last US visit was a meeting with Barack Obama for the UN general assembly in New York in September 2015, which was his seventh visit to the US as Russia’s leader. He first met with Bill Clinton at a UN event in 2000. Trump announced this evening on his social media site that the meeting would take place in Alaska next Friday, 15 August. The two are slated to discuss an end to the three-and-a-half-year war, which Trump said Friday would have to involve “some swapping of territories”. As we reported earlier this week, finding a neutral venue to host the summit would have been difficult, given that the Russian president was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the international criminal court, and so is subject to arrest in 125 countries. Several protesters outside New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza government building were arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct, with demonstrators accusing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency of operating a covert detention facility there, according to several reports. Protesters marched to the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Friday morning and chanted outside the building. Demonstrators demanded access to the site, which was denied, and they later held a sit-in outside the courthouse, according to ABC7. Within a few minutes the New York City police department moved in to arrest some of the protesters for disorderly conduct, according to reports, as activists could be seen blocking the street. Trump’s announcement that he will be meeting Putin next week in Alaska comes after the US president suggested at a briefing that an end to the Ukraine invasion might involve “swapping of territories”. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Putin has presented the Trump administration with a proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine if Kyiv makes major territorial concessions. The newspaper’s report, citing European and Ukrainian officials, said the proposal would require Ukraine hand over the Donbas in the east of the country, which has led European officials to express serious reservations. Bloomberg, meanwhile, reported that the deal could cement some of Putin’s territorial gains in Ukraine, effectively freezing the battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian control, as the Guardian reported Friday. The last US-Russia summit was in 2021, when Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva. Zelenskyy has been speaking with European leaders including the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. More details here: Donald Trump said he plans to meet Vladimir Putin in Alaska next Friday, 15 August. He announced the location in a brief post on his social media site early this evening. Our recent reporting on the latest developments: California Democratic legislators are holding an afternoon briefing about their proposal to counter Republican’s gerrymandering in Texas with a ballot measure. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said all members of the California delegation supported a plan to redraw the state’s districts to eliminate five Republican seats – if Texas moves forward with its gerrymandering plan that would add five GOP seats. “When we saw that Texas was going to create the most segregated map in Texas since the 60s, to eliminate all of the minority districts that they could, so that they could create five Republican districts, we said, could we create a map that eliminated five Republican districts, but that was true to the Voting Rights Act? And we found that we could,” Lofgren said. Governor Gavin Newsom has floated a statewide ballot measure that would allow voters to weigh the proposal to adjust the state’s congressional map if the Texas GOP executes its plan. Robert Rivas, the Democratic speaker of the California state assembly, said, “We will fight fire with fire. And we will do whatever it takes to defend our democracy.” California is hosting Texas Democratic lawmakers who have left the state to break quorum and block gerrymandering. The Texas Democratic party chairman has responded to the lawsuit filed by Ken Paxton, the state’s Republican attorney general, seeking to remove 13 Democratic lawmakers from office, saying in a statement: Texas Democrats are exercising a long-standing, constitutionally protected right of the minority party to block extreme agendas – in this case, gerrymandering to keep Trump in power. These lawmakers have taken significant risks and sacrifices to stop Trump’s agenda, and despite all the threats they face, they remain undeterred, just like the rest of us. If Ken Paxton wants a fight, we will give him one.” Paxton has sought to enforce arrest warrants against the Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to stop Republicans from gerrymandering the congressional map in a manner that would add five more GOP seats. Some more background on what happened at the Texas house today: Billy Long, who is stepping down as the Internal Revenue Service commissioner only two months after he was appointed, has said he will be serving as ambassador to Iceland. The New York Times reported earlier today that Trump had Long removed, and that Long had clashed with Scott Bessent, treasury secretary, who will now serve as acting commissioner. Long is a former congressman from Missouri and close ally to the president who previously pushed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. The IRS has been run by six different people this year so far. Vladimir Putin has presented the Trump administration with a proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine if Kyiv makes major territorial concessions, according to a new Wall Street Journal report that cites European and Ukrainian officials. The proposal would require Ukraine that hand over the Donbas in the east of the country, which has led European officials to express serious reservations, the Journal reported. “European and Ukrainian officials, who were briefed by President Trump and Witkoff in a series of calls this week, said they worry Putin is simply using the offer as a ploy to avoid punishing new US sanctions and tariffs while continuing the war,” the Journal reported. The report was published as Trump, in a briefing with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, suggested there would “be some swapping of territories” to end the Ukraine invasion. The president spent a significant portion of the event discussing Russia, suggesting he would have more to announce soon and that he and Putin would be meeting “very shortly”. Trump has said he will soon have an update on Russia and would be meeting with Putin “very shortly”. Today was the original deadline he had set to end the Ukraine invasion or bring new sanctions. At the event with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the president made vague remarks about next steps, saying: President Putin I believe wants to see peace, and Zelenskyy wants to see peace. Now, President Zelenskyy has to get … everything he needs, because he’s going to have to get ready to sign something, and I think he is working hard to get that done. Asked if Zelenskyy would have to give up territory, the president responded: “You’re looking at territory that’s been fought over for three and a half years. A lot of Russians have died. A lot of Ukrainians have died. So we’re looking at that, but we’re actually looking to get some back and some swapping. It’s complicated.” Trump has said he would also soon announce details on the location of a meeting. The US president and the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have officially signed the peace agreement, establishing a so-called “Trump route for international peace and prosperity”. The corridor for transit and trade will connect mainland Azerbaijan with the autonomous Nakhchivan region, and the AP reported that the Trump administration said it was the Armenians who suggested naming it after the US president. Both leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan heaped praise on Trump and suggested he should receive a Nobel peace prize, which Trump has expressed interest in winning. In the state dining room, Donald Trump is flanked by the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, to his right, and the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, on his left. Trump says that both nations agree to “stop all fighting forever”. But a key part of the agreement is that it establishes what will be now known as “the Trump route for international peace and prosperity”. This is a key transit corridor that will have US development rights. Trump adds that he thinks Aliyev and Pashinyan are “going to have a great relationship”. The Texas House failed to meet quorum for a third time today, after only 95 of the 100 representatives needed were present. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers continue to defy Governor Greg Abbott’s demands to return, and remain out of state in protest over a new GOP-drawn congressional map. The Democrats’ next stop on their tour to deny quorum is California. They’ll hold a press conference at 5pm ET today with Governor Gavin Newsom in Sacramento. Abbott has spent the last 24 hours ratcheting up and repeating threats against the absent Democrats. He vowed to “call special session, after special session, after special session with the same agenda items on there”, in an interview with NBC News. Meanwhile, the Trump administration wasted no time today. A few standout items are below. First, the DoJ has issued two grand jury subpoenas to the New York attorney general, Letitia James, also a longtime Trump adversary, according to various reports. One of the subpoenas is tied to a civil fraud case her office brought against Trump, and the other is reportedly tied to the attorney general’s investigation into NRA. The Trump administration is also demanding that UCLA pay the federal government $1bn over multiple instalments to settle claims of antisemitism. That’s according to a report from CNN. If the proposal is agreed to, it would mark the biggest settlement the government has received from a higher education institution. And then, according to new reporting by the New York Times, the president has secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels that the Trump administration considers terrorist organizations. In response Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said her government had been informed of a coming order but that it had nothing to do with the US military operating on Mexican soil. Finally, for now at least, the Trump administration was handed a win when it comes to its ongoing showdown with the judiciary over the president’s immigration agenda. A federal appeals court overturned Judge James Boasberg’s ruling that found probable cause to hold Trump administration officials in contempt of court over their handling of the deportations of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants under the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act. The New York Times is reporting that Donald Trump is replacing the IRS commissioner, Billy Long, only two months after her was confirmed. Long is a former congressman from Missouri and a notable Trump ally – who pushed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. According to the Times, Long is being primed for an ambassador nomination. It is unclear who lead the agency next, according to the Times. Long is the sixth person to run the IRS this year alone, there have been four acting commissioners since Danny Werfel’s resignation in January, following Trump’s inauguration. A senior administration official tells the Times that treasury secretary Scott Bessent will be named acting commissioner. We’ll be bringing you the latest as Donald Trump prepares to welcome the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, followed by the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev. They’re expected to sign a peace deal, which would be a landmark development in decades of tension and fighting. Pashinyan is due to arrive soon. The meeting will be certainly be an opportunity for the president to highlight his “peacemaker-in-chief” bona fides, but peace is more elusive in one of the hallmark international conflicts of Trump’s second term. Today is Trump’s original deadline for Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. So far there’s been no update, but Trump has said he is ready to meet with Vladimir Putin despite the Russian leader’s refusal to sit-down with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The exact time and location remain undefined, but the UAE has been floated, given Putin’s refusal to talk in Kyiv. The Trump administration is demanding that the University of California, Los Angeles, pay the federal government $1bn over multiple installments to settle claims of antisemitism, according to a report from CNN. The settlement would also require UCLA to pay $172m to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, per CNN. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis race, color, religion, sex and national origin. CNN notes that if the proposal is agreed to, it would mark the biggest settlement the government has received from a higher education institution. CNN has not yet received comment from the University of California system. According to CNN’s reporting, “the proposed agreement prohibits overnight demonstrations and calls on the school to revise its policies and procedures on protests. It also requires UCLA to discontinue race and ethnicity-based scholarships and provide the resolution monitor with admissions data.” Burrows is now speaking and says that he and attorney general Ken Paxton have tried to make the civil arrest warrants they have filed against Democratic lawmakers “enforceable beyond state lines”. Also, notably, Burrows is enacting a new policy that states that any member breaking quorum will no longer have their paycheck or per diem deposited electronically. While the Capitol is not withholding pay – as that violates the state’s constitution – they are now stipulating that their paychecks must now be picked up in person. Burrows said the statehouse will withhold a percentage of absent Democrats’ monthly expenses, and any administrative work that requires the House’s approval will need to be done in person. The Texas legislature failed to meet quorum for a third time today, after only 95 of the 100 representatives needed were present. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers defied Governor Greg Abbott’s demands to return, and remain out of state in protest over a new GOP-drawn congressional map. Speaker Dustin Burrows attempted to reconvene the house today and meet quorum after it failed earlier this week. In an interview with Ruthless Podcast, Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, threatened to add “six, or seven or eight” new seats to the GOP-drawn congressional map that Democrats are already protesting by breaking quorum. The current proposal is a gerrymandered map that could secure Republicans five seats in Texas ahead of the 2026 midterms. When asked about how he sees this redistricting battle ending, Abbott was resolute: “One way or the other, they [Democrats] are coming back, and it’s going to end with these maps being passed.” The DOJ has issued two grand jury subpoenas to Letitia James, the New York attorney general and longtime Trump adversary, according to reports. One of the cases relates to a civil fraud case brought by James’s office against Trump, which resulted in the president owing New York state $500m, the New York Times reported. The other case relates to the attorney general’s investigation into National Rifle Association (NRA), a rightwing gun lobbying group. The investigation will raise further concerns that Trump is using the legal system to pursue personal vendettas. Last month the justice department announced a new “strike force” to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Barack Obama and top officials conspired to hurt Trump’s 2016 campaign, as legal experts told the Guardian that the department is “being used as a personal weapon” by Trump. “Any weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights,” James’s office said in a statement. Today, the hotel where several Texas Democrats are staying experienced a second bomb threat in one week, according to local police. The St Charles police department said that they conducted a thorough search of the area, and no explosive device was found. They confirmed that all 70 hotel guests are safe. Today’s bomb threat comes just days after an initial bomb threat at the same hotel, which is located in a suburb outside Chicago. It’s not immediately clear how many Texas lawmakers are still staying at the Q-Center hotel where the threats were made. In an interview with NBC News, Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, said he would call “special session, after special session, after special session with the same agenda items on there”, referring to the Democratic lawmakers who broke quorum this week. The legislators have vowed to stay out of Texas until at least the end of the current session, which ends on 19 August. In the interview, Abbott, a Republican, was undeterred. “Democrats act like they’re not going to come back as long as this is an issue,” Abbott said. “That means they’re not going to come back until like 2027 or 2028.” Since the quorum break, the legislative business of the entire session is now on ice. This includes relief for the victims of the catastrophic flooding that hit Texas last month. “There’s only one thing that’s denying our ability to get legislation passed. And it’s these Democrats who have fled the state, turned their backs on their fellow constituents,” Abbott said. “And those Democrats are going to lose their job in the upcoming election, if they don’t get kicked out before then, because they’re not stepping up helping out their constituents who are in desperate need.” It’s important to note that Republican House leadership in Texas chose to start the special session with the question of redistricting legislation. The Texas legislature is hoping to resume its special session today at 2pm ET, after Democratic lawmakers broke quorum for two consecutive days earlier this week in protest over a gerrymandered congressional map, drawn by the state’s GOP. For their part, the dozens of absent Democrats have hunkered down in blue states – such as Illinois, New York and Massachusetts – and have told the Guardian they plan to stay away from the Texas Capitol for “as long as it takes”. The Democrats’ next stop on their tour to deny quorum is California. Where they’ll hold a press conference at 5pm ET today with Governor Gavin Newsom and House speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, and attorney general, Ken Paxton, both Republicans, have threatened the legislators who left town with civil arrest warrants. Paxton has also promised to file court orders that would declare the Democrats’ seats vacant if they fail to return to Texas by Friday. Meanwhile, Texas senator John Cornyn, also a Republican, has said the FBI has agreed to help local law enforcement locate and arrest the legislators, despite none of them being been charged with a crime. For his part, Gavin Newsom has taken a leading role in the redistricting arms race that’s ensued, and pledged to retaliate against Republicans’ redistricting efforts by working to change California’s own congressional map. An advocacy group sued the US justice department and the FBI on Friday for records detailing their handling of the sex-trafficking investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The legal organization Democracy Forward is seeking records related to senior administration officials’ communications about Epstein documents and any regarding correspondence between Epstein and Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC, appears to be the first of its kind. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled. “The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal government often shields records related to criminal investigations from public view. The Epstein case has been subject to heightened public focus since the justice department said last month it would not release additional documents from the case. Meanwhile, top Trump officials reportedly met at the White House on Wednesday night to discuss strategy moving forward as the Trump administration continues to face criticism, including from Republicans, for its handling of the official files related to Epstein and the US president’s responses to calls for the release of all documents related to the criminal investigation. The meeting was reportedly hosted by JD Vance, with the gathering moved from the vice-president’s official residence to the White House, according to reporting by CNN. The meeting had been billed to include top Trump officials, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel. Vance and his staff had denied that a meeting to discuss the handling of the rumbling Epstein scandal was taking place. The Trump administration is now weighing whether to release recorded audio from the recent Department of Justice interview with Epstein’s convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said that members of the US military would not be entering Mexican territory after a news report that Washington may take such action to combat drug cartels. Earlier today, the New York Times (paywall) reported that Donald Trump had secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels. Sheinbaum said her government had been informed of a coming order but that it had nothing to do with the US military operating on Mexican soil. A US appeals court has overturned a lower court’s ruling finding probable cause to hold Trump administration officials in contempt of court over their handling of the deportations of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants under a centuries-old wartime law. US district judge James Boasberg found in April that officials could face criminal contempt charges for willfully disregarding his 15 March order barring the deportations to El Salvador of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act without the chance to challenge their removals. The Trump administration appealed. This morning, a three-judge panel of the DC circuit US court of appeals sided with the government by a 2-1 vote. Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both of whom were nominated by Donald Trump in his first term in the White House, concurred with the unsigned majority opinion. Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed by Barack Obama, dissented. “The District Court’s order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Katsas wrote in an opinion. The Washington division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) posted on X today – in the early hours – to show their presence alongside US park police. This comes after the White House committed to beef up federal law enforcement to combat crime in the nation’s capital, despite a 30-year low in violent crime in 2024, according to a report by the justice department. Trump firing labor statistics head won’t achieve his agenda, says former chief Donald Trump will need to take more radical action than simply firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) if he is determined to “cook the books” on jobs figures, the federal agency’s former commissioner has said. Erica Groshen, who ran the BLS during Barack Obama’s presidency, said meddling with how government statisticians calculate unemployment and labour market trends would require “a whole new cadre” of people to be brought in by a new commissioner. It would also provoke upheaval and a likely rash of whistleblowing among the existing workforce. Trump provoked widespread criticism last week by firing the BLS’s commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after weaker-than-expected jobs numbers for July and downward revisions for the two previous months, statistics that seemed to portend a looming economic slowdown. In an interview, Groshen said Trump’s reasoning for terminating McEntarfer had “no basis at all”. She said the decision was “very shocking” despite having warned of such a possibility earlier this year in a briefing paper that flagged changes in civil service employment classifications under Trump, which make it easer to fire senior officials deemed to be out of step with the president’s agenda. “This isn’t inconsistent with the way he’s acted in other situations,” she said. “[But] it’s a question of boundaries. I had quietly hoped and assumed it wouldn’t happen.” Read more here: We’re getting more updates from the Chevening House visit between JD Vance and the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy. Ahead of their meeting today, the US vice-president and Lammy took the opportunity to go carp fishing behind the estate. Alas, no fish were actually caught. Speaking to reporters, Lammy said that the pair will be “discussing the developing situation in the Middle East and in Gaza”, and Vance noted that the US has “no plans to recognise a Palestinian state” but “the president has been very moved by these terrible images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. So we want to make sure that we solve that problem.” As we wait for more on the meeting, here are a few snaps of the fruitless fishing expedition. According to new reporting by the New York Times, the president has secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels that the Trump administration considers terrorist organizations. According to the Times’ sources, US military officials have started drawing up options for how the military could go after the group. The Times also notes that this escalation would be the most “aggressive step” in the administration’s “campaign against cartels”. They also noted that this continues the president’s preference for using “military forces to carry out what has primarily been considered a law enforcement responsibility to curb the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs”. In February, the state department designated Tren de Aragua, MS-13 and several other organizations as foreign terrorist organizations. Today, a federal judge in Los Angeles will hear arguments in the Trump administration’s request to strike down the landmark Flores settlement agreement – a 1997 consent decree which provides basic rights and protections to child immigrants in its custody. The settlement also limits the length of time that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can hold children in custody to 72 hours, and requires them to be housed in safe and sanitary conditions. The administration argues that “unlawful family migration barely existed 1997”. They add that the agreement has prevented agencies from carrying out effective immigration policy. Last year, the same judge presiding over today’s hearing approved the Biden administration’s request to partially lift oversight protections at the Department of Health and Human Services. The agreement is still in place at CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies. During Trump’s first term in office, the administration asked a judge to dissolve the Flores settlement agreement, but its motion was struck down. The president’s day really kicks into gear at 2.30pm ET, when he will welcome the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, to the White House, followed by the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev. Donald Trump will hold separate meeting with the two leaders, and the day will culminate in a trilateral signing between the three nations. The president has characterised the day as a “Historic Peace Summit” on Truth Social, and touted his role as an international peacemaker. “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP’,” he said in his post. We’ve already seen some reaction to Donald Trump’s nomination of Stephen Miran – currently the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers – to fill the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking member on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee said in a statement late yesterday that Miran was “a Trump loyalist”. The Senate Banking committee is responsible for holding a confirmation hearing for the nominee. In her statement, Warren promised “tough questions” for Miran to determine “whether he’d serve the American people as an independent voice at the Fed or merely serve Donald Trump”. Donald Trump on Thursday demanded the immediate resignation of new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him “highly conflicted” due to his ties to Chinese firms and raising doubts about plans to turn around the struggling American chip icon. Reuters reported exclusively in April that Tan invested at least $200m in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military. Trump’s comments came a day after Reuters was first to report that Republican Senator Tom Cotton had sent a letter to Intel’s board chair with questions about Tan’s ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case involving his former firm Cadence Design. “The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Intel shares closed down 3% on Thursday. Donald Trump announced he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Friday for what he called a “Historic Peace Summit” aimed at ending decades of hostilities between the two former Soviet republics. Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister, and Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, “will join me at the White House for an official Peace Signing Ceremony,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social platform. Sworn enemies for decades, the two went to war twice over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Azerbaijan recaptured from Armenian forces in a lightning 2023 offensive, sparking the exodus of more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians. The two countries have held talks aimed at securing a peaceful resolution, including last month in the United Arab Emirates, but a breakthrough had proved elusive. Donald Trump on Thursday said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve while the White House seeks a permanent addition to the central bank’s governing board and continues its search for a new Fed chair. Miran, who has called for a complete overhaul of the Fed’s governance, will take over from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation last week, as she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University. The term expires 31 January, 2026 and is subject to approval by the Senate, Reuters reported. Trump said the White House continues to search for someone to serve in the 14-year Fed Board seat that opens 1 February. Trump is also weighing options for a successor to Fed chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends 15 May, 2026. The Trump administration is doubling to $50m a reward for the arrest of Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world’s largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the US with fentanyl-laced cocaine. “Under president Trump’s leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday in a video announcing the reward. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. At the time, the US offered a $15 million reward for his arrest. That was later raised by the Biden administration to $25 million — the same amount the US offered for the capture of Osama bin Laden following the 11 September, 2001, attacks. JD Vance kicks off a trip in the United Kingdom with a meeting with British foreign secretary David Lammy on Friday that will bring renewed scrutiny of Vance’s sharp criticism of Britain and its governing Labour party. The US vice-president, his wife, Usha, and their three young children are expected to land in London at the start of a trip that includes staying with Lammy at Chevening, the country residence used by the foreign minister, Reuters reported. They will later stay in the Cotswolds, a picturesque area of English countryside and a popular retreat for wealthy and influential figures, from footballers and film stars to media and political figures. The visit to the United Kingdom comes amid heightened transatlantic tensions, domestic political shifts in both countries and increased attention on Vance’s foreign policy views as he emerges as a key figure in president Donald Trump’s administration. A source familiar with the planning described the trip as a working visit that will include several official engagements, meetings and visits to cultural sites. Vance is also expected to meet with US troops. Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines from the day. There will be increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington DC, the White House announced yesterday, to combat crime for at least the next week. It comes amid Donald Trump’s suggestions that his administration could fully take over running the city, Associated Press reports. “Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens.” She added that the increased federal presence means “there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in DC”. Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining — but could face steep push back. “We have a capital that’s very unsafe,” Trump told reporters at the White House this week. “We have to run DC.” Trump’s intervention follows an alleged attack on on a federal employee who worked for the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

The Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and state house speaker Dustin Burrows have filed a lawsuit in Illinois to enforce arrest warrants against Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block Republicans from enacting a gerrymandered congressional map that would likely add five more Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. The civil petition was filed in an Adams county, Illinois, circuit court, about a four and a half hour drive from Chicago. More than 30 Texas Democratic members are named in the suit.

Israel’s political-security cabinet approved a plan early on Friday to take control of Gaza City, a move expanding military operations despite intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating, almost two-year-old war. Far-right allies in prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition have been pushing for a total takeover of Gaza as part of his vow to eradicate Hamas militants, though the military has warned this could jeopardise the lives of remaining hostages. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve while the White House seeks a permanent addition to the central bank’s governing board and continues its search for a new Fed chair. Miran, who has called for a complete overhaul of the Fed’s governance, will take over from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation last week, as she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University. Donald Trump will announce a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday 8 August, according to reports from both Reuters and CBS News. The respective leaders of both Azerbaijan and Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, will attend events at the White House tomorrow, despite decades-long tension between the two countries. Donald Trump has said he was ready to meet Vladimir Putin despite the Russian leader’s refusal to meet Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy – dispelling speculation that direct talks between the two warring presidents were a precondition to a high-level US-Russia summit. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said that Putin did not have to meet with Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet. Donald Trump has called on Intel’s chief executive to resign, alleging Lip-Bu Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock of the US chipmaker falling. “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”.
