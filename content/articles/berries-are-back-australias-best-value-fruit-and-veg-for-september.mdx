  “Springtime is tricky with fruit, because you’re getting rid of your winter
  citrus and the exotic summer stuff hasn’t started yet,” says owner and buyer
  Josh Flamminio at Sydney’s Galluzzo Fruiterers. But there are hints of what’s
  to come. “Mangoes have already started from the Northern Territory. We’re
  selling two for $10 at the moment,” says Flamminio. “They’re a good size –
  you’re not getting itsy-bitsy ones.” Once Queensland’s mango season begins,
  prices will come down further. Berry good prices Carmel Dawson, co-owner of
  Geelong Fresh Foods, says strawberry prices are already dropping. “We are
  selling large 500g punnets for only $3,” she says. “The quality is good and a
  real treat for our customers.” Strawberry supply is coming from Queensland and
  Western Australia, and with the overlap in growing areas it’s driving down the
  price. There are plenty of ways to make use of ample supply. If you really
  want to impress, try Helen Goh’s strawberry jelly panna cotta.
  “Bread-and-butter” Imperial mandarins have finished, but late-season variety
  Afourers still have another four or five in season. They’re selling for about
  $4.5o a kilo in supermarkets. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Late-picking apples
  are around, but they’re not at their best as many crops are likely to have
  been kept in coolers since autumn. At $1.50 apiece, Hass avocados should be on
  everyone’s menu in spring, Flamminio says, with supply coming from South
  Australia and Queensland. Blueberries have been up and down – they’re
  currently about $5 a punnet – but they should be in abundance in two or three
  weeks. The allure of summer stone fruit is still a while away, with cherries
  and lychees not expected until November. Green beans are plentiful Broccoli,
  spinach and cauliflower are all in season, with brussels sprouts still in good
  supply at about $9 a kilo. “All leafy greens start to flourish [in spring],”
  says Dawson. Cauliflower is as little as $2.50 a head. Whole roast a head of
  cauli to make Tony Tan’s char siu cauliflower with a Cantonese twist. Broccoli
  is about $4.50 a kilo, and just a month ago it was double the price per kilo –
  so now is the time to make Italian-style whole broccoli pasta. Its close
  relative broccolini is also as little as $2 a bunch. Flamminio says the best
  of the greens are English spinach, celery and cavolo nero (also known as
  Tuscan cabbage). Particularly plentiful in market, cavolo nero can be torn
  into Alice Zaslavsky’s blond minestrone for a warm lunch on cooler days,
  alongside potatoes and “beautiful” fennel, at $3.50 to $4 a bulb in
  supermarkets, says Flamminio. Spring favourite asparagus is on its way. It is
  still about $4.50 to $5 a bunch, though set to come down in a few weeks. Green
  beans – which have been expensive for a while – are now in a much better place
  for spring salads, at only about $6 a kilo. Try a French-inspired quick and
  easy red rice and green bean salad, with pomegranate molasses and sumac
  dressing. “They’re very plentiful in the market at the moment,” says
  Flamminio. Don’t truss the toms There has been a lot of rain in Queensland, so
  cherry truss tomatoes are $12-13 a kilo, so they’re best avoided at the
  moment, says Flamminio. But gourmet tomatoes and roma tomatoes are steady at
  about $5 a kilo, and not likely to rise in price soon. Stuff them with rice,
  as in Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pomodoro-al-riso. Buy: Afourer mandarins
