  Legalized wolf hunting in the western US has had only a minimal impact on
  preventing livestock loss, a new study led by the University of Michigan
  suggests. The research, published in Science Advances, compared data from
  Montana and Idaho, two states where public wolf hunts have been permitted,
  with Oregon and Washington, where hunting remains illegal. “Hunting, on the
  whole, is not removing negative impacts associated with wolves. It does have
  some effect on rates of livestock loss, but the effect is not particularly
  consistent, widespread or strong,” Neil Carter, senior author of the study,
  told University of Michigan News. Montana and Idaho launched their first
  regulated wolf hunts in 2009. At the time, officials hoped that cutting wolf
  populations would ease conflicts with ranchers who were losing cattle and
  sheep to predation. The assumption was that fewer wolves would mean fewer
  livestock deaths. But the data doesn’t seem to support this theory.
  Researchers reviewed trends in wolf numbers, government removals, and
  livestock depredation between 2005 and 2021. Their analysis showed that
  eliminating one wolf amounted to protecting only about 7% of a single cow. Put
  another way, about 14 wolves would have to be killed to save one cow. Current
  wolf populations are estimated at about 1,100 in Montana and more than 1,200
  in Idaho. The study also revealed that state and federal wildlife agencies are
  not called on any less often to remove wolves, even where public hunts take
  place. In 2024, Montana hunters and trappers killed 297 wolves, while ranchers
  still reported losing 62 livestock animals to wolves, according to Montana
  Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Wolf hunting itself has been subject to ongoing
  legal disputes. In 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service declared that gray
  wolves had recovered enough to be delisted from the Endangered Species Act,
  but a court reversed that decision in 2022. However, the researchers are not
  aiming to have their findings be used in the wolf hunting debate. “This paper
  isn’t about whether or not we should be hunting,” Leandra Merz, a co-author of
  the study told NPR. “We’re talking about finding a management tool that will
  help ranchers manage livestock predation.”
