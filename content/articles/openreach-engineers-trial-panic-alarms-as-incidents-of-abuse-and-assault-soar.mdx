  From scissors being brandished as weapons to verbal abuse and being trapped
  during a home visit, the number of reported incidents of abuse and assault on
  telecoms engineers is on the rise. Openreach, the BT subsidiary that maintains
  the vast majority of the broadband network serving UK homes and businesses,
  recorded 450 reports of abuse and assault in the year to the end of March. The
  number of incidents involving Openreach employees was up 8% year-on-year, a
  40% increase on 2022-23 and seven times the volume reported almost a decade
  ago. Abuse and assault has for the first time become the largest cause of
  injury to Openreach office staff and its 22,000 field engineers. Managers
  believe the number of incidents is even higher, as many cases are not reported
  by staff. “I used to be worried about people falling off ladders, road traffic
  accidents or tripping over potholes,” said Adam Elsworth, health and safety
  director at Openreach. “But actually we have seen a steady increase in
  violence and abuse. “A quarter of all the accidents we record are now someone
  being attacked or abused, and it is continuing to rise. And when I look at
  these incidents I struggle to see the rationale behind the level of
  escalation.” Incidents reported by engineers include being shouted at, sworn
  at or spat at, the blocking of vehicles, being shaken off stepladders, or
  pushed down stairs while working at someone’s home. There are also reports of
  racial abuse, inappropriate and threatening behaviour towards female
  engineers, homeowners preventing staff from leaving and specific incidents
  such as scissors being brandished like a weapon and a customer repeatedly
  slamming a vehicle door on an engineer’s leg. For Openreach, around half of
  incidents are in public locations, 45% are at homes and the remainder occur at
  the company’s yards or estate. Elsworth said Openreach was trialling a “panic
  alarm” on engineers’ mobile phones, which connects them in seconds to a
  monitoring centre that has the power to directly dispatch emergency services
  if required. “If an engineer is at someone’s home, that is quite a vulnerable
  space to be,” he said. “Some of the incidents are quite disproportionate and
  have created a wariness among engineers. When someone has been attacked, they
  are then thinking every time they knock on a door what could be coming next.
  “A number of these cases do get reported to police, particularly in the case
  of the more severe ones. It is difficult when there is a threat element.”
  While Openreach faces the largest number of incidents, it is also a growing
  issue for other telecoms operators. Virgin Media O2, which has around 4,000
  employees working on its cable network and cell masts, reported 26 incidents
  last year covering physical encounters, verbal abuse and threatening
  behaviour. However, so far this year the reported number of incidents is up
  significantly, tracking at a rate that would mean the number doubling for the
  full year. “Our frontline teams work tirelessly to provide reliable mobile and
  broadband services millions of customers rely on every day,” said a
  spokesperson. “A single incident of abuse or threatening behaviour is one too
  many, and we’re committed to ending workplace violence and keeping our people
  safe.” At Sky the number of incidents involving engineers in the field reached
  99 last year, although the company said it was not seeing any upward trend
  this year. Sky said it was back to pre-Covid levels of incidents after an
  increase during the pandemic, with a peak of 392 reported incidents in 2021.
  The newly-formed VodafoneThree collated about 40 to 50 incidents, while
  BT-owned EE did not reveal numbers but said that the figure was low. Last
  month, the major telecoms companies were among 100 co-signatories of an open
  letter from the Institute of Customer Service (ICS) calling on the government
  to amend the crime and policing bill. The bill will make it a standalone
  offence for assault on a retail worker, the sector that has been the most
  vocal about the safety and security of staff. As it stands the bill does not
  offer any protection for customer-facing workers across other sectors –
  including telecoms and infrastructure – with the ICS estimating that about 60%
  of the UK workforce operates in some form of customer-facing role. “You hear
  about the situation in sectors such as retail, trains, public transport but
  telecoms is a bit of a forgotten child in this,” said Elsworth. “But when you
  are talking about engineers in someone’s home, well that’s quite a unique
  challenge.”
