  A vacancy has arisen on the left of Liverpool’s forward line and an early,
  eye-catching application to fill the role has arrived from a 16-year-old. Rio
  Ngumoha further enhanced his first‑team claims with a sparkling display
  against Athletic Bilbao that underlined the formidable strength, and options,
  available to Arne Slot. Ngumoha opened the scoring superbly and teed up a goal
  for Darwin Núñez inside five minutes at Anfield in the first of two pre-season
  friendlies against the Basque club. A packed Anfield crowd had to wait for the
  second fixture to catch a first glimpse of new signings Florian Wirtz, Milos
  Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitiké and Jeremie Frimpong. Ngumoha kept
  them entertained before then as Liverpool recorded a comfortable 4-1 win in
  match one. The second game also went Liverpool’s way, a 3-2 victory in which
  Wirtz, Ekitiké and Frimpong added to the flowing, blistering quality of the
  champions’ attacking play. Ngumoha is not eligible to sign a professional
  contract until he turns 17 on the 29th of this month but showed why Chelsea
  were livid when Liverpool tempted him away from their academy last summer. In
  only the second minute of his second senior appearance at Anfield the
  teenager, who made his full debut against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup
  last season, set off from halfway and, with Athletic defenders all in retreat,
  curled an excellent finish into the bottom corner of the Kop goal from 20
  yards. The left winger produced something similar in Liverpool’s previous
  pre‑season outing against Yokohama F Marinos last week. That goal came on the
  day Luis Díaz completed his £65.5m transfer to Bayern Munich, creating an
  opening on the left that could be filled by any one of Cody Gakpo, Wirtz,
  Ekitiké and perhaps the 16-year-old talent from London. His display was enough
  to prompt chants of “Rio” from the Kop and a song in his honour from the
  singer who appeared during the interval. Ngumoha’s emergence – predicted with
  confidence by John Terry when he lamented the youngster’s exit from Chelsea –
  is timely for Liverpool as they await Newcastle’s next move on Alexander Isak.
  There may not be a rush to replace Díaz directly given the options already at
  Slot’s disposal. The Premier League champions can afford to wait on their
  prime target for the No 9 role and leave their £110m offer for Isak on
  Newcastle’s table. Three minutes after his individual goal Ngumoha headed down
  a Ben Doak cross for Núñez to convert from close range. Anyone looking for
  clues as to Núñez’s next step – with Al-Hilal interested in taking him to the
  Saudi Pro League – will have noted the hand-on-the-heart celebration that
  followed from the £60m-rated Uruguay international in front of the Kop. A
  glimpse of Liverpool’s past and future, perhaps. Doak and Harvey Elliott, two
  other players who could leave Anfield in this window, were also on the
  scoresheet in the first contest against Ernesto Valverde’s side. Ngumoha’s
  footwork and pace also impressed in the 67 minutes he was on the pitch. He
  received a well-earned rousing reception when replaced by Trent Koné-Doherty.
  The opening game started at 5pm as scheduled despite supporters in the Main
  Stand having to be evacuated just over an hour before kick-off due to a false
  alarm. Liverpool’s first appearance on home soil since the tragic deaths of
  Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, was marked by the club’s former
  captain Phil Thompson and Athletic president, Jon Uriarte, laying wreaths in
  front of the Kop before the game. There were moving moments 20 minutes into
  both games when everyone inside the stadium rose to their feet to applaud
  Liverpool’s No 20. Play stopped and players from both teams also joined in the
  applause for Jota and Silva. Slot was without Virgil van Dijk for both Bilbao
  games due to illness. The Liverpool head coach indicated the club captain
  could be a doubt for Sunday’s Community Shield against Crystal Palace. Conor
  Bradley and Joe Gomez were also absent through injury, forcing Slot to deploy
  18-year-old midfielder Trey Nyoni in central defence for the first Bilbao
  contest and Luca Stephenson at right-back. Goalkeeper Alisson was unavailable
  having left Liverpool’s recent pre‑season tour of Asia due to personal
  reasons. Summer signings Freddie Woodman and Armin Pecsi filled in, playing
  one half each, while Georgia international Mamardashvili made his Anfield bow
  in the second game behind a central defence of Ibrahima Konaté and Wataru
  Endo. That is one department where the champions appear light at present.
  Ngumoha could add to their riches up front.
