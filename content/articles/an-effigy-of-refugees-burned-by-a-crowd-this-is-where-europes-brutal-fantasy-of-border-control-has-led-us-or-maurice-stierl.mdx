  The burning of an effigy of refugees on a boat to the cheers of a riled-up
  crowd in Moygashel, Northern Ireland shows where we are today. A decade has
  passed since Europe’s border crisis in 2015 and the shock caused by the image
  of Alan Kurdi, whose little body was found washed up on a Turkish beach.
  Sentiments of welcome and solidarity were short lived and have given way to a
  seemingly never-ending obsession in Europe with “stopping the boats” and
  reducing the number of migrant arrivals. In the decade since Angela Merkel’s
  “we can do it”, we have become used to hearing that 2015 must not be allowed
  to happen again. Across Europe, politicians routinely vow to fight migration,
  “smash” smuggling gangs, ramp up border controls and build up detention and
  deportation capacities. A much-criticised migration pact was agreed upon while
  the annual budget of Frontex, the EU border agency, has seen a staggering
  increase, from €97.9m in 2014 to €922m in 2024. Entire border zones have
  become militarised and the guarding of borders has been “externalised” so that
  non-EU countries can prevent migration on Europe’s behalf. In this past
  decade, we have also become desensitised to the inevitable consequences of
  such repressive policies in terms of human suffering and loss. Reports and
  images of people forced into Libyan torture and rape sites, described by
  German diplomats as “concentration camp-like” in 2017, no longer prompt a
  public outcry. Neither do the deaths of thousands in the Mediterranean every
  year or the criminalisation of activists who seek to avert mass drowning.
  Shipwrecks have become so common that they hardly make it into the news. What
  does make the news, however, is the discourse on migration that characterises
  it as an emergency. Often dominating headlines, it has become a permanent
  feature, a sort of enduring state of exception that far-right forces
  capitalise on. Instead of offering alternative visions of migration, parties
  of the so-called “centre” or “mainstream” amplify such crisis talk, catering
  to simplistic control fantasies and offering one solution only: more borders.
  Whether it’s the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats in Germany,
  Labour in the UK or Emmanuel Macron’s government in France, mainstream parties
  seek to outdo parties to the right of them by pushing increasingly extreme and
  racist narratives, at times dangerously close to invasion and “great
  replacement” conspiracies. In January, the French prime minister, François
  Bayrou, spoke of a “feeling of submersion” in view of the migrant presence in
  France. In May, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, suggested that the
  UK was at risk of turning into an “island of strangers”. In June, the German
  chancellor, Friedrich Merz, claimed on Fox News that the past decade’s
  migration to Germany had led to “imported” antisemitism, so that fighting
  antisemitism meant fighting migration. Promising to solve societal problems
  through repressive migration policies and more borders, these “centrist” or
  even “progressive” political leaders are selling a dangerous fantasy. In a
  world riven by war, genocide, economic disparity, a climate catastrophe and
  growing authoritarianism, borders will never succeed in averting people’s
  desire and need to migrate or flee. Indeed, the fantasy of borders is met,
  time and again, by reality: ongoing migration. Distracting from the inability
  to address any of the structural issues underpinning migration and
  displacement, and in ever-greater desperation, we are being served “border
  spectacles” – performative but nonetheless violent and racist acts of
  exclusion, demarcating those who supposedly belong and those who do not. In
  the long shadow of the “crisis” of 2015, we see intersecting developments
  across Europe that should worry us. First, a shift to the far right and
  growing authoritarianism. In Germany, the extremist Alternative for Germany
  (AfD) has comfortably established itself as the largest opposition party, at
  times leading in the polls, as do the Reform UK and National Rally parties in
  the UK and France respectively. Supposedly mainstream political parties have
  not only failed to stop the rise of the far right, they have contributed to
  mainstreaming their rhetoric and authoritarian policies. More than that, by
  intensifying migration cooperation with repressive regimes outside Europe,
  they have contributed to the rise of authoritarianism elsewhere. Tunisia
  serves as one of many examples where Europe’s financial and political support
  has strengthened the security apparatus of its authoritarian leader, Kais
  Saied, who himself has spewed great replacement theories on migration. Second,
  a shift away from the idea of a “post-national” community. The constant
  promise that borders will solve migration has reinforced the illusion that
  renationalisation is the answer. The departure of the UK from the EU, whose
  disastrous “taking back of control” in fact prompted an increase in migration
  post-Brexit, may be the most obvious example. However, throughout the EU, we
  see an increase in “borderisation” – the erection of barriers and border
  controls between member states – as a way to supposedly reclaim “lost”
  sovereignty. The very core of the European project – internal freedom of
  movement – is at risk and points to a growing estrangement from the idea of
  Europe as a post-national community. Third, an assault on legal norms and
  institutions. The normalisation of anti-migration violence, including through
  mass pushbacks, has led to a clear erosion of human rights. Indeed, some EU
  member states have legalised human rights violations at borders while Greece
  decided to temporarily suspend asylum altogether this July. International
  institutions meant to protect refugees, including the UN refugee agency, have
  been under assault while we see a concerted hollowing out of international
  rights standards and the gradual death of asylum. Even if the European
  obsession with borders fails to do what is desired – effective deterrence – it
  has real and dangerous consequences, for those seeking refuge and for us all.
  The burning of an effigy of refugees is what happens after a decade of
  dehumanisation. In the intervening years, many – from the supposed centre to
  the far right – have implanted a dangerous border fantasy that will continue
  to divide, hurt and kill. Dr Maurice Stierl is a migration and border
