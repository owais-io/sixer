  If you’ve visited a specialist recently, you may have felt the hit to your hip
  pocket. Patients are paying hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars out of
  pocket for healthcare as some doctors charge not just double, but triple, the
  Medicare rebate. While GPs face pressure to bulk bill, there is no similar
  conversation about non-GP specialists, despite the fact they are also trained
  in the public system and remunerated through Medicare, experts told Guardian
  Australia when we recently wrote about this issue. The effectiveness of the
  government’s much-derided Medical Costs Finder website is limited by the fact
  that as of March, only 70 specialists – out of 11,000 registered to practise –
  choose to voluntarily display their fee information. But even if there was
  more transparency around costs, there is no policy in place that would
  actually lower these fees. Non-profit Patients Australia says part of the
  problem is that specialist doctors are increasingly adding a “booking fee” or
  an “administration fee” to the patient’s bill. This practice, known as split
  billing, not only raises the price but also means the extra cost is invisible
  to the government and private insurers. Share your experience Whether it’s a
  surgeon or physician, psychiatrist or gynaecologist, we want to hear about
  your experiences accessing specialist care and what you’re being charged.
  Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish. For
