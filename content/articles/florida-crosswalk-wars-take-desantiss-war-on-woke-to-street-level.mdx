  A battalion of transportation workers armed with cans of black paint has been
  deployed to open a new front in Ron DeSantis’s “war on woke”, while young
  students trying to make their schools safer have joined the LGBTQ+ community
  as targets of Florida’s Republican governor. The saga began with the state
  moving in the dead of night to paint over a rainbow-colored crosswalk outside
  Orlando’s former Pulse nightclub, where 49 people were killed in a 2016
  shooting. The city’s mayor, Buddy Dyer, called the erasure of the memorial to
  the mostly LGBTQ+ victims “a cruel political act”. Since then, DeSantis’s
  crosswalk wars have spread across Florida. The governor has ordered the
  removal of about 400 “non-standard” pieces of street art, even though they all
  received state approval as a condition of installation. A growing number of
  municipalities has pledged to fight him. The state’s declared intent,
  acquiescent to a national directive by the Trump administration last month, is
  to “keep our transportation facilities free and clear of political
  ideologies”, Florida’s transport secretary, Jared Perdue, wrote in a post to
  X. Perdue has also said painted roadways are a safety hazard, despite research
  showing improved driver behavior and a “significantly improved safety
  performance” at sites that have art installations. The purge, which has
  targeted more than just rainbow crosswalks and other street symbols of LGBTQ+
  pride street decorations, has reverberated in cities from Tallahassee to Key
  West. Several municipalities, under threat of losing state funding, have
  complied. Those include Port St Lucie, which removed hearts painted on a
  roadway as a memorial to a teenager who died of a heart condition, and Daytona
  Beach, which painted over checkered flag crosswalks at the city’s famous
  international speedway. More than a dozen schools in Tampa were also snared,
  and will lose vibrant asphalt artwork designed by students installed as part
  of the city’s award-winning Crosswalks to Classrooms program. Florida’s
  department of transportation (FDOT) recognized it as a gold standard of road
  safety only four years ago. “The innovative and collaborative efforts to
  combine public art and engineering treatments to improve school safety was
  truly inspiring,” a department official said at the time. In Orlando, bicycle
  lanes painted in May at an elementary school, designed by fourth-graders who
  won a FDOT art contest, must also go. DeSantis, at a press conference in
  Tampa, was unrepentant. He suggested students use his street art directive
  outlawing “social, political or ideological messages” as a civics lesson.
  “What I would tell kids is we have a representative system of government.
  People elect their representatives. They’re able to enact the legislation with
  the governor’s signature and then when that happens, obviously people will
  conform their conduct accordingly,” he said. Other cities are digging in their
  heels, setting up a likely legal fight with the DeSantis administration. A
  special meeting of the Fort Lauderdale commission on Wednesday voted to file
  an administrative appeal against a removal order on four pieces of
  pride-themed street art in the city, including a large rainbow flag. “Tonight,
  we must stand our ground. We cannot allow ourselves to be bullied into
  submission and to allow others to dictate what we should do in our own
  communities,” Dean Trantalis, the mayor of Fort Lauderdale, said. Trantalis
  has previously called the governor’s crosswalk directive an act of “irrational
  vengeance” on the LGBTQ+ community. Commissioners also voted to hire the same
  firm of outside attorneys contracted by officials in Key West and Miami Beach,
  two other cities known for inclusivity, to help in the legal fight. Delray
  Beach commissioners voted earlier this month to defy the state and retain its
  giant pride streetscape. An administrative hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.
  Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative for Orlando, noted DeSantis’s
  long history of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation – including the “don’t say gay” bill
  and efforts to ban or restrict gender-affirming healthcare – and saw deeper
  menace in the crosswalk orders. “It’s not just, ‘I despise queer people,’
  which is clearly a part of the MO here, it’s bigger than that,” she said.
  “It’s trying to control what local governments can and can’t do and an effort
  to essentially target, harass, bully and potentially even eliminate them.
  Overwhelmingly, cities that have these crosswalks do not support DeSantis and
  didn’t vote for him. These are the same municipalities that are now getting
  Doge, the same municipalities where DeSantis is trying to take away property
  taxes, which means no revenue and the consolidation and elimination of local
  governments. “It’s worth connecting the dots. It’s not as simplistic as
  another culture war on LGBTQ+ people.” Charlie Crist, the former Republican
  Florida governor who switched parties to become a Democratic congressman, and
  challenged DeSantis for governor in 2022, said it was an “absurd and
  embarrassing” effort to silence residents. “It’s hard to understand. We have a
  right to free speech in this country, and these murals in our cities and our
  communities reflect the values of those communities and cities,” he said. “The
  notion that the state government would want to suppress that right of free
  speech is bizarre.” Crist said he also saw the move as an extension of
  DeSantis’s targeting of minority groups: “It’s hard to draw a different
  conclusion, frankly, and I don’t understand it. I believe in the golden rule
  to do unto others as you would have done unto you, and I don’t think DeSantis
  knows what that is. It’s disappointing.” Nadine Smith, executive director of
  Equality Florida, predicted the push to remove pride street art would
  backfire. “DeSantis may paint over rainbows and art, but people are answering
  with defiance, chalking sidewalks, raising flags, covering cars with stickers,
  and businesses painting their parking lots with rainbows. These acts declare
  we are not intimidated and we will not be erased,” she said in a statement.
  “This isn’t about safety. It’s a cowardly abuse of power and the latest in his
  campaign to ban books, whitewash history, and attack LGBTQ people. Cities must
  push back to protect the values that make them welcoming places to live, work,
  and visit.”
