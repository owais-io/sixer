  It’s almost impossible to divide superheroes along political lines. Captain
  America might seem like a patriotic, commie-bashing lunatic, as he was in the
  1950s comics during the McCarthy era, until you remember that he has also
  spent much of his fictional career telling corrupt government agencies to
  shove it. And, in the Marvel Comic Universe, at least, he went on the run
  rather than sign up for an authoritarian superhero registry. Superman was once
  the square-jawed poster boy for US exceptionalism, cheerfully posing on
  propaganda comic covers urging readers to buy war bonds, but he’s also been
  written as a Kansas farm boy so suspicious of concentrated power that in one
  storyline he renounced his citizenship to avoid being used as a pawn of US
  foreign policy. Bar a few outliers – Iron Man cheerleading the
  military-industrial complex in his earliest comics springs to mind – trying to
  pin a superhero to one side of the political spectrum is like trying to staple
  fog: most of DC and Marvel’s big beasts will drift wherever the story, or the
  writer’s mortgage payments, takes them. Which is why it’s been so bizarre
  watching the right’s disgust as a vaguely woke man of steel drives all before
  him at the summer box office. James Gunn’s Superman passed the
  half-billion-dollar mark globally this week, which hardly means we’re looking
  at a film to mirror the success of the early comic book movie era – Batman v
  Superman: Dawn of Justice somehow made $874m, for chrissakes – but does at
  least indicate that audiences quite like this new, down-to-earth, kindly and
  human take on Kal-El. Gunn is now producing next Wonder Woman. Meanwhile, on
  the dystopian side of the news cycle, Dean Cain has declared himself primed
  and ready to join Donald Trump’s Ice agency. Cain (Kal-El in 90s TV series
  Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman) only recently declared his
  horror at how “woke” the new David Corenswet Supes has turned out to be. Are
  these two things connected? Is Cain trying to make the point that a real
  “superman” would be standing at America’s borders, demanding paperwork from
  asylum seekers and Frisbeeing their lunch into the nearest bin, rather than
  attempting to stop evil invaders from terrorising a rival nation (as Corenswet
  does in Superman)? It’s almost as if, in the absence of the kind of superhero
  movies Cain would like to see muscle their way into multiplexes, the actor
  sees it as his patriotic duty to bring hard-border fiction into reality. If
  the 74 million who voted for Trump don’t want these woke Marvel and DC
  superhero movies, and would really rather see films in which caped crusaders
  defend gated communities against suspiciously accented delivery drivers, isn’t
  Hollywood missing a trick? Isn’t there – somewhere – a gap in the market, or
  perhaps an alternative reality – Earth 45? Earth-Fox News? – where filmgoers
  queue around the block to watch Captain Constitution and the Stand Your Ground
  Squad, and the Hollywood trades wax lyrical about a new blockbuster era of
  paranoia and punitive zoning laws? The right has tried this already, of
  course. Cain was also pretty upset about Disney’s recent “woke” Snow White
  remake, perhaps because the princess didn’t spend the runtime pining for a man
  or whistling while she ironed. And so was conservative media outfit the Daily
  Wire, which at the height of the backlash against Rachel Zegler’s casting made
  a trailer for a then-forthcoming rival film titled Snow White and the Evil
  Queen. Plot details were thin on the ground, but presumably involved the
  heroine abandoning woodland animals for a concealed-carry permit and learning
  the value of hard work by running her own small business into the ground
  without government subsidies. We’ll never really know because the film appears
  to have been quietly cancelled, leaving a potential audience of millions
  bereft of the chance to see what happens when you trade magic mirrors for
  voter ID checkpoints. Perhaps the lesson here is that it’s just really
  difficult to make dreamy-eyed fantasy flicks that double as Breitbart comment
  threads. And it’s not just superhero movies that would creak under the strain.
  Imagine Star Wars if rebellions were built not on hope but on stricter border
  controls and mandatory midichlorian checks. Would The Lord of the Rings have
  really been quite the same if all those ’orrible orcs and trolls had been
  replaced on the battlefield by desperate migrants trying to reach the Shire,
  being enthusiastically biffed by an over-xcited Aragorn and Gimli counting
  down the number of “illegals” they just tonked? Sooner or later, someone’s
  going to make a superhero film or TV series that gives the Maga crowd
  everything: a caped crusader who fights windfarms, sues the Daily Planet for
  libel and pays for everything in gold bullion or crypto. (The Boys got close
  at times: Homelander is basically what happens when you cross Captain America
  with a Trump rally and a gallon of unpasteurised milk, but he was hardly a
  hero – and perhaps that’s the point.) Until then, the culture warriors will
  have to settle for grumbling about woke elves and lady Thor while the rest of
  us watch Superman save the world from the nastiest supervillains in the
  universe without checking anyone’s passport. • This article was amended on 8
  August 2025 to remove text which suggested that James Gunn was hired to write
  Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow and Clayface. In fact Gunn was a producer on
  those films.
