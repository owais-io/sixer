  US lawmakers are asking UnitedHealth Group, the nation’s largest healthcare
  conglomerate, to disclose internal documents about its efforts to reduce
  hospital transfers for nursing home residents and the bonuses it has given to
  nursing homes which help it to do so. In a 6 August letter, the Democratic
  senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren asked UnitedHealth’s CEO, Stephen
  Hemsley, to hand over a trove of company records about a partnership program
  it has with nursing homes across the country, which aims to decrease
  hospitalizations and thereby coverage expenses for the conglomerate. The
  document demand letter follows a Guardian investigation into the initiative.
  “Put simply, these allegations suggest that UHG [UnitedHealth Group] appears
  to be prioritizing its bottom line at the expense of the health and safety of
  nursing home residents enrolled in UHG I-SNPs,” Wyden and Warren wrote,
  referring to a type of UnitedHealth plan for long-term nursing home residents.
  “Nursing home residents and their families should not live in fear of a
  for-profit health care company withholding care when it is most critical.”
  UnitedHealth argues the program is designed to curb “unnecessary”
  hospitalizations. The company has vigorously denied the allegations in the
  Guardian’s 21 May investigation, which was based on thousands of confidential
  corporate and patient records, public records requests and court files,
  interviews with more than 20 current and former UnitedHealth and nursing home
  employees, and two whistleblower declarations submitted to Congress in May
  through the non-profit legal group Whistleblower Aid. “We stand firmly behind
  the integrity of our I-SNP program, which consistently receives high
  satisfaction ratings,” said a UnitedHealth Group company spokesperson. “The
  allegations stem from an article that misrepresents a program that provides
  high-quality care, personalized on-site clinical care and enhanced
  coordination among caregivers. The US Department of Justice extensively
  reviewed these allegations and found no evidence of wrongdoing.” Wyden’s and
  Warren’s offices received a briefing from UnitedHealth on 29 July about the
  program. Both lawmakers, who sit on the powerful Senate finance committee,
  said they “remained concerned” about several aspects of the UnitedHealth
  nursing home initiative, according to the 6 August letter. The senators
  pointed out, for example, that UnitedHealth pays some nursing homes bonuses
  based on their residents’ rate of hospital transfers, as the Guardian
  previously reported. But that bonus metric “does not take into account
  avoidable versus unavoidable hospitalizations, but rather sets a cap on
  hospitalizations for any reason, potentially making it a poor measure of
  quality of care”, the letter notes. The company has previously said that its
  bonus payments to nursing homes help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations,
  which can be costly and dangerous, to patients and that its partnerships with
  nursing homes improve health outcomes. Wyden and Warren are also seeking
  information about how the company markets its plans under Medicare Advantage,
  a privatized alternative to traditional Medicare, to nursing home residents,
  and about how its employees talk to residents about advanced care directives
  which can affect their ability to access hospital care. The senators are
  requesting information, too, on whether federal regulators have sanctioned
  certain UnitedHealth Medicare Advantage plans geared toward long-term nursing
  home residents within the last five years. The healthcare conglomerate has
  faced lawsuits alleging its employees have improperly attempted to enroll
  nursing home residents into its Medicare Advantage plans and have risked or
  harmed residents’ health by helping to delay or avoid critical hospital
  transfers. UnitedHealth has denied these allegations. Under Medicare
  Advantage, the federal government pays insurers fixed sums to cover the care
  of seniors, a model which critics contend can encourage inappropriate tactics
  to slash coverage expenses. UnitedHealth has previously alleged that the
  Guardian’s reporting was “blatantly false and misleading” and said that the
  suggestion that its employees have prevented hospital transfers “is verifiably
  false”. UnitedHealth sued the Guardian for libel shortly after the outlet
  informed the company it was publishing a follow-up investigation into the
  nursing home program. The document demand letter from Wyden and Warren comes
  just a few months after lawmakers from both parties expressed rare bipartisan
  concern about UnitedHealth’s activities inside nursing homes. In June, two
  congressional Democrats – representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York
  and Lloyd Doggett of Texas – sent a letter to the Department of Justice asking
  it to “thoroughly review new revelations from investigative reporting and
  whistleblower complaints, which suggest that UnitedHealth may have engaged in
  illegal activities”. Likewise, Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican on the
  Senate investigations subcommittee, vowed to secure “justice for patients,
  policyholders and whistleblowers alike who’ve been harmed by insurance
  companies”. In their letter on Thursday, Wyden and Warren asked UnitedHealth
  to provide “a provide a full, written response” to their inquiry by 8
  September. In its statement, UnitedHealth said it would “continue to educate
  their staff and share information on the I-SNP model and its proven benefit
  for seniors”.
