  In the third month of this tense, parched summer, the British state is under
  severe strain. Stripped of resources by 14 years of reckless rightwing
  government, contorting itself to maintain relations with ever more extreme
  regimes abroad, expanding its security powers at home through ever more
  tortured logic, regarded by ever more voters with contempt, a once broadly
  respected institution is increasingly struggling to maintain its authority.
  You could see the strain on the faces of some of the police officers,
  reddening with exertion in the sun, as they arrested 521 people in Parliament
  Square on Saturday for displaying pieces of paper or cardboard with a
  seven-word message supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. It was
  one of the biggest mass arrests in London’s history. The many protesters who
  refused to be led away had to be lifted off the ground, one by one, without
  the exercise looking too coercive in front of the cameras. Then their floppy,
  uncooperative forms had to be carried by clusters of officers through the
  hostile crowd – to chants of “genocide police!”, “shame on you!” and “fascist
  scum!” – to a ring of police vans at the square’s perimeter, which were then
  sometimes obstructed by further protesters, before they eventually drove away.
  So many officers were needed that some had come from Wales. When Tony Blair’s
  Labour government introduced Welsh devolution 26 years ago, in times of more
  harmony and less scarcity, cooperation between the nations was probably not
  envisaged in this form. On Saturday, so that the capital’s police custody
  system was not overwhelmed, those arrested were taken to “makeshift outdoor
  processing centres”, the Observer reported – as if during a general breakdown
  of law and order. Some of those released on bail then reportedly went back to
  the protest. “Given the numbers of people arrested,” said the Metropolitan
  police, “it would have been entirely unrealistic for officers to recognise
  individuals who returned to [the square].” “Entirely unrealistic” is not a
  reassuring phrase for those who believe that the government’s approach to
  Palestine Action is practical and based on sound law. If charged, those
  arrested will enter the overburdened criminal justice system and then, if
  found guilty, Britain’s bursting jails. It’s likely that further supporters of
  Palestine Action will follow. The organiser of Saturday’s protest, Defend Our
  Juries, has promised a sustained campaign of “mass, public defiance”, to make
  the proscription of Palestine Action “unworkable”. This amendment to the 2000
  Terrorism Act – a less benign legacy of Blair than devolution – states that
  anyone who “wears, carries or displays an article” publicly, “in such a way…
  as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a member or supporter of”
  Palestine Action could be jailed for up to six months; and anyone who “invites
  support for” the organisation could be jailed for up to 14 years.
  Authoritarianism and austerity have risen together in Britain, as the
  relatively generous public spending of the Blair years has receded and new
  waves of radical activism have formed over the climate crisis and the
  destruction of Palestine. Yet the possibility that austerity will make
  authoritarianism unaffordable, with too much of the government’s funds
  swallowed up by the security state, does not seem prominent in Labour’s
  thinking. The fact that Keir Starmer is a former director of public
  prosecutions and that the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has for many years
  been one of parliament’s leading authorities on national security, has given
  them a lot of faith in law-and-order solutions to political problems. The
  Parliament Square protesters took a different view. They had been advised by
  Defend Our Juries not to give quotes to journalists, to avoid distracting from
  the protest’s focus on the Palestine Action proscription and the genocide in
  Gaza. Yet the dozen protesters I spoke to informally all talked about
  Britain’s police and politicians without the slightest deference, as part of a
  system that was failing, practically and ethically, to address our era’s
  escalating crises. As the arrests went on and on, through the hot afternoon
  and into the evening, many of the protesters barely moved, but kept facing the
  same way, sitting on the ground with their placards carefully displayed and
  their backs to the Houses of Parliament. Partly, this was to provide a
  globally resonant image, but it was also to dramatise their rejection of the
  will of the Commons, where only 26 MPs voted against Palestine Action’s
  proscription last month. Parliament likes to see itself as a historic defender
  of freedom and liberty, yet when panics about subversive groups are under way,
  its liberalism often evaporates. While the Commons narrows its views in times
  of crisis, the electorate sometimes does the opposite. Half of those arrested
  in the square were aged 60 or older – usually the most politically
  conservative demographic. Many had had middle-class careers in public service.
  Chatting among themselves on the grass in the quieter moments between police
  surges, they could almost have been taking a break between events at a book
  festival. One woman sat on a camping stool, wearing a panama hat. When I
  introduced myself, she said: “I don’t like the Guardian, I read the
  Telegraph.” The last time Labour was in office, opposition to its more
  draconian and militaristic policies also emerged across the political
  spectrum. The more rightwing members of this opposition can be questioned: are
  they as outraged when Tory governments support wars or suspend civil
  liberties? My sense is not. But either way, broad opposition erodes a
  government’s legitimacy. At the 2005 election, after the Terrorism Act and the
  Iraq war, Blair still won, yet with almost a third fewer votes than when he
  came to power. With Labour more unpopular now, Starmer can less afford to
  alienate anti-war voters – much as his most illiberal subordinates might want
  to. Yet any electoral consequences from the scenes in Parliament Square, and
  from likely sequels, are hardly the only things at stake in the Palestine
  Action controversy. At mid-afternoon on Saturday, with the police cordon
  tightening around us, I got talking to two elderly protesters who had watched
  people being arrested beside them. “I’m in two minds about carrying on with
  this,” one of them said, opening and closing her piece of cardboard with its
  illegal message. Defiant earlier, she now seemed frightened. The legally safe
  space for protest in Britain is shrinking again. Meanwhile in Gaza, there’s no
  safe space for anything at all. Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist Do you
