  With several late-night hosts on holiday, Seth Meyers took a closer look at
  the Trump administration’s deployment of the national guard in Washington DC
  as a playbook for other cities. Seth Meyers “Donald Trump is always
  laser-focused on the important stuff – no, not inflation, not healthcare, not
  jobs,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday evening. “He’s focused on giving himself
  an award.” On Wednesday, Trump gave a typically rambling speech at the John F
  Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the formerly prestigious performance
  hall that he took over early in his term, purging the board and replacing it
  with loyalists. Presenting the center’s annual honorees, the president said:
  “I always wanted one, I was never able to get one … I would’ve taken it, if
  they would’ve called me. I waited, and waited, and waited, and then said, ‘To
  hell with it, I’ll become chairman and I’ll give myself an honor.’ Next year
  we’ll honor Trump, OK?” “I like how everyone laughs at him, and then he says,
  ‘No, it’s true, actually,’” the Late Night host responded. “Second, he’s
  definitely not joking about giving himself an award. This is the guy who made
  a fake Time magazine cover for himself to hang on his wall. “I have no trouble
  believing that he’d give himself a made-up award called the ‘Kennedy Center
  Lifetime Achievement Nobel Prize EGOT Award for Most Everything’,” Meyers
  added. Trump also announced that he would host the annual Kennedy Center
  Honors, and claimed he had to be talked into it by his team because he has
  better things to do as president. “Well, I think you deserve the award for
  best original screenplay, because that’s definitely a fake conversation that
  did not happen,” Meyers laughed. Meyers then turned to the other major
  political story this week: Trump taking over the Washington DC Metropolitan
  police and deploying the national guard to combat a made-up crime wave in the
  city. Meyers noted that Republicans see this action as a playbook for other
  cities, despite the fact that, in truth, violent crime rates are down in most
  major cities. The states with the highest crime rates, such as Louisiana and
  Mississippi, are largely controlled by Republicans. “The right has created
  this myth about crime in big cities that isn’t true,” Meyers said. “It’s a
  playbook that Republicans have used for decades, and Trump repeated it in
  2024. “In a clear sign that this is all just theater, Trump is threatening to
  only send the national guard to cities controlled by Democrats,” calling the
  DC action a “beacon for New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other places all
  over the country”. “The myth of urban crime is central to the right’s
  worldview,” Meyers noted. “For years, they basically made it their whole thing
  to be afraid of cities.” He pointed to the example of the US transportation
  secretary, Sean Duffy, on Fox News, complaining about crime rates on the New
  York City subway and also taking a shot at its cleanliness. Meyers got
  defensive. “Only New Yorkers are allowed to shit on the New York City subway.
  I mean that figuratively and sadly sometimes literally,” he said. “Trump
  doesn’t want to fix problems in big cities, because he loves problems in big
  cities,” he concluded. “He loves problems anywhere that can distract from his
  problems. And he definitely has problems – his polling numbers are not great,
  his Maga base is questioning his ties to Jeffrey Epstein and voters are
  starting to suspect that the Trump administration might be,” to quote Trump
  himself, “a crime pot.”
