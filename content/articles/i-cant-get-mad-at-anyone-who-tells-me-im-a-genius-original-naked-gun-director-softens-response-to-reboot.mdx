  David Zucker, who co-created the Police Squad! and Naked Gun franchises and
  directed the first two films starring Leslie Nielsen, has reacted to the warm
  critical reception and healthy box office takings of the reboot starring Liam
  Neeson. Zucker had previously expressed scepticism and even anger about the
  direction the new film appeared to be taking, and the decision by the studio
  not to include him in the process. But speaking to the Hollywood Reporter in
  the wake of strong ticket sales and robust reviews for the Akiva Schaffer
  reboot, Zucker appeared more conciliatory. “People are liking it, which is
  great,” he said. “I really like the director, and I just couldn’t wish him
  more well. I texted him already, saying, ‘I hear the reviews are great, and
  it’s tracking well.’ He was very happy to hear from me, and we’ll probably get
  together later in the month when the smoke clears.” He continued: “I’m excited
  about it because it just shows that there’s a strong market for comedy in
  movie theatres, and spoof in particular.” Last year, the director was less
  enthusiastic, saying of the reboot: “Paramount is just going ahead and doing
  it, they haven’t involved me. They’re just gonna do what they want, that’s
  Hollywood.” Zucker and the franchise’s other co-creators, including his
  brother Jerry Zucker, had previously pitched a fourth-instalment script
  focusing on the thirtysomething son of the main character Frank Drebin, but it
  was rejected by the studio. “We were not excited about having the franchise
  given to other people,” he continued. “They have not contacted me to make a
  cameo or be involved in the writing. Whether or not they’re going to do a good
  job with it, this kind of spoof, I mean it’s not rocket science, but it’s not
  easy.” Earlier this year, Zucker reiterated his disapproval, saying he was
  “not planning on seeing the Naked Gun remake”. “I regret having seen the
  trailer for it,” he continued, before comparing the promo to a 2007 Brazilian
  pornographic film. “It’s like watching 2 Girls 1 Cup. I can’t unsee it.”
  Despite his turnaround, Zucker reiterated his aversion to seeing the film to
  Hollywood Reporter, but said that the team behind it had reached out to him
  before its release. “I’m not gonna see it, but I don’t see any of the sequels
  that were of my material done by other people, and that’s fine. I’ve told
  Akiva that I have no intention to see it,” he said. “He actually invited me to
  come see an early cut of it, but I told him there’s nothing I could do to help
  because it really isn’t what I would have done. That’s not to say that he
  didn’t actually end up doing a good movie. But I don’t think I could help with
  that.” Zucker added that producer Seth MacFarlane had phoned him shortly after
  the new script had been completed. “He spent the first 10 minutes telling me
  how much he loved Airplane!, The Naked Gun and Top Secret!,” said Zucker. “I
  can’t get mad at anyone who will tell me what a genius I am. That was a good
  conversation. I was glad that Seth called, but I told him politely, ‘Good
  luck, but I can’t put my name on this.’ [But] everything happens for a
  reason.” The new Naked Gun film stars Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr, alongside
  Pamela Anderson and Danny Huston. In his four-star review, the Guardian’s
  Peter Bradshaw praised it as “amiably ridiculous, refreshingly shallow,
  entirely pointless and guilelessly crass”.
