  An adventure-loving local detective planning his retirement and a senior
  constable on temporary assignment in Victoria’s alpine region have been
  identified as the victims of a shooting in Porepunkah. Detective leading
  senior constable Neal Thompson, 59, and senior constable Vadim De Waart, 35,
  were on Wednesday named by police as the officers allegedly killed by Dezi
  Freeman on Tuesday morning. Police continued their search for Freeman on
  Wednesday, who was seen running into the bush alone immediately after the
  shooting. Police have described the search area as very wide, and said Freeman
  is “heavily armed” and “understands bushcraft well”. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email The two police officers had been part of a group of 10 police – made up
  of local officers and members of the sexual offences and child abuse
  investigation team – who entered a property in Porepunkah, in north-east
  Victoria, on Tuesday morning to serve a search warrant before allegedly being
  fired upon by Freeman. Another officer was also injured. Thompson joined
  Victoria police in 1987 and worked across several roles, including general
  duties at Collingwood station and on the major fraud and state crime squads.
  He took up his most recent post with the Wangaratta criminal investigation
  unit in July 2007. In a statement, police described Thompson as an “adventurer
  [who] enjoyed all things outdoors”, and who regularly took his friends and
  colleagues on trips with him. They said Thompson had found a “new purpose”
  with his partner, Lisa, who he was with for six years before his death and was
  “planning in earnest for his imminent retirement”. “Together with Lisa, Neal
  had built a new home and had a long list of tasks planned after he knocked off
  work for the last time,” police said. De Waart joined the force in December
  2018 and worked at St Kilda station for three years, before joining the public
  order response team in 2023. Police said he was on temporary assignment in
  Wangaratta at the time of his death. Described as an “eternal optimist and
  avid traveller”, De Waart was fluent in French, Spanish, Flemish and English
  and was a keen scuba diver, motorcyclist and gin collector. “[He] always
  picked up a local bottle on his overseas adventures for his large collection
  at home,” police said. “While travelling was his passion, Vadim was extremely
  proud to have purchased his first home in Melbourne in recent years.” He is
  survived by his parents, Carolina and Alain, who live in his native Belgium,
  and younger brother Sacha, who lives in Switzerland. His family in Melbourne
  includes his aunts, Jacqueline and Maria; uncles, Shane and Peter; and cousins
  Christopher, Jeremy, Laura and Tessa. The Victoria police chief commissioner,
  Mike Bush, said the loss of the two officers had “struck at the heart” of the
  force, the broader policing family and the community of Porepunkah. “In the
  coming days, weeks and months, we will all grieve this loss and deeply miss
  our colleagues and friends who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of
  duty,” Bush said. “It is not lost on me that our members take a risk every
  time they go to work to protect the Victorian community. While we all live
  with the knowledge that the worst could happen on a shift, we don’t expect it
  to.” Bush said he would visit the injured officer at the Alfred hospital on
  Wednesday. The man is in stable condition after surgery. Search continues for
  suspected gunman Earlier on Wednesday, Bush named Freeman, also known as
  Desmond Filby, 56, as the suspected gunman. Bush said there had been no
  confirmed sightings of Freeman, who once called police “terrorist thugs” and
  has a history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas,
  since the attack. “Sovereign citizens” or pseudolaw adherents often have a
  range of conspiratorial beliefs, including that a country’s laws have become
  illegitimate and the government is corrupted, leading them to reject its
  authority. He said police had not recovered any firearms from the property
  where the shooting took place, leading officers to believe Freeman had taken
  them all with him. “We believe he has longarms, powerful firearms, multiple
  firearms,” Bush said. Bush would not confirm reports Freeman may have also
  taken police firearms. He said police had set up a cordon around a “very wide
  search area” but conceded Freeman “understands bushcraft well”, which
  presented a “challenge”. “He knows that area. Even though we have experts in
  the area, he will know that area better than us, so we’re putting in every
  expert, supported by local knowledge as well,” Bush said. He said “anything’s
  possible” – including that Freeman had set up traps in the bushland, with
  officers “well briefed to be on the lookout”. Bush refused to provide further
  details about the nature of the warrant police had attempted to execute on
  Tuesday, out of respect for “victims involved”. He said 10 officers were
  required due to the “large area” the search warrant covered. “Part of
  executing a search warrant is searching. It’s a large area, so it required a
  large number of staff to search the area and also search for technology … that
  would provide evidence to the offences they were investigating,” he said. Bush
  said as the manhunt for Freeman continued police would remain at the crime
  scene and search other locations nearby. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,
  and the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, have led tributes to the officers
  killed. Allan said there were “huge resources” being put on the ground in
  north-east Victoria. New South Wales police have also offered support. “We
  continue to provide every support necessary to the work of Victoria police as
  they deal with this individual who perpetrated this most evil and awful of
  criminal act,” Allan said. “There is no doubt that this is a community that is
  feeling the enormity of how their beautiful country town yesterday – that
  peaceful, wonderful country lifestyle – was not just shattered, but was put
  into the most awful of spotlights possible.”
