  Israel’s military will no longer pause fighting to allow aid deliveries in
  Gaza City, a military spokesperson has said, in a decision likely to deepen
  the famine already gripping the north of the territory. Israeli forces have
  been stepping up attacks in and around Gaza City as the military prepares for
  a ground operation that humanitarian groups and many of Israel’s closest
  allies have warned will be catastrophic for hundreds of thousands of
  Palestinian civilians already struggling to survive hunger, disease and
  Israeli attacks. Gaza’s health ministry said on Friday that malnutrition had
  killed five people and Israeli strikes had killed 59 others over the previous
  24 hours. In a statement on X the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that
  the “local tactical pause” would no longer apply to Gaza City as of Friday
  morning. The whole city was now considered a “dangerous combat zone”, the
  military said, although Israel has not ordered civilians to evacuate. About
  80% of Gaza is under evacuation orders, with civilians crammed into just
  one-fifth of its total area. Even those areas are not safe, with Israeli
  attacks targeting parts it has labelled “humanitarian zones”. The Israeli
  military described the attacks now under way as the “initial stages” of a
  planned operation, although military chiefs are reportedly still arguing with
  the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about whether the military has the
  capacity to do what he has ordered after nearly two years of war. Also on
  Friday, the Israeli military announced it had recovered the remains of the
  55-year-old hostage Ilan Weiss and another unnamed hostage. Weiss was killed
  in the 7 October attack and his body was taken to Gaza. After international
  pressure over starvation in Gaza, Israel last month said it would pause
  fighting for a part of each day to allow more food convoys to reach
  communities across Gaza. Israel also slightly eased its blockade on aid
  shipments, but the new measures were only enough to slow the progress towards
  famine in Gaza City, not to reverse it. Israeli tanks have entered the city’s
  outskirts, and the once-upmarket Zeitoun neighbourhood has been razed to the
  ground in recent weeks. The military escalation comes even as mediators say
  Hamas has accepted a proposed part-ceasefire deal now on the table, with terms
  that Israel has previously agreed. Polling also shows that most Israelis back
  ending the war in return for the release of hostages, and there is fierce
  domestic criticism of the planned operation from many, who warn it will
  endanger those hostages who are still alive and take a heavy toll on exhausted
  soldiers. But a ceasefire would threaten Netanyahu’s fragile coalition,
  because far-right partners say they will leave if the fighting stops. The
  prime minister says the operation to take full military control of Gaza City
  is needed in order to defeat Hamas. Israel’s military spokesperson previously
  said the looming operation meant that the forced displacement of all
  Palestinians in Gaza City, which now houses about half of Gaza’s population,
  was “inevitable”. About 23,000 Palestinians had already evacuated Gaza City
  over the past week, the UN said on Thursday, as people fled in anticipation of
  a renewed offensive. But many have refused to leave. There is little space for
  more people in the small portions of south Gaza not under an evacuation order,
  and many people have been killed while en route to supposed safe zones or once
  already there. Extreme hunger also means many in Gaza City would struggle to
  make the journey on foot. There are very few vehicles, or even animals, for
  transport. Aid groups said they had not been given prior notice of Israel’s
  announcement on Friday, while Gaza’s health ministry said it did not have the
  resources to serve the entire population if everyone in the city were forced
  south. Israel’s announcement triggered outrage from European countries, with
  the foreign ministers of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia and
  Spain condemning the offensive and plans to establish a permanent presence in
  Gaza City. The Holy Family Church of Gaza City told the Associated Press on
  Friday that the approximately 440 people sheltering in the church and the
  clergy would not be leaving. Earlier in the week, religious authorities in
  Gaza said fleeing would be a “death sentence” for many of the weak and
  malnourished people sheltering in churches. As the IDF said it was gearing up
  for the offensive, the military was struggling to mobilise soldiers. According
  to Israeli Army News, the army has halved the amount of training time given to
  new reservists assigned to drive tanks. High-ranking officers complained that
  this would not be enough time to properly train new soldiers. On Friday, the
  attorney general’s office discussed whether or not the government had the
  authority to catch draft dodgers at Israel’s border crossings. Despite the
  growing pressure abroad and at home, Israeli officials have not engaged with
  the latest Hamas proposal for a ceasefire. The US envoy Steve Witkoff said he
  expected the war to end by the end of the year, far past the timetable within
  which the Gaza City offensive is supposed to take place. More than 63,000
  Palestinians have been killed over the last 23 months in Gaza, the majority of
  them civilians, according to health authorities. Israel attacked Gaza after
  Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages in an
  attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.
