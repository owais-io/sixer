  The flow of new rental properties coming on to the market has fallen at the
  fastest rate since the first Covid lockdown five years ago, according to
  research by Britain’s property surveyors. Although the demand for properties
  is steady, there are fewer new rentals from landlords coming available, the
  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found. The July 2025 Rics
  Residential Market Survey showed a “firmly negative trend” in landlords making
  their properties available for rent, the weakest reading since April 2020.
  With the lack of fresh supply in the pipeline, rental prices are expected to
  rise over the next three months, according to the report, which takes a
  monthly “sentiment survey” of chartered surveyors. The expected rise comes
  after another report this week found the average private rents in Great
  Britain had fallen marginally for the first time in five years. The estate
  agent Hamptons said lower mortgage rates had helped to take some heat out of
  the market and that the average rent on a newly let property fell by 0.2% in
  July compared with a year earlier. The Rics report also said new inquiries
  from homebuyers had fallen in July, suggesting a softening in demand compared
  with earlier in the summer. In June, most of those surveyed said there had
  been a rise in fresh inquiries. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said
  the flatter tone of the latest report showed the market was facing challenges.
  Last week, the Bank of England voted for a fifth cut in interest rates in a
  year, reducing the cost of borrowing to 4% amid concerns about the strength of
  the UK economy. “Although interest rates were lowered at the latest Bank of
  England meeting, the split vote has raised doubts about both the timing and
  extent of further reductions,” Rubinsohn said. “Meanwhile, uncertainty about
  the potential contents of the chancellor’s autumn budget is also raising some
  concerns. Against this backdrop, respondents continue to report that the
  market remains particularly price sensitive at the present time.” The estate
  agent Knight Frank said the renters’ rights bill, which is due to come into
  force next year and is aimed at reforming the sector, has meant landlords were
  now increasingly looking to sell. “[Shrinking supply] is one unintended
  consequence of the forthcoming renters’ rights bill, which could make it more
  onerous to regain possession of a property and raises the risk of void
  periods,” said Tom Bill, head of residential research. Sarah Coles, head of
  personal finance at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Rics
  survey showed “the era of runaway rents isn’t over yet” as more people were
  now chasing fewer homes. One of its recent surveys found that the average
  renting household had just £62 left at the end of the month.
