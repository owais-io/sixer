  pastoral idyll

  Mike Bartlett’s striking three-act play is a curiously changing thing. It
  begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash
  bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing
  into what might be a state-of-the-nation play and entering into similar ground
  to Bartlett’s brilliant Albion in its portrait of middle-class urbanites who
  have upped sticks for an alternative, “better” rural existence through
  sustainable farming. It grows into something bigger and more universal still,
  to become a play about how to live responsibly in the midst of toxic
  capitalism. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is
  localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new
  pastoral idyll? Important questions are asked through the prism of a family
  headed up by Ruth (Hattie Morahan), her shaggy, laconic partner, Lip (Sam
  Troughton) and Ruth’s former stepdaughter, Milly (Nadia Parkes). Lip is
  ecowarrior and would-be guru in the mould of Jez Butterworth’s Rooster,
  although more privileged – his farm is a family inheritance – and not nearly
  as charismatic. Ruth shares his dream of getting back to a kinder, more
  elemental way of living – up to a point. Under the direction of James
  Macdonald, the lights do not dip. This draws our eye to the vivid daylight on
  Lip’s fields, and maybe also the idea that this story about ethical ways of
  living is of our world, and we are part of it. The set designed by Ultz (who
  also designed that of Jerusalem) is a grassy bank. It is a living, breathing
  thing, it seems, with birdsong, tufts of grass that occasionally tumble down
  and – less welcome – a small, strange insect found in this critic’s bra. The
  cast give excellent performances and the action is intriguing, the arguments
  holding us, but the story in itself seems contrived around the play’s ideas.
  Sometimes these announce themselves in the mouths of characters, especially
  Milly’s friend, Femi (Terique Jarrett). He is doing an MSc in contemporary
  rural economy at Oxford, we are told. He certainly sounds as if he is by the
  third act when he lectures Lip (and us?) on everything from Gen X legacies
  from Thatcher’s Britain to the economics of global capitalism. Lip, too, seems
  like an anti-Enlightenment construct – a luddite who puts his principles above
  life-saving modern medicine. There is plenty that captures current-day
  anxieties too around technology, globalisation and the disenchantment of
  preppers and survivalists. Vitally, it is thoroughly amusing, alongside the
  serious stuff. Milly is full of beady-eyed Gen Z attitude without becoming a
  caricature. Tony (Jonathan Slinger), the farmer next door who is trying to
  rejuvenate himself in his mid-life (crisis?) is simultaneously satirised and
  heartfelt. Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling
  and ambitious, Chekhovian in glimmers. Bartlett masterfully weds levity
  through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter. And there
  is something courageous in its biting off more than it can chew. It is not so
  much a state-of-the-nation play as a state-of-the-world drama, grappling with
  the very real and prevailing despair over how to live, fix the climate crisis,
  and find collective hope. Invigorating and welcome, except, of course, for the
  rogue insect. • At Donmar Warehouse, London, until 4 October
