  Even as daylight began to fade on Tuesday evening across the vast Cincinnati
  Open tournament grounds and the other courts emptied, Emma Raducanu was not
  yet ready to end her workday. The start of competition in Mason, Ohio also
  marked her first day of training with her new coach Francisco Roig. She was
  determined to make the most of it. Having already trained in the afternoon,
  Raducanu and Roig spent the evening working quietly through each shot in her
  game. Alongside ample technical conversations about her groundstrokes and
  second serve, there was also plenty of laughter as the pair began the task of
  learning more about each other and how their personalities match. Only a
  furious evening downpour forced them off the court. While many of Raducanu’s
  numerous coaching changes have come during difficult moments in her career,
  this is rather a hopeful occasion. This tournament is something of a milestone
  for Raducanu, who has earned a seeding of No 30 in a reflection of the
  consistent training and match wins that have allowed her to rebuild her
  ranking over the past few months. Now No 27 in the WTA Race with few points to
  defend until the end of the year, she has a great opportunity to finish even
  higher and make an impression at the US Open later this month. As she has
  built confidence in her game, Raducanu has performed well against mid-ranked
  players, but it is also clear the current iteration of her game has a ceiling.
  She has consistently looked underpowered against the biggest shotmakers and
  she is not quite quick enough to frustrate them with her defensive
  capabilities. After following up her semi-final run in Washington with two
  wins in Montreal, this was further reinforced by her 6-2, 6-1 defeat against
  the recent Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova in the third round last week.
  The challenge for Raducanu and Roig over the coming months will be to see how
  she can use her abilities to test the best players in the world. Her
  tournament will begin on Saturday afternoon with a tough match against Olga
  Danilovic of Serbia, who scuppered a potential all-British second-round match
  by defeating a struggling Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5 on Thursday. Should Raducanu
  win, she could face the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, in the third round on
  Monday. With so many top players opting out of the first weeks of the US
  hard-court swing, Cincinnati marks a significant moment in the buildup to the
  US Open as many of the main contenders attempt to build their form for the
  final grand slam tournament of the year. While Sabalenka is competing for the
  first time since a brief mid-season break, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz
  will also return to competition for the first time since their Wimbledon final
  last month. After 18-year-old Victoria Mboko’s incredible triumph in Toronto
  on Thursday night, she and the beaten finalist, Naomi Osaka, have already
  withdrawn from Cincinnati. Elsewhere, Sonay Kartal struggled in her first
  match since her run to the Wimbledon fourth round last month, losing 5-7, 6-4,
  6-3 to Caroline Garcia early on Friday. Although Garcia, a former world No 4
  and the 2022 champion in Cincinnati, is a player with significant pedigree,
  this was a disappointing performance from Kartal, who struck just winners and
  44 unforced errors against an opponent who is retiring from professional
  tennis in the coming months.
