  More than 200 industry lobbyists are attending the UN’s meeting to hammer out
  a global plastics treaty, raising fears that moves to prevent runaway plastic
  production may be undermined. The 234 lobbyists from the oil, petrochemical
  and plastics industries outnumber the combined delegations of all 27 EU member
  states, and far exceed the number of people attending with the delegation of
  scientists as well as Indigenous peoples at the Geneva talks. The analysis,
  from the Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel), also found 19
  lobbyists sit on the national delegations of Egypt, Kazakhstan, China, Iran,
  Chile and the Dominican Republic. “Fossil fuel companies are central to
  plastic production, as over 99% of plastics are derived from chemicals sourced
  from fossil fuels,” said Ximena Banegas, Ciel’s global plastics and
  petrochemicals campaigner. “After decades of obstruction in the climate
  negotiations, why would anyone think that they would suddenly show up in good
  faith in the plastics treaty talks?” The figure was revealed on day three of a
  two-week resumed meeting to achieve an agreement on the vast global problem of
  runaway plastic production and waste. The numbers of lobbyists attending the
  talks has been rising steadily since the process started in 2022, alongside
  deepening rifts between nations. Negotiations stalled at what was supposed to
  be the fifth and final round of talks in Busan, South Korea, in December last
  year. The process was extended to the current round in Switzerland to give
  nations another chance to agree on a deal. Tensions have flared around key
  aspects of the proposed treaty, including calls for a production limit on
  plastics, managing harmful chemicals in plastics, and how the treaty’s
  implementation will be financed, with countries splitting into increasingly
  divergent camps. On the one hand is a cohort of more than 100 nations that say
  they want an ambitious treaty including, among other things, global targets to
  reduce plastic production. On the other is a small group of oil and
  plastic-producing states including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran – the
  so-called “like-minded group” – that reject production limits and want the
  treaty to focus on downstream measures to tackle waste. Three days into
  negotiations, these separate camps seem to be further entrenched, with the
  United States appearing to side with the industry-friendly “like-minded
  group”. “They’re basically going full Maga,” said a source close to the talks.
  “They’re clearly coordinating with Saudi Arabia, Russia and others, because
  they’re using the same language.” Before the meeting in Geneva, the US
  reportedly circulated a memo among countries where it openly took a stance
  against production cuts. The US is the world’s second-largest plastic producer
  and yet last year said it supported production cuts. The source also noted
  that the US delegation usually met environmental NGOs, scientists and industry
  before the talks begin, but that before the Geneva meeting they had met with
  industry alone. “Even under a Democratic administration, the US is incredibly
  industry-friendly, but it at least goes through the motions of consulting with
  its own citizenry,” they said. “That charade is gone now.” Two days before
  Ciel’s estimate was released, the International Council of Chemical
  Associations (ICCA), an industry trade body, released their own statement
  saying that they had 136 representatives of the plastic, petrochemical and
  chemical manufacturing industries present at the talks. Referring to their
  headcount, an ICCA spokesperson said: “We are significantly outnumbered by the
  more than 1,500 NGO participants.” However, civil society groups say this is a
  false comparison, as lobbyists have comparatively more power at the talks.
  Ciel’s analysis shows several lobbyists appear on government delegations from
  where they can actively sculpt the treaty text. Their impact is also felt on
  the outside, as even the lobbyists who attend only as negotiation observers –
  a group that includes industry representatives, civil society organisations
  and scientists – have “privileged access” to delegates, for example, through
  industry-sponsored unofficial side events that are common in the margins of
  the talks. Jo Banner, who is part of the US civil society environmental
  justice delegation, and lives in Louisiana’s petrochemical industry hub known
  as “Cancer Alley”, highlights the disconnect between the lobbying work that
  industry representatives will do in Geneva and the harms that this ultimately
  leads to on the ground. “This is just a job for them. This is about their
  401(k)s and their retirement plans. It’s life or death for us and I don’t want
  my obituary to be part of their resumé. We’re here fighting to protect our
  communities. It’s beyond being a job for us.” Last week, Greenpeace released a
  report showing that seven petrochemical majors – including Dow, ExxonMobil and
  Shell – have collectively increased their plastic production capacity by 1.4m
  tonnes since the start of the treaty-making process and have sent a combined
  total of 70 representatives to the talks. Another factor that may have an
  effect on the ongoing negotiations is the death in a helicopter accident of
  the Ghanaian environment minister, Dr Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, who was due at
  the meeting alongside more than 70 government ministers next week. Ghana is
  the chair of the African Group, a 52-nation bloc that has favoured an
  ambitious treaty from the beginning. If the talks go according to schedule, an
  agreement should be reached by 14 August.
