  The Harvard University president, Alan Garber, has told faculty a deal between
  the Ivy League institution and the Trump administration is not imminent – and
  denied reports that the university is considering a $500m settlement with the
  White House, Harvard’s student newspaper the Crimson reported. The Crimson
  attributed that information to three unnamed faculty members in a report
  published early on Monday. According to the publication, Garber said Harvard
  was seeking to resolve its dispute with the Trump administration through the
  court system. Negotiations between the Trump administration and Harvard
  reopened in June after the president halted billions in federal funding to the
  university. That came before Columbia University in July reached a $221m
  settlement with the Trump administration to restore federal funding that was
  frozen amid allegations that certain universities across the US were not doing
  enough to combat antisemitism. Harvard University said on 29 July that it was
  complying with Trump administration demands to turn over employment forms for
  thousands of university staff. But the university said it would not share
  records of employees in student-only roles. The New York Times reported
  Harvard was open to spending up to $500m to resolve its dispute with the Trump
  administration. A faculty member reportedly told the Crimson that Garber
  denied it was true Harvard was open to spending that much – and he added that
  claim was leaked to the Times by the White House. The New York Times told the
  Crimson it stood by its reporting. “A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment
  but disputed the characterization of Garber’s remarks after publication,” the
  Crimson reported. “Harvard officials, including Garber, have consistently
  maintained that they will not agree to any deal that threatens the
  university’s academic freedom. But it remains unclear exactly what Garber sees
  as essential.” The Crimson noted Harvard had already taken steps to try to
  appease the Trump administration by eliminating its diversity offices, cutting
  ties to a Palestinian university, following through on a commitment to
  establishing ties with Israeli universities, and centralizing disciplinary
  powers under Garber. Harvard is currently in court against the Trump
  administration, fighting federal attempts to end international student
  enrollment at the university and challenging the federal freeze on research
  funds. A judge has issued preliminary injunctions in the university’s lawsuit
  challenging the international student enrollment ban, and a judge appeared
  skeptical of the Trump administration’s arguments for freezing federal
  research funds, though Trump has vowed to appeal any victories in court by
  Harvard. Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the
  Guardian.
