  Tottenham have agreed to sign João Palhinha on a season’s loan from Bayern
  Munich, with the deal for the Portugal midfielder including an option to make
  his move permanent for £27m. It is understood that Spurs are paying a loan fee
  of £4.3m and will also cover the whole of Palhinha’s wages, with the
  30-year-old expected to complete his medical in the coming days. Tottenham had
  initially approached Bayern about a straight loan for Palhinha, who joined the
  German side from Fulham last summer in a deal worth up to £47.4m, as Thomas
  Frank looks to add extra options in central midfield. But it is understood
  that Bayern requested the option to make the move permanent at the end of the
  season for €30m (£27m) be added during negotiations this week and that was
  accepted. Palhinha has three years remaining on his current contract but is
  believed to have been keen to return to the Premier League after enjoying two
  successful seasons in west London. He only made six starts in the Bundesliga
  under Vincent Kompany. Tottenham’s board have a good relationship with their
  Bayern counterparts, having signed Mathys Tel this summer for around £30m
  after the French forward spent the second half of last season on loan in north
  London, as well as agreeing previous deals for Harry Kane and Eric Dier. Spurs
  are understood to be targeting a new left-back and have been linked with
  Fulham’s Antonee Robinson, while they are also hoping to sign another
  attacking midfielder after failing in their pursuit of Nottingham Forest’s
  Morgan Gibbs-White. Meanwhile, the teenage forward Mikey Moore has completed
  his season-long loan move to Rangers in a deal that is understood to not
  include an option to make the switch permanent. The highly rated attacker, who
  turns 18 this month, came through the ranks at Spurs and made his senior debut
  against Manchester City a little over 12 months ago, becoming the youngest
  Tottenham player to feature in the Premier League at the age of 16 years and
  277 days. Moore, who has played for England youth sides up to under-19 level,
  told the Ibrox club’s official website: “I’m excited to get going. As soon as
  I heard Rangers were interested and wanted me to come, it was a massive
  opportunity for me.”
