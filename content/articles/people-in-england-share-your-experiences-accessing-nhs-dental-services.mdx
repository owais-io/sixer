  People living in deprived or rural communities are more likely to experience
  “dental deserts” with a lack of NHS dental services, according to analysis of
  NHS England data from the Local Government Association. For instance,
  Middlesborough, one of the most deprived local authorities in England, has
  just 10 NHS dental practices per 100,000 people, compared to Richmond upon
  Thames, among the least deprived, which has 28 per 100,000. We would like to
  hear from people in England about their experiences of accessing NHS dental
  services for themselves or their children. Were you able to find somewhere
  locally or do you have to travel further afield? How easy have you found it to
  access care? We’re also interested in hearing from those who have had hospital
  tooth extractions recently.
