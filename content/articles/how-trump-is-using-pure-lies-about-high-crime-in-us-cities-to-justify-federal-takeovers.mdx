  When Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the Metropolitan police
  department in Washington DC on Monday, he left room for the possibility of
  making a similar move in other cities across the US, alluding to their high
  crime rates. “You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how
  bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad,” Trump said. “We’re not
  going to let it happen, we’re not going to lose our cities.” But both experts
  and elected officials have been quick to counter Trump’s claims, pointing out
  how major cities are in fact experiencing dramatic decreases in violent crime
  rates since they peaked during the pandemic. “Every category of crime and
  every population group that the FBI covers is reporting a drop pretty much
  nationwide,” said Jeff Asher, an analyst who studies criminal justice data,
  adding that there was no disparity in the trend between red and blue cities or
  states. The downward trend has been consistent nationally since around 2022,
  as the country began to recover from the pandemic, experts said. “It’s clear
  that a lot of what we saw during the Covid-19 era has been reversed,” said
  Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who researches
  crime trends. While it’s impossible to isolate the exact causes of the spike
  in crime during the pandemic, several experts point to the collapse of social
  services as one cause. Since then, state and federal agencies poured money
  into communities for projects like gun violence prevention programs as well as
  more streetlights on local roads. These programs are the same ones being
  slashed as the Trump administration has prioritized shrinking federal
  spending. The Department of Justice canceled hundreds of grants earlier this
  year that funded violence prevention and victims’ services programs, affecting
  organizations in 37 states. Elected officials were quick to slam Trump for
  floating a possible federal takeover of police in their cities, citing local
  data that matched the same trend in the FBI data showing public safety
  improvements as well as pointing out the recent funding cuts. In Chicago,
  Mayor Brandon Johnson said shootings were down by 40% in the last year alone.
  “If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by
  releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our
  work to drive down crime and violence. Sending in the national guard would
  only serve to destabilize our city and undermine our public safety efforts,”
  he said. And in Maryland, local and state officials released a joint statement
  similarly criticizing the president for painting a false narrative about where
  they lived and worked. “As leaders in Baltimore and the state of Maryland, we
  stand in strong opposition to the president’s latest power grab, which is
  based on pure lies about our communities,” the statement said. Officials
  pointed to a 40% drop in violent crime since 2021 and said that progress was
  being made on public safety issues, despite the challenge of facing the Trump
  administration’s funding cuts. Instead of calling in the national guard, Trump
  should be looking to partner with local officials, they said. “We know from
  experience how to improve public safety: empower our community partners and
  violence interrupters, invest in our young people and prosecute repeat violent
  offenders in collaboration with law enforcement,” the statement said. In New
  York, officials also pushed back fast on Trump’s rhetoric. “New York is moving
  in the right direction in public safety,” the mayor, Eric Adams, said on
  Tuesday. While he added that he would be happy to accept more federal support,
  he added: “We don’t need anyone to come in and take over our law enforcement
  apparatus, we have the finest police department in the globe.” Even Trump’s
  FBI director, Kash Patel, said on Joe Rogan’s podcast in June that murder
  rates were on track to reach a historic low this year. “If we, the FBI and our
  government partners, achieve the mission, we’ll give the American people the
  lowest murder rate in decades,” he said. While crime rates are trending in the
  right direction, there’s still work to do to improve public safety concerns,
  said Rachel Eisenberg, the managing director for rights and justice at the
  Center for American Progress. But, she said, communities are still best
  positioned to address these challenges rather than federal troops, echoing the
  concerns of local officials. “What Trump is doing now is not about public
  safety,” she said. “It’s political theater.” Trump doubled down on his claims
  on Wednesday, suggesting that the crime statistics are a fraud, without
  specifying which statistics. “Crime is the worst it’s ever been,” he said. As
  national guard troops arrived in Washington DC this week, Thaddeus Johnson, a
  senior researcher at the Council on Criminal Justice, said that in the short
  term, it is likely arrests will go up. “That can really capture the psyche of
  people and people can be sensationalized as it really plays on the fears of
  people,” Johnson said. Ultimately, he said, it’s critical to address
  socioeconomic factors such as access to housing, unemployment rates and income
  inequity in order to improve public safety. “Putting the feds in is not going
  to be the long-term answer,” Johnson said. Meanwhile, Trump has already
  declared his policy move a victory. “People are feeling safe already,” he said
  on Wednesday. “They’re not afraid any more.”
