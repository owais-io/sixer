  Arne Slot has said the sympathy he feels for Eddie Howe over the Alexander
  Isak affair is limited by the fact the Liverpool transfer target is not the
  only talented forward available to the Newcastle manager. Slot revealed Howe
  is the one Premier League manager he has texted during his Liverpool reign and
  believes the 47-year-old will eventually coach England. Friendly overtures,
  however, may not be reciprocated when Liverpool visit St James’ Park on Monday
  evening. Isak will be conspicuous by his absence from Newcastle’s first home
  game of the season, having in effect downed tools in an attempt to force a
  British record transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have
  contributed to a trying summer for Newcastle, turning Isak’s head while also
  signing his potential replacement, Hugo Ekitiké. Their £110m offer for the
  Sweden international remains on Newcastle’s table. Slot expects an “intense”
  night at St James’ and, although Liverpool’s pursuit of Isak is strictly
  business, he recognises the effect a player going on strike will have had on
  his opposite number. “In general I have sympathy for Eddie Howe because he is
  a great human being,” said the Dutchman. “It’s maybe not a coincidence that
  I’ve texted with him because I think he’s a very nice, honest and polite
  colleague. “For the rest, I don’t need to have sympathy for a manager that can
  still have the availability of Gordon, Murphy, Elanga, Barnes … You don’t need
  to have sympathy for a manager who has so many good players in his squad. But,
  in general, I like him and I don’t think it will be a surprise to anyone if
  eventually he is going to lead the national team of England.” Slot and Howe
  exchanged messages after the Carabao Cup final in March, when Isak scored the
  decisive second goal to secure Newcastle’s first domestic trophy for 70 years
  at Liverpool’s expense. “The only [Premier League] manager I’ve ever texted
  with was Eddie Howe,” said Slot. “In Holland I texted with a few more. I don’t
  think it is good for me to say what he texted me or what I texted him. “They
  fully deserved to win the League Cup final. I didn’t text him something
  different. If I see him [on Monday] I will be the same as I was last season
  and I expect nothing different from him as well.” Relations may have been
  strained between Howe and key figures at Anfield by the transfer saga. Richard
  Hughes, the Liverpool sporting director who submitted the bid for Isak, has
  been close friends with Howe since they shared a flat during their playing
  days at Bournemouth. Howe has been friends with Michael Edwards, chief
  executive of football at Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owner, since they
  played for Portsmouth in the early 2000s. Edwards worked for Portsmouth at the
  time as a Prozone analyst. Slot, returning to the theme of Howe’s predicament,
  said: “Do you feel sympathy? To a certain extent because I like him as a
  manager and as a person. It’s not like we are friends and we are going to go
  on holiday together. You are asking me these questions because of Isak, of
  course. I added to that by saying we exchanged messages, the only manager I’ve
  exchanged messages with in the Premier League until now. I do speak to other
  managers after games. Maybe there’s a reason for that because my sports
  director has his number. Maybe he doesn’t have all the numbers of all the
  other managers.” What Slot does know is that when he looked at Liverpool’s
  bench after Bournemouth made it 2-2 at Anfield in the Premier League’s opening
  game, his only striking options were Federico Chiesa and 16-year-old Rio
  Ngumoha. Chiesa delivered in the opening Premier League fixture with an
  88th-minute winner, but purely in terms of numbers compared with last season
  Liverpool’s need for another forward option is clear after the sales of Luis
  Díaz and Darwin Núñez, and the death of Diogo Jota. “It depends how you want
  to look at it,” said Slot. “If you see Florian Wirtz as an attacking option as
  well, you can make it five [forwards available]. Yes we’ve sold Darwin, we’ve
  brought in Hugo, Luis is gone, but maybe you can see Florian as his
  replacement. Then you have Jeremie Frimpong who, when he is fit, is definitely
  an option to play as a winger as well. So then we end up at six. We have six
  players who can play in three positions. “I would consider Florian in more
  games for that position. There were games last season – [Manchester] City away
  and Villa away – where we did play with an extra midfielder, I think Curtis
  Jones. It depends not only on being an extra midfielder, but also the tactics
  and how the opposition line up.” And how the transfer saga of the summer pans
  out over the next few days.
