  Good morning. Donald Trump has said he plans to ask Congress for “long-term”
  control of Washington DC’s police department and signaled that he expects
  other US cities to change their laws in response to his deployment of national
  guard troops and federal agents into the capital. In an unprecedented move,
  Trump this week invoked a clause that allows a 30-day federal takeover of the
  police department, but will need Congress’s permission to extend it beyond
  this timeframe. Despite Congress being out of session, the president said he
  expected to propose the legislation “very quickly”, before alluding to other
  plans to secure the extension, saying: “If it’s a national emergency, we can
  do it without Congress”. “We’re going to go for statutes in DC and then
  ultimately for the rest of the country, where that’s not going to be allowed,”
  Trump said, singling out Democrat-led cities such as New York, Chicago and Los
  Angeles. Why the takeover? The administration argues it’s necessary to fight
  what Trump has called an “out of control” crime problem – a crisis that the
  city’s leaders say does not exist. More on that below. Putin faces ‘very
  severe consequences’ if no Ukraine truce agreed, Trump says Vladimir Putin
  will face “very severe consequences” unless he agrees to a ceasefire in the
  war in Ukraine when he meets Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, the president
  has said. Trump said that if the summit went well, he would push for a second
  meeting that would include the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
  adding that he “would like to do it almost immediately” but giving no concrete
  timeframe. He made the comments after a call with Zelenksyy and other European
  leaders, in which he reassured them that a truce was his priority and he would
  not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement. What are
  European leaders calling for? The UK, France and Germany have repeatedly said
  negotiations can begin in earnest only with a ceasefire in place. They called
  for Russia to face further sanctions if it does not agree to a truce at the
  summit. Over 115 scholars condemn cancellation of Harvard journal issue on
  Palestine More than 115 scholars have condemned the cancellation of an entire
  issue of a prestigious academic journal dedicated to Palestine by a Harvard
  University publisher as “censorship”. In an open letter published Thursday,
  they condemned the sudden cancellation of a special issue of the Harvard
  Educational Review – which was first revealed by the Guardian in July – as an
  “attempt to silence the academic examination of the genocide, starvation and
  dehumanisation of Palestinian people by the state of Israel and its allies”.
  Why was it canceled? The journal’s publisher acknowledged to editors that it
  was seeking legal reviews out of concern that the publication would trigger
  antisemitism claims, according to an editor. In other news … Donald Trump has
  signed an executive order that aims to downgrade environmental rules for
  commercial spaceship companies, in a move that appears to benefit Elon Musk
  and Jeff Bezos. The father of a New Zealand woman who has been detained by US
  immigration authorities for three weeks with her six-year-old son is hopeful
  they will be freed this week. Israeli strikes on a Tehran prison in June
  killed scores of inmates, visitors and staff in what Human Rights Watch (HRW)
  has labeled an “apparent war crime”. Stat of the day: Agricultural production
  will need to grow by about 50% by 2050 to feed population In order to feed a
  growing human population, agricultural output will need to rise by 50% in the
  next 25 years, the journalist Michael Grunwald estimates in his new book, We
  Are Eating the Earth. Doing this without wiping out biodiversity and ramping
  up global heating will be a momentous challenge. “Feeding the world without
  frying it” looks to be even tougher than ending the age of fossil fuels,
  Grunwald argues. Don’t miss this: Trump’s DC takeover harkens back to a dark
  incident 33 years ago – when crime was far worse In 1992, the death of a
  staffer for Senator Richard Shelby led the senator to introduce legislation to
  legalize the death penalty. The incident has similar qualities to the events
  leading up to Donald Trump’s decision to take over Washington DC and deploy
  the national guard, after a Doge staffer was assaulted. But there’s a big
  difference between DC then and now. Violent crime is at a 30-year low: in
  1991, DC recorded 482 murders, earning it infamy as the US’s murder capital.
  By contrast, there were 187 homicides in 2024 and the city looks set to record
  a lower number this year. Fred Frommer examines the period in the district’s
  history. Climate check: Deadly Nordic heatwave supercharged by climate crisis,
  scientists say “No country is safe from climate change”, scientists have
  warned after Nordic countries endured a dangerous heatwave in July. Despite
  their typically cool climates, Norway, Sweden and Finland were hit with
  soaring temperatures last month, including a record run of 22 days above 86C
  in Finland. In 2018, during the region’s last major heatwave, 750 people died
  prematurely in Sweden alone, and scientists expect to see a similar toll once
  the data is processed. Last Thing: Driven by ‘nonsensical dream logic’, And
  Just Like That rewrote the rules of TV After three bizarre seasons, And Just
  Like That says it is finally wrapping up. The critically panned Sex and the
  City’s spin-off was characterized by incoherence, with some viewers wondering
  if it had secretly been written by artificial intelligence. Despite
  functioning more like “content” than TV, Lara Williams admits she was drawn to
  its anaesthetizing lull: “And when it comes back, as I’m almost certain it
  will, I will feel much the same about it as Donald Trump does about Coca-Cola:
  I’ll still keep drinking that garbage.” Sign up First Thing is delivered to
