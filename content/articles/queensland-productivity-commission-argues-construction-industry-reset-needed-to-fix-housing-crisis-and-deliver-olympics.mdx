  Queensland’s Productivity Commission has flagged a broad construction industry
  “reset” that could threaten existing enterprise bargaining agreements, arguing
  it may be required if the state is to build its way out of a housing crisis –
  and host the Olympics. The commission released an interim report on Thursday
  into improving productivity in the construction sector that called on the
  Queensland government to permanently remove so-called “Best Practice Industry
  Conditions” (BPICs) from its procurement policy. Adopted under the previous
  Labor government in 2018, BPICs outlined construction union workers’ pay and
  conditions for all major state projects. Union proponents claim BPICs improved
  safety and lifted standards and created apprenticeship opportunities for women
  and Indigenous workers – industry opponents complained it led to cost blowouts
  and worksite shutdowns. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Liberal National
  party deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, hit pause on BPICs in November until the
  re-established Productivity Commission completed its building industry review.
  But the interim recommendations of that review go beyond a call to permanently
  scrap BPICs – arguing “a broader industry reset” was required if Queensland
  was to “meet the needs of its growing population, match infrastructure
  commitments and deliver the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games”. The report
  cited industry stakeholders as blaming BPICs for a “a significant slowdown in
  site productivity on public construction” workplaces that had enabled similar
  conditions to “creep into the private sector through the rollout of BPICs-like
  conditions in [EBAs)]”. “Removing BPICs alone is unlikely to be sufficient to
  shift construction productivity to a growth path or improve behaviours on
  government construction sites,” the commission wrote. “Given that BPIC-like
  conditions now seem to be embedded in industry practice, including in
  enterprise bargaining agreements that are not due to be re-negotiated until
  mid-2027, it is likely that a broader industry reset is required.” Asked at a
  press conference after the release of the interim report if the LNP would
  permanently scrap BPICs, the treasurer, David Janetzki, said he would wait for
  the final report before making any announcements. However, the treasurer said
  that declining productivity “cannot be tolerated”. The Queensland Council of
  Unions denies that BPICs affected worksite productivity. In May it released a
  report it commissioned from University of Queensland emeritus professor of
  economics John Mangan that found post-Covid cost increases were primarily
  driven by global supply chain constraints and material shortages – not labour
  agreements or public procurement standards. The QCU general secretary,
  Jacqueline King, said at the time that BPICs “did not drive up costs or damage
  productivity” but improved safety, lifted standards and created real
  opportunities for apprentices, women and Indigenous workers. King said the
  commission’s interim report “missed the boat on the most important thing of
  all: people”. The union secretary said “any serious conversation about lifting
  productivity” in the construction industry had to start with fixing what she
  said was a “crisis in building and retaining a Queensland workforce”. “There’s
  no shortage of Queenslanders willing to work in construction but this is an
  industry stuck in the 1970s, with 55-hour weeks, inflexible work arrangements
  and poor workplace cultures driving people away,” King said. “If we are
  serious about addressing the skills shortage and building the housing and
  infrastructure we need for our ever growing population in the lead-up to 2032
  and beyond, we need to focus on how to attract a homegrown labour force
  instead of migrant workers.” The peak national body for construction and
  infrastructure contracting companies backed the interim report as supporting
  “many of the reforms the industry has long been calling for”, including
  scrapping BPICs. “Queensland has a once-in-a-generation infrastructure task
  ahead,” the Australian Constructors Association chief executive, Jon Davies,
  said. “This report confirms the need for urgent reform and gives us a clear
  roadmap to get started”. The LNP is also pushing legislation to override more
  than a dozen planning laws – including heritage and environment protection
  laws – to build a swathe of venues for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and
  Paralympic Games.
