  Tesla’s board has approved the award of $29bn (£22bn) worth of shares to its
  chief executive, Elon Musk, after a US court ruled against a previous pay deal
  for the world’s richest person. Musk will pay $2bn to buy 96m shares in the
  electric carmaker at the same price per share as a 10-year pay package agreed
  in 2018, which is stuck in legal limbo awaiting a court date for an appeal.
  The award was based on a recommendation from a “special committee” of the
  board. The announcement in a financial filing was accompanied by a shareholder
  letter from two members of the committee, Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chair, and
  Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. It described the award as a “good faith” payment to
  Musk after the previous pay deal, worth $56bn, was rescinded in 2024 by a
  judge in Delaware, where the company was incorporated until June that year.
  “To recognise what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value he
  delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to
  honour the bargain that was struck in 2018,” the directors wrote. “After all,
  ‘a deal is a deal’.” Denholm and Wilson-Thompson said they had reviewed
  investors’ letters and posts on X – the social media network owned by Musk –
  and acknowledged concerns about his focus on his job. “From those
  communications, we know that one of your top concerns is keeping Elon’s
  energies focused on Tesla,” they wrote. “This award is a critical first step
  toward achieving that goal.” As well as running Tesla, Musk also owns the
  SpaceX rocket company, the social media platform X, the artificial
  intelligence company xAI and the brain implant business Neuralink. He has also
  made forays into Republican politics, damaging the Tesla brand and sales and
  raising concerns among shareholders. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush
  Securities and one of the most prominent voices of concern about Musk’s
  political travails, said the award would remove an overhang – a surplus of
  availability – on Tesla shares, increasing prices. “Musk remains Tesla’s big
  asset,” Ives said. The award is worth about $29bn based on Friday’s closing
  share price. Musk is worth $350bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires
  index. Over the past year, Musk has become embroiled in US politics and a
  political relationship with Donald Trump that turned toxic after the president
  entered the White House for the second time, a feat assisted by the Tesla
  chief executive’s financial and personal support. The furore put off
  left-leaning Tesla buyers inside and outside the US, though competition in the
  electric car market has also affected sales. A survey from the research firm
  S&amp;P Global Mobility shared with Reuters showed that Tesla’s customer
  loyalty has plunged since Musk endorsed Trump. It found 49.9% of Tesla-owning
  households in the market for a new car bought another Tesla last March. This
  was just below the industry average, but was down from 73% in June 2024. It
  edged back up to 57.4% in May this year. Tom Libby, an S&amp;P analyst, said
  the fall was “unprecedented”, adding: “I’ve never seen this rapid a decline in
  such a short period of time.” Musk is Tesla’s largest shareholder, and the new
  shares will take his stake from 13% to about 15%. He has said he wants greater
  control over the company to avoid being ousted by “activist shareholders”. The
  company is shifting its focus to robotaxis and humanoid robots, in a move that
  positions Tesla more as an artificial intelligence and robotics firm than a
  carmaker. “While we recognise Elon’s business ventures, interests and other
  potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging …
  we are confident that this award will incentivise Elon to remain at Tesla,”
  wrote the directors. The award is designed to increase gradually Musk’s voting
  power, something he and shareholders had consistently said was key to keeping
  him focused on Tesla’s mission, the directors added. If the 2018 package is
  reinstated in full following an appeal to the Delaware courts, the new package
  will be forfeited. Tesla shares, which have fallen nearly 20% so far this
  year, rose more than 3% in early trading.
