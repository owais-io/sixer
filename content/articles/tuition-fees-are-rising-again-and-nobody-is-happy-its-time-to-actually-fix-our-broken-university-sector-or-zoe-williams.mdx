  Tuition fees in England go up this year for the first time in eight years and
  the response from universities has ranged from tepid to dismayed. It’s not
  hard to see why: Russell Group analysis found that the new amount of £9,535 a
  year – an increase of £285 – is a real-terms decrease of 26% since 2017. The
  value of the fees has been steadily eroding since 2012, and the original
  figure of a maximum of £9,000 a year was artificially low for many courses
  anyway. Universities started off cross-subsidising expensive courses whose
  costs weren’t met by nine grand a student with the cheaper, classroom-based
  ones, mainly humanities, which were running a surplus. Within a decade, those
  courses – such as history, law, English – were running at or near cost. As the
  value of the fees deteriorated in real terms, staff pay and conditions were
  sacrificed to keep things afloat; by 2021, the University and College Union
  (UCU) found that staff pay had decreased by one-fifth since 2009. Throughout,
  the sometimes astronomical fees paid by foreign students underpinned what was
  otherwise an unaffordable model. This introduced a lot of risk into the system
  – from our own governments, when they have gone to war against student visas,
  and from world events: student numbers were hit when the Nigerian currency
  started struggling, an event over which UK universities had no control. Put
  simply, we have a really strange system in higher education, where nobody
  admits how much things actually cost, nobody admits who’s paying for what,
  research is kept alive on the toil and goodwill of underpaid academics,
  foreign students who represent a huge export market and an incredible success
  story for the sector are treated as if they are somehow on the fiddle, and
  that’s before you even start to consider the matter we generally look at
  first: what this means for graduate debt. The student loan scheme is now on
  its eighth iteration since it was devised by the coalition government.
  Originally, it was designed to be generous, to mollify the Conservatives’
  Liberal Democrat partners. Steadily, the maximum term from graduation has gone
  up (it’s now 40 years in England before your debt is wiped, no longer 30) and
  the earnings threshold at which you start paying has gone down (it’s now
  £25,000). Even those changes don’t protect the government from the students
  who will never earn enough to repay – two years after the loans were
  formalised, parliament estimated that 40% would never fully repay. By 2018,
  that figure had gone up to 83% (though analysts stressed that they might repay
  some, but not all). You could argue that all this is the inevitable result of
  charging tuition fees at all, given that students in the US also labour under
  an astronomical amount of debt, which totalled $1.7tn at the start of this
  year. But the conditions we have created are murkier – unwilling to accept or
  discuss the impact student fees would have on equality of opportunity, we
  chose instead to insist that all universities offered degrees of the same
  financial value, and all courses cost the same, and delivered the same career
  benefits. This has thrown up some ridiculous consequences, in which the
  research that gives a university its standing has become increasingly
  unaffordable for all but the most prestigious institutions. Unable, meanwhile,
  to face the political consequences of a fees hike, successive governments have
  clung instead to the absurd proposition that education is somehow immune to
  inflation. But “student fees aren’t the problem”, Martin Lewis said this week
  on his podcast – an astonishing remark, given the problems they are mired in,
  yet also true, from the perspective of the household. Whichever way you slice
  it, paying back fees is tomorrow’s problem for the student; living costs, by
  contrast, are today’s problem for the family. There’s a separate loan
  available, but it’s means-tested based on family income and under-25s start to
  lose eligibility at a household income of only £25,000. To imagine such a
  household having the savings available to make up any gap is just fanciful;
  which fits the overall picture of a system running on avoidance and delusion.
  A graduate tax is sometimes floated as a more progressive alternative, based
  as it would be on what used to be understood as a foundational principle of
  public policy: that wealthier people can afford to contribute more. This,
  along with the idea of education as a public good, which we all benefit from
  even if we didn’t personally undertake it, has vanished from debate; yet
  nothing systematic or in any way realistic has replaced it. The idea of
  abandoning the fees experiment altogether, meanwhile, is the stuff dreams are
  made of because it would be unthinkably expensive. Yet the status quo we have
  arrived at could hardly be called cheap, unless your idea of thrift is to
  break a system that’s been centuries in the making. Zoe Williams is a Guardian
