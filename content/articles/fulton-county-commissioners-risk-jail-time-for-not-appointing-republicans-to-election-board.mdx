  Fulton county commissioners risk jail time for not appointing Republicans to
  election board

  Fulton county commissioners in Georgia faced a contempt hearing today which
  may end in jail time for violating a court order to appoint two Republicans
  associated with Trump-aligned groups pushing voter fraud conspiracies to the
  county’s election board. The county charter states that commissioners “shall”
  appoint two Republicans and two Democrats nominated by their respective county
  party chairperson, for two-year terms. When commissioners rejected the
  nomination by Fulton county’s Republican party chair, the superior court judge
  David Emerson issued an order requiring the board to appoint them. “The court
  finds that the ‘shall’ as used here is mandatory, and the [board of
  commissioners] does not have discretion to disapprove an otherwise qualified
  nominee,” Emerson wrote in his 3 August order. “It is up to the Fulton County
  Commission to follow the law and honor that person’s nominations.” The
  plaintiffs are seeking an order of both civil and criminal contempt for
  failing to comply with the order. Civil contempt has historically meant an
  ever-increasing series of daily fines until the board complies with the order.
  But a finding of criminal contempt may mean jail time until enough Democratic
  commissioners agree to vote for the appointment. The Fulton county Republican
  party chair, Stephanie Endres, nominated Jason Frazier for a term and
  renominated Julie Adams to serve another term. Frazier is among the most
  prolific challengers of voter registrations in Georgia, and unsuccessfully
  sued Fulton county in federal court in 2024, attempting to force the board of
  registration and elections to purge nearly 2,000 Fulton county voters from the
  state’s rolls ahead of presidential election. Adams is a member of an
  election-denial activist network founded by Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who
  aided his efforts to overturn the election in Georgia and elsewhere. As a
  member of the Fulton county board of registration and elections, Adams refused
  to certify the May 2024 primary, which led to a Fulton county court case that
  ultimately compelled her to affirm the election. That case loomed large in
  court today. The court in Adams v Fulton County held that the act of
  certification was ministerial – a requirement, not a choice – because of the
  language in the law, noted Thomas L Oliver III, an attorney for the
  Republicans. Facing the court’s order, Adams ultimately complied, Oliver said.
  “Now they want to be on the other side of that argument. It’s pretty rich,” he
  added. Don Samuel, the county’s attorney, argued that the commissioners were
  refusing to complete the appointment because they were hoping to overturn the
  lower court’s order on appeal, and making the appointment would render an
  appeal moot. The ministerial function implicit in the language of the law of
  an elected official and an appointed official is a legal distinction for the
  appellate court, he said. “They are not defying this court out of disrespect
  of this court in any way,” Samuel said, acknowledging how their refusal to
  comply with the order looked in light of Democratic arguments about federal
  administration officials’ defiance of court orders. “We can’t help but read in
  the paper about the defiance of the judiciary,” he said. “We are not, despite
  the plaintiff’s overbroad argument here, we are not in defiance of the order.
  We’re trying to protect our rights in appeal.” Fulton county has seven elected
  commissioners, five of whom are Democrats. The lawsuit only named those five:
  Dana Barrett, Mo Ivory, Khadijah Abdur-Rahman, Marvin Arrington and chair Robb
  Pitts. Pitts, Abdur-Rahman and Arrington did not vote on the appointment,
  leaving Barrett and Ivory to vote against it for a 2-2 tie. Social media
  messages from Ivory and Barrett were presented in court, in which the two
  Democrats pledged not to make the appointment. “Those who oversee elections
  must be fully independent and accountable,” Ivory said. “No judge can compel
  any elected official to vote in any way,” said Barrett. “Our elections are
  under attack in this country … This is just another arena where they’re trying
  to chip away at free and fair elections.” The law governing appointments to
  election boards in Georgia is an inconsistent patchwork. In neighboring Dekalb
  county, the chief judge of the county’s superior court is the appointment
  authority. Earlier this year, the judge allowed one controversial Republican
  nominee to be appointed while denying another. In Republican-controlled
  Cherokee county, an affluent northern suburb of Atlanta, county commissioners
  rejected the nomination of the county’s Democratic party to the election
  board, opting instead to find a Democrat they preferred to serve instead.
  Judge Emerson said he would file his ruling later today.
