  Is there any comfort to be had in knowing that police incompetence is not a
  new phenomenon? Not really, no. But it might be all you can find to cling on
  to during this harrowing, heartbreaking four-part drama. I Fought the Law is
  based on the true story of Ann Ming, the murder of her 22-year-old daughter
  Julie in 1989 and her 30-year campaign to change the double jeopardy law so
  Julie’s acquitted killer could be tried again for the crime. I Fought the Law
  has two great strengths. First, the awareness that although the overturning of
  a law that had existed since Magna Carta is technically the most astonishing
  part of Ming’s tale, it is not the most televisual. That, for better or worse,
  will always be the body blows she withstood, from finding her daughter’s body
  three months after she went missing to the two horrendous trials she sat
  through and years of injustice. These would have felled anyone less
  extraordinary (and indeed threatened to fell her husband and their marriage,
  although both made it through in battered but unbowed form). The drama wisely
  confines the legal machinations to the final episode and concentrates
  three-quarters of its time on limning the lives of the Ming family before and
  after Julie’s murder. The second great strength – as is almost always the case
  – is casting Sheridan Smith in the main role. Ordinary women in extraordinary
  circumstances are what she does, and few do it better. Here, she elevates a
  workaday script that dares not take too many liberties, lest it be seen to
  dishonour the story, and makes it genuinely moving. She gets help from the
  strong cast that is – again, as ever – assembled round her. Special mention
  must go to the chilling ordinariness Jack James Ryan brings to the part of the
  murderous Billy Dunlop, and to Daniel York Loh as Ann’s husband and Julie’s
  father, Charlie Ming, a man at first too broken to support his wife and devoid
  of her crusading zeal, but who digs deep to try to bring her what she needs to
  survive. For all its formulaic structure and the traditional beats it is
  careful to hit (winsome child asking poignant questions about mummy,
  bureaucratic nightmares and class snobbery as the doughty nurse faces down the
  British establishment), I Fought the Law does an unusually good job of
  sympathising with, rather than condemning, the half of the partnership to whom
  fighting for justice does not come naturally. Charlie would probably – like, I
  suspect, most of us – prefer to crawl into a ditch and pray for some kind of
  impossible peace. In its way, his quieter journey is as impressive as Ann’s,
  and the drama takes the trouble to show us how. The police spent the initial
  period of Julie’s disappearance insisting that the mother of one, who saw or
  spoke to her mother at least once a day, must have decided to leave her son,
  Kevin, behind and move to London without telling anyone when she separated
  from her husband. After relentless pressure to investigate from Ann, a
  forensics team was sent to examine the house. After five days, they had found
  nothing to indicate foul play. Eighty days after Julie’s disappearance, Ann
  was trying to trace a bad smell in her daughter’s bathroom and found her body
  under the bath. The delay by the police in investigating and finding Julie –
  leaving aside the unfathomable suffering it would have saved her mother –
  meant that the evidence the jury heard in court about the cause of death, and
  other details potentially connecting Dunlop to the killing, was weaker than it
  should have been. That almost certainly contributed to the two hung juries and
  his resulting compulsory acquittal. He was then heard in local pubs bragging
  about committing the murder, safe in the knowledge that he could not be tried
  again. Or so, of course, he thought. The overturning of the archaic double
  jeopardy law is not a pyrrhic one for the family – it gets the violent Dunlop
  off the streets and will help to protect other bereaved people suffering as
  the Mings did. But we are aware of how life changed for them for ever: that
  their daughter (and Kevin’s mother) will never be restored to them because one
  man felt like killing her, could and did. So it goes. • I Fought the Law aired
  on ITV1 and is available on ITVX
