  My father, Cecil Newton, was one of the last surviving British Army Sherman
  amphibious tank soldiers who landed in Normandy in the first assault on D-day,
  6 June 1944. Two years previously, he had joined the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon
  Guards as a gun loader, training in the innovative and top-secret Duplex Drive
  (DD) “swimming” tanks. On 3 June 1944, they sailed from Lepe Beach in
  Hampshire for France. Wading ashore on Gold Beach at dawn, they attacked the
  target blockhouse and the crew surrendered. On attacking Verrières on the 14
  June, they prevailed, but 90 infantrymen and troopers, including Cecil’s best
  friends, were killed, haunting him all his life. They fought through
  devastated Normandy villages, the liberation of Lille, Operation Market Garden
  in the Netherlands, and into Germany, where his brother Frederic, of the 5th
  Royal Tank Regiment, was killed by surrendering prisoners. Cecil, who has died
  aged 101, later founded the Creully Club to ensure that the names of the 127
  of his regiment killed in Europe were not forgotten. From the terrible battles
  he participated in, Cecil believed strongly in the need for resilient links
  across Europe to help prevent further wars, and flew the EU flag, with the
  regimental flag, from his garden. Every May he would cycle in Normandy to
  check on the memorials he helped erect. He was born Hugh Cecil Newton in
  Llanrwst, Wales, to Katie (nee Thomas), who was from an Anglesey farming
  family, and Frederic, a cotton broker in India who then worked in the Hindu
  newspaper London office, when the family settled in Muswell Hill, north
  London. Cecil was educated at the Stationers’ Company’s school, but with the
  outbreak of war was evacuated to Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. On finishing school
  he joined the Home Guard at Muswell Hill and volunteered as a naval clerk in
  Leicester Square. In 1942 he volunteered for the army, and after training at
  Bovington Camp, joined the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards. The next two years
  were spent in training, before heading to France. When his tank was hit in the
  battle for Tripsrath, Germany, in November 1944, a shell shattered his leg and
  he was shot in the chest. Cecil developed gas gangrene, but thankfully
  penicillin was available. After six months in hospital he was invalided out of
  the army. After the war Cecil trained as a surveyor and started the Swindon
  office of Bare, Leaning and Bare, becoming a partner, and settled in
  Aldbourne, Wiltshire, with his wife, Joy (nee Lidstone), a nurse and botanist
  whom he married in 1955. He worked on numerous projects in Wiltshire,
  including the Railway Village in Swindon. His civilian interests included
  helping found the Aldbourne Civic Society, which led to the protection of
  bronze age barrows in the parish, bird-watching, cycling, painting and playing
  the piano. In 2016, he was given the Légion d’honneur and honorary citizenship
  of Creully, and in 2019 the primary school in Creully was named after him. Joy
  died in 2012. He is survived by their three children, Claire, Richard and me,
  and two grandchildren, Joseph and Oscar.
