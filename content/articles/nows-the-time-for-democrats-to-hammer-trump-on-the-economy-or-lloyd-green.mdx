  “Economic Growth Shatters Expectations as President Trump Fuels America’s
  Golden Age,” the White House announced on Wednesday. But within 48 hours, the
  data told a very different story, giving the Democrats a badly needed opening
  if they can muster the competence and focus to seize upon it. On Thursday, the
  US commerce department announced that inflation had ticked up to 2.6%. A day
  later, the labor department reported that unemployment had risen to 4.2% in
  July, and that the US had actually gained 258,000 fewer jobs than previously
  reported. From the looks of things, Donald Trump and his tariffs are damaging
  the economy. Suddenly, things aren’t looking so hot. Rather than copping to a
  screw-up, however, the president immediately laid blame elsewhere. In a
  barrage of posts on social media, he lambasted Jerome Powell, the chair of the
  Federal Reserve, attacked his intelligence and again threatened his tenure at
  the Fed. The president trashed Powell, who he appointed, as “a stubborn
  MORON”. Adding insult to injury, Trump brayed: “IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE
  BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!” But
  things didn’t end there. The tantrum continued unabated. Hours later, Trump
  grabbed another page from the strongman playbook and fired Erika McEntarfer,
  the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He suggested that she had cooked
  the books and was essentially giving aid and comfort to Joe Biden, the man who
  first appointed her. As we know, there is reality and then there is Trump’s
  version of reality. At Friday’s final bell, the Dow had dropped more than 540
  points and the Nasdaq was down 2.24%. The ghost of Trump’s so-called
  “liberation day” had returned to haunt the markets, giving the Democrats ample
  material to work with. Already, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act places Trump
  and the Republicans at odds with their base and with swing voters. According
  to a Wall Street Journal poll, 70% of the US believes the act benefits the
  rich. Beyond that, the tax plan is underwater with the public, 42-52, and is
  disfavored by a majority of independents. Practically speaking, the
  Congressional Budget Office projected in June that nearly 8 million people
  would lose their insurance under the Trump-backed bill. For the current
  iteration of the GOP, that’s a problem. These days, Republican voters tilt
  working class. Many of them break economically liberal and socially
  conservative. This why House Republicans danced around the issue of coming
  Medicaid cuts. They stand to harm their own voters. And they know it. Take
  Mike Lawler, a representative from New York’s Hudson Valley. More than 200,000
  of his constituents receive Medicaid benefits. Town halls in his district have
  become rowdy events, with the police hauling out a constituent. Lawler claims
  to have “fought extensively to make sure that there were not draconian changes
  to Medicaid”. “At the end of the day, this is about strengthening the
  program,” Lawler added. Uh, that’s why he needed the cops. More than 64
  Republican House members represent districts where Medicaid rates exceed the
  national average, according to CNN. In those seats, five incumbents won last
  November by five points or fewer. But the GOP’s problems don’t end with
  Medicaid. These days, social security, the most sacrosanct legacy of the New
  Deal, may be in the crosshairs of Team Trump. On Wednesday, Scott Bessent, the
  treasury secretary, acknowledged the so-called “Trump accounts” created for
  kids by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act were actually a “back door for
  privatizing social security”. The accounts are designed as a vehicle for
  Americans to build and accumulate wealth as soon as they are born. Under the
  new law, newborns will be eligible to receive $1,000 from Uncle Sam. “Social
  security is a defined benefit plan paid out,” Bessent explained. “To the
  extent that if all of a sudden these accounts grow, and you have in the
  hundreds of thousands of dollars for your retirement, then that’s a
  gamechanger.” As a candidate and then again in office, Trump had pledged to
  leave social security untouched. Now that pledge is in doubt. In 2024, the
  Republicans made the economic failures of the Biden-Harris administration
  central to their campaigns. The Trump-Vance campaign raked the Democrats over
  the coals over inflation. In politics, turnabout is fair play. It is time for
  the Democrats to show that they actually care about the average voter. Lloyd
  Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice
  from 1990 to 1992
