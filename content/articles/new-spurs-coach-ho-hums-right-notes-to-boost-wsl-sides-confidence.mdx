  “We’re all in the same boat, in the same way, and no one’s drilling holes,”
  says the new Tottenham head coach, Martin Ho. “The ambition and commitment to
  women’s sports and women’s football is there. Daniel Levy’s got very big plans
  for this club and this team moving forward.” Ho, back in the WSL after two
  years in Norway with Brann, namechecks other senior Spurs personnel and sounds
  a further note of optimism. “When you’re all aligned strategically and you’re
  all going in the right direction I believe you can make things happen,” he
  says, having joined Spurs last month. In the 2023-24 season, Ho guided Brann
  through qualifying into their first Champions League group stage, where they
  finished second before being eliminated by the eventual champions, Barcelona,
  in the quarter-finals. That influential first head coach’s role had followed
  time as an assistant with Everton and Manchester United. “It was probably the
  right time to come back,” the 35-year-old says. “There’s an expansion to the
  WSL and so on and I’ve probably come into it at the right time. More
  importantly, I think this club has huge quality and huge potential that we’re
  not fulfilling. It’s my job to make sure we do. There’s a lot of quality
  within the squad that maybe has not been able to be shown as much as people
  would have liked. The playing style, I feel, will help that.” Ho says he
  inherited a team “low on confidence and maybe belief and motivation too”. A
  sixth-placed finish and run to the Women’s FA Cup final in the 2023-24 season
  was followed by a disappointing 11th-placed finish that resulted in the exit
  of the manager Robert Vilahamn. Vilahamn and Ho are very different characters,
  the softly spoken Swede contrasting with the animated, loud coach from
  Merseyside. Ho says: “The first thing I said to the players was about
  motivation: ‘You have such a wonderful job as a person. There’s a lot of
  people that would love to be in that privileged position; the least we can
  give is an energy, commitment and hard work on the pitch and the quality and
  skill set will follow from the coaching staff.’ “Importantly, I’ve got to make
  sure that they feel valued, respected and trusted, and I want to take the
  reins off a little bit, to show we can be brave and that we’re good enough to
  play a certain way.” Five weeks into the project things seem to be going in
  the right direction. You cannot take too much from a pre-season friendly, but
  a 4-3 win against the European champions Arsenal on Saturday points to an
  improved ruthlessness and has lifted spirits. “I learned where we’re at as a
  group and individually and then the steps we need to take,” says Ho. “It’s
  really nice to see what we’re working on in training and the aspects we’ve
  discussed in education in the analysis room come to fruition. I’m really
  impressed with how they’ve applied themselves and how they’ve embraced
  something totally different to what they’re used to.” What does his football
  look like? “I don’t want to sit back. I know you get pushed back, that’s
  different, I don’t want us to drop back. We’ll be front-footed, like we were
  against Arsenal in moments. I want to make sure that we’re consistently
  stepping forward and defending forward and, with the ball, being exciting,
  being brave and allowing individual players to show their individual
  qualities. I want us to be more expressive as a team so that we’re exciting in
  games and people want to watch us.” Against Arsenal, Ho appeared to resort to
  a plan B when things weren’t quite working. How many plans does he have? “A to
  Z,” he says, with a laugh. “The game is going to throw you so many different
  problems. In England now it’s more of a chess game and you have to be very
  tactically flexible. In the first half we established good structure but we
  weren’t using the structure properly so we readjusted that slightly in the
  second half and that gave us more control and more opportunities to play
  forward and be brave. You have to appreciate Arsenal, they are a super, super
  team and they’re gonna have possession and are going to make us surrender at
  times, and we did, but the important thing for me was the ruthless edge we had
  going forward.” A big job is improving Tottenham’s consistency. “I believe
  persistence gets you there and consistency keeps you there,” says Ho. “We’ve
  got to get persistent before we can get consistent.” Up first for Tottenham is
  a London derby against West Ham a week on Sunday. West Ham finished last
  season strongly but Ho wants Tottenham to plant their flag. “The first game of
  the season is probably how you’re remembered and I want to make sure that
  we’re remembered in the right light,” he says.
