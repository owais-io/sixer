  The mayor of Hiroshima has led calls for the world’s most powerful countries
  to abandon nuclear deterrence, at a ceremony to mark 80 years since the city
  was destroyed by an American atomic bomb. As residents, survivors and
  representatives from 120 countries gathered at the city’s peace memorial park
  on Wednesday morning, Kazumi Matsui warned that the conflicts in Ukraine and
  the Middle East had contributed to a growing acceptance of nuclear weapons.
  “These developments flagrantly disregard the lessons the international
  community should have learned from the tragedies of history,” he said in his
  peace declaration, against the backdrop of the A-bomb dome – one of the few
  buildings that survived the attack eight decades ago. “They threaten to topple
  the peace-building frameworks so many have worked so hard to construct,” he
  added, before urging younger people to recognise that acceptance of the
  nuclear option could cause “utterly inhumane” consequences for their future.
  Despite the global turmoil, he said, “we, the people, must never give up.
  Instead, we must work even harder to build civil society consensus that
  nuclear weapons must be abolished for a genuinely peaceful world.” As applause
  rang out, white doves were released into the sky, while an eternal “flame of
  peace” burned in front of a cenotaph dedicated to victims of the world’s first
  nuclear attack. The ceremony is seen as the last opportunity for significant
  numbers of ageing hibakusha – survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima
  and Nagasaki – to pass on first-hand warnings of the horror of nuclear
  warfare. Just under 100,000 survivors are still alive, according to recent
  data from the health ministry, with an average age of just over 86. On
  Wednesday, the names and other personal details of more than 4,940 registered
  survivors who have died in the past year were added to a registry kept inside
  the cenotaph, bringing the number of deaths attributed to the Hiroshima
  bombing to almost 350,000. In his peace declaration, Matsui recalled how one
  woman had begged for water as fires raged through the city after the Enola
  Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 15-kiloton uranium bomb on Hiroshima on 6
  August 1945, killing an estimated 140,000 people by the end of the year.
  “Decades later, a woman who heard that plea still regretted not giving the
  young woman water,” he said. “ She told herself that fighting for the
  elimination of nuclear weapons was the best she could do for those who died.”
  Three days after the devastation in Hiroshima, the US dropped a plutonium bomb
  on the city of Nagasaki, killing 74,000 people. While the debate continues
  over whether the attacks were morally and militarily justified, many Americans
  continue to believe they forced Japan’s surrender on 15 August. Nihon
  Hidankyo, a nationwide network of A-bomb survivors that last year won the
  Nobel peace prize, said humanity was in a race against time to challenge the
  US and Russia – which together possess 90% of the world’s 12,000-plus nuclear
  warheads – and other nuclear states. “We don’t have much time left, while we
  face a greater nuclear threat than ever,” it said in a statement. “Our biggest
  challenge now is to change nuclear weapons states … even just a little.” At
  8.15am, the exact time the bomb detonated, Hiroshima observed a moment of
  silence. Many attendees lowered their heads and closed their eyes, some
  clasping their hands together in prayer. The advanced age of the survivors of
  the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs has become a defining theme of the
  anniversary. Yoshie Yokoyama, 96, a wheelchair user who visited the park early
  in the morning with her grandson, told reporters her parents and grandparents
  had died as a result of the Hiroshima attack. “My grandfather died soon after
  the bombing, while my father and mother both died after developing cancer,”
  she said. “My parents-in-law also died, so my husband couldn’t see them again
  when he came back from battlefields after the war. People are still
  suffering.” Russia apparently did not send an official to Wednesday’s
  ceremony, but its ally, Belarus, attended for the first time in four years.
  Taiwanese and Palestinian representatives were there for the first time,
  Japanese media reports said. Successive Japanese governments have faced
  criticism for refusing to ratify a 2021 treaty to ban the possession and use
  of nuclear weapons. Dozens of countries have signed the treaty, but they do
  not include any of the recognised nuclear powers or countries, including
  Japan, that are dependent on the US nuclear umbrella. After laying a wreath in
  front of the cenotaph, the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, did not mention the
  treaty but said it was Japan’s “mission” as the only country to have been
  attacked by nuclear weapons to lead global efforts towards disarmament. The UN
  secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement that “the very
  weapons that brought such devastation to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are once again
  being treated as tools of coercion”. Guterres added, however, that Nihon
  Hidankyo’s Nobel prize was cause for hope, adding that “countries must draw
  strength from the resilience of Hiroshima and from the wisdom of the
  hibakusha”.
