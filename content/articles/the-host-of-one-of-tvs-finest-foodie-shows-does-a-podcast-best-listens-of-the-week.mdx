  Pick of the Week Home Cooking With Samin Nosrat and Hrishikesh Hirway Chef
  Nosrat (author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat) and musician and podcaster Hirway (of
  Song Exploder fame) make the perfect double act for a new run of this series,
  which deftly toes the line between affectionate chatter and essential foodie
  resource. It begins with some excellent tips for jam-making, offbeat rhubarb
  recipes and a quest to recreate a listener’s lost family recipe. Hannah J
  Davies Widely available, episodes weekly Bad Elizabeth Super-niche podcasts
  can be super-fun (Google “Dead Eyes” if you’re not sure). Here’s another, as
  Daily Show alumni Kathy Egan-Taylor and Gideon Evans consider infamous
  Elizabeths. First up is Elisabeth Finch, the Grey’s Anatomy writer whose lies
  were more outlandish than anything that happened in the TV drama. HJD Widely
  available, episodes weekly Factory’s Dream Space A third season of Manchester
  arts venue Factory International’s show, which asks celebrities about their
  dreams, starts with artist Marina Abramović (pictured above). From the one she
  had at four years old that led her to start painting to a nightmare about
  dragging a suitcase through a forest, it’s an intimate, meditative listen.
  Alexi Duggins Widely available, episodes weekly Comfort Eating With Grace Dent
  The latest batch of the Guardian’s series opens with the former first minister
  of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon. Her go-to tummy warmer? Beans on toast with
  cheese and Branston pickle. Her view on Jaffa Cakes? “Of course it’s a
  biscuit!” And her assessment of Irn-Bru’s importance to the nation of
  Scotland? “The best cure for a hangover known.” AD Widely available, episodes
  weekly Fifteen: Inside the Daniel Marsh Murders “Ridiculous … I’m a kid.” In
  2013, 15-year-old Henry Marsh was arrested for murdering married couple
  Claudia Maupin and Chip Northup in their home. It’s a case that even 48 Hours
  correspondent Erin Moriarty – who has reported on violent crime for three
  decades – still struggles to make sense of. But she digs deep for this
  podcast. Hollie Richardson Widely available, episodes weekly
