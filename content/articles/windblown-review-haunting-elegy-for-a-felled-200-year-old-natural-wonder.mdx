  If you thought there could not be a more Edinburgh-centric show than James
  Graham’s Make It Happen, with its appearances from Adam Smith and figures from
  the city’s once great banks, well think again. In Windblown, Karine Polwart
  commemorates an Edinburgh institution of similar longevity. And she does it
  exquisitely. Her focus is the sabal palm that stood in the Royal Botanic
  Garden for more than 200 years and, even before that, grew in the original
  gardens at the top of Leith Walk. It outgrew the original glass house within
  decades and towered over generations of visitors until, in 2021, this oldest
  living specimen in the collection had to be chopped down. You might have
  expected a protectionist response from Polwart, but she does not question the
  necessity of the renovations to the Victorian palm houses that are now under
  way as part of the Edinburgh Biomes project, designed to secure the future of
  the collection’s 13,500 plant species. Rather, her tone is elegiac, not least
  because this is also a lockdown-era story, haunted by loss and the need for
  reflection. Following the format of her equally sublime Wind Resistance, she
  blends songs, poetry and spoken word, all delivered in soothing, honeyed
  tones, to celebrate the wondrous natural beauty of the tree and to praise the
  generations of keepers who ensured its survival. With co-composer Pippa
  Murphy, Polwart was artist in residence at the Botanics, and in Windblown she
  draws on conversations with staff whose dedication to the plants is as
  personal as it is professional. One observes that on the day his dog was due
  to be put down, he still gave it a treat in the morning. The palm commands
  similar dedication and respect until the very end. “For the time is nearly
  over,” goes Polwart’s repeated refrain, set to an appropriately timeless folk
  melody. Accompanied by Dave Milligan on grand piano, she stands beneath a wild
  feathery arrangement of fronds designed by Neil Haynes and lit in
  ever-changing colours by Lizzie Powell, as Jamie Wardrop’s sparkling watery
  video projections suggest the epic journey from Bermuda (and its colonialist
  implications). Through it all, Polwart attributes to generations of Edinburgh
  citizens an enterprise of everyday love, care and attention. • At Queen’s
  Hall, Edinburgh, until 13 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
