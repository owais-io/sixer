  Ruben Amorim defended Altay Bayindir after goalkeeping blunders returned to
  haunt Old Trafford when the Turkish player’s error allowed Riccardo Calafiori
  to head in the winner for Arsenal. Amorim was also forced to deny that he had
  dropped André Onana from Manchester United’s matchday squad, saying the keeper
  had not yet trained enough after injury. Bayindir’s mistake came from Declan
  Rice’s 13th-minute corner, the Turk managing only to palm the ball on for
  Calafiori to head in. United complained that Bayindir had been impeded –
  William Saliba appeared to block him – to which Amorim pointed after the
  defeat. “If you watch the ball, [the opponent] is allowed to do a lot of
  things at the corners,” Amorim said. “We need to do the same. But when you
  touch that way [block], the goalkeeper needs to [be able to] use his hands to
  catch the ball, not push players [out of the way]. He chooses to push players
  and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules. If it’s allowed, we need to
  do the same thing.” Amorim was defiant when asked if he considered starting
  Tom Heaton ahead of Bayindir after the latter’s similar error allowed a Son
  Heung‑min corner to go straight in during the 4-3 Carabao Cup defeat at
  Tottenham last season. Amorim referred to Bayindir’s next display, in the FA
  Cup third-round 5-3 penalty shootout win against Arsenal in January. “Why?
  Without VAR [in the competition],” the 40-year-old head coach said. “With VAR,
  it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game? Arsenal. Who saved the
  penalty? Who saved the game?” The Portuguese denied dropping Onana, citing his
  recovery from a hamstring problem. Amorim said: “No, I didn’t drop Onana from
  the squad. I didn’t drop one of the other two from the squad [Bayindir,
  Heaton]. So it’s not the case of dropping Onana. It’s not putting André Onana
  in just one week without seeing the game, without time, with training.” Amorim
  was asked if he is content with Onana, Bayindir and Heaton. “We proved today
  that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great
  team like Arsenal, and we were the better team. I’m happy with the three
  goalkeepers.” After United signed the No 9 Benjamin Sesko for £73.7m, Amorim
  excluded Rasmus Højlund, another centre-forward, from the matchday squad. He
  was asked if this meant the Dane would depart. “We’ll see what is going to
  happen in the market.” Of the defeat, Amorim said: “We deserved more and we
  were the better team, that is clear but in the end we lost. We need to work on
  the things we need to improve. We need to defend set pieces. “We did a lot of
  things right. There are a lot of things without seeing the video that we need
  to work on. I am really proud of my players. We stuck to the plan even when
  the stadium was nervous, we continued to play the way we played and that will
  help us in the future.” Mikel Arteta was delighted with the victory. “Big, big
  result,” the Arsenal manager said. “When you feel that they [United] are
  building something special [and] want to [start] the season in a good way and
  you are able to come away with a win, I think I’m very happy for our team.”
  Arteta was asked about the debut of his new No 9, Viktor Gyökeres. “He did a
  lot of things very well. Coming away from Manchester United, you win your
  first game with Arsenal, it’s a good start,” the Spaniard said.
