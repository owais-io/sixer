  One giant leap for bettongs released into sanctuary as wildlife conservancy
  aims to operate on 5% of Australia

  Like a ball of fur mounted on a spring, they leapt into the crisp night air
  and on to a landscape of acacia scrub where they hadn’t roamed free for maybe
  a 100 years or more. The Australian Wildlife Conservancy last month released
  147 of the brush-tailed bettongs on to its sanctuary at Mount Gibson, about a
  four-hour drive north-east of Perth on the edge of the wheatbelt. “When we
  open the bag, their first thought is just ‘we’re outta here’,” says Dr Bryony
  Palmer, a wildlife ecologist at AWC. Sign up to get climate and environment
  editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter “While they’re in
  the air they figure out where they are and then off they go.” The bettongs had
  been taken from inside an 8,000-hectare fenced “safe haven” within the
  sanctuary – away from the teeth of feral cats and foxes – where 162 of them
  released there in 2015 have now grown to about 1,000. With cats and fox
  numbers being managed by the conservancy outside the fence, the hope is the
  bettongs, also known as woylies, will survive and thrive as they once did
  before Europeans introduced cats and foxes that are prodigious native wildlife
  killers. From bilbies and numbats to quolls and phascogales, eight threatened
  native mammal species – all once locally extinct – have successfully been
  reintroduced over the past decade since the conservancy bought the
  130,000-hectare former sheep property in 2000. ‘5% of Australia’ This week AWC
  will reveal an ambitious strategy to expand this kind of project well beyond
  its already sizeable footprint across the Australian continent. If you add the
  6.8m hectares of land AWC owns or partners on purely for conservation to the
  6.1m hectares where it works mostly with pastoral companies to improve
  conservation, “then that’s significant, globally – it’s about 1.7% of
  Australia” says the chief executive of AWC, Tim Allard. By 2035 the
  organisation hopes to expand the area where it is carrying out conservation
  work – either on its own properties or on land being used for other things,
  such as cattle grazing – to about 5% of Australia’s land mass. “This is about
  where we want to be,” Allard says. “But it’s what we think is necessary to
  secure Australia’s natural heritage.” Australia’s unenviable record on mammal
  extinctions – the worst in the world – is well known. The federal government
  has promised no new extinctions and pledged to have 30% of land protected by
  2030 – part of a global “30x30” conservation goal. “On 30 by 30, we have been
  at pains to say that if that land is not being effectively conserved, then
  it’s all for naught,” Allard says. “30 by 30 is about protecting areas but
  increasingly we have to think beyond that. About 54% of Australia is managed
  for pastoralism. We have to find a way to have sheep and cattle and
  conservation working together.” The 30x30 target for Australia includes
  everything listed on a national reserve system and 24% of the land is now
  protected in areas like reserves and parks managed by local and state
  governments, the commonwealth and not-for-profit conservation groups like AWC.
  To reach its lofty goals, Allard says the organisation wants to grow from its
  $40m-a-year revenue that comes mostly from philanthropy, to a $100m-a-year
  organisation. The conservancy hopes the new high-profile appointment to its
  board of the former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean, the chair of the federal
  government’s Climate Change Authority, will help increase its reach and raise
  more funds. “We’re drawing a line in the sand,” Allard says. “This plan is the
  boldest private response to the extinction crisis in our nation’s history. “We
  have a major challenge in this country with the decline in biodiversity, but
  we also have a massive opportunity. “We want to give people some hope. The
  goal is to grow that philanthropy. Only about 2% of charitable giving in
  Australia goes to the environment. “Most of the world’s biodiversity is in the
  southern hemisphere, but most of the money is in the northern hemisphere. We
  have to find ways to sell Australia internationally.” Ecosystem engineering
  Back at Mount Gibson, the bettongs released last month are being tracked every
  two days with the help of radio collars on 20 of them. Palmer is getting ready
  for the arrival of a team of botanists to survey the sanctuary to see if the
  reintroduction of the small mammals has started to help more native plants
  grow. A lot of Australia’s smaller mammals are “ecosystem engineers” that help
  spread seeds and improve soils with their digging. “When you walk through the
  fenced area, there are these little dig holes everywhere with little seedlings
  growing in them,” Palmer says. Those benefits might be spilling out of the
  fenced area. “We’ve started to get records of the bettongs outside the fence,”
  she says. “It’s six foot high, but they’re good climbers.”
