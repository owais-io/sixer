  Seaside golf can meddle with the most patient of characters. Lottie Woad had
  played herself firmly into the second-round mix at this Women’s Open at five
  under par, but the 16th at Royal Porthcawl was to bite back at English golf’s
  golden girl. Woad’s second shot found trouble – it took Lydia Ko, one of
  Woad’s playing partners, to find the ball – and her third swing barely caused
  any movement whatsoever. Woad called for a referee, plus a second opinion, in
  her belief that her ball was now embedded and worthy of free relief. With the
  claims refused, she had to declare the ball unplayable. This grisly affair
  eventually culminated in a triple-bogey seven and a round of 70 which for so
  long had looked like further demonstrating Woad’s rapid ascent to the summit
  of her sport. “There was a lot more good in it than bad,” said Woad. “I played
  really well for 17 holes, just that one hole cost me a bit. “I think it’s
  probably the toughest hole on the course. The tee shot is hard to hit the
  fairway and then you’ve got three wood into a very strong wind. Anything
  that’s missing the target is going to be exaggerated. So I pushed it and got a
  pretty unlucky lie. It wasn’t too thick around there apart from where I was.
  So I couldn’t really do much with that.” Woad admitted she was disappointed
  that officialdom had declared that her ball was not embedded. “I just had to
  forget about it as quickly as possible,” she added. Woad missed from four feet
  for a birdie at the last, meaning she remains nine adrift of the lead. By her
  own admission, and even owing for the vagaries of links, that may already be
  too far. The broader problem for Woad and all others is that Miyu Yamashita
  has taken quite a grip on this tournament. The Japanese player’s 65 launched
  her to 11 under, meaning a three-shot lead over her compatriot Rio Takeda.
  Yamashita’s bogey-free round included a stunning back nine of 32. Close
  inspection of Yamashita’s form indicates her prominence in Wales should be no
  real surprise. While the terrain might be somewhat different from what the
  23-year-old is used to, jousting at the summit of leaderboards appears second
  nature. She has won 13 times on the Japan Tour and had 43 top-three finishes
  since April 2021. In this, her rookie year on the LPGA Tour, she has recorded
  10 top-20 finishes from 16 starts. Yamashita shares her name with a Japanese
  wrestler, which must lead to some interesting moments when observers are
  punching letters into Google. The golfing Yamashita missed the cut in the
  Women’s Open last year. She appears on a mission to make up for that. Lindy
  Duncan’s 70 moved her to four under, where she has Pajaree Anannarukarn and
  Chiara Tamburlini for company. Madelene Sagström moved into touching distance
  of the group behind Yamashita, the Swede’s 69 meaning a three-under total at
  the 36-hole point. At two under, Porthcawl member Darcey Harry comfortably
  survived for the weekend. “I keep forgetting that this is actually my home
  course and I’ve played it before,” she said. “I have to keep reminding myself
  I know the course, so I don’t know why I’m stressing. I just have to try to
  enjoy the atmosphere. “I think the first two days are usually the most
  nerve-racking because you want to make the cut. Anything can happen on this
  course. You can get in trouble, big trouble any time. I definitely think today
  was quite a stressful day for everyone because the cut’s on the line. I can
  reset for tomorrow.” The world No 1, Nelly Korda, like Woad and Harry, is at
  minus two. There was a golden moment for Steph Kyriacou, who made a hole in
  one with her gap wedge at the 8th. “I didn’t see it go in, which sucked, but
  the crowd went nuts,” said the Australian. “It didn’t damage the hole, which
  was surprising, so it was quite clean. My first official hole in one with no
  asterisk. Pretty excited. I had a hole in one in a practice round before.
  There were witnesses, first ball, but it’s not really the real deal, is it?
  There’s footage, people, tournament, major, it counts. I think everyone on my
  team is going to use it as an excuse to get drunk.” Lilia Vu was among those
  to crash out of this major at the halfway point. Carlota Ciganda, Jennifer
  Kupcho and Sophia Popov, who won this championship five years ago, did
  likewise.
