  The second Trump administration has been worse than Canada’s worst nightmare.
  The largest military force in the history of the world, across a largely
  undefended border, is suddenly under the command of a president who has called
  for our annexation. Canada could not be less prepared. The possibility of
  American aggression has been so remote, for so long, that the idea has not
  been seriously considered in living memory. Donald Trump has focused on
  economic rather than military pressure, but the new tone in Washington is
  finally forcing Canada to ask itself the most basic question: how do we defend
  ourselves? For most other countries in the world, self-defence is the key to
  national identity. Canada’s immense good fortune has been that we haven’t
  really needed a strong military to build our country. In the war of 1812, we
  were British, and the British kept us alive because we were British. There
  hasn’t been an attack on our homeland since. Confederation, the founding of
  the country, was the result of a political negotiation rather than a conquest
  or a violent independence movement. Our military was based on a fundamental
  assumption about our place in the world, and the nature of the world itself.
  Our place in the world was to contribute to the global order. The global order
  shared our fundamental values. Peacekeeping was more our style than defense.
  Recently, I’ve been working on Gloves Off, a podcast about how Canada can
  protect itself from any threat emanating from the US, and from every other
  country in the world now that the US is no longer our protector and guardian.
  The consensus from military and security experts is that we would be “a
  snack”. It is far from unusual for countries sliding toward authoritarianism,
  such as the the United States, to use foreign engagements to justify the
  suspension of their own laws. Trump has already started trumping up crazy
  excuses for anti-Canadian sentiment – a supposed flow of fentanyl over the
  border and other nonsense. His ambassador says Trump thinks our boycotts make
  us “nasty” to deal with. So what does Canada need to do to develop the
  capacity to defend itself? The good news is that Canada’s new reality is far
  from unique. In fact, it’s the historical norm. Finland is a potential model
  for us. It has lived its entire existence next to a belligerent country that
  is either expanding imperially or collapsing dangerously. The Finns do not
  have nuclear weapons. They are only 5.5 million people, next to Russia’s 143
  million. Finland’s strategy is whole society defence. Matti Pesu, a senior
  research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, and a
  reserve commander of an armoured personnel carrier, explained that whole
  society defence does not pretend to be able to overcome a potential Russian
  onslaught. “Power asymmetry is an absolutely essential factor in the Finnish
  security thinking,” he told me. “Given how much bigger Russia is, in order to
  thwart that potential threat, we need to mobilize broadly the resources
  available in society.” Because Finland is geared, throughout its national
  institutions, towards self-defence, its resistance to Russia is credible. The
  idea is not to match Russian military capacity, but to make the conquest of
  Finland not worth the trouble. “Full societal resources of a smaller nation
  can actually be enough to thwart the potential threat from a larger power
  because the costs for the larger power to invade could actually be much higher
  than the potential benefits it would gain from such an invasion,” Pesu
  explains. The more capable a country is of causing pain to occupiers, the less
  likely the occupation happens in the first place. Conscription is essential.
  The Finns can put a million soldiers in the field within 72 hours. But every
  facet of Finnish government, from the healthcare system to the national
  broadcaster, has a role in the security system, and knows its role in a
  possible military conflict. “A preparedness mindset permeates the whole
  society,” Pesu says. “From the state level all the way to an individual living
  somewhere in the country.” To rise to Finland’s level, Canada would need to
  reorchestrate its entire frame of reference. The prime minister, Mark Carney,
  has recently announced serious boosts to national military spending: 2% by the
  end of this year, rising to 5% at some point in the future. But the government
  has pushed its readiness targets back to 2032. And those are targets that
  align with our typical military practices: meeting our commitments to our
  alliances. That money sounds good on a theoretical level. But the Canadian
  military situation has not fundamentally altered. We have not reset our
  position. The period we are entering is a period of deep chaos, of the
  weakening of international institutions, of multiple, interlocked collapses.
  Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false
  hope. If Canada is to remain a stable democracy, we will have to find the
  stability in ourselves. A whole society defence would bolster us against the
  chaos that threatens us from every side and from within. In an era of
  splintering society, conscription is a force of unification, what Pesu calls
  “a strong democratic linkage”. Canada is a big country, with huge geographical
  and demographic diversity. We are as vulnerable as any other society to the
  informational chaos that is overtaking the world, to the incipient breakdown.
  A whole society defence would be a massive force for unification. It would
  establish, to Canadians at least, that there are crises we are going to face
  and we need to face them collectively. The thing about a whole society defence
  is that it determines that you are living in a whole society, a society that
  needs defending. Canada has no history of needing to defend itself. In fact,
  not needing a military is baked into our national identity – and that creates
  a psychological bind. To preserve who we are, we have to overcome one of our
  oldest tendencies, one of our best tendencies: our peace-loving nature, our
  idea of our country as an escape from history rather than its perpetrator or
  victim. And that leads to a very scary question: what will be the crisis that
  makes us realize that we need whole society defence? Let us hope it won’t be
  Canada’s last. Stephen Marche lives in Toronto and is the author of The Next
