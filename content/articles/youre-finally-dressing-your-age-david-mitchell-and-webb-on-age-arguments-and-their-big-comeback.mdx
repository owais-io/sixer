  David Mitchell and Robert Webb are back with their first new sketch show in 15
  years. It’s a comedy smorgasbord that is as random as it is funny, and will
  feel like a glorious throwback for fans of their 00s series That Mitchell and
  Webb Look. And this time they have brought some friends, with guest
  appearances on Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping including Ghosts’ Kiell
  Smith-Bynoe and podcaster and Taskmaster star Stevie Martin. We caught up with
  the pair to chat about Gogglebox, The Two Ronnies, Downton Abbey and snooker.
  A recurring joke in the show is that the younger comedians you feature think
  you are a couple of old farts. Are sketch shows a young person’s game? Webb:
  Well, hopefully, we’re not about to prove that they are. Mitchell: The Two
  Ronnies were quite old. But people seemed to look older in the past than they
  do now, so it might turn out that in the last series of The Two Ronnies,
  Ronnie Barker was 36. Webb: With the greatest respect, David, you are finally
  dressing your age because you have been dressing like a 50-year-old man since
  you were a student. Why do you think sketch shows have been in short supply in
  recent years? Mitchell: They’ve always come and gone in TV fashion. Now a lot
  of sketches happen online, so the thirst for the genre is, to a certain
  extent, sated by random YouTube material. That might be part of the reason.
  People say it’s because they’re expensive. I don’t think they are, really.
  It’s definitely cheaper to make Gogglebox than a sketch show, but it’s
  probably cheaper to make a sketch show than Downton Abbey. Webb: I’m
  marginally cheaper than Maggie Smith was, for a start. David and his wife,
  Victoria Coren Mitchell, have been on Celebrity Gogglebox. Were you
  disappointed, Robert, that David didn’t pick you as his partner? Webb: I was
  neither disappointed nor surprised as I don’t live with David. Actually,
  Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping is on after Gogglebox, so maybe they’ll
  watch it on Gogglebox. I’m not expecting Mary and Giles to really go for it.
  But if the Siddiquis don’t like it, I’ll be quite upset. What’s the idea of
  getting other comedians involved this time? Mitchell: It’s important to have
  people who are under 50 represented in comedy. We were younger comedians who
  came through on Channel 4. So it felt like a good way of doing a show is to
  bring through some younger comedians. Do you realise when you have written a
  fan favourite sketch like “are we the baddies?” or Numberwang? Or does it
  surprise you? Webb: We are not Tony Blair. We don’t think in terms of legacy.
  Sometimes you get a feeling you’re on to something and have to write it down
  immediately. Other ideas, you go: we’ll just let that live in the notebook for
  a little while. But you can’t predict what the audience are going to go for.
  You can only give them what you think is good, then sit back and wait for
  hilarious results. So what’s it like working together again? If you can say
  that you love each other, that would be handy, so we have a good quote. Webb:
  Well, we do, so go ahead. Mitchell: We were best men at each other’s weddings.
  Of course we love each other, but equally, that’s not what people tend to say
  to each other, being English. Webb: You knew that would make us squirm, but
  you’ve got it out of us. My best-manning was easier. It was harder for David
  because it was at the end of a very busy year. I genuinely wondered if he was
  going to be able to find anything nice to say about me at all. But he did. How
  long did you spend arguing whether it was Webb and Mitchell or Mitchell and
  Webb? Webb: I was KO’d in the first round. I think David just muttered
  something about the alphabet and I kind of went along with it. Mitchell: I
  mean, I did deploy the alphabet as the reason. Webb: I could have deployed –
  if I’d had the wit, which I demonstrably didn’t – that one syllable comes
  before two syllables. If you hadn’t become a comedy double act, what else
  might you like to have become? Mitchell: How about Mappin &amp; Webb, the
  jewellers? I’m not interested in setting up a separate business where I get
  second billing. Not only do I have to stop being a comedian and become
  something I don’t want to do, like be a lawyer, an estate agent or a
  silversmith, but I also have to play second fiddle. Webb: And I have to carry
  on just being “and Webb”. You can only imagine how much I’m not into this. •
