  My 83-year-old mother recently confessed to me that she has never had an
  orgasm. My father has a terminal illness and, realistically, won’t be with us
  much longer. My mum is therefore slowly and, with difficulty, contemplating a
  life without her partner of more than 50 years. I want to help her appreciate
  that a life without my dad can still be fulfilling, and I wonder whether a
  part of that could be to discover self-pleasure. Is that possible at her age?
  And, if so, could it be more traumatic to discover that she lived for so long
  without knowing the sensation of orgasm or sharing that with her partner? Just
  as importantly, is this a conversation that an adult child should have with
  their mother, and how should I go about it? I know a lot of people will feel
  uncomfortable about this, but I think it’s great that your mother is able to
  talk to you about these issues. She may also be wanting to impart some wisdom
  to you, perhaps about how important women’s pleasure is. And it’s interesting
  she’s spoken to you and not her friends. Did she ask for actual help? How was
  it couched? Your mother also has a condition which you asked me not to
  mention, and the medication for this can cause a reduction in desire or a
  heightened sexuality, so that is also something to consider. It may indeed be
  the latter, given the conversation happening now. There’s a lot going on in
  your lives, not least the prospect of profound grief, and I am very sorry
  about your dad’s illness. It’s never too late to discover the joys of
  self-pleasure. I went to counselling psychologist and psychosexual and
  relationship therapist Jo Coker, who is also director of therapy and training
  standards at COSRT, the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists. She
  pointed out that it is not too late for your mum to have psychosexual and
  relationship therapy, either now or at a later date. “Your parents’ marriage
  has been a long one, and I expect your mother may have held on to the hope
  that an orgasm would eventually happen. Your father’s illness not only ends
  that hope, but incurs great loss and grief at losing her life partner and
  considering her future. “The good news is that of course she can be helped at
  83 – 10% of people over 90 are still sexually active. If she does go to
  specialist therapy, the first thing would be to take a full history of her
  sexual development and sex life. Is there anything that may be preventing her
  from being able to orgasm?” There will also be questions relating to her
  understanding of sex, Coker explains. “Women of your mum’s generation may not
  be aware that clitoral stimulation is often needed to orgasm and there are
  several ways to achieve this.” If your mum does want to explore sex toys,
  Coker recommends taking into consideration “age-related factors such as any
  physical issues”. The best way to broach this subject is to refer back to the
  conversation she had with you about not having had an orgasm, and explain that
  there are other ways beyond penetrative sex with another person. I am guessing
  you won’t want to show her this reply, but that could be useful. Going to see
  a therapist may be a huge step – maybe one too far – for your mum, but it may
  also help her with the pre-emptive grief she feels. If we remove the idea of
  any sort of shame about sex, what we’re left with is a conversation about
  pleasure. Yes, not many mothers and daughters discuss this, but that’s not to
  say one can’t or shouldn’t. • Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a
