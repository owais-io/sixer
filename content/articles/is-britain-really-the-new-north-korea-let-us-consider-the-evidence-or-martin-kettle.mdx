  Tell me, fellow Brits, how are you getting used to our island version of North
  Korea? How are you coping with life, now that we are a global pariah alongside
  Pyongyang? How do you feel about modern Britain having to vie with North
  Korea, Myanmar and Afghanistan for the wooden spoon on every international
  index of oppression? For that is the country Wednesday’s Daily Mail front page
  insists we have now become. It is tempting to laugh off a headline that asks
  “When did Britain become North Korea?” as just another
  here-today-gone-tomorrow piece of journalistic hyperbole. That’s even more the
  case when you read the cobbled-up pandemonium of provocations that form the
  contents of the headline-writer’s charge that Britain is being strong-armed
  into “Starmer’s socialist utopia” – nervy bond markets, the possibility of
  compulsory ID cards, the arrest of the Father Ted writer for his tweets and,
  of course, Angela Rayner. But there is something more at work here. The plain
  fact is that this list simply does not compare with North Korea’s place near
  the top of the global slavery index or at the foot of the international index
  of economic freedom. Some actions of the British state are undoubtedly
  annoying and wrong – even sometimes iniquitous. But there is still a gulf
  between the charge sheet and what Amnesty International calls the North Korean
  state’s untrammelled ability to “exercise total control over all aspects of
  life”. These things should hardly need saying, yet the increasing reality is
  that they now must be said. Parts of Britain’s political debate, if you can
  use that word any longer, are now routinely infused with a hysterical
  dystopianism, of which the Mail front page or the casual use this week by a
  Telegraph columnist of the phrase “Starmer’s Stasi” are classic examples. Both
  the old and the new media facilitate this, provoking governments – Labour
  today but previously also the Conservatives – into poorly thought-out
  legislative responses to manageable problems. The net result, however, is that
  overstatement and exaggeration dominate our debates, squeezing out much-needed
  truth, proportion, fairness, reason and judgment in politics and government.
  Even now, a strong dose of all five of these qualities would surely have made
  a better job of clarifying – and in some cases, preventing – the four
  different genuine problems on which the Mail based its silly North Korea
  comparison. First, it is true the UK bond market moved up again this week. The
  UK economy is stuck. But the main cause of nerves in the bond markets is
  global – caused by Donald Trump’s assaults on the Federal Reserve’s
  independence. That is washing over into many European markets, not just
  Britain. The idea that the UK market is uniquely spooked is false. Second, it
  is also true that ID cards are again on the UK government’s agenda. In other
  circumstances, the Tory press might be in favour, because digital IDs might
  bar unregistered migrants from working in the informal economy. But even a
  convert to ID cards, like me, who prefers the state rather than Elon Musk to
  control the digital world, needs to grasp that the system may not shrink the
  shadow economy very effectively. When Britain used wartime ID cards to enforce
  rationing, the black market still thrived. The Heathrow arrest of the Father
  Ted creator Graham Linehan looks, on the evidence, a very questionable use of
  police time. As the Met commissioner says, the law should be redrafted to be
  more sensitive to legitimate disagreements. All the same, one of Linehan’s
  tweets did suggest an act of violence. Social media, like the internet, has to
  be policed so that incitement is prevented and deterred, and I would rather
  the police did this than the untrustworthy tech giants. Unlike the Tory press,
  I have no problem with Angela Rayner’s ambition or dress sense. I also know a
  popular politician when I see one, and that popularity probably explains why
  Rayner is such a media target. Yet she herself now admits she paid less tax on
  a property than she should have. Few of us know the full facts, so we must
  wait for the adviser on ministerial interests to report. In short, none of the
  four problems covers Britain in clouds of glory. None is the envy of the
  world. Yet none of them, either singly or in combination, justifies the level
  of panic and hyperbole that you read daily in the rightwing media. We all know
  that Britain is working badly. But what can explain something as egregiously
  unfair as the North Korea comparison? The answer may lie in the right’s abject
  craving for a British Trump in the shape of Nigel Farage. Farage appeared in
  Washington on Wednesday in front of the House judiciary committee. Misbilled
  as the Rt Hon Nigel Farage (I trust he corrected the US committee that he is
  neither right nor honourable), the Reform UK leader was there to attack the
  EU’s Digital Services Act and the UK’s Online Safety Act. Above all, though,
  he was there to pander to the lie, promoted by many Republicans, that Britain
  and Europe are intolerant enemies of free speech because they favour some
  degree of control of the terms of public debate rather than none. Yes, some of
  Britain’s and Europe’s laws on these subjects need to be rethought. But the
  real North Korea comparison is in places such as Russia, China and even,
  embryonically, in the United States itself. By their toadying to Trump, Farage
  and his sycophants are doing their utmost to bring to these shores the very
  thing by which they claim to be so outraged. Martin Kettle is a Guardian
