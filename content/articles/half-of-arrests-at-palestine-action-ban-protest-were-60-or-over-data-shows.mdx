  Half of the people arrested during the protest in relation to Palestine Action
  in London on Saturday were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. A
  total of 532 people were arrested at the largest demonstration relating to the
  group since it was proscribed last month. All but 10 were under Section 13 of
  the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive placards or signs. An age
  breakdown released by the Metropolitan police on Sunday revealed that nearly
  100 of those detained were in their 70s and 15 were in their 80s. Of the 519
  arrested people with confirmed dates of birth, 49.9% were 60 or older.
  Hundreds attended the event in Parliament Square organised by Defend Our
  Juries, which asked participants to hold up signs saying: “I oppose genocide.
  I support Palestine Action.” Among those arrested was Sir Jonathon Porritt,
  75, a former government adviser who said he had long been concerned about the
  erosion of civil liberties under successive governments. He was arrested under
  Section 13and bailed until 23 October He described the proscription of
  Palestine Action as “a measure of the government’s desperation” and “entirely
  inappropriate”. “I thought this was overreach by the home secretary, trying to
  eliminate the voices of those who are deeply concerned about what is happening
  in Gaza,” he said. “This was an absolutely clear case of a government using
  its powers to crush dissenting voices when it is the government itself that is
  most reprehensible for what continues to be an absolute horror story in the
  world. “What we are seeing now in Gaza has just utterly shocked people and
  it’s completely abhorrent that we are living through a genocide on our TV
  screens.” Porritt said he had no complaints about how he had been treated,
  describing officers as courteous. Some, however, said older people who had
  been arrested were denied access to water and were kept waiting for long
  periods in the sun to be processed. In a statement on X posted on Sunday
  evening, Defend Our Juries said everyone arrested at the march had been
  released from police custody and no one had been charged. The Met said it had
  taken precautions before Saturday’s operation on the basis of its duty of care
  and because of the age of those who had been arrested at previous protests. It
  also said the decision to turn out was a question of “personal
  responsibility”. “There was water available at the prisoner processing points
  and access to toilets. We had police medics on hand as part of the policing
  operation and we processed people as quickly as possible to ensure nobody was
  waiting an unreasonably long time,” the force said. “Notwithstanding that, a
  degree of personal responsibility is required on the part of those who chose
  to come and break the law. They knew they were very likely to be arrested
  which is a decision that will inevitably have consequences.” Others arrested
  include Chris Romberg, 75, a former British army officer colonel and military
  attache at UK embassies in Egypt and Jordan, and the son of a Holocaust
  survivor. Like Porritt, he was arrested under Section 13 and bailed. He said:
  “This is a serious assault on our freedoms. “When I protested against the US
  war in Vietnam, we were able to chant ‘victory to the NLF’ without being
  criminalised. Now a statement of support for a non-violent direct action group
  is prosecuted under anti-terrorism legislation.” He had no complaints about
  police treatment. Alice Oswald, 58, an award-winning poet, said she had urged
  police who detained her to write to the home secretary about the position they
  had been put in. “Clearly there were some police officers who were really
  struggling with what they had to do,” she said. “You could see the slightly
  shifty look in their faces, too. When I was speaking to them in the police van
  I did say: ‘Write to Yvette Cooper and tell her that this is making your life
  impossible.’” Oswald, who won the TS Eliot prize in 2002 and was professor of
  poetry at the University of Oxford, said her motivation for taking part
  included the very personal experience of giving online poetry classes
  regularly to young people and children in Gaza. She said she had been arrested
  under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act, which relates to inviting support for a
  proscribed organisation. Of the 532 arrests, six people were detained for
  allegedly assaulting police officers after large numbers protesters gathered
  in central London for a separate march organised by the Palestine Solidarity
  Campaign and others. One arrest was for obstructing a constable in the
  execution of his or her duty, two were for breaching Section 14 Public Order
  Act conditions, and one for a racially aggravated public order offence.
  Eighteen people were still in custody by 1pm on Sunday but were expected to be
  released hours later. In the age breakdown of arrests, the Met said the dates
  of birth of 13 people awaited clarification and were not included. On that
  basis, the average age of those arrested was 54. Males accounted for 263 of
  those detained, females 261 and eight either defined themselves as non-binary
  or did not disclose their gender. Ten people have been charged across the UK
  for suspected offences under the Terrorism Act since the proscription of
  Palestine Action, authorities said last week. The home secretary proscribed
  Palestine Action last month after activists caused an estimated £7m of damage
  to jets at the RAF Brize Norton military base in Oxfordshire. Cooper has said
  the decision was based on strong security advice and followed what she
  described as “disturbing information referencing planning for further
  attacks,” the details of which cannot yet be publicly reported because of
  ongoing legal proceedings.
