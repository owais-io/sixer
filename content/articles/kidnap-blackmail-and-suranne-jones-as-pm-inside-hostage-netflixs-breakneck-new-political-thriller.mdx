  Hostage is a political thriller, and observes the conventions in many ways.
  The pace is absolutely flawless, it’s twisty, it has emotional heft. The
  British prime minister, Abigail Dalton, played by Suranne Jones, faces her
  husband, Alex Anderson (Ashley Thomas), being kidnapped. Their marriage is
  well drawn – “it’s happy, it’s assured, they’re supportive of each other,”
  Jones says. As we chat in Netflix’s central London offices, she’s always
  saying five things at once, only one of them out loud. Here, the subtext (I’ve
  decided) is: it’s actually pretty skilled work, creating a not-schmaltzy,
  passionate but familiar love match in which all the audience’s hopes and
  prayers are with the abducted spouse. That’s why normally when fictional
  politicians are the victims of a family kidnapping, it’s one of their kids.
  Meanwhile, the French president, Julie Delpy’s Vivienne Toussaint, is also in
  Britain, is also being blackmailed, and has her own dilemmas: principally,
  does she go over to the dark side, by echoing the far right on anti-immigrant
  narratives, or stick to her principles, whatever those may still be. Delpy is
  hilarious on this, and actually most things. “That’s something I found
  interesting in the show. Sometimes I wonder, I truly wonder, is there any
  politician who really has a conscience? I look at Macron – I cannot believe
  someone with a conscience wouldn’t be questioning themselves, questioning who
  they have picked [as a cabinet], questioning what’s going on with French
  politics.” “You really wonder whether any politician has a conscience?” I ask,
  just to be clear. “Well, yes.” Hostage came about through a lot of to-and-fro
  between Matt Charman, the writer and creator, and Suranne Jones – the pair
  shared an agent 10 years ago and always got on. He’s most famous for Bridge of
  Spies, which Steven Spielberg directed and the Coen brothers co-wrote, in
  2015. “Every time I watch Suranne,” he says, “I’m aware of how relatable and
  human she is. I thought: ‘OK, if she were prime minister, maybe I would feel
  differently about political drama. What if we bought ourselves goodwill with
  someone like Suranne, that would allow an audience just for a second to say:
  ‘Hang on a minute. Let me hear her out’?” As much as Charman is a storyteller,
  enamoured of the thriller form, he also has this surprising sense of civic
  purpose, of using the show to suggest that maybe if we thought of politicians
  as fully human, they might turn out to be, well, at least human-adjacent.
  “Someone used the phrase ‘sophisticated protein’, and it’s one of those
  American phrases that makes you wince, but truthfully it’s quite an
  interesting formulation. People might enjoy the propulsiveness of the
  thriller, but they want the values of the lead character to be about something
  and their backstory to be meaningful.” The result is quite unusual, in so far
  as – unlike all political thrillers – it doesn’t remind you of any other. It’s
  a little biting but it’s not House of Cards cynical, it has a breakneck pace
  but it’s not 24, the dialogue is sharp but never played for laughs. Jones is
  relatable, patriotic, trying her best, absolutely in love with her kidnapped
  husband, an almost nostalgic portrait of an idealised prime minister from more
  innocent times. Delpy is far more worldly, far more compromised, both a better
  fit for the turbulence of modernity and more likely to be capsized by it. The
  whole dynamic marches in an interesting syncopation with the real-life
  politics that unfolded as they shot it, in which the far-right pressures on
  the European political landscape have become much more pronounced, and through
  that lens you could squint at it and see it almost as documentary drama. Then
  there’ll be a giant explosion outside Downing Street or a kidnapper in an
  eerie mask, and you’re back in the world of the blockbuster summer thriller.
  “The hardest thing about writing something that’s in dialogue with where we
  are now,” Charman says, “is that every time something happens in real
  politics, mainly you’re thinking: ‘What does this mean for my kids, is the
  world OK?’ But on a low level, you’re thinking: ‘Does this mean my drama is
  going to be out of date when it comes out?’” “I thought it was very clear as a
  story,” Delpy says. “To me it seemed very accessible, and actually quite
  entertaining.” She’s a breath of fresh air, talking about her work, never
  breathy, always surprisingly impartial, like a mother saying about her
  children: “Yes, the middle one’s quite intelligent, but the youngest, not so
  much.” She’ll never buy into the idea that politicians are inherently
  interesting – “at least in France, I’ve never really been amazed by any of
  them” – and thinks, in some ways, drama is miles from the reality of politics,
  by definition, because real life has lost the plot. “The way politics works
  now, is that they bombard you with outrageous things, so that you forget what
  happened yesterday,” she says. “It’s almost impossible to stand against
  anything. It’s a very difficult time.” Yet one central theme, the demonisation
  of migrants for political capital, dominates her character’s arc. “She starts
  off as someone who isn’t flirting with the extreme right, and she slowly
  starts to go there – which is something you see happening a little bit to
  everyone in the centre; they’re not necessarily ideologically far right, but
  they’re feeling they have to flirt with it, to comply with the perceived
  demands of the electorate. They think it’s better if we slide to the right to
  stay in power, rather than having the far right in power. I think they really
  do believe that, you know.” Drama is making its own, more subtle compromises
  with the new right, which is to avoid “not just leftwing projects but anything
  that has any views on social issues at all. Unless it’s pure entertainment
  with no political consciousness whatsoever, unless it’s The Troll 5, it’s hard
  to get it made,” Delpy says. “I made a film recently called Meet the
  Barbarians, it’s about refugees. And it was really hard to find funding for
  it. And it’s a comedy, it’s really entertaining. Hostage also was not the
  easiest thing on the planet. Of course they had Netflix, and once you have
  that all is well, but every project has its hurdle.” Suranne Jones is also an
  executive producer on Hostage. “I was born with a clipboard,” she says,
  “literally, came out of my mum’s womb, ticking things off on my to-do list. I
  have no interest in directing, no interest in telling other actors what to do
  or my vision. But finding new talent, putting teams together, the writers’
  room process, the imagining of what a show could look like, the aftermath – I
  love all that.” It made her very unprecious about the edit. “I really felt I
  needed to put the human into the prime minister, constantly. And, actually, we
  probably edited a lot of that out.” Hostage is plainly female-led, in the
  sense that the leads are women, as are the two directors – Isabelle Sieb and
  Amy Neil – but that doesn’t feel like a laboured or radical act. You don’t get
  the sense that these fictional female leaders have brought an emotional range
  that men couldn’t possibly have, nor that you’re in an idealised near-future
  where electorates have finally woken up to the fact that women can be in
  charge. “In the US, they have this very negative view of women in politics,
  but it’s not like that in Europe,” Delpy says simply. If anything, Hostage
  makes a subtler gender point, that the differences within the sexes are
  greater than any between them. “Suranne and Julie present such a different
  view of what a powerful female leader is,” Charman says. “Julie’s got this
  incredible directing career, an amazing track record in French and American
  cinema. And there are not many people who burn as brightly on screen as
  Suranne. I thought: ‘what would it look like for them to go toe to toe?’” A
  lot of people have called Hostage the new Bodyguard, partly because it’s so
  satisfying as drama – the way it races, the way it pays off, the way you don’t
  feel as if you’re being played, even though someone’s always in charge of your
  emotions and it’s definitely not you. Yet you wouldn’t call it escapist, when
  so many moments and gestures in it clarify rather than distract from the chaos
  and impossible choices of the world we’re in. Or, at least, the world we’re in
  today. Julie Delpy says: “One friend of mine, who survived the second world
  war, said: ‘Things can always get worse. You think you’re in the worst
  situation but, unfortunately, there’s always worse than what you think is the
  worst.’” Against her sardonic pessimism, Charman can sometimes sound almost
  innocent. “If you can pull the humanity through the thriller all the way to
  the end, then hopefully you’ve got the journey that you always wanted to go
  on,” he says, winningly. After all, thrillers need some innocence. Hostage is
  on Netflix on 21 August.
