  Ministers face a backlash from Labour-run town halls after it emerged deprived
  inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds under a proposed
  funding shake-up despite promises to redistribute cash away from wealthy
  areas. Central London councils with high levels of poverty and homelessness,
  including Camden, which includes Keir Starmer’s parliamentary seat, could lose
  more than 10% of their funding under the proposals, according to the Institute
  for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Several economically deprived northern areas,
  including South Tyneside, Sunderland, Gateshead and Wigan – each of which has
  high child poverty levels – were also expected to lose out under mooted
  changes to the English councils’ funding formula. The IFS said it was
  “surprised” the government’s proposed funding formula changes were not more
  strongly geared towards deprivation – and warned that some areas with
  traditionally high needs associated with poverty would lose millions of
  pounds. The thinktank said its analysis showed how changes to the way funding
  is shared among English councils from next April would have potentially
  dramatic impacts on individual councils, with big “winners” and “losers”
  emerging from the process. The funding formula review consultation was
  announced by the communities secretary, Angela Rayner, last autumn with a
  promise the new system would take more account of deprivation to create a
  “fairer” system that “targets money where it is most needed”. However, the IFS
  said it was “surprising” there was not a stronger deprivation effect: “Despite
  … an expectation that deprived and urban areas would win at the expense of
  more affluent and rural areas, the government’s baseline funding reform
  proposals are not particularly redistributive to poor, urban areas of
  England.” Councils in the north and Midlands with the highest deprivation
  scores such as Blackpool, Bradford, Middlesbrough, and Wolverhampton are
  gainers, while some of the biggest losers are affluent Surrey, Wokingham, and
  Windsor and Maidenhead. Overall, about one in four councils would have a
  real-terms fall in funding over the next three years, with 30 facing cuts of
  11-12%, the IFS estimates. At the other end of the scale about 25% of
  authorities would have funding increases of 12% or more. Labour-controlled
  central London boroughs such as Camden, Islington, Wandsworth, and Hammersmith
  and Fulham could face real-terms cuts in funding of up to 12% over the next
  three years – possibly reflecting technically lower deprivation scores in
  recent years as a result of demographic changes and gentrification. London
  Councils vigorously challenged the proposals. It was “gravely concerned” about
  what it called unevidenced plans that had not been properly road-tested and
  did not reflect the needs of low-income communities in the capital. Claire
  Holland, the chair of London Councils, said: “This would have major
  implications for our most vulnerable groups of residents: London has the
  highest rate of poverty in the country once housing costs are factored in, and
  one in 50 Londoners is homeless and living in temporary accommodation.” It
  believes the proposed formula underplays London’s extreme housing costs and
  high levels of overcrowding and fails to capture high levels of poverty and
  demand for children’s social services. It warned the capital could lose £1.5bn
  under the children’s services funding formula alone. In regional terms, the
  biggest losers under the proposed formula are London (-7%), the south-east
  (-2%) and the south-west (-1%), according to the IFS. The big regional winners
  are the East Midlands (+6%) and Yorkshire and the Humber (+4%). However, there
  is wide variation at local level, with urban shire districts such as Crawley
  in West Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Norwich likely to see real-terms funding
  increases of 12% or more. No final decisions on the new funding formula have
  been taken and there is likely to be intensive horse-trading between councils
  and Whitehall before the new arrangements are agreed and phased in over three
  years from April. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and
  Local Government said: “The current, outdated way in which local authorities
  are funded means the link between funding and need for services has broken
  down, leaving communities left behind. “That’s why we are taking decisive
  action to reform the funding system so we can get councils back on their feet
  and improve public services, with the IFS recognising that our changes will
  better align funding with councils’ needs.”
