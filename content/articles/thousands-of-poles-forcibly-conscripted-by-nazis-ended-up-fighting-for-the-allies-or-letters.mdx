  Your report (‘Our boys were forced into the enemy army to save loved ones’:
  the second world war exhibition dividing Poland, 20 August) makes
  uncomfortable reading for many Poles, or indeed Poles born in the UK after the
  second world war. However, the article fails to mention that around 90,000
  Poles who had been forcibly conscripted into the Wehrmacht later ended up
  fighting for the Polish Armed Forces in the west. These men would have
  deserted and crossed over into allied lines or else been captured by allied
  forces during fighting and taken as prisoners of war. A thorough intelligence
  debriefing would have followed, and the majority of those deemed suitable then
  fought against the Nazis. Krzysztof Nowakowski Vice-chairman, Polish Institute
  and Sikorski Museum • My former boss was Polish. Faced with the unenviable
  choice between death in a concentration camp and service under the Wehrmacht,
  he chose the latter. He told me that much of his time was spent sabotaging his
  own equipment, a risky occupation in which he and his comrades regularly
  engaged. Dr Allan Dodds Bramcote, Nottinghamshire • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
