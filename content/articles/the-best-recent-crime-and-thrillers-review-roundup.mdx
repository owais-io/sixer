  A Particularly Nasty Case by Adam Kay (Orion, £20) The first novel for adults
  from the author of bestselling medical memoir This Is Going to Hurt is,
  unsurprisingly, set in an NHS hospital. Dr Eitan Rose is a hot mess of guilt
  and self-hatred who buys cocaine from the hospital pharmacist to put in his
  nasal spray and has a talent for getting himself caught in comically
  compromising positions. Admittedly, the unexpected death by heart attack of
  his old enemy, consultant Dr Douglas Moran, does get him out of a tight
  corner. However, given that the man had just recorded a normal
  electrocardiogram, Eitan is suspicious – although the police see nothing amiss
  until his attempts to investigate cause him to become the number one suspect.
  The mixture of hospital soap, humour – some of it, such as the porter named
  Cole, rather laboured – and serious point-making won’t work for every reader,
  but Eitan’s manic energy carries us through what is, on the whole, a zippy and
  enjoyable read. Murder Takes a Vacation by Laura Lippman (Faber, £9.99)
  Lighter in tone than her previous books, bestselling American writer Lippman’s
  latest novel puts Muriel Blossom, a supporting actor in the author’s PI Tess
  Monaghan series, centre stage. The sixtysomething widow is on her first trip
  to Europe but her plans go awry when she meets the charming Allan on her
  flight to London and misses her connection. After a delightful day spent in
  his company, Mrs Blossom continues to Paris as planned, but things take an
  unexpected turn when she learns that her erstwhile companion has died in
  suspicious circumstances and it becomes clear that somebody is taking a great
  deal of interest in the contents of her luggage. And who is the mysterious
  Danny Johnson, who seems to want to be her new best friend? Masterful plotting
  and pacing, elements of American-in-Europe-style romantic comedy, a lightness
  of touch and a delightful protagonist add up to a top-notch holiday read. The
  Final Vow by MW Craven (Constable, £20) The seventh instalment in Craven’s
  award-winning series sees grumpy maverick cop Washington Poe recalled from a
  punishment posting on a Royal Navy/Border Force initiative – we catch up with
  him as he’s bludgeoning a recalcitrant colleague with a halibut – for the
  purpose of tracking down a sniper who is causing widespread panic by picking
  people off, apparently at random, in different locations. There’s plenty of
  action and some splendid set pieces, including Poe’s visit to trauma therapist
  Dr Clara Lang, who, it’s fair to say, has some issues of her own. The central
  “odd couple” relationship between Poe and filterless genius Tilly Bradshaw
  provides some light relief, as does Poe’s upcoming wedding to sarcastic
  pathologist Estelle Doyle. Craven sticks to his tried-and-tested formula,
  complete with a trademark smattering of fascinating facts, and although the
  dramatic ending is somewhat undermined by an information dump explaining
  events, this is a high-octane thriller that won’t disappoint. The Dead Husband
  Cookbook by Danielle Valentine (Viper, £16.99) When editor Thea is offered a
  chance to work on a celebrity chef’s tell-all memoir, she jumps at it. Maria
  Capello not only has a cookery empire – books, a television show and a range
  of sauces – but she also has a mystery in her life: the chef husband who
  disappeared 30 years earlier, about whom speculation has long been rife. She
  is, however, paranoid about leaks, and insists that Thea work on the book at
  her farm in the Catskill mountains. The place is not quite the Instagrammer’s
  dream Thea had imagined: it’s isolated and foreboding, with a slaughterhouse
  on the premises, strange family members and a walk-in freezer that may contain
  something more than animal carcasses … Atmospheric, suspenseful and studded
  with interesting recipes (I can vouch for the spiced pear galette), this is a
  compelling take on marriage, motherhood, love, and the sacrifices that women
  are routinely expected to make. The Man Who Died Seven Times by Yasuhiko
  Nishizawa, translated by Jesse Kirkwood (Pushkin Vertigo, £14.99) First
  published in Japan in 1995, The Man Who Died Seven Times is the first of
  Nishizawa’s novels to be translated into English. The story begins on New
  Year’s Eve, when Reijiro Fuchigama’s daughters and their children gather at
  his home in order to hear who will inherit his restaurant empire. Reijiro, a
  capricious and rather mean-spirited individual, makes it clear that it’s not
  only relatives who are in the running: two staff members stand an equal chance
  of scooping the pool. He is, however, killed before he has the chance of
  naming his successor. So far, so conventional – but his youngest grandson,
  Hisataro, has a strange condition that causes him to repeat random days of his
  life nine times, and the day of his grandfather’s murder is the beginning of
  one of these time loops. As Hisataro repeatedly attempts to discover the
  identity of the culprit and therefore prevent the killing, complications pile
  up. An ingenious and highly entertaining riff on the themes of time and
  chance.
