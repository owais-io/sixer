  Big news, everyone: time is cancelled. Mariah Carey says so. “I don’t allow it
  – it just doesn’t happen,” the diva delle dive told Harper’s Bazaar. “I don’t
  know time. I don’t know numbers. I do not acknowledge time.” Carey made this
  proclamation in response to a question about how she deals with ageing while
  wearing “white Fendi pyjamas over a plunging black bra, with six-inch Gianvito
  Rossi heels”, which is exactly how I want my supreme planetary dictator to
  dress. Carey is famous for cancelling stuff – stairs (won’t do them), J-Lo
  (doesn’t know her), James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke (refused to sing) and
  overhead lighting (no) – but this might be her finest work yet. She has had
  time in her sights for a while, telling Out magazine: “I don’t count years,
  but I definitely rebuke them,” in 2014 and claiming on Capital FM that she
  doesn’t have a birthday. She is hardly the first diva to deny ageing, but I
  don’t think anyone else has had the audacity to axe seconds, minutes and
  hours. While it might prove challenging for students of physics, I love this
  for her – and for us. We are making heavy weather of ageing. Everywhere I
  look, I’m assailed with questions and commandments about how to “age well”:
  build muscle, quit booze, sleep longer, eat ferments, stand up, walk fast,
  squat deep, jump around (the longevity benefits of the hokey cokey are
  unconfirmed). I know that goes for everyone – our society is solipsistic and
  obsessed with wellness – but it seems to apply doubly when you hit midlife,
  presumably because the older worried-well, feeling the chilly whisper of
  mortality, are a great demographic to target. HTSI, the expensive fripperies
  section of the Financial Times, recently launched a “longevity project”
  (hardly necessary for its readership, given that being rich already adds nine
  years on to your life). I took its quiz to assess how well I’m ageing (which
  is surely the most depressing summer magazine quiz ever: “Mostly D? You’re
  staggering to an early grave”) and it suggested I cut out takeaways and eat
  more slowly, targeting my only remaining pleasures: tearing through food like
  a famished raccoon and not cooking. I thought I was fine with ageing, but,
  eight months after turning 50, the facts suggest otherwise. My breakfasts look
  like sweepings from the bottom of a hamster cage; I take multiple supplements,
  I worry about my bone density and blood pressure and I try to “lift heavy”.
  Sometimes, as my husband and I pass each other the vitamin D spray (may slow
  biological ageing) in the morning before brushing our teeth, eyes closed,
  balanced on one leg, (doing it for longer predicts survival), I remember
  wistfully the gin-sodden nights and croissant breakfasts in bed of our youth.
  I don’t truly believe I can delay decrepitude, but I seem to have become a
  low-budget version of the immortality bro Bryan Johnson anyway. Deluged with
  anxiety-inducing messaging, I’m spending my finite days planking,
  pulse-soaking and fretting rather than living. I’m doing it because I’m a
  craven rule-follower; plenty of people manage to ignore this noise and live
  outward-looking, exciting, second acts. But it’s also because the other
  options – getting weak or sick, burdening my kids and, yes, death – are worse.
  But here, finally, is my philosopher queen with a third way. I can’t possibly
  tell you how old Carey is, but having been born in 1969 to my 1974, she looks
  like a superior species: glossier, happier, thriving. It’s possible, I
  suppose, that “not acknowledging time” involves a punishing diet and exercise
  regime, but I don’t believe it. Carey isn’t sprinkling ground hemp seeds on
  her unsweetened porridge and taking her statins before going to power pump
  basics – she is too fabulous for that (and probably asleep: she cancelled
  mornings, too). She is also still having fun, as the Bazaar interview surely
  proves. You wouldn’t want to overuse the question: “What would Mariah do?” It
  could get lesser mortals arrested. But I think, now and then, as I’m dully
  dithering over cholesterol in coconut yoghurt or whether I need more cardio, I
  may whisper it to myself. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist
