  In a cavernous concrete warehouse on an industrial estate outside Margate in
  Kent, an enormous screen flickers, day and night, telling the times of train
  services from north London to Manchester Piccadilly and Glasgow Central and
  Tring. Whether or not anyone is there to see it, the 22-metre-wide board never
  stops flashing up live, genuine updates of departures by West Midlands Railway
  or service disruptions on Avanti West Coast services. This, until recently,
  was the main departure board of Euston station, one of the capital’s busiest
  mainline railway hubs. And although it now hangs 80 miles from its original
  home, where no one has any ability to jump on a train to Watford Junction or
  anywhere else, it is still plugged into the national network and doing its old
  job, like a nostalgic retiree unable to let go. It’s a surreal sight in an
  eccentric place – part storage facility, part private museum – which is home
  to a collection of trains, models and memorabilia now in the care of the
  multimillionaire asset manager, rightwing political donor and self-confessed
  railway nut Jeremy Hosking. As well as restoring and giving a home to old
  locomotives, carriages and scale models, Hosking part-owns Crystal Palace
  football team, a luxury hotel in Sussex and Britain’s only private train (even
  the royal family don’t own theirs). In addition, he has invested more than
  £100m in fossil fuel interests, was the sole funder of Laurence Fox’s Reclaim
  party, and this week confirmed he was backing a £100m bid to buy the Daily
  Telegraph. It’s quite the investment portfolio. Given his lifelong love of
  trains – which he calls “childhood obsession meets midlife crisis” – and deep
  pockets, Hosking was an obvious person to approach to take the 25-year-old
  Euston board when it was replaced by Network Rail in 2022. Unlike several
  museums, he said yes. But his offer to house it was, it transpires, based on a
  major misunderstanding. The businessman revealed to the Guardian that he
  thought he was getting the original, analogue 1960s display board, which
  operated on the clacking “split flap” mechanism once common at airports and
  railway stations, rather than a 20-year-old board with LED lights. “It still
  wouldn’t have been an antique, but it would have been the authentic, late 60s,
  white-hot technology of its day,” said Hosking. “And actually, what we’ve got
  is the white-hot technology of 2003.” Was that a disappointment? “To have
  given house room to the wrong departure board? Yes! But hopefully in decades
  to come, people will come to regard this board in a similar way,” he said. He
  may be right, given the vexed saga of Euston’s departure displays since. The
  board’s removal was part of a plan to address overcrowding at the notoriously
  dysfunctional station, but its replacement by multiple smaller information
  points – and one huge advertising board – caused such fury that it prompted
  the then transport secretary, Louise Haigh, to demand the changes be reversed.
  No such drama in Margate, where the departures board now hangs quietly above a
  collection that includes multiple steam and electric locomotives, the 1830s
  Broadstairs horse-drawn mail coach, an original 1990s Channel tunnel train,
  complete with onboard Passport Office facilities that were never used, and an
  exquisite art deco “Beavertail” observation car commissioned to mark the 1937
  coronation of George VI. The Margate warehouse was previously a storage space
  for the model train manufacturer Hornby, which operates a small visitor
  attraction from its former factory next door. Though Hosking has spent huge
  sums to make his site fully accessible to visitors, there are no current plans
  to open it to the public regularly, according to Frank Martin, the former
  Hornby CEO who now runs the businessman’s Locomotive Services Group, which
  also operates a number of heritage lines around the country. Next weekend,
  however, both will open their doors for a weekend marking the 200th
  anniversary of the modern railway, and visitors can, if they wish, relive the
  experience of pacing in front of the Euston board harrumphing over delays at
  Crewe. It is left to flicker constantly with live information, said Martin,
  “because every time you switch it off and switch it on again, you stress the
  electrical components. So in order to keep it running for the longest possible
  time, it’s better to leave it switched on, just ticking away in the
  background.” The fact that it still showing live information, he said, “means
  that it’s been kept alive. It sounds a bit emotional, but it’s been kept alive
  – and the alternative was for it to be scrapped and lost.”
