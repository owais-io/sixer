  The Pentagon is recruiting civilian employees to join Donald Trump’s mass
  deportation campaign and asking staff to sign up for deployments to
  immigration enforcement facilities across the United States. The defense
  department has posted a job listing requesting volunteers for civilian federal
  employees apply to join a “volunteer force” supporting Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations. On
  Wednesday, the department reportedly emailed civilian employees asking them to
  take up this opportunity. “The Secretary of Defense has authorized DoD
  civilian employees to participate in details to the Department of Homeland
  Security to contribute to its operations along the Southern Border and its
  internal immigration enforcement activities,” reads the email, obtained by
  404Media. Roughly 950,000 civilian employees work for the Pentagon. Selected
  employees will reportedly “offer critical support” to Ice and the border
  patrol “as they fulfill the President’s intent to ensure a safe and orderly
  immigration system”. A US defense official confirmed the initiative, telling
  the Guardian: “The Secretary of Defense memorandum signed on Jun 1, 2025,
  ‘Detailing of Department of Defense Civilians Employees to Support the
  Department of Homeland Security’ allows DoD civilians employees to participate
  in a detail for up to 180-days, supporting the Department of Homeland
  Security’s operations on the southern border.” The official said volunteer
  duties may include “data entry, operational planning support, processing and
  throughput logistics, and logistical support”. The job posting warns
  deployment locations “are not negotiable” and conditions “could be austere”.
  Assignments last up to 180 days at facilities along the border and throughout
  the US interior, and detailing means the staff keeps their salary and
  benefits. The recruitment effort stems from a June memorandum issued by the
  defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, that authorizes the civilian employee
  deployments “in support of the President’s priority of securing our borders”.
  The memo specifically enables both reimbursable and non-reimbursable details
  to DHS for southern border operations and “internal immigration enforcement”.
  The Pentagon initiative comes as the Trump administration works to expand
  immigration enforcement personnel, infrastructure and operations across the
  country. The Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by Trump last month, includes
  budget for an additional 10,000 Ice agents, and Ice is reportedly offering
  signing bonuses of up to $50,000 and has reduced its age requirements in an
  effort to expand its forces. Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported
  that DHS had reassigned dozens of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema)
  employees to Ice. Meanwhile, new detention facilities are being established in
  Nebraska, Florida and at military installations including Fort Bliss in Texas,
  which now houses migrants in tent structures with capacity for 5,000 people.
  Ice arrests have surged nationwide, with northern California seeing a 123%
  increase in detentions between January and July compared to late 2024. The
  administration has also begun deploying Ice agents alongside local police for
  routine traffic enforcement. In Washington DC, federal immigration agents now
  accompany police officers during moped traffic stops targeting food delivery
  drivers, most of whom are from Central or South America, according to
  reporting from the Washington Post. The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, announced
  last week that approximately 1.6 million undocumented immigrants had left the
  US during her first 200 days in office, citing agency data. There is also a
  planned $20-50m ad buy dubbed “Stronger Border, Stronger America” to promote
  the work of the DHS set to launch in September. The salary range for the
  volunteer positions spans from approximately $25,684 to $191,900 annually,
  with assignments requiring 76% or greater travel and no remote work options
  available, according to the job listing. Relocation expenses will not be
  reimbursed. The Pentagon declined to specify how many civilian employees are
  expected to participate in the program.
