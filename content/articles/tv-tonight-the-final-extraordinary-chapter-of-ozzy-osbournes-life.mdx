  Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home [See footnote] 9pm, BBC One More than 20 years ago,
  Ozzy Osbourne and his family changed TV for ever with their fly-on-the-wall
  reality series. A reboot – Home to Roost – was announced back in 2022 and the
  cameras followed the gang again for three years. But Ozzy’s health continued
  to decline and, just days after a defiant final homecoming concert with Black
  Sabbath last month, the Prince of Darkness died aged 76. The footage has been
  reworked as a one-hour documentary and is a special ode to the last chapter in
  the icon’s life, as he moves back to England with the family, battles illness
  and readies for a performance that will go down in history as the greatest
  goodbye in rock’n’roll. Hollie Richardson Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy
  9pm, ITV1 This documentary – updated since it aired in the US earlier this
  year – has the latest details in the case of the Friends actor’s death by
  ketamine overdose (five people have been charged in connection: three have
  pleaded guilty; two deny all allegations). It only scratches the surface of
  telling Perry’s story before the tragedy, but his onscreen mother, Morgan
  Fairchild, shares her memories, while the Hollywood Reporter’s Deborah Walker
  paints a picture of the world of fame in which he struggled. HR Fake Or
  Fortune? 8pm, BBC One If you’ve ever wished that Antiques Roadshow was 500%
  more stressful, Fiona Bruce’s other gig might appeal. This revisited episode
  is about a painting bought for £2,000 – and valued at £300,000. But what did
  the lucky owner of an original Helen McNicoll do when the cameras stopped
  rolling? Hannah J Davies Michael Mosley: Secrets of the Superagers 8pm,
  Channel 4 It’s tragically ironic in the light of his early death in 2024. But
  what turned out to be the final series filmed by Dr Michael Mosley concerned
  the various ways human beings attempt to face down the chaos of existence and
  prolong their lives. As ever, Mosley gets practically involved, undergoing
  hyperbaric oxygen therapy in this closing episode. Phil Harrison University
  Challenge 8.30pm, BBC Two It is still only the first round of the 2025/26
  competition, but the rivalry is intensified by a Severnside derby, as Cardiff
  University takes on the University of Bristol. In the quizshow’s 62-year
  history, neither university has ever fielded a winning team, but Bristol did
  nab the runners-up spot in 2023, making it a firm favourite to win this tie.
  Ellen E Jones Confessions of a Brain Surgeon 9pm, BBC Two A remarkable film in
  which retired brain surgeon Henry Marsh looks at his 40-year career after
  receiving a cancer diagnosis. From his pioneering work to the “critical
  mistakes” that still haunt him, he has frank conversations with his ex-wife,
  former colleagues, and patients and their families. HR Film choice Reservoir
  Dogs (Quentin Tarantino, 1992) 11.35pm, ITV4 As a tribute to the late Michael
  Madsen, you could do worse than Quentin Tarantino’s 1992 debut. He certainly
  steals the film as the psychotic Mr Blonde, with his dance/torture routine to
  the strains of Stuck in the Middle With You. But there’s a lot more to
  recommend it, from the smart if expletive-filled dialogue to the rug-pulling
  flashback plot structure, as a gang of robbers – including Harvey Keitel and
  Tim Roth – assemble after a botched diamond heist to work out who is the mole
  in their midst. Simon Wardell • This footnote was added on 18 August 2025.
  Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home was set to be on BBC One at 9pm, however it has
  since been postponed.
