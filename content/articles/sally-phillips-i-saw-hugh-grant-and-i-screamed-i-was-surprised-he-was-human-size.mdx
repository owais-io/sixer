  What do people approach you about most: Smack the Pony, Bridget Jones, Alan
  Partridge or shoving cake into Alex Horne’s armpits? I profile them as they
  come up. If it’s a man about my age, it would normally be Alan Partridge. If
  it’s a man in his 30s, it might be Taskmaster or Veep. If it’s a woman, it’s
  harder to tell. Smack the Pony seems to be having a revival among women in
  their 20s but it could easily be Bridget Jones and Miranda. It’s starting to
  happen with Austin, too, which seems to be something that families watch
  together. You had a really strong Australian accent until you were 12. Can you
  do one now? Yeah, and I couldn’t hear it! My dad worked for British Airways
  and we lived in Sydney when I was growing up. I went to Queenwood, which is
  apparently very posh – thanks British Airways. I have really, really happy
  memories of that time. But I picked up an Australian accent and my family
  really teased me about it. It took me quite a long time to get rid of it. The
  weird thing is, for a while I was quite good at accents but the one I couldn’t
  do was Australian. Can you do an Australian accent now? [In an Australian
  accent] I don’t know. I think so? That’s pretty good. When you filmed season
  two of Austin, did you show Michael Theo around London? Yes I did! Michael
  came to stay with me. He had a list of things he wanted to do. I took him to
  the Science Museum and we saw the early steam engines. He was very excited by
  that. I don’t know why we went to Clapham Junction but we did and he was
  excited by that. We went round lots of cheese shops. Ben [Miller] took him to
  Aardman, which he loved. Michael wanted to see the Tower of London and I have
  a friend who is a Yeoman Warder – a Beefeater. His wife is a special needs mum
  and they live together in the tower. They are massive fans of Michael so they
  offered to give him a personal tour. I was like, I have aced this. And he
  didn’t like it! He knew he was supposed to like it. You go on a little
  conveyor belt past the crown jewels and he was going: “Why would anyone want
  to look at this stuff?” There’s some hilarious pictures of him standing on
  Anne Boleyn’s grave, which is in an area the public is not allowed in. And
  Michael was really deeply bored and couldn’t hide it. It was very funny – he
  laughs about it now. Before he came over, he said: “I’m looking forward to
  meeting English women because they’re gracious and classy.” And then he turned
  up and met us and at the end he was like: “I think I’m going to marry an
  Australian after all.” What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a
  celebrity? The first time I met Hugh Grant was on the set of Notting Hill –
  from which I was cut, but I am on the DVD extras! The third assistant director
  and I were walking to set and the third AD said: “Do you know Hugh?” And I
  turned around and there was Hugh Grant. And I screamed! I think it was a size
  thing. He’s not particularly small but I was surprised he was the size of a
  human, I suppose. That was pretty uncool. What is the most enduring lesson
  from your time at clown school? I’ve been to lots of clown schools. They teach
  you that getting it wrong means you are getting it right. When you get
  something wrong, you seem vulnerable and people can connect with you. Showing
  your vulnerabilities is actually what everyone’s desperate for and you make it
  possible for other people to show their vulnerabilities. In jazz, they say if
  you just hold the wrong note it becomes right – I think we all need to hear
  that sometimes. I did a clown workshop recently and they applauded every time
  someone messed up. “This is how to live,” I thought. When you are rewarded
  with laughter and applause for how stupid you are – life would be much better
  if we could just do this. Do you have a nemesis? Do you mean an actor who gets
  jobs you’d like? Because I’ve engaged with parenting like a plough engages
  with a field – it’s been bumpy. My career choices sometimes haven’t been
  choices. So there’s not really people who got the thing that I think I should
  have got. But there are people who I wish I’d been a bit more like. I really
  admire Sharon Horgan because she had the balls to just do it and not take no
  for an answer. When I came into the industry you were told no in so many
  convincing forms that now we know were bollocks. It was just completely
  accepted that women weren’t as funny as men and that women weren’t as good on
  telly. I remember pitching a movie and saying: “So this woman is not that
  attractive –” and the guy said: “Can I stop you there – this is the movies.
  The least attractive I’m prepared to go is Kelly Macdonald.” And she’s the
  person who played the part! We were just told no all the time. I wish I’d had
  more courage. I wish I’d had more balls. That’s the wrong thing to say! I wish
  I’d been a bit more like Sharon Horgan. Do you believe in extraterrestrial
  life? I believe there could be something. If there’s infinite galaxies it
  would be ridiculous to say no! What is the weirdest thing you have done for
  love? It was 29 February. My partner and I had been together about six months,
  not that long. It wasn’t a real proposal but I thought I’d frighten him with a
  proposal in the least romantic place possible. So I got a massive paperweight
  that looked like a diamond and some chicken wire and made a massive ring. I
  got a food compost bag full of jelly hearts and lots of photographs of us on a
  little washing line. We were on a train going north and, as we left Milton
  Keynes – one of the least romantic places in the UK – I said: “Please don’t
  marry me.” Probably a bit weird in retrospect. He was frightened but a bit
  touched. He kept the ring! If you could change the size of any animal to keep
  as a pet, what would it be? I’ve always wanted a monkey. My dad used to have a
  monkey before I was born – he rescued a monkey off the streets in Borneo. They
  shit orange – I remember once having one on my shoulder and it shit orange all
  the way down my back. So I think I’d shrink the monkey small, in terms of poo
  management. A palm-sized monkey. What are you secretly really good at? I was
  the most insanely accomplished 18-year-old – I spoke two languages fluently
  and I played three instruments really well. But I’m now 55 and I haven’t
  really done any of that since. I’ve just been to France and I can barely
  string a sentence together. I got the flute out the other day and it was sad.
  I used to be good at stuff – does that count? Austin seasons one and two are
  available to stream on ABC iView in Australia, and season one is on BBC
  iPlayer in the UK.
