  Washington will not lower steep tariffs on European cars until Brussels has
  introduced legislation to reduce its own tariffs on US exports, maintaining
  pressure on the EU’s automotive industry. While the Trump administration has
  agreed to lower the current 27.5% US tariffs on European cars and car parts to
  15%, details of a framework trade deal published on Thursday revealed the
  terms and conditions. Donald Trump and the president of the European
  Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the deal on 27 July at Trump’s
  luxury golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, after an hour-long meeting that
  followed months of negotiations. In a joint statement, the US and the EU
  listed commitments including the EU’s pledge to eliminate tariffs on all US
  industrial goods, and provide preferential market access for a wide range of
  US seafood and agricultural goods. The US has agreed in principle to charge a
  15% tariff on most EU imports, including autos, pharmaceuticals,
  semiconductors and lumber. US officials have suggested it could only be a
  matter of weeks before the administration lowers its high tariffs on the EU
  auto industry, depending on how long it takes the bloc to formally legislate
  its pledges to pare back tariffs on the US. “As soon as they’re able to
  introduce that legislation – and I don’t mean pass it and fully implement it,
  but really introduce it – then we will be in a position to provide that
  relief,” an unnamed US official told Reuters. “And I will say that both sides
  are very interested in moving quickly.” But the joint statement makes clear
  that EU carmakers will continue to face 27.5% US tariffs until the bloc
  introduces new laws. US tariffs on EU cars will be lowered “from the first day
  of the same month in which the European Union’s legislative proposal is
  introduced”, it says, adding that the legislation must “be consistent with
  this Framework Agreement and enacted by the necessary legislatures”. European
  leaders have some reservations. Last month the French prime minister, François
  Bayrou, described “a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, united to
  affirm their values and defend their interests, resolves to submission”. And
  the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said at a news conference earlier
  this week: “I support this trade agreement, but I do so without any
  enthusiasm,” noting the deal would have a limited impact on Spain’s economy
  given its smaller exposure to the US market. On Thursday, industry
  leadersresponded with dismay. In 2024, the EU exported €8bn worth of alcohol,
  including €5bn of wine, to the US, its main export market. The French wine
  exporters federation said on Thursday it was “hugely disappointed” by the EU’s
  admission that it failed to secure a tariff exemption for the sector in the
  US-EU trade deal. “We are certain that this will create major difficulties for
  the wines and spirits sector,” the head of the wine and spirits federation
  FEVS, Gabriel Picard, said. France’s minister for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin,
  said the government would seek “additional exemptions” for wines and spirits
  as part of the US-EU trade deal. “The agreement leaves open the possibility
  for additional exemptions and we’ll be working on them. The story isn’t over,”
  he wrote on X, adding: “I’m not saying it will be easy or that it’ll happen
  next week … defending our exports remains our priority.” Christophe Chateau of
  the Bordeaux winemakers association, said the US was his members’ biggest
  market and the tariff would be a “further brake” on sales. However, he said he
  was relieved Trump had not carried out threats to tax imports of European wine
  at 200%. “It could have been worse, but it’s not good news,” he added. Before
  the announcement on Thursday, the Swiss chocolate makers Lindt and Swiss knife
  producers Victorinox announced they planned to move part of their production
  to the US to avoid tariffs on exports. The Distilled Spirits Council of the
  United States also criticized the deal, noting 15% tariffs on EU spirit
  imports to the US could result in an estimated retail loss of more than $1bn
  and 12,000 jobs. “We are disappointed that this joint statement did not
  include permanent tariff-free trade for distilled spirits on both sides of the
  Atlantic,” its president and CEO, Chris Swonger, said in a statement. Of the
  27 EU member states, Germany exports most to the U.S. (€161bn last year)
  followed by Ireland (€71.3bn), Italy (€64.8bn), France (€47.1bn) and the
  Netherlands (€43.3bn) according to figures from the EU’s statistics agency
  Eurostat. Last month, the Italian Employers’ Study Centre, warned a 15% rate
  combined with a 13.5% devaluation of the dollar against the euro in 2025 would
  cause a €22.6bnbillion decline in the country’s exports to the US. “We are
  talking about 15%, but in reality the surcharge will be close to 30%,” Dario
  Costantini, president of the CNA (the national confederation of small and
  medium size businesses), said. “This is an unfair and disproportionate tax
  that penalises products made in Italy and will also have negative
  repercussions on the US economy.” Reuters contributed reporting
