  If this Clickhole article is to be believed (it shouldn’t be), California’s
  governor is looking to get a job in comedy. The reality is a bit less
  appealing: Gavin Newsom wants to be president of the U S. His office has
  ramped up social media attacks on Donald Trump, his policies, and,
  predictably, his bugnuts tweeting. I have witnessed the rise of Gavin Newsom
  firsthand: from his tenure as mayor of San Francisco to the governorship of my
  state to this deeply embarrassing photo with a future resident of Mar-a-Lago.
  At last, the world can finally see the Gavin Newsom I have come to vehemently
  tolerate – a man with a tendency to stumble into doing the right thing in the
  most annoying way possible. Newsom is the kind of politician who will seize
  the moment – legalizing same-sex marriage in San Francisco back in 2004, most
  significantly – as long as the moment is somewhere near a camera and an
  operating microphone. We are in one of those dreaded “moments” right now, as
  Texas gerrymanders itself to rig the midterms in the favor of Republicans.
  Newsom is taking full advantage, pushing to gerrymander California in response
  and turning over one of his office’s social media accounts to run a comic
  offensive against the White House. In the process, he is doing the thing I
  hate the most: weaponizing nostalgia. Nostalgia is a powerful thing, like a
  rank body odor or a French cheese. Don’t we all love turning back the hands of
  time and pretending like we still have all our hair, we can stand for more
  than 30 minutes of an Oasis concert and Twitter is a thing that matters to
  normal people? Remember 2017? That was a fun year. The Women’s March, the
  release of the original Nintendo Switch, and Montenegro joining Nato (ugh,
  finally). It was certainly a year, was it not? Definitely one of the years.
  Back then, not a minute would go by without a Krassenstein brother telling you
  that the indictments were imminent, that Donald Trump was a lame duck and the
  pee tape was just an Amazon Prime delivery away. Robert Mueller was
  practically Elvis gyrating on the Ed Sullivan Show, he was so beloved by
  neurotic liberals trying their best to white-knuckle through the first Trump
  administration. Sometimes, I’ll put on the music video for Despacito and just
  vibe on the 2017 of it all. You probably don’t even remember that song exists,
  but I assure you, it was popular once. Back in those days, we all thought we
  could mock Trump into oblivion. I certainly tried. I definitely failed. But
  thinking we could tease the man into appeasement was an amusing fantasy. Our
  first go-round with the Don was something of a satire boom – the Daily Show,
  the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, digital outlets like Crooked Media. Surely
  all we’d need to do is make fun of his tan and he’d go away, like a schoolyard
  bully with a weird birthmark. Despite the best efforts of various Ivy League
  educated wits, Trump won out with crueler insults, more banal observations and
  performative intimidation tactics that energized his base. We are now almost a
  decade into the Trump era and no one on the left has been able to figure out
  how to cause lasting damage to the Maga mystique that doesn’t involve the
  Jeffrey Epstein files. So, when I witness the numbing onslaught of Newsom’s
  @GovPressOffice account, I can’t help but be caught in a reverie that warps me
  back to the halcyon days of something resembling optimism – when “the
  resistance” was a hashtag that seemed to have actual meaning. @GovPressOffice
  is a glorious throwback to 2017. Also, 2018. And 2019. And 2020, 2021, 2022,
  2023, and 2024. Kamala Harris even tried this same tactic, trolling Trump on
  social media as often as possible. In the minds of the most die-hard political
  junkies, platforms like X are the ultimate battleground, where hearts and
  minds can be won over with a bit of sarcasm or a meme of JD Vance as a baby.
  At most, that meme might get you deported, but I’m still not convinced it can
  sway an election. Nevertheless, they persisted. It seems like any Democrat
  with a shred of national recognition immediately goes into full 2017
  “resistance” mode, hoping to trigger the right into some mythical unforced
  error of political gamesmanship. Please indulge me as I copy/paste an actual
  tweet from @GovPressOffice. Decide for yourself if you think this is going to
  sway a voter to move to the left: WOW!!! MY MAPS (THE BEST MAPS EVER MADE)
  WILL SOON PASS IN THE GREATEST LEGISLATURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD (NOT JUST
  AMERICA). AMERICA CAN THANK ME (GAVIN C. NEWSOM) AND TWO VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE –
  MAGIC MIKE &amp; RAINMAKER ROBERT, WHO LEAD THE LEGISLATURE – TOTAL LEGENDS!!!
  THESE ARE “PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL” MAPS. BETTER THAN COLUMBUS, BETTER THAN GOOGLE
  MAPS, BETTER THAN APPLE MAPS (SORRY TIM, NO GOLD BAR FOR ME, BUT I STILL LOVE
  YOU!). PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SCREAMING “MAMA! MAMA!” AND I SAY, “NO, I AM YOUR
  DADDY!!!” THE GOLDEN ERA BEGINS IN THE GOLDEN STATE, ALL BECAUSE OF ME, THE
  PEOPLE’S GOVERNOR, THE CARTOGRAPHER-IN-CHIEF, WHO WILL NOW LET THE PEOPLE
  VOTE!!! THANK YOU, USA!!! – GCN If I might go full r/PeterExplainsTheJoke
  here, the bit above revolves around the Newsom account mimicking Trump’s
  tendency to post witless threats and self-aggrandizements in all-caps.
  Meanwhile, the actual Trump, on his own social media platform, posts strictly
  within his own version of reality, where deploying the military in Washington
  DC magically stopped crime, Democrats are twirling their mustaches while
  plotting to rig elections and the Governor of California is named “Gavin
  Newscum.” Not even a clever nickname. He foolishly left “Goofy Gavin”,
  “Blabbin Gavin”, and “Gavin Nonuts” on the table, but no one in the Maga base
  cares if he’s actually funny, if he has anything witty to say. They like Trump
  because he’s authentically Trump. He is a fully realized cartoon man
  impervious to South Park episodes, name-calling and garden variety teasing.
  Half of the Harris 2024 social media strategy revolved around JD Vance making
  love to a sofa, but that didn’t translate into actual votes. I guess I can
  have a mild chuckle in between huffs of misery fumes at the depression factory
  that is 2025 America. This is not to say that Newsom is a worthless twit who
  has succeeded because of (and in some ways despite) his beautiful head of
  hair. No, he’s not worthless. The redistricting plan he’s enacted here in
  California is the only reasonable response to the escalation coming from the
  right. But what is gained from parody? What does mimicry do for the Democrats?
  It’s just another instance of the other side reinforcing the notion that Trump
  dictates the terms of engagement. There is a middle ground between “when they
  go low, we go high” capitulation and “lol I called myself the ‘CARTOGRAPHER IN
  CHIEF.’” In order to claw back authority and respectability, the Democrats
  have to stop trying to be Trump and start trying to be something else.
  Something coherent. Something relatable. Needling Trump is a great way to get
  engagement, to guarantee clicks and attention. Believe me, I know. But I’m not
  the governor of California. I’m basically a less successful, long-lost
  Krassenstein brother hoping to cash in on #resistance. Until the left figures
  out how to be something other than a pale shadow of their opponent, we’ll keep
  wishing it was still 2017. Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and
