  A 71-year-old stalker “fixated” with Anna Friel has been ordered by a judge
  not to contact the actor and keep away from the area where she lives. Phil
  Appleton sent Friel messages, turned up at her home and left her unwanted
  gifts over a period of almost three years. Appleton, from Berkshire, was due
  to stand trial and Friel had been called to give evidence, with the
  prosecution requesting that “special measures” be put in place to help the
  actor manage “fear and distress”. Special measures can include giving evidence
  from behind a screen, using a video link to make the experience less daunting
  and allowing a witness to give better evidence. However, the trial was called
  off earlier this week after Appleton pleaded guilty to stalking. Reading crown
  court heard on Thursday that a psychiatrist had diagnosed Appleton with
  bipolar disorder and erotomania, which is characterised by an individual’s
  delusions of another person being in love with them. The psychiatrist said
  Appleton would need to be monitored closely by mental health professionals and
  that he had not been able to say whether his fixation would end, the court was
  told. James Bloomer KC, for Appleton, said he had complied with previous bail
  conditions including not to contact Friel and was prepared to accept a
  lifelong restraining order. Bloomer said his client had spent more than five
  months in Bullingdon prison, Oxfordshire, and in Prospect Park psychiatric
  hospital in Berkshire. The barrister said Appleton had learned from being
  detained and was “absolutely determined” to do rehabilitative work. Judge Alan
  Blake asked probation services to prepare a report on Appleton, saying he had
  a “lack of full understanding and acknowledgment of the impact of his
  behaviour on the victim”. He said: “It is more likely [that] consistent
  treatment will help him to contain his feeling and reduce the risk of
  stalking. It is plain that, on a number of occasions, Mr Appleton has
  indicated that he does not think he is unwell or needs to take his medication
  and has desisted in so doing.” The judge agreed to bail Appleton, but declined
  to allow him to stay at an address in France, instead ordering him to remain
  at a family member’s address in Suffolk. Appleton was ordered not to contact
  Friel and one of family members and has been excluded from the area where
  Friel lives, which will be enforced by an electronic monitoring tag. Appleton
  admitted one count of stalking without fear, alarm or distress between 1
  January 2022 and 11 December last year. He is due to be sentenced on 18
  September. A website under his name appears to suggest Appleton has worked as
  an actor and pilot. Friel, 49, rose to fame as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4
  soap opera Brookside. She has been praised for her performance in the drama
  Unforgivable, which was released on the BBC last month. In the UK, the
  National Stalking Helpline is on 0808 802 0300 or email via their inquiry
  form. In the US, resources are available at stalkingawareness.org
