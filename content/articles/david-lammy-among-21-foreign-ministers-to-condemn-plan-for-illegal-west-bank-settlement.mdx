  David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in
  condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with
  the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the
  government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on
  Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that
  critics say would divide the West Bank in half. Officials then summoned Tzipi
  Hotovely to the Foreign Office in a rare public rebuke for the Israeli
  ambassador. The actions marked a further intensification of recent
  international criticism for Israel over its tactics in Gaza and the West Bank.
  The statement, which was signed by 21 countries including the UK, Australia,
  Canada and France, said: “The decision by the Israeli higher planning
  committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, east of
  Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law. We condemn
  this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms.” In
  a separate statement, the Foreign Office confirmed it had summoned Hotovely in
  a display of public criticism. “If implemented, these settlement plans would
  be a flagrant breach of international law and would divide a future
  Palestinian state in two, critically undermining a two-state solution,” the
  department said in a statement. It did not say which minister or official had
  met Hotovely or what was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not
  respond to a request for comment. Israel announced on Wednesday it had
  approved plans to build the major new block in the West Bank, with the
  deliberate intention – according to Israel’s far-right finance minster,
  Bezalel Smotrich – of preventing the creation of a Palestinian state. Smotrich
  on Wednesday called the decision to approve the settlement a “significant step
  that practically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish
  people’s hold on the heart of the land of Israel”. The proposals would extend
  the Jewish settlement of Ma’ale Adumim towards Jerusalem, further separating
  occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank, and dividing the north and south
  of the territory. The statement by the 21 foreign ministers said: “Minister
  Smotrich says this plan will make a two-state solution impossible by dividing
  any Palestinian state and restricting Palestinian access to Jerusalem. This
  brings no benefits to the Israeli people. Instead, it risks undermining
  security and fuels further violence and instability, taking us further away
  from peace.” British officials say Israel’s renewed expansionism in the West
  Bank has played a critical role in pushing them into a decision to recognise
  Palestine as an independent state. Keir Starmer said last month he would issue
  formal recognition before next month’s UN general assembly, unless Israel
  committed to a ceasefire and a two-state solution. The international community
  has also expressed outrage over Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City,
  with the UN assistant secretary general, Miroslav Jenča, warning it would
  cause “forced displacement, killings and destruction”. The Israel Defense
  Forces said on Wednesday that Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed them to
  accelerate the planned assault on Gaza City, the prospect of which has already
  prompted thousands of Palestinians to flee. On Thursday the UK was one of 27
  countries to sign a separate statement demanding that international
  journalists be given access to Gaza to allow them to cover the “unfolding
  humanitarian catastrophe” in the war zone. The statement from the Media
  Freedom Coalition (MFC), an international advocacy group that the UK helped to
  create, said: “We … urge Israel to allow immediate independent foreign media
  access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza.”
