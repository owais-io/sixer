webTitle: The most romantic place on earth? It has to be a sleeper train

  Is there anything more glamorous than an overnight train? Even when you’re
  climbing aboard wearing your husband’s raincoat, carrying an oat-encrusted car
  seat, with a six-month-old in a sling and an apple core fermenting gently and
  secretly in the side pocket of your rucksack? Not that I know of. I love
  travelling by train – even now, when it’s as comprehensively bad as British
  rail privatisation has made it for, well, just about everyone save a few
  shareholders and the CEO of Pumpkin Cafe. But travelling at night? With the
  whisper of romance in the buffet car, the flash of sunset from the vestibule
  and a white-sheeted bunk bed to call your own? I love it even more. Fourteen
  minutes before being invited on to the night train from London to Penzance,
  you would have found me in the customer lounge, eating shortbread and drinking
  apple juice like a woman who has just been told she must consume 7,000
  calories in 15 minutes or the whole of Paddington station is going to blow.
  Luckily, I wasn’t averting an extremely specific act of terrorism; I was just
  getting my money’s worth because, let me tell you, night trains aren’t cheap.
  My husband and son managed to get to Italy and back by rail for less than it
  cost me to cross the Tamar on Great Western Rail. But then again, can you
  really put a price on the extremely low-key glamour of washing your feet in
  the basin of a cabin that’s approximately the dimensions of an understairs
  coat rack but with more lighting options than my entire house? To lose none of
  your holiday but be offered a shower at five in the morning at Truro station?
  To wake up in the middle of the night and take a pee outside Plymouth at
  80mph? To get porridge delivered to your door by a woman in a bottle-green
  polyester uniform before looking out of the window and muttering “Erth?” This
  is heaven. Or as Philip Larkin wrote, probably while on the 21.19 British Rail
  service to Hull: “Here is unfettered existence: Facing the sun, untalkative,
  out of reach.” Nell Frizzell is a journalist and author
