  Struggling Thames Water has said a new reservoir in Oxfordshire could cost
  more than three times the original budget, pushing the eventual cost to be
  covered by bill-payers to as much as £7.5bn. In a blow to government plans for
  an expansion in the number of reservoirs across south-east England, the
  heavily indebted utility said a review of the Abingdon project had sent the
  estimated cost of construction from £2.2bn to between £5.5bn and £7.5bn. Last
  year Thames told the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
  (Defra) that its assessment of probable costs was “robust”. But the company
  has now told regulators that further tests, including of the ground and local
  waterways, had shown that the final bill would be more than twice, and
  possibly three times, the previous forecast. If the reservoir goes ahead,
  customers will pick up the tab. About half the costs are due to be recovered
  from Thames Water’s 16 million customers across London and the south-east,
  with Affinity Water and Southern Water customers sharing the rest. Thames
  customers already face a 35% increase in bills over the next five years under
  a settlement by the sector regulator, Ofwat, while those with Affinity face a
  26% lift and with Southern 53%. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged to
  build nine major reservoirs – the country’s first in 30 years – in her
  determination to take on “the blockers” opposing construction projects and
  renew the UK’s ageing infrastructure. In an article published in the Guardian
  this week, she said the government wanted to “break down the planning system
  to get Britain building”. Ministers have backed the scheme, which will be
  capable of holding 150bn litres of water in an area the size of Gatwick
  airport, after assessments found that Thames Water would need to find an extra
  1bn litres every day by 2050. Regulators have accepted that Thames Water would
  be unable to reduce leaks by more than 50% by 2050 or redirect watercourses to
  mitigate this extra usage as part of a 50-year plan. Last year, the Abingdon
  reservoir was designated as a nationally significant infrastructure project
  and fast-tracked through planning approval without a public inquiry. Local
  campaigners challenged the decision in the high court, but their appeal was
  rejected last month. Derek Stork, chair of the Group Against Reservoir
  Development, said Thames must have known 10 months ago when it responded to a
  Defra request for more financial details that its costs had risen steeply.
  Stork, a retired former head of technology at the Atomic Energy Authority,
  said Thames must also have been informed of the rising costs when it defended
  the civil action this summer brought by residents and the countryside charity
  CPRE. “We predicted this would happen, but even I am astonished by the
  increase to £7.5bn,” Stork said. The reservoir has proved controversial after
  Thames Water said it would need to build walls up to 25 metres high to contain
  the mass of water inside. Streams that run across the land will also need to
  be redirected close to homes in nearby villages, increasing the likelihood of
  local flooding, it is claimed. Most reservoirs are built in natural valleys or
  on substantial areas of clay, which are in short supply in the south-east of
  England. Thames Water said the reservoir remained a priority project despite
  the increase in costs. It added that flood resilience would be built into the
  scheme. Nevil Muncaster, the company’s strategic water resources director,
  said: ‘‘[Today] we published our Gate Three report for our proposed reservoir
  in Oxfordshire, in line with the regulatory process that we are following for
  its design and development. “The report marks a critical milestone in our
  development of the reservoir. It reflects the extensive work we have done to
  evolve our proposed design and better understand what it will take to deliver
  it. “Working through the development process, we are applying lessons from
  other major projects in the UK, wherever we are able. This has included
  providing an update on what we expect the reservoir to cost as early as
  possible and well before construction, when it becomes difficult to adapt to
  revisions. “The reservoir is a critical piece of infrastructure for meeting
  future water demand in the south-east and remains one of the preferred options
  in our water resource management plan which sets out our strategy to protect
  water supply for the next 50 years and beyond.’’ Thames Water has submitted
  the review amid a struggle to avoid collapse. It has amassed a £20bn debt pile
  and a deal with the private equity firm KKR to inject £4bn of funds to keep
  the company afloat was abandoned in June. The company’s creditors have put
  forward a rescue plan contingent on regulators agreeing to waive hundreds of
  millions of pounds in sewage pollution fines. This week, it emerged that Steve
  Reed, the environment secretary, has appointed City insolvency advisers to
  prepare for the company’s potential collapse into a special administration
  regime (SAR), a form of temporary nationalisation. It was also reported that
  if that situation arises, the Hong Kong infrastructure company CKI is a
  frontline contender to buy the company out of an SAR.
