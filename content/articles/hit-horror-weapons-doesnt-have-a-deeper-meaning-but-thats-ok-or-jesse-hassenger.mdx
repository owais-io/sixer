  For years now, horror fans and critics have grown increasingly and
  understandably impatient with the tendency of genre films to orient their
  scares toward a clearly conveyed central metaphor. The real monster in these
  movies is parenthood, personal trauma or that old horror-movie standby, grief.
  Writer-director Zach Cregger is no stranger to this line of thinking; his 2022
  horror movie Barbarian is very much a spooky-creature-in-the-basement movie
  for the #MeToo era. Now Cregger has returned with a movie that may well stymie
  anyone who has been trained by the last decade to search for an easy-to-track
  allegory within their viscerally depicted fears. His new movie Weapons has
  received mostly rave reviews and positive audience response. But at least a
  few critics and fans are pivoting from complaining about obvious metaphors to
  ask … is that all there is? Is Weapons actually about anything? (To further
  delve into this question, of course, we’ll need to go full spoiler mode, so if
  you want to see the movie and haven’t yet, turn back now.) The movie certainly
  alludes to plenty of hot-button issues. It springs from a chilling premise:
  one night in a small town, 17 children from the same third-grade class wake up
  at 2.17am, leave their houses, and disappear into the night. Parents are
  understandably distraught, and in looking for someone to blame seem to land on
  the students’ teacher Justine (Julia Garner), who is as puzzled and disturbed
  about this as anyone else. When Archer (Josh Brolin) angrily demands to know
  what was “going on” in his missing son’s classroom, convinced that Justine
  must have played some role in this tragedy, there are unmistakable echoes of
  social panics in an era where parents feel empowered to dictate what their
  children learn about at school. The fact that the movie’s school shutters,
  then must reopen before the disappearance is solved or its pain is at all
  healed recalls Covid-era school closures. And when Archer has a dream where he
  sees a giant AR-15 materialize in the sky above the town, it seems like an
  obvious reference to school shootings that have devastated so many classrooms
  over the past quarter-century. Or is it? Cregger actually says no. I co-host a
  horror podcast, and in our interview with the film-maker, he unequivocally
  said he was not thinking of school shootings when he wrote the movie. For him,
  that’s not at all what it’s about. (Though he did stress that he welcomes
  people’s interpretations, and in fact wanted to make something with that kind
  of flexibility.) He wouldn’t say precisely how he personally interprets the
  story, but he has mentioned repeatedly that it was something he started
  writing out of – hey! – grief, even if the movie itself may be more ambiguous
  as to its thematic aims. This leaves Weapons open to the charge that it’s not
  about much of anything – that it’s all great hook and solid technique in
  service of a thrill ride where some stray inspiration from Paul Thomas
  Anderson’s Magnolia is more superficial homage than thematic link. The real
  question, though, is how bad of an offense this is supposed to be. Plenty of
  great horror movies are principally concerned with the visceral experience of
  watching them in the dark, rather than the talking points or takeaways they
  might hand over to the viewer in broad daylight. Subtext shouldn’t have to be
  plainly visible at first glance. Indeed, some of the skepticism over Weapons
  seems to stem from the fact that it turns out to be … a horror movie. The
  children in the movie are enchanted by a witch. The movie doesn’t say whether
  she’s always been a witch, or has turned to witchcraft in the face of a
  debilitating illness. But that’s why she takes control of these children, and
  various other adults at her convenience: to sap their life force, attempt to
  heal herself, and, in the meantime, use her control to make her victims do her
  bidding. So yeah, pretty witchy stuff, and her comeuppance has the gory
  satisfaction of a Brothers Grimm story fed through a powerful amplifier. That
  wild, almost fanciful ending may strike some as reductive, especially when its
  first half plays more like a dark mystery like David Fincher’s Zodiac, or at
  least Seven. But is the spectacle of brainwashed children being turned against
  their older captor and ravenously destroying her so devoid of opportunities
  for interpretation? It’s not even that Weapons is demanding a lot of work from
  the audience – and that might be exactly what rankles some about it. Most of
  what happens in the movie is unambiguously explained; it’s the meaning that’s
  left up to the audience, and maybe some sense an incongruity between those two
  approaches. That’s a fair-enough critique, as is a thoughtful consideration
  that concludes none of the movie’s interpretations hold up to much scrutiny.
  But it’s hard to fault Cregger for making a horror movie that is more
  concerned with its own scary, twisty immediacy than its optics as a social
  critique. At the same time, maybe the discourse over the meaning of Weapons
  suggests that the eye-rolling about “metaphorror” has been overblown, too.
  Countless horror classics could very much be described as driven by metaphor.
  Some are murkier or more interpretative than others, but having a central idea
  and conveying it clearly isn’t a marker of hackdom. It’s just something that
  some hacky movies have done, often directly imitating very good ones. Think of
  Get Out, which may have been thornier than it was given credit for, but still
  has a trackable central conceit that’s not exactly obtuse; then think of
  heavy-handed Get Out knockoffs like Antebellum and Blink Twice with too much
  visible effort and too little inspiration. Jordan Peele himself followed a
  path not unlike Cregger’s when following up Get Out; his movies Us and Nope
  are immediately engaging visceral experiences with more allusions and
  evocations than clear signaling of a central metaphor. They may be more
  successful in that realm than Weapons, but then, that’s true of most movies
  when compared with Peele’s output. It’s the prescriptiveness – give us a
  meaning, or kill all metaphors – that goes against the nature of horror in
  general. The combination of the concrete and slippery is what makes horror
  such a compelling field; there may not be a genre better suited to blurring
  the lines between reality and a heightened dream state. There’s no single
  correct way to have a nightmare.
