  Donald Trump has signed an executive order instructing federal prosecutors to
  pursue criminal charges against individuals who burn American flags during
  protests. The order on Monday tells the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to
  look at cases where people burned flags and see if they can be charged with
  other crimes such as disturbing the peace or breaking environmental laws.
  Trump claimed “you burn a flag, you get one year in jail” as he signed the
  order, though it doesn’t include details about potential prison sentences.
  Here are the key Trump administration stories at a glance. Trump signs order
  to criminally charge people who burn US flag The president’s move is an
  attempt to go around a supreme court decision from 1989, when the court ruled
  5-4 in Texas v Johnson that destroying the flag is protected political
  expression under the first amendment. That court ruling threw out flag-burning
  laws in 48 states and made it clear that people have the right to burn flags
  as a way to express their political views. Read the full story Kilmar Ábrego
  García detained by Ice but cannot be deported, judge rules Maryland man Kilmar
  Ábrego García has been detained after reporting to Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) agents in Baltimore on Monday, but a judge later ruled that
  he could not be deported for now. The detainment of Ábrego, who the Trump
  administration has thrust into the middle of an acrimonious deportation saga,
  comes just three days after his release from criminal custody in Tennessee.
  Read the full story Illinois Democrats condemn Trump plans to send troops to
  Chicago as ‘unconstitutional’ Democratic leaders across Illinois and the US
  Congress are condemning Donald Trump’s reported plans to send national guard
  troops to Chicago, denouncing what they call an unprecedented abuse of
  presidential power. The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, highlighted the city’s
  recent reductions in crime and accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis to take
  over the Democratic-run city. “Mr President, do not come to Chicago,” he said.
  “You are neither wanted here nor needed here.” Read the full story Trump moves
  to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook after allegation of mortgage fraud Donald Trump
  has moved to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook over allegations she
  committed mortgage fraud, the latest escalation in the US president’s attack
  on the central bank’s independence. Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her
  that he was removing her from her position “effective immediately” based on
  the allegation from one of his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a
  second home she incorrectly described as her primary residence. The claims
  have not been confirmed and last week Cook said she had “no intention of being
  bullied” into stepping down. Read the full story Republican-led committee
  subpoenas documents from Jeffrey Epstein estate A Republican-led congressional
  committee has subpoenaed documents from the estate of the disgraced late
  financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a release on Monday. The subpoena was
  signed by congressman James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight
  committee. The estate is registered in the US Virgin Islands. The move is the
  latest twist in a flurry of events surrounding the convicted sex trafficker’s
  links to rich and powerful people, especially Donald Trump, whose rightwing
  base has long been consumed by conspiracy theories around Epstein. Read the
  full story Trump orders elimination of cashless bail in DC The president on
  Monday signed two executive orders aimed at eliminating cashless bail for
  people accused of crimes in Washington DC and other jurisdictions, an
  escalation in his efforts to take control of law enforcement in the capital
  city and beyond. Read the full story Trump wants to meet Kim Jong-un, he tells
  South Korea’s president Donald Trump said on Monday he wanted to meet with
  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and that he was open to further trade talks
  with South Korea even as he lobbed new criticisms at the visiting Asian ally.
  Read the full story What else happened today: Donald Trump repeatedly floated
  plans to rebrand the US Department of Defense by returning to the pre-1947
  name Department of War. The president first raised the idea on Monday morning
  while signing executive orders. He said the term defense department “didn’t
  sound good”, adding: “It used to be called the Department of War and it had a
  stronger sound.” Later, while taking questions alongside the president of
  South Korea, Lee Jae Myung, Trump again raised the idea. Donald Trump’s
  attacks on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) risk exposing the US
  to another Hurricane Katrina, staff at the agency have warned Congress in a
  withering critique that also takes aim at its current leadership. Some
  national guard units patrolling Washington DC at Trump’s direction have
  started carrying firearms, an escalation of the president’s military
  deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by his defense
  department. Catching up? Here’s what happened on 24 August 2025.
