  It is suddenly very important to certain Victorians that their laptops have
  playdates. Every day, the laptops will travel to a communal location, where
  they will do parallel play for eight hours before returning home again. This
  is crucial to the survival of traditional values as we know them. The
  Victorian Labor party has pushed back on this essential social ceremony. At
  the party’s state conference last weekend, Jacinta Allan announced a plan to
  protect Victorians’ right to flexible work, “if reasonable”. Essentially, that
  means people who use computers instead of hammers and Bunsen burners. Allan
  isn’t suggesting we all hang out in our PJs every day (sadly). If enacted, the
  proposal would give Victorians the right to spend three days in the office and
  two days at home (or somewhere else, as long as they have a Teams background
  that looks like a home). Sign up: AU Breaking News email This has upset
  certain people. After all, a lot can happen in two days. Chicken can go bad. A
  parcel can be delivered. Workers can defy their employment contracts and watch
  several seasons of Grey’s Anatomy. Pushback has been quick and fierce. Most of
  the criticism reasonably centres on Allan’s ability to implement it: various
  lawyers are quoted as saying it’s unenforceable. The AFR has said it’s a “plan
  built on hypocrisy”, while Sky News’ commentator called it a “stunt”. Most are
  – rightly – calling it an obvious election ploy (it would only be implemented
  in 2026, if Labor is re-elected). Less boringly, The Age referred to “the
  cynical artistry of legislating to protect something not at risk”. The
  suggestion is that Allan is campaigning to protect Victorians’ right to keep
  doing what they’re already doing. Which is wrong, but not in the obvious way.
  In 2019, before working from home was invented, as many as 30% of Australians
  worked from home. Almost a third of us understood the specific joy of rolling
  out of bed and down the hallway instead of spending 65 minutes going somewhere
  else. It wasn’t perfect. The Office People found it deeply suspicious: surely
  grown adults couldn’t be trusted to do any work unless a manager could see
  them. What if they went shopping? Played with their dog? Or simply napped all
  day? Despite a total lack of evidence, certain people pushed a narrative that
  autonomous working was a scam invented by Peter Alexander. The pandemic
  amplified both the technology and the distrust. Our primary function became
  video calling. We learnt to dress for work from the waist up. Time trackers
  went mainstream – and so did mouse jigglers. We invited ourselves to fake
  meetings so no one would see our Teams “away” status and think we’d skived off
  to a pub lunch instead of emailing. For the existing 30%, a lot of this was
  welcome progress. It was no longer weird to see someone’s pet/child/sentient
  trash pile in the background. The washing finally got done. Children saw their
  parents before bedtime. And way, way, way less time was wasted on commutes.
  But as the acute Covid threat eased, the Office People got nervous. What if no
  one ever came back to the office? What if they liked this new life? What if –
  lord mayor protect us – they never again had to choose between catching the
  train and not smelling like a toilet? For these and other – secret – reasons,
  they began to insist people return to the office full-time. Whatever their
  reasoning, they are – as ever – fighting an imaginary enemy. Remote working
  increased during peak Covid but it’s still pretty darn close to the 2019
  numbers: 36% of Australians usually worked from home in 2024 (compared with
  40% in 2021). Almost everyone still leaves their house to teach, build, cook,
  save lives, drive buses, grow food, sell mobile phone plans and, yes, type. A
  plan – however cynical – to protect flexible working doesn’t enshrine what
  Covid produced. We can never go back to what we were already doing (being the
  weird guys who knew how to use the company VPN) and the thing I want to keep
  doing is quietly typing without being surveilled. This week’s criticism has
  merely revealed that classic conservative trope: it was already happening. You
  just didn’t care until you felt personally attacked.
