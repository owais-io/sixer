  What role does YouTube play in the lives of Australian families with children?
  As the federal government plans to include YouTube in its forthcoming ban on
  social media accounts for children under the age of 16, Guardian readers
  responded to a call out about their own kids’ use of the platform and what
  they thought of the ban. This is what they told us. ‘Simply impossible to
  monitor’ Parents frequently reported they were restricting their children’s
  use to shared areas by co-watching or through parental controls. But many said
  this was time-intensive and nearly impossible to maintain and were concerned
  about which content was slipping under their radar. “We use YouTube Kids and
  always check what they watch before we let them watch anything on there. We do
  this because YouTube cannot be trusted – the algorithm leads you very quickly
  down weird or concerning rabbit holes and the messaging in a video is often
  subtle and hard to screen as a parent without pre-watching everything (which
  is not realistic). “The final reason [we restrict our children’s use] is
  because of my own experience with YouTube as an adult. I currently feel like I
  am having to actively fight against the algorithm taking me in direction I
  don’t want to go. I watch one video of a gel blaster, and I get 100 videos of
  Americans shooting guns. One video of a bodybuilder in the gym and I get 100
  scantily clad fitness models … If I have to fight this hard, YouTube would do
  the same with my kids.” Marty, father of two children under nine, Brisbane
  “Before we removed it, our children would watch YouTube for hours. We removed
  it because they would get stuck in gratification loops and jump from one video
  to the next. “I have enjoyed watching some videos with our children. Some are
  clever and very funny. But ultimately it’s too difficult to regulate, filter
  content and be sure they’re not being exposed to potentially harmful content.
  We have three boys and we’re aware that many videos contain explicit and
  implicit attitudes that young boys can be influenced by when it comes to
  women, for example.” Parent of three children who are 13, 11 and six years
  old, Adelaide “YouTube is the bane of our existence – we wish it never
  existed. Our son locks himself in his room and for the recent school holidays
  spent almost the entire two weeks on YouTube and gaming. We’ve got no idea
  what harmful content he’s seen as there always seems to be a loophole to
  internet monitoring software.” Dan, parent of a 15-year-old and a 12-year-old,
  Melbourne “YouTube provides next to no useful parental controls over content
  and the few measures they do have are next to useless (having gone through the
  whole thing very recently). While so far we have been lucky in that [our
  son’s] rather narrow focus has kept his feed relatively free of less than
  ideal content, we are always concerned that he will be served up something
  totally inappropriate.” Gerard, father of a 13-year-old, Canberra “There is no
  control over what they see. Even with strict settings on YouTube Kids, my
  child was automatically played horrific content disguised as kids’ TV.” Peter,
  father of three children who are two, four and six years old, Sydney “It is
  simply impossible to monitor the content that is being viewed but even through
  occasional glances at the feed I can tell that my daughter is being exposed to
  a lot of material with beauty/body image stereotypes, while my son’s feed
  tends to be more larrikin/sport oriented. I am also left with the impression
  that the content is rife with misinformation.” Richard, parent of a
  10-year-old and a 13-year-old, Hobart “My children are children and by that
  definition are easily swayed by bright lights and dopamine-releasing
  repetitive reward programming. My issues with YouTube is that it is used as a
  kind of poker machine to make money off of our built-in thirst for dopamine
  and we all have been sucked in. I would prefer more controls to avoid the
  rubbish while benefiting from the very good content available but alas the
  reality is that the educational stuff is not the money maker, the
  brain-draining, high energy, colourful trope is the heart of what runs this
  behemoth.” Monique, parent of an eight-year-old and an 11-year-old, Bell Post
  Hill ‘They can watch it for hours without breaks’ From fleeting attention
  spans and hours wasted to concerns about the content that can slip under the
  radar of children’s YouTube feeds, many parents felt the YouTube algorithm
  encouraged excessive use and offered potentially harmful content. “I do worry
  how short content impacts their ability to pay attention and I notice that a
  TV or a movie definitely doesn’t hold their attention for as long. We have to
  give a warning before we turn it off to manage the transition away from
  screens. Some of the content certainly seems mindless (like my daughter
  watching another child playing with dolls) but they also regularly tell me
  interesting facts and info they’ve learned on YouTube.” Parent of a
  three-year-old and a five-year-old, Sydney “The waste of time it actively
  cultivates through the algorithm, there’s no warning as to what will pop up
  next, it seems to get weirder and more extreme the longer you watch it. I have
  no faith in the tech companies caring about the wellbeing of children. I think
  they actively create algorithms that are harmful in purpose to get eyeballs
  for longer.” Alicia, parent of an eight-year-old and a 12-year-old, Colonel
  Light Gardens “If left to watch YouTube by themselves, as they have
  occasionally at friends’ houses, it is always puerile, short-attention-span
  mashup [of] rubbish or scary videos such as [the horror video game] Poppy
  Playtime, etc. Our youngest watched three hours of this at a friend’s house a
  few years ago and had nightmares for months. “I’m very supportive of the
  educational content in YouTube, but despite having free access to this the
  kids just do not seem to choose to watch it and only watch rubbish.” Damien,
  father of a nine-year-old and a 12-year-old, Sydney “It’s has been (at times)
  frustrating due to YouTube being happy to expose our kids to inappropriate
  content. Shorts is diabolical. But it has gotten better once we could identify
  our kids as YouTube users.” Matt, father of a 16-year-old and an 11-year-old,
  Ballarat Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I teach ethics at a local public
  school and in a section where we asked about a dream job about half the kids
  said they wanted to be gamer YouTubers, which is a concern, although older age
  groups seem to grow out of this. “I am less concerned about ‘inappropriate
  content’ as I am about completely valueless content, and kids don’t have the
  ability to discern the difference.” Parent of a 15, 13 and 10-year-old, Sydney
  “It’s a genuine addiction, including full-on tantrums when it is restricted.”
  Parent of a 16-year-old, Brisbane, Queensland “They can watch it for hours
  without breaks. So the rule we have now is one hour a day. Especially for my
  seven-year-old, who would immediately melt down and cry when it was turned
  off. That was a very big sign that it was not creating positive feedback to
  him. “My 12-year-old has better governance, but has on occasions been
  frightened by videos that have come up appearing to be for kids, but been
  disturbing instead ... We really hate YouTube, though, and wish it wasn’t
  there for us to contend with.” Parent of three children who are seven, 10 and
  12 years old, Harrisdale “He used to be able watch what he wanted, but he
  would only watch shorts. We found that watching these shorts all the time was
  effecting his mood. Since we limit his YouTube to more educational stuff, we
  have found his mood to be a lot more stable.” Kevin, father of a 13-year-old,
  Burua ‘He learned to crochet from YouTube’ Many parents cited huge educational
  benefits from YouTube, from supporting niche hobbies to allowing children a
  creative outlet as content creators themselves. “I am concerned about the
  level of unfiltered content he could easily be exposed to if he strayed off
  the path, but I am actually more concerned about the possibility of him losing
  access to it. He learned how to crochet from YouTube, we both learned about
  intersectional feminism and we are about to jointly learn how to weatherproof
  our flat.” Single parent to a teenage son, ACT “We use YouTube for education
  (eg Ms Rachel, how things are made, volcanoes, David Attenborough content),
  entertainment (Puffing Billy videos, music videos eg Teeny Tiny Stevies). I am
  a music teacher and use YouTube every day (online footage of musical
  performances, tutorial videos, other students playing students pieces,
  professional recordings of band pieces etc). [YouTube is] the best education
  platform in the history of civilisation!!!” Parent to a two-year-old and a
  five-year-old, Melbourne “Both my sons 11 and 14 regularly use YouTube for
  information and gaming videos. My eldest has an account where he makes videos
  about his ant colonies. He has about 100 followers, other kids who are into
  ants. I don’t [support the ban]. Many kids are just sharing their knowledge
  and passions which is healthy.” Parent of an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old,
  Sydney “Our son uses YouTube daily for his main hobby, which is stop-motion
  filming with Lego setups. He spends many hours on beautiful video clips, edits
  them and uploads the final product to YouTube where he has followers on his
  own channel. The whole thing is a really creative, productive hobby, and
  YouTube plays a central part in it.” Dan Arno, father of an 11-year-old son,
  Munich ‘If these companies will not regulate themselves then something has to
  be done’ Parents had a diverse range of views on whether or not a ban on
  under-16s from having their own YouTube accounts is desirable or effective,
  citing concerns about privacy in the proposed law alongside a frustration that
  parents were unable to protect their children from harmful or excessive use
  without more regulation. “I don’t support the current legislation at all. It
  should be biased toward making the tech companies change their content
  policies, not require more [personal identification] be uploaded to the
  internet for age verification purposes.” Parent of a 12-year-old and a
  15-year-old, Brisbane “Now I will have to put my own YouTube access into
  restricted mode to give to them access, or create a fake account, which I do
  not want to do. My partner and I will decide what my children watch and what
  social media they have access to. This is just more boomers and [members of]
  gen X making decisions about, and interfering with, things that are none of
  their business.” Parent of two children, western Sydney “Digital platforms and
  tech bros make billions out of content creators’ violent antisocial material
  and it is watched over and over by impressionable kids. Parents struggle to
  police this and the only winners are the content creators and the digi-tech
  billionaire platform owners.” Parent of a 16-year-old son, Windsor “Their
  accounts give us a history of what has been watched. [A ban is] unenforceable.
  It’s a breach of my privacy to have to register myself.” Tim, parent of two
  children, Blackburn “100% [I support the ban]. The tech companies, despite
  their protestations, have proven themselves, over and over again, to have
  little to no interest in creating a safe environment for kids.” Gerard, father
  of a 13-year-old son, Canberra “I hem and haw about it. I’m sure that the ban
  will be easily breached by the under-16s who are determined. But I also think
  that it’s, at least, some sort of proactive method to try and halt kids and
  young teens from viewing inappropriate material.” Parent of a five-year-old
  son, Adelaide Submissions have been edited for length and clarity
