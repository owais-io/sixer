  Good morning. Seen from the air, Gaza looks like the ruins of an ancient
  civilization, brought to light after centuries of darkness. A patchwork of
  concrete shapes and shattered walls, neighborhoods scattered with craters,
  rubble and roads that lead nowhere. The remnants of cities wiped out. The
  Guardian was granted permission on Tuesday to travel onboard a Jordanian
  military aircraft providing aid. Israel announced last week that it had
  resumed coordinated humanitarian airdrops over Gaza, after mounting
  international pressure over severe shortages of food and medical supplies,
  which has reached such a crisis point that a famine is now unfolding there.
  The flight offered not only a chance to witness 3 tonnes of aid – far from
  sufficient – dropped over the famine-stricken strip but also a rare
  opportunity to observe, albeit from above, a territory that has been largely
  sealed off from the international media since 7 October 2023 and the
  subsequent offensive launched by Israel. Why was this opportunity so rare?
  Following the Hamas-led attacks that day, Israel has barred foreign
  journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of
  modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been
  denied access to an active war zone. Hiroshima anniversary: mayor says Ukraine
  and Middle East crises show world ignoring nuclear ‘tragedies’ The mayor of
  Hiroshima has led calls for the world’s most powerful countries to abandon
  nuclear deterrence, at a ceremony to mark 80 years since the city was
  destroyed by an American atomic bomb. As residents, survivors and
  representatives from 120 countries gathered at the city’s Peace Memorial Park
  on Wednesday morning, Kazumi Matsui warned that the conflicts in Ukraine and
  the Middle East had contributed to a growing acceptance of nuclear weapons.
  “These developments flagrantly disregard the lessons the international
  community should have learned from the tragedies of history,” he said. What
  else did he say? Despite the global turmoil, he said, “we, the people, must
  never give up. Instead, we must work even harder to build civil society
  consensus that nuclear weapons must be abolished for a genuinely peaceful
  world.” Epstein scandal broadens as trove of letters from famous figures
  published The long-running scandal surrounding the disgraced late financier
  and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein broadened on Tuesday after the New
  York Times published a trove of previously unseen letters to Epstein from
  numerous powerful figures as well as unseen photographs from inside his
  Manhattan mansion. The letters, written to Epstein by a number of high-profile
  individuals, were reportedly compiled as a birthday gift for his 63rd birthday
  in 2016. Their publication comes amid intense speculation around Donald
  Trump’s ties to Epstein. In a letter from Woody Allen, the film-maker
  reminisced about Epstein’s dinner parties at his Upper East Side townhouse. He
  described the dinners as “well served” by “several young women”. Why is there
  so much interest in Epstein again? The renewed scrutiny into Epstein’s case
  comes as Trump and members of his administration had repeatedly vowed to
  release information related to the investigations. But in July, the
  administration reversed course, prompting bipartisan outrage. In other news …
  A nuclear submarine base in Russia’s remote far east region was damaged last
  week after one of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the area in decades,
  the New York Times reported on Monday, citing satellite images. The US senator
  John Cornyn of Texas has asked the FBI to aid Texas law enforcement in
  locating and arresting Democrats who left the state to forestall a plan to
  aggressively redraw the state’s electoral map to give Republicans an
  advantage. The New Zealand air force has evacuated three people from a US
  research base in Antarctica in a high-risk operation that required navigating
  through extreme weather and round-the-clock darkness. Stat of the day: RFK
  Jr’s health department to halt $500m in mRNA vaccine research The US
  Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday it would terminate 22
  federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, questioning the safety of a
  technology credited with helping end the Covid pandemic and saving millions of
  lives. In total, the affected projects are worth “nearly $500m”. Don’t miss
