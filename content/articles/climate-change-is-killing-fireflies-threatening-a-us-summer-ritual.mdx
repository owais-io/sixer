  Max Vogel, a 29-year-old public defense attorney, was picnicking with friends
  in early August at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York, when he noticed
  flashes of light appear in the air around him. They were fireflies,
  bioluminescent insects that the Washington DC native had not seen while living
  in Oregon, where there are few, if any. For many Americans who live where
  fireflies do, their flashing lights at dusk are a tangible rite of summer –
  though one that may now be under threat. While Vogel did not notice their
  absence out west, once “you’re back on the east coast and you see them, you’re
  like, that’s so crazy”, Vogel said. “It’s like a shooting star that just is
  surprising and gives you the childlike wonder of how you felt when you first
  saw fireflies in your yard.” Even in areas of the US where there are typically
  fireflies, people are especially excited to see them this year because there
  appear to be more this summer after a steady decline in recent years,
  according to scientists. Despite that welcome news, researchers caution that
  it does not necessarily signal a reversal of the downward trend. They remain
  concerned about the long-term viability of the firefly family, which includes
  more than 2,000 species, some of which are at risk of extinction due to
  factors such as light pollution and climate change. “It’s been really
  uplifting to hear all of the reports of huge increases in fireflies,” said
  Candace Fallon, senior endangered species conservation biologist for the
  Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. “But they are also insects, and
  insects are notorious for having populations that bounce up and down each
  year, and so it’s hard to say that their populations are increasing from a
  single year of data.” Fireflies, also known as lightning bugs, are beetles
  that come out at night during summer and produce a bioluminescent gleam,
  primarily to attract a mate. Cultures around the world treasure the bugs,
  including in Japan, where they are symbols of love and fallen soldiers. Since
  ancient times, people have also collected them, venturing out with receptacles
  on hot, sticky nights. In addition to providing a source of entertainment,
  people have also collected them for scientific purposes and profit. “Catching
  fireflies is a relatively harmless thing that you can do that really connects
  you to your natural world,” said Matt Schlesinger, chief zoologist with the
  New York Natural Heritage Program, which is participating in a project to
  identify which firefly species occur in state parks. Scientists in the US and
  Canada do not have baseline data on firefly species, which makes it difficult
  to quantify how much the population has decreased, and they must instead rely
  on anecdotal reports and documented habitat loss, which point to a downward
  trajectory, Fallon said. She and other researchers conducted a study published
  in the journal PLOS One which found that 18 species in North America are
  threatened with extinction. But the scientists also did not have enough data
  on more than half of the assessed species to determine their extinction risks,
  which means that more of the beetles could be in danger, Fallon said. The
  primary factor behind fireflies’ decline is habitat loss and degradation,
  according to the Xerces Society. That includes land being disrupted by
  development, light pollution and pesticide use. Artificial lighting at night
  makes it hard for the bugs to communicate and mate, Fallon said. Climate
  change, including an increase in droughts and rising sea levels, also affect
  firefly populations, she said. Still, there are some firefly species that
  appear to be doing “just fine”, Schlesinger said. The kinds that specialize in
  particular habitats are the ones struggling, Schlesinger said. Scientists say
  the lightning bugs’ apparent revival is probably due to increased rainfall
  this year. “If they can still have a big year, at least those species are
  probably doing fine and have the potential to recover,” Schlesinger said. That
  said, “any single year doesn’t tell you about the long-term trajectory of
  firefly populations, just like any particular year that is colder doesn’t mean
  that global warming isn’t happening.” Riley Witzl, five, was still able to
  find some in a St Louis suburb. “It was fun,” said Riley, who is entering
  kindergarten. “I liked chasing them and holding them.” Kids should continue
  the tradition of venturing out with jars in the summer but should then release
  the bugs rather than collecting them, Schlesinger said. Other ways to help
  fireflies survive include: not using pesticides, reducing artificial lighting
  at night, and allowing the grass to grow long and the leaves to pile up in
  your yard. “A lot of fireflies pupate in leaves, and so when we rake those and
  put them in bags, we’re destroying their habitat at a very small scale,”
  Schlesinger said. Despite the concerns about extinction, Fallon is encouraged
  by master gardeners in Arkansas who created a firefly sanctuary, and by
  lawmakers in Maryland who approved legislation earlier this year which
  introduces new regulations on what type of lighting can be bought with state
  funds. She thinks people are more aware of and concerned about the firefly
  population decline. “Charisma is a big part of it; people connect with
  fireflies,” Fallon said, of why people care about their survival. “I think we
  have enough time to make a difference. Even small pockets of habitat can be
  really crucial for these species. But I think we definitely need to assess our
  priorities and decide: are we going to take action?” • This article was
