  In a social media post on Sunday, Donald Trump has demanded homeless residents
  of Washington DC leave the country’s capital or face eviction, and again
  promised to use federal officers to jail criminals, even though violent crime
  in the city was at a 30-year low when he took office in January. “The Homeless
  have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform
  Sunday morning, shortly after being driven from the White House to his golf
  club in Virginia. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.”
  The post was illustrated with four photographs, all apparently taken from the
  president’s motorcade along the route from the White House to his golf course.
  Two of the images showed a total of 10 tents pitched on the grass along a
  highway on-ramp just over a mile from the White House. The third image showed
  a single person sleeping on the steps of the American Institute of Pharmacy
  Building on Constitution Avenue. The fourth image showed the line of vehicles
  that whisk Trump to his golf course passing a small amount of roadside litter
  on the E Street Expressway, near the Kennedy Center. Trump’s post promoted a
  previously announced news conference on Monday, which he has promised, “will,
  essentially, stop violent crime” in the capital district, without explaining
  how. In a subsequent post, he said that the news conference at 10am Monday,
  “will not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s
  Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness”. The Free DC movement, which
  advocates for self-determination, immediately scheduled a protest on Monday to
  coincide with Trump’s news conference. Despite Trump’s claims, there is no
  epidemic of homelessness or violent crime in the capital. According to the
  Community Partnership, which works to prevent homelessness in Washington DC,
  on any given night there are about 800 unsheltered persons sleeping outdoors
  in the city of about 700,000 people. A further 3,275 people use emergency
  shelters in Washington, and 1,065 people are in transitional housing
  facilities. Trump’s repeated claims that it might be necessary to federalize
  law enforcement in the city to make it safe also ignores data collected by the
  Metropolitan police department, released in January by the federal government,
  which showed that violent crime in Washington DC in 2024 was down 35% from
  2023 and was at the lowest level in over 30 years. “We are not experiencing a
  crime spike,” Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, told MSNBC on Sunday. “We
  have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city,
  driving it down to a 30-year low.” She added that Washington DC police
  statistics show that violent crime is down a further 26% so far this year.
  “Federal law enforcement is always on the street in DC, and we always work
  cooperatively with them” Bowser said, adding the the Washington DC national
  guard, which Trump has threatened to deploy, is under the control of the
  president. Earlier this week, Trump ordered a surge of federal officers from a
  variety of agencies to increase patrols in Washington DC, pointing to the
  assault on a young federal worker who came to Washington to work with Elon
  Musk as evidence that the city’s police force was failing to combat violent
  crime. Washington DC police, however, had stopped the assault Trump focused
  attention on, and arrested two 15-year-old suspects at the scene. Asked by
  Reuters, the White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would
  use to evict people from Washington. The president controls only federal land
  and buildings in the city. The US Congress has control of the city’s budget
  but the DC Home Rule Act, signed into law in 1973 by Richard Nixon, gives
  Washington DC residents the right to elect the mayor, council members, and
  neighborhood commissioners to run day-to-day affairs in the district. Trump
  told reporters on Wednesday that White House lawyers were “already studying”
  the possibility of legislation to overturn the law granting the Washington DC
  self-rule and imposing direct federal control of the capital. “Even if crime
  in D.C. weren’t at a historic low point, President Trump’s comments would be
  misguided and offensive to the more than 700,000 people who live permanently
  in the nation’s capital,” Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents DC as a
  nonvoting delegate in congress said in a statement. “D.C. residents, a
  majority of whom are Black and brown, are worthy and capable of governing
  themselves without interference from federal officials who are unaccountable
  to D.C.” “The only permanent remedy that will protect D.C.’s ability to govern
  itself is enactment of my D.C. statehood bill into law,” the 88-year-old
  congresswoman added. Reuters contributed reporting
