  The shadow of the defending champions, New Zealand, looms over Pool C and on
  that basis Ireland could not afford to lose. They kicked off their World Cup
  campaign with a fluent victory, in which every element of their game
  functioned well on the immaculate Franklin’s Gardens pitch. Japan won the
  previous match between these two, a 29-10 victory in 2022, and had they upset
  the odds it would hardly have represented their own Miracle of Brighton from
  the men’s World Cup in 2015. But Ireland are a different proposition under
  Scott Bemand and their physicality and accuracy, for the most part, was just
  too much for their willing opponents. Japan were outclassed and overpowered,
  in truth, but two converted tries gave their impressive supporters something
  to shout about. Some rock-solid maul defence first up showed Japan would not
  be intimidated, but the Ireland wing Amee-Leigh Costigan was soon flying over
  in the corner after powerfully handing off the Japan wing Komachi Imakugi.
  Neve Jones scored a well-taken second from a powerful maul, Dannah O’Brien
  kicking the second of six conversions, and Ireland had begun with precision
  and power. Even when the basics such as lineout and scrum are working well,
  decison-making must be on-point, demonstrated by Costigan as she timed a pass
  perfectly for her sevens colleague Beibhinn Parsons on the right. Parsons
  raced to the corner for a beautifully orchestrated score, albeit one aided by
  Imakugi rushing out of the defensive line. Such was Costigan’s organisation
  she was first there to celebrate, too. Haruka Hirotsu crossed for Japan,
  getting them on the board after 29 minutes – despite a brilliant try-saving
  tackle by Stacey Flood earlier in the move – but Fiona Tuite added Ireland’s
  fourth three minutes before half-time. Japan came out in determined mood and
  when the No 6 Masami Kawamura pushed over on 43 minutes, it seemed like
  Ireland’s defence might wilt in the Northamptonshire heat. Five minutes later,
  though, came the ultimate momentum-shifter. Japan had passed their way almost
  under the Ireland posts, bringing the crowd to their feet with an audacious
  raid on the left. But a careless pass was snatched by Eve Higgins, showing
  brilliant anticipation and vision. The inside-centre jinked away and galloped
  80 metres to dive under the Japanese posts. The conversion made it a 21-point
  game at 35-14, instead of Japan pulling to within seven. Ireland had a penalty
  try disallowed, for a maul infringement by Sam Monaghan, but they stayed in
  the ascendancy, and replacement Enya Breen added a sixth try. Linda Djougang,
  the prop, was sent to the sin-bin on 69 minutes but it mattered little. A
  quarter-final against France looks most likely for Ireland but if they keep
  improving, they will give the Black Ferns a serious test on the south coast on
  7 September. Spain are up next for Bemand’s side, next weekend here in
  Northampton, before they can prepare in earnest for New Zealand. On this
  evidence it might just be their own miracle of Brighton.
