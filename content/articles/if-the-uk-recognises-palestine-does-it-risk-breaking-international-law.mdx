  A group of senior lawyers has written to the UK government’s most senior legal
  adviser, Lord Hermer, claiming that Keir Starmer’s pledge to recognise
  Palestine risks breaking international law. Here the Guardian explains the
  Montevideo convention, which they cite, and examines whether it does represent
  an obstacle to recognition. What is the Montevideo convention? It is a treaty
  signed in the Uruguayan capital in 1933 by 19 states, all from the Americas,
  including the US, that set four criteria for recognition of a state. They
  were: a defined territory, a permanent population, a government and the
  capacity to enter into international relations. The fact that the UK did not
  sign does not mean that it would not apply to Britain, as it can be recognised
  as part of customary international law. Why do those who wrote to Hermer claim
  the UK risks breaching the convention? According to the Times, which has seen
  the letter, it says that there is no certainty over the borders of a proposed
  Palestinian state and the government would face difficulty continuing to
  recognise millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza as “refugees”,
  given recognition of statehood would mean they were in their own territory.
  The signatories also reportedly point to the fact that there is no functioning
  single government – Hamas controls Gaza and Fatah the West Bank – and claim
  Palestine has no capacity to enter into diplomatic relations (although it does
  have embassies and is party to international treaties). What do others say?
  The state of Palestine has been recognised by 147 other countries, which
  suggests they disagree. Philippe Sands KC, a professor of law at University
  College London, pointed out that in its advisory opinion last year the UN’s
  top court, the international court of justice (ICJ), recognised “the right of
  the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to an
  independent and sovereign state”. Sands said: “I have no doubt whatsoever that
  if it were asked, the ICJ would reject the argument that it is somehow
  unlawful to recognise the existence of Palestinian statehood. Palestine meets
  all the legal criteria of statehood; all that remains is a political
  consideration, namely whether to recognise or not that those criteria are met.
  The court’s language makes clear that that right exists now, and it exists
  because all the criteria for statehood are met.” Victor Kattan, an assistant
  professor in public international law at the University of Nottingham, said
  the Montevideo convention was a “starting point” but that other rules of
  international law had emerged since, including the right of
  self-determination. He said many states had or had previously had border
  disputes and governance issues. “Of course, the Palestinian Authority is not
  able to exercise all elements of government authority but that’s because of an
  occupation which the ICJ last year declared was unlawful,” he said. Who signed
  the letter to Hermer? It was reportedly signed by 40 peers, including many
  senior lawyers, among them Lord Pannick KC and Lady Deech. They are both
  patrons of UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), whose chief executive, Jonathan
  Turner, has said that neither Israel’s occupation nor its settlements are
  illegal. Another signatory, Lord Verdirame, unsuccessfully argued alongside
  Pannick, in a submission to the international criminal court, that it had no
  jurisdiction over crimes allegedly committed in the occupied Palestinian
  territories. The former supreme court judge Lord Collins also signed.
