  With all due respect to Lord Allen of Kensington, who finally took up his role
  as chair of the British Horseracing Authority on Monday promising to turn the
  sport into “a modern commercial and cultural powerhouse”, the big news of the
  past few days as far as most punters are concerned was that Ryan Moore, Aidan
  O’Brien’s stable jockey, will miss the rest of the campaign after sustaining a
  fractured femur. There is never a good time to lose your stable jockey, but
  the timing of Moore’s enforced absence could hardly be worse for O’Brien’s
  Ballydoyle yard as the 2025 Flat season enters its crucial final phase in
  Europe, the United States, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong. The seven-week
  period from 13 September, which is St Leger day in Britain and the first
  afternoon of Ireland’s Champions Weekend at Leopardstown and the Curragh,
  includes the two-day Arc meeting at Longchamp, Future Champions Day and
  Champions Day in Britain and the Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar in
  California on 31 October and 1 November. Ballydoyle is, ultimately, in the
  business of making stallions, and these are the races that will determine the
  fees on the Coolmore Stud roster when the stable’s current crop of Group One
  horses heads into retirement. The difference between a narrow success and a
  fast-finishing short-head second could equate to millions of euros over the
  course of a stallion’s stud career. O’Brien has moved swiftly to ensure that
  Christophe Soumillon will fill the gap on many of the key big-race rides, and
  he will have back-up from Wayne Lordan, the Ballydoyle No 2 and this year’s
  Derby winner aboard Lambourn, although Lordan needs to win an appeal against a
  riding ban to be available on Champions Weekend. Soumillon has been
  freelancing since losing his longstanding contract to ride for the late Aga
  Khan in October 2022, following a notorious incident when he elbowed Rossa
  Ryan from the saddle mid-race, and rode O’Brien’s Diego Velazquez to victory
  in the Group One Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville last month. He also had a
  Group One double for Ballydoyle at the Arc meeting last year, but has yet to
  ride a Group One winner for the yard in Britain or Ireland. “Christophe has
  always been [part of the Ballydoyle planning],” O’Brien said on Monday. “He’s
  not tied down to anybody now. He’s a world-class jockey everywhere, he’s been
  riding for us a lot since he’s been released. “Wayne is having his appeal this
  week and obviously Christophe has ridden a lot for us through the year – all
  those things are changing at the moment. I don’t know how long Ryan is going
  to be [out injured], but we will tell him to take as much time as he wants.”
  Among the realistic and available options for Ballydoyle, Soumillon is an
  obvious choice to step in, with a wealth of big-race experience in the major
  racing jurisdictions around the world. But he is still not Moore, who is,
  according to the detailed global rankings compiled by the Thoroughbred Racing
  Commentary, currently the world’s best big-race jockey, a position he has held
  for much of the last decade. In all, Moore has spent just over 300 weeks at
  the head of the TRC ranking system since its inception while John Velazquez,
  next in the list in terms of time at the top, was the leader for 86 weeks in
  the pre-Covid era. Moore had, it seems, been riding with an injured femur for
  a couple of months before it was finally diagnosed last week, and its origin
  remains unclear. O’Brien suggested at the Curragh on Saturday that it had been
  an issue since late June, and that Moore, a keen runner, may have sustained a
  minor fracture while exercising which was then aggravated when he thrown from
  a horse and landed on his feet in early August. So he was possibly feeling the
  injury already when he produced one of the rides of the season to take the
  Eclipse Stakes on Delacroix in early July, beating John &amp; Thady Gosden’s
  Ombudsman into second place. That ride alone made a difference of around £700k
  to the UK trainers’ championship standings, in which the Gosdens currently
  trail O’Brien by just over £550k. Moore’s ride on Delacroix was just the
  latest evidence this summer – following his 12th riders’ title at Royal Ascot
  in June – that after more than a decade as O’Brien’s No 1, his pre-eminence on
  the global stage remains intact. His longevity in the Ballydoyle
  pressure-cooker, meanwhile, is also a significant achievement in its own
  right, as he has now held the role longer than Mick Kinane (1999-2003) and
  Johnny Murtagh (2007-10) put together. Delacroix is, by some way, the most
  important horse in Ballydoyle this autumn, as he is a son of Dubawi – ie an
  outcross from the Sadler’s Wells and Galileo colts that form the backbone of
  the Coolmore roster – out of the top-class mare Tepin, a winner at Royal Ascot
  and the Breeders’ Cup. He was only second behind Ombudsman in the
  International Stakes at York last month, and a victory against the same rival
  in the Irish Champion Stakes a week on Saturday could add many thousands of
  euros to his covering fee when he retires to stud at the end of the season.
  The timing of Moore’s absence is desperate for the rider himself, for O’Brien
  and also for the rider’s many fans in the punting fraternity, but for
  Soumillon, whose last Arc victory was on Zarkava in 2008 and only Breeders’
  Cup win came 20 years ago on Shirocco in the Turf, it could open the door to
  the most successful autumn of his long and storied career.
