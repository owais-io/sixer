  Pro-Palestine protesters have been banned from marching across Brisbane’s
  Story Bridge after a court challenge by police. Chief magistrate Janelle
  Brassington on Thursday approved an application for a ban by the Queensland
  Police Service (QPS), made on the basis of community safety. Brassington ruled
  that the planned Gaza march could not go ahead due to a risk to public safety.
  She said the rally would require closing all six lanes of the bridge, blocking
  emergency vehicles. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Brassington accepted
  submissions by the Brisbane acting assistant commissioner, Rhys Wildman, that
  police could not prevent people from climbing on to footpaths attached to the
  bridge. They have been closed since March for repairs due to engineering
  concerns. “My view of the situation is this, with all of the good intentions
  of the organisers … with respect, they don’t have the expertise, the
  experience of the Queensland Police Service and those that must make those
  judgments,” she said. “There is a significant risk to public safety as
  indicated by the experts in this matter.” It is the second time this year that
  a group has been banned from marching over the bridge for the same reason. An
  active transport group was blocked in May. Remah Naji, the spokesperson for
  organisers Justice for Palestine Magan-djin, said after the ruling that
  protesters planned to still “go ahead with our peaceful assembly”. “The plan
  is still to assemble at one o’clock at Raymond Park. We are going to convene.
  Justice for Palestine is going to convene, and we’re going to make a decision
  publicly over the next couple of days,” Naji said. “Personally, I’m prepared
  to do everything in my power to pressure my government to act in accordance
  with international law.” In a statement earlier this week, the police said
  they had participated in mediation with the organisers on Monday, but couldn’t
  come to an agreement. “The QPS respects the right to peacefully assemble;
  however, this must be balanced with the need to ensure public safety and
  minimise disruption to the broader community,” a QPS spokesperson said on
  Tuesday. Earlier this week, Naji said that organisers expected about 7,000
  people to march from Kangaroo Point to Fortitude Valley at 1pm on Sunday. The
  protest would completely block the bridge to traffic. “I wish it weren’t
  necessary to march across the Story Bridge, but the severity of the situation
  in Gaza and the failure of our government to uphold its obligation under
  international law make it incumbent upon us to act and hold our politicians to
  account,” she said. “Taking a group of human rights advocates to court for
  daring to organise a protest at a location previously shut down for several
  other reasons is disgraceful.” In New South Wales earlier this month, police
  sought to deny legal protection to a planned protest over the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge – but that bid was overturned by the NSW supreme court at the 11th
  hour. Police say 90,000 people marched across the bridge on 3 August, while
  organisers put the figure at closer to 300,000. Regardless, the scale of the
  turnout ranks the protest as historic, and the day went ahead without major
  incidents. In Melbourne on the same day, in contrast, pro-Palestine protesters
  were met by a wall of police in riot gear behind barricades, mounted officers
  and riot squad vans when they sought to cross the King Street Bridge. The
  court heard Queensland police had suggested several alternative routes, but
  that the protesters had decided only the Story Bridge would “bring appropriate
  attention” to the issue. Respondent Angus Scott pointed to the precedent of
  the approval of the Sydney protest. He said in that case, the court had
  decided there was no additional risk to the public from ruling in favour of
  the protest. “Whether or not the court gave the approval, there wouldn’t be a
  significant impact on public safety, because the authorities were going to
  have to respond anyway, and that’s what’s going to have to happen here,” Scott
  said. Scott also argued that several previous events had been held on the
  bridge, including after the closure of the walking paths, without issue.
  Brassington judged that there were differences in what was proposed in
  Brisbane, including the poor state of the adjacent footpaths, four nearby
  hospitals and the risk of impeding emergency services. “I simply … cannot
  reach the same conclusion with respect to the risk of public safety,” she
  said. The minister for police, Dan Purdie, said the court had backed the
  police and called on event organisers to respect its decision. “If protestors
  defy the decision of the court, it will not only put people at risk, it will
  also take hundreds of police away from responding to crime,” he said.
