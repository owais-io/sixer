  is finally getting a leg-up

  The idea that video games are not “serious things”, says Ross Symons,
  overlooks the benefits they offer to gamers feeling isolated. “One thing that
  struck me during Covid is that games were the way that people connected and
  stayed together.” The chief executive of Big Ant Studios, a Melbourne-based
  game developer, recalls when in 2010 the then opposition leader Tony Abbott
  dismissed the national broadband network as being for “internet-based
  television, video entertainment and gaming”. Symons says that dismissiveness
  of the video game industry has not stood the test of time. Last year alone,
  Australians spent $3.8bn on video games, according to the Interactive Games
  and Entertainment Association (IGEA). The sector is small compared to large
  game development nations such as Canada – but that is slowly changing. In
  2023, the federal government brought in the digital games tax offset (DGTO),
  which allows developers who make or port (develop games for systems that
  aren’t the ones they were originally on) games in Australia to claim a 30%
  refundable income tax offset. It applies to companies which incur at least
  $500,000 in qualifying Australian development expenditure and is capped at
  $20m per company. Ron Curry, the chief executive of the IGEA, says in 2020-21
  there were about 1,300 employees in the gaming industry in Australia – a
  figure which has now almost doubled. The Australian game development sector
  now accounts for 2,465 full-time workers and earned $339.1m in revenue in the
  financial year of 2023-24. “That shows an almost 100% increase in employment
  and revenue has grown about 85%,” he says. “The DGTO pulled a number of
  levers. Australia was a very expensive place to make games – we were the only
  developed country without any sort of rebate or offset. So it fixed that, so
  it brought us back in line with other developed countries.” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Curry says it signalled to the rest of the world there was
  confidence in the industry from government, and – in conjunction with state
  and territory grants to the sector – it made Australia a “healthy environment
  to operate in” and generated confidence from investors, game publishers and
  prospective employees. Interstate competition and legacy-building Serge
  Zebian, partner at Playwright Consulting, a firm that advises gaming companies
  on accounting matters, says the offset has made an “enormous difference” for
  companies hiring people in Australia and that momentum is starting to flow.
  “We’re making all the international studios aware of it, and some already are
  just from existing relationships with Australian vendors. But … now a lot of
  international studios are looking [toward] Australia. My clients’ proposals
  are progressing really fast up the queue.” Zebian says NSW used to be the home
  for film while Victoria had the reputation as a games development hub, but
  competition is increasing. Queensland has added a 15% rebate on top of the
  federal government’s 30% with a threshold of $250,000. In Victoria, the rebate
  is 10% or 15%, depending on shareholding, with a threshold of $500,000. “What
  we’re finding is a lot of indies [independent game studios] are … moving up to
  Queensland,” Zebian says. French developer Gameloft opened its Brisbane studio
  in 2014. The studio was behind the resurrection of iconic gaming character
  Carmen Sandiego this year on mobile, Netflix, Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and
  Nintendo Switch. Manea Castet, the studio head in Brisbane, says he grew up
  playing the Carmen Sandiego games with his father. He found the character
  scary: Sandiego is a thief, after all, who you have to chase all over the
  world. For Castet, to come back and be able to make the new game and have
  players instead assume the role of Sandiego was a “fun twist”. Castet says
  Gameloft’s Brisbane studio is the only one within the company experiencing
  large growth, expanding from 55 employees two years ago to 117 today. Castet
  says it allows the studio to work on two games at once and have more complete
  development of the game from design, tech, audio, quality assurance and
  marketing. “Everywhere in the world, it’s shifting … there is still a lot of
  money to be [made in] the video game industry, so having Australia pushing for
  that now, I think it’s super smart.” Development challenges Big Ant Studios
  found itself at the centre of controversy with the release of their Rugby
  League 26 game in July. Users complained about bugs in the game at launch,
  including jerseys with the wrong numbers on them and server errors making it
  difficult to play the game. Symons says it was a “very good day” when numerous
  patches were rolled out to improve the game. He blamed tight deadlines for the
  release of the game to coincide with the NRL season and last-minute changes to
  the game. “We were forced to make a hell of a lot of change in the game, 1,200
  changes in the week before we release[d], and these changes were to do with
  betting sponsors, alcohol sponsors and all sorts,” he says. “So we sat there
  stripping the hell out of the game, still having to meet our day. So that was
  tough.” Gambling and alcohol company logos that are featured on player jerseys
  in real life were removed from the game prior to release amid growing concern
  about marketing of those products to under-18s. Symons also says the company
  underestimated demand on the day the game went on sale; it sold six times more
  than their expectations, leading to server issues which he says have since
  been resolved. Big Ant had around 50 employees until the tax offset came in,
  which allowed the company to expand to 147 employees, Symons says. “It allows
  us to be competitive with every other place on the planet.” The studios say a
  tight jobs market, where games development skills are often sought out by
  other industries including artificial intelligence, makes it more difficult to
  grow. Curry says the industry is proud participants have transferrable skills,
  but it makes it competitive for talent. Secure jobs, commensurate salaries and
  an immigration system that attracts senior talent would help recruiting, he
  adds. “We know when you bring senior talent into a country, they act as an
  accelerator for those people that they’re training,” he says. “If you want to
  get a developer into Canada, you can do it in as little as two weeks through
  their system. We know people have taken up two years and beyond to get into
  Australia.” “That just doesn’t work when you’re in a field that’s quickly
  moving.” • This article was amended on 18 August 2025. GameLoft initially said
  its Brisbane Studio had 217 employees but later clarified that figure to 117.
