  Taniela Tupou let the tears flow. Months before, the Wallabies prop wondered
  if he had forgotten how to play the game. The Tongan Thor had been reduced to
  mortality of late, injuries and errors clouding his mind and finding him
  exiled by Test selectors. Now he was arm-in-arm with his brothers, singing the
  Australian anthem in the gold jersey for likely the final time before 80,312
  fans. Why not let a few fat salty ones break their moorings? After all,
  occasions did not get much bigger. A full house at Sydney’s old Olympic
  stadium. The British &amp; Irish Lions were chasing history – back-to-back
  series victories for the first time since 1989 and a 3-0 sweep of Australia, a
  feat of domination not achieved since 1904. The Wallabies wanted respect –
  proof they are still a rugby power despite slipping to No 6 in the world
  rankings and revenge for a controversial defeat in the 80th minute of the
  second Test last week. Against the odds, Australia did it. In driving rain and
  swirling winds they brought the thunder, dominating the Lions from the outset
  to run out convincing 22-12 winners. Given the shattering defeat last week,
  this was one of Joe Schmidt’s greatest triumphs. Somehow he picked his broken
  men off the canvas of the MCG, shrugged off the loss of their best player, Rob
  Valetini, and swung a series of inspired team changes driven by heart not
  head. Such daring inspired a victory full of grit, aggression that pegged the
  series back to 2-1. In the elevator up to the packed rafters, Adam
  Ashley-Cooper – who scored a try to secure a decider in the 2013 series – had
  offered his Wallabies scarf to a young fan in a Chicago Bulls hoodie. The kid
  handed it back. For Australian rugby it had been that sort of week. After
  watching their side surge to a 23-5 lead only to get run down at the death,
  fans had had to grapple with another opportunity squandered and the ignominy
  of not forcing a decider. “It’s the only time in my coaching that I’ve circled
  up the players on the field. They looked so forlorn out there,” Schmidt said.
  “[But] I think we can get our spark back.” To do so, he confounded everyone by
  lapsing into what many regarded as sentiment, recalling Tupou from his
  doldrums and handing a final Test to the 35-year-old spark-plug half-back Nic
  White. Tupou’s emotion before kick-off was echoed in a roaring crowd dominated
  by red, but riven by gold. As lightning crackled in the distance, Angus and
  Malcolm Young – who grew up 3km from here – lit the fuse with Hells Bells over
  the PA. The heavens soon opened. Worms emerged and turned. Despite the Lions
  fielding their strongest team of the tour, Australia started faster and
  harder. Will Skelton, all seven feet and 140kg of him, scruffed Jamison
  Gibson-Park and grinned. It was a declaration of war. The Australia forwards
  barrelled upfield then spun it wide where the Wiradjuri winger Dylan Pietsch
  speared into the corner. First blood on the scoreboard was important, but
  seeing the real thing was more important for home fans. When the captain,
  Harry Wilson, copped hooves on the deck in the 22nd minute, White bristled
  like his moustache and went into fighting bantam mode. Skelton rumbled in and
  Len Ikitau followed. Punches flew and fire met brimstone. No cards were shown,
  but when the dust finally settled, the Lions knew they were in for the fight
  of their life. By the time an electrical storm delayed play, the casualty ward
  was full, with Maro Itoje and Tom Lynagh suffering concussions and Tommy
  Freeman leaving the field on a medi-cab. White was bandaged up, but kept
  bouncing. Australia followed his lead for the rest of the game, staying true
  to their DNA to attack from all quarters. Three times the Wallabies spurned
  easy penalty goals to chase tries. Their courage was rewarded, all while
  defending their line with steely determination. In Brisbane, they missed 29
  tackles, another 23 in Melbourne. Here, they aimed up, hitting hard and often,
  hurting the Lions runners over and over. For Rugby Australia, as for Schmidt
  and his players, this win is bittersweet. Even without a live decider, the
  40,000 Lions tourists in town will probably clear their Aus$38m (£18.5m) debt
  and set up the “golden decade” of the men’s World Cup in 2027, the women’s RWC
  in 2029 and the Brisbane Olympics in 2032. But for Wallabies fans, starved of
  success for so long, the only currency worth a damn on Saturday was winning.
  This victory, along with highest attendances for a Lions tour , is worth its
  weight in gold. For too long, the Wallabies have been a rocks and diamonds
  side. Now they can march into the Rugby Championship this month battle-fit and
  full of beans. If they can shock the Springboks draw that series, sails will
  be full for a sweep of Argentina in two home Tests before a tilt at the All
  Blacks. With all credit to the Lions, bringing home the Bledisloe Cup after 23
  years is Schmidt’s priority. History is written by the victors and the
  Wallabies, with pride salvaged, must keep winning or risk losing fans like
  tears in rain.
