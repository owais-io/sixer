  Ion Iliescu, who has died aged 95, served three terms as the elected president
  of Romania, setting one of the best examples in Europe of how former communist
  leaders could support democratic reforms and maintain social stability in
  their countries when the old system of repressive one-party rule crumbled.
  Iliescu had revealed himself as a progressive during the harsh dictatorship of
  Nicolae Ceaușescu. He was appointed head of the Communist party’s agitation
  and propaganda department in 1965, the year that Ceaușescu became party
  leader. For more than a decade Iliescu served him loyally but gradually became
  disillusioned by Ceaușescu’s megalomania. Iliescu did not hide his views and
  he was forced to accept a series of minor jobs in provincial cities, though he
  was able to remained a member of the party’s central committee. In 1984 he
  suffered his final demotion by being given the post of running a technical
  publishing house. There he could have remained, in obscurity, like many other
  minor party officials from modest backgrounds. Iliescu was born in Oltenita, a
  small southern town on the Danube. His father, Alexandru, was a railway worker
  who supported the banned Romanian Communist party and was imprisoned for four
  years during the second world war. His mother, Maria, was a Roma who left when
  Ion was an infant, and he was brought up by his stepmother and grandparents.
  He studied engineering for four years at the Moscow Power Engineering
  Institute. Back in Romania he joined the Union of Communist Youth in 1944 and
  the Communist party in 1953. The revolutionary year of 1989 changed the
  landscape of eastern European politics and gave Iliescu a chance to shine. The
  collapse of communism in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1989
  produced similar demonstrations for change in Bucharest and other Romanian
  cities, but unlike the behaviour of the authorities in those countries, the
  security forces in Romania were ordered to shoot protesters. In the turmoil
  and bloodshed, Iliescu emerged as a leader of the pro-reform forces. He
  founded a broad-based National Salvation Front (FSN). With the army beginning
  to split, Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena, fled the capital in a helicopter.
  They were captured, held at an army base and then shot. Iliescu went on
  national TV to “salute the popular movement” and promise free elections,
  political pluralism and market reforms. As leader of the FSN, Iliescu had
  authorised the execution of the Ceaușescus. He admitted it in his memoirs,
  saying he later regretted it. The hope had been, he said, that it would end
  all resistance to the revolution. Iliescu was named Romania’s interim
  president in December 1989. Apparently shocked by the Ceaușescus’ death, his
  new government abolished capital punishment. In the chaos of the unexpected
  collapse of the old system, class tensions were high, and there were fierce
  debates over whether to reprivatise state enterprises and put former
  communists on trial, or at least bar them from public leadership roles. The
  Communist party was dissolved and Iliescu left the FSN. He founded the Social
  Democratic party in a clear sign that he hoped to replace traditional Romanian
  authoritarianism with Scandinavian-style politics. It was an uphill struggle.
  In the days after the Ceaușescus’ execution more than a thousand people were
  killed in clashes with the security forces. Street protests against Iliescu’s
  government were constant and in May 1990 Iliescu called on hundreds of
  leftwing miners to be bussed to Bucharest to break up the protests. The bloody
  clashes that ensued were called the Mineriads. In spite of the violence,
  Iliescu remained popular and in June 1990 he won a staggering result, securing
  85% of the vote for the presidency. The issue of blame for the
  post-revolutionary violence continued to fester for decades. In 2018
  prosecutors indicted Iliescu for “crimes against humanity” over the deaths in
  the clashes that followed the Ceaușescus’ execution. In a separate case he was
  charged with orchestrating the miners’ violence in 1990. Both sets of charges
  were ultimately dropped. In 1996 Iliescu narrowly lost the presidential
  election to Emil Constantinescu, a professor of mineralogy who had been a
  leader of the street protests in 1990 that the miners broke up. He represented
  the centre-right of Romania’s new politics, which favoured the rapid
  privatisation of the country’s state-run economy. He had come second to
  Iliescu in the presidential race of 1992. His promises of rapid economic
  progress won more support from voters in 1996. Iliescu lost the election but
  stepped down with dignity. It was the first time in eastern European politics
  that a former communist leader had accepted electoral defeat. But
  Constantinescu’s period in power disappointed his supporters. His promises of
  economic advancement came to nothing, and in the 2000 election Iliescu made a
  comeback. Constantinescu’s legacy on foreign affairs was more successful than
  his policies on domestic issues. He pressed for Romania’s membership of the
  European Union and Nato. This pleased western governments who remained wary of
  Iliescu. But Iliescu had changed his views and when he resumed power in 2000
  he continued the movement towards Romania’s membership of the Euro-Atlantic
  club of Nato and the EU. His term in power ended in 2004 and he largely
  retired from public life. In a brief statement in May this year he
  congratulated Nicușor Dan, Romania’s new centre-right president, on his
  election victory. He is survived by his wife, Elena (nee Șerbănescu), whom he
  married in 1951. • Ion Iliescu, statesman, born 3 March 1930; died 5 August
