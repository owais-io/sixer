  The surrealist worlds of choreographer Léa Tirabasso are not immediately
  readable to the average audience member (that’s a polite way of saying: what
  on earth is going on here?!) but Tirabasso has decided she wants you to know
  what she’s on about. Queueing for her latest show, In the Bushes, we’re given
  a handout of an interview where the French choreographer cites her influences,
  from Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle to Henry Gee’s The Accidental
  Species. It’s the idea of human exceptionalism that’s at the heart of her
  thinking: we’re just animals, she says. What makes us think we’re above the
  rest of our kingdom? And if you take away society’s manners and constraints,
  who are we then? What goes on in the bushes when nobody’s looking? In truth,
  the appearance of the six dancers is less animal, more like a bunch of
  toddlers who’ve been let loose in the dressing up box, tottering about on
  tippy toes, squawking and cooing and twittering. They come across like
  Teletubbies (you might find this irritating, or hilarious). She paints us as
  simplistic beasts, sensory-seekers, rolling on the floor, rubbing against each
  other, doing what feels good. There’s naivety and lack of embarrassment about
  bodies – it brings to mind Emma Stone in the film Poor Things, especially
  later when things get a bit less naive with biting hands, slapping bottoms and
  giggly kisses. But then there’s the intrusion of shame, fear, and innocence
  lost. Nakedness and the dawning of self-consciousness. These parts are
  cleverly, amusingly done, along with the creeping in of rituals, for the dead,
  for example – something that’s been observed in animals, too. The climax is a
  huge outpouring of fake emotion. The dancers play at being distraught, tears
  dripped from a water bottle, revelling in the big feels, even when they’re
  completely fabricated. This surely is a true marker of human behaviour – what
  else do we use art for, if not to fabricate emotions? The emotions produced
  here seem fairly surface level. It’s a funny and silly piece of dance, even
  though it’s also deeply concerned with the very nature of who we are. They are
  a truly impressive clan of performers, to keep up this level of jittery,
  full-body energy and intense character for a constantly moving hour. Humans
  are often enthralled to watch animal behaviour that we don’t necessarily
  understand, and this is not dissimilar. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25
