  A Scottish schoolgirl has been named a “girl of the year” by Time magazine
  after she invented a solar-powered thermal blanket to help rough sleepers keep
  warm. Rebecca Young, 13, came up with her design after seeing homeless people
  struggling in subzero temperatures on the streets of her home city, Glasgow,
  in winter. She said her message to young people was: “If you see a problem you
  think you can fix, you can do something about it.” She joins nine other girls
  from across the world on the magazine’s first list to spotlight girls’
  achievements. It builds on Time’s existing women of the year list, with the
  express intention of recognising young female role models globally. Rebecca’s
  design – a solar-powered backpack with an electric blanket inside – won an
  engineering award in a UK-wide competition that received 70,000 entrants and
  Rebecca has since developed it as a prototype. The engineering firm Thales,
  which sponsored the competition, subsequently manufactured 30 of the blankets
  and distributed them to six homeless charities in Glasgow earlier this year,
  with plans to make 120 more. Rebecca, a student at Kelvinside academy, said:
  “The idea came from seeing how hard it is for people living on the streets of
  Glasgow, especially during winter, and wanting to create something that could
  make a real difference. At first, it was just a drawing – I never imagined it
  would actually be made.” “Knowing that something I came up with is helping
  others makes me feel really proud. By seeing themselves as builders, girls can
  challenge norms, pursue any passion and shape the world. It’s easy to fall
  into thinking that building just means construction. It’s so much more than
  that.” The list is launched in partnership with Lego Group, as an extension of
  their She Built That campaign, which challenges stereotypes and encourages
  girls to see themselves as builders. Other entrants on the list include
  Rutendo Shadaya, a 17-year-old Zimbabwean-New Zealander fantasy novelist, the
  Olympic skateboarder Coco Yoshizawa, 15, from Japan and an organ donation
  advocate, Naomi S DeBerry, 12, from the US. Nine of the 10 girls are
  reimagined as Lego figures on the cover of the new edition. Launching the
  list, the Time senior editor Dayana Sarkisova said: “These girls are part of a
  generation that’s reshaping what leadership looks like today. Their generation
  understands that change doesn’t require waiting for adulthood – it starts with
  seeing problems and refusing to accept them as permanent.” Rebecca said: “I
  think there’s a really important message for any young person to look at what
  you’re interested in and follow your dreams If you see a problem you think you
  can fix or contribute to, you can do something about it. And whatever you do,
  you should always follow your own path to what you want to achieve.”
