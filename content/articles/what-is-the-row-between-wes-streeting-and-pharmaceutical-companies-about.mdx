  Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has accused pharmaceutical companies of
  being “shortsighted” and undermining their relationships with the government
  after the two sides failed to come to an agreement last week, but what is the
  row all about? Why are the health secretary and the pharmaceutical industry at
  loggerheads? The dispute is over the financial terms for drug companies to
  provide medicines to the NHS, including potentially life-saving cancer drugs.
  In 2023, the government, NHS England and the Association of the British
  Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) made a five-year deal that included drug
  companies paying a percentage of their income on sales to the NHS above a
  certain threshold. This was about 15%, but this year it rose unexpectedly to
  almost 23%. What is the purpose of this system? It has been called a “clawback
  tax” and was intended to “promote innovation and access to cost-effective
  medicines … while also supporting the sustainability of NHS finances”, the
  agreement states. It essentially prevented drug companies from making runaway
  profits. The idea was to use a voluntary pricing scheme to ensure a
  “partnership approach” between the drug companies and the health service. It
  was “designed to balance medicines’ costs for the NHS while encouraging growth
  and investment in the UK pharmaceutical industry”, said Doina Ionescu, Merck’s
  general manager for healthcare in the UK and Ireland. Why has the clawback
  rate increased and what has been the consequence? There have been rising sales
  of newer drugs to the health service, increasing from £6.9bn, when the
  percentage was originally set, to £8.4bn, according to the government’s
  figures. The government thinks this means there could be a £373m underpayment.
  It says the new rate is in line with the terms of the original agreement.
  However, some drug companies now say it is not worth their while to launch as
  many new medicines for use in the UK. They say the clawback rates are far
  lower in Ireland, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Belgium. What kind of
  drugs might this affect? Peter Wickersham, the general manager for the UK and
  Ireland of Gilead Sciences, one of the world’s largest drug firms, said at the
  weekend that the UK government’s approach means its Trodelvy drug for a form
  of breast cancer will not now be made available to people in England for one
  form of the disease. The ABPI says it is directly affecting NHS patient access
  to new medicines in disease areas such as cancer and contributes to the UK’s
  poor performance in international comparisons of treatable and avoidable
  mortality. But aren’t drug companies hugely profitable? They are. The biggest
  firms make billions of dollars in profits every quarter. But they say that
  unless the terms are changed to bring them closer into line with other
  countries in which they can choose to operate, fewer medicines will be
  launched for use in the UK and patient outcomes could decline. Those that
  supply the US are also facing pressure from the US president, Donald Trump, to
  cut prices, which means they face falling revenues from a major market. What
  is happening in the dispute now? Talks over a review of the scheme – which was
  due to run to 2028 – broke down on Friday after the pharmaceutical industry
  rejected Streeting’s pricing offer as “unsustainable”. There is now a
  stalemate. The ABPI said: “We need to reach a solution that improves patient
  access to future innovation, allows the sector to fulfil its growth potential,
  and does not require industry to pay back nearly three times as much of its
  revenues as is required in other European countries.” The government said it
  was “regrettable” the ABPI did not want to take its proposals onboard.
