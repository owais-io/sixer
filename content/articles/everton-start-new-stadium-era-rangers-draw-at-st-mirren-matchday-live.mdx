  That just about wraps up today’s matchday live, so there’s just time for me to
  point you in the direction of our minute-by-minute coverage. Whether it’s the
  first knockings at a shiny new stadium, or the bitter battle between two teams
  who really really wanted Europa League football, the choice is yours. Thanks
  again for ready and for all your comments and correspondence. Bye! Before the
  2pm games start, here’s a thought-provoking email from Jeremy Boyce re
  Nottingham Forest. I think I’m right in saying that one of the reasons Morgan
  Gibbs-White cited for staying at Forest was that he thought he had become a
  better player under Nuno’s tutelage and wanted to carry on. With all the
  Nuno-Marinakis carry-on carrying on, where will that leave [Gibbs-White] if
  Forest have a bad day today and Nuno’s gone in the morning ? The window hasn’t
  actually closed yet ... St Mirren defended stoutly and kept the door firmly
  shut on Rangers, securing a deserved point and, in the process, piling yet
  more pressure on Russell Martin. That’s a third successive league draw for the
  new manager at the start of his reign and the new Scottish Premiership season.
  They’ve all been 1-1. Together with their possible elimination from the
  Champions League, after a 3-1 first leg playoff defeat to Club Brugge, it all
  paints a rather ugly picture for the former Southampton coach. Next up is the
  second leg versus Brugge, before the Old Firm derby at Ibrox next weekend.
  Boos from the visiting fans greet the final whistle. Ticking towards added
  time. Still 1-1. Russell Martin watches on nervously. Nearly 78 minutes on the
  clock at St Mirren. Rangers were huffing and puffing. But substitute Findlay
  Curtis has just levelled with a fierce, possibly deflected, strike from the
  edge of the box. Now they need another. This could still really ugly for
  Martin if they fail to do so. David Moyes is chatting to Sky Sports at
  Everton’s new stadium: “It’s a day in history for everyone here. We’ve got a
  fantastic, new-looking stadium, now we need a team to match it. I’m hugely
  privileged [to be in charge] – it was regularly talked about in my first spell
  here, but things kept falling down. For me to come back as the manager here,
  it’s a great thrill for me. I’m the fortunate one who gets to lead the team
  out today.” There is extra spice to the game at Selhurst Park after everything
  that has transpired this summer, with Crystal Palace’s supporters still
  seething over their demotion from the Europa League at Nottingham Forest’s
  expense. All eyes will be on the boardroom to see if their owner, Evangelos
  Marinakis, shows up – especially given the tension between him and manager
  Nuno Espírito Santo, whose extraordinary press conference on Friday revealed
  the growing tensions behind the scenes. There is an extra police presence on
  the streets of south London for the game some are calling ‘El Casico’ but all
  seems quiet for now. Palace are planning a special display to mark their first
  Premier League game at home this season after winning the FA Cup in May and
  will no doubt have something planned for Marinakis and co too. St Mirren 1-0
  Rangers: More than an hour has passed now in Paisley and Rangers, having made
  a number of substitutions, still don’t resemble a coherent football team. The
  home side are defending quite deep but look fairly comfortable in keeping
  Russell Martin’s men at bay. Thelo Aasgaard has just scuffed a shot wide.
  Northern Ireland youngster Justin Devenny is the first man tasked with
  replacing Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace, then. How Oliver Glasner must wish
  he had some of the attacking depth available to his opposite number, Nuno
  Espírito Santo, today. He may not be so envious of Nuno’s general predicament
  at Forest, mind, but the visitors have new signings James McAtee and Omari
  Hutchinson on the bench this afternoon, along with Juventus loanee Douglas
  Luiz, formerly of Aston Villa. Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest Palace:
  Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Guéhi; Muñoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Sarr,
  Devenny, Mateta. Subs: Benítez, Matthews, Lerma, Clyne, Esse, Édouard, Sosa,
  Rodney, Cardines. Forest: Sels; Aina, Murillo, Milenkovic, Williams; Sangaré,
  Anderson; Hudson-Odoi, Gibbs-White, Ndoye; Wood. Subs: Gunn, Morato, D.Luiz,
  Kalimunedo, I.Jesus, Hutchinson, Yates, McAtee, Boly. Everton v Brighton
  Everton: Pickford; O’Brien, Tarkowski, Keane, Garner; Iroegbunam, Gueye;
  Ndiaye, Dewsbury-Hall, Grealish; Barry. Subs: Travers; McNeil, Beto, Chermiti,
  Coleman, Alcaraz, Aznou, Armstrong, Onyango. Brighton: Verbruggen; Wieffer,
  Dunk, Van Hecke, De Cuyper; Baleba, Ayari; Minteh, O’Riley, Mitoma; Welbeck.
  Subs: Steele, Gruda, Hinshelwood, Milner, Boscagli, Kadioglu, Gomez, Veltman,
  Coppola. Thanks Will. Andy Hunter checks in from his new surroundings: Just
  arrived at Hill Dickinson Stadium and first impressions (not counting the
  previous first impressions from February’s test event) are extremely positive.
  It’s a beautiful day, so that helps, and thousands of fans were here early to
  check out Everton’s magnificent new home on the banks of the River Mersey.
  There were plenty of helpful stewards at Sandhills train station to guide
  people. And hand out Everton Mints at the exit. Nice touch. It took 16 minutes
  to walk from Sandhills to the entrance to the stadium on Regent Road.
  Inevitably, there appeared to be some teething issues with confusion over road
  closures, where coaches should park and which entrances to use. There was also
  some congestion in certain parts of the outside concourse. But it is day one
  as a fully functioning Premier League stadium. The media facilities are very
  impressive – a niche point, admittedly – and the same friendly faces who
  staffed the press room at Goodison Park for years (including floor manager
  Lisa Hynds) have transferred across. Tony Hibbert is here too. A real blast
  from the past. So Everton’s new stadium is up and running. Will the same be
  true of David Moyes’ team? Well, an hour has flown by and it’s time for me to
  hand back to Dom. Enjoy the rest of the assorted vibes before things get under
  way in earnest later on. Nuno Espírito Santo has stepped over the threshold at
  Selhurst Park. No doubt he will be closely watched by the Sky Sports cameras
  today after his comments about his shaky relationship with Evangelos
  Marinakis, the club’s owner, in his pre-match press conference. Thelo Aasgaard
  and Djeidi Gassama have forced George, the St Mirren keeper, into action, but
  Rangers have failed to find a way through and it remains 1-0 to the hosts at
  the break. Martin has, understandably, cut a frustrated figure on the
  sidelines. Jonathan Rowe has signed for Bologna after being forced out of
  Marseille following a changing room fight with Adrien Rabiot which resulted in
  both players being put on the transfer list. Bologna offered no more details
  on the transfer but Italian media report that the Serie A club agreed a fee of
  €19.5m (£17m) for Rowe who has signed a four-year deal. Marseille announced
  Rowe’s departure in a brief post on their website, wishing him “good luck”.
  Rowe, 22, signed for Marseille on loan from Norwich last year and scored three
  times in 28 games in his first season in Ligue 1, before his move was made
  permanent in the summer. But the Under-21 England international was put up for
  sale on Tuesday, in the aftermath of an altercation with Rabiot which Roberto
  De Zerbi, the Marseille coach, called a “bar fight”. The brawl kicked off
  after a 1-0 defeat in Marseille’s opening fixture of the Ligue 1 season at
  Rennes, a game which they lost to a stoppage-time goal after playing for an
  hour with an extra man. “It was a fight like I’ve never seen in all my years
  in football. For the first time in my career, I didn’t know what to say or
  what to do,” said De Zerbi on Friday. “I’ve never seen anything like it. I
  come from the streets, I’m used to fights. But I’ve never seen anything like
  this. The club’s bodyguards were trying to separate them. Normally they’re
  supposed to protect us from others, not from ourselves.” Pablo Longoria, the
  club president, described the incident as “extremely violent”, but on Saturday
  De Zerbi said he hoped the relationship between Marseille and Rabiot could be
  “repaired”. AFP Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest have arrived at Selhurst Park
  with a somewhat bemused-looking police escort. The match is expected to be
  spicier than usual, given the clubs’ controversial European switcheroo. We’ve
  got a goal in Paisley and it’s gone to the hosts, Mandron’s pass slicing open
  the Rangers defence to set up Jonah Ayunga for the opener. So far, this
  performance is hitting all the wrong notes as far as Russell Martin is
  concerned. St Mirren have another good opportunity through Mikael Mandron, but
  he can only divert the ball wide at the back post. St Mirren carve out a
  couple of decent chances, Alex Gogic heading a free-kick delivery straight at
  Jack Butland before Killian Phillips skews wide from the edge of the box. At
  the other end, Jayden Meghoma tees up Lyall Cameron but he also makes a hash
  of the finish. It’s been a fiesty start to the match in Paisley, where St
  Mirren have already committed six fouls and are pressing Rangers aggressively.
  Oliver Antman has tested Shamal George, the St Mirren goalkeeper, with a
  long-range effort, but otherwise the visitors haven’t created much. More
  photos are streaming in from Hill Dickinson Stadium, where David Moyes and his
  players have been getting used to their new surroundings. Thanks Dom, enjoy
  your deserved hour away from bad screen (work computer) even if we all know
  you’re heading straight to good screen (The Big Match Revisited on ITV4).
  While Dom takes in the highlights of Arsenal’s 3-1 victory over Manchester
  United from November 1975, in the present, St Mirren v Rangers has kicked off,
  but it’s goalless as things stand. Right, with that I shall hand the matchday
  live blog reins over to Will Magee for an hour while I grab a sandwich and a
  blessed screen break. I enjoyed this email from Ken Andrew: Lovely words on
  Morecambe by Sam Dalling. 45 years ago as a cub reporter on the Morecambe
  Visitor I used to share the press box at the old ground with my opposition
  from the Lancaster Guardian Dick Quick. What a byline! Different times of
  course. One of the directors was a local butcher who used to come to home
  games in his bloodied apron carrying a huge tray of meat pies. And the club
  was tottering even then. Save Our Shrimps was one campaign we ran. Delighted
  the club has been saved. Come on you Shrimps! Manchester United fans are
  taking an interest in the Royal Antwerp v Mechelen team news today. And, as
  called by our own Jamie Jackson, there’s no Senne Lammens amid serious
  interest from United in the 23-year-old goalkeeper. A move worth around £17m
  is anticipated. The pictures from outside the Hill Dickinson Stadium are
  starting to drop. Looks like a corking day weather-wise on Merseyside for
  Everton fans to officially christen their new ground. The early Craven Cottage
  team news is that André Onana is in the Manchester United squad, so could come
  back into the side, with Bayindir having failed to impress when given an
  opportunity against Arsenal last week. It will be fascinating to see whether
  Ruben Amorim slots Sesko straight in, having used him as a substitute last
  week. Although shorn of a true No 9, United’s frontline of Matheus Cunha,
  Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount looked quite fluid and fluent against the Gunners
  and Sesko made little impact in his 25 minutes of game-time. Mount is the
  likeliest to drop to the bench to accommodate the ex RB Leipzig frontman. John
  Brewin is (presumably) enjoying a lovely summer’s walk by Putney Bridge ahead
  of Fulham v Manchester United later and has sent us this scene-setter: Bright
  sunshine by the Thames, where Manchester United travel to Fulham for the later
  Sunday game. Optimism of a decent performance against Arsenal last week is
  measured at United by the thought of losing the opening two matches. That
  happened three seasons ago and United finished third. Are hopes that high? Not
  especially. Who plays in goal? André Onana, Altay Bayindir or Tom Heaton? Will
  Benjamin Sesko start? Fulham fans meanwhile await a new signing. Last week at
  Brighton, they got better as the game went on, and Rodrigo Muniz, offered a
  new deal, made a big difference, the fans asking him to stay. He smashed
  Liverpool’s defence to smithereens back in April. United have a decent record
  at the Cottage but not a great record under their current manager. Like so
  many other clubs in this second round of matches, the pressure is fully on.
  We’ll bring you semi-regular updates from that game at The SMISA Stadium, by
  the way. Steam is already emerging from the ears of some Gers’ hardcore … This
  is hot off the press, ahead of the midday kickoff in Paisley. A really big
  game for Russell Martin where nothing less than a win will do – and he appears
  to have picked a team without a recognised No 9. St Mirren: George; Fraser,
  Gogic, Freckleton; Richardson, Phillips, Baccus, O’Hara, John. Ayunga,
  Mandron. Subs: Mullen, Sobawale, King, Tanser, Taylor, Idowu, Dijksteel,
  Calvin, Mooney. Rangers: Butland; Aarons, Souttar, Fernandes, Meghoma; Raskin,
  Rothwell, Cameron; Antman, Gassama, Aasgard. Subs: Kelly, Tavernier, Barron,
  Diomande, Dowell, Moore, Curtis, Igamane, Danilo. Can we talk about Sheffield
  United for a moment? The Blades, having racked up 90 points under Chris Wilder
  last season – narrowly missing out on a return to the Premier League – decided
  in their infinite wisdom that sacking Wilder was the smartest move. His
  replacement Ruben Selles is already feeling the pressure, recognising that
  after a 1-0 home defeat to Millwall yesterday the club are “in a tough
  situation”. He’s lost three from three so far. Blades fans, please get in
  touch. There’s some talk on social media about bringing Wilder back (again).
  Why isn’t it working for Selles and where do you go from here? (The words are
  coming out all weird …) An email has landed from Gary Naylor. Hi. Like most
  Everton fans going to Hill Dickinson, about 25% of the talk this morning is
  about the match, the event, the history. The other 75% is about where to park,
  how far the walk is and how the hell anyone with mobility issues can actually
  get to the ground. Gonna be great though. I’m keen to hear from more Everton
  fans this morning, or indeed any supporters who have experienced watching
  their team in a new stadium for the first time. My team still play in a
  crumbling, leaking wreck of a ground, so I can only dream. A couple of big
  reads on Everton’s new ground, and how teams tend to fare on their new stadium
  debuts. Ange Postecoglou is believed to be in the frame to replace Nuno if and
  when he departs Nottingham Forest. For now, the Portuguese has a game away at
  Crystal Palace to contend with. They’re in the Europa League. They came
  seventh last season. They won their opening game. Beguiling stuff. What Nuno
  said about his own Nottingham Forest future was really quite incredible. We
  know Forest’s owner Evangelos Marinakis can be a combustible character but you
  rarely hear a manager talk this way, with Nuno admitting there was “no smoke
  without fire” re reports he could get the sack. I always had a very good
  relationship with the owner, last season was very close, almost [talking on a]
  daily basis. This season, not so well, but I always believe that dialogue and
  your opinion is always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season
  that we have ahead of us. But our relations have changed. It is not so close
  [now]. I’m being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it’s
  not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know. My job is always to try to
  anticipate what’s coming ahead of us, and that’s what I said with respect. I
  think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality. The
  reality is that [it] is not what it used to be. It was a good, respectful
  relationship, but that was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now
  it’s not so good. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things
  work, but I’m here to do my job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the
  first one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned. There’s no smoke
  without fire. We’ve got a real treat for you London-based readers/listeners
  next month. Football Weekly live lands at the Troxy on 11 September with Max
  Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew.
  What’s not to like? Grab a ticket. That’s a timely story, as my next thought
  was to go through all the main transfer headlines as things stand: There
  appears to be a three-way race for Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, who is wanted
  by Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig and Aston Villa Two players also heading for the
  Chelsea exit door are Aaron Anselmino and Carney Chukwuemeka who are both
  going to Borussia Dorrmund, the former on loan and the latter on a permanent
  deal Savinho is wanted by Tottenham but Manchester City are holding out for a
  chunky fee for the winger Arsenal look set to sign 16-year-old Shamrock Rovers
  star Victor Ozhianvuna in what could be an Irish transfer record. Royal
  Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is set to miss his team’s match against
  Mechelen today due to his €20m (£17m) proposed transfer to Manchester United.
  This one is an exclusive from our man Jamie Jackson. David Moyes likened
  moving into the Hill Dickinson Stadium to a “new romance” for Everton and the
  aesthetics are certainly nice when it comes to the architecture and
  engineering. Will supporters fall head over heels in love like they did, over
  the decades, with Goodison Park? A long marriage has a lot to do with how the
  team is and what team we put on the pitch over the years to come. Can we make
  that marriage last with the supporters and everybody at the club? I think
  that’s the next bit. It would help, if the Toffees could produce an
  appropriately attractive display today against Brighton. (In truth, anything
  would be better than their lousy performance at Leeds on Monday). Let’s dip
  back into some Serie A chat. And once again yesterday for Napoli, it was all
  about Scott McTominay. The recently-crowned Amalfi Coast King (TM) headed the
  Italian champions in front at Sassuolo before some Belgian midfielder named
  Kevin de Bruyne curled home a free-kick on his Napoli debut to round off a 2-0
  victory. Meanwhile, Brazilian right-back Wesley also scored on his debut for
  Roma, that the only goal in their 1-0 win over Bologna – in which Brighton
  loanee Evan Ferguson was named Player of the Match. The Rome club’s veteran
  manager Gian Piero Gasperini was impressed with the Irish striker. He said:
  “Ferguson? He played a great game, and his condition is improving. He played
  very little last year, and needs to get used to it, but tonight he showed some
  important qualities for us. He has a lot of potential and will give us great
  satisfaction in the long run.” This is a nice piece from Sam Dalling on
  Morecambe, who won their (delayed) opening game of the season yesterday having
  been saved from extinction just days earlier. A huge win for the club, for new
  manager Ashvir Singh Johal and for football. What else is happening today away
  from the Premier League? Well at midday in Scotland it’s a huge fixture for
  Rangers and under-fire Russell Martin, who really needs three points at St
  Mirren. There’s already been speculation around his future after an
  inauspicious start at Ibrox for the former Southampton boss. There are a few
  games in La Liga, including for Real Madrid who take on Sid Lowe’s Real Oviedo
  this evening, while in Italy Juventus take on Parma and Cesc Fàbregas’ Como
  host Lazio. Speaking of Manchester United, here’s Jonathan Wilson on the fresh
  pressure facing Ruben Amorim. At 2pm today we’ve got the following: Crystal
  Palace v Nottingham Forest Everton v Brighton Then it’s Fulham v Manchester
  United at 4.30pm. And honestly, who can predict any of those games? Palace
  have lost Eze, but Forest – despite winning their opening game convincingly –
  appear to be in turmoil. I think the comment below sums the situation up
  nicely. A new deal for Nuno? Hmm, maybe. As for the other games, Everton
  should be bang up for their new stadium debut but Brighton are Brighton. I’ll
  get onto United a bit later … (All times are BST) While Arteta did express
  concern regarding those injuries to Saka and Ødegaard, he also welcomed the
  addition of Eberechi Eze, who was beaming from ear to ear after being paraded
  in front of the Arsenal fans. Eze completed a move from Crystal Palace worth
  £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons. On the new signing, Arteta said: “I think he has
  the capacity to create these magic moments. He’s got that flair, that charisma
  that is very contagious. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right
  or left. He doesn’t care. He plays shifted off the left, as well. I’m sure we
  will find the right place for him.” And what of 15-year-old academy sensation
  Max Dowman? Arteta was always going to be asked about him after Dowman made
  his league debut, becoming the Premier League’s second ever youngest player.
  “Max has zero hesitation,” Arteta said. “He’s so convinced that he can go at
  15 and deliver, which I’ve never witnessed in my life. For us, it brings joy,
  it brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.” Before we
  look ahead to today’s action, let’s drop in a bit of Arsenal reaction. They
  were at their destructive best against Leeds last night. Here’s Jacob
  Steinberg assessing the new Mikel Arteta era at the Emirates. Let’s start with
  a quick reminder of what happened yesterday: Pep Guardiola was forced to
  defend James Trafford after the goalkeeper’s error in Manchester City’s 2-0
  home defeat by Tottenham Arsenal’s 5-0 thrashing of Leeds was tainted by
  injuries to Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard, causing concern for Mikel Arteta
  Burnley saw off Sunderland 2-0 at Turf Moor to pick up their first victory
  since returning to the top flight Brentford beat a blunt Aston Villa 1-0 to
  give Keith Andrews his first win as Bees boss; Bournemouth sunk Wolves by the
  same score In La Liga, Barcelona battled back from 2-0 down to beat Levante
  but Marcus Rashford was hooked at half-time on his full Blaugrana debut In the
  Championship, Coventry announced they had bought their stadium – and
  celebrated in fine style by thrashing QPR 7-1; Abdul Fatawu’s stunner secured
  three points for Leicester at Charlton And in the Bundesliga, Harry Kane
  (three), Michael Olise (two) and Luis Díaz were on target as Bayern Munich
  hammered RB Leipzig 6-0. Morning all. Welcome to another of these matchday
  live blogs, the place where we pull together all our weekend football
  reaction, buildup and general chat around fixtures, and where you’re always
  encouraged to drop us an email and join the conversation. The idea is that
  we’re your one-stop-shop on matchday mornings and beyond – well… until the
  games kick off. And it feels like the Premier League season really got started
  yesterday. We had wins for hitherto written-off Burnley and Brentford, an
  actual 15-year-old starring for Arsenal and a surprise result at the Etihad
  (if you can call another Spurs win away at Manchester City a surprise –
  they’ve done it three times in the last three-and-a-half years). There’s
  plenty going on today, too. Everton make their league debut in their shiny new
  ground, the Hill Dickinson Stadium, Nottingham Forest travel to Selhust Park
  amid rumours surrounding Nuno Espírito Santo’s future as manager, and
  Manchester United will be playing football, which is always entertaining as
  long as you don’t support Manchester United. Let us know how you’re taking in
  today’s action and any wild predictions or theories you’d like to share at
  this nascent stage of the season. Let’s get into it!

No doubt he will be closely watched by the Sky Sports cameras today after his comments about his shaky relationship with Evangelos Marinakis, the club’s owner, in his pre-match press conference. Thelo Aasgaard and Djeidi Gassama have forced George, the St Mirren keeper, into action, but Rangers have failed to find a way through and it remains 1-0 to the hosts at the break. Martin has, understandably, cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines. Jonathan Rowe has signed for Bologna after being forced out of Marseille following a changing room fight with Adrien Rabiot which resulted in both players being put on the transfer list. Bologna offered no more details on the transfer but Italian media report that the Serie A club agreed a fee of €19.5m (£17m) for Rowe who has signed a four-year deal. Marseille announced Rowe’s departure in a brief post on their website, wishing him “good luck”. Rowe, 22, signed for Marseille on loan from Norwich last year and scored three times in 28 games in his first season in Ligue 1, before his move was made permanent in the summer. But the Under-21 England international was put up for sale on Tuesday, in the aftermath of an altercation with Rabiot which Roberto De Zerbi, the Marseille coach, called a “bar fight”. The brawl kicked off after a 1-0 defeat in Marseille’s opening fixture of the Ligue 1 season at Rennes, a game which they lost to a stoppage-time goal after playing for an hour with an extra man. “It was a fight like I’ve never seen in all my years in football. For the first time in my career, I didn’t know what to say or what to do,” said De Zerbi on Friday. “I’ve never seen anything like it. I come from the streets, I’m used to fights. But I’ve never seen anything like this. The club’s bodyguards were trying to separate them. Normally they’re supposed to protect us from others, not from ourselves.” Pablo Longoria, the club president, described the incident as “extremely violent”, but on Saturday De Zerbi said he hoped the relationship between Marseille and Rabiot could be “repaired”. AFP Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest have arrived at Selhurst Park with a somewhat bemused-looking police escort. The match is expected to be spicier than usual, given the clubs’ controversial European switcheroo. We’ve got a goal in Paisley and it’s gone to the hosts, Mandron’s pass slicing open the Rangers defence to set up Jonah Ayunga for the opener. So far, this performance is hitting all the wrong notes as far as Russell Martin is concerned. St Mirren have another good opportunity through Mikael Mandron, but he can only divert the ball wide at the back post. St Mirren carve out a couple of decent chances, Alex Gogic heading a free-kick delivery straight at Jack Butland before Killian Phillips skews wide from the edge of the box. At the other end, Jayden Meghoma tees up Lyall Cameron but he also makes a hash of the finish. It’s been a fiesty start to the match in Paisley, where St Mirren have already committed six fouls and are pressing Rangers aggressively. Oliver Antman has tested Shamal George, the St Mirren goalkeeper, with a long-range effort, but otherwise the visitors haven’t created much. More photos are streaming in from Hill Dickinson Stadium, where David Moyes and his players have been getting used to their new surroundings. Thanks Dom, enjoy your deserved hour away from bad screen (work computer) even if we all know you’re heading straight to good screen (The Big Match Revisited on ITV4). While Dom takes in the highlights of Arsenal’s 3-1 victory over Manchester United from November 1975, in the present, St Mirren v Rangers has kicked off, but it’s goalless as things stand. Right, with that I shall hand the matchday live blog reins over to Will Magee for an hour while I grab a sandwich and a blessed screen break. I enjoyed this email from Ken Andrew: Lovely words on Morecambe by Sam Dalling. 45 years ago as a cub reporter on the Morecambe Visitor I used to share the press box at the old ground with my opposition from the Lancaster Guardian Dick Quick. What a byline! Different times of course. One of the directors was a local butcher who used to come to home games in his bloodied apron carrying a huge tray of meat pies. And the club was tottering even then. Save Our Shrimps was one campaign we ran. Delighted the club has been saved. Come on you Shrimps! Manchester United fans are taking an interest in the Royal Antwerp v Mechelen team news today. And, as called by our own Jamie Jackson, there’s no Senne Lammens amid serious interest from United in the 23-year-old goalkeeper. A move worth around £17m is anticipated. The pictures from outside the Hill Dickinson Stadium are starting to drop. Looks like a corking day weather-wise on Merseyside for Everton fans to officially christen their new ground. The early Craven Cottage team news is that André Onana is in the Manchester United squad, so could come back into the side, with Bayindir having failed to impress when given an opportunity against Arsenal last week. It will be fascinating to see whether Ruben Amorim slots Sesko straight in, having used him as a substitute last week. Although shorn of a true No 9, United’s frontline of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount looked quite fluid and fluent against the Gunners and Sesko made little impact in his 25 minutes of game-time. Mount is the likeliest to drop to the bench to accommodate the ex RB Leipzig frontman. John Brewin is (presumably) enjoying a lovely summer’s walk by Putney Bridge ahead of Fulham v Manchester United later and has sent us this scene-setter: Bright sunshine by the Thames, where Manchester United travel to Fulham for the later Sunday game. Optimism of a decent performance against Arsenal last week is measured at United by the thought of losing the opening two matches. That happened three seasons ago and United finished third. Are hopes that high? Not especially. Who plays in goal? André Onana, Altay Bayindir or Tom Heaton? Will Benjamin Sesko start? Fulham fans meanwhile await a new signing. Last week at Brighton, they got better as the game went on, and Rodrigo Muniz, offered a new deal, made a big difference, the fans asking him to stay. He smashed Liverpool’s defence to smithereens back in April. United have a decent record at the Cottage but not a great record under their current manager. Like so many other clubs in this second round of matches, the pressure is fully on. We’ll bring you semi-regular updates from that game at The SMISA Stadium, by the way. Steam is already emerging from the ears of some Gers’ hardcore … This is hot off the press, ahead of the midday kickoff in Paisley. A really big game for Russell Martin where nothing less than a win will do – and he appears to have picked a team without a recognised No 9. St Mirren: George; Fraser, Gogic, Freckleton; Richardson, Phillips, Baccus, O’Hara, John. Ayunga, Mandron. Subs: Mullen, Sobawale, King, Tanser, Taylor, Idowu, Dijksteel, Calvin, Mooney. Rangers: Butland; Aarons, Souttar, Fernandes, Meghoma; Raskin, Rothwell, Cameron; Antman, Gassama, Aasgard. Subs: Kelly, Tavernier, Barron, Diomande, Dowell, Moore, Curtis, Igamane, Danilo. Can we talk about Sheffield United for a moment? The Blades, having racked up 90 points under Chris Wilder last season – narrowly missing out on a return to the Premier League – decided in their infinite wisdom that sacking Wilder was the smartest move. His replacement Ruben Selles is already feeling the pressure, recognising that after a 1-0 home defeat to Millwall yesterday the club are “in a tough situation”. He’s lost three from three so far. Blades fans, please get in touch. There’s some talk on social media about bringing Wilder back (again). Why isn’t it working for Selles and where do you go from here? (The words are coming out all weird …) An email has landed from Gary Naylor. Hi. Like most Everton fans going to Hill Dickinson, about 25% of the talk this morning is about the match, the event, the history. The other 75% is about where to park, how far the walk is and how the hell anyone with mobility issues can actually get to the ground. Gonna be great though. I’m keen to hear from more Everton fans this morning, or indeed any supporters who have experienced watching their team in a new stadium for the first time. My team still play in a crumbling, leaking wreck of a ground, so I can only dream. A couple of big reads on Everton’s new ground, and how teams tend to fare on their new stadium debuts. Ange Postecoglou is believed to be in the frame to replace Nuno if and when he departs Nottingham Forest. For now, the Portuguese has a game away at Crystal Palace to contend with. They’re in the Europa League. They came seventh last season. They won their opening game. Beguiling stuff. What Nuno said about his own Nottingham Forest future was really quite incredible. We know Forest’s owner Evangelos Marinakis can be a combustible character but you rarely hear a manager talk this way, with Nuno admitting there was “no smoke without fire” re reports he could get the sack. I always had a very good relationship with the owner, last season was very close, almost [talking on a] daily basis. This season, not so well, but I always believe that dialogue and your opinion is always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season that we have ahead of us. But our relations have changed. It is not so close [now]. I’m being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know. My job is always to try to anticipate what’s coming ahead of us, and that’s what I said with respect. I think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality. The reality is that [it] is not what it used to be. It was a good, respectful relationship, but that was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work, but I’m here to do my job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned. There’s no smoke without fire. We’ve got a real treat for you London-based readers/listeners next month. Football Weekly live lands at the Troxy on 11 September with Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew. What’s not to like? Grab a ticket. That’s a timely story, as my next thought was to go through all the main transfer headlines as things stand: There appears to be a three-way race for Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, who is wanted by Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig and Aston Villa Two players also heading for the Chelsea exit door are Aaron Anselmino and Carney Chukwuemeka who are both going to Borussia Dorrmund, the former on loan and the latter on a permanent deal Savinho is wanted by Tottenham but Manchester City are holding out for a chunky fee for the winger Arsenal look set to sign 16-year-old Shamrock Rovers star Victor Ozhianvuna in what could be an Irish transfer record. Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is set to miss his team’s match against Mechelen today due to his €20m (£17m) proposed transfer to Manchester United. This one is an exclusive from our man Jamie Jackson. David Moyes likened moving into the Hill Dickinson Stadium to a “new romance” for Everton and the aesthetics are certainly nice when it comes to the architecture and engineering. Will supporters fall head over heels in love like they did, over the decades, with Goodison Park? A long marriage has a lot to do with how the team is and what team we put on the pitch over the years to come. Can we make that marriage last with the supporters and everybody at the club? I think that’s the next bit. It would help, if the Toffees could produce an appropriately attractive display today against Brighton. (In truth, anything would be better than their lousy performance at Leeds on Monday). Let’s dip back into some Serie A chat. And once again yesterday for Napoli, it was all about Scott McTominay. The recently-crowned Amalfi Coast King (TM) headed the Italian champions in front at Sassuolo before some Belgian midfielder named Kevin de Bruyne curled home a free-kick on his Napoli debut to round off a 2-0 victory. Meanwhile, Brazilian right-back Wesley also scored on his debut for Roma, that the only goal in their 1-0 win over Bologna – in which Brighton loanee Evan Ferguson was named Player of the Match. The Rome club’s veteran manager Gian Piero Gasperini was impressed with the Irish striker. He said: “Ferguson? He played a great game, and his condition is improving. He played very little last year, and needs to get used to it, but tonight he showed some important qualities for us. He has a lot of potential and will give us great satisfaction in the long run.” This is a nice piece from Sam Dalling on Morecambe, who won their (delayed) opening game of the season yesterday having been saved from extinction just days earlier. A huge win for the club, for new manager Ashvir Singh Johal and for football. What else is happening today away from the Premier League? Well at midday in Scotland it’s a huge fixture for Rangers and under-fire Russell Martin, who really needs three points at St Mirren. There’s already been speculation around his future after an inauspicious start at Ibrox for the former Southampton boss. There are a few games in La Liga, including for Real Madrid who take on Sid Lowe’s Real Oviedo this evening, while in Italy Juventus take on Parma and Cesc Fàbregas’ Como host Lazio. Speaking of Manchester United, here’s Jonathan Wilson on the fresh pressure facing Ruben Amorim. At 2pm today we’ve got the following: Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest Everton v Brighton Then it’s Fulham v Manchester United at 4.30pm. And honestly, who can predict any of those games? Palace have lost Eze, but Forest – despite winning their opening game convincingly – appear to be in turmoil. I think the comment below sums the situation up nicely. A new deal for Nuno? Hmm, maybe. As for the other games, Everton should be bang up for their new stadium debut but Brighton are Brighton. I’ll get onto United a bit later … (All times are BST) While Arteta did express concern regarding those injuries to Saka and Ødegaard, he also welcomed the addition of Eberechi Eze, who was beaming from ear to ear after being paraded in front of the Arsenal fans. Eze completed a move from Crystal Palace worth £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons. On the new signing, Arteta said: “I think he has the capacity to create these magic moments. He’s got that flair, that charisma that is very contagious. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right or left. He doesn’t care. He plays shifted off the left, as well. I’m sure we will find the right place for him.” And what of 15-year-old academy sensation Max Dowman? Arteta was always going to be asked about him after Dowman made his league debut, becoming the Premier League’s second ever youngest player. “Max has zero hesitation,” Arteta said. “He’s so convinced that he can go at 15 and deliver, which I’ve never witnessed in my life. For us, it brings joy, it brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.” Before we look ahead to today’s action, let’s drop in a bit of Arsenal reaction. They were at their destructive best against Leeds last night. Here’s Jacob Steinberg assessing the new Mikel Arteta era at the Emirates. Let’s start with a quick reminder of what happened yesterday: Pep Guardiola was forced to defend James Trafford after the goalkeeper’s error in Manchester City’s 2-0 home defeat by Tottenham Arsenal’s 5-0 thrashing of Leeds was tainted by injuries to Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard, causing concern for Mikel Arteta Burnley saw off Sunderland 2-0 at Turf Moor to pick up their first victory since returning to the top flight Brentford beat a blunt Aston Villa 1-0 to give Keith Andrews his first win as Bees boss; Bournemouth sunk Wolves by the same score In La Liga, Barcelona battled back from 2-0 down to beat Levante but Marcus Rashford was hooked at half-time on his full Blaugrana debut In the Championship, Coventry announced they had bought their stadium – and celebrated in fine style by thrashing QPR 7-1; Abdul Fatawu’s stunner secured three points for Leicester at Charlton And in the Bundesliga, Harry Kane (three), Michael Olise (two) and Luis Díaz were on target as Bayern Munich hammered RB Leipzig 6-0. Morning all. Welcome to another of these matchday live blogs, the place where we pull together all our weekend football reaction, buildup and general chat around fixtures, and where you’re always encouraged to drop us an email and join the conversation. The idea is that we’re your one-stop-shop on matchday mornings and beyond – well… until the games kick off. And it feels like the Premier League season really got started yesterday. We had wins for hitherto written-off Burnley and Brentford, an actual 15-year-old starring for Arsenal and a surprise result at the Etihad (if you can call another Spurs win away at Manchester City a surprise – they’ve done it three times in the last three-and-a-half years). There’s plenty going on today, too. Everton make their league debut in their shiny new ground, the Hill Dickinson Stadium, Nottingham Forest travel to Selhust Park amid rumours surrounding Nuno Espírito Santo’s future as manager, and Manchester United will be playing football, which is always entertaining as long as you don’t support Manchester United. Let us know how you’re taking in today’s action and any wild predictions or theories you’d like to share at this nascent stage of the season. Let’s get into it!
