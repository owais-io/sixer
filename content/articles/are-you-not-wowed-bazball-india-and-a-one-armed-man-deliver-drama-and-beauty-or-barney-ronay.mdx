  Well, that was something new. Have you ever seen the one‑armed man running a
  bye to the keeper while 20,000 people leap and writhe and hold their heads and
  the one-armed man shouts in agony? Have you ever seen figures picked out in
  silhouette at the top of the stand, posed in perfect shapes of triumph, dread
  and fear because another gobbet of time has passed, another dot, because
  essentially nothing has happened? Have you ever seen the one‑armed man walk
  down and prod the middle of the wicket between balls, like this is just
  another cricket day, and had to swallow a snort of disbelief at the extreme
  cinematic weirdness of this snapshot in time? At times such as these, immersed
  in the super-heated bubble at the final day at the Oval, all of this stuff
  undeniably happening but also basically nothing, a story told only to itself,
  you do wonder how you’d explain it to someone from Denmark. Words such as
  nuance, post-colonial, will, protocol gabbled out while the person from
  Denmark nods politely. Wait. Geopolitics! Hunger! Umpire’s call! And all of
  this expressed through 25 days of the most stiffly choreographed sporting
  activity ever devised. This is a game that takes place in trousers. It’s a
  dance around a semi‑invisible dark red ball. Two hours after the final notes
  at the Oval all that was left on one of the upper staircases in the stand at
  the Vauxhall End was a single abandoned black leather slip‑on shoe with an
  empty carton of snus balanced on top of it, and you thought, yeah, that seems
  about right. At the end of which India did definitely win here by six runs. On
  a grey and smudged south London morning, the Oval felt like a mini-Glastonbury
  before play. All the notes were here, the hum, the crackle, the shouts, the
  Indian section in the stands rising to wave at Dinesh Karthik as he marched
  across this sallow old lime green oval like a presidential candidate. This is
  a very distinct stage for urban sporting theatre. Crawl past on a 36 bus and
  you get to peer in over that high wall into an empty secret garden, peopled
  for six months of the year by a man with a broom, but tended and cherished for
  moments such as this when it feels like nowhere else in the world could
  possibly exist; and where suddenly something comes up out of the soil, echoes
  of other days, stored up energy, ghosts at the edge of the action. The first
  of those, that first Ashes Test in 1881, was so tense it is said one spectator
  died of a heart attack, while another chewed through an umbrella handle as
  Fred “the Demon” Spofforth worked his way through England’s batsmen. What was
  the modern equivalent here? Breaking your refresh button? Spontaneously
  combusting your own vape? Cricket, which is always dying even while it throbs
  with vibrant life, is always doing this to us, and always questioning itself,
  wondering about the end times even while it’s out there writing Ulysses again.
  Here England needed 35 to win and India three and a half wickets to level the
  series. The players came out to a huge rolling wave of applause, India’s
  fielders breaking from their huddle to sprint in unison, impossibly heroic
  already, a group who have given us everything over the past two months. And
  this was a day for Mohammed “the Demon” Siraj, who really is the most lovable
  maniac in sport, and who bowled like a god here to win this game. Jamie
  Overton hooked the first ball for four and Surrey-cut the next one and you
  waited for the energy to shift. Prasidh Krishna just laughed and you loved him
  for it. Jamie Smith still looked stuck, frozen, drained and was duly
  euthanised from the crease. England tried to Baz this, to play shots, because
  how else? But the ball was talking too, and the ball will have its say.
  Overton lasted one delivery from Siraj, who was bowling to his own stirring
  one-man montage soundtrack by now. Simple pieces of Test cricket, a leave,
  were greeted with huge cheers and gasps like Puccini being roared on by a
  heavy metal stadium. Josh Tongue came and went like filler in a western who
  exists only to be gunned down in the final shootout. And so it came to pass,
  as Chris Woakes walked down the pavilion steps for his Lord Nelson moment.
  Kiss me, Gus. This should not be happening. A one-armed man, sling tucked
  weirdly inside his woollen jumper, is trying to play elite sport. Gus Atkinson
  slogged a swirling six over long-on, like a man throwing the last sticks of
  furniture on to the fire. There was wild impromptu chatter about the tactics,
  the game‑state of how to rotate the one-armed man, how to farm him, all of it
  just noise in the dark. Siraj was always going to close this out. Atkinson’s
  off-stump was flattened and the moment seemed to stretch out. There was a
  breath, a beat, before the chaos of victory kicked in, figures running
  everywhere, an unceasing well of drama, needle, blood, skill leading to the
  perfect symmetry of a 2-2 draw. And all the while underneath the static and
  the shouts something else seemed to settle, the sound of quiet applause. Never
  mind the score, or the arguments over moments, luck, injury, whatever. It is
  simply time for hats off here. Plaudits to India for a wonderful effort. And
  from a home point of view, for Ben Stokes and the Bazball project. For all the
  bullshit, the moments of head-scratch, the infuriating asides, these lunatics
  are producing something entirely new. “Are You Not Entertained?” doesn’t
  really do it justice. Are you not wrung out, frazzled, wowed? It has been the
  most glorious experiment, moments of beauty, fun and impossible drama set
  always to its own insistent set of rhythms. And who knows, we may not see this
  again. This may be the thing, right here. Who knows if Stokes will play
  another Test in England? The plan is to keep rolling on, but Australia tends
  to be a bookend and England’s captain has been playing at this level for 14
  years. Woakes may be done. Joe Root, surely not. Mark Wood, not sure. Jofra
  Archer, not sure. But what a show they have given us. What are they going to
  say about Bazball? Who’s going to tell them? What sense will this make when
  cricket has become the Ryder Cup or some colours on a screen with a shouting
  man from Love Island? Even the ceremonials at the end were part of the
  theatre, like the final act of a Shakespeare comedy when all returns to
  laughter, bonds are formed, hands shaken, misunderstandings corrected. Stokes
  was pale and terse, deep in the Oval indoor school, but he talked first about
  the spectacle and the brilliance of the series. England do like to chat about
  being the saviours of Tests. There is self-interest in this. It’s a very
  well‑paid job. But it is also love, devotion and faith. “As a massive advocate
  of this format … this has certainly been one of those series that can keep
  that narrative around Test cricket is dying … so … well,” Stokes shrugged,
  while also sniffing at the idea that Harry Brook had let his team down by
  scoring the wrong kind of 111. Stokes made a good point about the selflessness
  of the remaining England seamers, putting their bodies on the line to fill the
  breach left by Woakes. He talked about Siraj with genuine admiration, which
  will, you feel, mean a lot to the man himself. He said he would now be
  “knocking about” the Hundred, which is a bit like Odin announcing at the end
  of the Asgard‑Jotunheim War that he fancies a game of Bop-It now. And so we
  must talk about the past and future, both of which do still have to exist
  outside the moment. Bazball can be maddening, cult-like, just another clique.
  England have talked mind‑bending rubbish at times. There have been shoulders
  picks, good-around-the-group picks. Any divvying up of this result should
  dwell on the selection of two players who just haven’t had any cricket, most
  obviously Jacob Bethell, who was shunted into the light and produced a
  tortured innings, a man out there batting with a stale baguette. The Baz-era
  has been maddening to every person from every other country who has ever heard
  a self-assured Englishman explaining the world to them while simultaneously
  conveying that, yeah, you’re doing really well, but we do still own this. The
  super cool optics, the iconography of lounging exceptionalism. It has been
  very funny at times. But this thing has also produced utterly thrilling
  cricket, sport that is simply unlike the stuff that went before. It has been
  postmodernism at times, taking these structures and relics and trying to do
  something new. What is batting? What is a game for? What is a nightwatchman?
  Test cricket is always an interplay of rules, shapes, tradition and the
  slightly tortured individuals at its centre. This has been pure personality,
  those old rules and protocols bent into a framework for self‑expression. It
  also gave us this final day, because England kept playing the same way to the
  end rather than falling into respectable defeat, a strange blend of colour,
  will, drama, art, maths, salt, sweet, sour, bitter, umami; and a reminder that
  this sport will always leave you both stuffed to the gills and deliciously
  unsatisfied. At close of play it no longer felt like a chilly November
  morning. It felt like February. It isn’t overly dramatic to say this might yet
  be the high point of all this. We will now need to talk about team building
  and the future. England do look well set for the Ashes, if the bowling can
  settle down and bodies heal. For now it is probably best just to be glad we
  got to see it.
