  The Foreign Office has summoned the Russian ambassador after missile strikes
  on Kyiv killed at least 17 people and damaged the city’s British Council
  office. The ambassador, Andrey Kelin, was summoned at 1pm in London, in direct
  response to the severe damage inflicted on the building, government sources
  said. The incident marks the first time British government property has been
  caught up in a Russian attack. “Putin’s strikes last night killed civilians,
  destroyed homes and damaged buildings, including the British Council and EU
  Delegation in Kyiv,” the foreign secretary, David Lammy, posted on X. “We have
  summoned the Russian Ambassador. The killing and destruction must stop.” The
  prime minister, Keir Starmer, has condemned the attacks as “senseless” and
  accused Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”. While the British Council’s
  offices suffered significant damage, they are not believed to have been
  directly hit by Russian strikes, but struck by shrapnel. A guard who waws
  injured is “shaken but stable”, Scott McDonald, the British Council chief
  executive said on X. It posted a picture showing the building with its windows
  and entrance smashed open and surrounded by glass and debris. Meanwhile the
  European Union summoned Russia’s envoy in Brussels, in response to the deadly
  Russian missile strikes on Kyiv that also hit the EU’s office. The two offices
  are in the same block. The commission said no EU staff were hurt and condemend
  the attacks. Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief said on X: “The
  overnight attack on Kyiv shows a deliberate choice to escalate and mock the
  peace efforts.” “No diplomatic mission should ever be a target should ever be
  a target,” Kallas said in a separate post, after a video call with EU staff in
  Kyiv. Four children are among the 15 people confirmed dead so far, according
  to Kyiv’s administration, with the numbers expected to rise as rescue teams
  continue to search for people trapped under the rubble. The European
  Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, said she was outraged by the attack
  on Kyiv that had also hit the EU office. She said in a statement it “shows
  that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorise Ukraine, blindly killing
  civilians – men, women and children and even targeting the European Union.”
  Pictures released by the commission showed wrecked office interiors with
  collapsed ceiling panels and shattered glass doors and windows. EU officials
  said two missiles landed within 50 metres of the building within 20 seconds.
  In an expression of sharp diplomatic rebuke, Russia’s chargé d’affaires in
  Brussels was summoned to the commission. Russia’s defence ministry said it
  carried out a strike against military air bases and companies “within
  Ukraine’s military-industrial complex”, using long-range weapons. Starmer said
  on X: “My thoughts are with all those affected by the senseless Russian
  strikes on Kyiv which have damaged the British Council building. “Putin is
  killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace. This bloodshed
  must end.” The British Council’s offices are seen as a representation of
  Britain’s soft power in Ukraine. For the last 30 years the organisation has
  worked as a bridge between London and Kyiv, offering academic links, arts
  programmes and English courses. A spokesperson for the British Council said:
  “Following last night’s attack, our British Council office in Kyiv has been
  severely damaged and will remain closed to the public until further notice.
  “Thankfully, our colleagues are all safe and our work with our Ukrainian
  partners in education and culture will continue uninterrupted.” It comes as US
  president Donald Trump hoped to set a meeting between Vladimir Putin and
  Volodymyr Zelensky, after he met Putin in Alaska two weeks ago, and Zelensky
  days later in Washington. Downing Street said earlier this week that Putin was
  stalling progress and accused him of being “disrespectful” to the peace
  process in his war with Ukraine. Since the Trump’s meetings with the Russian
  and Ukrainian leaders, Russia has said there are no plans between Putin and
  Zelensky. Last week the foreign office minister Stephen Doughty unveiled
  sanctions against eight organisations and individuals to “keep the pressure
  on” Putin who he claimed was exploiting “dodgy crypto networks”. Russia in
  return sanctioned 21 individuals including the former MP Denis MacShane,
  several journalists and the goverenment’s independent reviewer of terrorism
  legislation Jonathan Hall. Von der Leyen has said the European Commission
  would msoon propose a further package of “hard-biting sanctions” against
  Russia, the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. She
  also said the commission was “advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets
  to contribute to Ukraine’s defence reconstruction”.
