  Andy Farrell would be interested in another stint as the British &amp; Irish
  Lions head coach after his side’s series victory over the Wallabies. Farrell
  said he had hugely enjoyed his squad’s successful campaign in Australia and
  hinted he would consider doing the job again in New Zealand in 2029. Despite
  the Lions’ 22-12 third Test defeat, which ended the squad’s ambitions of a 3-0
  series sweep, Farrell did not sound remotely like a man who has coached his
  final Lions Test. “Everyone knows what I think about this concept,” said
  Farrell, reflecting on the Lions’ first series victory since 2013. “I love
  everything that the Lions is about and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the last eight
  weeks. There’s always ups and there’s always downs but the inner circle is a
  special place to be.” Asked if that meant he would be keen to coach the Lions
  again, Farrell smiled and told reporters to “read into that what you want”. In
  the shorter term he will be returning to his role as Ireland’s head coach but
  made a point of paying a fulsome tribute to the staff and players involved in
  “an unbelievably special” series victory that “will stay with us forever”.
  Farrell did concede the series had ended on a “frustrating” note but made
  clear Australia had fully deserved their win. “We said all along we wanted to
  win every game but the best team won on the night today. I have just said to
  the lads that on reflection it might take one or two beers, but they will be
  unbelievably proud of what they achieved throughout this tour. “We all know
  how hard it is to be successful on a Lions tour against a good side like
  Australia. When we get a bit of time to ourselves we will be unbelievably
  proud of what we have achieved. Lions tours are tough. The coaching staff have
  been great and we created a special memory together. The legacy for us is in
  that changing room. The togetherness of the whole group has been an absolute
  delight.” The playing squad are already hatching plans to regather in
  Australia in 2037 and the player of the series, Tadhg Beirne, said all
  concerned had enjoyed their time in Australia. “It has been such an incredible
  journey, we have loved every single moment of it,” said Beirne. “We have said
  we will be having a reunion here in 12 years’ time. We are going to start a
  kitty and make sure we are all back here to celebrate this series win.
  Everyone got on from day one and everyone has loved every minute of it. Ask
  anyone.” Dan Sheehan, who took over as captain after Maro Itoje failed a head
  injury assessment, made clear, though, that the Lions would have some regrets
  about their performance in Sydney. “It’s gutting, to be honest,” he told Sky
  Sports. “The aim of the tour was a 3-0 victory but fair play to the Wallabies.
  It is disappointing, especially in front of the amount of people who have
  travelled here to support us. It’s just not what we wanted tonight and it
  leaves a sour taste.” Farrell, meanwhile, has brushed aside suggestions the
  Lions missed a trick after lightning storms in the local area forced the game
  to be delayed for 38 minutes in the second half. The Lions opted to warm up
  back on the field for five minutes fewer than their opponents and the
  Wallabies coach, Joe Schmidt, felt his side had responded better to the
  hiatus. “We had been warned there might be lightning so we had a little bit of
  a plan,” he said. Schmidt also praised the way his players bounced back from
  the disappointment of losing the first two Tests. “That first half in the
  first Test was as good as I’ve seen [the Lions play],” said Schmidt. “They’ll
  judged as winners because that’s what happened. I tip my hat to what was a
  highly successful tour. But I couldn’t be prouder of the way the players
  rebounded.”
