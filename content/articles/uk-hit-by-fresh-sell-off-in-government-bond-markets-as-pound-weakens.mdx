  Rachel Reeves was hit by a fresh sell-off in government bond markets on
  Tuesday, underlining the formidable challenge facing the chancellor in the
  run-up to the autumn budget. The yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK
  government debt hit its highest level since 1998, at 5.723%, indicating that
  it will cost the UK more to borrow from the markets. Yields, which rise when a
  bond’s price falls, are a measure of the interest rate that investors demand
  when lending to a government or company. The rising yield on long-dated gilts,
  as UK government bonds are known, echoed a global shift that has pushed up
  borrowing costs in other major economies, amid fears about erratic US
  policies. “These moves are not anything UK-specific,” said Carsten Jung, the
  associate director for economic policy at the IPPR thinktank. Treasury
  officials pointed to similar increases in yields on Tuesday in Germany, the US
  and France. But with the government already spending more than £100bn a year
  in interest on the UK’s debts, the latest jump highlighted the extent to which
  the government feels constrained by the bond markets. The 10-year gilt yield,
  which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) uses to forecast
  future government borrowing costs, also rose on Tuesday, hitting its highest
  level since January. Meanwhile the pound weakened, falling by more than 1.5
  cents against the US dollar to $1.3390, its worst day since early April, when
  Donald Trump launched his global trade war. These latest market jitters
  followed a shakeup of key figures inside No10, that was widely read at
  Westminster as an attempt by Keir Starmer to get a firmer grip on economic
  policy. This included poaching Reeves’s deputy, Darren Jones, to a new role as
  Starmer’s “chief secretary” and appointing a heavyweight new economic adviser,
  former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik. Concern that the
  chancellor is being “managed out” is weighing on UK government bonds,
  suggested Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB. “The last time there
  was a threat to Reeves’s position, back in early July, bond yields jumped as
  the market worried that she could be replaced by a more left-leaning member of
  the Labour party,” Brooks said. The chancellor was filmed in tears in the
  House of Commons chamber in July, briefly prompting bond yields to rise as
  investors speculated she could be replaced with a more spendthrift
  alternative. Brooks confirmed that the UK was “not an outlier” in bond markets
  for the moment, but added: “As we lead up to the budget, the chancellor’s
  options are narrowing, and we could see more frequent bursts of bond market
  volatility. While we are not quite at Liz Truss levels of stress in the UK
  bond market, the ‘Starmer moment’ for markets could be coming down the line.”
  Reeves has argued that her fiscal rules, which some Labour MPs feel
  unnecessarily limit the government’s scope for action, reflect real-world
  limits on investors’ appetite for the UK’s debt. The rules, which apply in
  five years’ time, require her to balance day-to-day spending with tax receipts
  and reduce debt as a share of GDP. In a budget now not expected until
  mid-November at the earliest, the chancellor is widely expected to be forced
  to raise extra revenue with a fresh round of tax increases, to rebuild the
  “headroom” against these rules. City consultancy Capital Economics has
  predicted that weaker OBR forecasts may mean she has to raise £18-28bn, to
  leave herself with a buffer of £9.9bn. A recent flurry of reports about
  potential budget tax rises have worried bond investors, according to Marcus
  Jennings, a fixed-income strategist at Schroders. “Broadly speaking, whilst no
  specific policy has caused a sell-off in government bonds in isolation, the
  rush of potential policies is a reminder of how challenged the UK’s fiscal
  position is. This has likely facilitated a move higher in yields in the UK,
  notwithstanding the global move in long-end yields,” Jennings said. The
  Treasury is keen to damp down some of this speculation. Bank shares fell
  sharply last Friday after suggestions of a tax on the highly profitable
  sector. Ministers are also believed to be examining options for taxing
  property more heavily. Officials insist that tax changes will be focused on
  boosting economic efficiency, while Reeves’s central focus will remain
  improving the UK’s lacklustre productivity. It is a downgrade of the OBR’s
  forecasts for future productivity – the amount UK workers can produce in an
  hour, and a key determinant of economic growth – that is expected to weigh on
  its budget projections. The institution’s expectations for productivity are
  more optimistic than those of many other forecasters, and have repeatedly been
  disappointed in the recent past. Any shortfall against Reeves’s fiscal rule
  appears unlikely to be closed through significant spending cuts, after a
  backbench rebellion forced Downing Street to abandon plans for £5bn of
  disability cuts earlier this year. While bond prices fell on Tuesday, traders
  piled in to precious metals in a flight to safety. This pushed the gold price
  up to a new record high of $3,508 (£2,607) an ounce on Tuesday, while silver
  rose over $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011. Anxiety over fiscal
  sustainability is another factor hitting the bond market, with Donald Trump’s
  recent tax cuts and spending bill expected to add trillions of dollars to the
  US national debt. Trump’s recent attacks on the independence of the central
  bank, the Federal Reserve, have also rattled investors.
