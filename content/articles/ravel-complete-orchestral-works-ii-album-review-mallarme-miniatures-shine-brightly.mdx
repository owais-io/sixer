  Ravel: Complete Orchestral Works II album review – Mallarmé miniatures shine
  brightly
sectionName: Music
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-14T13:00:36Z'
bodyText: >-
  The first disc of Ludovic Morlot’s Ravel survey with the Barcelona orchestra
  of which he’s been music director since 2022 appeared last year. That included
  two of Ravel’s best known scores: the suite Le Tombeau de Couperin and the
  ballet Mother Goose. At the heart of this latest instalment are Ravel’s three
  orchestral song cycles: the mezzo soprano Fleur Barron sings Shéhérazade, the
  1904 settings of poems by Tristan Klingsor, and the 1913 Trois Poèmes de
  Stéphane Mallarmé, while between them the baritone Alexandre Duhamel is the
  soloist in the charming product of Ravel’s old age, which was originally
  intended as a film score, Don Quichotte à Dulcinée, from 1933. For all the
  oriental beauty of Shéhérazade, delivered with suitably seductive warmth by
  Barron, it is the Mallarmé miniatures that shine most brightly here, with
  Morlot carefully teasing out the instrumental strands of the accompanying
  ensemble, beautifully played by the Barcelona soloists, to create a shimmering
  web around Barron’s lucid shaping of the vocal lines. Duhamel is equally
  meticulous in his presentation of the Quichotte numbers, though he, and
  perhaps Morlot, too, sometimes seems a little restrained when a bit more
  earthiness would be appropriate. The three sets of songs are framed by purely
  orchestral pieces, opening with the fanfare that Ravel composed for the
  collective ballet for children L’Éventail de Jeanne, to which Roussel, Poulenc
  and Milhaud were also among the contributors, and ending with Ravel’s own
  orchestrations of his Valses Nobles et Sentimentales, given a slightly louche
  but thoroughly appropriate edge by Morlot. Stream it on Apple Music (above) or
