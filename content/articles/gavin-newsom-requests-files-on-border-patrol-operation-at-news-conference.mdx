  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has filed a request for information from
  the Trump administration over border patrol agents’ appearance at a news
  conference he hosted on Thursday. In a statement, Newsom said the presence of
  federal agents at his press briefing in Los Angeles was “intended to
  intimidate those defending a fair electoral process”. Dozens of armed and
  masked agents descended on the Japanese American National Museum’s National
  Center for the Preservation of Democracy, where Newsom was announcing a
  redistricting plan for California, in a raid widely condemned by the
  governor’s fellow Democrats. “Trump’s use of the military and federal law
  enforcement to try to intimidate his political opponents is yet another
  dangerous step towards authoritarianism,” Newsom wrote on social media. “This
  is an attempt to advance a playbook from the despots he admires in Russia and
  North Korea. “The Trump administration needs to answer for this pathetic and
  cowardly behavior.” The Los Angeles Times reported that Newsom had submitted a
  freedom of information request with the US Department of Homeland Security
  (DHS), asking for “all documents and records” related to the operation. The
  request seeks “any records referencing Governor Newsom or the rally that was
  scheduled to occur”, the Times reported, as well as any communications between
  federal law enforcement officials and Fox News, which embedded a reporter with
  the border patrol. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, condemned the raid on
  Thursday, stating it was not “a coincidence” the action took place steps from
  where Newsom was speaking. “The White House just sent federal agents to try to
  intimidate elected officials at a press conference,” she said in a social
  media post. “The problem for them is Los Angeles doesn’t get scared and Los
  Angeles doesn’t back down. We never have and we never will.” The DHS said Bass
  “must be misinformed”. “Our law enforcement operations are about enforcing the
  law – not about Gavin Newsom,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary,
  wrote in a post on social media. McLaughlin added that border patrol agents
  work in “all areas of Los Angeles every day with over 40 teams on the ground
  to make LA safe”. Newsom was unveiling a plan, known as the election rigging
  response act, that would override California’s independent redistricting
  commission and draw new congressional lines – a direct counter to a Texas
  effort, sought by Donald Trump, to push through electoral maps that could hand
  the president’s Republican party five extra US House seats in time for the
  2026 midterm election. The governor vowed the move would “neuter and
  neutralize” Texas’s proposal.
