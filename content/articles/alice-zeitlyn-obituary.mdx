  My mother, Alice Zeitlyn, who has died aged 100, was a charity volunteer for a
  huge range of causes in Cambridge, and the founder of the BB Zeitlyn Trust and
  Psychotherapy Training Fund, which continues to support trainee
  psychotherapists. Depicted in an embroidered panel displayed in Cambridge
  Library celebrating “Cambridge Women 1918-2018”, Alice was made MBE in 2009 in
  recognition of her many volunteering activities. Born in London to Josie (nee
  Davis), who had been a volunteer nurse during the first world war, and Frank
  Myers, who ran a building company, Alice went to South Hampstead high school
  in north London. After nursing training at University College hospital
  (1943-45), she worked at UCH, and also for a year in Quebec, in 1946. In 1949
  she married her childhood sweetheart, Bernard Zeitlyn, a psychiatrist and
  psychotherapist. They had a daughter, Judith, and two sons, Jonathan and me.
  In 1957 the family moved to Cambridge for Bernard’s work, and Alice spent the
  next 20 years running the family home. After Bernard died in a cycling
  accident in 1979, Alice created the BB Zeitlyn Trust and Psychotherapy
  Training Fund. She also became a stalwart volunteer for and supporter of an
  enormous range of charities and arts institutions, including the Museum of
  Cambridge (formerly the Folk Museum), Kettle’s Yard, and Scope. Having
  completed her first degree as an adult, in English and history at
  Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (CCAT, now Anglia Ruskin
  University), in 1982, Alice continued her studies in how the experiences of
  mature students differed from those of 18-year-old undergraduates, gaining an
  MPhil in 1988. Following this research she helped to set up a creche at CCAT,
  which later awarded her an honorary fellowship (1993). One of Alice’s fellow
  students was blind and had problems getting the braille texts he needed for
  the course so, in order to help him, Alice learned to read and write braille.
  This was long before automatic braille conversion or speaking computers. She
  continued to transcribe texts for the RNIB into the 1990s. Later, she taught
  braille to adults through Camsight, and also worked with Camtad (Campaign for
  Tackling Acquired Deafness). Her volunteering included changing hearing aid
  batteries: hard for people with visual disabilities, but easy for Alice whose
  fingers were kept nimble by her lifelong love of knitting. She was involved
  with several knitting groups and was until recently a member of the “Knits of
  the Round Table”, who support the Arthur Rank hospice. Both reading and music
  were important in her life. She played the cello and piano, and delivered
  library books to those unable to visit a library. She, in turn, greatly
  appreciated this service during her final years. Jonathan died in 1995. Alice
  is survived by Judith and me, two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
