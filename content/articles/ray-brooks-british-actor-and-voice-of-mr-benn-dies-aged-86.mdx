  Ray Brooks, the British actor who starred in EastEnders, Ken Loach’s drama
  Cathy Come Home and narrated the 1970s children’s TV show Mr Benn, has died at
  the age of 86. Brooks died peacefully on Saturday with his loved ones at his
  bedside after a short illness, according to a statement shared by his family
  with the BBC. The statement also revealed that Brooks had spent the last few
  years living with dementia. Brooks’ sons, Will and Tom, said: “His three true
  loves were family (he also had a daughter Emma, who died in 2003), Fulham
  Football Club, and spending time in Brighton, where he was born.” The cartoon
  Mr Benn, narrated by Brooks, follows the character who enters a magical
  costume shop and travels to new places based on the costumes he wears. Only 13
  episodes were released but the cartoon became well known with generations of
  children because episodes were repeated twice a year for more than 21 years.
  “I was asked to do other cartoons because of Mr Benn – including Rupert the
  Bear, which was the worst thing I’ve ever done. I used to have a couple of
  pints before recording it, to numb my brain for his terrible rhymes,” Brooks
  told the Guardian in 2017, adding: “Grandmas come up to me and say their
  grandchildren are fed up with today’s cartoons, but they love the simplicity
  of Mr Benn, the fact that he’s very moral, always sorting out people’s
  problems – including dragons.” Brooks went on to appear in a host of different
  primetime television shows including ITV’s Coronation Street, in which he
  played Norman Phillips, and EastEnders, where he played Joe Macer, who
  memorably killed his wife, the long-running character Pauline Fowler. Brooks
  also starred in the BBC comedy drama Big Deal, which followed gambler Robbie
  Box as he tried to make a living by betting while also trying to maintain his
  relationship with Jan, played by Sharon Duce. Brooks earned a number of film
  credits, including a role in The Knack … And How To Get It, which won the 1965
  Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival. A year later he starred in Ken Loach’s
  Cathy Come Home, a BBC drama filmed like a documentary, which explored the
  impact of Britain’s housing shortage in the late 1960s. In 2000, a British
  Film Institute poll of 100 industry figures rated it as the second-best
  British television programme ever made, after Fawlty Towers. Press Association
  contributed to this report.
