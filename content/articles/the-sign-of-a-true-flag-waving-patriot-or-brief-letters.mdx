  St George’s flags should only be allowed to be attached to lamp-posts if they
  are accompanied by a “certificate of conformity”, stating that they have been
  manufactured entirely in the UK or that they have been hand-knitted within a
  2.5 mile radius. I can’t imagine any patriot flying a flag not made in the UK
  (‘Don’t call this racist’: row grows over motives behind England flag
  campaign, 20 August). Bob Cooper Barlestone, Leicestershire • Unlike
  researchers in Illinois, I am not in the least “shocked” that birds stay awake
  longer due to light pollution (Report, 21 August). In 1976, I remember
  visiting Middlesbrough, home of Teesside Steelworks and a chemical plant, and
  seeing their huge sites bathed in light all night long. The hum of industry
  was accompanied by a remarkable level of birdsong at midnight. Spring birdsong
  at night was common in industrial cities in the north of England. Dr Simon
  Sweeney University of York • Anne Cowper may be disappointed about Keith
  Flett’s age (Letters, 21 August), but I shall never get over him giving custom
  to, of all places, Wetherspoon’s. How could you, Keith? Brian Smith Berlin,
  Germany • I use old spectacle cases (Letters, 22 August) as mini man-holders
  for loose coppers, old keys, nuts and bolts or anything else essential that I
  may never need again. Yair Klein London • Never mind early autumn fruit
  (Report, 19 August), in East Sussex we’ve got the first conkers. Dave Young St
  Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
  publication in our letters section.
