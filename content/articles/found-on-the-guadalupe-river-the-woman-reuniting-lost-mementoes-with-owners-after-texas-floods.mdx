  A child’s lifejacket, a small pink and blue swimming suit top, a delicate
  pearl and gold chain necklace – these are just some of the items that Dondi
  Persyn recovered from the Guadalupe River after the devastating floods that
  recently swept through central Texas. The flash floods that started over the
  Fourth of July weekend in Texas have killed at least 135 people – including
  many children – with authorities still searching for those who are missing.
  Most of the deaths were reported to have happened along the Guadalupe River in
  Kerr county. What started as a one-time act of kindness has now blossomed into
  a collective effort for Persyn, the 54-year-old grandmother from Boerne.
  Through her Facebook page, “Found on the Guadalupe River”, she has gathered,
  restored and returned thousands of items to those affected by the floods, each
  object a poignant reminder of loss, narrating a tragic tale. Her posts get up
  to 500,000 views daily. “I had this feeling that if it were my family, or my
  children or my grandchildren, I’d probably want something,” Persyn told the
  Guardian. “Most of us here are guarded, reverent. There is a quiet softness,
  and we’re holding our whole community that way.” The tragedy has played out in
  many ways. It has become a political football. David Richardson, the acting
  director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), defended his
  agency’s handling of the floods on Wednesday. After facing accusations that
  the response to the floods was botched, he called the response a “model” for
  how “disasters should be handled”. Trump floated the idea of eliminating Fema
  altogether during his first week in office, a notion repeated by the homeland
  security secretary, Kristi Noem, in March. But in affected communities it has
  also played out far more personally as they have reckoned with the terrible
  loss of life and emotional trauma. For Persyn, who rallied quickly in the wake
  of the disaster, her mobilization was “way faster than any of the officials”.
  Living up in the hills, she had been safe from the floods, but went out the
  next day to help search for people. She was there for 30 minutes before a body
  was found. Instead, while search operations continued, Persyn started picking
  up trash bags and collecting the items that had been strung across the river.
  “By the end of the day, I was the last collecting personal things, and the
  next day, I started a Facebook page,” she said. “Everything happened really
  quickly, I started putting pictures up and immediately people said ‘that’s
  mine’.” The first reunion was with a teacher who lived about a mile up from
  where her jewellery was found. She had lost everything in the floods, and
  Persyn spent hours the night before they met untangling her necklace in
  preparation, knowing it would mean something. Another lady was reunited with
  her totem pole, which had made its way down the river with its feathers
  intact. Persyn even tracked an Invisalign tooth brace back to the person who
  lost it. It’s not just objects, though; animals have been reunited with their
  owners. Samson the cat was found alive after two weeks, and it turned out that
  someone had been feeding him and ensuring he survived. “I credit that to the
  internet sleuths,” Persyn laughed. “It’s really fated. I was supposed to be
  here at this time, and we have to teach other communities to do what we did.”
  While there is a sense of hope in the day-to-day findings, which have now
  expanded from a one-woman business into a warehouse-oriented operation, Persyn
  detailed the difficulties she and her team have faced when items come in that
  likely belonged to young girls who were at the Camp Mystic summer camp and
  whose fate created headlines around the world. The camp, which offered two
  four-week terms and one two-week term over the summer, was the go-to summer
  camp for daughters of Texans for nearly a century. At least 27 campers and
  counselors were killed. “Every time we would get something that would come in
  with a little name on it, we have a special way we treat it; it’s all done
  really privately, not in the public,” Persyn said. “Early on, we developed a
  way to get them back to the parents. None of us know how to handle disaster,
  the rawness of losing a child and returning something that ended up at the
  bottom of a river.” A small lavender backpack, pink metallic cowboy boots and
  a Minnie Mouse toy were just some of the sentimental items parents on the
  Facebook group were asking the community of searchers to see if they could
  find. “At its core, this movement embodies reverence and respect for the
  tangible keepsakes that have been recovered. These precious mementoes are then
  returned to those who treasure every fragment of what has been found and the
  cherished memories they hold,” said Dondi’s close friend DeAnna Lindsay, who
  has been working with her daily since she started out. “Dondi has ignited a
  movement that will inspire others to replicate its kindness in their own
  communities during times of need.”
