  Good morning. Anger at the use of hotels to house asylum seekers has been
  bubbling all summer, sparking protests across the country, some of which have
  turned violent. Far-right agitators have been licking their lips at the
  prospect of another wave of anti-immigrant riots to force a change in asylum
  policy. But the move away from hotels may be hastened by something far more
  mundane yet powerful: planning law. This week, Epping Forest district council
  became the first local authority to win an interim injunction blocking asylum
  seekers from being placed in a local hotel, leaving Home Office officials
  reeling and prompting questions about further legal challenges. The ruling has
  been seized on by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who said the party’s 12
  councils would consider similar challenges. He also urged protests outside
  hotels across the country, hoping to replicate the “template” set by Epping
  Forest. If a string of councils succeed in closing down hotels, the Home
  Office might have to find alternative housing for thousands of people at short
  notice – forcing the politically explosive question of where that should be.
  So how did we get here, and can the government get itself out of this mess? To
  answer those questions, I spoke with Rajeev Syal, the Guardian’s home affairs
  editor. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Gaza | Israel has
  announced it is expanding its military operations in Gaza City, as the UK
  foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned its approval of a huge new illegal
  settlement in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law.” UK
  news | Labour is preparing to kick off a new wave of public-private
  partnerships (PPPs) in England to build the neighbourhood health centres at
  the heart of its NHS 10-year plan. Ukraine | Moscow has said it must be part
  of any international talks on Ukraine’s security, as Russia continues to stall
  on Donald Trump’s push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy. Technology | Scotland Yard’s plan to widen the use of live facial
  recognition technology is unlawful because it is incompatible with European
  laws, the equalities regulator has claimed. Housing | England will sell off
  more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were constructed the
  previous year, research has found. In depth: A shock judgment When Rajeev
  spoke to a Home Office official on Monday about the case lodged by Epping
  Forest, “they were quite relaxed”, he tells me. “That changed the next day
  when the verdict came out.” He explains that the challenge centred around the
  argument that the owners changed the purpose of their hotel without informing
  the local council. The hotel had first changed into an asylum hotel, which was
  used to house asylum seeking families; then it changed again to an asylum
  hotel housing young men. The council argued this occurred without planning
  permission. Rajeev says the Home Office is right to be worried as the ruling
  has significant implications. “The 140 people staying in this hotel, unless
  there’s a successful challenge, have to be moved out on 12 September at 4pm.
  “It shows that if a council challenges the use of the hotel in similar
  fashion, it could take just a month from the start of the challenge to getting
  people out. And if lots of councils managed to do that, it could land the Home
  Office with the job of rehousing thousands of people at short notice.” But how
  did we end up here in the first place, with hotels as the main form of housing
  for so many asylum seekers? *** How did we get into this mess? In 2020, the
  number of asylum seekers housed in hotels was about 1,200. By 2023, more than
  55,000 people seeking asylum (pdf) were living in them. The number has since
  fallen from that peak to about 30,000. The uptick stems from a ban on asylum
  seekers working, which was implemented in 2003, following criticism from the
  rightwing press that migrants were taking jobs from British people. Perhaps
  counterintuitively, this resulted in the government becoming legally obligated
  to provide accommodation for asylum seekers who, without the right to work,
  would otherwise end up on the streets. This is not exclusive to migrants.
  Councils must support Britons and other residents who are destitute and come
  forward as homeless. Asylum seekers who are housed and fed by the government
  receive £10 a week in spending money. The use of hotels specifically is
  another problem passed over from the previous government. As journalist Daniel
  Trilling explains in this informative piece, accommodation was once largely
  provided by local councils’ housing departments, but this was privatised
  during the Cameron-Clegg coalition government’s austerity drive. Privately run
  asylum accommodation then became the subject of growing scandals, with
  allegations that much of it was unfit for human habitation. Slowly, the
  government became increasingly reliant on hotels and other forms of short-term
  housing. This shift coincided with the Conservative government’s failed
  attempt to rewrite asylum law. Ministers sought to make it illegal to apply
  for asylum after arriving through irregular routes, such as crossing the
  Channel in small boats, by stipulating that applicants would be deported to
  Rwanda. Conservatives now claim that this crisis is unfolding because Labour
  removed the Rwanda policy, which was meant to act as a deterrent. Rajeev
  disagrees. “There was no proof that Rwanda proved to be a deterrent. The
  numbers of people coming over increased over those three years, before Rishi
  Sunak left office,” he says. “Over that period, the numbers of people in
  hotels went up.” *** What are the options? The options facing the Home Office
  now – if hotels are suddenly forced to stop housing asylum seekers – are
  politically toxic. “They come down to putting people in flats or houses, in
  what’s known as multiple occupancy housing (HMOs), or in large-scale sites
  such as barracks,” Rajeev says. But using that kind of accommodation for
  asylum seekers has also sparked protests. This month, plans to house 35
  families in flats above local shops in Waterlooville, in Hampshire, have been
  scrapped after more than 1,000 residents gathered for an anti-immigrant
  protest, calling on the government to “stop the boats”. Critics also argue the
  policy risks adding further strain to the rental market, where competition for
  housing is already intense and rents have risen sharply. “Barracks come with
  political implications too. When Labour were in opposition, they were critical
  of barracks,” Rajeev says. The Bibby Stockholm, a converted barge in Portland,
  Dorset, was decommissioned in November 2024 by the Labour government after
  safety concerns and protests. That said, Rajeev adds, this hasn’t stopped the
  government quietly expanding the use of Wethersfield, an airbase in Essex, as
  a place to house asylum seekers. The government could still win on appeal
  against Epping’s decision, arguing that the issue is national in scope and
  that its wider implications must be taken into account, Rajeev explains. “If
  they win, they can breathe a sigh of relief. But even if they do, this weekend
  will see demonstrations.” So even if this specific decision is overturned, the
  political damage is already done. *** Why is Labour on the back foot? Labour
  came into office promising to “take back control” of the asylum system, a
  message aimed at reassuring voters worried about immigration and at blunting
  attacks from the right. By the government’s own measures, it can point to
  results. The number of hotels used to house asylum seekers has halved in the
  year since Labour took power. The backlog of asylum applications has also
  fallen from its record highs, with ministers boasting that the rate of
  processing is up by 116% and that the UK has removed more people with no right
  to remain than at any point in the past five years. The government has also
  signed returns agreements with Iraq, Albania and Vietnam, and launched a pilot
  “one in, one out” scheme with France. “It’s tough on Home Office ministers who
  have made some progress over the last year, but then, like previous Home
  Office ministers, they just get terribly battered by events,” Rajeev says. “It
  remains a mess and a huge headache for Yvette Cooper, who has been the chair
  of the home affairs select committee and shadow home secretary. She knows this
  job inside out. Angela Eagle is also a very experienced minister who
  understands how this works. “Diana Johnson, who’s the policing minister, also
  has a strong track record, as does Jess Phillips. They’re all people who have
  a great record of actually getting things done and doing it well.” But by
  defining success so heavily in terms of enforcement and deterrence, Labour has
  aligned firmly with the right on immigration; leaving the party exposed if
  numbers rise again or critics demand tougher measures. “They’ve really failed
  to launch any kind of narrative as to why refugees and asylum seekers bring
  something good to Britain,” says Rajeev. Because of that, the debate remains
  in Reform’s preferred territory: a fight about who can be toughest on
  immigration, rather than a contest on Labour’s own terms. What else we’ve been

  fascinating opinion piece on what it means to be British. He argues that it’s
  healthy that people have such a hodgepodge of perceptions of the same thing.
