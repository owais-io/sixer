  At 82, Christine Thynne is an emerging artist. “Risk! There’s a colossal
  amount of risk,” Thynne says. She is about to perform her show, These
  Mechanisms, over three weeks at the Edinburgh fringe. While “emerging” isn’t a
  word often applied to artists in their 80s, Thynne says the description is
  appropriate. “I wasn’t there before,” she says. “I wasn’t a solo performer.”
  Thynne’s show melds aspects of her life – she trained as a physiotherapist in
  the 1960s – along with other passions. Among her props are planks, stepladders
  and water. “Things I shouldn’t be doing,” she says. “Moving scaffolding
  planks. Changing the shape of stepladders. Carrying water.” She enjoys sea
  kayaking, having progressed from being coached to paddling the Lofoten islands
  in Norway, in her 50s. “Sliding up a wave, going down the other side – it was
  so exciting,” she says. But when she was browsing the Grassmarket area of
  Edinburgh, Scotland, where she lives, and saw a brochure for a class in Dance
  Base, Scotland’s national centre for dance, she balked. The class was free for
  the over-60s, and Thynne was 68. “I thought: ‘Dare I?’” For many people,
  kayaking in open water would be scarier than joining a dance class, but “in
  life”, Thynne says, “there are occasions when you can lose your
  self-confidence. You can lose your identity. I was very nervous, wondering
  could I do it, would I be good enough?” She had done a bit of ballet and tap
  growing up in the north-east of England, and loved sport. Not to compete, but
  because she “loved the way the body moved”. At 16, she wrote to the chartered
  society of physiotherapists, and did a course on day release while working
  locally at Imperial Chemical Industries. “I still love the way the body
  moves,” she says, “How you can feel the tension in a muscle – is it the right
  place you’re feeling? Which muscles are weak? Which joints are affected? And
  how even with simple exercise, you can make people feel much better.” After a
  divorce in the mid-1980s, she embarked on a second career, teaching movement
  and music, and anatomy and massage to therapists, while raising two teenage
  sons. She has loved the outdoors since her mum, who was a professional
  musician, took Thynne and her two sisters “out into the fresh air, to have
  this love of the countryside, to go brambling, to walk. She gave that to us.”
  Thynne, similarly, is “somebody who pushes myself, takes opportunities, takes
  a risk,” she says. “I’m obviously prepared to go on trying and doing, [asking]
  can I do this? And then being surprised that yes, I can.” When she went to her
  first dance session, it was “won-der-ful!” she says, singing the word. “I
  realised that somebody was teaching me what to do, and there was music playing
  and I could let go and I felt that joy of my body moving, coming through me.”
  She progressed to Prime, Dance Base’s semi-professional company for over-60s.
  After that came funding from Luminate, Dance Base, Creative Scotland and Made
  in Scotland. For These Mechanisms, she has collaborated with the choreographer
  Robbie Synge. “It’s almost as if I’m having another career.” Along the way,
  she has learned “to listen … to find out more about myself, my capabilities.
  How to put my point of view forward, to be part of a team.” She hopes to tour
  the show overseas. In the meantime, she keeps fit. “Each morning, I hang for
  two or three minutes, take my body weight, then I turn around and hang the
  other way. Then I do some gentle stretching.” And, of course, she dances. All
  the time. “I probably dance if I am going from the fridge to the cooker,
  taking some dishes,” she says, swirling her hands in the air. “Isn’t that what
  dance is? You just have to let go and explore it.” These Mechanisms isn’t
  exactly autobiographical, but it “tells a story of persistence, of joy, of
  risk”, which sounds like Thynne. “You could do this in your 20s, you could do
  it in your 80s,” she says. “It’s about the limits of the human body and the
  desire to make things happen.” • These Mechanisms runs until 20 August at DB3
  as part of Dance Base’s fringe programme, delivered in partnership with
  Assembly festival • Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age
  of 60?
