  When a new console is released, you can always expect at least one first-party
  game designed specifically to showcase its novel features. The PlayStation 5
  had Astro’s Playroom, the Steam Deck had Aperture Desk Job, and for the
  Nintendo Switch 2 there’s Drag x Drive. Here, you play competitive wheelchair
  basketball with the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse mode (which lets you control a game
  by pushing it along a desk like a computer mouse) – rolling, jumping and
  shooting in hectic three v three bouts. A solid exhibition of a controller
  upgrade, to be sure, but Drag x Drive struggles to harness the high-octane
  nature of the real-world sport, instead delivering a shallow impersonation. As
  a basketball game, Drag x Drive demands that you spend the majority of your
  time shooting hoops and racing around the court, each Joy-Con controlling a
  single wheel on your avatar’s chair. Additionally, you can press the triggers
  to lift your wheels and jump, or raise each Joy-Con and flick to shoot your
  shot or pass the ball to a teammate. As cool as it sounds in theory, this
  doggedly practical approach isn’t as intuitive as you might expect, and,
  ironically, not very accessible either. It’s tough to find a comfortable
  position as you press and roll your palms, so it takes grit to truly master
  the control scheme. Still, if you can muscle through, there are rare spouts of
  joy to be found in hitting top speed, bashing into your opponents and taking
  possession of the ball. Some additional variety comes via the player styles
  menu, which allows you to jump between different presets based on your
  preferred approach. Alongside the balanced forward style, which splits your
  rebounding, strength and quickness skills evenly, the guard style sacrifices
  the other stats for a speed boost, and the centre position makes you slower
  but tougher. The ability to switch between styles helps smooth out the rocky
  onboarding process and allows you to freshen up the gameplay between online
  multiplayer matches, which are the key focus of the game. At a glance, Drag x
  Drive is reminiscent of vehicular football simulator Rocket League, with two
  teams battling it out to score points by pulling off trick shots and smashing
  into one another. However, where Rocket League excels with its litany of
  bouncy stadiums and explosive graphics, Drag x Drive attacks the genre with
  more restraint, trading atmospheric arenas for cold, metallic courts. There is
  some reprieve in the character customisation menu, where you can alter the
  colour of your wheels and chair, as well as choose cute headgear such as cat
  ears or old-timey driving goggles. But it’s a far cry from the warmth and
  esoteric vibrance that Nintendo is known for. Despite a lack of personality
  and wrist-cramping controls, there’s an adrenaline rush when players chase you
  that’s easy to get swept up in, especially when your momentum is dependent on
  your real-world stamina. There’s also a real sense of pride when you finally
  land a distance shot, or craft a witty assist. As your confidence grows,
  you’ll start to see the benefit of the half-pipes that flank the in-game
  court, allowing you to pull off wicked tricks and earn extra points. Suddenly,
  simple shots make way for flamboyant slam dunks, and you feel more like a pro.
  Between bouts of b-ball, there’s also a small pool of repetitive skill-honing
  side activities to engage with, including a skipping rope minigame, a shooting
  competition and an obstacle course. Excelling at these challenges and
  performing well in matches allows you to earn trophies, which unlock more
  cosmetics to jazz up your avatar’s aesthetic. Despite some efforts in
  meta-progression, it’s difficult to look past Drag x Drive’s most significant
  hurdle – that it’s uncomfortable to play for extended periods. The mouse
  controls are ingenious in theory, and when applied in small bouts, it feels
  like a novel prototype. But, in the context of such overtly active gameplay,
  the concept starts to fall apart. What remains is a surprisingly inaccessible
  sports game that lacks modal variety and a long-term hook. If you were hoping
  for a spiritual successor to the Nintendo Switch’s Rock ’Em Sock ’Em brawler
  Arms, you will be disappointed. • Drag x Drive is available now, £16.99
