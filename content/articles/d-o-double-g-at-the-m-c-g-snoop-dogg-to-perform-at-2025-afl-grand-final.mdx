  The AFL might be Australia’s indigenous game, but league officials have
  secured another international A-list performer for the entertainment at this
  year’s grand final with the announcement that American rapper Snoop Dogg will
  grace the MCG. The 53-year-old is an unusual fit with the athletic arena
  having become synonymous with marijuana during his three decades in music,
  especially given the AFL is currently wrestling with its own illicit drugs
  policy. But the Long Beach-born rapper – legally Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr
  and formerly Snoop Doggy Dogg and Snoop Lion – has entertained sports fans
  before, including the 2022 Super Bowl in California where he performed with
  fellow West Coast artists Dr Dre and Kendrick Lamar. He has developed a close
  association with elite sport in recent years, including appearing at the Paris
  Olympics where he was a special correspondent for American broadcaster NBC.
  “100,000 fans. And the two best teams. And your boy big Snoop D-O-double G at
  the M-C-G,” he said in his video announcement. “Can’t wait to see y’all in
  September for the Telstra pre-game entertainment brought to you by ... me.”
  AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon rejected concerns that the artist didn’t
  reflect Australian culture and that, as one TV reporter put it, “he’s
  gangsta”. “He’s an iconic musical act, iconic performer, he’s also really
  well-known for his collaborations,” Dillon said. “I’m sure we’ll see a lot of
  Australian talent as part of the pre-game entertainment.” The show will be
  produced by Mushroom Group, whose chief executive Matt Gudinski said
  Australian artists will also be added to the bill. “My team at Mushroom are
  currently working closely with Snoop and his team to produce an unforgettable
  spectacle, that will once again set the standard for live entertainment at
  sporting events in Australia,” he said. The performer has secured Australian
  visas in the past despite complications arising due to his criminal record –
  which includes drug and gun possession charges – and local opposition to his
  visits due to the content of his lyrics. His last tour was in 2023 when he
  played seven shows, including two at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. Snoop Dogg
  follows the appearance of pop artist Katy Perry at last year’s grand final,
  and glam rock band Kiss in 2023. “The AFL grand final is the biggest event on
  the Australian sporting calendar – and this year, it just got a whole lot
  bigger,” Dillon said. “Snoop Dogg is a pioneer, a performer, and a true
  entertainer. He’s played to packed stadiums around the world – but we think
  100,000 fans at the MCG might just be his most iconic crowd yet.”
