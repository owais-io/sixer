  Bolivians are going to the polls in an election that could mark a shift to the
  right and the end of nearly 20 years of rule by the leftist Movimiento al
  Socialismo (Mas). The party, which came to power with the first election of
  Evo Morales in 2005, risks losing its legal status if it fails to reach 3% of
  the vote – a threshold it has not hit in polls. Two opposition candidates for
  the presidency are virtually tied: the centre-right business tycoon and former
  planning minister Samuel Doria Medina, followed closely by the rightwing
  former president Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga. The incumbent president, Luis Arce, 61,
  deeply unpopular amid the country’s worst economic crisis in four decades,
  decided not to run. A finance minister under Morales for 14 years, Arce took
  control of Mas gradually in recent years. He nominated his 36-year-old
  minister of government, Eduardo del Castillo, who has been polling at about
  2%, to run for president. Morales, 65, is the target of an arrest warrant for
  allegedly fathering a child with a 15-year-old and has been entrenched in a
  coca-growing region of central Bolivia since October in an attempt to run for
  office again. After registering with another party but being barred by
  constitutional and electoral court rulings, Bolivia’s first Indigenous
  president called protests that escalated into deadly clashes with police. He
  is urging supporters to cast null votes on Sunday, claiming that if these
  outnumber the leading candidate’s tally, it would mean he had won. Carlos
  Toranzo, a political analyst, said: “Before Morales’s call, null votes were
  about 10%; now they’re 12%. Even if it rises, I doubt it will go much higher –
  and null votes have many causes, not just him.” As polls have historically
  been unreliable in Bolivia, and many voters remain undecided, Toranzo said
  there was “a small chance” that a third person could make it to a potential
  runoff against Doria Medina or Quiroga – the 36-year-old senator Andrónico
  Rodríguez. The highest-polling figure on the left, placing between third and
  fifth, Rodríguez was once seen as Morales’s natural heir due to his Indigenous
  roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union, but was called a traitor for
  launching his own candidacy. A longtime Mas member, the senator chose to leave
  the party and run with the leftwing coalition Alianza Popular – another sign
  of how fragmented the left’s vote has become. Enrique Mamani, the leader of
  the Aymara Indigenous organisation Ponchos Rojos, said he would back the
  senator, calling Morales the real traitor. “Those calling for null votes are a
  handful of traitors to the struggle of our grandparents, who shed their blood
  and gave their lives so that one day we could have this right to vote,” he
  said. On Sunday, as Rodríguez cast his vote in Entre Ríos, in the Cochabamba
  tropics – a Morales stronghold in central Bolivia – he was booed by some
  voters, who threw stones and glass bottles at the candidate. A clash broke out
  between the senator’s supporters and opponents, and he left the scene
  reportedly unharmed. Despite the incident, the president of the electoral
  court, Óscar Hassenteufel, said the elections are, overall, taking place in an
  atmosphere of “considerable calm”. About 7.9 million Bolivians are eligible to
  vote, and preliminary results are due at 9pm local time. The central issue of
  the campaign is the economic crisis, which analysts consider the worst since
  the hyperinflation of 1985, with shortages of dollars and fuel, long queues
  and soaring inflation. “It’s a very difficult moment but I hope that after
  this vote things can improve,” said Silvia Marca, 42, after casting her ballot
  in La Paz. She runs a small street business and said trade had dropped sharply
  in recent months. “I hope the right wins,” she added. If no candidate secures
  more than 50% of the vote, or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the
  runner-up, an unprecedented second round will take place on 19 October. For
  the analyst Toranzo, one thing is certain: Mas will leave power, although he
  said it will be “difficult for them to hand it over, because they have held it
  for 20 years with near-absolute control of parliament, the judiciary and the
  electoral authority”. Arce told the Guardian he would respect the result if
  the right won. Although acknowledging that his government was unpopular, he
  placed much of the blame for the crisis and Mas’s decline on his former
  mentor, Morales, whose parliamentary allies, he said, had “sabotaged and
  boycotted all our laws”. “As Fidel Castro wrote in his book, history will
  absolve us, because in the long run the people will understand everything we
  had to endure,” Arce said. “I’m sure the population will miss us afterwards.”
  On a cold Sunday morning in Bolivia’s capital, the president was greeted with
  chants of his nickname “Lucho” by about a dozen supporters as he arrived to
  cast his ballot. A voter criticised Arce and was then harassed by the group.
  “I only said to him: ‘What happened to the country, president?’ and those
  people started to attack me. I bet they are government employees,” said the
  woman, who asked not to be identified. “I know I’m not the only one in this
  country who is fed up with this government. We’re all frustrated that our
  money doesn’t stretch.” In Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the country’s commercial
  hub, Arce’s candidate was booed. According to the newspaper El Deber, Del
  Castillo reportedly skipped the queue and was told by a woman: “Get to the
  back. Line up like we do at the petrol stations.”
