  HERE. WE. GO With six new teams, 11 new managers and one storied old club
  reduced to such levels of penury by a pernicious owner that one of its unpaid
  suppliers have reportedly refused to provide sock-tape for its belatedly-paid
  players, the new Championship campaign kicks off on Friday night, with fancied
  sides Birmingham and Ipswich ready to get the first of the regular season’s
  552 games started. Of course there could end up being considerably fewer if
  Sheffield Wednesday owner Dejphon Chansiri doesn’t do the decent thing and
  sell up for a price that isn’t totally outlandish, but for now the Owls remain
  hopeful of fielding a team for their season-opener at relegated returnees
  Leicester on Sunday, even if whatever side they can cobble together is forced
  to show more leg than is considered appropriate or decent on a football pitch.
  As things stand, Wednesday fans would almost certainly be delighted if their
  club lives up to its status as hotter-than-the-sun favourites to finish bottom
  of the league come season’s end, because it would at least mean they still
  have one to support. A white-knuckle ride so unpredictable that … erm, five of
  the past six pre-season favourites have gone on to win it, the Championship
  still remains one of football’s more exciting leagues in so far as anyone in
  it can beat anyone else without it registering particularly high on the
  Richter scale. An ongoing soap opera with no ends of overlapping and
  intertwined narrative arcs and characters, this season will boast no end of
  intriguing interlopers in the form of Wrexham custodians/opportunists Ryan
  Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, Snoop Dogg sidling into the Swansea City hood and
  the Birmingham minority owner, documentary star and charisma vacuum that is
  Tom Brady. To act as a counterbalance to these intriguing sprinklings of
  stardust, of course there are more meat-and-potatoes sides of the kind
  personified by Preston. A team who took so much umbrage at a recent Big
  Website suggestion that their unremarkable, ongoing and reassuring presence in
  the second tier is to be highly commended, they failed to win any of their
  final eight games and only stayed up on the final day by the skin of their
  teeth. One imagines a mid-table finish will do just fine this time around,
  although they may struggle again. While the likes of Hull, Oxford, Charlton
  and Portsmouth are also likely to be in the scramble to avoid having to mix it
  down among the dead men, Luton’s surprise second consecutive relegation last
  season proved nobody can rest on their laurels. Having had a full pre-season
  to get his ducks in a row ahead of his first full campaign as Coventry
  manager, Frank Lampard’s fortunes seem like the kind that could veer either
  way and his many cheerleaders and detractors will inevitably be keeping a
  close eye on the table to see which half his side occupy. Following last
  season’s playoff failure he’ll be hoping his troops pull their socks up in
  time for Saturday’s opener against Hull and hoping that, unlike those of a
  certain other team, they don’t immediately fall down. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join
  Scott Murray from 8pm BST for hot Championship-opening MBM coverage of
  Birmingham City 0-0 Ipswich Town. QUOTE OF THE DAY “The Spanish keeper had
  [the research] on her bottle. So I thought when she went in goal, ‘just chuck
  it into the English fans’. Then she can’t have it! I wouldn’t put it on a
  bottle because anyone could do that. I put it on my arm. It wasn’t hard, when
  she’s gone in the goal it’s on its own, isn’t it? You just pick it up. She
  realised when she saw my bottle in there instead. She was walking back and
  looked so confused and I was trying not to burst out laughing” – Hannah
  Hampton, Ballon d’Or nominee, reveals how she befuddled Spain’s Cata Coll to
  gain an edge for the Lionesses during the Euro 2025 final penalty shootout.
  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS I was somewhat surprised to read your comment that
  Arsenal had ‘won the square root of nish-all in five years’ (yesterday’s
  Football Daily). May I join 1,056 other pedants in recalling the supreme glory
  of the men’s team in securing the Community Shield twice in that strict
  timespan (2020 and 2023). Also we must surely spotlight the even greater
  successes of the Arsenal women’s team in winning the League Cup – twice
  (2022-23 and 2023-24) - and Bigger Cup (2024-25)” – Nick Howarth Pulleyn (and
  no others). Let’s face it; Arsenal will stop Arsenal being champions. When
  William Blake wrote of ‘mind-forg’d manacles’ and the ‘marks of weakness [in
  every face I meet]’, in the poem London, he was specifically referring to the
  area between Drayton Park and Tollington Road” – Rowan Sweeney. What a
  wonderful, heartfelt paean to Son Heung-min from Michael Gilsenan (yesterday’s
  Football Daily letters). Can I suggest that Michael offers his services to Son
  as a scriptwriter? He’d surely have come up with a more enthusiastic tribute
  to LA than Son’s own half-baked effort (and, on reflection, awarding it that
  is probably being over-generous)” – Phil Taverner. As the Sonny appreciation
  society goes into overload, did you know that Harry Kane played played 435
  games for Spurs, scoring 280 goals? While Sonny played 454 games for Spurs,
  scoring 173? But Kane slotted in 63 penalties. Now, had Son been taking those
  same penalties instead, you can do the math (as they say). Simply amazing.
  What a guy” – Marc Meldrum. We often think about players joining new clubs and
  whether they’ll fit in, or will they suit their new surroundings. I see
  Anthony Stokes has joined Conor McGregor’s Black Forge FC” – Gareth Aherne. If
