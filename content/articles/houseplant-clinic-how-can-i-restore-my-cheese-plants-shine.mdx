  What’s the problem? My Swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa) has survived
  for years, but recently the leaves have become dull and lost their gloss.
  Diagnosis Swiss cheese plants are renowned for their lush, naturally glossy
  leaves. However, they can lose their sheen because of dust accumulation,
  unsuitable potting conditions, or stress, often linked to watering habits or
  inadequate nutrients. Prescription Repot your plant into well-draining compost
  enriched with organic matter and perlite or bark chips. Regularly wipe the
  leaves gently with a damp cloth. Ensure consistent watering, only when the top
  inch of soil feels dry to the touch. And ensure the plant is exposed to
  bright, indirect light to support healthy growth. Prevention Gently dust the
  leaves every few weeks, and keep your plant well fed with occasional doses of
  diluted liquid fertiliser during the growing season. With suitable soil,
  proper watering, good airflow and careful cleaning, your Swiss cheese plant
  should regain its natural, healthy glossiness. Got a plant dilemma? Email
