  The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is not telling the truth about the
  “real failures of 14 years of Conservative government”, the former
  Conservative prime minister Liz Truss has said. Writing in the Telegraph,
  Truss said: “In a recent speech Kemi said: ‘From now on, we are going to be
  telling the British people the truth even when it is difficult to hear.’ If
  she’s not willing to tell the truth to her own supporters, the Conservative
  party is in serious trouble.” Truss’s comments came after Badenoch’s own
  Telegraph article in which she claimed the current Labour government was
  failing to heed the warnings of the disastrous mini-budget that defined
  Truss’s short-lived premiership. The former prime minister has been fighting a
  desperate battle to rewrite the narrative around her 45 days in office in
  2022. She released a memoir and embarked on a campaign tour that allowed her
  to talk up her record and offer her views on the political landscape in the UK
  and US. In her Telegraph article, she claimed her mini-budget would have
  helped the UK escape a “doom-loop” of low growth and high taxes. “Yet, it was
  sabotaged by the Bank of England and the Treasury – which didn’t want to be
  challenged and wanted to cover up their failings – and Conservative MPs who
  either didn’t believe in supply-side economics or cravenly wanted preferment
  under a Sunak premiership.” But Truss has faced an uphill battle – not least
  when she was mocked by the campaign group Led By Donkeys, which unfurled a
  banner during one of her appearances bearing the phrase: “I crashed the
  economy.” It also included a picture of a lettuce – a reference to a Daily
  Star livestream stunt that sought to determine whether Truss’s battle to
  survive in No 10 could last longer than a 60p iceberg lettuce from Tesco.
  Illustrating her criticism of the current Labour government, Badenoch invoked
  Truss’s failures in No 10. “Picture the scene: a new prime minister and
  chancellor spending billions without also making the necessary savings to
  offset their splurge and balance the books. The markets react adversely,
  interest rates spike and the cost of living gets worse with prices soaring.
  “For all their mocking of Liz Truss, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have not
  learnt the lessons of the mini-budget and are making even bigger mistakes,”
  she wrote in the Telegraph on Saturday. Hitting back, Truss wrote: “She is
  wrong. Labour is doing the opposite of the mini-budget, which is why the
  country is headed for disaster.” And listing several policy recommendations
  that place her close to the US president, Donald Trump, politically, Truss
  added: “It is disappointing that, instead of serious thinking like this, Kemi
  Badenoch is instead repeating spurious narratives. I suspect she is doing this
  to divert from the real failures of 14 years of Conservative government in
  which her supporters are particularly implicated.”
