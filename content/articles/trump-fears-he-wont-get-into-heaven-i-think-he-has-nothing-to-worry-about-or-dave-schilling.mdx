  “Will Donald Trump get into heaven?” I know this is a question weighing
  heavily on your mind right now. The current president of the United States is
  79 years old, so we don’t have much time left to sort this one out. Trump
  clearly has eternity at the top of his agenda, having spoken on at least two
  occasions about what happens when we die. He called into a radio program
  called the Todd Starnes Show, which is a thing people listen to when the
  internet is out on their block. He waxed on about his military deployment in
  Washington DC, but also about the possible system that decides the fate of
  your everlasting soul. “There has to be some kind of a report card up there
  someplace, y’know, like: ‘Let’s go to heaven, let’s get into heaven.’ It’s
  sort of a beautiful thing,” he said to Starnes. He’s probably hoping they
  grade on a curve. On Fox News, Trump expressed serious doubt he’s going to get
  called up to the big leagues of life after death. “I want to try and get to
  heaven if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I’m really at the bottom
  of the totem pole.” I don’t know who he’s hearing this from. Is there a
  Quinnipiac poll I haven’t read? Has Steve Kornacki weighed in from the MSNBC
  (sorry, MS Now) big board? Unfortunately, the choice is out of my hands. The
  afterlife is not exactly a democracy. According to the Catholic church, only
  God himself can cast a ballot. Even St Peter doesn’t get a say, though I was
  told that’s because he always forgets to bring his driver’s license to the
  polling place. If things get dicey for the president, he can always sue. The
  supreme court is open to hearing his arguments. It’s understandable that the
  man is publicly pondering the results of his nearly eight decades of acting
  almost exclusively in his own best interest, as a real estate mogul, reality
  TV star, WWE Hall of Famer, steak salesman, McDonald’s aficionado, and Cats
  enthusiast. The latter should be enough to get him booted downstairs, but
  again, I don’t get to decide. Bad taste is not disqualifying in the eyes of
  the Lord, which is why I’m positive Ed Hardy and Damien Hirst still have a
  shot at it. Deep down, even the most hardened atheist probably hopes that
  heaven exists, that there’s a punter’s chance we can frolic in the clouds
  wearing resplendent robes and play the harp all day. The alternatives – a
  fiery nightmare or the yawning void of nothing – aren’t so pleasant. I’m more
  than a few years the president’s junior, so I hopefully have a bit longer
  before I get the answer to the ultimate question, but it’s never too early to
  plan for the future. I also want to get into heaven, but I don’t have a clue
  how to go about doing it. So I did what any sensible human being would do when
  faced with a test they didn’t study for. I asked ChatGPT. As soon as I asked,
  my computer fan went into overdrive. The battery also started emitting a toxic
  stench that not only repelled my dog, but also caused my neighbors to break
  down my door to make sure I wasn’t quietly decaying in my living room. After
  the smell died down, I got back to work. ChatGPT squirted out a brief summary
  of all the major religions’ stances on heavenly prerequisites. Besides the
  obvious ones, such as faith in God, the to-dos read suspiciously like a
  college application. You need to do charity work, study and donate a million
  dollars to the alumni foundation. Easy stuff. ChatGPT wrapped up with some
  final “thoughts” on the matter, which didn’t much clarify the practical steps
  necessary to earn the all-you-can-eat buffet in the sky. “In many traditions,
  the emphasis isn’t just on ‘getting into heaven,’ but on living a life of
  compassion, integrity, and faith. While paths differ, a common thread in many
  religions is the importance of love, kindness, and striving to become the best
  version of oneself.” I guess I’ll do my best, but I can count at least five
  times where I didn’t let everyone exit the elevator before I got on or forgot
  to send a gift to a newlywed couple. I might be screwed. And if I’m screwed,
  how will Trump fare? In this moment of pessimism for our dear leader, I
  figured I should follow in his footsteps, ignore evidence I don’t want to hear
  and find a more sympathetic source. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association
  has a helpful article entitled “How Can I Know for Sure I’ll Go to Heaven?”
  Almost immediately, I was comforted. Graham is quoted as saying: “Your
  salvation depends on what [Christ] has done for you, not on what you do for
  Him. It isn’t your hold on God that saves you; it’s His hold on you.” I’ve
  seen enough. I’m pretty sure I understand all I need to know about saving
  myself from the cursed lash of the dark lord Lucifer. I don’t have to do
  anything. Full stop. Instead of thinking about how I behave, how I treat
  others, or what heavy responsibility I must carry in the corporeal world, I
  just need to check in to see how many goodies God has sent my way so far. Just
  like being a child, you know if your parents love you based on how many toys
  they purchase and how expensive they are. I drive an Audi, so I think I’m
  probably on the nice list. The article continues: “You can be a loving person,
  a good person, and even volunteer of the year, but it’ll never be good
  enough.” Perfect. I don’t even volunteer to help with my son’s homework, I’m
  riddled with credit card debt and take far too long to clip my toenails.
  Doesn’t sound like I need to try any harder than “pays the absolute minimum
  monthly amount” and “trims directly on to the floor of the bathroom, which my
  girlfriend has repeatedly asked me to not do”. If we’re to use Billy Graham’s
  words as a guide, Donald Trump is going to make it upstairs. The only real
  requirement is that you have to have a personal relationship with God. He has
  a lot of money, which means God loves him. Eternity, like business, is all
  about networking. And who’s a better networker than Donald J Trump? Even if
  Trump doesn’t have God’s personal cellphone number, I’m sure he can ask his
  friends at the FBI to find it. Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer
  and humorist
