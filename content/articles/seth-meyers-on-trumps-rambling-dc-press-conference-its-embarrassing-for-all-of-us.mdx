  With most late-night hosts on holiday, Seth Meyers recaps Donald Trump’s
  rambling and factually inaccurate press conference about crime in Washington
  DC. Seth Meyers Donald Trump loves to make up numbers, from his false job
  statistics, to his arbitrary tariffs to his claim to lower prescription drug
  prices by an impossible “1500%”. “Trump has no shame, so he just keeps rolling
  with his made-up numbers,” said Seth Meyers on Monday’s Late Night, hours
  after Trump used bogus crime statistics as a justification for deploying the
  national guard in Washington DC. The federal takeover of the capital’s police
  force was based on “numbers that once again make no sense”, said Meyers. “And
  you don’t have to take it from me. CNN factchecked him live as he was talking”
  with graphics confirming that violent crime is down 26% from the year prior,
  and 35% from the year before that. “We’ve had presidents who’ve lied before
  but we’ve never had a president who was this easy to factcheck,” said Meyers.
  “Who are you going to believe, the stats on the CNN or the guy who says he can
  lower drug prices by 1500%?” Trump’s press conference announcing the takeover
  was “as with all things Trump, entirely for show”, Meyers continued. “And the
  way you know that is that the very first words he uttered were not about
  crime, but about his dream to build a new ballroom in the White House.” After
  Trump’s diversion into his desire to build a giant gold ballroom in the White
  House, he showed some charts with “statistics” on local crime and just said:
  “OK?” “Is this his new catchphrase now? He’s just going to hold up a chart and
  say ‘OK?’” Meyers laughed. “He’s like a lazy magician who doesn’t make you
  take a card, he just holds one up and acts like that’s what it was gonna be.’”
  Trump talked about DC “like it was a dystopian hellhole out of a steampunk
  novel”. The city, he said, was “taken over by violent gangs and bloodthirsty
  criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,
  caravans of mass youth rampage through city streets, they’re on ATV,
  motorbikes, they travel pretty well”. “So clearly what happened is: he fell
  asleep watching Fox News, rolled over on the remote, accidentally changed the
  channel to HBO, woke up and saw Mad Max: Fury Road and thought it was still
  the news,” said Meyers. Asked by a reporter how the crackdown on crime squared
  with his administration’s reported plan to reclassify marijuana, Trump
  answered: “We’re looking at it.” “Are you guys looking at it, or smoking it
  like five times a day?” Meyers wondered. Marijuana use “might also explain why
  Trump doesn’t even seem to know where he is or where he’s going on a daily
  basis”, he added, as during the conference, Trump claimed to be going to
  Russia on Friday to meet with Vladimir Putin, when he’s actually meeting with
  the Russian president in Alaska. “Oh fuck, did you already give away Alaska?”
  Meyers joked. “I can’t wait to see the news report from that meeting. The US
  has struck an agreement with Russia in which Russia will give back the land it
  stole from Ukraine and the US in return will give Russia several states
  including Alaska, Rhode Island and New Jersey.” “Ultimately, I think most of
  the Trump press conference could be summed up this way,” said Meyers, cutting
  to a clip of Trump saying “we’re formally declaring a public safety emergency
  … and it’s embarrassing for me to be up here.” “Yes,” Meyers confirmed. “In a
  way, it’s embarrassing for all of us.”
