  Trent Alexander-Arnold will make a swift return to Anfield after his new club,
  Real Madrid, were drawn to face Liverpool again in this season’s Champions
  League. The right-back will meet his former teammates months after his
  controversial move to the Bernabéu, which drew vocal disapproval from sections
  of the Liverpool support towards the end of last season. Alexander-Arnold, an
  academy product who spent two decades on the club’s books, was booed at the
  match against Arsenal in May after announcing that he would leave upon the
  expiry of his contract. Reunions were a running theme in the now customary
  sprawling draw, which paired each of the 36 contenders with eight league phase
  opponents and included a record six Premier League clubs. Kevin De Bruyne
  should receive a warm welcome to the Etihad when he comes back with Napoli;
  the Serie A winners will also host Chelsea in a tie that pits Antonio Conte
  against one of his former clubs. Arsenal will prime themselves for the latest
  appearance of Harry Kane, a long-time nemesis while at Spurs, in Bayern Munich
  colours at the Emirates. The Manchester City director of football, Hugo Viana,
  hailed De Bruyne’s imminent return. The Belgian departed during the summer
  after winning 16 major trophies in a glittering 10 years at City. “I think Pep
  [Guardiola] and all of his colleagues will be really happy to receive him and
  our fans will be also,” he said. “It will be very exciting and we will be very
  happy to see him again.” Liverpool will bring up a Madrid double, with Real’s
  city rivals Atlético also travelling to Merseyside. Softer-looking tasks
  against PSV and Qarabag, the champions of Azerbaijan, complete their home
  schedule; they will travel to Inter, Eintracht Frankfurt, Marseille and
  Galatasaray. Arne Slot’s side beat Real 2-0 a the same stage last November and
  the manager called their imminent rematch “a fixture that the whole world will
  be looking at”. City will renew acquaintances with Real, who they have faced
  10 times in the past five and a half years. Real most recently defeated them
  6-3 on aggregate in February’s knock out playoff round and will host this tie.
  City will also visit newcomers Bodø/Glimt, Villarreal and Monaco; Guardiola’s
  side will host Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Galarasaray along with
  Napoli. Arsenal will look to banish the memory of a Kane penalty at the
  Emirates in April 2024 that contributed to Bayern’s victory in that season’s
  quarter-finals. Atlético, Olympiacos and the Kazakhstani debutants Kairat
  Almaty will also visit north London; Arsenal, semi-finalists in 2024-25, will
  visit Inter, Club Brugge, Slavia Prague and Athletic Bilbao. “For me, it’s a
  moment where Arsenal can be competitive again and just go that one step
  further,” said Theo Walcott, present at the ceremony in Monte Carlo in his
  capacity as a club ambassador. Chelsea remain aglow from their Conference
  League and Club World Cup successes but face a relatively tough-looking path
  through the league phase. They will meet Barcelona, Benfica, Ajax and the
  Cypriot first-timers Pafos at Stamford Bridge, playing away ties with Bayern,
  Atalanta, Qarabag and Conte’s impressive Napoli. The vogue for reigniting old
  relationships continues with Tottenham’s journey inside the arctic circle to
  meet Bodø/Glimt, with their victory over the Norwegian club in May’s Europa
  League semi-finals still a happy memory. Spurs also face the reigning
  champions, Paris Saint-Germain, who edged them out on penalties in the Super
  Cup a fortnight ago, at Parc des Princes. Their assignments on the road also
  include Eintracht, another opponent from 2024-25, and Monaco. Thomas Frank’s
  team host Borussia Dortmund, Villarreal, Slavia Prague and FC Copenhagen from
  his homeland. There will be few easy assignments for Newcastle, particularly
  if they find themselves shorn of Alexander Isak. St James’ Park will play host
  to Barcelona, Benfica, PSV and Athletic; their fans will await trips to PSG,
  Bayer Leverkusen, Marseille and Union Saint-Gilloise. They defeated PSG 4-1 at
  home and drew 1-1 away in the 2023-24 group stage. Other noteworthy clashes
  include a rerun of the 2021 final between PSG and Bayern, along with an epic
  trip to the Kazakh capital for Real when they face Kairat. The first set of
  games will take place between 16 and 18 September; five subsequent rounds are
  scheduled before mid-December, with two more lined up for January. The order
  of the fixtures, along with dates and kick-off times, will be released on
  Saturday.
