  Coming out as gay was not something Willis Austin Chimano, a member of the
  Kenyan Afropop band Sauti Sol, had ever considered. From about 2005, when the
  group – widely considered to be Africa’s biggest boyband – was formed, to
  2018, Chimano says he “wore a mask” at work, careful how he acted, spoke and
  dressed. At the same time, he embraced his queer identity in his private life.
  “I had to do everything in my power to keep my sexuality hidden,” he says. His
  band mates knew, and supported him, but Chimano thought he would not be
  accepted by the wider public. “I was scared that it could ruin our chances at
  becoming bigger. “I just wanted to keep a clean representation of me,” he
  says. “My queerness would have been a scandal.” Then, in 2018, a photograph of
  him with his partner was posted on social media and republished by the
  mainstream media in Kenya. He was the first pop star in Kenya to be outed as
  gay – and social media went wild. “There was vitriol, oh my God, so much,”
  Chimano recalls. “People were saying ‘you’re a sinner’, ‘it goes against the
  laws of nature’, ‘it’s against African culture’. There’s a larger society
  belief that what [queer people] are doing is wrong. People don’t understand.”
  Kenya is one of 31 countries in Africa that still criminalises queer people.
  Gay sex is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. A challenge to the
  colonial-era law, introduced by the British, was rejected by the high court in
  2019. Many members of the queer community are shunned by their families in
  this deeply religious country. Currently, the Kenyan MP Peter Kaluma is urging
  parliament to advance the family protection bill 2023, which aims to outlaw
  same-sex relationships, LGBTQ+ activities, public cross-dressing and related
  advocacy campaigns. In neighbouring Uganda, the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+
  bill, which allows the death penalty for homosexual acts, was signed into law
  in 2023. Chimano publicly said for the first time in the media that he was
  part of the queer community in 2021. Despite his fears, Sauti Sol went from
  strength to strength. The group signed a deal with Universal, their album
  performed well, and the last single they released was their biggest ever.
  However, when it came to performing as a solo artist, Chimano was, at times,
  confronted with a different reality. He had started writing his own songs to
  come to terms with the turbulence of the last few years. “I needed to get
  through some of my hang-ups and a bit of my trauma and just fix myself, in a
  way,” he says. He released an EP, Heavy is the Crown, in 2022, at a time when
  Sauti Sol was exploring taking a break so members could pursue solo
  opportunities. Before its release, in February that year, he was due to appear
  at a festival he had organised called Love and Harmony, but it was shut down.
  “The cops were just like, ‘Oh, you’re coming here to do a gay event in my
  jurisdiction and we’re not going to allow that to ever happen.’” His team
  found another venue – a shopping centre – in a different area of Nairobi. But
  as he was heading to rehearsal, Chimano remembers seeing more police trucks on
  the road than normal. Midway through the practice, he was called into a room
  and told the show was off. Police officers carrying AK-47s had been sent to
  the venue. In Chimano’s opinion, it was to intimidate him. “The message was
  that we could go ahead and set up and go on with the show, but that we should
  prepare for the consequences,” he says. “They were walking around with their
  guns and looking intimidating. “I was in shock, naturally. Something switched
  in me and I walked outside, sat and stared at a wall. Then I broke down.” He
  wrote on X: “Bullies never win! You may have gotten your way this time. You’ve
  only made my resolve stronger … The show that I’ve been working so hard on
  will be seen. That is a fact!” An accompanying statement said the show had
  been called off by the police for “security reasons”. The next time he
  performed a solo show was months later when he was hired as a performer for a
  corporate event. They asked him how his set would look, right down to what the
  dancers would be wearing. “I took it as, ‘Hopefully, it’s not too gay?’ … They
  were asking questions just to make sure there was nothing camp about it,” he
  says. After a lot of back and forth, the show went well. Since Sauti Sol
  officially announced their hiatus in 2023, Chimano has been working on a
  one-man show with songs from his EP, which has taken him to Australia, France
  and the UK, where he performed in London and Cardiff as part of the ongoing
  UK-Kenya Season of Culture, organised by London’s Africa Centre and the
  British Council. With each performance, the show continues to evolve, making
  space for experimentation and emotional discovery. He hopes to perform a
  version of it in Kenya in future. He has also been writing a memoir, which he
  hopes to publish next year, and a debut album, due for release sometime in
  2026. Meanwhile, Chimano has been a source of inspiration for members of the
  queer community and their family across Africa. Through his music, writing and
  art, he has taken on the role of advocating for the queer community. He is
  part of a movement of people “who are expressing themselves more and being out
  there”, Chimano says. He remains hopeful for the future; and is positive that
  the law criminalising the queer community in Kenya will be repealed at some
  point. “There’s a lot more straight people who have friends in the queer
  community and I hope when the time comes, when we’re talking about allyship,
  they speak up and show up for us,” he says.
