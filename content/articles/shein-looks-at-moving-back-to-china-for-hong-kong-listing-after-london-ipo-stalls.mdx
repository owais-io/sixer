  The online fashion retailer Shein is understood to be considering moving its
  base back to China from Singapore to pave the way for a Hong Kong listing. The
  business, which was founded in China and moved its headquarters to Singapore
  in 2022, had been considering a £50bn float in London after failing to win
  approval from regulators in the US for a New York flotation. However, Chinese
  authorities have not given the nod to a UK listing and the fast-fashion group
  has faced questions about conditions in its supply chain from campaigners,
  influential British MPs and investors. The company is subject to oversight by
  Chinese regulators despite being officially based in Singapore because the
  China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) requires all companies with
  substantial links to the country to clear a review before listing shares
  anywhere in the world. Shein still makes most of its clothing in China. It has
  consulted lawyers about setting up a parent company in mainland China,
  according to a Bloomberg report, indicating that the company is now most
  likely to list in Hong Kong. Melanie Tng, a private capital analyst for the
  venture capital research firm PitchBook, said: “For companies like Shein that
  are operating at the intersection of consumer, cross-border and digital
  commerce, Hong Kong is arguably the only viable major offshore listing venue
  left. “Mainland exchanges remain largely inaccessible to these sectors, while
  US and UK IPOs have grown increasingly difficult due to CSRC approval hurdles
  and geopolitical friction.” The latest effort to secure a listing comes as
  prospects for growth at the company have been dampened by new restrictions on
  the import of low-value goods to the US. The restrictions are poised to be
  tightened again next week after Shein and Temu, another online marketplace
  founded in China, were seen to have benefited from them at the cost of local
  retailers. In May the US revoked its de minimis exception for Chinese-made
  goods, under which parcels with a value of less than $800 (£600) shipped to
  individuals were exempt from import tax. The US recently announced plans to
  scrap the tax break for items from all countries next week. The EU said in
  February it would phase out its exemption on customs duties for low-value
  parcels and the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has also said she was reviewing
  the country’s version of the rule. However, recent figures for the British
  market indicate rapid growth last year. Shein’s UK arm increased sales by
  about a third to more than £2bn, overtaking its British rival Boohoo and
  closing in on Asos, according to accounts filed at Companies House last week.
  Shein said profits rose 56% to £38.2m last year, on which it paid £9.6m
  corporation tax. Shein declined to comment.
