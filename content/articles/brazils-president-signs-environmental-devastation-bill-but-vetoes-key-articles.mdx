  Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has signed into law a
  controversial bill that scientists and environmentalists had dubbed the
  “devastation bill”, but vetoed key articles that would have in effect
  dismantled the country’s environmental licensing system. On Friday, the final
  day to either sanction or veto the law, Lula struck down or amended 63 of the
  398 provisions in a bill that, as approved by congress last month, had been
  regarded as the most significant setback to Brazil’s environmental protections
  in four decades. Environmental campaigners had urged the president to veto the
  bill in its entirety, but many welcomed Lula’s decision and are now calling on
  civil society to mobilise to pressure lawmakers into upholding the vetoes.
  That will not be an easy task for the Lula administration, given that the
  largely opposition-controlled congress has repeatedly defeated key government
  proposals – including by overturning previous presidential vetoes. An
  escalating political standoff further complicates the challenge: lawmakers
  aligned with former president Jair Bolsonaro are blocking legislative
  activity, demanding the passage of a bill granting amnesty to the far-right
  leader and hundreds of others accused of taking part in a failed coup attempt
  in 2022. Lula’s ministers – speaking at a press conference in the capital
  Brasília in the president’s absence – expressed confidence in the government’s
  position. After Congress approved the bill last month, the environment
  minister, Marina Silva, described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing
  framework, saying that it threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate
  deforestation by 2030. But on Friday, she said the revised legislation meant
  that “our targets to reach zero deforestation, and our goal to cut CO2
  emissions by between 59% and 67%, remain fully on track”. One of the most
  heavily criticised provisions of the bill would have allowed projects
  classified as having “medium” environmental impact to obtain licences through
  a self-declared online form – without prior studies or regulatory review. That
  clause was among those vetoed, as was another that would have excluded most of
  the Indigenous and Quilombola communities from having a say in licensing
  decisions affecting their territories. Lula, however, preserved a provision
  allowing the federal government to fast-track “strategic” or “priority”
  projects – a move that could pave the way for oil exploration at the mouth of
  the Amazon River. The project has been championed by the president, but
  heavily criticised by environmentalists. Groups such as the NGO SOS Mata
  Atlântica welcomed the vetoes, but said they would carry out a detailed review
  of both the discarded and remaining provisions “to continue mobilising civil
  society and ensure that congress upholds the gains secured”. ActionAid’s
  climate justice specialist, Jessica Siviero, said that “a full veto was
  essential, but the points that were struck down still represent progress”.
  Mighty Earth’s global director, João Gonçalves, also welcomed Lula’s vetoes
  and said he hoped congress would uphold them, warning that “if this
  destructive bill becomes law – just weeks ahead of Cop30 in Belém – it
  threatens to erode Brazil’s credibility on the global stage.” At Friday’s
  press conference, Lula’s ministers appeared careful not to criticise congress,
  stating that there were “positive” elements in the bill, which had been backed
  by agribusiness and mining interests as a way to “cut red tape” and “speed up”
  licensing procedures. “We hope to be able to streamline licensing processes
  without compromising their quality, which is essential for environmental
  protection at a time of climate crisis, biodiversity loss and
  desertification,” said Silva. Should Congress overturn the president’s vetoes,
  environmentalists and legal experts have warned the move could trigger a wave
  of lawsuits – both challenging the legislation itself and contesting projects
  approved through self-licensing – on the grounds that they violate Brazil’s
  constitution.
