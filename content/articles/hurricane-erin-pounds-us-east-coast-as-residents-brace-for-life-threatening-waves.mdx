  Hurricane Erin’s arrival is being felt all along the east coast, where higher
  tides and powerful surf have triggered expanded warnings for flooding and
  tropical storm conditions. Coastal residents are bracing for the possibility
  of a dangerous storm surge reaching up to 4ft (1.2 metres), along with severe
  beach erosion. The hurricane is expected to generate “life-threatening” waves
  ranging from 15 to 20ft, with North Carolina beaches anticipating the most
  brutal waves. The pounding of shorelines will last for two days or longer as
  Erin slowly moves north offshore through at least Thursday. Authorities have
  urged people to stay out of the ocean throughout the east coast. On Tuesday,
  the storm system’s strength dipped to about 100mph (160km/h) as winds cut
  across its north side. But the National Hurricane Center reported early on
  Wednesday that the storm rebuilt an inner eye wall. “Swells generated by Erin
  will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and
  Atlantic Canada during the next several days,” said the National Hurricane
  Center. “These rough ocean conditions are expected to cause life-threatening
  surf and rip currents.” Officials in New York City said swimming would be
  prohibited at city beaches on Wednesday and Thursday because of the
  treacherous currents from Erin. The National Weather Service put Suffolk and
  Nassau county beaches on a coastal flood watch. In New Jersey and Delaware,
  beach closures began on Tuesday and are expected to extend until Friday or
  later in the week. While forecasts show the hurricane eventually steering away
  from land, the National Weather Service cautioned that beaches from Florida to
  New York face a high risk of rip currents through Wednesday evening. Along the
  Outer Banks, conditions began to deteriorate on Tuesday despite Erin still
  being more than 500 miles (805km) offshore. Parts were under mandatory
  evacuation orders and a declared state of emergency. In Buxton, incoming
  afternoon tides pushed waves under beachfront homes on stilts and swept water
  across sections of Highway 12, the islands’ main roadway. The northern areas
  around Nags Head and Kill Devil Hills, home to the region’s densest
  development, are outside the evacuation zone. But to the south, across Oregon
  Inlet, lies Hatteras Island, which relies solely on Highway 12 for access.
  Beyond that is Ocracoke Island, which can only be reached by plane or ferry.
  Hurricane Erin’s rapid growth ranks it among the fastest-intensifying
  hurricanes ever observed in the Atlantic, highlighting scientists’ warnings
  that the climate crisis, driven by greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans,
  is fueling more rapid storm strengthening.
