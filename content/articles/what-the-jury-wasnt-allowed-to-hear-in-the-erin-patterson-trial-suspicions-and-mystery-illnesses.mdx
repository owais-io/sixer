  Simon Patterson told his father, Don, and other family members that he
  suspected his estranged wife, Erin Patterson, had been trying to poison him
  before she invited his parents and his aunt and uncle to a fatal beef
  wellington lunch, according to evidence heard in a pre-trial hearing. One
  argument heard in court, but not able to be revealed to the jury in Erin
  Patterson’s triple murder trial, involved police suspicions that she might
  have previously used rat poison in an alleged attempt to kill Simon. On 7
  July, Patterson was found guilty of murdering Simon’s parents, Don and Gail
  Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, and guilty of attempting to murder
  Heather’s husband, Ian Wilkinson. On Friday an interim suppression order
  prohibiting Australian media from reporting on any evidentiary rulings made in
  pre-trial hearings and during the trial was lifted, after a coalition of media
  organisations, including Guardian Australia, successfully challenged the
  order. The lifting of the order, which was imposed immediately after the
  guilty verdicts by the supreme court trial’s judge, Justice Christopher Beale,
  means material and claims that jurors were not allowed to hear can now be made
  public. Patterson, 50, appeared via video link on Friday morning. Justice
  Beale said that a plea hearing in her case – when the prosecution and defence
  make submissions about her sentence – would be held across two days starting
  25 August. When he asked Jane Warren, for the Office of Public Prosecutions,
  how many victim impact statements were expected, she responded “all I can say
  is a lot, your honour”. Beale then made rulings about the material which could
  be published, including a redacted video of the interview Patterson did with
  police in August 2023, a week after the lunch and that was played to jurors
  during the trial. Other material was heard in pre-trial hearings but excluded
  from evidence put before the jury as it was ruled unfairly prejudicial to
  Patterson. Patterson did not speak during the brief hearing, other than to
  confirm shortly before it started that she could see and hear the court. Her
  lawyers are required to file their submissions regarding her sentence by 18
  August, with prosecution submissions – including victim impact statements –
  due four days later. Pre-trial hearings allow the accused to test the
  reliability of evidence before trial, and for rulings to be made by a judge
  which are designed to ensure the fairness of that trial. These hearings in
  Patterson’s case involved dozens of witnesses and were held in the Victorian
  supreme court over several months in 2024. The hearings typically involved
  lawyers for Patterson questioning these witnesses about statements they made
  to police. These statements and other evidence relied upon during these
  hearings were not released to the media. Some of the evidence that did not
  make it from these hearings to the trial related to separate charges alleging
  that Patterson had attempted to murder Simon, which were later dropped. In
  pre-trial hearings and the trial itself some evidence was ruled inadmissible
  by Beale as it was deemed unfairly prejudicial to Patterson. Reporting on
  inadmissible evidence is not permitted until after the jury has reached a
  verdict. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The prosecution
  sought to have three charges of attempted murder against Erin Patterson
  involving Simon in 2021 and 2022 heard at the same time as three charges of
  murder and a charge of attempted murder relating to the 29 July 2023 beef
  wellington lunch Patterson served at her home at Leongatha, in regional
  Australia. But Beale ruled on 14 March 2025 that the two sets of charges,
  referred to as the “Simon charges” and the “lunch charges”, would have to be
  heard separately. The DPP unsuccessfully appealed to the court of appeal, and
  then decided to drop the attempted murder charges relating to Simon. In his
  March decision, before the trial, Beale made six rulings. These rulings
  included: that all evidence of the computer records on devices seized from the
  home of Patterson concerning access to, or possible access to, information on
  poisons be excluded, apart from one document; that cell phone tower evidence
  concerning alleged visits by Patterson to Loch and Outtrim be admitted; that
  so-called tendency evidence be excluded as it lacked “significant probative
  value”; that most evidence about alleged incriminating conduct be admitted;
  and that some evidence about hearsay evidence would be admitted. Ruling six
  related to “coincidence evidence”, which was excluded. “As a consequence I
  have ordered severance in relation to what I will describe as the two
  matters,” Beale said in March. “On the one hand, Charges 1 to 3, which are
  charges of attempted murder in relation to Simon Patterson, and, on the other
  hand, Charges 4 to 7, which is one charge of attempted murder in relation to
  Ian Wilkinson and three charges of murder in relation to the other guests. I
  order that that be a separate trial.” Neither Beale’s reasons for ruling out
  evidence at the pre-trial hearings nor the written submissions made by the
  prosecution and defence in relation to which evidence should be admissible
  have been made public. Given the “Simon charges” were dropped, the evidence
  related to them remains untested. Simon Patterson’s suspicions During a
  hearing before the court of appeal in April 2024, prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC
  said that police uncovered digital forensic evidence from a computer seized at
  Patterson’s home relating to an article about barium carbonate, which is
  commonly used as rat poison. She said that Prof Andrew Burston, an intensive
  care specialist who reviewed Simon’s medical records, found that one of
  Simon’s admissions to hospital that was suspected of being linked to Patterson
  was “consistent” with barium carbonate poisoning. Rogers qualified during the
  court of appeal hearing that this evidence had not been put to Beale in the
  supreme court pre-trial hearings. Rogers told the court that Burston found no
  definitive cause for the illnesses affecting Simon’s stomach and bowel. The
  three attempted murder charges related to the only times the prosecution say
  that Patterson went away with Simon, without their children, since they
  separated in 2015, Rogers said, adding that police also investigated a fourth
  time that Simon fell unwell, but Patterson was not charged in relation to
  this. The prosecution sought to combine the three Simon charges and the July
  2023 lunch as four events over a 20-month period where they alleged that
  Patterson poisoned people she prepared food for. It was not alleged that
  Patterson used death cap mushrooms in any of the food prepared for Simon,
  which Rogers told the court included pasta, curry, and a wrap. Colin Mandy SC,
  for Patterson, told the court of appeal that none of the coincidences relied
  upon by the prosecution to join the Simon charges and the lunch charges were
  remarkable enough to warrant them being admitted. These alleged coincidences
  between the lunch and Simon charges included that Patterson prepared the
  meals, controlled who ate them, and poisoned the food. Mandy said that
  Patterson prepared food for Simon “countless” times without him becoming
  unwell. There was also evidence Simon may have become unwell before eating
  food prepared by Patterson in relation to one of the charges, and a
  possibility that he initiated some of the trips away with her, Mandy said,
  rather than them having been arranged by the accused. The court of appeal
  should consider, Mandy said, “how different these two trials are in terms of
  body of evidence”. He said the lunch charges “were in a very different
  category” to the Simon charges, with an “extensive body of evidence” to be led
  by the prosecution. The prosecution accepted that there was less evidence that
  was relied upon for the “Simon charges” than the “lunch charges”. Simon told
  pre-trial hearings that after his repeated hospital admissions, extended
  family members said to him they were “wondering if Erin had been poisoning
  me”. He said he came to the same conclusion after meeting with his GP and
  being asked to prepare a summary of everything that happened immediately
  before he was hospitalised. He told the court that he found the common
  denominator was eating food prepared by Patterson, and not eaten by anyone
  else, immediately prior to falling ill. Mandy asked Simon during a pre-trial
  hearing in October 2024 whether he “believed, and continue to believe, you
  fell ill because of food Erin had prepared for you?” “Yes,” he responded.
  Mandy then asked if Simon agreed with the proposition that before the end of
  2022 “there was nothing untoward about the relationship between you and Erin?”
  “If by ‘nothing untoward’, you mean anything that would make me think she
  would try and kill me, correct,” Simon responded. Doctor told court he thought
  it ‘feasible’ Erin was poisoning Simon Much of the evidence about Simon’s
  suspicions was raised in a pre-trial hearing in August 2024. His GP, Dr
  Christopher Ford, told the court that it was during a 55-minute consultation
  on 21 February 2023, that he and Simon discussed these poisoning concerns.
  Ford and the Patterson family attended the Korumburra Baptist church, where
  Ian Wilkinson was the pastor, and Ford said he had become friends with Simon.
  At an earlier appointment, Ford said that he asked Simon to record the details
  of what had happened immediately before he was admitted to hospital. Ford said
  Simon reached the conclusion Patterson was using food to poison him. “I asked
  him to do that because I couldn’t understand why … these things kept on
  happening to him in such a way that he had essentially almost had three near
  death experiences,” Ford told the court. “It didn’t fit into any of my medical
  models that would account for all three of those things. “There was no other
  reasons that could fit all the different admissions, so it seemed feasible it
  could be a possible reason.” Simon had been so unwell he had to have part of
  his bowel removed, the court heard. Simon also raised concerns during that
  consultation about cookies given to him by his daughter that were prepared by
  Patterson, Ford said. Simon told him Patterson called multiple times to ask if
  he’d eaten the cookies, and he wondered if antifreeze had been used in them to
  poison him. Ford told the court that Simon told him he kept a sample to test,
  but Ford said he could not recall finding out if the sample had been tested.
  Ford also said Simon advised him during the consultation that, given his
  conclusions about Patterson, he wished to change his advanced care directives.
  He changed these directives so that his father, Don Patterson, not his
  estranged wife, was listed as his medical power of attorney, Ford said. Soon
  after this, Ford told the court, he had a “coded conversation” with Don at
  church, in which he believed the pair understood each other regarding the
  change Simon had made. Ford said in his pre-trial evidence that shortly after
  this same service he was standing in church with Simon when Patterson
  approached, confirmed an appointment time with Ford for the Pattersons’
  daughter, and then turned to Simon and invited him to lunch. Ford said that
  after Patterson left, Simon said to him “he will politely decline her invite”.
  During the trial, the court heard that Simon cancelled the night before the
  lunch, upsetting Patterson. Don Patterson’s jar of vomit On 30 July 2023, the
  morning after the lunch, Ford said that Simon called him to tell him that
  Patterson’s guests had fallen ill. Ford told the court he then contacted a
  doctor who was treating some of the guests, Dr Chris Webster, and told him he
  suspected they may have been deliberately poisoned. He said he then visited
  the hospital to tell a second doctor, and saw Don and Gail Patterson there. He
  said he spoke to Don, who had a jar of vomit with him. Ford, who did not give
  evidence during the trial, told the pre-trial hearing that he thought Don was
  holding on to it because it could be evidence, but said Don did not say those
  exact words. Ford said he believed this was what was implied because of his
  previous conversations with Don about suspected poisoning. “As best as I can
  remember, he held the jar of vomit up and said, ‘I’ve got this sample, what do
  you think I should do with it, Chris?’ I then replied saying ‘Hold on to it
  because it could be useful later’, or along those lines. “There was implied
  meaning in there but nothing more explicitly.” Broader family ‘made aware of
  Simon’s suspicions’ The pre-trial hearings heard evidence that Simon discussed
  his suspicions with some family members before the lunch, but told the broader
  family, including the Wilkinsons’ children, during a meeting at the chapel of
  the Austin hospital on 2 August 2023. Ruth Dubois, the Wilkinsons’ daughter,
  said in evidence before a pre-trial hearing on 21 August 2024 that this was
  when she was “made aware of Simon’s suspicions”. “Simon came to us one night
  and wanted to have a chat with us and our family,” Dubois said. “He wanted to
  tell us that he suspected his … illnesses had been a deliberate act, that he
  had stopped eating food than Erin had prepared. “He suspected Erin had been
  messing with it, he was really sorry that he hadn’t told our family before
  this … but he thought he was the only person she was targeting, and that we
  would be safe.” She said some of her siblings, including David Wilkinson, who
  had walked Patterson down the aisle at her wedding, and Simon’s siblings, were
  at the meeting. She told the court that the next day, Simon emailed his
  siblings and cousins about the chapel meeting, attaching his medical records.
  Dubois said she did not think she had discussed his allegations with him
  since. Her mother, Heather Wilkinson, and Gail died the next day, and Don on 5
  August. According to evidence heard in the s198b hearings in October 2024,
  Simon also told Sally Ann Atkinson, the department of health official
  investigating the poisoning, that he believed Patterson may have previously
  tried to poison him on multiple occasions, and also told child protection
  workers about his suspicions. In the same March 2025 ruling in which Beale
  declared that the lunch charges and Simon charges should be severed, he
  excluded other records taken from computers seized from Patterson’s home
  “regarding access or possible access to information on poisons”. In the
  ruling, Beale also declared that a post Patterson put on a Facebook page
  called “Poisons Help; Emergency Identification For Mushrooms &amp; Plants” was
  inadmissible. The reasons for this ruling and prosecution and defence
  submissions about the admissibility of evidence have not been released to the
  media. During her trial, but without the jury present, the post was raised
  amid legal argument about whether to re-admit tendency evidence regarding
  Patterson, following an application by her lawyers. It was not disputed that
  Patterson made the post, but it was ultimately not admitted into evidence. The
  court heard that Patterson posted on this Facebook page that her cat had just
  eaten a mushroom that was growing in grass under a tree. “He’s having a
  vomit,” Patterson wrote in the post under the profile name Erin Erin. “The
  accused has never owned a cat,” prosecutor Jane Warren told the court. ‘You’re
  paid by Erin, I believe she’s trying to harm me’ Other evidence raised in
  pre-trial hearings that was not heard during the trial included that Simon
  considered writing a book or taking part in an interview with a major
  television network and was paying a public relations expert. But he denied
  that financial reward was the only reason he was considering these options. “I
  think there would be quite a few [reasons] why that would be a good idea,”
  Simon said, while being cross-examined by Mandy, for Patterson, during a
  hearing in October 2024. “The local community is grieving because of what
  happened and a lot of people are keen to know what happened. I think informing
  them of what happened would help with their grief. “Another reason is that
  it’s possible that you’re here to damage my reputation. You’re paid by Erin, I
  believe she’s trying to harm me, and you’re her mouthpiece. “And that will
  shape the media narrative, that potentially creates a risk to me that I need
  to mitigate after the trial is over.” “For considerable financial reward?”
  Mandy asked. “Potentially yes,” Simon responded. Other evidence from the
  pre-trial hearings included testimony from the so-called Facebook friends, who
  met Patterson through the Keep Keli Lane Behind Bars group. One of the
  friends, Daniela Barkley, who said she was working on a book about the case
  called What Tore Us Apart, said she also had a “vivid” recollection of
  Patterson being upset that Simon bought her a shovel for her birthday in 2022.
