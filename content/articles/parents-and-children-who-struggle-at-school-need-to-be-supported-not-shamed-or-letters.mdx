  As a single parent of a child with suspected autistic traits, I find Bridget
  Phillipson’s comments deeply unfair (Bridget Phillipson: parents must do more
  about bad behaviour and attendance in schools, 31 August). Each morning can
  take me up to two hours just to get my daughter into school. Despite all my
  efforts, she is often absent due to severe anxiety. I am on my knees with
  exhaustion. The struggle makes it almost impossible to plan working days or
  earn a stable income, and I receive no benefits. For more than two years I
  have tried to access child and adolescent mental health services support. We
  have only recently been accepted on to the neurodiversity pathway, yet face a
  further nine-month wait for assessment. In the meantime, there is no
  meaningful help. Our school does what it can, but cuts to children’s services
  mean families like mine are left to cope alone. Parents are already doing
  everything possible. What we need is a government that acknowledges these
  realities and invests in proper special educational needs and disabilities and
  mental health support, not one that simply tells us to “do more”. Katherine
  Green London • Jeremy Hunt’s dismissal of vital support for disabled children
  as a “cash transfer” stings for parents, like me, who have disabled children
  (Overdiagnosis of children overlooks that growing up is ‘messy and uneven’,
  says Jeremy Hunt, 27 August). While other kids learn, play and have fun at
  their schools and nurseries, my deafblind son Harvey breaks down. We couldn’t
  get the funding for a nursery place that best meets his needs, so now he
  doesn’t eat, and gets so distressed he pulls out his cochlear implants.
  Battling the system to find an appropriate nursery feels lonely and isolating,
  but in many ways it’s worse to know I am far from alone. Research from Sense,
  the national disability charity, shows almost half of parents with disabled
  children have struggled to find a school that meets their child’s needs,
  meaning there are thousands of children across the country missing out on the
  support and education they need to get the best start in life. This isn’t
  about overdiagnosis or children not having enough “resilience” – it’s about
  cuts to public services that leave children like my son paying the price. This
  will have lifelong consequences. Behind all this talk are real families like
  mine, desperate for more investment in this failing system, so children like
  Harvey can get the support they need. Kimberly Hind Clitheroe, Lancashire •
  Statements about overdiagnosis of mental health problems do not allow for
  different thresholds of distress. Some people can ride out symptoms, while
  others experience acute difficulty and despair. The shift in awareness and
  recognition of conditions, often perpetuated by social media, has helped to
  make certain labels fashionable and, along with the impact of some campaigns,
  there will be individuals who self-diagnose. But there is ample evidence that
  there has been a worrying escalation in the number of young people, especially
  girls, with anxiety and depression, and a rise in hospital admissions for
  eating disorders, self-harm and attempted suicide. It does not make economic
  let alone humane sense to underestimate too readily those who may be
  struggling in silence but need urgent help, as two-thirds of later and
  lifelong mental illness starts in adolescence. Marjorie Wallace Chief
  executive, Sane • Sally Weale’s article reflecting on overdiagnosis of mental
  health conditions in young people will touch many raw nerves, particularly in
  parents with teenagers. The debate as framed puts these parents between a rock
  and a hard place. While we want the best possible support for our children, we
  don’t want them to be labelled without good cause. Framing the debate around
  diagnosis rates creates an illusionary binary model of health: either you are
  well, or you are not; either you have an anxiety disorder, or you don’t. The
  reality, however, is very different. We all sit on a continuum of cognitive
  and emotional wellbeing: we all have good days and bad days. However, crises
  apart, there is greater value in improving the wellbeing of everyone,
  especially for those at most risk. Surprisingly, improving the wellbeing of
  the population as a whole also helps the most vulnerable. It reduces their
  vulnerability and in so doing reduces the number who need professional
  support. This not only reduces health service burden but increases
  accessibility for those at most risk. An unlooked-for benefit of the mental
  health crisis in young people might be a national conversation on the kind of
  society we want, and how this can be achieved to the benefit of everyone. Prof
