  Chantal Maher, a physiotherapy lecturer in Sydney, has a niggling life admin
  task on her mental to-do list. It has been on her mind for four years. “I’ve
  tried to do it twice, but because I got married and changed my name I had to
  do a change-of-name certificate. That delayed it further. It was like a whole
  other hurdle,” she says. The task is combining her two superannuation
  (pension) accounts, so that she only pays one admin fee. “It’s too annoying.
  There’s incentive as I’d save money, but finding time for it is another
  thing.” Mia Northrop, co-author of Life Admin Hacks, has encountered countless
  situations like this. She says people can get “stuck” in different stages of
  completing a task. “You might be really good at starting and really bad at
  finishing,” she says, or vice versa. “So you need to know this about yourself
  so that you can overcome the challenge.” When people struggle with admin, such
  as tax returns or creating a will, it can stem from fear of failure, Northrop
  says. “It’s tedious. It’s repetitive. It is often asking us to work on things
  that we are not particularly good at or confident about. That’s where a lot of
  procrastination can come into it because we aren’t particularly proficient, or
  we’re not passionate about it.” “Everyone procrastinates to some extent,” says
  clinical psychologist Dr Catherine Houlihan, from the University of the
  Sunshine Coast. “There’s a bit of stigma around it, because many people say
  it’s laziness or poor time management, and none of those things are true. It
  is actually a symptom of perfectionism. “When people have very high standards
  for themselves, and they worry about doing things perfectly … then, due to the
  standard not being met, guilt and shame and self-detrimental talk can come
  in.” Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the
  weekend, every Saturday morning There’s another reason Maher has put off her
  task – it seems harder than it needs to be. “I feel frustrated because I think
  [the companies] could make my life easier,” she says. “Part of me wonders if
  they make it deliberately awkward so we don’t do it.” Certain life admin tasks
  are irritating because you may only encounter them once. Associate Prof Micah
  Goldwater, a cognitive scientist at the University of Sydney, says we have to
  invest a lot of mental effort in learning new tasks. Then when we’re done, it
  “feels like there is very little use for it”. “With online forms there’s an
  initial block because … you’re having to learn how to use the specific form,”
  he says. “The functionality of all these forms is slightly different, and you
  have to be very detail-oriented and focused to work it out. Sometimes it seems
  like the trade-off isn’t worth it.” So what can a life-admin avoider do to
  tick off tedious tasks? Break it down into easier steps Northrop says she
  can’t get passionate about doing her tax return, so she created a checklist
  for herself – she ticks off sub-tasks throughout the year. “I have a folder
  where I save everything as I go so that when it comes to tax time, it’s not
  overwhelming.” Bribe yourself Houlihan suggests incorporating rewards as you
  complete each stage. “Do one thing first and then pause and do something more
  enjoyable, have a break and go back to it,” she says. When Houlihan tackles an
  unpleasant task, she will break for “a pastry at a cafe, spending time in
  nature or watching the TV show I wanted to watch … a reward can help motivate
  us”. Find a buddy Telling other people what you plan to do can be helpful,
  says Northrop, but Houlihan says it can be controversial too. “You don’t want
  people to nag you,” Houlihan says. “That might give the tasks even more
  negative connotations” – which reinforces procrastination. “But if you say to
  someone that loves and cares about you ‘I want to do this by Friday’, it can
  help you hold yourself accountable.” The worse you feel about your ability to
  do a task, the less likely you’ll be to attempt it, and then the worse you’ll
  feel for not doing it. So choose your people wisely: “Not someone who is going
  to be on your back, or going to make you feel bad if you don’t do it.” Block
  out time “If there’s a task I have to do, rather than being on a vague to-do
  list, I put it into my calendar,” Goldwater says. Blocking off time in your
  day means it’s more likely to happen, he says. “Everything is in my calendar
  now. If it’s not on the calendar, I will most likely forget about it. Life
  admin tasks are one of those things.” Host a ‘forcing party’ Combining
  accountability buddies with blocking out time, writer and educator Tyler
  Alterman found a novel way to beat procrastination. On X, he posted that
  throwing a “forcing party”, where he and his friends got together to do life
  admin they’d been avoiding, was a huge success. “A passport has been filed
  for, an inbox has been zero’d, a personal website has been created, &amp;
  more,” he wrote. Create a calm space If your environment is working against
  you, it might help to remove some of that friction, Northrop says. “Shut down
  distractions, turn off notifications, or listen to music that gets you in that
  flow state.” If you’re neurodivergent, “it’s extra challenging”, she adds.
  “There’s no silver bullet. It’s often a mixture of the physical environment
  and our own personality … I’ve had clients who have multiple children or
  health issues they’re having to accommodate, and there are only so many hours
  in the day.” Do the worst part first “If boring tasks sit at the end of your
  day or the end of your week, they’re probably looming in the back of your
  mind,” Houlihan says. “The anticipation of how unpleasant it will be grows and
  grows. “One quick tip is to flip your calendar upside down – start with the
  most boring things first and to get them out of the way.” Call in an expert
  Some life admin is incredibly convoluted and taxing. At this point, it’s worth
  considering engaging someone to help you navigate it, such as a social worker
  or solicitor. Ines Jusufspahic is an immigration lawyer in Sydney who works
  with individuals and companies to complete working visas and partner visas.
  “We take the angst out of it as much as possible,” the principal solicitor at
  Rocket &amp; Ash Immigration Law says. Jusufspahic has had clients return to
  Brazil, Argentina and the UK: they had avoided the paperwork for so long,
  there wasn’t enough time to process their visas. “This is often the biggest
  problem in their life, and there’s often a time pressure,” she says. “It’s a
  process that people really dislike, and it’s really confusing for some
  people.” Houlihan says some people are chronic procrastinators, and the first
  step is recognising any patterns in your behaviour. “If you’ve still got that
  piece of paper on your table, then is that the only thing that’s still lying
  around?” she says. If it’s a widespread issue, and causing negative thoughts,
  a therapist can help you identify and work through the possible emotional
  triggers and understand why. “That’s really the key to what to do about it.”
  Do it later “I think we are often just being too hard on ourselves,” Houlihan
  says. “We can become trapped in a cycle of heightened stimulation and being on
  the go, especially if you have young children, and we can have this sense of
  urgency that we just apply to all tasks. “Actually take stock and think ‘Do I
  need to do this now?’” Houlihan has put off renewing her passport, as it’s not
  due for months. So she simply took it off her to-do list for now. “Because I
  could just do with one less thing at the moment.” Opting to take time for
  yourself instead can be an act of self-care, she says. Maher agrees: “If my
  choice is to go for a run, read a book, see a friend or do life admin, I’m
  gonna choose the other three things every single day of the week.”
