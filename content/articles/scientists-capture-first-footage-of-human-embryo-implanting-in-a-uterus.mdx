  A human embryo being implanted into a uterus has been pictured in real time
  and in 3D footage for the first time by a team of scientists. It shows images
  of an embryo implanting into a synthetic uterus, demonstrating how the process
  occurs naturally. The groundbreaking footage was released by researchers at
  the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in collaboration with
  Dexeus University hospital in Barcelona, which donated the embryos. Samuel
  Ojosnegros, the principal investigator of the IBEC’s bioengineering for
  reproductive health group and lead author of the study, said the work was
  significant because it revealed how the implementation process happened in
  detail. “We have observed that human embryos burrow into the uterus, exerting
  considerable force during the process,” Ojosnegros said. “These forces are
  necessary because the embryos must be able to invade the uterine tissue,
  becoming completely integrated with it. It is a surprisingly invasive process.
  Although it is known that many women experience abdominal pain and slight
  bleeding during implantation, the process itself had never been observed
  before.” Embryo implantation occurs when a fertilised egg attaches to the
  lining of the uterus about six to 12 days after ovulation. A platform that
  allows embryos to implant outside the uterus under controlled conditions was
  developed by the researchers. This platform, based on a gel made partly by
  collagen and uterine tissue, then enabled real-time fluorescence imaging and
  analysis of the embryo’s interactions with its environment. After this,
  researchers carried out experiments with human and mouse embryos to compare
  the two implantation processes. They discovered that while a mouse embryo
  sticks to its surface, a human embryo penetrates the uterine tissue completely
  before growing from the inside out. The study also showed that during the
  implantation process, the human embryo released enzymes that broke down the
  surrounding tissue, and that this embryo also exerted traction forces on its
  environment. The failure of the implantation process is one of the main causes
  of infertility, accounting for about 60% of miscarriages. According to the
  researchers, this study, which helps to improve understanding of the
  implantation process, could have a significant impact on fertility rates.
  Amélie Godeau, a researcher and co-first author of the study, said: “We
  observe that the embryo pulls on the uterine matrix, moving and reorganising
  it. It also reacts to external force cues. We hypothesise that contractions
  occurring in vivo may influence embryo implantation.”
