  don’t get more varied or vital

  Near End of the Road’s second stage is a billboard with an “extremely
  sophisticated, algorithmic” flow chart asking very specific questions to
  determine which artist you should see this weekend. Since I dislike snakes but
  like rodents, it offers me Danish musician Astrid Sonne, who has sadly had to
  cancel ahead of the weekend. Nonetheless, the Top Tipper, by artists Mikesian
  Studio, is characteristic of the Wiltshire festival: playful, charming, with
  curation by an obviously human rather than algorithmic hand. The 13,500 people
  at this year’s EOTR are generous and enthusiastic listeners. Texan guitarist
  Hayden Pedigo seems bowled over by how many people turn up to watch him open
  the glade-like Garden stage on Friday lunchtime. He only started playing live
  a couple of years ago and professes to have terrible stage fright – though you
  wouldn’t know in the least from his delightful stage presence, telling us
  about how his Amarillo home is so flat that locals joke about being able to
  see your dog run away for three days. His widescreen, open-tuned instrumentals
  contain multitudes: proggy drama, nimble scurrying, Earth-like doom country
  and plenty of space. Cornish folk singer Daisy Rickman is a great complement,
  evoking craggier vistas from closer to home in her weighty, self-possessed
  songs, backed by a full band. A cover of the Velvet Underground’s All
  Tomorrow’s Parties makes a virtue of her stunningly deep voice and brings out
  the drone folk DNA in the original. For the last couple of songs, she hops on
  drums and sings, closing on a couple of numbers that almost have a Balearic
  heat in the sax. Her solo records are great, but she needs to make a full band
  record to capture their intuitive magic. On the low-roofed Boat stage later
  on, Mandy, Indiana make bucolic rambles a distant memory with their dystopian
  industrial racket, fuelled by grinding guitar and whippet-nimble drums, and
  Caribou closes the main stage with the sort of lethally efficient good vibes
  that you suspect Dan Snaith can parlay with his eyes closed. By Saturday, it
  becomes apparent that Friday was the last time the festivalgoers would ever
  know peace, ie remain dry. The New Eves cut through the torpor with their
  Raincoats and Velvets-influenced battle cries, while Lily Seabird leaves a
  quieter, deeper impression to a packed tent of people who discover magic while
  dodging the rain. The Vermont songwriter has some of Big Thief to her brawny,
  easy rockers, coupled with a gorgeously open-hearted voice that recalls
  Lucinda Williams and Frances Quinlan of Hop Along. She plays one new song
  solo: a stunning, rangy reverie that suggests an indie star in the making. But
  if EOTR has a true breakout talent, it’s Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti. On
  Saturday, Titanic, her duo with romantic partner and guitarist Hector Tosta,
  rework their new album – which isn’t even out for a week. That drive to
  reinvent speaks to a profound shared musical language, clear from the way the
  band visually communicate almost to the point of egging each other on to push
  things further. Just the opening bars of tectonic interplay between Fratti,
  Tosta, drummer Friso van Wijck and saxophonist Nat Philipps is stunning; Van
  Wijck can shift from blastbeats to chattering woodblocks in seconds; they
  evoke the squall of a charged city on the brink of collapse. Fratti’s melodies
  are so pristine they could be produced as traditional chanson, but Titanic
  never do anything so predictable: at one point, the best comparison for what
  they’re doing is Maria Callas were she produced by Sunn O))), operatic
  desolation backed up by cliff faces of noise. Fratti’s voice is usually the
  piercingly calm centre of the music, but by the last song she’s starting to
  come apart vocally, and the raggedness of her singing is a thrill. Titanic is
  her maximalist side; her solo performance on Sunday with Tosta and Gibrán
  Andrade on drums is more minimalist and plaintive, making a virtue of space,
  always keeping you guessing and only breaking their immaculate tension with a
  sludge metal cataclysm right at the end. No one is doing it like these Mexico
  City musicians, though Moin are almost as exciting, an exercise in controlled
  collapse – with shades of Slint’s doominess – as drummer Valentina Magaletti
  creates a striking sense of space in her playing. And certainly the only
  artist who could bring the sunshine – figuratively, at least – is Sofia
  Kourtesis, whose wistful, songwriterly house feels particularly heartfelt
  today, as does her shoutout to mentor Caribou, who comes on and gives her a
  huge hug. (Later, during his secret set as Daphni on the Boat stage, he plays
  their collaboration Unidos amid a set of heaters that thrive on being played
  under a low tarpaulin roof, unlike his big-tent hits.) That sort of warmth is
  missing from Self Esteem’s headline set, which feels too choreographed and
  stern to charm this festival crowd, not to mention bum-clenchingly basic in
  its Handmaid’s Tale-evoking vision of feminism. It feels like nature healing
  itself to leave to see Viagra Boys, a group of men literally singing a song
  called Sports, as is right and proper. The Swedish punks are not quite as
  riotous as expected – there’s almost a shocking maturity to their sax-dappled
  sound – but we later learn that they’ve donated their entire fee to Doctors
  Without Borders, one of several shows of support for Palestine at the
  festival. They loosen the night up again, as does Syrian dabke producer Rizan
  Said, whose set is relentless fun. No such thing can be said for the weather
  on Sunday. At lunchtime, a small girl is wailing to her parents that she just
  can’t walk any more, a tearful refusal that I think many here five times her
  age would also like to scream at the filthy sky. But walk on we do: to Jake
  Xerxes Fussell’s plucky folk rambles, which bounce along with the verve of
  Richard Scarry characters; Ryan Davis and the Roadhouse Band’s amiable
  picaresque Americana; folk group Shovel Dance Collective, whose hungry remit
  quests from casting celestial spells to traditional fiddle-de-de. Blawan
  offers bracing blasts of bathhouse techno, laced with fun, demonic vocal
  samples, screaming fizz and industrial lockstep, and Squid bring back memories
  of one-album wonders Clor with their funhouse take on post-punk. And to these
  jaded ears at least, EOTR works some of its magic in getting me to enjoy some
  of Father John Misty’s headline set, having never been a fan. The clever
  lounge lizard stuff is still a bit offputtingly pleased with itself, but
  Screamland is disarming in its unvarnished desperation, a cosmic epic that
  hits like Coldplay having an existential crisis. Josh Tillman’s set is
  loose-limbed, ludic and romantic, and his old troll energy seems well and
  truly consigned to the dustbin of history; he’s ardently sincere, telling
  EOTR’s faithful “they don’t make ’em like you”. He’s right: in its capacity to
  surprise and delight, it’s a special place.
