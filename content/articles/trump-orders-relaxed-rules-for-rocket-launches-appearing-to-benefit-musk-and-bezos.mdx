  Donald Trump is looking to relax environmental rules for commercial spaceship
  companies. In an executive order titled “Enabling Competition in the
  Commercial Space Industry” that he signed on Wednesday, he said it’s
  imperative to national security that the private rocket-ship industry increase
  launches “substantially” by 2030. That would mean, according to the executive
  order, that those companies may be able to forgo the environmental reviews
  that are required under the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). Private
  space companies are required to obtain launch permits from the Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA). And, as part of that process, companies are
  subject to review under Nepa. Sean Duffy, the US secretary of transportation,
  which oversees the FAA, called Trump’s executive order “visionary”. The FAA
  has faced criticism from space companies for taking too long to review launch
  permits while environmental groups have lambasted the agency for not using
  Nepa reviews to require more protections at launch sites. These environmental
  reviews are required because rocket launches and landings can be massively
  disruptive to local towns and residents, along with the natural surroundings.
  Exhaust, smoke plumes and sonic booms created at launch can injure and kill
  endangered species, and detritus from exploded rocket parts returning to Earth
  can harm fish and marine animals with hazardous material spills, fuel slicks
  and falling objects. Trump’s executive order appears to especially benefit
  Elon Musk and his company SpaceX. SpaceX has been seeking to increase its
  rocket launches and landings around the country. The company has been involved
  in a lawsuit brought by environmental groups for violating the National
  Environmental Policy Act; they say the FAA did not do a thorough enough
  environmental assessment of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species regarding
  its rocket launches in Boca Chica, Texas. The lawsuit looked at the first
  launch of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket in Texas in April 2023. The rocket,
  which is designed to one day make it to Mars, pulverized its launchpad on
  takeoff, sending chunks of concrete flying 6 miles (10km) away. The blast
  ignited a grassfire that burned nearly 4 acres (1.5 hectares) of state park
  and, from what is known, destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a
  collection of blue land crabs. “This reckless order puts people and wildlife
  at risk from private companies launching giant rockets that often explode and
  wreak devastation on surrounding areas,” said Jared Margolis, a senior
  attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that
  brought the lawsuit. “Bending the knee to powerful corporations by allowing
  federal agencies to ignore bedrock environmental laws is incredibly dangerous
  and puts all of us in harm’s way,” Margolis added. “This is clearly not in the
  public interest.” The FAA announced in May that it had given SpaceX permission
  to increase its number of Starship launches in Texas from five per year to 25.
  SpaceX has also been seeking to increase launches of its smaller Falcon
  rockets from Vandenberg space force base in California from 50 per year to 95.
  Trump’s executive order would facilitate an expedited review process to get
  these and other launch permits. Along with SpaceX, the order would benefit
  commercial space companies such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, which has also
  been aiming to increase the number of its rocket launches. The White House
  touted the order on Wednesday as being the latest “deregulatory action” to
  reform Nepa and eliminate “burdensome DEI requirements”. • This article was
  amended on 14 August 2025. Jeff Bezos’s space company is named Blue Origin,
  not Blue Horizon as an early version stated.
