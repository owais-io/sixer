  The City of London police are investigating claims by environmental activists
  to have carried out acts of sabotage on the offices of major insurers and
  financial institutions. Activist group Shut the System said its supporters had
  cut cables and glued electrical service cabinets at JP Morgan Chase and
  Allianz, in what it described as the start of “a period of sustained sabotage”
  against fossil fuel finance. The group also claimed to have targeted the
  Northampton HQ of Barclaycard, saying its activists had cut the 5G cable to
  the communications mast serving the building. Shut the System distributed
  photographs purporting to show its supporters carrying out the actions.
  Northampton police said they had not received any report of vandalism. Supt Jo
  Cash of the City of London police, said: “We are aware of a social media post
  by Shut the System, which alleges that criminal damage has been caused to
  infrastructure in the City of London. “We have had no reports of any criminal
  activity at this time, but we’re speaking to those companies mentioned in the
  post and the wider business community. Inquiries are ongoing.” Shut the System
  said it targeted JP Morgan because it was “ranked the world’s largest banking
  investor in fossil fuels”, while Barclays was targeted because it was Europe’s
  largest. Allianz was targeted, according to Shut the System, because it is the
  sixth biggest insurer of fossil fuel projects and also insures Elbit Systems,
  the Israeli arms company. A Shut the System spokesperson said: “I am enraged
  by the financial sector’s continued support for deadly industries. “‘Just
  doing our job’ wasn’t an excuse in world war 2 and it isn’t today. They have a
  choice of which industries they finance. I cannot bear to stand idly by while
  those in power continue to exacerbate global problems just so the wealthy few
  can make increased profits. “It is unhinged, psychopathic greed at the expense
  of billions of people.” The group says it is calling for financial
  institutions to stop all finance and insurance for fossil fuel expansion
  immediately; adopt 1.5C-aligned emissions-reduction targets for oil, gas, and
  coal; demand robust 1.5C-aligned transition plans for all existing fossil fuel
  clients; protect Indigenous peoples’ and human rights; and scale up financing
  for a just and fair transition. If the financial sector ignores their demands,
  then by October they will escalate further, the group said. JP Morgan and
  Barclays were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for Allianz said there was
  no disruption or impact on its business operations. Shut the System previously
  targeted insurance companies in the City in January, sabotaging fibre optic
  cables in an action that one cybersecurity expert said caused a “significant
  slowdown of internet speed” in the district. Its clandestine tactics are a
  departure from those of Extinction Rebellion and its successors Insulate
  Britain and Just Stop Oil, for whom accountability for their actions was a key
  part of their modus operandi. A number of supporters of Just Stop Oil have
  received lengthy sentences after a crackdown on environmental activism that
  has included a number of draconian new laws passed and stiffer sentences
  handed down to direct action protesters. Shut the System’s spokesperson said:
  “We have been forced underground by draconian anti-protest laws. The British
  state has recently shown how much they are willing to suppress peaceful
  protest. “History shows direct action and sabotage are highly effective so we
  cannot stop while the climate emergency wages on and we see the most hopeful
  path forward is to operate beyond the state’s reach.”
