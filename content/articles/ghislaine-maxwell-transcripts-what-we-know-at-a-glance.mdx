  The US Department of Justice has released the transcripts and audio recording
  of an interview conducted by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, with
  the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The transcripts include
  redacted documentation from a two-day interview on 24 and 25 July and several
  audio recordings. Here’s what we know so far at a glance: Maxwell said that
  she “never” saw Donald Trump receive a massage. She also said that she “never
  witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” adding that,
  whenever she saw the president, he was “a gentleman in all respects”. One
  notable point is that Maxwell denied ever recruiting masseuses from Trump’s
  Mar-a-Lago club. “I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as
  far as I remember. I can’t ever recollect doing that,” she told Blanche. A
  reminder that Trump claimed his falling-out with Epstein stemmed from
  Epstein’s efforts to hire workers away from Trump’s Florida club. Maxwell
  detailed the social relationship between Trump and Epstein, who cultivated a
  wide and powerful social circle for many years. “I don’t know how they met,
  and I don’t know how they became friends. I certainly saw them together and I
  remember the few times I observed them together, but they were friendly. I
  mean, they seemed friendly,” she said. She also told Blanche that she was not
  aware of any “client list” of Epstein’s. Maxwell also did not recall former US
  president Bill Clinton receiving a massage while travelling with Epstein.
  Blanche said, on the record, that the conversation was not “promising to do
  anything” for Maxwell. He said that anything she said could not be used
  against her, unless she provided false statements or there was a retrial in
  her case. According to Maxwell, Epstein did not have any video or photographic
  evidence of any high-profile individuals committing sexual offences. And to
  that point, Maxwell also said she didn’t hear or witness any instances of
  Epstein blackmailing powerful people. Maxwell said she recruited a number of
  masseuses for Epstein but “never checked their age or credentials”. She added
  that, throughout her time with Epstein, she never heard any examples of
  “sexually inappropriate contact” between Epstein’s guests and in-house
  masseuses. Despite her claims that Epstein did not extort anyone, Maxwell said
  she did not believe that Epstein died by suicide. She chalked that up to
  “mismanagement” at the Bureau of Prisons. In the interview, Maxwell said she
  did believe that Epstein “did a lot of, not all, but some of what he’s accused
  of”. But she maintained that “he became that man over a period of time”.
  Maxwell did not remember whether Trump submitted a letter for Epstein’s 50th
  birthday album, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. She also could not
  remember asking Trump to contribute. Maxwell said Hillary Clinton did not
  associate with Epstein. When Maxwell was asked if Epstein “knew or had any
  sort of visit, dealings or associated with Hillary Clinton,” Maxwell
  responded: “I would say no.”
