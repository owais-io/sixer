  Californians are bracing for the first major heatwave of the year, a multiday
  scorcher that could bring triple-digit temperatures, pose significant threats
  to public health and sharply heighten wildfire risks. After a notably cooler
  summer, temperatures are expected to spike across the American south-west
  starting on Wednesday and extending through the weekend, as severe conditions
  expand north along the coast into British Columbia by the end of the week. The
  extreme weather event will create a trio of compounding dangers, with a
  heightened chance of thunderstorms also predicted alongside the heat and fire
  risks. The National Weather Service has issued a swath of heat advisories,
  watches and warnings, along with red-flag alerts, warning the public to
  prepare. “This dangerous level of heat will pose a threat to anyone without
  effective cooling and adequate hydration,” NWS forecasters said in an outlook
  issued on Wednesday, outlining temperature highs that could climb past 110F
  (43C) in the desert south-west and above 100F across southern California.
  Temperatures could break local daily records in Los Angeles and across Arizona
  and Nevada. The heat will also linger after the sun sets, offering little
  reprieve overnight. “Widespread record warm overnight minimum temperatures”
  are possible through the west, according to climate scientist Daniel Swain,
  who shared an analysis of the upcoming event on his website. High night-time
  temperatures will add challenges to containing fires that erupt and increase
  the dangers for people unable to access cooling. “This heatwave may be most
  notable for sustained overnight warmth in some cases,” Swain said, “with
  minimum temperatures not dropping below 70-80F.” August is typically hot
  across this region. But for Californians who have not acclimated to high
  temperatures this year, the sharp shift could create health challenges. Those
  facing the greatest hazards will be outdoor workers, unhoused people and
  vulnerable populations, including children and seniors. Extreme heat, often
  called a “silent killer”, already ranks as the most lethal weather-related
  disaster in the US, and deaths are increasing. Fueled by the climate crisis,
  and often exacerbated by concrete cityscapes that cook when temperatures rise,
  heatwaves are getting longer, larger and more intense. Many areas that will be
  affected by this week’s heat event were also already primed to burn, including
  across areas of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. An extreme lack of moisture
  across southern California this year has left hillsides parched, overgrown and
  prone to ignite. But the heat could further cure vegetation, setting the stage
  for rapid fire growth and extreme behavior, according to the NWS. “California
  wildfire risk will likely reach its peak during this event between Thursday
  and Saturday,” Swain said. While these fires are not expected to be amplified
  by strong gusty winds, developing thunderstorms could add erratic breezy
  conditions and lightning could ignite new blazes. To prepare for the added
  threats, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has pre-deployed resources into
  high-risk areas, including 32 fire engines, nine water tenders, nine
  bulldozers, five helicopters, nine hand crews, 13 dispatchers and two incident
  management teams. It has already been a busy year of fire across the country,
  and more than 44,400 blazes have ignited, roughly 16% higher than the 10-year
  average. But there are still months to go before the highest risks typically
  subside, especially in California where strong Santa Ana winds blow through
  the autumn months.
