  It turns out the DNA of serial winners cannot be developed within three
  months. Tottenham should have been able to announce themselves kings of the
  continent here in Udine, flimsy though any grand statements after a Uefa Super
  Cup win might be. Thomas Frank had challenged them to back up the heroics of
  Bilbao with a statement in the Friulian heat and, by the evening’s end, he
  should have been basking in the kind of start that can define a new manager’s
  tenure. Instead he received a reminder that there is no quick fix to some
  deep-rooted habits. For long periods Spurs, faced with a lethargic Paris
  Saint-Germain, resembled a perfectly imprinted version of the Frank playbook.
  They pummelled their opponents in the air, their two-goal lead owing much to
  well-executed free-kicks and plenty more havoc arising besides. On top of that
  they looked at ease with a three-man back line that gave a stellar attack
  little encouragement. With five minutes of regulation time left there was no
  sign they would be subjected to penalty-inflicted torment. Then the PSG
  substitute Lee Kang‑in rifled past Guglielmo Vicario from 20 yards and, for
  the first time, the Champions League holders looked clear-eyed. By contrast
  Tottenham had sunk back and there was a familiar yawning dread when, simply
  unable to find a way out by now, they saw six added minutes held up on the
  touchline. In the fourth of them Gonçalo Ramos glanced in a cross from the
  otherwise quiet Ousmane Dembélé and Frank will be aware of the surgery still
  needed on a squad whose backbone is too accustomed to splintering. Not that
  anyone could judge too harshly. There will certainly be no recriminations for
  Micky van de Ven or Mathys Tel, who both erred in the shootout and rendered a
  Vitinha miss irrelevant. Van de Ven was denied by the highly scrutinised PSG
  debutant Lucas Chevalier, who had a mixed night, and Tel wafted his spot kick
  wide. It left Nuno Mendes to score the clincher and leave a resounding message
  that the best in class are never really down and out. Used correctly it is a
  lesson that will serve Spurs and Frank admirably. They looked well ahead of
  schedule for the majority, even allowing for the fact PSG appeared addled by a
  calendar that leaves them neither rested nor match sharp. Frank wants to add
  at least one big ticket signing to their attack but will have been enthused by
  the ball carrying of Mohammed Kudus, who was both tireless and effective, and
  some of the Ghanaian’s combinations with Richarlison. When Tottenham expressed
  themselves it was because, full of running, they had earned the right. But it
  was their booming, dominant presence from crosses that caused the most unrest.
  In the warm-up Frank’s players had lined up en masse to practise attacking set
  pieces, an unusual sight in time usually given to rondos and shooting drills.
  It foreshadowed what would follow. Kevin Danso’s long throw was utilised from
  the opening minutes and, the first time Spurs won a free-kick on halfway,
  Vicario was called to launch it boxwards. On the second occasion, they scored.
  Vicario unloaded another of those long, deep deliveries and Cristian Romero
  connected beyond the far post. The ball ricocheted and, after Chevalier
  brilliantly touched João Palhinha’s strike onto the bar, Van de Ven followed
  up. Frank referred afterwards to a “special operation” from such routines and,
  at that point, Spurs were delivering on their mission. Three minutes into the
  second half a deep Pedro Porro free-kick found Romero, announced before
  kick-off as the new captain, peeling around the back to plant a downwards
  header across Chevalier. In truth the keeper should have saved, applying a
  painfully weak hand to Romero’s attempt. PSG’s buildup had been dominated by
  Luis Enrique’s jettisoning of Gianluigi Donnarumma and any live feed from the
  Italian’s sofa would presumably have made compulsive viewing. Danso could have
  added a third. PSG, laboured and irritable, were resorting to the kind of
  desperate foul Willian Pacho committed on Pape Matar Sarr after gifting him a
  route towards goal. Spurs’ fans could sense a party in sleepy Udine but
  instead were dealt a lesson in the risks that come with dining among the
  elite.
