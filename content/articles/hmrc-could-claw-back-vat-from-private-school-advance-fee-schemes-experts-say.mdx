  Money saved using schemes to avoid paying VAT on private school fees could be
  clawed back by the government, tax experts have said, after it was revealed
  that the schemes had raised more than £500m. Analysis by the Daily Telegraph
  found that the UK’s wealthiest private schools took in £500m last year through
  “fee in advance” schemes. Parents who paid before the official announcement
  that VAT would be added to school fees hoped to avoid paying the extra 20%
  applied from January this year. But tax experts who spoke to the Guardian said
  HMRC would scrutinise the schemes to check whether they included specific
  details such as set prices, without which parents could be vulnerable to VAT
  being demanded in years to come. It could result in some of England’s most
  well-known schools, such as Winchester and Eton, locked in legal battles with
  the government. Dan Neidle, a tax lawyer and the founder of Tax Policy
  Associates, said many schools used fee in advance schemes like a deposit,
  meaning parents deposited a lump sum with the school, which then deducted each
  year’s fees. “We reckoned [there’s] a high chance that didn’t work from a VAT
  perspective, because VAT then applies at the point each year’s fees are
  invoiced. The question is whether HMRC will be challenging these,” Neidle
  said. The impact on VAT revenue was likely to be short-term, he added, with
  most parents paying only a year in advance. Even if the full £500m in
  pre-payments was allowed, it would represent only 5-6% in lost revenue for one
  year. A government spokesperson said: “The Office for Budget Responsibility
  has already factored in the increased use of pre-payment schemes in its
  revenue forecasts. Removing tax breaks for private schools is expected to
  raise £1.8bn a year by 2029-30. “This funding will help us recruit 6,500 new
  teachers and improve standards in state schools, which educate 94% of
  children.” The government said it could not comment on individual schools but
  confirmed that the fee in advance schemes could be liable to VAT based on how
  they operated. The key is how each scheme’s “tax point” – billing for each
  term’s fees – is defined. Government sources said that if the schemes failed
  to give details of what the money was buying at the time it was paid, then VAT
  was likely to be due. Many private schools began prompting parents to use the
  schemes when it was clear Labour would win the 2024 election and it had
  pledged in its manifesto to introduce VAT on school fees. In the past, the
  schemes were a way of parents receiving a discount for fees paid upfront or as
  part of divorce settlements. But the levying of VAT created a one-off
  opportunity for parents to avoid the tax. Tax lawyers said that any
  pre-payments made after 29 July 2024 – the date of the Treasury’s formal
  announcement adding VAT – were unlikely to avoid HMRC’s attention. HMRC has no
  deadline to begin an investigation, although it usually takes between one and
  four years to do so, meaning that parents and schools could face a lengthy
  period of legal jeopardy. The accounts for Brighton College show that it
  received £50m in fees in advance last year, compared with annual fee income of
  £60m. Eton received nearly £53m in advanced fees. Both schools charge about
  £63,000 a year for boarding school pupils, including VAT.
