  Morecambe’s prospective buyers have implored the owner of the crisis-hit club
  to sell up and announced that all first-team football operations have stopped
  there. Morecambe were suspended from the National League on Monday after a
  deadline passed for Jason Whittingham of Bond Group Investments to outline how
  the club would meet its financial obligations for the 2025-26 season.
  Whittingham had claimed in a statement released the previous day to be working
  “with the consortium led by Jonny Cato” on a deal to acquire the majority
  shareholding in Morecambe. He also claimed Bond Group had been unable to
  contact Panjab Warriors, the London-based investment company who received
  clearance from the EFL to purchase Morecambe in June. Panjab Warriors have
  since declared they are willing to proceed with a takeover with immediate
  effect. But in a further demonstration of the mounting crisis at Morecambe,
  who were relegated from the Football League after 18 years last season, it was
  revealed on Wednesday that all first-team operations have come to a halt. A
  joint statement issued by Panjab Warriors, the Shrimps Trust, minority
  shareholders and the Morecambe and Lunesdale MP, Lizzi Collinge, said: “As
  each day passes, the debts of the club are mounting, with wages now
  outstanding at over £316,000, and further significant debts that need to be
  paid to ensure survival of the club, which Panjab Warriors have already
  committed to pay within hours of completion with Bond Group. “In further
  developments today, the first team have had to stop all football operations as
  the required insurance which was in place has now lapsed as payment has not
  been made. As a result of this escalating situation, more first-team players
  have left the club with further players set to leave by the end of this week.”
  The statement added: “We implore Bond Group to complete the sale of the club
  immediately so that this anguish can be ended and the club can look to a
  brighter future under Panjab Warriors.”
