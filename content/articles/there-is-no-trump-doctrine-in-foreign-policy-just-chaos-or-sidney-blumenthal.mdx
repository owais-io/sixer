  All the elaborate efforts of the European allies to prevent Donald Trump from
  prostrating himself before Vladimir Putin came to naught at their summit
  meeting in Alaska. Flattering, coddling and petting the big baby appeared to
  have been in vain. Before the 15 August summit, the Europeans persuaded Trump
  to impose new sanctions if Putin would not agree to a ceasefire, which would
  serve as a prerequisite for any negotiations. But Trump willfully tossed
  policy like a stuffed animal out of the window of “the Beast,” the
  presidential car as he eagerly invited Putin to join him for a triumphant
  chariot ride. The Europeans scrambled once again, trying to get the addled
  Trump back on the page he was on before the summit. Ukraine’s president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sped to Washington to confer with Trump to try to pick up
  the pieces. At their last encounter, Trump jibed: “You don’t have any cards.”
  But Trump had just handed over his cards to Putin. Zelenskyy was not about to
  play the appeasement card. The European leaders gathered in an extraordinary
  posse to accompany Zelenskyy in an attempt to restore a unified western
  position. Unlike the last Zelenskyy meeting with Trump, he was not hectored.
  With the Ukrainian leader surrounded by a protective phalanx, Trump made
  agreeable sounding but vague gestures about a future summit with both
  Zelenskyy and Putin. Trump seemed favorable, if indefinite and imprecise,
  about western forces stationed in Ukraine to maintain its sovereignty. But the
  notion of a ceasefire, pressed again by the French president, Emmanuel Macron,
  and German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, had evaporated. While the European
  recovery effort took place at the White House, Russian bombs rained down.
  Trump dreams of receiving the Nobel peace prize. Before the summit, he called
  the Norwegian finance minister to lobby him. In Alaska, Trump melted again in
  the presence of Putin while the whole world was watching. The self-abasing
  embarrassment of his previous meeting in Helsinki in 2018 did not serve as a
  cautionary precedent. Now, he invited the sanctioned war criminal to US soil.
  He ordered uniformed US soldiers to roll out the red carpet, “the beautiful
  red carpet” as the Russian foreign ministry called it. He applauded when Putin
  stood next to him. He patted Putin’s hand when he clasped it with an
  affectionate gesture. Then the door of “the Beast” opened for Putin. Trump’s
  personal negotiator for the summit, Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate
  operator whose knowledge of Russian culture to prepare him for his delicate
  role may had been a bowl of borscht at the Russian Tea Room on 57th Street,
  was easy prey for Putin. Bild, the German newspaper, reported on 9 August that
  Witkoff had committed an “explosive blunder”. According to Bild, Putin “did
  not deviate from his maximum demand to completely control the five Ukrainian
  regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimea before the
  weapons remain silent … And even worse: Trump’s special envoy Witkoff is said
  to have completely misunderstood some of the Russians’ positions and
  misinterpreted them as an accommodation by Putin. He had misunderstood a
  “peaceful withdrawal” of the Ukrainians from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia demanded
  by Russia as an offer of “peaceful withdrawal” of the Russians from these
  regions”. “Witkoff doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” a Ukrainian
  government official told Bild. An assessment that, according to Bild
  information, is also shared by German government representatives. Bild further
  reported: “There was a telephone conference on Thursday evening between
  representatives of the US government – including the special envoy Witkoff and
  Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance – and the European
  partners. As BILD learned, the American side was perceived as chaotic and
  ununited. This was primarily due to Witkoff, whose remarks about his
  conversation with Putin on Wednesday in the Kremlin were perceived as
  confusing. He himself seemed overwhelmed and incompetent to the Europeans when
  he spoke about the territorial issues in Ukraine.” The German newspaper also
  reported friction between Rubio and Vance, with the vice-president seeking to
  shut the European allies out of the process and Witkoff taking his side
  against the secretary of state. “Apparently, there was also disagreement about
  the further course of action between Witkoff and Rubio, as the foreign
  minister emphasized that the Europeans should be involved in the further
  process, while Vance and Witkoff only wanted to inform Europe of the results
  of the further Trump steps.” Bild’s report on Putin’s position turned out to
  be completely accurate and its description of the Trump administration’s
  unsettled position prophetic of the fiasco that would unfold. Little noticed
  in the US media accounts, Trump had presented Putin with enormous economic
  advantages, according to the Telegraph. He offered access to valuable Alaskan
  natural resources, opportunities to tap into the US portion of the Bering
  Strait, which would boost Russia’s interests in the Arctic region. Trump
  promised to lift sanctions on Russia’s aircraft industry, which would permit
  Russian airlines (and by extension the Russian air force) to return to US
  suppliers for parts and maintenance. Trump would give Putin approval for
  access to rare earth minerals in Ukrainian territories currently under Russian
  occupation. In Trump’s new world order, Putin would be his partner, especially
  on the frontier of the Arctic, while Trump waged a trade war imposing harsh
  tariffs on every other nation. Ukraine stood as an obstacle to the gold rush.
  According to the Telegraph, Witkoff suggested to the Russians: “Israel’s
  occupation of the West Bank could be used as a model for ending the war.
  Russia would have military and economic control of occupied [parts of] Ukraine
  under its own governing body, similar to Israel’s de facto rule of Palestinian
  territory.” Then, after Trump laid on lavish treatment for the Russian
  dictator at the US military base, marking his indifference to international
  condemnation, came the joint appearance, which exceeded the Helsinki disaster.
  An elated Putin and dejected Trump appeared on stage together. The announced
  joint press conference was a theater of the absurd. Its brevity contributed to
  the farce. There was no agreement, no plan for an agreement, and no press
  conference. Trump deferred to Putin to speak first, to set the tone and terms
  after which he would come on as the second banana to slip on the peel. A
  clearly delighted Putin reiterated his belief that Ukraine was a security
  threat to Russia, and that “we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the
  primary causes of that conflict,” which was his language for the elimination
  of an independent and democratic Ukraine. He blamed Biden for the war he had
  launched. He affirmed Trump’s presumptuous boast that there would have been no
  war had he been president. “Today, when President Trump is saying that if he
  was the president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it
  would indeed be so. I can confirm that.” A clearly glum Trump stepped to his
  podium. “So there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said. He had pledged
  during the 2024 campaign that he could and would end the war on “day one”. It
  had taken him 210 days to reach the “No Deal”. Trump wistfully talked about
  doing business with Russia, his will-o’-the-wisp ambition since he attempted
  for decades to build a Trump Tower in Moscow even through the 2016 election.
  He threw Putin a bouquet. “I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with
  President Putin, with Vladimir.” He blamed their inability to monetize their
  relationship to the inquiries that extensively documented Putin’s covert
  efforts in the 2016 election to help Trump. “We were interfered with by the
  Russia, Russia, Russia hoax,” Trump complained. He would not let it go,
  drifting incoherently into his grievances. “He knew it was a hoax, and I knew
  it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for
  us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that
  would like to have dealt with, but we’ll have a good chance when this is
  over.” Then, Trump praised the Russian officials accompanying Putin. Chief
  among them was the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who had arrived wearing a
  sweatshirt embossed with the Cyrillic letters “CCCP”, standing for the Union
  of Soviet Socialist Republics, signaling Putin’s ultimate objective to restore
  the empire of the Soviet Union. The message was more than nostalgia; it was a
  mission statement. And Trump called Putin “the Boss”, not a reference to Bruce
  Springsteen. “Next time in Moscow,” said Putin. The press conference was over.
  There were no questions. There were no answers. Trump fled from the stage.
  Before the summit, Trump threatened new sanctions if Putin did not agree to a
  ceasefire, but now he forgot he had ever said that. He spoke loudly and
  carried a tiny stick. On Air Force One, on the return to Washington, he gave
  an exclusive interview to his lapdog, Sean Hannity of Fox News, along on the
  ride for this purpose. Trump reverted to his tacit support for Putin’s
  position. He put the burden on Zelenskyy to accede to Putin’s demands, which
  were unchanged. Then, Trump spiraled down a wormhole, obviously anxious about
  his growing unpopularity and the prospect of the Democrats winning the
  congressional midterm elections, which has prompted him to prod the Texas
  Republicans to gerrymander districts and California Democrats aroused to
  counter it in their state. “Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can’t have an
  honest election with mail-in voting,” said Trump. “Look at California with
  that horrible governor they have. One of the worst governors in history. He is
  incompetent, he doesn’t know what he is doing.” Is this a subject that Putin
  actually spoke about in their discussion? Has he had experience with mail-in
  voting or even know what it is? Was it brought up by Trump during their car
  ride? Or was Trump simply making it up for his gullible Fox News audience?
  Whatever the reality, Trump’s fear about losing control of domestic politics
  was at the top of his mind as he flew away from his charade in Anchorage. The
  shambolic scene left in Alaska represented the wreckage of Trump’s attempt at
  diplomacy. Setting the stage himself, Trump babbled, whined and weakly sided
  with Putin. Trump’s foreign policy team was exposed as incompetent, confounded
  and feckless. This was no best and the brightest, no rise of the Vulcans, but
  the circus of the Koalemosians, after Koalemos, the Greek god of stupidity.
  Apologists for Trump, in advance of this exemplary event, had suggested that
  there was such a conceit as a Trump doctrine. A former Trump official from his
  first term, A Wess Mitchell, has called it “The Return of Great Power
  Diplomacy” in the May/June issue of Foreign Affairs. He described “a new kind
  of diplomacy” that is “diplomacy in its classical form” and “an instrument of
  strategy”. He cited an ancient Spartan king, Archidamus II, the Roman Emperor
  Domitian, Cardinal Richelieu, and in his mélange did not neglect to throw in
  Metternich and Bismarck. (Kissinger, in his grave, must be weeping over the
  parading of Metternich’s mannequin as a forerunner of Trump. Mitchell, in any
  case, dismisses Kissinger as a fake realist and an “idealist”, which would
  have been a revelation to Kissinger.) Left out of Mitchell’s pantheon of great
  diplomatic influences through the ages is the influencer Laura Loomer, the
  loony far-right troll who has an open door to Trump, feeding him lists of
  national security officials he must purge. In Putin’s shadow, Trump was bared
  as having no larger or smaller concept or strategy of Great Power politics. It
  would be unfair to accuse Trump of having an idea beyond his
  self-aggrandizement. If anything, he aspires to be like Putin, whom he called
  a “genius” after his invasion of Ukraine. Putin has created and controls a
  vast kleptocracy. In 2017, Bill Browder, an American businessperson who had
  invested in Russia and has been targeted for assassination by Putin for
  exposing his corruption, testified before the Senate judiciary committee that
  Putin was “the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world”.
  Nobody, however, knows Putin’s true personal wealth. Trump, the Putin manqué,
  is trying to turn the United States into a kleptocratic system. According to
  the calculations of David D Kirkpatrick in the New Yorker, in just six months
  of his second term his alleged personal profiteering, “would disappoint the
  haters who saw Trump as a Putin-level kleptocrat. Yet some three and a half
  billion dollars in Presidential profits – even though my accounting is
  necessarily approximate – is a dizzying sum.” Meanwhile, three days before the
  Trump-Putin summit, the Trump family crypto business, World Liberty Financial,
  raised $1.5bn to buy the Trump family token. The CEO of World Liberty
  Financial, Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, along with Eric Trump of WLF,
  will join the board of the investing company. That is the Trump doctrine.
