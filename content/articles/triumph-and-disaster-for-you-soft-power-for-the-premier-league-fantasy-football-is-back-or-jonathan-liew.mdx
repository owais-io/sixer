  Perhaps you’re a template kind of guy. Perhaps, by contrast, you’re spurning
  the triple Liverpool consensus and stacking your team with handy differentials
  like Jarrod Bowen and Donyell Malen. Perhaps even Erling Haaland could be
  considered a differential given his historically low current ownership stats.
  Perhaps you’re feeling a cheeky BB GW1, followed by a FH GW2. Perhaps, by
  contrast, you’re furiously stabbing at the “close tab” button on your browser
  in the hope of purging these words from your eyes as expeditiously as
  possible. In which case, relax. This is actually a column about sport: what it
  is, what it isn’t, how we watch it, where it’s going. Most important, you can
  rest assured I shall not be relating any details of my Fantasy Premier League
  exploits, for the same reason I will not be sharing my dreams, my Wordle stats
  or the contents of my belly button. However fascinating you may find your own,
  it is genuinely no excuse for wasting anybody else’s time. At which point, we
  may just have lost the other half of the audience. Because there does seem to
  be a weird cultural divide over this stuff: a kind of snobbery/infantilism
  binary. So you get the increasingly prevalent view that obsessing over made-up
  teams in a made-up game is basically trite nonsense, the stuff of
  civilisational downfall, a parasite on the body of football. Often these
  accusations will be levelled by the very same people who argue that shouting
  at horses to run faster somehow constitutes the highest form of sporting
  endeavour. And then at the other end of the scale you have the argot and
  arcana of the self-styled “FPL community”: a weird, idiosyncratic and above
  all deeply obsessive place, a rabbit hole of game theory and sprawling
  colour-coded spreadsheets, where grown men are brought to the brink of
  insanity by late fixture rearrangements, where Eddie Howe press conference
  footage is parsed in microscopic detail. Did he say Anthony Gordon “is being
  assessed” or “has been assessed”? Please. My family is dying. People earn
  their living from fantasy football these days. People write PhDs on it. There
  are interminable FPL podcasts, FPL YouTube channels, bespoke analysis tools,
  live events. Younger fans, who we constantly hear have little appetite for
  90-minute games, will spend many multiples of that watching a bloke on a
  webcam in his mum’s kitchen weighing up the merits of Murillo v Ola Aina, or
  whether Cody Gakpo constitutes a rotation risk. Even traditional media have
  begun to take the hint. FPL content has infiltrated the Sky Sports News
  ticker, the BBC Sport website, the Google search algorithm, player interviews,
  radio commentary. Celebrities play it. Footballers play it. Ange Postecoglou
  dolefully admitted on arriving at Tottenham that he’d been forced to leave his
  friends’ fantasy league for the first time in 20 years. Gradually,
  insidiously, fantasy football has seeped into the way we cover and consume
  football: a shadow game that has become almost inimical to the real thing. In
  a way this is a development that has taken place in parallel with the Premier
  League itself. Frank Skinner’s and David Baddiel’s Fantasy Football League was
  first broadcast in 1993, the Daily Telegraph introduced its seminal
  play-by-mail game in 1994, and in hindsight these were the first evolutionary
  twirls of what we now have to describe as the EPL global cinematic universe.
  Games, jokes, daydreams and deep dives, idle chatter and hot takes: an empire
  of content centred on the weekend fixture list but slowly rumbling into every
  corner of our lives. For the Premier League itself, the game and its 11
  million players constitute not so much a revenue stream – the game is free to
  play and always has been – as a kind of awesome soft power. In an age when
  viewers are increasingly selective about the football they watch, fantasy
  football gives every minute of every game a certain relevance. Whether
  Bournemouth claim a late consolation while losing 3-0 at Manchester City has
  almost zero relevance in the real world. But if you’re counting on a Josko
  Gvardiol clean sheet, you may just carry on watching to the very end. And so
  fantasy sport occupies a kind of strange middle status: utterly contingent on
  the action while somehow entirely detached from it. In this regard it is not a
  million miles from the fan fiction and user-generated narratives that populate
  so many youth-oriented subcultures, a way of putting your own stamp on the
  game, a vehicle for expression and cognition, a way of being an active
  participant rather than a passive consumer. Naturally the whiff of
  condescension will always follow fantasy football, in the same way video games
  have always been regarded as a lower and more banal form of cultural output.
  But frankly, is it any less valid a way of consuming Premier League football
  than the other forms of obsession associated with it? Is it any more trivial
  or frivolous than living vicariously through transfer gossip, or writing long
  boring threads about football accountancy, or taking an interest in who Morgan
  Gibbs-White’s partner has decided to unfollow on Instagram, or where referees
  come from? Like all forms of mass culture, football generates hinterlands in
  abundance. Perhaps in a certain light it is possible to see fantasy football
  as the least toxic of them: not as aggressive as social media discourse, not
  as socially harmful as gambling, not as demented as conspiracy theory. For its
  most devoted practitioners it offers a form of community and agency, a weekly
  microdose of triumph and disaster, an emotional stake in a game that so often
  regards its fans as raw consumers. At least, for now. As with anything wildly
  popular, the explosion of FPL has been accompanied by the usual agents of
  greed and grift, exploitation and opportunism. Money leagues, while
  theoretically banned, continue to flourish. The market in artificial
  intelligence tools and insider knowledge, paywalled by premium subscriptions,
  has gone through the roof. In recent years professional poker players have
  increasingly begun to migrate to FPL. Meanwhile the passageway from fantasy
  sport to problem gambling is smoothed by the numerous betting companies
  targeting FPL content for advertising and partnerships. And perhaps none of
  this has ever moved you in the slightest, never has, never will. But on some
  level FPL does articulate what has always been one of the great unexplored
  tensions in football. To what extent do the ephemera and subcultures of a
  sport enrich the true essence of the game, and to what extent do they dilute
  it? What happens when the sideshow dissolves into the main show? Established
  as a harmless bit of fun, built through community, grown through popular
  demand, and now under assault by big money and big tech: on reflection,
  perhaps fantasy football is a pretty good model for the game itself.
