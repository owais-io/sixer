  Russia is believed to have jammed the satellite signal of a plane carrying the
  European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, over Bulgaria, reportedly
  forcing it to circle an airport for an hour. Von der Leyen was travelling to
  Plovdiv on Sunday when her charter plane lost satellite navigation aids,
  delaying its arrival in the central Bulgarian city. The commission deputy
  spokesperson Arianna Podestà confirmed the incident. “We have received
  information from the Bulgarian authorities that they suspect this was due to
  blatant interference by Russia. Of course, we are aware and used to … the
  threats and intimidations that are a regular component of Russia’s hostile
  behaviour,” she said. Interference with satellite navigation has become
  increasingly common in airspace near Russia and it is unclear whether von der
  Leyen was deliberately targeted. Asked about this point, Podestà said: “The
  question is best asked to the Russians.” Major airports use a variety of tools
  to navigate and land if GPS is not working, including radio navigation, which
  is reliable. The incident was first reported by the Financial Times, which
  said von der Leyen’s plane circled Plovdiv airport for an hour. The incident
  happened during a four-day trip by von der Leyen to seven EU member states on
  the bloc’s eastern border. In Vilnius on Monday, von der Leyen did not mention
  the incident but spoke of “constant military and hybrid threats” facing
  Lithuania. Referring to two drones that crossed Lithuania’s border with
  Belarus last month, she said: “As Lithuania is being tested, Europe as a whole
  is being tested.” The commission spokesperson said the incident “only
  reinforce[s] even further our unshakeable commitment to ramp up defence
  capabilities and our support for Ukraine”. In March 2024, Russia was believed
  to have been responsible for jamming the signal of a plane carrying Grant
  Shapps, the then UK defence secretary, who was returning to the UK from
  Poland. The RAF plane was affected by GPS interference for about 30 minutes
  while it flew near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. It was reported at the
  time that it was unclear whether Shapps was the target. GPS jamming and
  “spoofing” – an electronic warfare tactic that causes incorrect navigation
  information to be displayed – has increased since Russia’s full-scale invasion
  of Ukraine in 2022 and escalated even more sharply in the last year. In June,
  13 EU member states raised the alarm about jamming and spoofing threats
  disrupting air and sea travel. Poland recorded 2,732 cases of electronic
  interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in October 2023, while Lithuania
  recorded 1,185 cases in the same month, up from 556 in March 2024, according
  to an internal EU document drafted in May. The document describes interference
  to global satellite navigation systems as “not random incidents but a
  systemic, deliberate action by Russia and Belarus”. It says: “Causing
  significant damage has been simple and cheap” and is likely to continue
  without “proportional countermeasures”. The commission said on Monday it had
  imposed sanctions on several companies involved in GPS signal disruption “in
  the very obvious blatant case of these originating from Russia”. It said it
  was developing an aviation-specific plan and broader strategies to prevent
  jamming. Separately, Ukrainian police have accused Russia of involvement in
  the weekend killing of a former parliamentary speaker and pro-western
  politician. Andriy Parubiy, a key figure in Ukraine’s anti-Russia movement,
  was shot dead in the western city of Lviv on Saturday by a man dressed as a
  delivery driver. The national police chief, Ivan Vyhivskyi, said on Facebook:
  “We know that this crime was not accidental. There is Russian involvement.
  Everyone will be held accountable before the law.” He said the killer
  disguised himself as a courier and opened fire on Parubiy in broad daylight,
  firing his weapon eight times. The shooter made sure that the victim was dead,
  Vyhivskyi said. “He spent a long time preparing, watching, planning, and
  finally pulling the trigger. It took us only 36 hours to track him down and
  arrest him,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the “horrific murder” had
  affected “security in a country at war”. Hopes for a ceasefire are low after
  last month’s summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump provided no
  tangible results. A deadline set by the US president at the summit for the
  Russian leader to take action to end the war or face new sanctions is due to
  expire this week. Trump has a history of delaying threatened action. On Friday
  Emmanuel Macron said Putin was trying to “play” Trump. Von der Leyen said
  Ukraine’s allies were working on security guarantees. She described the first
  line of defence as “a strong, well-equipped and experienced” Ukrainian army,
  and the second as “a multinational group from the coalition of the willing,
  with the backstop of the Americans”. About 30 countries – known as the
  coalition of the willing – have pledged support for Ukraine but it remains
  unclear how many European countries would send troops or how those forces
  could be deployed. The US expects European countries to do the heavy lifting
  but could provide logistical support. Zelenskyy is expected to meet European
  leaders in Paris on Thursday as part of an attempt to force an end to Russia’s
  three-and-a-half-year-old invasion.
