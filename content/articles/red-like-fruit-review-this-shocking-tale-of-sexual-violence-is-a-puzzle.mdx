webTitle: Red Like Fruit review – this shocking tale of sexual violence is a puzzle
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-10T04:00:13Z'
bodyText: >-
  This two-hander about consent, abuse and the doubt cast over women’s
  testimonies is magnetically minimalist. Lauren (Michelle Monteith) tells us
  that Luke (David Patrick Flemming), who enters the stage beside her, will tell
  her story. Later, we find out that she is a journalist, and so perfectly
  capable of telling it herself. Yet the telling is ceded to Luke. It begins
  with a newspaper assignment for a case of domestic abuse. She speaks to the
  survivor, the perpetrator and the company boss who re-employed the latter
  despite his assault. The experience sends Lauren to her own past – traumatic
  memories of being sexually violated and raped by a family member. Cleverly
  directed by Christian Barry, there is tension and horror. You lean in and
  listen. Lauren looks on as her story is narrated by Luke, her face registering
  the shocks. Premiering in Edinburgh, the acclaimed Canadian playwright Hannah
  Moscovitch’s drama this week won a Fringe First award. Its themes overlap with
  those in Inter Alia, currently playing at the National Theatre in London, and
  Heidi Schreck’s masterful What the Constitution Means to Me. So what niggles
  and makes Red Like Fruit feel, beneath the surface, confected? In its framing,
  with Luke speaking for Lauren, there is an obvious analogy of the way women’s
  stories are often silenced or co-opted by men. But what is Lauren’s position?
  Is she pointing this out, in silent condemnation, or is she willingly
  deferring the power of her testimony to Luke? She later explains that words
  are simply more believed when men speak them. Given the low conviction rates
  for rape charges, where women’s accounts are challenged, this is apt. But if
  this is the point of Luke’s ventriloquism, it seems too obvious and slightly
  gimmicky. Lauren is a strangely drawn character. She has internalised the
  misogyny, talking about the overweight women in her therapy group, and
  thinking herself a failure for being there, reassuring herself that she is a
  successful mother and wife. And she is slowly rising up against the
  conditioning to stay quiet about men’s damaging behaviour. But she is too
  naive: charmed by the company boss who justifies domestic violence and knowing
  she’s angry but not sure about what. What makes rape at the hands of a family
  member any different from sex that you regret, she asks Luke. It sounds too
  basic a question on consent from a journalist working on a domestic violence
  case, about a subject that has been in the air for many years. It all feels
  pre rather than post #MeToo. Maybe that is the point? None of these worries
  detract from the dramatic power of this piece. Tension remains strong, and the
  stories of abuse and undermining of women linger long afterwards. It’s just
  the mode of their telling that feels off. • At Traverse theatre, Edinburgh,
