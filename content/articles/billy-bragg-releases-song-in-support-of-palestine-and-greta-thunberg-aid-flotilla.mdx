  Billy Bragg has released a new original song to show his support for the
  people of Palestine. The title of Hundred Year Hunger was inspired by a new
  book of the same name by E Mark Windle about the history of chronic
  malnutrition and deprivation in Gaza and will raise money for the Amos Trust’s
  Gaza Appeal. Writing on Instagram, the British protest singer said that the
  song “looks at the current famine that Israel has created in Gaza through the
  lens of a century of enforced food insecurity and malnutrition imposed on the
  Palestinian people, firstly by British imperialism, then as a weapon of mass
  displacement by the state of Israel”. The song was released to coincide with a
  new humanitarian aid flotilla – with Greta Thunberg among their number –
  setting sail from Barcelona to try to “break the illegal siege of Gaza”,
  organisers said. The intention is to open a humanitarian corridor and deliver
  aid to an area gripped by famine. It is expected to arrive in mid-September.
  Israel previously blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to
  Gaza. Last week, an Israel military spokesperson said it would no longer pause
  fighting to allow aid deliveries in Gaza city, a decision likely to intensify
  the famine in the northern part of the territory. “Now my children ask me why
  the watching world is standing by / While Israel creates famine as a weapon in
  their war,” Bragg sings in the track. The chorus of the song is in Arabic.
  Bragg explained that “sumud” translates as “steadfastness or perseverance. It
  is used by Palestinians to describe their nonviolent everyday resistance
  against Israel’s occupation. Sumud emphasises the commitment of the
  Palestinian people to remain on their land despite hardship and oppression,
  elevating their everyday existence into a form of resistance.” A second term,
  “lan narhal”, Bragg wrote, “translates as ‘we will not leave’. Together
  ‘Sumud! Sumud! Lan narhal’ conveys the determination of the Palestinian people
  to refuse to be displaced.” On 20 September, Bragg is hosting a Palestine
  benefit gig, Days Like These, at London’s O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire, featuring
  acts including Jamie Webster, Billy Nomates, Antony Szmierek, Reverend and the
  Makers and Big Special, to support the Amos Trust’s Gaza Appeal. He previously
  expressed his support for the Irish rap trio Kneecap, charged with allegedly
  displaying a flag supporting the proscribed terrorist organisation Hezbollah
  last year. Bragg said in May: “The charging of Kneecap’s Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh
  with a terrorism offence by the Metropolitan Police is the latest development
  of a disturbing and broader trend over the past few years during which the
  state has sought to criminalise creative expression.” Bragg released his last
  album, The Million Things That Never Happened, in 2021.
