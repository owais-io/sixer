  The first mention of five-a-day, as a fruit and vegetable diet ideal was in
  California in the late 80s, but didn’t reach the chattering crudité classes
  until the mid-90s. I once wrote a food diary for a magazine, in which it
  turned out I’d had one vegetable across the space of a week, when someone in a
  cafe slipped some spinach under my fried egg. Eating five a day was harder
  than it looked, particularly if you didn’t like tomatoes and hated fruit.
  There was a bit of debate around whether potatoes counted (they don’t),
  whether bananas and avocados were false friends (nobody ever got to the bottom
  of that) and how much lettuce counted as a portion, given that it is basically
  air. Later, there was a little consternation at how much influence had been
  wielded by the fruit and vegetable industry. But the late, much-missed Michael
  Mosley made the adjudication in 2013 that the advice was pretty solid, and
  that was considered a good enough reason to follow the rule (at least for
  people who had the budget and headroom to follow rules). So, of course, with
  all its controversies having been leached out of it by the passage of time,
  all its strictures being not that strict, five-a-day was bound to be torched
  by rebels sooner or later, and in 2018 – again, it’s taken a while to
  percolate – the rule became to eat 30 different plants a week. The immediate
  problem is naming 30 different plants, never mind eating them. I tried it
  alphabetically and timed out at “carrot”. Seeds are also considered a plant,
  and herbs and spices count, but only to the value of a quarter of a point, so
  now you have a maths challenge, on top of everything else. The lesson here is:
  don’t surrender. The minute we’re all eating 30 different plants, the new
  normal will be 60. You’ll soon be foraging for nettles. • Zoe Williams is a
