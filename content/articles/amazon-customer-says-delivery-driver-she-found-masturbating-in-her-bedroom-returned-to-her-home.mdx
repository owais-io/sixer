  An Amazon customer who complained to the online retailer about a delivery
  driver coming into her home and masturbating in her bedroom is demanding to
  know how the man was allowed to return to her house two days later. Spanish
  police have taken a suspected semen sample allegedly left by the courier as
  part of a continuing investigation into the incident. The customer, a
  72-year-old retired British social worker who lives in Spain and New Zealand,
  had ordered a mosquito repellant on Amazon Marketplace. Jane* said: “I will
  not be using Amazon again. I want people to know that it’s unsafe.” Amazon
  said the courier was not one of its employees but a contractor for one of its
  local sellers. The courier, a tall man in his 20s, arrived with the package at
  Jane’s home in a village on the Costa Brava, north-east Spain, at around 5pm
  on 15 July. She buzzed him in through a gate to her home via a video doorbell
  and asked him to wait. After a trip to the bathroom Jane said she then found
  the man in her bedroom with his hand in his shorts. He had entered Jane’s
  house and walked through her kitchen and up her stairs into her bedroom, she
  said. “I was stunned,” she told the Guardian. “He was masturbating vigorously.
  He turned his back and it was apparent that he ejaculated. He shook his hand
  and when he turned to me his shorts were wet.” She added: “I can think a lot
  of things I should have said to him now, but I was so shocked I just told him
  to get out immediately and I followed him out.” Once outside, the courier
  asked for Jane’s ID number to register the package on an electronic device. He
  struggled to input the data correctly, which prompted his older colleague, who
  had been waiting in a van, to come to the door to ask about the delay. Jane,
  who was awarded New Zealand’s order of merit for a charity work, said: “I told
  him: ‘Your colleague has done something very bad.’ My Spanish did not extend
  to the word masturbate.” The older driver said there was a problem registering
  the package before snatching it from Jane’s hands. Both men then left the
  property. She managed to photograph the van and its number plate before it
  drove away. Jane reported the incident to the police and to an Amazon
  helpline. The call handler apologised to her for the “inconvenience”. She
  said: “I told her: ‘This is a police matter, it’s not an inconvenience. This
  is threatening behaviour by one of your couriers.’” Jane’s anger at the
  company increased when two days later the same two couriers turned up at her
  door to deliver another Amazon package. “I felt very vulnerable, especially
  when he came back another time,” she said. Jane said she addressed the older
  man by saying: “‘Your colleague masturbated in my house.’ – I knew the word by
  then – ‘and I’ve reported it to the police. He denied it. He said his shorts
  were wet after spilling a drink.” Before leaving, the older man threatened to
  denounce her to the police for making the accusation against his colleague. On
  the second visit, her video doorbell captured an image of the suspected
  intruder, which she passed to the police. A report into the incident by
  Spanish police, seen by the Guardian, confirmed that an investigation has been
  launched into Jane’s “report of a person entering her home without her consent
  and masturbating in front of her”. Jane has been in correspondence with Amazon
  since the incident. In an initial message to its customer email
  Jeff@amazon.com – a reference to its chief executive, Jeff Bezos – she wrote:
  “Amazon should take immediate steps to safeguard their customers in a case
  such as this. Your helpline people were in not way equipped to deal such a
  situation of sexual abuse.” Jane said: “I can’t imagine Jeff [Bezos] reading
  through complaints on his honeymoon. There doesn’t seem to be an adequate
  complaints system. There seems to have been no attempt to address what was a
  serious home invasion and sexual violence against me.” “As they are making
  squillions out of this, they absolutely should be spending a good bunch of it
  making sure customers are safe in their homes.” In another message to Amazon
  she wrote: “I cannot risk using Amazon again when the same courier may make
  the delivery and when they show such disregard for the safety and wellbeing of
  the customers. In one of Amazon Spain’s replies sent to Jane on 18 July, it
  conceded that the incident was “extremely concerning” but it pointed out that
  the delivery service and personnel were not Amazon employees or contracted by
  Amazon directly. It urged Jane to contact the seller and said it supported her
  decision to report the incident to the police. In a statement Amazon said: “At
  Amazon, we take the security and protection of our customers and the
  communities we serve very seriously. This service was provided by a commercial
  carrier. We will keep investigating and clarifying the facts and we will
  cooperate with the parties that need our collaboration.” * Name has been
