  The Crunch: The shrinking space to exist in Gaza; redrawing the world map; and
  are there any safe seats on a plane?

  Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch! In this week’s newsletter
  we have charts on the safest seat on an airplane, the number and heights of
  Scottish mountains, and the cumulative impact of evacuation orders in Gaza.
  But first … How Trump has supercharged the immigration crackdown We’re sorry
  to say we missed this excellent piece of work from our colleagues in the US
  when it was first published, so we’re remedying the oversight now. Based on
  data from a freedom of information request, Maanvi Singh, Will Craft and
  Andrew Witherspoon were able to show that despite Trump’s claims that his
  administration is seeking out the “worst of the worst”, the majority of people
  being arrested by Ice now have no criminal convictions: The huge ramp-up in
  arrests has resulted in detention facilities becoming increasingly
  overcrowded, and the US system is over capacity by more than 13,500 people.
  Read more here. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. No seat is safe
  Following a horrific crash of an Air India flight in June – in which one
  person survived – Reuters has taken a deep dive into how rare it is for people
  to survive such crashes, and whether some seats are safer than others. Looking
  at 1400 plane crashes where there were survivors, they concluded that there is
  no safe seat. Instead, survival depends on an interplay of many factors –
  impact angles, speed, and evacuation conditions among them. We really
  recommend you click through and explore the data and timeline in the story.
  *** 2. The shrinking space to exist in Gaza The ABC have cobbled together all
  the different evacuation orders that Israel has issued in Gaza since March
  this year, revealing how little space is left. One of the people the ABC
  talked to said she had been forced to move more than 30 times over the course
  of the war. The interactive in this article is really powerful – it gives not
  only the sense of scale, but the repetition and cumulative effect over time.
  *** 3. A third of outpatients treated for wounds at MSF’s Gaza hospitals in
  2024 were children, figures show Statistics published by The Lancet, and
  covered by the Guardian here, show the terrible damage Israeli strikes are
  doing to Palestinians. Children under 15 years old made up almost a third of
  outpatients treated for wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans
  Frontières (MSF), according to the data: According to MSF, the majority of
  violent trauma injuries were from bombs and shelling, due to explosive weapons
  being used in dense urban areas. *** 4. You call that a mountain munro? We’re
  big fans of Tidy Tuesday – a weekly “social data project” where people from
  around the world, using different tools and languages, create visuals using
  the same dataset. This week it was a dataset of “munros” – a Scottish mountain
  with an elevation greater than 3,000 feet. Dr Lucia Layritz from the UC
  Berkley put together this beautiful time series of the number of munros over
  time. “The reason the numbers vary is because there is not a very clear
  definition of what a munro is, so upon re-surveying they sometimes get taken
  out of the list again,” Layritz told The Crunch. We also loved this ridge map
  of where the munros are. This density chart of munro height. A map of munro
  density and spread. And this one on munro classification. Bookmarks Using
  LiDAR to show before and after the LA fires What is next for Sydney’s darling
  harbour? Hundreds of migrants are still dying in the Mediterranean “1899 was
  the peak year for African-American patents per capita. It still is.” Nvidia’s
  financial results Off the Charts There’s no “correct” way to project a sphere
  (such as Earth) on to a flat surface. But some ways may be better than others.
  The African union has endorsed a campaign to adopt an “Equal Earth
  projection”, which some say more accurately reflects the true size of Africa.
  You can see this in a graphic from the New York Times: The standard world map
  most of us know uses a projection called Mercator (Google Maps, for instance,
  uses a modified version of Mercator). Mercator projections tend to exaggerate
  areas around the poles and shrink areas near the equator. You can see in the
  Mercator map above that Greenland appears about the same size as Africa. In
  reality Africa is many, many times larger than Greenland. If this has piqued
  your interest, here’s an interactive notebook that visualises a bunch of
  different world map projections. All of them have their own issues – when
  you’re flattening a sphere the distortion has to go somewhere. Sinusoidal
  projections for the win. Sign up If you would like to receive The Crunch to
