  It’s the kind of day you wouldn’t believe is winter when Andy Griffiths and I
  meet – crisp blue sky, barely a tussle of wind and a temperature warm enough
  to breathe and think. We both arrive 10 minutes early to his childhood home on
  a steep street in Vermont, a suburb that was very much the fringe of Melbourne
  when Griffiths grew up, but now is comfortably in the eastern suburbs. Built
  in the 60s, the brown brick house hasn’t changed much. “It’s really
  comforting,” says Griffiths. “This was a really great place to grow up,” he
  says, “because there were kids everywhere.” He points to the houses on the
  corner, reflecting on his neighbours. “There was always someone out on the
  street to play with or talk to, or little kids to tell silly stories to, and
  there were dogs everywhere.” At the bottom of the intersecting street is a
  pine forest that leads to Dandenong Creek. We walk down slowly, stopping to
  ponder the trees. “It feels a little bit lighter than it did. Or maybe it’s
  just me who’s changed, but it did feel a lot darker and more mysterious. It’s
  like you’re in another little world.” The trees stand tall, with very few
  low-lying branches, not at all good for climbing. Every other kind of
  mischief, however, was within this open circle of trees: dragsters with banana
  seats, making up outrageous stories, hiding beers for teenage parties, and
  firecrackers. “It was one of those childhoods where you’d go out in the
  morning and didn’t really have to come home until it got dark.” Griffiths’
  father was an industrial chemist, with a knack for building things and for
  gardening. His mother was a midwife who ran the secondhand book stall at the
  school fete, filling the house with all sorts of books donated from the
  neighbourhood. Griffiths often had first dibs, and still has some of those
  books, spanning from fiction to philosophy. “They’re really precious reading
  experiences, because they’re not necessarily what you would have given to a
  kid, but they just opened up the world to me. I often muse back on that and
  think: something was looking after me there.” Children’s books did still
  appeal to him, however, and he loved Enid Blyton from an early age. “I loved
  her because she’d just get the kids away from the parents in the first
  chapter, plunge them into danger or an adventure.” The tattooed punk
  children’s author is rather dapper in a tweed jacket over a cardigan vest and
  wearing a trilby hat, but still at home in the forest, leading us the
  “traditional way” that the kids would go down to the creek. He compares the
  creek to Winnie-the-Pooh’s Hundred Acre Wood, a place of freedom. Freedom
  comes up a lot in conversation – not necessarily in a large political sense
  but rather the freedom to imagine, to play and to explore the world without
  adults present. He didn’t know the years of unobserved childhood wandering
  around the creek would become the bones of his career, spanning four decades,
  although his résumé also includes bottle shop worker, punk vocalist and
  English teacher. Griffiths has made an impressive career spanning four decades
  of writing for six-to-10-year-olds, an age at which he says, “Anything is
  possible. They’re still in that phase where the world is large. You don’t know
  what’s quite true or what’s not true,” he says, slowing down for a moment.
  Despite reports that children, especially boys, are reading less and
  struggling more with literacy, Griffiths is mostly optimistic, meeting
  thousands of kids a year. “Parents do have a role to play in ensuring a
  balance in their kids’ lives, a balance between outside play, gaming, reading.
  Because [in] reading, while you’re getting that intense experience, you’re
  gaining literacy skills, which make such a difference to every aspect of your
  life, which I think is a pity that that’s being lost through neglect. “At the
  same time, there’s more books for kids than there ever was for more varied
  readerships. So much more.” His own childhood took place during the golden age
  of reading, as Griffiths calls it. “We weren’t spending all our time reading
  books, because we had our dragsters and we had the keys to the kingdom.” But
  he had the best of both worlds: playing for hours, all children together, and
  also getting lost in books, simply because, “we had many spare hours growing
  up that couldn’t be filled with anything else”. We leave the forest by a sharp
  ascent over muddy grass and rocks, returning to the block around Griffith’s
  childhood home, heading towards the old milk bar. “I want to keep writing the
  type of thing that a particular reader really craves. It’s the most positive
  way I can think to make a difference. What I’m doing is translating what I
  loved in my childhood reading, finding that essence and the spirit of it and
  modernising it and passing it on.” His newest series, working with Bill Hope,
  is a change of direction after 30 years of collaboration with Terry Denton on
  the Treehouse series. The series with Denton ended after 13 books, published
  from 2011 to 2023, which sold more than 10m copies and were published in more
  than 35 languages. The series was a slightly unexpected hit internationally –
  Griffiths’ previous series had only received local success. “I just thought
  our particular flavour of humour was like Vegemite,” he says. “There was an
  outpouring of grief by dedicated readers and their parents [when the Treehouse
  series ended]. And they were like, you can’t stop. And I was like, well, I
  have,” he says, “But it doesn’t mean I’m going to stop writing.” He knew where
  he was going next. Over the years, many children had written to him, asking if
  they could appear in a book, because obviously that wouldn’t be too much
  trouble, which led to the idea of the ubiquitous main characters in his latest
  book, You and Me, illustrated only as a pair of adventure costumes to leave
  their appearance to the imagination. You &amp; Me is an adventure series, in
  which the main characters are called You and Me, which serves to encourage
  reading aloud. The second book, You &amp; Me and the Peanut Butter Beast,
  firmly establishes the characters: Me, who wants to follow the rules, and You,
  who is more impulsive. Then there is Johnny Knucklehead, a reappearing
  swindler who started out as just a name in Griffiths’ head until Bill Hope
  sent over some drawings, the final sketch now tattooed on Griffiths’ palm.
  Keeping in touch with a childlike sense of imagination, play and humour is
  something that Griffiths considers greatly. “I allow myself to do things that
  appear to have no ostensible value or purpose,” he says, permitting himself to
  spend hours in a record shop and rereading childhood favourite books. “You
  come away restored and buzzing with the excitement. It adds richness.”
  Griffiths says he always knows when he is working too much – everything is a
  chore and not much fun. Humour, he says, has great value, not just because it
  is pleasurable to laugh, but because it can shift frames of thinking.
  “Laughter throws the switch back to openness where you’ve got the potential to
  make a more creative decision than just grimly doing whatever needs to be
  done.” For now, what excites him – like he is 13 years old again – is the fact
  the Alice Cooper Band is releasing their first album in 50 years. “It’s really
  good to allow ourselves to be excited by whatever it is.” Andy Griffiths’
  latest book, You &amp; Me and the Peanut Butter Beast, is out on 19 August
