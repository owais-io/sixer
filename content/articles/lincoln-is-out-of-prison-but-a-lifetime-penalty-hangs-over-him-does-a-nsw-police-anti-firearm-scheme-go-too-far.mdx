  Lincoln* calls his firearm prohibition order (FPO) a “lifetime punishment”. It
  was placed on him after he left prison, and Lincoln says it made it difficult
  to feel as if he had a fresh start. Even when dating a new partner, he had to
  have a difficult conversation: that anywhere they went – at home or even in a
  car – he could be searched by police without a warrant due to the FPO. “I’d
  been studying and working, doing all that kind of stuff, but still had that
  fear that at any minute they could come through the door,” Lincoln, who lives
  in Sydney, says. Weapon and firearm prohibition orders, which never expire,
  can be made if police deem that someone is not fit, in the public interest, to
  possess a firearm or weapon. Thousands of people in New South Wales are living
  under these orders – some as young as 14, others in their 80s and 90s. A
  Guardian Australia report in May revealed FPOs are disproportionately placed
  on Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The majority of under-18s
  served with a FPO identified as Aboriginal. New data obtained from NSW police
  shows similar results for weapon prohibition orders (WPOs), which are often
  served simultaneously: of the 78 people served with a WPO under age 18, 55%
  identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. About 51% of the 4,267
  people in NSW with WPOs identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander – a
  “concerning level of over-representation”, according to Jonathan Hall Spence,
  the principal solicitor with the Justice and Equity Centre. In response to
  questions from Guardian Australia, NSW police pointed to recent amendments to
  the procedures that govern FPOs and WPOs, including an independent review of
  any applications of FPOs for those under 18 by the commander of the firearms
  registry and an internal review of adult FPOs every five years. A debt after
  sentence served Timothy Roberts, the president of the NSW Council for Civil
  Liberties, said the FPO and WPO regime is an example of how the criminal
  justice system is increasingly being used punitively rather than for helping
  people rebuild or change. “You’ve got a situation here where someone can walk
  out the door of a prison sentence that would serve their debt to the
  community, but then the police at their own discretion create a debt of their
  own,” he said. Claude Robinson knows more about this than most. At Rainbow
  Lodge in Sydney, Robinson helps men who have recently left prison get back on
  their feet. The long-running residential support program assists all sorts of
  people, but he’s recently had to make a new rule: men with weapon and firearm
  prohibition orders can no longer stay there. Robinson’s particular worry is
  how police deliver these orders. The first time someone was served with a FPO
  at the lodge, police called ahead, Robinson says. The next time, it was
  different: police came early in the morning with masks and weapons with no
  warning and pulled the man out in his underwear. Robinson says they served the
  order and searched the man’s room, finding nothing. His program tries to teach
  men that if you behave in what Robinson calls “a pro-social way”, that the
  criminal justice system becomes irrelevant to your life. A show of force like
  this risks undoing the work of the program for everyone staying there, he
  says, and that’s why men with these orders can no longer stay at the lodge –
  cutting off an important rehabilitative opportunity. “The police turn up here
  in riot gear and … undo what it’s taken us three months to get people to
  believe in 10 minutes,” Robinson says. Legal doubts and questions FPOs and
  WPOs are applied at police discretion – not by a court. There is no
  requirement that the person committed a firearm or weapon-related offence.
  Alongside criminal history or gang associations, police can consider factors
  such as traffic infringements that demonstrate “a general disregard for the
  law” when considering whether to make an FPO, according to NSW police standard
  operating procedures obtained by Guardian Australia. While both FPOs and WPOs
  do not expire, the latter cannot be appealed to the NSW Civil and
  Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) – a situation affirmed in a 2020 decision
  before the tribunal. In his NCAT findings, Geoffrey Walker, a University of
  Queensland emeritus professor, remarked on submissions that argued “most
  Australians would consider it unfair that a person should remain subject to a
  WPO, with its concomitant liability to warrantless search and seizure … long
  after the circumstances that caused the commissioner to form the opinion … had
  ceased to exist.” The FPO scheme’s enhanced search powers mean police can
  search someone with an FPO or their premises or car at any time, “as
  reasonably required”, to determine if they have committed an offence by having
  a firearm, firearm parts or ammunition. While they were introduced in 2013 to
  combat gun crime, legal advocates have raised questions about the efficacy of
  FPO search powers, and whether they’re being used as a surveillance tool
  rather than gun control. In 2023-24, police found firearms or firearm
  accessories in only 1.36% of 8,651 searches. The year before, there were only
  nine occasions when a firearm-related item was found out of 9,731 searches.
  According to the police FPO procedures, if police find other illegal items
  during a search, they must identify another legal authority to seize them.
  Brendan*, a former resident at Rainbow Lodge, didn’t know what an FPO or WPO
  involved when he first received them from police. When he understood the FPO
  meant anywhere he went could be searched without notice, he stopped
  socialising out of concern that he would inadvertently bring police to the
  doors of friends and family. It’s hard to move on when “that’s hanging over
  our head all the time”, Brendan says. “[I’m] on edge all the time, waiting
  [for them] to bang on the door.” ‘Carte blanche’ search powers Both Lincoln
  and Brendan agree that they can see the purpose of something like an FPO if
  someone has committed a violent offence using a firearm, but are frustrated
  these orders are not decided in court. Typically, no lawyers are present when
  they’re served. Robinson is also worried about the impact of these orders and
  what he calls the “carte blanche” of FPO search powers on men trying to
  rebuild their lives after prison. “It continues that negative relationship
  that the men who come here have with the police and [the belief] police do
  treat them differently,” Robinson says. “That window of change where things
  need to get better is small and this doesn’t help them.” Lincoln served the
  time that Australia’s justice system decided was his punishment, but now he
  feels he has another never-expiring penalty hanging over him. “You’re saying,
  I want to be a completely different person with a different friend group and
  different work … but I’m also hiding this secret that ties me to a life I used
  to have and means that I’m different to everyone else. “It’s painful and I
  don’t think it’s fair.” * First names only used for privacy reasons.
