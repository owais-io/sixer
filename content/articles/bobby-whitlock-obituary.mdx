  In a career that found him collaborating with some of the most illustrious
  musicians of his era, including George Harrison, the Rolling Stones, Sam &amp;
  Dave, Booker T &amp; the MGs, Dr John and Stephen Stills, it was his work with
  Eric Clapton that rubber-stamped Bobby Whitlock’s place in rock’n’roll
  history. In particular, he will be remembered for his writing and playing
  contributions to the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970), often
  considered Clapton’s finest achievement. Clapton first came across Whitlock, a
  keyboard player and singer, who has died of cancer aged 77, when he was a
  member of the rock-soul act Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends (formed by the
  married couple Bonnie and Delaney Bramlett). Clapton liked them so much that
  he recruited them as the opening act for his band Blind Faith on their sole
  tour in 1969, and they would also appear on Clapton’s first solo album, Eric
  Clapton (1970). The live album On Tour with Eric Clapton (1970) cracked the US
  Top 30 and was Delaney &amp; Bonnie’s most successful release. Whitlock quit
  the Delaney &amp; Bonnie band after recording their album To Bonnie from
  Delaney (1970), and hooked up with Clapton in England. Along with two further
  Delaney &amp; Bonnie alumni, the bassist Carl Radle and the drummer Jim
  Gordon, the foursome became Derek and the Dominos, a name designed to give
  Clapton a measure of anonymity after his “supergroup” excesses with Cream and
  Blind Faith. As Whitlock put it to the Best Classic Bands website: “He wanted
  to be Derek, not Eric. He wasn’t ready to step into his role as a solo artist
  at that time.” The Layla double album (recorded at Criteria studios in Miami)
  was a pivotal release in Clapton’s history. It reached only No 16 on the US
  chart and did not chart at all in Britain, but its reputation grew steadily
  over succeeding decades. It was a momentous feat for Whitlock too, since he
  co-wrote six of the album’s songs with Clapton, including Bell Bottom Blues,
  Anyday, Tell the Truth and Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?, and played
  acoustic guitar and sang on his solo composition Thorn Tree in the Garden.
  This was a feverishly creative period, since the Dominos band came together
  while all four members were simultaneously involved in recording Harrison’s
  triple album All Things Must Pass, his first solo effort since the demise of
  the Beatles. When Harrison took a break from the sessions, he invited the
  foursome to use the studio, which enabled the Dominos to record their first
  single, Tell the Truth, with Roll It Over (another Clapton/Whitlock
  composition) for the B side. Intriguingly, while Clapton was inspired to write
  Layla’s title song by his infatuation with Harrison’s wife, Pattie Boyd,
  Whitlock dated Pattie’s sister, Paula, while he was in Britain. Whitlock later
  sold his rights to royalties from Derek and the Dominos, but Clapton and his
  management helped him to get them back. Bobby was born in Memphis, Tennessee,
  to James Whitlock and his wife, Ruby, and grew up in the city’s Millington
  district. James was a Baptist preacher renowned for his fiery oratory, traces
  of which could be discerned in his son’s singing. Bobby also first played the
  piano in his father’s church. As a teenager, Bobby could frequently be found
  at Memphis’s renowned Stax Records, where he got to know many of the local
  artists, including Booker T &amp; the MGs, Albert King and Sam &amp; Dave. He
  added handclaps to Sam &amp; Dave’s 1968 classic I Thank You. “It was a great
  time and town for music then, especially soul music,” he recalled. “It was
  loose and all about music everywhere that you turned.” As a professional
  musician Whitlock cut his teeth playing keyboards in the local bands the Short
  Cuts and the Counts, and Stax planned to record an album with him on its
  subsidiary label, Hip Records, making him the first white artist signed to
  Stax. However, Whitlock felt that they were trying to turn him into a
  lightweight pop artist – “It turned out to be bubblegum garbage music that
  they recorded with me” – so he was delighted to be recruited by the Bramletts
  instead. He travelled to Los Angeles to join them, and as he recalled it: “We
  started Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, just Delaney and Bonnie and myself.”
  Whitlock asserted that Derek and the Dominos were “the very best band on the
  planet … We were better than anybody,” but their progress was cut short by a
  surfeit of drugs and alcohol. The rock critic Robert Palmer described how he
  visited the Layla recording sessions in Miami and found that “there was a lot
  of dope around, especially heroin, and when I showed up, everyone was just
  spread out on the carpet, nodded out.” The Dominos split in 1971 after an
  abortive attempt to record a second album, though all the band members as well
  as the Bramletts and Harrison appeared on Whitlock’s debut solo album, Bobby
  Whitlock (1972). Reflecting on the Dominos in the Houston Press, Whitlock
  commented that “I am very happy that the one studio record was the ‘one’ and
  that was it. It never will have anything other than itself to be compared to.”
  He would release three more solo albums during the 70s, while his other
  musical activities included adding vocals to Dr John’s album The Sun, Moon
  &amp; Herbs (1971) and an appearance on the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main
  Street (1972). For the latter, Whitlock claimed he had co-written the track I
  Just Want to See His Face, but was not given a songwriting credit. In 1973 he
  played organ on Down the Road, the second album by Stephen Stills’s band
  Manassas, but found himself deprived of a songwriting credit for the track
  City Junkies, which was based on a jam between Whitlock and the drummer Dallas
  Taylor. During the 80s and 90s, Whitlock largely retired from music and
  retreated to a farm in Mississippi. He made a musical comeback in 1999 with
  the album It’s About Time. On Christmas Eve 2005 he married CoCo Carmel, a
  musician who had been married to Delaney Bramlett from 1987 to 2000, and the
  pair of them recorded several albums and made regular live appearances. From
  2006 to 2021 they lived in Austin, then moved to Ozona, Texas. In recent years
  he became a keen painter, and frequently had his work displayed in galleries.
  In 2010 he published a memoir, Bobby Whitlock: A Rock’n’Roll Autobiography,
  co-authored with Marc Roberty and with a foreword by Clapton. In May 2024 he
  was awarded a brass note on the Beale Street Walk of Fame in Memphis, an event
  he commemorated with a new song, Walking on Beale Street. He is survived by
  CoCo, his children Ashley, Beau and Tim, and his sister, Debbie. • Robert
  Stanley Whitlock, musician, singer and songwriter, born 18 March 1948; died 10
