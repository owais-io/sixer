  “We’re going in,” Donald Trump said on Tuesday, when asked whether national
  guard troops would be sent to invade Chicago. The comment came as reports
  emerged that national guard troops from Texas – not yet federalized under
  direct presidential control – were preparing to deploy to Chicago in the
  coming days, in defiance of the opposition repeatedly and forcefully expressed
  by the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker,
  both Democrats. The White House and the president’s allies have claimed that
  the deployment is a response to violent crime in Chicago. This is a lie. Crime
  in Chicago has dropped dramatically over the past decades, as it has in every
  major American city – including Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the national
  guard and the marines earlier this year, and Washington DC, where armed
  federal agents have patrolled the streets for much of the past month. The
  deployment of armed forces to American cities – serving at his pleasure even
  when they are not officially under his direct command – has nothing to do with
  “crime”, except insofar as the administration has sought to redefine the term
  to mean Democratic governance, racial pluralism or the presence of immigrants.
  There is no violent crime in Chicago, or in any of these cities, that federal
  troops can be usefully deployed to quell. Instead, the federal agents who will
  probably invade Chicago in the coming days are there to serve a very different
  purpose. They are there to assert Trump’s personal authority over government
  actions, to intimidate populations that did not vote for him, to terrorize and
  kidnap immigrants and destroy their families, and to make sure that every
  American knows that even if they succeed in electing Democrats to run their
  cities and states, the Trump regime can send armed men to their neighborhoods
  who answer to Republicans. As Trump expands his military occupation of
  opposition-controlled cities, the chances of a violent confrontation between
  armed agents of the regime and ordinary Americans rise dramatically. American
  city dwellers have not yet been terrified into silent submission; many of us
  still retain the self-respect that has been engendered by a lifetime of
  democratic citizenship. These people will inevitably, and righteously, protest
  the Trump administration’s incursions. They will shout with outrage when they
  see their neighbors dragged into vans by masked men; they will jeer and mock
  the jackboots sent to terrorize them. Eventually, it seems inevitable that
  someone will throw a rock, or slam a door too loudly, or frighten one of the
  masked, armed men who knows he has been deployed by an unpopular ruler to
  suppress a once-free public. And one of those men, terrified and hate-filled
  and ashamed, might, in that moment, fire his gun. By sending troops into
  cities that do not support him, the Trump administration is assembling
  kindling in neat stacks around a frayed and fragile civic peace; they are
  pouring lighter fluid, and lighting a match. They are hoping for a
  conflagration that will provide an excuse for even more brutality. It seems
  almost naive to ask if any of this is legal. The supreme court has made it
  clear that the president – or, at least, this president – has virtually no
  limits on his authority under conditions of an “emergency”. That no emergency
  is in evidence in Chicago or any of the other opposition-controlled cities
  that Trump-aligned forces are invading is irrelevant: an “emergency”, like a
  “crime”, can be whatever Trump wants it to be. The supreme court will,
  eventually, either greenlight Trump’s actions or delay intervening against him
  for long enough that he will be able to accomplish his aims anyway. But lower
  courts are showing more willingness to check Trump’s more flagrantly illegal
  conduct – at least temporarily. In California on Tuesday, a court ruled that
  Trump’s deployment of the marines and the federalized California national
  guard into Los Angeles earlier this year violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an
  1878 law that prohibits the use of federal armed services to enforce domestic
  law. But in Chicago, the Trump administration is trying a workaround:
  according to Pritzker, the troops that are amassing are un-federalized members
  of the Texas national guard – technically under the command of Greg Abbott,
  the governor, though unambiguously serving the president’s aims. If Pritzker’s
  claim – which Abbott’s office has disputed – is true, then the theory is
  apparently that Republican-controlled states have the authority to send their
  own troops into Democratic- controlled states – against the wishes and without
  the permission of the local authorities – to enforce partisan policy
  preferences. Pritzker, in an attempt to calm his people and prevent needless
  violence, implored Chicagoans to “not take the bait”. And certainly the ground
  forces will create some viral video moments that the president will enjoy
  posting to his followers. But the line between what is a mere performative
  display of power and what is an actual seizure of power is no longer quite
  clear. The boots and the guns, at any rate, are real. Moira Donegan is a
