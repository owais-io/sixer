  New York City’s former mayor Rudy Giuliani has been hospitalized after getting
  injured in a car wreck in New Hampshire over the weekend. On Sunday,
  Giuliani’s head of security, Michael Ragusa, released a statement, saying that
  the 81-year old was involved in a motor vehicle accident on Saturday evening.
  According to Ragusa, prior to the incident, Giuliani was flagged down by a
  woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident. “Mayor Giuliani
  immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911. He remained on scene until
  responding officers arrived to ensure her safety. Following this, while
  traveling on the highway, mayor Giuliani’s vehicle was struck from behind at
  high speed,” Ragusa said. Giuliani was transported to a nearby trauma center
  where he was treated for a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple cuts and
  bruises, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg. Giuliani’s
  business partner and medical provider were contacted and arrived at the
  hospital to oversee his care, Ragusa said, adding that Giuliani is in “good
  spirits and recovering tremendously”. He went on to say that the incident “was
  not a targeted attack” and urged the public to “refrain from spreading
  unfounded conspiracy theories”. In response to a comment from an X user who
  said: “Does anyone think the victim’s abuser waited for the car who helped
  her, to ram them? Maybe not even knowing it’s Giuliani,” Ragusa replied: “He
  was in a rent a car no one knew it was him.” In 2024, Giuliani took a tumble
  at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when he fell
  into some chairs. Following the incident which was shared widely across social
  media, Giuliani said: “I tripped as I was checking out the convention floor.
  The eyes of the world are on Fiserv Forum and the RNC, so my trip was seen by
  many. As a famous person once said: ‘Our greatest glory is not in never
  falling, but in rising every time we fall.’” Giuliani served as New York
  City’s mayor from 1994 to 2001. He later went on to serve as Donald Trump’s
  lawyer before being disbarred in Washington DC and New York over false
  statements he made about the 2020 presidential election. In 2023, a jury
  ordered Giuliani to pay $148.1m to two former election workers from Georgia
  after he falsely accused them of attempting to steal the 2020 presidential
  election in Georgia.
