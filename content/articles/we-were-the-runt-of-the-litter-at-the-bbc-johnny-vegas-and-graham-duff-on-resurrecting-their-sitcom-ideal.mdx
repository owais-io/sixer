  Drugs, gangs, kidnappings, police corruption, murder, even necrophilia. While
  this might sound like the stuff of a grisly crime drama, in reality it’s the
  backdrop to the strange and surreal BBC sitcom Ideal. A black comedy centred
  on a low-level weed dealer, Moz (played by Johnny Vegas), the show has become
  a beloved cult classic since its original run from 2005 to 2011. After years
  spent lingering in the digital abyss, episodes were finally uploaded to
  iPlayer last year and now, 20 years since it first aired, the show is
  returning for a live stage production. “I didn’t appreciate how original it
  was when we were making it,” says Vegas, sitting in the restaurant of a plush
  five-star hotel in Manchester, a far cry from the rodent-infested flat he
  spent years in as Moz. “You only appreciate it years later, when folks are
  coming up going: ‘That was the one show that spoke to me – that was my life.’”
  As a genuinely inventive and countercultural word-of-mouth hit, the show
  picked up obsessive followers; there’s a dedicated Facebook group where fans
  share quotes, memes and clips; people gush about it on Reddit threads and have
  made Spotify playlists to recreate its soundtrack. When its stage return was
  announced, several shows sold out instantly. “There was no guarantee there’d
  be an audience for Ideal in 2025,” says creator and writer Graham Duff, who
  also plays Brian, a hilariously snippy and flamboyant gay man with an infinite
  number of men on his arm. “But the response has been wonderful. The phrase we
  keep hearing is: ‘Why has it taken so long?’” There is a feeling of unfinished
  business. The show was cancelled abruptly, leaving Ideal without a neat
  wrap-up. “Every series, I wrote the final episode thinking this could be the
  last one,” says Duff. “The only time I didn’t do that was [the final] series
  seven. By that stage, the viewing figures were so good, and we had Kiefer
  Sutherland saying he was going to appear in the next series. I thought: now I
  can stop looking over my shoulder. So it felt really brutal. We had a lot more
  to say.” The TV show featured Moz, his girlfriends, bent coppers, a gangster
  called Psycho Paul, a hitman called Cartoon Head (a silent character who never
  removed their cartoon mouse mask), some utterly bizarre neighbours, and
  everyone from kids and schoolteachers and DJs all swinging by to skin up and
  buy cannabis. It also featured a spectacular list of guest stars. Julia Davis
  played a partly blind clairvoyant who claims she foresaw 9/11 in a Cup-a-Soup.
  Sean Lock was a transgender love interest of Brian’s son (a plotline that also
  involves some accidental incest). Paul Weller popped up as himself, and they
  even managed to cast Mark E Smith, late frontman of the post-punk band the
  Fall, as Jesus Christ. “There’s only one person who ever turned us down,” says
  Duff, “and that was Kate Moss. Everybody else couldn’t say yes quick enough
  but her agent said she wouldn’t do anything related to drugs.” “It was a show
  that, against the odds, kept going,” adds Vegas. “It was almost unwanted – we
  were the runt of the litter at BBC Three.” The BBC, he says, “didn’t know what
  to do with it”. There was talk of a film to be directed by Ben Wheatley, who
  did series five and six of the show, but it never materialised. Then in 2021,
  Vegas saw the live stage show of another beloved and arguably overlooked BBC
  show, Early Doors. It triggered an idea: “I thought: That’s a beautiful way to
  get around the system,” he says. The live show will pick up 20 years later
  with Moz, unsurprisingly, still a dealer in his and Cartoon Head’s flat. “The
  story is partly a murder mystery,” explains Duff, who is keen to keep details
  to a minimum, “with each of Moz’s regular customers under suspicion. Moz also
  has a new girlfriend, Liza, and my character now has an OnlyFans – because, of
  course he has.” In the original TV show, Duff created a world that was vast
  but also intensely claustrophobic. There’s only one scene out of 53 episodes
  that ventures outside: everything else is shot in Moz’s or his neighbours’
  flats, with an ever-rotating cast of oddballs. “At the time I was thinking: I
  reckon at least a quarter of the country smokes weed and will have been to a
  dealer,” says Duff. “But how often do you see it on TV? I thought there’s
  something in that: it’s a locus for all these people to cross and interact.”
  As such, the show isn’t really about drugs, nor was it ever intended to be.
  “I’ve always hated things like Cheech and Chong, where it’s like: Oh, I was so
  out of it I did this crazy thing,” says Duff. “I’ve got zero interest in that.
  It’s no more about drugs than Only Fools and Horses is about stolen goods.
  It’s about those characters and their interactions, dynamics, aspirations and
  disappointments.” The pair clearly love talking about the show. Vegas sips a
  vodka soda, Duff a cranberry juice, and in the deserted restaurant hall this
  afternoon, their frequent howls of laughter echo through the room. Vegas
  recalls the “spliff-making bootcamp” he had to go on before the first series,
  because he wasn’t much of a cannabis smoker himself. “I couldn’t get creative
  by smoking weed,” he says. “It just made me play [PlayStation game] Toca
  Racing and eat loads of toast.” He also recalls the time he and the cast had
  been out the night before and came in on two hours’ sleep, a bit too wobbly. A
  producer deemed him unfit for work, and he was told to go and lie down. “We
  had the best time,” says Vegas. “We worked hard, we played hard, but we
  delivered. I was gifted a character that always looked worse for wear.”
  However, such shenanigans were limited to series one. “By the second series,
  we all realised we were doing something that had some gravity to it,” says
  Duff. “We needed to protect it.” Vegas’s performance is some of his best work.
  Spending 53 episodes with a permanently stoned, adulterous work-shy drug
  dealer, confined largely to his living room, only works because Vegas is able
  to show him as funny, vulnerable, occasionally tender, and likable, as well as
  a bit of a dope. “It might be the closest thing I have given to a nuanced
  performance,” Vegas says, with typical self-deprecation. But this time, it’s
  perhaps Vegas’s onstage experience that Duff will be tapping into for Ideal’s
  stage reboot. “There are all kinds of onscreen elements that just aren’t
  possible on stage,” he says. “But there are things that live performance gives
  you, which are so special. Several of the cast work as standup comics [Emma
  Fryer, Joanna Neary and Ben Crompton are all confirmed] so they know a thing
  or two about live comedy timing. Plus, seeing the action play out in real time
  really elevates the suspense – and there’s a lot of suspense in this play.”
  However, one thing they are clear to point out is that this is not going to be
  some greatest hits rehash. “I’m aware of what it means to fans and I don’t
  want to trample on that,” says Duff. “But it can’t just be a celebration. I
  want somebody who’s never seen Ideal on TV to be able to watch it and be
  gripped. I’m not interested in nostalgia and ‘Oh, do you remember that thing
  from back then? Yeah, we brought it back, and it’s almost as good as it used
  to be.’ Fuck that. It’s got to be bulletproof and enjoyable in its own right.
  I just hope people think we’ve done Ideal justice.” Vegas nods along, taking a
  sip of his drink, before adding: “And, if it’s shit, it’s all Graham’s fault.”
  Ideal tours from 8 September to 11 October; tour starts Salford.
