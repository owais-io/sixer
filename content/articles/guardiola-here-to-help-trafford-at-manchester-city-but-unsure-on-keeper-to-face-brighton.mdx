  Pep Guardiola says James Trafford needed comforting after his mistake against
  Tottenham last week and that he has yet to decide whether the Manchester City
  goalkeeper will keep his place against Brighton on Sunday. Trafford was at
  fault for the second goal in the defeat by Tottenham and has been heavily
  criticised, leaving Guardiola to ponder a recall for Ederson, who was on the
  bench. The Brazilian has consistently been Guardiola’s No 1 but missed the
  opening-day win over Wolves before being named as a substitute against
  Tottenham. A final decision will be made on selection on Saturday, Guardiola
  said. “Always have arms around the shoulder, always,” the manager said. “We
  take care of them. What happened didn’t belong just to James, what happened in
  the second goal against Spurs. He’s a huge personality. He’s concerned – I
  wouldn’t like it if he wasn’t – but we’re here to help him. We’re here to
  support them.” Asked who will be No 1 in the long term, Guardiola said: “All
  the clubs, before the international transfer window is closed, everything is
  possible. It’s as simple as that. After that, we’re going to play [Manchester]
  United and Champions League and Arsenal. After everything will be more clear
  and now we take a decision. It depends on the performance and it depends on
  many reasons.” After the trip to Brighton, the majority of City’s players will
  disperse for international duty before returning for the game at home to
  United on 14 September. It will be the start of a busy period for City, whose
  Champions League fixtures include a game at Real Madrid and visits from Napoli
  and Galatasaray, bringing returns to the club for Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy
  Sané. “I will have the honour to be the manager of more games played in
  Bernabéu,” Guardiola said. “So, yeah, nice to be in Spain again. Kevin and
  Leroy, I’m really pleased they came back here and of course we have to beat
  the two teams like Napoli, Galatasaray, but it’s nice to bring him back and
  I’m pretty sure that we have a great welcome to them because they deserve it.”
