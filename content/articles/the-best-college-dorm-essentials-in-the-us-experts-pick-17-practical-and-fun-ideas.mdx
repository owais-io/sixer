  Prepping for college doesn’t mean you have to opt for disposable junk destined
  to end the semester in plastic shards. And as Ilana Drake, a recent graduate
  of Vanderbilt University who lived on campus for four years, advises, it is
  better to move in with fewer items. “A lot of people get inspiration from
  social media or have a Pinterest board [of college dorm decor], but you don’t
  need everything,” she says. “People tend to overpack for college.” Whether you
  or someone you know is university-bound, I’ve curated a list of the most
  helpful (and sometimes overlooked) essentials that are high-quality enough to
  bring back every academic year, whatever your budget. These suggestions are
  rooted in experience. I have served as a longtime mentor for young people who
  are about college-going age, so I asked more than a dozen current students,
  recent graduates and their relatives to recommend their favorite dorm picks.
  Read on for our choices by category, as well as what you don’t need. But
  first: the top three items that kept coming up over and over again. All prices
  current at the time of publication. The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

  earbuds $89.00 at Amazon $89.00 at Nothing Carlos Lerma, a Columbia College
  student, swears by noise-cancelling headphones. “Dorm walls are thiiiiiiin,
  and things can get chaotic fast if your roommate has friends over, plays video
  games late into the night, or if music is blasting from down the hall,” writes
  Carlos. “I go to a film school, and there was a short film being shot in my
  building … at 3am. Having headphones on standby was clutch. Total lifesaver.”
  The Guardian reviewed these Nothing earbuds and reports they “offer great
  sound and noise cancelling for an even more competitive price”. Sleepyhead gel
  memory foam topper with CoolTech classic cover $249.00 at Amazon $299.00 at
  SleepyHead “Dorm beds are so comfortable,” said no one ever. Across the board,
  students sang the praises of a mattress topper, and Sleepyhead is a popular,
  college-student-founded brand committed to the climate-friendly production of
  gel mattress toppers. “Oftentimes the mattresses that are provided in the
  dorms are hard, so a topper just gives you an extra cushion for comfort”, says
  Olivia Shen, a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Baggu
  small cosmetic case (for building a first-aid kit) $38.00 at Baggu Illness
  spreads like wildfire at a college dorm building – so nearly every source has
  suggested bringing a first-aid kit. For building your own, I suggest a Baggu
  cosmetic case and filling it with what you need. A Baggu can be easily
  repurposed and is made of recycled plastic. “When your child is away and gets
  sick for the first time, you’ll know the call – it starts with a panicked
  ‘Mommmmyyy’. I’ve been there,” says Nita Talwar, a mom of two recent college
  graduates. “We stocked our kits with NyQuil, Emergen-C, headache and allergy
  meds, Band-Aids, and Uppy electrolyte drink mix.” ••• Bedding and bedside
  accessories Cotton sheets from Boll &amp; Branch or The Company Store $638 at
  Boll &amp; Branch $75.20 at The Company Store For when not pulling an
  all-nighter, a good set of bedsheets will be appreciated. Deborah J Cohan, a
  professor at the University of South Carolina Beaufort and the author of The
  Complete U, a college success guide, has these Boll &amp; Branch sheets – and
  recommends the twin XL bundle for incoming students. (It comes with a
  comforter, sham, flat sheet, fitted sheet and a pillowcase. All are made of
  100% organic cotton.) While pricey, “these sheets are like a warm hug that
  will lull you into your best sleep,” she says. If you’re looking to spend less
  than $100, the twin XL organic cotton percale sheet set from The Company Store
  is a solid bet, and it comes with a flat sheet, fitted sheet and pillowcase.
  Modern Innovations bedside shelf $17.99 at Amazon $26.99 at Walmart Dorm beds
  – especially if it’s lofted or in a shared space – are not exactly set up for
  nightstands. Maggie Morris, a West Kentucky University student, has found a
  cheeky solution: “This bedside tray is like a loyal sidekick that holds your
  phone, water bottle and midnight snacks, and it doesn’t judge your 2am
  scrolling habits! It clips right to your dorm bed like it was born to be
  there. It makes my life so much more organized and easier while living in a
  dorm!” ••• Desk Pottery Barn Teen dry-erase calendar $129 at PB Teen Time
  management: it’s a challenge for many of us, and not least college students on
  their own for the first time. “Years ago, the mother of a Smith first-year
  hired me to be her daughter’s time management coach because she had missed
  multiple assignments,” says Dominique Padurano, a college counselor and
  adjunct professor at State University of New York. Padurano’s solution for the
  student? A dry-erase board as “a daily visual reminder of when things were
  due, so you don’t slip into the digital morass of your phone calendar”. •••
  Technology Belkin 12-outlet surge protector $27.99 at Best Buy $27.99 at
  Amazon “We got my sister a portable charger and a plug extender because dorm
  outlets are never where you need them,” says Joanna Gołacka, who moved her
  sibling into a Boston school recently. This model has 12 outlets and an 8ft
  (2.4-meter) cord. Surge protectors are an extra level of protector for your
  electronics and may be required by the college. JBL Clip 5 portable waterproof
  bluetooth speaker $49.99 at Walmart $59.95 at JBL Despite its compact size,
  this portable speaker from JBL is powerful. This particular style is made from
  90% recycled polycarbonate and is certified waterproof and dustproof, perfect
  for blasting tunes in the shower or to take with you outdoors. “Music is such
  a good way to bring people together, and having a speaker I could carry
  anywhere was a total gamechanger,” says Ella Cason, a student at Northeastern
  University. “From getting ready for a night out with my roommate to laying out
  on the quad with friends, it allows me to connect with the people around me.
  It’s one of my favorite freshman-year purchases.” ••• Room and decor BN-Link
  dimmable floor lamp $32.99 at Walmart Dorm room lighting can be vibeless, so
  Tracy Roy, a mother of a Roanoke College student, recommends a dimmable floor
  lamp – with a small base to fit in tight spaces. “It makes the room so much
  homier since the overhead is usually terrible. My son was so upset when his
  plug broke and he was without it for a couple weeks,” she says. Woozoo
  five-speed fan $49.99 at Costco $64.95 at Amazon What no one tells you about
  dorm life is how difficult it is to thermoregulate, which is why Woozoo has
  become a cult favorite product. It’s sleek, compact, has multi-oscillation and
  speed options, and can generate airflow up to 82ft. “Be sure you get the
  five-speed model for maximum air circulation and cooling,” says Lara Becker, a
  mom of two college students and founder of The Dorm Guide. “Fun fact: moms who
  try out the fan to see what all of the hype is about tend to pick up one up
  for themselves – it’s just as useful for midlife temperature swings as it is
  for hot dorm rooms.” ••• Cleaning and organization Pottery Barn Teen recycled
  laundry backpack $49.50 at Pottery Barn While there are many laundry hampers
  and bags to choose from, Doreen Nunez, a mom of a student heading to Denison
  University this fall, recommends one with backpack straps since it’s “easier
  than juggling a bulky basket”, she says, especially if getting to the laundry
  room is a hike. This one also happens to be made from 100% recycled polyester
  from water bottles. As for detergents, these Blueland tablets are
  plastic-free, easier to lug than liquid jugs, and less messy. The Container
  Store three-tier rolling cart $39.99 at The Container Store A rolling cart is
  a quiet MVP when it comes to organization, and it’s never too late to acquire
  one. “I only got it as a senior, but it was a great way to access my reading
  materials next to my bed before I went to sleep,” says Drake, the recent
  Vanderbilt graduate. Of course, the sky is the limit – you can also store
  snacks, toiletries, utensils and more. 3M Command large utility hooks and
  adhesive strips $8.88 at Target $8.88 at Walmart It has to be said: bare walls
  are depressing. That’s where Command adhesive products come in. These sticky
  strips can hang posters and framed art, and the hooks can handle jackets and
  coats (up to 5lb) – all without damaging the walls. When it’s time to remove
  them, all you do is pull the strip tab downward until it peels itself off.
  “Command strips are absolutely essential for my college-bound son. We can send
  him to school with bits of home to hang on his walls without risking a
  security deposit,” says Nunez, the mom of the future Denison student. (For the
  small stuff, Scotch wall-safe tape will do the trick.) ••• Bath and shower
  Okabashi Maui women’s flip-flop sandals $29.99 at Okabashi, multiple styles
  “College showers can get messy so you’ll want to keep your feet and personal
  items clean with sandals and a caddy,” says Luca Persistent, a Middlebury
  College graduate and education consultant. While any waterproof sandal will
  work as shower shoes, I particularly love Okabashi for its commitment to
  zero-waste manufacturing at its Georgia factory. You can even send back
  worn-out Okabashi shoes to be recycled and then receive 15% off your next
  pair. Pottery Barn Teen recycled shower caddy $29 at Pottery Barn The options
  for great caddies are limited – metals get rusty, bamboo can get moldy, and
  plastic ones … are yet more plastic in the world. This alternative from
  Pottery Barn is made from recycled water bottles. The material is quick-dry
  and if anything’s looking funky, a quick rinse in cold water will do the
  trick. ••• Tools 15-piece tool set $15.99 at Ikea “I fought with my mom on a
  tool set for a while because I never thought I’d need them, but she was
  right,” admits Kyle McCartney, an Arizona State University graduate. “Not only
  did I use these tools a ton, but everyone on my floor did too, especially
  after realizing the furniture they bought had to be put together.” Kitchen and
  food Glasslock oven-safe food containers $20.50 at Walmart College schedules
  can be wildly unpredictable, which is why reusable glass food containers are a
  must for busy students. “These changed the meal prep game for me. I always had
  a fresh meal in the fridge, which took one thing off my plate on days when I
  was stressed about exams or projects, or just didn’t want to cook,” says
  Gabrielle Finora, a 2024 Cornell University graduate who is now a health and
  wellness coach. “I would opt for glass lids instead of a natural fiber like
  bamboo or cork to protect against mold growth.” ••• Q&amp;A What do you not
  need? Avoid fire hazards (butane stoves, candles, incenses, halogen lights,
  etc). Space heaters may be banned for this reason – check with the college.
  Also confirm if any cooking appliances are allowed. They might be superfluous
  anyway if there is a communal kitchen, or if the college provides mini fridges
  and microwaves. What if you’re traveling by plane? Cody Kirkpatrick, a student
  affairs professional at a New York-based college, recommends packing
  everything you can in suitcases and shipping one or two boxes filled with the
  rest of your essentials. “Then once you get there, see how much space you
  actually have. Buy additional items locally, online or send a list to your
  parents of items to ship you from home,” he says. “I see out-of-state students
  ship their entire bedroom in boxes and once they move in, they realize they
  only have space for 10% of what they shipped.” Are there other ways to get
  these kinds of items? Some residence halls now offer sustainable initiatives –
  but it varies from school to school. “There might be a donation drive at the
  end of the previous academic year where these sustainability offices collect
  reusable dorm items that students are getting rid of like lamps, rugs,
  kitchenware, cleaning products, etc,” Kirkpatrick says. “Just remember to pay
  it forward when it’s time for you to move out.” And don’t forget: you can
  split the costs and responsibilities. If the room is a double, triple or quad,
  have a discussion with the roommates so you can divide and conquer the
  communal items. ••• Jinnie Lee is a New York-based culture and shopping writer
  who specializes in fashion, lifestyle and home. She has made product
