  Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the
  war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently
  returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday. The North Korean
  leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting
  spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia’s Kursk region
  from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the
  state news agency KCNA said. “The combat activities of overseas operational
  forces … proved without regret the power of the heroic [North Korean] army,”
  Kim said. Kim laid a flower at a memorial for North Korean soldiers who had
  died overseas, while soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with
  a concert, KCNA said, adding that relatives of troops killed in action had
  been among those attending a banquet. The events were the latest public show
  of gratitude by the regime in Pyongyang, in stark contrast to the secrecy that
  surrounded North Korea’s role in the war when its troops were first sent to
  Russia last autumn. Kim met officers of the army’s overseas operation and paid
  tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been
  assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant
  encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said. The ceremony comes
  days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, used similar language to pay
  tribute to North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russian forces. In a
  letter to Kim to mark the anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japanese
  colonial rule in August 1945, Putin described North Korean troops as “heroic”
  and recalled how Soviet units and North Korean forces had also fought together
  to end Japan’s occupation of the Korean peninsula. “The bonds of militant
  friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the
  war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,” Putin said. Russia and
  North Korea forged increasingly close military and diplomatic ties, triggering
  international concern that the North’s troops are acquiring valuable combat
  experience that could one day be used against the country’s neighbour, South
  Korea. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and in April this
  year, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed a
  contingent of soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian
  troops. Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia’s Kursk region in
  2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with
  artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems. About 600 North
  Korean troops have been killed out of a total deployment of 15,000, South
  Korean lawmakers said in April, citing the South’s intelligence agency. This
  week’s official tributes appeared to be intended to “justify the deployment
  and boost morale”, the South’s Yonhap news agency quoted a unification
  ministry official as saying. With Reuters
