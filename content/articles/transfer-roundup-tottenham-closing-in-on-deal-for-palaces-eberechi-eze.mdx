  Tottenham are closing in on the signing of Eberechi Eze as Crystal Palace
  prepare to face Chelsea in their opening game on Sunday. Spurs, who are
  looking for attacking reinforcements after losing James Maddison to a serious
  knee injury and missing out on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White, have
  held positive talks over a deal for the playmaker and it is understood that an
  agreement is close. Eze’s release clause of £67.5m expired on Friday and there
  are indications that the 27-year-old may end up costing around £55m plus
  add-ons. There is a chance that negotiations will conclude with the initial
  fee for the England international falling under £55m. Palace are looking for a
  sizeable chunk of the guaranteed portion of the deal paid up front if they are
  to sell the player who scored the winning goal in last season’s FA Cup final.
  Oliver Glasner’s side have identified Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss as a
  potential replacement for Eze. QPR are understood to be due a sell-on clause
  of 15% of any profit made on any transfer after Palace signed Eze for £19.5m
  in 2020. Arsenal have also been in the hunt for Eze, who has developed into
  one of the most exciting attackers in the Premier League during his time at
  Selhurst Park, but they have dithered over a move. Mikel Arteta has options in
  attacking midfield and Arsenal have been keen to sell fringe players before
  making a bid. Spurs are looking to add creativity to Thomas Frank’s squad and
  can offer Eze Champions League football. The former QPR player is keen on the
  move, with personal terms not expected to be a problem. Palace are also at
  risk of losing Marc Guéhi. Liverpool have held talks over the England
  defender, who has no intention of extending his contract before it expires
  next year. Glasner said on Friday that he expected Eze and Guéhi to feature
  against Chelsea. “Marc has trained the entire week with us, every single
  training session, the same with Ebs,” he said. “They’ve prepared the best way
  for the Chelsea game on Sunday afternoon. I’ve been in the football business
  for too long, so I know that at any time of any day, things can happen. If you
  ask me now, I expect both Marc and Ebs to start on Sunday. Nottingham Forest
  have confirmed the £37m club-record arrival of Omari Hutchinson from Ipswich
  on a five-year contract. Hutchinson has been joined at the City Ground by his
  England Under-21s teammate James McAtee from Manchester City, who has cost
  £30m. The 21-year-old Hutchinson said: “I’m really excited to be here and
  can’t wait to get started. I’ve played at the City Ground a few times and it’s
  always felt like a hostile atmosphere. It’s a new chapter for me but I feel
  ready.” This week Nuno Espírito Santo, whose side host Brentford on Sunday,
  expressed concerns his squad was not ready to cope with playing in four
  competitions after qualifying for the Europa League when Crystal Palace were
  demoted to the Conference League. Brentford have signed Dango Ouattara from
  Bournemouth for a club record £42.5m. The south coast club posted on social
  media: “We can confirm winger Dango Ouattara has completed a permanent
  transfer to Brentford. AFC Bournemouth would like to extend its thanks to
  Dango for his contributions on the pitch while with the club.”
