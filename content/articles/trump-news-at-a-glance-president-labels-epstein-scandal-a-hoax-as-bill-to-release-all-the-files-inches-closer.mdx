  Donald Trump has labelled the continuing Epstein scandal a “Democrat hoax” and
  told reporters “I think it’s enough”, a day after his administration released
  more documents as part of the investigation, the majority of which contained
  information that was already public. The president said on Wednesday that
  “thousands and thousands of documents” had been released but “no matter what
  you do it’s going to keep going.” Democrats and some Republicans in Congress
  have pushed for more transparency on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein,
  and Trump’s comments came as some victims of the deceased financier held a
  news conference on Capitol Hill. Here’s the day’s Trump administration news at
  a glance. Epstein abuse survivors urge lawmakers to release all files Several
  survivors of Epstein’s abuse signaled their support for a bipartisan
  resolution to release all the files related to the convicted sex offender.
  Speaking outside the US Capitol, Anouska De Georgiou, a survivor of both
  Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, said that while “every day
  of this journey toward healing has come at a profound cost to my mental
  health,” she chose to be there because this legislation “really matters”. The
  only motive to oppose the bill would only be to “conceal wrongdoing”, she
  added, but also issued a plea to Donald Trump to use his power and influence
  to help release the full tranche of records on Epstein. Read the full story
  Release of Epstein video contradicts Bondi claim A so-called “missing minute”
  of CCTV footage, a key ingredient of conspiracy theories surrounding the
  prison death of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has been found,
  contradicting the assertion of Pam Bondi, the attorney general, that it was
  recorded over. Read the full story Florida to end vaccine mandates for
  children as state’s surgeon general likens them to ‘slavery’ Children in
  Florida will no longer be required to receive vaccines against preventable
  diseases including measles, mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis, said
  Joseph Ladapo, the state’s surgeon general, on Wednesday in a speech during
  which he likened vaccine mandates to “slavery”. Read the full story Block of
  Trump’s use of Alien Enemies Act hailed a ‘victory’ A court ruling that
  blocked Donald Trump from invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans
  he alleged were part of a criminal gang has been hailed as “a victory for the
  rule of law”. In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel of the 5th US circuit
  court of appeals issued a preliminary injunction that prevents the Trump
  administration using the 1798 law to justify rapid deportations. Read the full
  story 1,000 health workers urge RFK Jr to quit A letter published by more than
  1,000 past and present workers of the health and human services department has
  demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr, insisting the health
  secretary’s attacks on vaccines endangered the lives of all Americans. The
  hard-hitting letter, addressed to Congress members, blames Kennedy for turmoil
  at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of the
  agency’s chief and replacement by a Donald Trump loyalist with no medical or
  scientific background. Read the full story Trump pledges to ‘stand with
  Warsaw’ The US president, Donald Trump, has said he was not considering
  pulling US troops out of Poland and pledged to stand with Warsaw “all the way”
  during a meeting with the country’s conservative nationalist president, Karol
  Nawrocki, at the White House. Read the full story Democrats blast state
  department for lack of ‘basic oversight’ of controversial Gaza food
  organization Senior Democratic senators have called on the US secretary of
  state, Marco Rubio, and the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, to reveal
  details behind the financing and oversight of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation
  (GHF) amid concerns over rising death tolls near aid sites, the group’s
  apparent coordination with the Israeli army and its reported use of private
  military contractors linked to intelligence operations. Read the full story
  What else happened today: Washington DC’s mayor bowed to Trump’s military
  occupation of the nation’s capital by signing an executive order that
  formalizes cooperation with federal forces. The governors of California,
  Oregon and Washington announced the creation of a West Coast Health Alliance
  aimed at safeguarding access to vaccines. Eric Adams, the embattled mayor of
  New York, has denied having conversations with Donald Trump about being given
  a government job in exchange for dropping his re-election campaign. House
  Republicans have voted to establish a new subcommittee to reinvestigate the
  January 6 attack, a move that comes as Donald Trump has tried to rewrite the
  history of the most violent incident in US Capitol history. Catching up?
