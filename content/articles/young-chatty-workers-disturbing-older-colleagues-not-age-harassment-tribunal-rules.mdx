  Older employees who are disturbed by younger, more boisterous colleagues in
  the workplace are not victims of age harassment, an employment tribunal has
  ruled. Employees in their 20s and 30s may annoy more mature co-workers by
  chatting, socialising and looking at their phones but they are not breaking
  workplace equality rules, the tribunal said. The ruling came in the case of
  Catherine Ritchie, an administrator in her late 60s who took her bosses to an
  employment tribunal for grievances including the noisy fun her younger
  co-workers were having while she was trying to get on with her job. Ritchie
  said she found it difficult to watch “extreme time wasting and low
  productivity” from “noisy and boisterous” younger colleagues and was left with
  a pounding headache and a hoarse voice from having to talk loudly to make
  herself heard. The tribunal in Watford, Hertfordshire, heard that Ritchie was
  66 when she began working for an electrical engineering company and was the
  oldest person there. In its summary of the case, the tribunal said Ritchie
  found the office a very noisy environment and that this was distracting when
  she was trying to make calls. It said: “She indicated that she found it
  unprofessional of colleagues to engage in personal conversations in the
  office, when they ought to be working. She referred to the fact that they were
  not paid to socialise and that she had difficulty in watching such time
  wasting and low productivity.” She felt she was not respected when she asked
  for quiet and asked a manager if she could work from home but this was not
  allowed. Ritchie was told by one manager that she should concentrate on
  reaching her targets and not concern herself with what was going on around
  her. The tribunal said what she experienced did not amount to harassment. It
  concluded: “The tribunal accepted that the claimant took her work seriously
  and wished to remain professional at all times, but they considered that her
  projection of this standard to all those with whom she worked was not
  reasonable and resulted in her having unreasonable feelings of indignation
  about their behaviour when she did not have justifiable reason to do so. “The
  tribunal considered that the claimant’s perception of the noisy and disruptive
  behaviour as amounting to harassment was not reasonable.”
