  The men’s second seed, Carlos Alcaraz, continued to rebuild his momentum and
  rhythm after a brief summer break by defeating the talented young Serbian
  Hamad Medjedovic 6-4, 6-4 to reach the fourth round of the Cincinnati Open.
  The victory was a positive step for Alcaraz after a rusty performance in his
  opener against Damir Dzumhur on Sunday, where he won a turbulent three-set
  contest in his first match since losing the Wimbledon final against Jannik
  Sinner. Instead of immediately focusing on the North American hard court
  swing, with the Canadian Open in Toronto starting two weeks after Wimbledon,
  Alcaraz had a break. He took a week off from practice and holidayed in El
  Puerto de Santa Maria, in southern Spain, before two weeks’ training at home
  in El Palmar, Murcia. “When I’m off, I’m off,” he said. “I don’t step in the
  gym at all. A lot of times if we go for a trip, sometimes my friends go to the
  gym. The first week that I had off I just told them: ‘I’m gonna join you for a
  little run.’ But then I woke up and I said: ‘Go, and I’m going to keep
  sleeping.’” Medjedovic presented a genuine challenge for Alcaraz. A winner at
  the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2023, two years after Alcaraz’s victory there, the
  22-year-old is armed with a big serve and an enormous forehand. However, his
  footwork, conditioning and intensity are all lacking at the highest level.
  With the exception of a brief blip in the second set, where he momentarily
  lost his serve, Alcaraz played a solid match and he continually exposed
  Medjedovic’s movement as he marched into the fourth round. “I know he’s a
  really powerful player,” Alcaraz said after his 50th victory of the year,
  which gives him four consecutive seasons with 50-plus wins. That has not
  happened on the ATP Tour since Novak Djokovic accomplished the feat between
  2013 and 2016. “His shots are incredibly hard to return. He has a big serve
  also. I know he doesn’t like to run too much from side to side, so my plan was
  to make him run as much as I could. “It was difficult because his ball flies
  and it comes really fast, but I’m just glad that I did it most of the time,
  tried to defend in a good way. I’m just really happy to get the win.” Alcaraz
  will next face Luca Nardi, a lucky loser, after the 16th seed, Jakub Mensik,
  became the latest player to suffer in the heat, retiring from his third-round
  match against Nardi when trailing 6-2, 2-1. In the women’s draw Coco Gauff
  advanced to the fourth round after a walkover against Dayana Yastremska, the
  32nd seed, who withdrew on Tuesday due to illness.
