  From Cardiff, Wales Recommended if you like Lambrini Girls, Amyl and the
  Sniffers, Kleenex/Lilliput Up next Playing Beautiful Days festival, Fairmile,
  Devon, 14 August and touring the UK in October Across seven years, cheekily
  raucous quartet Panic Shack have gone from the Cardiff underground to the
  fringes of the mainstream. After forming as a raised middle finger to snooty
  blokey indie bands “fiddling with their pedals with a face like a slapped
  arse”, their self-titled debut crashed into the Top 40 last month and topped
  the UK rock and metal albums chart. With inspirations ranging from the Clash,
  Bikini Kill and Amy Winehouse to the Slits’ guitarist Viv Albertine’s
  autobiography, Panic Shack are a fizzy, riffy, irreverently hilarious bundle
  of buzzsaw guitars, vim and vinegar. Crucially, they sound like they are
  having a ton of fun, surely the point of starting a band in the first place.
  Onstage, they have comically exaggerated poses and even their own dance, which
  went viral on TikTok. Girl Band Starter Pack – imagine Wet Leg’s Chaise Longue
  on pint-can energy drinks – describes a typical night out with rowdy
  enthusiasm: “I finish work, I text the girls / Let’s get a bevvy, four double
  voddys … we get silly, we get loud!” Other songs cover the media obsession
  with body image (Gok Wan, which sarcastically asks “If my stomach is flat and
  my arse is perky, maybe I could get everybody to like me”), sexual harassment
  (Smellarat) and their own friendship (Thelma and Louise). Latest single
  Pockets gleefully encapsulates their celebratory irreverence. It’s about, but
  of course, the usefulness of a bag when wearing a dress with no pockets, in
  which to put “Vape / phone / keys / lip gloss!” Dave Simpson This week’s best
  new tracks Big Thief – Grandmother (ft Laraaji) Their best song yet? The US
  folk-rockers see off fatalism with the power of love and rock’n’roll, their
  cosmic guest Laraaji adding wordless exultance. Truly life-affirming. Creeper
  – Blood Magick (It’s a Ritual) Imagine Ghost covering Heaven Is a Place on
  Earth and you’re pretty much there with this gigantically silly new single
  from the UK goth troupe, recounting sexy Satanic shenanigans. Casey Dienel –
  Your Girl’s Upstairs Formerly goth-popper White Hinterland, Dienel has amassed
  a crack band for their return, with Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy bringing
  rough-grade guitar to a breezy alt-rock song about restless desire. Sophia
  Stel – All My Friends Are Models Shoegaze meets synthpop in a kind of lo-fi
  slacker version of Maggie Rogers’ widescreen earnestness, complete with a
  gorgeous chorus of pure yearning poignancy. Anysia Kym &amp; Tony Seltzer –
  Speedrun Two open-minded NYC producers surfing around the outskirts of rap
  join forces, with Kym – whose albums Truest and Soliloquy we love – adding a
  vocal earworm to this junglist miniature. Algernon Cadwallader – Hawk The name
  suggests an Edwardian steampunk detective but it’s actually a midwest emo
  band, back with their first album in 14 years. The first single is a triumph,
  looking back on a late friend with fondness and pain. Reuben Aziz – City Girls
  The British rap/R&amp;B vocalist is puppy-loved-up, swooning over his
  one-in-a-million girl with the kind of gentle melody and tenderness that Drake
  reaches for when he’s in seduction mode. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Subscribe to the
