  The Veil of the Temple – powerful expressive talents on display in eight-hour
  choral epic

  The annual new year concert of Handel’s three-hour Messiah is, for some, an
  endurance test that requires a sustaining picnic-hamper, so it was bold of the
  director of the Edinburgh international festival, Nicola Benedetti, to open
  this year’s programme with the full eight-hour version of John Tavener’s
  choral epic The Veil of the Temple, performed just once in its entirety since
  it was written a little over two decades ago. The hero of those hours was
  Swedish conductor Sofi Jeannin, best known in the UK for her work with the BBC
  Singers, and here marshalling the combined forces of the Monteverdi Choir,
  National Youth Choir of Scotland, and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus, which has
  a packed diary for its 60th anniversary year. Jeannin put in a remarkable
  shift, staying on top of every detail of the spare instrumental score as well
  as building the remarkable edifice that the combined choirs eventually become.
  The Usher Hall organ, Indian harmonium, Tibetan temple horn and percussionists
  from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra were fellow travellers on that
  journey, the latter joined by horn, brass and timpani colleagues for the
  work’s climactic eighth cycle. Those sections recycle the same textual
  material so that a work that initially seemed fragmentary made compelling, if
  relentless, sense by the time the audience reached the first 10-minute
  snack-and-comfort break after a couple of hours. Each cycle began with a
  promenading soprano soloist and duduk eastern reed instrument obbligato, the
  most appealing choral music set The Lord’s Prayer, adding a line or two of
  text to each succeeding incarnation and most melodically expressed in English,
  although alternately sung in the work’s other languages, including Greek,
  Aramaic and Sanskrit. Many of the recitatives, by contrast, were delivered on
  one note, and it was a testament to the expressive talents of soloists
  including bass-baritone Florian Störtz, delivering the Gospel words of Christ,
  and tenor Hugo Hymas, that they made those sections, often 15 minutes long, so
  powerful. For all the quality of the step-out soloists from the Monteverdi
  Choir and the Festival Chorus, it was the vocal ensemble, using the three
  choirs in different combinations, that provided the work’s highlights, and
  where the National Youth Choir of Scotland especially shone, particularly in
  the sustained high soprano singing. The first of this festival’s concerts with
  beanbag seating in the stalls, the staging by Thomas Guthrie – frontman of the
  2024 programme’s The Alehouse Sessions in the same space – used the entire
  building brilliantly for Tavener’s ritual epic.
