  Iran has rejected allegations it was behind two antisemitic arson attacks in
  Australia, and vowed “reciprocal action” against Australia for expelling its
  ambassador. A car carrying embassy officials was seen leaving the Iranian
  embassy in Canberra on Tuesday night. Iran’s ambassador – now persona non
  grata – and other diplomats have been given seven days to leave the country.
  The Iranian foreign minister called the Australian prime minister a “weak
  politician” and said Australia’s actions – which included proscribing the
  powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation – were
  an attempt to appease Israel. On Tuesday, the prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, said his government had “credible intelligence” the Iranian
  government had directed at least two arson attacks in Australia last year, on
  the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne and Lewis’s Continental Kitchen in
  Bondi in Sydney. It was “likely”, Albanese said, that Iran was responsible for
  other antisemitic attacks. Legislation to designate the IRGC as a terror group
  is likely to take some time, potentially weeks, to be finalised. Home affairs
  minister Tony Burke told Sky News the legislation was being drafted, with
  hopes to make the change “as soon as we can.” “It’s a process which is not
  possible with the current legislation,” he said. Asked on Wednesday about the
  accusation that Australia had acted to appease Israel, the foreign affairs
  minister Penny Wong said “we act in Australia’s interests”. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The Australian government believes the arson attacks were
  engineered by commanders in the IRGC, who, through a series of intermediaries
  targeted the synagogue and the kosher deli, in heavily Jewish neighbourhoods
  in Australia’s two largest cities. “These were extraordinary and dangerous
  acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,”
  Albanese said. “They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow
  discord in our community. It is totally unacceptable.” Australian diplomats
  were withdrawn from Tehran ahead of the announcement. Iran’s foreign minister,
  Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said that for Iran to attack Australia’s Jewish
  community “makes zero sense” “I am not in the habit of joining causes with
  wanted war criminals, but Netanyahu is right about one thing: Australia’s PM
  is indeed a ‘weak politician’,” Araghchi said online. “Iran is paying the
  price for the Australian people’s support for Palestine. Canberra should know
  better than to attempt to appease a regime led by war criminals. Doing so will
  only embolden Netanyahu and his ilk.” Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil
  Baqaei denied Iran was behind the attacks. “The accusation that has been made
  is absolutely rejected,” he said. “Any inappropriate and unjustified action on
  a diplomatic level will have a reciprocal reaction. Asked exactly what
  evidence Asio presented to make the assessment that Iran had directed the
  attacks, Wong declined to say in a press conference, but said the government
  had confidence in its security agencies. “We have confidence in Asio
  assessments. We have confidence in our security agencies, and we have acted on
  it, on their assessments,” she said. Asked why Australia was targeted in this
  way, Wong said Iran had engaged in foreign interference around the world.
  “What is different about this... is this is orchestration of a violent attack.
  Obviously, we will continue to investigate the these sorts of issues, the
  reasons behind as well as the other lines of inquiry,” she said. “But I would
  make this point, this is unacceptable. We have diplomatic relations with
  countries with whom we don’t agree. We do that for our interests, but to have
  a foreign country organise a violent action on Australian soil crosses a
  line.” Wong said she believed there were between 2000 and 4000 Australians
  currently in Iran. On Channel Nine, asked about Iran’s denials, Wong said the
  government “is not going to countenance a foreign regime engaging in
  activities in Australia which are not just about sowing division, they are
  that. But they are also violent acts which harm or have the potential to harm
  Australians.” Australian federal police and the Australian Security
  Intelligence Organisation (Asio) have been investigating possible foreign
  orchestration of the arson attacks for months. As long ago as January, the AFP
  commissioner, Reece Kershaw, issued a statement, saying “we are looking into
  whether overseas actors or individuals have paid local criminals in Australia
  to carry out some of these crimes”. But the announcement of the expulsion of
  the ambassador and proscribing of the IRGC comes as Australia’s relations with
  Israel reached a nadir over Canberra’s criticism of the worsening human-made
  famine in Gaza and the IDF’s prosecution of its war in the occupied territory.
  The Australian Iranian Community Alliance welcomed the Australian government’s
  move against Iran, saying the regime had built “adversarial networks” across
  Australia “to undermine social cohesion, instil fear, and conduct attacks”.
  “Let us be clear: this is not a diplomatic disagreement with a sovereign
  nation. This is a countermeasure against a transnational criminal enterprise
  that has hijacked a country, plundered its resources, destabilised a region,
  and targeted innocent lives globally – including here in Australia.” The IRGC
  has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, Canada, Sweden,
  Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, among others. with Agence France Presse
