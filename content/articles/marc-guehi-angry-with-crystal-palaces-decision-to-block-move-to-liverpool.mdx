  Marc Guéhi is extremely unhappy with Crystal Palace’s decision to pull the
  plug on his £35m transfer to Liverpool, which came after Oliver Glasner
  stepped in to prevent the move by threatening to resign if he was sold, the
  Guardian understands. The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, reluctantly accepted
  Liverpool’s offer for the England defender a few hours before Monday’s
  deadline despite Glasner having insisted the 25-year-old must not be sold
  because there was no time to find an adequate replacement. It is understood
  that despite Guéhi having completed the first part of his medical in
  expectation of his move to Anfield going through – and a deal sheet having
  been submitted before Monday’s 7pm deadline – Parish changed his mind at the
  last minute after his manager, whose own contract at Selhurst Park expires
  next summer, said he would walk out if the deal went through. Guéhi is
  believed to have been left bitterly disappointed by the U-turn, with the deal
  so far advanced that Palace had already signed off a farewell video that has
  since been leaked online and ends with the words “Thank you Skip”. A private
  jet had also been lined up to take Guéhi to Merseyside that evening. There is
  no suggestion that he will not play for Palace again, although one source
  close to Guéhi has said that he is considering whether to continue as captain.
  In stark comparison to Alexander Isak – who effectively went on strike to
  force through his move to Anfield – the former Chelsea player is said to feel
  that he acted correctly during all the transfer speculation by continuing to
  play for Palace. Other members of the squad are also believed to be upset that
  Guéhi was denied his move. Liverpool could attempt to sign Guéhi again in the
  January transfer window, although he will also be able to sign a pre-contract
  agreement for an overseas club. Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus are
  believed to have expressed an interest.
