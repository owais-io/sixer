  lipstick

  On a trip to Cairns, I met an American man while scuba diving. We spent some
  whirlwind time together and, a few months later, I decided to go to Florida to
  see him again. It was a very long flight with multiple layovers to get there,
  so when I finally got off the plane I was feeling tired and looking awful. Not
  ideal when you’re going to meet your new boyfriend! I was taking stock of my
  washed-out appearance in the airport bathroom mirror when a very glamorous
  flight attendant strolled in. She was putting on some lipstick and, not having
  remembered to pack any of my own, I bemoaned how terrible I looked and asked
  her if I could borrow some. I wouldn’t normally have asked someone for their
  lipstick, because it’s such a personal thing, but desperate times call for
  desperate measures. She went one better than just loaning me hers. Out of her
  purse she pulled a brand-new tube of lipstick and handed it to me, telling me
  I could keep it. I put it on and immediately felt much better, emboldened to
  go and meet my American beau in the pickup area. I kept her tube of lipstick
  for years, because it reminded me of that very generous gesture. I was in a
  vulnerable state, not feeling my best, and her act touched me. Things didn’t
  work out with the boyfriend – long distance is tricky – but I never forgot
  that small but impactful gift from a stranger. I think a lot of selfless acts
  probably happen in women’s bathrooms. What is the nicest thing a stranger has
  ever done for you? If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read
