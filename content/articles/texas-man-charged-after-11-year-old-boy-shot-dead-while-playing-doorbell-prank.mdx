  A 42-year-old man in Texas has been charged with murder after the fatal
  shooting of an 11-year-old boy who was playing a doorbell prank in Houston on
  Saturday night, authorities said. The shooting occurred at around 11pm on
  Saturday, according to Houston authorities, when the boy and his friends were
  in their neighborhood reportedly playing a game of “ding dong ditch” – an old
  childhood prank involving ringing a doorbell and running away. Houston police
  officials told local news site KHOU 11 that someone inside one of the homes
  came outside and opened fire, and one of the boys, who was 11 years old, “was
  shot in the back”. The boy was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was
  pronounced dead on Sunday, the police said. One person was initially detained
  for questioning at the scene and later released, police added. On Tuesday
  morning, court records show that a man named Leon Gonzalo Jr, 42, was arrested
  and charged with murder in connection with the shooting. He was booked into
  the Harris county jail early Tuesday. According to CNN, his home address
  matches the location where the fatal shooting occurred. A preliminary court
  hearing is scheduled for later Tuesday. Houston police sergeant Michael Cass
  told KHOU that the shooting did not appear to be in self-defense, noting that
  the shooting “wasn’t close to the house”. In recent years, the ding dong ditch
  prank, which has gained new popularity on social media, has involved other
  deadly tragedies. In 2023, a man in California was convicted of murder after
  intentionally ramming his car into a group of six teenagers who had rung his
  doorbell. Three of them were killed. Earlier this year, in May, a man in
  Virginia was charged with second-degree murder after fatally shooting a
  teenager who was filming a TikTok video of a doorbell prank at the man’s home
  around 3am, according to local authorities.
