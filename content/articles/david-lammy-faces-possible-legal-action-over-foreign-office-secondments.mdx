  David Lammy is facing possible legal action over a plan to invite staff from
  the oil firm Shell and the defence firm BAE Systems to work inside the
  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. A pre-action letter seen by the
  Guardian warns the foreign secretary that the scheme leaves the government
  open to allegations of a conflict of interest and creates the potential for
  “improper influence”. The scheme, which was first mooted by Lammy in March, is
  supposed to embed FCDO staff in firms to gain commercial experience while
  inviting private-sector staff to take placements in government. The Corner
  House, an environmental organisation, has raised concerns about alleged issues
  of compliance with human rights and other legal obligations. Leigh Day, the
  solicitors firm, has written to the FCDO warning that it may bring court
  proceedings on behalf of The Corner House. A legal letter seen by the Guardian
  claims that the scheme could be illegal and in breach of the civil service
  code. The letter, addressed to Lammy, has highlighted: An alleged lack of
  transparency as to how the proposed scheme will operate. The potential for
  improper influence by representatives of Shell and BAE Systems on UK
  government practices, including in relation to foreign policy. The potential
  for conflicts of interest. Nicholas Hildyard, the founder and director of The
  Corner House, said: “This scheme cries out for judicial scrutiny. Seconding
  employees from powerful corporations to the Foreign Office or other ministries
  and vice versa is a recipe for potential serious conflicts of interest. “Both
  Shell and BAE Systems have been accused of human rights violations in the
  past. This alone places them on a collision course with the government’s
  stated commitment to upholding human rights and international law.” It is
  understood that Shell disputes any claims of wrongdoing in the pre-action
  letter. Lammy raised the prospect of placing diplomats in multinationals in
  March. In a speech at the Chambers of Commerce, he said the FCDO would have to
  undergo a “sustained cultural transformation” to fully represent the interests
  of business. “Today I have written to the CEOs of some of the UK’s largest
  firms offering to send diplomats on placements to each of them, building on
  existing examples of placements at firms like Barclays and Octopus Energy, and
  offering each of them the opportunity for members of their teams to spend time
  gaining experience in the FCDO,” he said. Lammy wrote to Wael Sawan, the chief
  executive of Shell, to float the idea of an exchange programme. In a letter
  obtained by a freedom of information request, Lammy said his ambassadors
  around the globe had been tasked with helping “our companies in landing
  contracts, overcoming market access barriers, and winning investment
  internationally”. “I believe that the FCDO and Shell have a strong shared
  endeavour in trying to interpret and navigate the fast-evolving geopolitical
  context,” Lammy wrote. In June, the foreign secretary was reported to have
  invited staff from Shell and BAE Systems into Whitehall diplomatic roles to
  help “champion their interests overseas”. Lammy told the Times: “I will always
  put the economic interests of British workers first.” An FCDO spokesperson
  said: “We are striking new partnerships with British businesses to harness
  their expertise, champion their interests overseas and drive growth for the
  British public. “Part of the programme will see diplomats offered the
  opportunity to spend time working at some of the country’s biggest firms in
  order to bolster their commercial knowledge and experience. “Secondments
  between the civil service and the private sector are commonplace and the FCDO
  already sends staff on secondment to private companies, multilateral
  organisations and NGOs.” BAE Systems was approached for comment.
