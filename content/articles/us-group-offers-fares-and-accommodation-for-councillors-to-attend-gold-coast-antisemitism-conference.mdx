  A US-based group has written to hundreds of local mayors and councillors in
  Australia offering all-inclusive travel and accommodation to attend a Gold
  Coast summit dedicated to addressing antisemitism. At least one mayor has
  accepted the offer from the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), which would be
  funded by Australian companies and Jewish groups, while other councils are
  spending up to $6,500 to send multiple councillors to the conference, to be
  held from 3 to 5 September. Guardian Australia spoke to dozens of councils,
  many of whom said they had declined to attend the conference or decided that
  accepting money to do so would be inappropriate. The offer does not appear to
  breach any rules, but some councillors said it was surprising to have been
  directly offered financial assistance by a group that seeks to influence local
  government policy. One councillor from a Melbourne LGA said the offer was
  “highly unusual”. Another from a different council said they had “never seen
  anything like it” in their five years as a councillor. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email But the mayor of Glen Eira in Melbourne, Simone Zmood, who is
  speaking at the event, will have costs paid for by the sponsors, which include
  Meriton Suites, Southern Steel and groups including the Executive Council of
  Australian Jewry. A council spokesperson said: “We believe it’s important for
  Glen Eira’s voice to be part of national conversations that condemn
  antisemitism and work to prevent all forms of racism and hatred. “All travel
  and expenses will be appropriately disclosed.” It is understood
  representatives from other councils have also accepted the offer. Woollahra
  council in Sydney will spend $6,500 to send four councillors and the mayor,
  Sarah Swan, who will speak at the event without being paid. The deputy mayor
  of Stonnington in Melbourne’s south-east, Tom Humphries, will attend but has
  also declined assistance. So, too, have Melbourne’s deputy lord mayor, Roshena
  Campbell, and councillor Rafael Camillo, whose costs of $4,160 will be covered
  by the council. Robert Irlicht, a councillor in Melbourne’s Bayside, will
  attend but the council will not finance his costs. Irlicht was contacted for
  comment. The chief executive of Transparency International Australia, Clancy
  Moore, said: “When mayors or councillors accept paid trips or hospitality from
  lobby groups with a view to influencing council policy, it can raise questions
  about impartiality and public trust. “Even where no laws are broken, councils’
  own codes of conduct or gifts and hospitality policies should also be
  followed.” A coalition of leaders from the Australian Services Union, the
  advocacy group Democracy in Colour, the Jewish Council of Australia, Jewish
  Voices of Inner Sydney and Greens councillors have called for a boycott of the
  conference. They claim the offer of financial assistance amounts to a “paid
  junket” from a group they accuse of conflating criticism of Israel with
  antisemitism. They cite CAM’s push for all levels of government to adopt the
  controversial IHRA definition of antisemitism. The federal government’s
  antisemitism envoy, Jillian Segal, made the same recommendation in July,
  causing unease within federal Labor. Segal is a key speaker at the conference
  and will not be paid. CAM has denied claims it conflates criticism of Israel
  with antisemitism. A spokesperson said those paying for travel were clearly
  listed and that assistance was offered to ensure councils could receive
  “practical tools to strengthen social cohesion, reduce hate and build more
  inclusive communities across the nation”. “Bringing this global initiative to
  Australia is a recognition of the urgency we face here,” the spokesperson
  said, citing a spike in antisemitic attacks including the torching of
  synagogues. The mayor of Sydney’s Inner West council, Darcy Byrne, has
  rejected pressure to withdraw from the summit, including from Greens
  councillors. But he has criticised CAM for alleging this month’s march across
  the Sydney Harbour Bridge was an example of antisemitism “taking over” the
  city. A social media post by CAM said “these demonstrations were not about
  Gaza”, highlighting a poster of the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and a
  sign saying “Zionists are neo-Nazis” among an estimated crowd of between
  90,000 and 300,000 people. “In my address to the summit I will make plain our
  total opposition to the Netanyahu government’s atrocious conduct towards
  Palestinian civilians,” Byrne said. “I will also be stating categorically in
  my remarks at the event that depicting the citizens who attended the March for
  Humanity over the Harbour Bridge as antisemites is preposterous, absurd and
  insulting. “I will also insist that people like us, who oppose Netanyahu’s
  vicious regime, also have an obligation to oppose and stamp out antisemitism
  and racism in our own country. This is a basic principle that I would have
  thought all anti-racism advocates would support.” A CAM spokesperson said it
  had not condemned the march itself but highlighted “numerous manifestations of
  antisemitism”. “Our concern was directed at the hate speech, incitement to
  violence, glorification of terrorism, and Holocaust inversion that have no
  place on the streets of any city across the globe,” the spokesperson said.
