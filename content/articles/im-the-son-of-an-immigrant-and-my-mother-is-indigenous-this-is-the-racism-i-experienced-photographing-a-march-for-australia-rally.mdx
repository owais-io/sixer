  I was in Perth last week because my mother had died and Sunday was a day when
  I finally had something to do for myself. I’ve been a photojournalist for a
  few years and I went to the March for Australia rally because I wanted to see
  what would happen, and because I like to document these sort of things. I also
  needed a distraction. As the protesters walked past, some individuals were
  openly yelling out “fuck off you, black cunts” to counter-protesters. But a
  lot of the counter-protesters weren’t Indigenous or people of colour or black;
  they were mostly white-presenting. But it seemed very specific to yell out
  those words: “Fuck off, you black cunts.” In Perth there were two separate
  marches. One group set off on their march early, and then there was a second
  group. Some people in that second group were yelling out things such as
  “Australia for the white man!”, which I found very confronting. I was the only
  person of colour that was walking with them. I was taking photos as we walked.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email My dad’s a Māori and my mum’s a Yamatji woman
  from Western Australia. Hearing people yelling about immigrants, I thought it
  was hilarious; the funniest thing ever. They were denying their own history
  here, but you can understand that it comes from what they feel is a position
  of supremacy and they want ownership over this land that they claim to be
  theirs. I’m the son of an immigrant. My partner is an immigrant and my mother
  is Indigenous. I would have loved anyone to try and say anything to me.
  There’s two things about me: I’m Indigenous, and I also served this country in
  the Royal Australian Navy. So if anyone tried to say anything to me, I’d just
  say: “Well, mate …” I didn’t get any comments. I only got people staring at
  me, but it was mostly because they could see my camera. I did feel at risk
  because as I was walking along the main road in Perth. I was standing in front
  of them with my back to the marchers. I thought maybe someone’s going to come
  punch me in the back of the head. Maybe someone’s going to lob something over
  the top of the crowd and hit me in the back of the head. But I don’t think
  this crowd had it in them to be as violent as they were in Melbourne. It was
  really crazy over there. At one point, there was one man walking beside them
  on the left side of the path. He was yelling at them, that they were not
  welcome in Perth. And they were calling out to him: “You’re a traitor to your
  people!” I could have joined in. I could have helped that man out. I could
  have backed him up and confronted them as well. I’m just one man. I think the
  anti-immigration marches over the weekend were a wake-up call. A lot of people
  I had spoken to were upset that there weren’t enough people at the
  counter-protests – but they should have been there themselves. There’s no
  point being upset if you didn’t go. It seemed like on that day the protesters
  weren’t targeting the government. They did seem to have an issue with the
  government’s immigration policy but it didn’t seem as if they were fighting
  the government. They were attacking any person who didn’t look like them or
  fit their ideology.
