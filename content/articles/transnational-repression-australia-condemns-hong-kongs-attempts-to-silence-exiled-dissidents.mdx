  exiled dissidents

  The Australian government has signed a joint statement issued on behalf of G7
  nations condemning Hong Kong for seeking to “silence, intimidate, harass, harm
  or coerce” pro-democracy campaigners living abroad. The statement, which was
  also made on behalf of New Zealand, Sweden and the Netherlands, has described
  the issuing of arrest warrants and bounties for exiled dissidents as acts of
  “transnational repression” that undermine human rights and state sovereignty.
  Late last month, Hong Kong’s national security police issued arrest warrants
  for 19 activists based overseas, accusing them of subversion under a stringent
  national security law, marking the largest such tally yet. The 19 activists
  were accused of organising or participating in the Canada-based unofficial
  Hong Kong Parliament, a pro-democracy group that authorities in the Asian
  financial hub say intended to subvert state power, under the law Beijing
  imposed in 2020 after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Among the 19 people is the Australian pro-democracy
  campaigner Dr Feng Chongyi, who is a professor of China studies at the
  University of Technology Sydney. Speaking to the ABC in July, Feng described
  the arrest warrant as “political persecution and violation of basic human
  rights”. Two other exiled campaigners in Australia – Adelaide-based Ted Hui
  and Melbourne-based Kevin Yam – are also subject to arrest warrants and
  bounties. Earlier this year, anonymous letters and pamphlets were sent to
  properties in their respective cities offering $203,000 for information on
  their locations. The G7’s rapid response mechanism (G7RRM), which was
  established to help nations “identify and respond to foreign threats to
  democracies”, said the arrest warrants were punishing people for “exercising
  their freedom of expression”. “This form of transnational repression
  undermines national security, state sovereignty, human rights and the safety
  of communities,” the statement, first published by Canada, said. “We encourage
  individuals to report suspicious activities and any incidents of intimidation,
  harassment, coercion or threats to their law enforcement authorities in
  accordance with domestic laws and regulations. “G7RRM members and associate
  members are committed to strengthening our efforts to safeguard our
  sovereignty, to keep our communities safe and to defend individuals from the
  overreach of governments trying to silence, intimidate, harass or coerce them
  within our borders.” When the arrest warrants were made last month, the UK’s
  foreign and home secretaries issued a joint statement condemning
  “transnational repression” and said they would “not tolerate attempts by
  foreign governments” to intimidate their critics in the UK. In response to the
  arrests last month, the Chinese embassy in the UK said the British
  government’s remarks “constitute a gross interference” in China’s internal
  affairs and the rule of law in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s controversial national
  security law grants authorities sweeping extraterritorial powers to prosecute
  acts or comments made anywhere in the world that it deems criminal. Critics of
  the law say Hong Kong is using it to stifle dissent. Chinese and Hong Kong
  authorities have repeatedly said the law was vital to restoring stability
  after the city was rocked for months by sometimes violent anti-government and
  anti-China protests in 2019. Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong,
  complained about the targeted intimidation of exiled pro-democracy campaigners
  from Hong Kong directly to her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, during a
  bilateral meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July. In July 2023, China’s foreign
  ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged Australia, the UK and the US to stop
  sheltering activists subject to arrest warrants in Hong Kong. “Relevant
  countries need to respect China’s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong
  Kong, stop lending support for anti-China elements destabilising Hong Kong,
  and stop providing a safe haven for fugitives,” she said.
