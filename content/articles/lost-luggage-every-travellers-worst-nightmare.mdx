  It’s every traveller’s worst nightmare: you arrive at your destination, but
  your luggage doesn’t. Whether it’s due to a mishandled transfer, or a sneaky
  suitcase thief in the arrivals hall, lost luggage can quickly turn a holiday
  into a stressful ordeal. Here’s what to do if yours doesn’t turn up. Report
  your luggage as missing All baggage is managed by the airlines from check-in
  to arrival. So once you are sure your luggage has not arrived, report it as
  missing at your airline’s desk in the baggage reclaim hall (this is sometimes
  operated by a third-party ground handler). If there is no one at the desk,
  call your airline instead. File what’s known as a property irregularity report
  (PIR) before you leave the airport. This official document is used to report
  incidents involving damaged, lost or delayed baggage. It serves as a record of
  the incident and is essential for initiating claims and tracking the status of
  the baggage. To complete the PIR, you will need to provide: the details on
  your baggage claim tag (attached to your boarding pass or passport); your
  flight number and travel itinerary; a detailed description of your luggage;
  contact details; and a delivery address for where you are staying. The airline
  will give you a reference number. Keep it safe as you will need this if you
  end up making a compensation or insurance claim. You can also input the
  reference number into the WorldTracer website, which provides up-to-date
  information on the status of lost baggage. Meanwhile, the airline will use the
  information on the PIR to locate your luggage (hopefully). Know your rights
  Your rights to compensation for lost luggage depend on whether you are
  abroad/on holiday, or arriving home, when your suitcase goes walkabout. If you
  have arrived at your holiday destination, you will usually be entitled to
  reimbursement for essential items, such as toiletries, basic clothing,
  medication and baby items. Some airlines offer a daily allowance for each day
  that your luggage is delayed, while others will reimburse you if you provide
  receipts for items you have bought. You will get less cash from the airline if
  your luggage is delayed on your return home. This is because airlines presume
  you have clothes and other essentials available to you at home. If your
  luggage is found, you will be notified by phone or email. The onus is on the
  airline to return your luggage to you – you shouldn’t have to go back to the
  airport to collect it. If your bag is still missing after 21 days, it is
  officially declared lost. You can then file a claim for compensation directly
  with the airline. You will need to include a list of lost items (with
  estimated values), proof of purchase if available, receipts for interim
  expenses, and a copy of your PIR. The maximum compensation under international
  law (the Montreal Convention) is about £1,000 (the exact amount depends on
  currency fluctuations). Depending on your cover, your travel insurance may pay
  out for amounts over this limit if the airline refuses to fully cover the
  loss. Reduce the chances of your luggage getting lost Label your luggage
  inside and out with your name and contact details, and take a quick photo of
  your bags before checking in. Make sure you remove barcodes and tags from
  previous flights. Consider tracking devices such as AirTags or Bluetooth
  trackers for easier tracking in the event that your bag does get lost. Fly
  direct where possible. Direct flights significantly reduce the risk of lost
  luggage as they eliminate the potential for baggage transfer issues. If you
  need a layover, allow ample time for baggage transfers. Get to the luggage
  carousel as soon as you can. This will reduce the chance of your luggage being
  stolen or taken by someone else by mistake. Use a unique luggage tag or
  accessory to make your bag easily identifiable. Pack essentials, vital
  medication, a change of clothes and high-value items, in your hand luggage,
  just in case.
