  A rainy part of the world where locals’ tea-drinking habits verge on
  obsessive. That may sound familiar, but a shared love of tea is where
  similarities between Turkey’s Rize province and the UK start and end. In fact,
  this corner of the country feels more like a mythical land, a fairytale mix of
  mist-shrouded mountains and dramatically plunging valleys cloaked in
  impenetrably deep, dark forests. Despite the dramatic landscapes,
  international tourism has never really taken off here. Running between the
  eastern edge of the Black Sea and the rugged Pontic Alps, just shy of the
  Georgian border, it’s been a tricky spot to reach, historically (a bus journey
  of about 19 hours from Istanbul – though an airport opened in 2022, which cuts
  this to two hours). I became intrigued by Rize when researching a book on the
  world’s best road trips. I spent weeks cruising the globe’s highways, country
  lanes and mountain passes via Google Street View. When I reached Turkey, I
  noticed a long green belt running along its northern coastline and discovered
  a land of dense tea plantations, cliff-hugging roads, roaring rivers and
  wooden villages. Curious to find out more, I convinced a friend to come on a
  road trip to the Fırtına valley, home to some of the region’s most spectacular
  scenery (as well as being its most accessible area – large swathes are serious
  wilderness and should only be visited with a guide). Rize is the name of both
  the province and its capital city, an unassuming coastal hub. We decide to
  prioritise our time in deep nature, so head straight for the mountains in our
  hire car rather than lingering in town. As we head east towards the Fırtına
  valley, our route is lined by the shimmering turquoise waters of the Black Sea
  on one side and rolling tea plantations on the other, where the steep
  hillsides are dotted with workers gathering leaves into wicker baskets
  strapped to their backs. Rize has been Turkey’s leading tea-producing region
  since the 1940s. It is the country’s wettest region, but rain tends to
  dissipate quickly during the summer months, leaving thin wisps of mist
  trailing across the hilltops. After about 20 minutes, we reach the mouth of
  the Fırtına River. The name translates as “stormy” and its waters crash along
  the rocky riverbed. The further along it we drive, the more ferocious it
  becomes; the valley sides loom over us, their steep slopes blanketed in dense
  forests (apparently home to a growing population of brown bears). After half
  an hour, we reach Çamlıhemşin. The town skirts the riverbanks precipitously,
  cradled by towering, mossy cliffs. We wander along its main street as the sun
  sets, passing a few tea houses, bakeries and shops selling honey and local
  cheese. Dinner is at the Çamlıhemşin cafe-restaurant on the river, where we
  feast on chargrilled chicken skewers, white bean stew in a rich tomato sauce,
  and hunks of bread. With the help of Google Translate, our waiter proudly
  tells us that the loaf is homemade. After dinner, a staggering series of
  hairpin bends leads to our accommodation: Dudi Konağı, a towering stone
  mansion that clings to the valleyside. Once one of the grandest private homes
  in the region, it was built in the early 1900s by the Tarakçıoğlu family, who
  made their fortunes in Russia. Today it’s a 24-room guesthouse with restored
  timber panelling, carved stone fireplaces and rustic wooden furnishings. We’re
  ushered up to our room on the third floor, where we fall asleep to the sound
  of a nearby stream and the soft croaking of frogs. The next day, we head off
  deeper into the valley, towards the lofty, snow-capped peaks of the Kaçkar
  mountains. We trace the course of the river, passing thundering waterfalls
  hidden within corridors of beech and chestnut trees, and stone bridges that
  date back to the early years of the Ottoman empire. Our first stop is Zil
  castle, a 14th-century fortress that rises above the thick forest canopy.
  Historians believe it was constructed by the empire of Trebizond, an offshoot
  of the Byzantine empire that thrived along the Silk Road. For centuries, Zil
  castle guarded a critical mountain pass that connected inland routes with
  ports on the Black Sea, watching over caravans carrying spices and silks
  between Europe and Asia. Today, it’s a miraculously preserved masterpiece of
  medieval engineering, with sweeping panoramic views across the valley. As we
  press on, we spot a colourful new addition to the landscape: rhododendron
  bushes. These plants, bursting with bright purple flowers in early summer, are
  responsible for one of the region’s more unusual delicacies, deli bal (or “mad
  honey”). The nectar of this native variety of rhododendron contains a
  neurotoxin that slows the heart rate, is said to pack a hallucinogenic punch
  and has aphrodisiac properties. The honey is among the world’s most expensive.
  With the land too steep and rugged for regular agriculture, beekeeping is big
  business here. The region is home to the Hemshin people, an ethnic minority
  who originated in Armenia but have been present in the Black Sea region since
  the eighth century. This relative isolation has helped keep its distinctive
  language, culture and traditions alive. One age-old custom is black hive
  beekeeping, which involves hoisting hives high into the branches of hornbeam
  trees, so they are out of the reach of greedy bears. As we edge out of the
  Fırtına valley, the road turns to a rocky track and snakes upwards into the
  Kaçkar mountains. We head deeper into the clouds until we’re enveloped by
  thick mist. Our final stop, Elevit, is a small mountain hamlet, which perches
  prettily on a high-altitude plateau. People only live here in the summer
  months to tend their livestock, then descend to the towns when the snow
  arrives. It’s still quite early in the year and the village is eerily quiet.
  The mist adds to the mysterious atmosphere: shuttered wooden chalets appear
  ghost-like through the haze; a technicolour blanket of wildflowers has a thin,
  dewy sheen. Behind the fog lie the high peaks of the Kaçkars. An extension of
  the Caucasus, the range extends 620 miles along Turkey’s Black Sea coast,
  making them more than twice as long as the Pyrenees. While it’s possible to
  hike here without a guide, it’s not advisable. The area isn’t properly set up
  for day hikers; paths through the rugged terrain aren’t marked clearly. Had we
  more time, we would sign ourselves up for a guided trek – offered by the likes
  of Montis and Two Ararat – to explore the untamed wilderness of lofty peaks,
  glacial lakes and mountain pastures. But with our road trip set to continue
  over the border into Georgia, our exploration into the Kaçkars ends in Elevit.
  We drive back to Çamlıhemşin with dusk casting an amber glow over the valley,
  the river below glinting like a ribbon of steel between the darkening trees.
  We end our day playing backgammon (or tavla) in a dimly lit, wood-panelled tea
  house that feels like a working men’s club. The clientele sip tea from
  tulip-shaped glasses as their wooden counters clack speedily across the board.
  The proprietor asks us what we make of his region. “Güzel,” (beautiful) we
  tell him. He gives us a wide grin and nods. It’s easy to understand why this
  place inspires such fierce pride in those who call it home. Rize is not
  packaged for mass tourism, and that’s precisely what makes it worth exploring
  – a place that still feels wild, where ancient cultures live on, and the tea
  is always hot. Accommodation was provided by Dudi Konağı (dudikonagi.com);
  rooms from €140 a night B&amp;B
