  pro-Palestine protests

  Handcuffed and being hauled into the back of a police van, Tim Crosland still
  managed to crack a smile after being arrested under the Terrorism Act last
  month. “The mother of all democracies, people,” the former government lawyer
  can be seen saying in now viral footage after he was one of 27 people arrested
  at the Gandhi statue in Parliament Square for allegedly showing support for a
  proscribed organisation, Palestine Action. Five weeks later, Crosland, 55, is
  once again at the centre of the action before what is expected to be a return
  to the square on Saturday by hundreds of people risking arrest under
  anti-terrorism laws. Defend Our Juries, of which he is a co-founder, has asked
  them to hold up signs saying: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
  The moment is also a milestone in a personal “gamekeeper turned poacher”
  journey that has taken him from being a barrister holding senior positions at
  the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and National Crime Agency (NCA), to
  being a radical activist using street protest to challenge the will of the
  state. “Over time, I came to the conclusion that no, you do not make
  substantial change from the inside,” Crosland recalls of his time working for
  government. A large part of his role had been to advise on human rights
  obligations, but he now believes he was naive about this and there was a
  substantial gap between the rhetoric of government organisations about rights,
  and the reality. “The forces are too strong, too powerful, you can delude
  yourself that you’re making an impact and then you can look back and see that
  it’s just gone back to where it was.” Born in Hammersmith, west London,
  Crosland attended the prestigious private school St Paul’s, where the future
  chancellor George Osborne was a year below him. A vegetarian from a young age,
  he went on to study classics at Oxford, took a law conversion course and
  became a barrister. His legal career before joining government led him to a
  life-changing experience when he worked in the deep south of the US on death
  row appeals – the case of a 17-year-old in New Orleans was particularly
  shocking. While the work on behalf of those on death row is something he had
  in common with Keir Starmer, it was not until joining government that he
  crossed paths with the future prime minister, then a young lawyer. At SOCA,
  Crosland recalls instructing Starmer to write advice on positive human rights
  obligations and then on the intersection with the duty of care. “I remember
  what he wrote was so bad we had to go to him and ask him to redo it,” adds
  Crosland, who says Starmer’s initial effort was “flaky” and he had not engaged
  with the question. “He did deal with it reasonably gracefully when we said we
  were expecting a little bit more than that and came back with something much
  better.” After leaving government, Crosland became an environmental lawyer,
  co-founding the campaign group Plan B, which was one of the parties that
  brought a landmark legal case against Heathrow’s owners over a planned third
  runway. In a change of events that would lead to him being disbarred in 2023,
  he was fined £5,000 in 2021 for criminal contempt of court after deliberately
  making public a supreme court ruling related to the airport before the result
  was officially announced. Since then he has gone from being in trouble with
  his friends in law, to being in trouble with the law itself. Police are yet to
  charge him and others who were arrested last month – he believes they are
  waiting in part to see what happens with a legal challenge of Palestine
  Action’s proscription. Either way, opting out of further activism is not an
  option for Crosland, who talks of “having a duty to intervene”. “We are
  talking about deeply peaceful, principled people who are trying to stop
  atrocities,” he says of what might be his true “tribe”, the climate activists
  and those campaigning against Israel’s actions in Gaza. “That is my
  understanding of non-violent action. It doesn’t mean sitting back quietly in a
  corner.”
