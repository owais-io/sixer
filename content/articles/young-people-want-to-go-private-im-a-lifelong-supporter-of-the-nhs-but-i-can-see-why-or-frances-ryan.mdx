  It is 10.25am on a Friday and I am Googling “online pharmacies”. I have a mild
  infection and I weigh up whether talking to an AI doctor will be more
  efficient than queueing at my GP surgery before the weekend. After a
  seven-minute multiple-choice questionnaire, I am deemed eligible for
  antibiotics: a single sachet is £43. I close the page and consider spending
  the cash self-medicating with a family-size Uber Eats instead. I thought of
  this later as I read the news that half of millennials in the UK are planning
  to use private healthcare in the next year. A survey by the Independent
  Healthcare Provider Network found that those aged 34 to 44 were the most
  likely age group to go private. Forty-nine per cent said they were likely to
  use it in the next 12 months, with young professionals increasingly opting for
  employment with medical insurance. Forget career progression or annual leave,
  nowadays jobseekers want eye tests and cancer checks. As a millennial with the
  long-term health conditions of a boomer, I can identify with this mindset.
  I’ve always been ideologically against private healthcare, to the extent that
  when that Bupa advert comes on the TV where the woman in remission from cancer
  dances joyfully, I involuntarily yell: “Parasites! Did she have to sell her
  home to pay for chemotherapy?!” But with NHS waiting lists still sky high,
  like many, I’ve found myself relying on private healthcare for the first time.
  When I had nerve damage in my arm and was struggling to type this column, I
  reluctantly booked an appointment with a private physiotherapist rather than
  waiting several months on the NHS. Without private insurance, I paid the £75
  an hour cost and felt lucky that I could afford to. This is clearly a problem
  for the individual: a generation who entered the workforce during a global
  recession and has to pay astronomical costs for house deposits and childcare
  is now expected to find cash for healthcare too. But it is also a problem for
  the rest of society: a 40-year-old who will probably pay taxes for the next 25
  years but already doesn’t feel as if they get enough from the NHS will be less
  invested in the service in the future, and at worst, resentful in light of
  intergenerational inequality and an ageing population they will need to
  support. The government knows it. In a speech this summer, the health
  secretary, Wes Streeting, warned that younger people “opting out” of the NHS
  and going private “presents an existential risk to the health service”. “The
  NHS feels increasingly slow and outdated to the generation that organises
  their lives at the touch of a button,” he said. “If you get annoyed at
  Deliveroo not getting your dinner to you in less than an hour, how will you
  feel being told to wait a year for a knee operation?” There is some truth to
  Streeting’s statement: a demographic that is tech savvy and can organise their
  social and professional lives on demand feel particularly put off by a
  healthcare system in which they have to call a landline at 8am to book an
  appointment or wait for the post to tell them about a scan in nine months.
  When I went private for physio, I was struck by the flexibility and
  patient-led focus: while the NHS often struggles to provide an appointment at
  a time that’s accessible to my chronic fatigue (and is openly baffled by the
  request), the private clinic was happy to do it in two halves to fit with my
  energy levels. But it is disingenuous – and a distraction – to suggest that
  the shift to private provision is about a craving for choice or even quicker
  care, as if millennials are Carrie Bradshaw shopping around for high-end
  healthcare. In the survey by the Independent Healthcare Provider Network,
  nearly half of respondents cited difficulties getting an NHS appointment at
  all as the main reason for using private healthcare. One in 10 said they did
  so because their NHS appointment was outright cancelled or postponed. For
  many, going private isn’t about wanting a choice – it’s a reflection of the
  fact a creaking NHS means they increasingly don’t have one. When we talk about
  the encroachment of private companies on the universal healthcare model, we
  tend to hear about the logistics: the NHS now outsources nearly £3.5bn of
  procedures to private hospitals to help speed up waiting lists, despite most
  doctors who do the private surgeries being siphoned off from the NHS. And yet
  the issue is also our political culture – one that nudges the public ever
  closer to accepting private healthcare as a necessity rather than a luxury.
  Whether it is Nigel Farage floating the idea of a mix of private and public
  healthcare or Tony Blair advocating for “an expanded role” for private firms,
  the strategy is clear enough: starve the NHS of resources, and drive down the
  quality and availability of the service, and patients will get used to looking
  elsewhere. That younger people increasingly treat employer health insurance as
  a requirement rather than a perk shows how effective this cultural shift has
  been: a US-style connection between work and health means medical care can be
  viewed bit by bit not as a right for all, but a privilege for the LinkedIn
  few. We have already seen this with dentistry, with it becoming the norm in
  recent years for patients to be left without an NHS dentist even for critical
  care. The end result is a lesson in what happens when universal coverage
  disappears: private dentists have hiked up their prices, while record numbers
  of people are turning to dental insurance and those without cover pull out
  their own teeth. In the end, I braved the GP’s surgery. The process was
  reassuring in its mundanity: a short wait on the phone, a 10-minute call, then
  a prescription bought with a pre-payment certificate at no extra cost. If it
  wasn’t too on the nose, I would suggest every doctor’s surgery in the country
  changes its hold music to Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell. “Don’t it always
  seem to go / That you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone …” Frances
