  Shell has axed the construction of its biofuels plant in the Netherlands,
  ending what would have been one of the biggest converters of waste into green
  jet fuel in Europe. The oil company, which paused construction at the site in
  July last year to tackle technical problems, said it had decided not to
  restart building after it found the plant would be “insufficiently
  competitive” to meet demand for “affordable, low-carbon products”. The move to
  scrap the project in Rotterdam marks another setback for its biofuel designs,
  after the company cancelled a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project on
  Singapore’s Bukom Island in March 2023. It comes amid a wider shift away from
  renewable energy projects in the oil and gas sector as fossil fuel companies
  pursue higher profits. In March last year Shell watered down a key emissions
  target, setting out a plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the
  energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade compared with its previous
  goal of 20%. Shell began construction of the plant in Rotterdam in the
  Netherlands in 2021, initially expecting to start producing up to 820,000
  tonnes of biofuels, with plans to bring it online in April 2024. This was
  later pushed back to 2025. Machteld de Haan, the company’s head of downstream,
  renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and
  the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be
  insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable,
  low-carbon products. “This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we
  prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of
  our customers and value for our shareholders.” She added that the company
  continued “to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will
  underpin the future energy system” and that Shell was “one of the world’s
  largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation
  fuel”. About half of the biofuels from the plant in Rotterdam were expected to
  be used for SAF, made from waste cooking oil and animal fat. Proponents of SAF
  believe it could be crucial for airlines to cut their carbon emissions in line
  with global climate targets, although critics argue it is not a realistic
  alternative given the limited timescale to prevent rising emissions from
  creating a climate disaster. The aviation industry accounts for about 3% of
  the world’s carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.
