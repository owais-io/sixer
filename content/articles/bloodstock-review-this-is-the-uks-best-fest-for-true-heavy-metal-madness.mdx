  As Download leans further and further into stadium rock, having booked the
  likes of Fall Out Boy and Green Day in recent years, Bloodstock is becoming
  the UK’s go-to festival for true heavy metal madness. Trivium, Machine Head
  and Gojira headline this edition of the 20,000-capacity gathering, making for
  one of the most stacked lineups in recent memory. On Friday, Emperor prove why
  they’re still black metal’s measuring stick, despite having released no new
  music since 2001. Such tracks as I Am the Black Wizards are masterpieces of
  infernal majesty, keyboards blaring while singer/guitarist Ihsahn shrieks and
  makes his instrument wail. No other band combine adrenaline, anguish and
  ambition this excellently. Charging back after a Bullet for My Valentine
  co-headline tour ended in ugly fashion, Trivium bring every bell and whistle
  they can. The Floridians cover Black Sabbath and Metallica, then inflate a
  gigantic mascot, comparable to Iron Maiden’s Eddie, to hammer home the sense
  of occasion. Guest appearances from Machine Head, Sleep Token, Malevolence and
  Emperor members reaffirm these 90 minutes as a proud celebration of all things
  metal. Machine Head returned to the festival circuit after eight years away
  with an intimate set at Bloodstock 2022, and on Saturday, the thrashers
  triumph at full scale. Where Davidian blows through presumably the entire pyro
  budget, Darkness Within gets thousands of phone torches piercing the air. But
  the most amazing moment is Halo: a nine-minute labyrinth of harmonies and
  solos, worthy of the extreme metal Mount Rushmore. The band’s crowd-surfer
  count of 1,011 sets a new festival record. Sunday wraps up with a one-two
  punch of prog metal. Despite weathering an acrimonious split with founding
  guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds in March, Mastodon haven’t lost an iota of
  strength. Temporary member Nick Johnston fits right in, to the point that he
  and co-shredder Bill Kelliher play rock-paper-scissors during one staccato
  riff, and Blood and Thunder smacks as mightily as ever. And Gojira’s blazing
  set is more a victory lap than a statement of intent. In 2018, Bloodstock
  became the first festival to recognise the crusaders’ headline potential, and
  they return as proven arena-fillers. Flying Whales and Another World are
  supercharged yet conscious anthems that hardly need the accompanying cinematic
  visuals to bolster their impact. The most action-packed weekend on 2025’s
  heavy metal calendar has come to a very apt close.
