  The actor Gal Gadot has said that she credits a “pressure on celebrities to
  speak out against Israel” with the failure of last year’s live action remake
  of Snow White. Her co-star, Rachel Zegler, showed her support for Palestine
  while promoting the film, writing on X: “i love you all so much! thank you for
  the love and for 120m views on our trailer in just 24 hours! what a whirlwind.
  i am in the thick of rehearsals for romeo + juliet so i’m gonna get outta
  here. bye for now. and always remember, free palestine.” Shortly after the
  post, producer Marc Platt flew to New York to speak to the star. His son,
  Jonah, later called her actions “immature” and said they were to blame for the
  film’s poor reviews. Gadot is Israeli and reportedly began to receive an
  increased number of death threats in the aftermath of Zegler’s post, with
  Disney upping her security as a result. As reported by the Jerusalem Post,
  Gadot said she “really enjoyed filming” Snow White during an appearance on
  Israeli TV show The A Talks, adding she had “even enjoyed working with Rachel
  Zegler”. Gadot said she had been “sure this movie was going to be a huge
  success”, but “then October 7 happened” and there was “a lot of pressure” on
  celebrities in Hollywood “to speak out against Israel”. The actor went on to
  say she was “disappointed” the film was “greatly affected” by such pressure
  and “didn’t do well” at the box office as a result. Marc Webb’s live action
  remake had already been dogged by negative buzz over issues including
  uncertainty about their approach to the dwarves. Speaking in 2022, the actor
  Peter Dinklage called the film “fucking backwards”. “I was a little taken
  aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow
  White,” Dinklage told podcaster Marc Maron, “but you’re still telling the
  story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”. The film, whose production budget
  was an estimated $270m, ended up taking around $205m worldwide – a
  disappointing but not catastrophic result. Reviews, however, were almost
  universally negative, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw calling it
  “exhausting awful”. Gadot served as a combat fitness instructor in the IDF
  army for two years, including during the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006. Speaking
  in 2024, Gadot spoke at the Anti-Defamation League’s summit, saying: “Never
  did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities
  around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating,
  justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews.”
