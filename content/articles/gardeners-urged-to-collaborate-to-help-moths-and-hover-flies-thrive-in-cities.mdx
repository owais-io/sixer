  Gardeners have been urged to work with their neighbours to support moths and
  hover flies after research found them to be particularly sensitive to urban
  landscapes. While bees get most of the attention when it comes to supporting
  pollinators in our cities, researchers found that their less glamorous – but
  no less important – counterparts from other orders are even more acutely
  affected by urbanisation. Three researchers from Sheffield’s school of
  biosciences investigated the impact that urbanisation in the UK was having on
  pollinators and found that urban landscapes support 43% fewer pollinator
  species, with the biggest declines evident the further into the heart of the
  city they went. Emilie Ellis, the lead author of the study who carried out the
  work as part of her PhD, said: “The original focus was going to be on bees as
  they’re the most charismatic species. “But then my interest in moths added
  this on to it, and then [co-author Stuart Campbell]’s interest in flies
  included hover flies. That’s the kind of cool novelty of this manuscript, that
  we included three different pollinating groups that are very diverse.” The
  research, carried out over the summer of 2019, involved Ellis visiting
  allotments in Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield, in varying urban densities, to
  sample the number of pollinating insects from all three groups. “We just
  collected insects every month for six months in eight sites in each city – so
  it was a lot of driving.” Their findings were sobering. They found that for
  every 10% increase in impervious surfaces – such as roads and building cover –
  there was a reduction of up to 7.5% in the variety of pollinating species. But
  the number of moths and hover flies of any species took a far greater hit
  compared with the number of bees. “We hypothesise that this could be due to
  the fact that they’ve got more complex life cycles because they need those
  different kind of resources other than flowers to become adults,” Ellis said.
  But that crucial vulnerability also contains a potential answer. If gardeners
  and urban planners bear in mind the needs of other pollinators, then there are
  straightforward ways to cater to them. “We’re so good now planting flowers for
  pollinators like bees and that could be the reason why we’re not seeing them
  decline,” Ellis added. “It’s just a matter of taking these guys into account
  and maybe having some more shrubs or a pond or something like that to also
  benefit those insects. “The diversity of habitat is the most important – so
  you need your flower patch, you need a tree, you need some shrubs, you need an
  untouched bit of grass – and kind of just keeping the patches that you have
  diverse and catering for all different types of insects and animals. “A huge
  thing that’s important is collaborating and talking to your neighbours and
  families and friends and encouraging them to do it too. Because an individual
  allotment or flower garden is pretty small and almost useless, but when you
  create a whole network of people that are interested and engaged these small
  little patches can become these huge habitat networks in cities.” Ellis and
  her colleagues’ findings are published in the Royal Society’s biological
  research journal Proceedings B.
