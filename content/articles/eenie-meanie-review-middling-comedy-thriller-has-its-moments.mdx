  Back in the 2000s or early 2010s, a film like Eenie Meanie would have been a
  late summer theatrical play, a mid-budget star vehicle with enough genre
  elements to hopefully lure back the blockbuster crowd. There are car chases
  and shootouts with absurdly attractive people in the middle of them and
  recognisable “that guy from” faces surrounding. But even back then it would
  have been a gamble without an A-lister attached, the film probably going the
  way of the many non-Fast &amp; Furious car flops like Driven, Speed Racer,
  Drive Angry and Need for Speed. Now, it’s a much more obvious, and far safer,
  fit for streaming, with Disney wisely nudging this one to a Hulu/Disney+
  premiere. Eenie Meanie still has the feel of something that was once on a
  bigger screen, though, with a reported $50m budget edging it above many of the
  season’s multiplex offerings (more than say Weapons, Nobody 2, Materialists or
  Freakier Friday). Exactly how and why this particular package was deemed
  worthy of such an unusual spend (in this climate!) is a bit of a
  head-scratcher, as the film is a mildly diverting yet strangely dated caper, a
  watered-down Tarantino rip-off without a soul of its own. It’s the feature
  debut of writer-director Shawn Simmons, who created the one-and-done action
  series Wayne and co-created John Wick spin-off The Continental, both shows not
  really leaving that much of an impression. But the former was exec-produced by
  Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, the duo who co-wrote the Deadpool series, and
  they have also shepherded this one, with the franchise’s almost $3bn gross
  granting them a certain amount of special treatment at Disney. The smug
  irreverence of those films is mercifully kept in check here (the humour is
  more misfiring than actively annoying) but there’s a similar balance of action
  and comedy that’s also come to typify their work elsewhere. The pair have also
  written the execrable streaming duds 6 Underground and Ghosted (their finest
  work, by a considerable amount, is their smart, terrifying Alien riff Life).
  Simmons’s script is marginally better than their worst and he does have an
  uncanny ability to construct genuine surprises, especially in the first act,
  but his sharp left turns soon fade and the journey ahead becomes a little too
  obvious. The star in the vehicle is Samara Weaving, the Australian Home and
  Away actor turned model turned genre mainstay best known for films like Ready
  or Not, The Babysitter and Scream VI. She plays Edie, an unlikely getaway
  driver, trained from a young age, nicknamed Eenie Meanie, who has turned her
  back on a life of crime, choosing the straight and narrow. But she’s dragged
  back in by her troublesome ex-boyfriend (Karl Glusman) whose latest mistake
  reunites her with former boss (Andy Garcia) and a far-fetched heist with
  life-or-death consequences. It’s the old “one last job” tale, filled with an
  inevitable array of overly quirky characters (brief appearances from Randall
  Park, Marshawn Lynch, Steve Zahn and Jermaine Fowler) and dialogue that
  confuses swearing with actual jokes (the limp banter is almost entirely
  zinger-free). Formative shared history with Glusman’s handsome yet
  consistently awful ex (referred to as “the 9/11 of fucking human beings”)
  never quite explains why someone as smart and savvy as Edie/Eenie would
  continue to risk everything for him. Glusman plays dumb well, although
  Weaving, struggling with an awkward midwestern accent, is a little
  indistinctive as a lead despite the flashy chaos that engulfs her. Their
  low-investment back-and-forth relationship can’t propel us through the more
  serious stretches, the film more effective when nothing or no one really
  matters. When that is the case, when we’re fixed behind the wheel with $50m to
  spend, the film zips into action and Simmons is a dab hand at choreographing
  an involving and kinetic car chase. He also throws in another left-turn in the
  finale, one that’s initially daring yet ultimately unsatisfying as he doesn’t
  quite know where to take us next, leaving us with an endnote of unearned
  sentimentality. It’s a bumpy road for Eenie and an even bumpier one for us.
  Eenie Meanie is now available on Hulu in the US and on Disney+ elsewhere
