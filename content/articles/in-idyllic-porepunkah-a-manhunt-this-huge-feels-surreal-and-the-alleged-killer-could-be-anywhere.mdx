  It would have been idyllic were it not for the sound of a police helicopter
  reverberating over the valley. By late afternoon on Wednesday the rain had
  slowed to a drizzle in Porepunkah. Mist curled around the foothills of Mt
  Buffalo. Cows and sheep grazed under a grey sky, unperturbed by the massive
  manhunt around them. A day before, Dezi Freeman had vanished into the dense
  bushland surrounding the semi-remote property he lived on after he allegedly
  shot and killed two police officers and injured a third after they came to
  execute an arrest warrant on him. They were detective leading senior constable
  Neal Thompson, 59, a local detective planning his retirement, and senior
  constable Vadim De Waart, 35, who was on temporary assignment in Victoria’s
  alpine region. Freeman had been living with his family on a bush block at the
  end of a dirt road a few kilometres outside Porepunkah, a small town in
  Victoria’s high country surrounded by bushland on one side and pine
  plantations on the other. Journalists and camera crews that had stopped at a
  police roadblock on Mt Buffalo Road on Wednesday evening thought they heard
  what sounded like shots from the direction of the property. Paramedic cars and
  unmarked police vehicles arrived not long afterwards. But the latest from
  police on Wednesday evening was that the search would continue. A convoy of
  police vehicles including armoured Bearcats were seen leaving the roadblock
  area where the alleged shooter had been living. The roadblock remained in
  place and Victoria police said there would be no extra information this
  evening. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Victoria police chief
  commissioner, Mike Bush, on Wednesday morning conceded Freeman, a “sovereign
  citizen” who had professed his hatred of police during previous brushes with
  the law, understood bushcraft well and knew the land better than the scores of
  officers searching for him. There had been no confirmed sightings of Freeman
  since the attack, Bush said. He said police had not recovered any firearms
  from the property where the shooting took place, leading officers to believe
  Freeman had taken them all with him. Bush said there was no reason to believe
  Freeman had left the area, and that every available officer had been deployed
  in the effort to find him. Almost a decade ago, the force used similar
  resources in the same region while hunting armed fugitives Mark and Gino
  Stocco, who had also shot at police. Marty Robinson, who owns the mechanic
  shop in town, said he knew Freeman and his family. He described Freeman as a
  “new age Ned Kelly” who would be “pretty handy in the bush” even with up to a
  metre of snow forecast for the region over the next three days. “I’m not
  saying he’s a hero or a legend but he’s someone’s father.” Standing on
  Porepunkah’s main street, gesturing up at the hills behind him, Robinson said
  the police “could be up there for weeks looking for” him. Unprompted, Robinson
  remarked on Freeman’s fringe views. “He doesn’t fit in and he doesn’t go along
  with the rules and he’s an antivaxxer – that’s all probably true,” he said.
  Robinson said Porepunkah still felt like a “sleepy little town” to him. Other
  residents said they were shocked. Porepunkah is in a picturesque part of
  north-eastern Victoria, not far from Falls Creek and Mt Hotham. The petrol
  station on the main street doubles as place to hire ski gear. One local, who
  asked not to be named, said the town was “wholesome” and home to a “really
  lovely community”. “It’s not some conspiracy theorist town,” they said.
  “What’s happened – in any place [it would be] so far out of the ordinary. So
  it’s quite surreal really.” On such a wintry day, you could imagine most
  people would have remained indoors even if police, who transformed a local
  winery into a temporary operations centre, hadn’t sent automated text messages
  to everyone in the area warning them to stay inside while Freeman was on the
  run. Those who left home to go to work, or ducked out to get a coffee or
  collect their mail, were met with a throng of journalists, photographers and
  camera crews in town, most of whom who had driven up from Melbourne. Another
  Porepunkah local, Jesslyn Ellis, said she lived down the road from Freeman and
  believed he had lived in the area for about 25 years. “I never really knew him
  but I knew of him,” she said. “I just feel so sorry for his family. Obviously,
  I feel for the police and their families too.” Despite the inclement weather,
  Ellis said she was sure Freeman knew “how to look after himself” out in the
  bush. “He could be in a cave. He could be down a mine. He could show up
  anywhere,” she said. Kealan Lee, who was driving through the town on his way
  home to Yarrawonga from a visit to the dentist, said it was a “pretty rugged”
  place. “I used to come up here four-wheel driving as a kid. There’s not much
  open space,” he said. “Where he is and how they’re gonna find him, that’s
  anyone’s guess.” With additional reporting by Cait Kelly
