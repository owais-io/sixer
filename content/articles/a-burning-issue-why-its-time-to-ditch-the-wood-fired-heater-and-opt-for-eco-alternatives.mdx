  A burning issue: why it’s time to ditch the wood-fired heater and opt for eco
  alternatives

  There’s something romantic about sitting by an open fireplace in winter time.
  But there’s growing evidence of the damage wood-fired heaters and open fires
  are doing to our health – and the environment. As a group of University of
  Technology Sydney academics recently put it – “a wood-fired heater is like
  having a truck idling in your living room all day (albeit with the bulk of the
  emissions escaping via the chimney)”. So what do we know about wood burning
  and are there alternatives for those wanting a cosy open-fire feel in their
  home without damaging the Earth? What the evidence says According to a 2024
  study, wood burning in fireplaces and heaters is one of the biggest sources of
  air pollution in many parts of Australia. While only about 10% of Australian
  homes use wood burning as their primary heat source, they create more than
  half of Australia’s fine particulate pollution. The health costs of this are
  bad enough, but the effect on the planet is also significant. Even so-called
  eco friendly wood heaters are doing damage - producing more particulate
  pollution than a modern truck. That’s because burning firewood in fireplaces
  and domestic heaters produces methane and black carbon particles that worsen
  global heating. One study estimates that wood heaters cause as much or more
  emissions than gas or reverse-cycle air conditioning. On top of that, much of
  the firewood sold in urban areas comes from forest timber – further depleting
  essential carbon banks. Lisa Cunial is a psychologist who has lived in Orange
  in NSW for more than 20 years. She says Orange is cold for seven months of the
  year and a lot of people use wood-burning heaters in their homes. “Being quite
  a major regional city, it’s a real problem.” After the 2019 bushfires, Cunial
  ended up in hospital with severe breathing difficulties. “Wood is very much
  part of the culture here. But for me it means I literally have to stay inside
  the house with air filters even though I live near bushland and a wetland,”
  she says. Mapping wood heater pollution Fay Johnston, the director of the
  Centre for Safe Air and professor of environmental epidemiology at the
  University of Tasmania’s Menzies Institute for Medical Research recently
  created a wood heater pollution map showing which parts of Australia are
  estimated to have the most severe air pollution from wood heaters. “When
  people think of pollution they often picture smokestacks, vehicle exhaust and
  coal-fired power stations, but wood heaters pollute more fine particulate
  matter into the air we breathe than any of these sources,” she says. Johnston
  also points to the impact of firewood collection on Australia’s forests and
  habitat. “One study estimated that, if we stopped burning wood and clearing
  forest for heating, Australia would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions
  by 8.7m tonnes each year, about one-fifth of Australia’s car emissions. What
  can you do? According to Arabella Daniel, a Melbourne inner-city councillor
  and clean air community advocate who runs My Air Quality Australia, in the
  absence of strong public health or climate messaging, wood heating is wrongly
  seen as desirable and natural. “That lifestyle image is pushed, but the health
  [and environmental] impacts are ignored,” she says. Wood heaters are sold
  cheaply with no warnings, despite evidence of serious environmental harm.
  “Burning wood is normalised, yet it worsens air pollution and contributes to
  climate change. Harvesting firewood damages biodiversity and depletes
  forests.” She says now is the time for the Australian government to recognise
  wood heater pollution as a serious public health and climate issue, and to
  provide subsidies to phase them out over time, beginning with stopping new
  wood heater installations. “Providing financial support to help people switch
  to clean, efficient, electric alternatives is cost effective. Public education
  is vital – people need to understand the health risks and the benefits of
  going electric. Such government action is already happening with getting off
  gas – we need to get off wood too.” Johnston agrees, saying it’s time for
  governments to restrict the installation of new wood heaters in high-density
  residential areas where people will be affected by smoke pollution.
  “Point-of-sale legislation should be introduced requiring wood heaters to be
  replaced with non-polluting electric alternatives before a property changes
  hands.” She says while we have sophisticated systems in place for food and
  water standards, “the problem of wood heaters has persisted because no
  environment or health authority in Australia sees themselves as bearing
  primary responsibility” for it. Are there alternatives? While there are some
  wood burning heaters that produce less emissions than others, including this
  ultra-low emission model developed in New Zealand, Daniel says the emissions
  from those models may still be too high to be safe for health or the climate.
  “Those models were tested on NZ softwoods and not Australian hardwoods so the
  emissions will be greater here. All of these models still emit climate
  pollution and threaten our forests. We know the best alternative is for clean,
  electric split systems.” She says for those who want the cozy appearance of a
  roaring fire in their homes without the climate impacts, the best option is an
  electric fireplace. There are plenty of different kinds of systems on the
  market that offer the appearance of a warm glowing flame but without any
  emissions. These might not have the same romantic feel as wood, but you’ll be
  doing the climate – and your health – a favour.
