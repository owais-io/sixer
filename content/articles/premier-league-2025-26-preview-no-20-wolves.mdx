  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 16th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben
  Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 16th Prospects Wolves surely crave a campaign where relegation is
  off the menu. After a nightmarish start to last season, they turned to Vítor
  Pereira to pick up the pieces and the Portuguese reversed the direction of
  travel, in effect ensuring survival by mid-March. Wolves proved they could win
  without Matheus Cunha when the Brazilian missed four games through suspension
  in the spring and have retained André and João Gomes, a menacing pair of
  midfielders, but there will be pressure on Jørgen Strand Larsen to repeat an
  impressive first season in which he contributed 14 goals. The squad appears
  undercooked after another round of headline departures, with Cunha and Rayan
  Aït-Nouri who, combined, contributed to 59% of their 54 goals last season,
  departing for Manchester; Aït-Nouri played more minutes than any other Wolves
  player and of the five who played the most, three have left: Aït-Nouri, Cunha
  and Nélson Semedo. Fringe players have departed but Pereira wants a right-wing
  back to replace Semedo, the club captain who turned down a new contract in
  favour of a move to Fenerbahce, plus a striker and a midfielder. Wolves need
  the powerful Colombia winger Jhon Arias, a standout performer for Fluminense
  at the Club World Cup, to have an immediate impact. The mood surrounding the
  club is subdued, with supporters frustrated at the owner, Fosun, owing to a
  perceived lack of ambition heading into their eighth consecutive season in the
  top tier. A winless pre-season served to exacerbate concerns that they will at
  best stand still, and now Newcastle have Strand Larsen on their bottomless
  striker shortlist. The death of Diogo Jota, an integral part of the most
  successful period in the club’s recent history, also hit hard, with one member
  of the backroom staff attending Jota’s wedding and his funeral 13 days later.
  Wolves will pay tribute to Jota before their game against Manchester City on
  Saturday, a visit that will bring the return of Aït-Nouri and provide Pereira
  an indicator of how much work there is to do. The manager Hoisting Wolves
  clear of trouble means Pereira has plenty of credit and he further endeared
  himself to supporters by mixing with them in the city-centre Wetherspoon’s.
  His “first the points, then the pints” mantra ended up on a banner at
  Molineux. Pereira is 57 – only David Moyes is older – and his Premier League
  opportunity was a long time in the making. He previously had job offers from
  Arsenal, Everton, Crystal Palace and arch-rivals West Brom. Now Pereira
  believes he is ready to prove why he is among the best managers in the
  division. “If I’m in the right place to challenge myself, I can do magic,” he
  said. Off-field picture Wolves announced a five-man “football leadership team”
  in June, led by the director of football, Domenico Teti, who has reunited with
  Pereira, with whom he worked at the Saudi Arabian club Al-Shabab. Teti
  replaced Matt Hobbs, the sporting director, who was influential in
  recruitment. The finances are broadly thought to be healthy after another
  summer of high-profile sales. The chair, Jeff Shi, has confirmed he would like
  to redevelop the Steve Bull Stand – the oldest at Molineux. “The next plan is
  to try to change a bit there and build more areas for hospitality for more
  business clients to come and enjoy there,” said Shi. Star signing Wolves hope
  Fer López, who in joining from Celta Vigo has followed a path trodden by
  Strand Larsen, will be their next gem. The 21-year-old attacking midfielder, a
  £19.5m buy, has shown plenty of promise despite only seven starts in La Liga
  last season. Perhaps it should be no surprise López, tracked by Wolves for
  several years, appears to have settled quickly; in 2018, aged 14, the
  Madrid-born player lived in Suffolk for three months, boarding at a private
  school near Stowmarket, and he trained with Norwich, until they told him he
  was too small, and with Bacton United 89 in Suffolk. Stepping up There is
  excitement around Mateus Mané, who this summer signed his first professional
  contract after being formally promoted to Pereira’s squad. The England youth
  international, who made his Premier League debut against Brighton in May after
  training with the senior group towards the end of last season, has in effect
  been fast-tracked into the first team, bypassing the under-21s after
  registering seven goals and four assists for the under-18s last season. The
  Portugal-born forward, 18 next month, joined Wolves from non-league Rochdale
  18 months ago. He is eligible for Portugal and England and has made seven
  appearances for the latter’s under-18s. A Next Generation pick last year. A
  big season for … Ki-Jana Hoever, named after the former NFL player Ki-Jana
  Carter, has not featured in a competitive game for Wolves since March 2022 but
  the Dutchman is primed to begin the season at right-wingback. Hoever, who has
  spent the previous four seasons on loan, most recently at Auxerre, seized his
  opportunity in pre-season, impressing Pereira. The overriding sense earlier
  this summer was that Hoever’s days were numbered but Pereira has given the
  former Liverpool defender another chance. “I’m trying to do my best to take
  it,” he said last month. “I hope I can be important for the club.” Sasa
  Kalajdzic, the 6ft 7in striker, could add to his 14 appearances in old gold
  after several serious injuries.
