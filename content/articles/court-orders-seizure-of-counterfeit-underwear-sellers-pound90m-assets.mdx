  A self-styled clothing tycoon who sold counterfeit socks and pants while
  operating an extensive fraud ring will have all his UK assets seized after the
  Crown Prosecution Service won a court order to confiscate up to £90m worth of
  property and luxury cars. Arif Patel, 57, from Preston, Lancashire, who has
  been on the run since 2011, will have homes and business premises he owned
  taken from him after a confiscation order granted by a judge at Chester crown
  court on Thursday. His Ferrari 575 Superamerica will be sold at auction, as
  will property in Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
  Patel masterminded a gang that was convicted in 2023 of one of the UK’s
  biggest VAT tax frauds in HMRC’s history. In a sequence of trades known as
  carousel fraud, he moved goods between different companies, creating false
  export and import records that he used to claim back large sums from the tax
  authorities. Soon after the fraud was uncovered, Patel absconded to Dubai,
  where it is understood he has been ever since. Carousel fraud has netted
  criminals hundreds of millions of pounds in VAT fraud over recent decades and
  led to concerns about HMRC’s ability to protect from abuse the main tax on the
  sale of goods and services. There are also likely to be concerns about the
  length of time it has taken to secure the convictions, which resulted in a
  group of VAT fraudsters being tried in their absence, and the confiscation
  order, which has taken a further two years. During the trial, investigators
  showed how Patel’s operation stole millions of pounds through VAT repayment
  claims on false exports of textiles and mobile phones. Patel’s gang also
  imported and sold counterfeit clothes that would have been worth at least £50m
  had they been genuine. He has now been ordered to pay back £90.5m with the
  sale of his properties in Preston, London and overseas. Patel and his
  co-accused, Mohamed Jaffar Ali, 61, of Dubai, were found guilty in their
  absence of fraud and money laundering offences after a 14-week trial in 2023.
  They were sentenced in their absence to a total of 31 years in prison. The UK
  does have a formal extradition treaty with Dubai but legal commentators say it
  is not effective. Twenty-four other people were convicted during five trials
  between 2011 and 2014, and a total of 116 years and seven months’ imprisonment
  handed down. The convictions followed a joint investigation between HM Revenue
  and Customs and Lancashire police, which also secured jail sentences totalling
  more than 116 years for 24 other gang members. Richard Las, director of the
  fraud investigation service at HMRC, said: “Arif Patel lived a lavish
  lifestyle at the expense of the law-abiding majority but he will now lose the
  property empire he amassed from the proceeds of crime. “Our work never stops
  at conviction. For the last two years we’ve worked with police and CPS
  partners to secure one of the biggest criminal confiscations we’ve ever
  recovered. “Tens of millions of pounds of stolen money will now go back to
  directly to fund public services.”
