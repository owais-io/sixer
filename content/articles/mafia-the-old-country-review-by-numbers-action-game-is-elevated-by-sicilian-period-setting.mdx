  period setting

  Once upon a time, the industry was drowning in games like this. Single-player,
  story-led action experiences with a weekend’s worth of choreographed set
  pieces and an open world glazed with a fine mist of collectibles … But here in
  2025, the age of the Battle Pass and live service forever games, Hangar 13’s
  solo adventure about Sicilian crime families feels almost as dated as its
  1900s setting. In fact, The Old Country has few new ideas to contribute to the
  cover shooter genre, nor to the Mafia series itself. Hangar 13 already
  produced a remake in 2020 of the original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, but
  in this game it often feels like the studio’s remaking it yet again in a
  different setting. Both the storyline and structure of its individual missions
  seem to be at the very least giving a reverential nod of the fedora to that
  2002 title. Case in point: the “win a race to impress your Don” mission trope.
  This chapter was infamous in the original Mafia because the 1930s race cars
  were extremely hard to handle and the race was all but unwinnable, but it was
  also a sophisticated multi-stage mission structure full of sabotage, theft and
  unexpected double-crossings. Mafia: The Old Country simply has you riding out
  to a town where a race is due to take place, then tells you the Don needs a
  replacement rider and drops you into the saddle for an uneventful canter
  around a course that features no real challenge. Ten years ago, such a
  by-the-numbers experience would have been criticised, but right now the
  scarcity of games like this means you’re inclined to look past the basic
  mission design and enjoy its strongest assets instead: its story, and its
  sense of time and place. It’s 1904 and you are Enzo Favara, an unfortunate
  young man with no family to speak of who finds himself working down in the
  sulphur mines with his fellow carusi in their yellow-stained rags and shaven
  heads. After working conditions at the mine tip past horrific and into fatal,
  Enzo stands up to his sadistic employers and makes a powerful enemy in Don
  Ruggero Spadaro, the local “businessman” who owns the mine. Not to worry,
  though – after fleeing, he’s taken in by Don Torrisi, a rival of Spadaro’s,
  who appreciates the young man’s bravery and work ethic. You can see where this
  is going. What follows is your typical ascendancy through the ranks of a crime
  family, expressed through the medium of knife fights and old timey shootouts,
  in the era when reloading a pistol takes three to five days. Local businesses
  refuse to pay up. Workers go on strike. Bandits and rival families threaten
  your reputation. You journey to a locale that’s conveniently littered with
  waist-high cover, hunker down and set to them. In fairness to Enzo and his
  associates, missions aren’t always about all-out violence. At times you’re
  sneaking around, distracting guards by throwing coins and bottles to lure them
  away from your path. There’s a lot of riding horses and driving cars and
  plenty of expository chat to deepen the context of your actions either side of
  the fracas. These mechanics outside combat are not especially exciting, but
  this is a mafia game. It’s not trying to be a deep, systems-laden experience –
  it just wants to tell you a gangster story. And by the skin of its teeth, it
  succeeds in that endeavour. But it does so via premise rather than plot. The
  beats are predictable. The memorable moments aren’t clever lines of dialogue
  or dramatic denouements, but vivid historical details. Pheasants strung up in
  pantries, baskets of citrus fruit piled high in fields. Workers stamping on
  grapes in the Torrisi vineyard. Historically accurate recipes for spezzatino
  di maiale on kitchen counters. The Sicilian dialect peppered throughout each
  conversation (I heartily recommend going all-in and changing to Sicilian audio
  localisation with English subtitles). Here is a game that has done its
  research, and brought to life a geographical and historical setting previously
  unvisited by games. And done it so well that it proves to be Mafia: The Old
  Country’s saving grace. It’s hard to make the case that its knife fights and
  shootouts are anything more than functional, and its missions feel slightly
  too straightforward to befit a franchise once known for its sublime changes of
  pace. But even with those caveats in mind, it’s still absolutely worth playing
  for the richness of its setting, and the infectious enthusiasm it has for its
  grim subject matter. • Mafia: The Old Country is out now, £49.99
