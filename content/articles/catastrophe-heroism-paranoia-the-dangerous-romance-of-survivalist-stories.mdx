  The man who claimed to have coined the word “survivalist” called himself Kurt
  Saxon. The sinister godfather of survivalism was actually born Donald Eugene
  Sisco, a former journalist who spent the 1960s floating between far-right
  groups in California before deciding that none of them were serious enough.
  Sisco’s passion for making his own bombs, which he advocated using on student
  demonstrators, cost him the fingers of his left hand. He liked to say that he
  was the reincarnation of a soul whose previous lives included a Roman
  legionary, a Nazi stormtrooper and the revolutionary philosopher Thomas Paine.
  Survivalism, or prepping, is experiencing a boom, from Silicon Valley
  billionaires to users of the Reddit board r/collapse. Elon Musk’s entire
  career, for example, has been partly driven by apocalypse anxieties and his
  conviction that he alone can save the human race (details to be confirmed).
  The scenarios vary – climate catastrophe, renegade AI, another pandemic,
  nuclear war between authoritarian regimes – as do the responses. Some claim to
  be making rational preparations to survive in the event of civilisational
  collapse, while others seem unnervingly keen to see the world turned upside
  down. This can feel like a very 21st-century obsession, stoked by online
  conspiracy theories and the doomerism produced by 24/7 news, but Sisco was
  pioneering the doom business 50 years ago. During the 1970s, rising crime and
  soaring inflation convinced Sisco that America was headed for an almighty
  crash and that he had better be ready for it. In 1976, he launched a magazine
  called the Survivor, which offered subscribers an unnerving combination of
  tips on self-sufficiency (how to make candles, blow glass, grow cucumbers) and
  ghoulish predictions of a cataclysmic event known as Collapse Day. “America’s
  irreversible collapse should be apparent to anyone by 1980,” Sisco wrote in
  the first issue. In an interview, Sisco summed up the survivalist’s blend of
  excitement and genocidal misanthropy: “I’m quite thrilled by the prospect of
  civilization ending. It is an adventure and a great culling that has to come.”
  Yet despite Sisco’s claims, the word “survivalist” actually originated in
  fiction – specifically Giles Tippette’s 1975 novel The Survivalist. It is the
  story of Franklin Horn, a middle-aged man with similar, though less fascistic
  premonitions of doom to Sisco. Horn believes that the city he lives in is on
  the verge of collapse and tries to convince his wife and friends to join him
  in building a fortress in the Ozarks (where Sisco would move in 1980). “I’m
  not a humanist,” Horn says. “I’m a survivalist.” When they decline to sign up
  to his paranoia, he goes it alone and finds himself stalked by an antagonist
  who raids his supplies and tries to kill him. In fighting back, Horn realises
  that man cannot live alone in fear and shamefacedly rejoins the civilisation
  he rejected. Tippette repudiated in advance Sisco’s lurid fantasies of
  apocalyptic adventure. Novelists have been imagining the challenges of
  survival for decades. If survivalism can be seen as a form of storytelling
  that consumes the storyteller, then fiction can help us understand the
  mentality and the dangerous places it can lead. From Daniel Defoe’s Robinson
  Crusoe in 1719 to Ridley Scott’s movie The Martian almost 300 years later,
  audiences have been captivated by tales of resourceful individuals who find
  increasingly ingenious ways to survive a hostile environment until they can
  return to civilisation. They are adventure stories in which heroism consists
  of relentless problem-solving rather than conflict. The difference between a
  survivor and a survivalist is that one is a temporary condition and the other
  a permanent identity. The survivalist actively wants to be estranged from
  civilisation – craves, in fact, the destruction of civilisation itself. After
  all, it would be a waste of effort if society refused to collapse. In the
  1970s, some called themselves “retreaters”, having in effect resigned from
  society. Though framed as an ugly necessity (people would try to steal your
  stuff), violence was part of the appeal of this bare-knuckle libertarianism.
  The survivalist is not content with maintaining a vegetable patch and
  whittling a bow and arrow to hunt for food. He wants guns, and people to use
  them on. The survivor and the survivalist go head-to-head in William Golding’s
  1954 novel Lord of the Flies, about a group of schoolboys stranded on an
  island during a nuclear war. Their initial leader, Ralph, wants to preserve a
  skeleton of social norms and solidarity until help arrives. The fire he
  maintains is both a signal to rescuers and a symbol of civilised values: “The
  rules are the only thing we’ve got!” His challenger, Jack, however, turns
  himself into a tribal chieftain, exerting power through violence, barbarism
  and superstition. For him, catastrophe is liberation. Why would he ever want
  to go home again? Subsequent catastrophe novels such as John Christopher’s The
  Death of Grass (1956) and Charles Eric Maine’s The Tide Went Out (1958)
  proposed that most people thought of themselves as noble Ralphs but would soon
  turn into brutal Jacks once the going got tough. The fictional survivalist who
  first expressed the ominous politics of survivalism appeared in HG Wells’s
  1890s phenomenon The War of the Worlds. Amid the chaos of a Martian invasion,
  the narrator meets an artilleryman with a plan: humanity will regroup and
  rebuild in underground sewers and tunnels in order to wage guerrilla war
  against the invaders. The artilleryman is drooling with anticipation because
  he is a eugenicist and – 20 years before the fact – a fascist. He contrasts
  “able-bodied, clean-minded men” with the “weak and silly” who deserve to die:
  “It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.” Decades
  later, in a 1982 interview with the Sacramento Bee, Sisco argued that anyone
  with an IQ below 110 should be sterilised to save America from degeneracy.
  Survivalism went mainstream during the first half of the 1980s. Newspapers
  profiled survival businesses and the isolated communities they served, finding
  characters much like the artilleryman. Their lurid fears included nuclear war,
  foreign invasion, environmental disasters, race war and food shortages due to
  overpopulation. The sociologist Richard G Mitchell Jr spent more than a decade
  talking to survivalists for his 2002 book Dancing at Armageddon: Survivalism
  and Chaos in Modern Times. He found that most of them felt impotent and
  overwhelmed in their day-to-day lives and were empowered by imagining
  themselves the main characters in a greatly simplified world without rule of
  law – or WROL in survivalist parlance. “Survivalism,” Mitchell observed, “is a
  way to accomplish the creative renarration of the self and often one’s
  companions into tales of aesthetic consequence.” It gave their lives meaning.
  It was in 1981 that Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior popularised the hitherto
  obscure word “post-apocalyptic”. “Mad” Max Rockatansky is not technically a
  survivalist, because he never expected or wanted society to collapse. A former
  police officer, he sides with the vulnerable neomedieval community rather than
  the feral biker gang. But the movie inspired a more aggressively rightwing
  genre that the writer Mike Davis called “armageddonist”. That same year, Jerry
  Ahern began publishing The Survivalist, a series of pulp novels about John
  Rourke, a former CIA officer who battles Soviet invaders, mutants and
  cannibals in the aftermath of a nuclear war. Ahern published as many as four
  volumes a year (titles included The Doomsayer, The End Is Coming and The
  Savage Horde), which tells you something about their quality. More notable for
  the loving attention Ahern gives to various firearms (he later founded his own
  gun company) than for their characters or ideas, they sold millions of copies.
  At the same time, survivalism merged with the far-right militia movement to
  produce hundreds of real-life John Rourkes. The far-right, anti-government
  militia group the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord conducted an End
  Time Overcomer Survival Training School – and practised assassination skills
  on its 224-acre (91-hectare) armed compound in Arkansas – before one member
  killed a Black police officer and attracted the attention of the FBI. A
  related white nationalist group, the Order, murdered the Jewish radio host
  Alan Berg and was also shut down by the FBI – a story told recently in Amazon
  Prime’s The Order. All of this overt Nazism and homicidal violence made
  survivalism a dirty word, leading Sisco to insist that real survivalists do
  not shoot police officers. “A survivalist is simply one who anticipates the
  collapse of civilisation and prepares to survive it,” he protested. One
  peculiar product of this fraught period was The Survivors, a flop 1983 comedy
  starring Robin Williams as a paranoid dental supply executive who joins a
  survivalist camp in Vermont. A more serious one was David Brin’s 1985 novel
  The Postman. Brin’s hero, Gordon Krantz, dons a dead postman’s uniform and
  delivers his abandoned mail to bring a little hope and order to
  post-apocalyptic Oregon. His foes are a “loose, macho, hyper-survivalist”
  militia called the Holnists, whose antisocial savagery he blames for America’s
  desperate state: “It was the same solipsistic philosophy of ego that had
  stoked the rage of Nazism.” Brin was rebuking the violent, self-aggrandising
  survivalism that ran through post-Mad Max fiction and spilled over into real
  life via the Covenant and the Order. In The Postman, society is something
  priceless that should be mourned and rebuilt, not a sandcastle to knock down.
  After the militia movement was associated with atrocities such as the 1995
  Oklahoma City bombing, survivalism’s reputation sank further. But in 1998, one
  user of an internet message board about the Y2K bug introduced the synonym
  “prepper”. It sounded more modern and more reasonable than “survivalist”, with
  an emphasis on the practical details of preparation rather than daydreams of
  post-apocalyptic gunplay. The National Geographic series Doomsday Preppers,
  which launched in 2012, became the channel’s most watched show to date.
  Despite the rebranding, preppers are still usually treated as sinister or
  absurd in 21st-century fiction. Closer in spirit to Tippette’s The Survivalist
  than Ahern’s The Survivalist, these stories puncture what Brin called
  “little-boy wish fantasies about running amok in a world without rules”.
  Cormac McCarthy’s crushingly bleak 2006 masterpiece The Road is often praised
  on prepper websites but it presents survival as a gruelling slog rather than
  an adventure. “There were few nights lying in the dark that he did not envy
  the dead,” McCarthy writes of his unnamed protagonist. The most acclaimed
  episode of HBO’s The Last of Us meanwhile features a misanthropic survivalist
  (played by Nick Offerman) who admits: “I used to hate the world and I was
  happy when everyone died.” But his hard shell is cracked open when he falls in
  love with an unexpected visitor and is reminded that people matter after all.
  While Offerman’s character represents the old-fashioned hermit survivalist,
  other stories satirise the new billionaire preppers: people like Peter Thiel,
  who spend vast amounts of money on luxury bunkers, private islands or refuges
  in New Zealand. While traditional survivalism is a power fantasy for the
  powerless, this version is an escape route for elites who are partly
  responsible for the social and environmental instability that terrifies them.
  “Why do people who are envied for being so powerful appear to be so afraid?”
  asked the economist Robert A Johnson in the New Yorker. “What does that really
  tell us about our system?” They are retreaters. The popular suspicion of the
  survival industry dates back to the fallout shelter craze of the early 1960s,
  when The Twilight Zone showed neighbour turning on neighbour in The Shelter;
  Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove ranted about creating a postwar master race
  in the mineshafts; and Bob Dylan mocked bunker dwellers in his song Let Me Die
  in My Footsteps. The shelter business all but collapsed within a year when
  most Americans decided that not only would they probably not survive a nuclear
  war but that they would not want to. Subterranean shelters are ripe for parody
  once more. The recent satirical TV series Fallout, based on the hit video
  game, contrasts the suffocating conformism of the Vaults with the perilous
  freedom of the wasteland. In American Horror Story: Apocalypse, a billionaire
  socialite and her entourage shelter from a nuclear winter in the luxurious
  bunker Outpost 3 but the situation turns nightmarish as food supplies run out
  and paranoia flourishes. In season three of the post-apocalyptic sitcom The
  Last Man on Earth another socialite hides out from a pandemic in her dead
  friend’s well-appointed bunker and slowly loses her mind. Whether it is the
  menace of desperate companions, a sinister regime or maddening solitude, an
  apparent refuge becomes a prison to be escaped. We sympathise with Robinson
  Crusoe or Matt Damon’s character in The Martian because they have been
  forcibly estranged from the human race and are desperate to reconnect. But
  from the Ozarks compound to the New Zealand bunker, survivalists choose to
  sever themselves from humanity at large. No wonder we enjoy seeing them fail.
  All stories of catastrophe and survival contain a verdict on human nature.
  Most texts about survivalism, from prepper handbooks to The Road, promote a
  Hobbesian view of humanity: civilisation is a thin skin stretched over an
  abyss of animal brutality. “Men have always had urges towards dominance which
  are basically stronger than urges towards cooperation,” John Christopher said
  when asked about the pessimism in The Death of Grass. But is this true, or
  does survival fiction encourage us to believe the worst? While nobody knows
  what would happen if everything collapsed, Rebecca Solnit demonstrates in A
  Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities that Arise in Disaster
  that in the aftermath of real catastrophes the looters and marauders are
  vastly outnumbered by people trying to help and save each other. Far from
  being a liberal delusion, mutual aid is a powerful human instinct. “Everybody
  was your friend and you in turn everybody’s friend,” recalled one survivor of
  the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. “The individual, the isolated self was
  dead. The social self was regnant.” Whether for political reasons or simply
  the need for narrative excitement, conventional survival fiction endorses the
  idea, as David Brin put it, “that humanity in general is dreadful and
  therefore only individual heroes matter”. But in novels such as Pat Frank’s
  Alas, Babylon (1959) or Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven (2014),
  post-apocalyptic survival is achieved instead by solidarity and collaboration.
  Problem-solving is a collective endeavour and selfishness spells doom. These
  stories are worth telling, too, and they may be closer to reality. Dorian
