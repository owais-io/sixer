  The University of Sydney has removed a Palestinian flag hanging outside an
  academic’s office after accusing him of breaching its new flag policy. The
  13-page flag policy, revised in June and formerly referred to as flag
  guidelines, sets out the university’s requirements for flying and displaying
  flags and using university flagpoles. Under the policy, “unapproved flags”
  must not be flown permanently, including flags that represent unlawful
  activities, are inconsistent with university values, represent a political
  party or are considered to be “otherwise unsuitable”. Dr David Brophy, a
  senior lecturer in modern Chinese history, arrived on campus on Tuesday to
  find his flag, which had been hanging from an external window of a large
  campus building, had been taken. Prior to this, he had received an email from
  the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Prof Lisa Adkins,
  advising him the university was “aware of a flag” they believed he had
  displayed on the outer wall of the A18 Brennan MacCallum building. “We
  consider that the ongoing display of the flag is inconsistent with clause
  2.8(1) of the Policy which confirms that unapproved flags can be displayed in
  such areas on a temporary basis only,” Adkins wrote on 26 June. “To this end,
  we require you to remove the flag from the outer wall of the building by 4
  August 2025. Should the flag not be removed by this time, it will be removed
  by Central Operations staff and will be treated as lost property.” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The policy notes flags must not be flown from university
  infrastructure without approval from the brand team, and that “no structure or
  fixture may be attached to any building to allow a flag to be displayed
  without approval”. Staff will remove flags that are “unapproved”, considered
  “inappropriate, dangerous or offensive” or contravene “any university policy”,
  the policy notes. A breach of the rules can be considered as misconduct.
  Adkins noted in her email to Brophy that if he wished to continue to display
  the flag he could do so in a “non-shared indoor space”, or apply for approval
  to display the flag outside. After receiving the email, Brophy replied to
  Adkins, along with the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Mark Scott, saying
  his conscience “won’t allow me to comply”. “I go through the day now with
  gruesome images of emaciated children running through my mind,” Brophy wrote
  on Monday. “At a time like this, ethical obligations far outweigh any ad hoc
  institutional policies, particularly those transparently aimed at stifling
  opposition to an ongoing genocide. “I’d like you both to reflect on the moral
  weight of what you’re doing and withdraw the instructions to remove the flag.”
  Brophy told Guardian Australia he had received no “direct explanation” as to
  why “it’s such a bad thing to have this flag up”. The flag was removed when he
  was not in the office, he said, and as of Wednesday afternoon he was yet to
  receive a response to his email. “I’ve filed a lost property report, and I’m
  hoping security will be able to locate my flag,” he said. “I’d like to think
  the outer facing window of an office at a university was a place where some
  kind of display of opinion was still possible. “But the whole flag policy was
  introduced precisely in response to people like me hanging Palestinian flags …
  they’re hiding behind their policy to justify the action.” A spokesperson for
  the University of Sydney, who echoed the rules laid out in the email initially
  sent out to Brophy, said Palestinian flags had not been banned from campus and
  that the flag was removed from his office because “unapproved flags of any
  kind can only be flown from university infrastructure on a temporary basis”.
  “The flag is being held safely for collection,” they said. “We expect
  Palestinian flags to continue to feature on our campus, including as part of
  [Thursday’s] planned National Student Strike for Palestine.” The national
  president of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU), Dr Alison Barnes,
  said university leadership “should be standing with staff to defend and uphold
  these cornerstone principles, not introducing policies that undermine them”.
  Barnes said there had been increased reports “across the country” of new
  measures which had a “chilling effect on free speech and academic freedom at
  universities”. The University of Sydney introduced a string of new measures on
  protests after commissioning an external review into its processes, following
  the disbanding of a pro-Palestinian encampment, and amid concern from Jewish
  bodies, including the Australasian Union of Jewish Students (AUJS), that it
  had not adequately addressed antisemitism on campus. The measures, which
  initially proposed requiring three days’ notice for demonstrations and banning
  staff and students from holding banners on campus without prior permission,
  were criticised for what opponents argued were restrictions on freedom of
  speech. The three-day notice period was removed when the policy was revised in
  February, and the provisions on banners now apply only to those that are
  attached to the premises. The NTEU’s University of Sydney branch president, Dr
  Peter Chen, said the university’s new policies had “reduced freedom of
  expression, academic debate, and rights to industrial organising on campus”.
  Peter Wertheim, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry’s co-chief
  executive, said academics who displayed visible flags and political symbols on
  campus were not just making a statement about their own views. “They are
  deliberately confronting other people who share their working and learning
  environment with those views, even against their wishes,” he said. “Such
  coercive behaviour is a grounds for disciplinary action in most workplaces,
  and the same rules should apply at universities.” Wertheim said freedom of
  expression did not include the right to make campuses “threatening and
  exclusionary for other employees or impressionable students”. • This article
  was amended on 7 August 2025 to take account of changes to the university’s
  policies on protests since they were first drafted.
