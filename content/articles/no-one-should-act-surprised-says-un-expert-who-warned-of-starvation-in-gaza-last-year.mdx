  The UN expert who first warned that Israel was orchestrating a campaign of
  deliberate mass starvation in Gaza more than 500 days ago, has said that
  governments and corporations cannot claim to be surprised at the horror now
  unfolding. “Israel has built the most efficient starvation machine you can
  imagine. So while it’s always shocking to see people being starved, no one
  should act surprised. All the information has been out in the open since early
  2024,” Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, told
  the Guardian. “Israel is starving Gaza. It’s genocide. It’s a crime against
  humanity. It’s a war crime. I have been repeating it and repeating it and
  repeating it, I feel like Cassandra,” said Fakhri, referring to the Greek
  mythological figure whose warnings and predictions were ignored. On 9 October
  2023 – two days after the deadly Hamas attack – Israel’s then defense
  minister, Yoav Gallant, declared a “complete siege” of Gaza and said he would
  halt the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel. By December 2023, Gazans
  accounted for 80% of the people in the world experiencing catastrophic hunger,
  according to UN and international aid agency figures. Now, widespread
  starvation, malnutrition and disease are driving the sharp rise in
  hunger-related deaths across Gaza, with more than 20,000 children hospitalized
  for acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, according to the Integrated
  Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global initiative that provides
  real-time data on hunger and famine for the UN and aid groups. The “worst-case
  scenario of famine is currently playing out” across the Gaza Strip, the IPC
  warned in an alert earlier this week. Fakhri was among the first to warn about
  the impending famine – and the need for urgent action to stop Israel from
  starving 2 million people in Gaza. In an interview with the Guardian published
  on 28 February 2024, Fakhri said: “We have never seen a civilian population
  made to go so hungry so quickly and so completely, that is the consensus among
  starvation experts … Intentionally depriving people of food is clearly a war
  crime. Israel has announced its intention to destroy the Palestinian people,
  in whole or in part, simply for being Palestinian … this is now a situation of
  genocide.” The following month, the international court of justice recognized
  the risk of genocide in Gaza and drew attention to the “spread of famine and
  starvation”. The ICJ said that Israel must immediately take all necessary and
  effective measures, in cooperation with the UN, to ensure unfettered access to
  humanitarian aid including food, water, shelter, fuel and medicines. In May,
  the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and former defense minister
  Gallant became the first ever individuals to be formally accused by an
  international court of deliberate starvation, which is a war crime. In July
  2024, a group of UN experts including Fakhri declared a famine after the first
  deaths from starvation were reported in Gaza. Fakhri also published a detailed
  report for the UN into Israel’s decades-long control over food production and
  supplies to Palestinians, a stranglehold which meant 80% of people in Gaza
  were dependent on aid when Gallant announced the current siege in October
  2023. Yet there has been little or no action to stop Israel starving
  Palestinians, which it has achieved by systematically destroying local food
  production (greenhouses, orchards, farmland) and blocking aid – in violation
  of international law. According to Fakhri, this is why famine has now taken
  hold in Gaza. “Famine is always political, always predictable and always
  preventable. But there is no verb to famine. We don’t famine people, we starve
  them – and that inevitably leads to famine if no political action is taken to
  avoid it. “But to frame the mass starvation as a consequence of the most
  recent blockade, is a misunderstanding of how starvation works and what’s
  going on in Gaza. People don’t all of a sudden starve, children don’t wither
  away that quickly. This is because they have been deliberately weakened for so
  long. The state of Israel itself has used food as a weapon since its creation.
  It can and does loosen and tighten its starvation machine in response to
  pressure; it has been fine-tuning this for 25 years.” Despite stark images of
  skeletal Palestinians, the Israeli government and some of its allies have
  continued to insist that the hunger is the result of logistical problems, not
  a state policy. Last week Netanyahu said: “There is no policy of starvation in
  Gaza. There is no starvation in Gaza.” Unicef is among multiple aid agencies
  to confirm that malnutrition and starvation have escalated since early March
  2025 – when Israel unilaterally violated a ceasefire agreed after Donald Trump
  returned to the White House. Israel reinstated a total blockade after allowing
  some aid trucks in during the ceasefire, though UN agencies and charities on
  the ground said it was never enough to fully meet the needs of the starved,
  sick and weakened population. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an
  opaque logistics group backed by Israel and the Trump administration, began
  operations in May, with armed security provided by private contractors and the
  Israeli military. It was authorized to replace 400 UN distribution hubs with
  just four across Gaza, in response to unproven claims that international aid
  was being diverted by Hamas. The UN and hundreds of aid groups condemned the
  move as a weaponization of aid that violated long-established humanitarian
  norms. On 1 June, Israeli soldiers killed 32 people at GHF sites, and since
  then more than 1,300 starving Palestinians have been killed trying to access
  food. Israel has long sought to discredit and weaken the UN and other
  international mechanisms including the courts, which it sees as hostile to its
  ongoing de facto annexation of Palestinian territories, accusing them of
  antisemitism. “This is using aid not for humanitarian purposes, but to control
  populations, to move them, to humiliate and weaken people as part of their
  military tactics. The GHF is so frightening because it might be the new
  militarized dystopia of aid of the future,” Fakhri said. In a statement, GHF
  rejected the reports of Palestinian deaths as “false and exaggerated
  statistics” and accused the UN of not doing enough. “If the UN and other
  groups would collaborate with us, we could end the starvation, desperation and
  violent incidents almost overnight. We could scale up, add more distribution
  sites and ramp up direct-to-community delivery which GHF is piloting now,” a
  spokesperson said. The Israeli government did not respond to request for
  comment. The deaths from starvation and aid-hub massacres come on top of at
  least 60,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli bombs and tanks. Studies have
  concluded that the real death toll is almost certainly much higher, and Israel
  has continued to deny international researchers and journalists entry into
  Gaza. Fakhri and other UN experts have repeatedly urged member states and
  corporations to act to stop the bombs and famine by cutting financial and
  military aid and trade with Israel, as well as broad-based economic and
  political sanctions. “I see stronger political language, more condemnation,
  more plans proposed, but despite the change in rhetoric, we’re still in the
  phase of inaction. The politicians and corporations have no excuse, they’re
  really shameful. The fact that millions of people are mobilizing in growing
  numbers shows that everyone in the world understands how many different
  countries, corporations and individuals are culpable.” Fakhri argues that in
  light of the US persistent vetoing of ceasefire resolutions at the UN security
  council, it is incumbent on the UN general assembly to call for peacekeepers
  to accompany humanitarian convoys into Gaza. “They have the majority of votes,
  and most importantly, millions of people are demanding this. Ordinary people
  are trying to break through an illegal blockade to deliver humanitarian aid,
  to implement international law their governments are failing to do. Why else
  do we have peacekeepers if not to end genocide and prevent starvation?”
