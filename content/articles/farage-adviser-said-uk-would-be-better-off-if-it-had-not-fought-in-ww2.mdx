  An adviser used by Nigel Farage and others in Reform UK to boost their social
  media popularity has suggested that Britain would be better off had it stayed
  neutral in the second world war instead of fighting Nazi Germany. Jack
  Anderton, who ran Farage’s hugely successful TikTok account before helping
  Luke Campbell become the Reform mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire, also said
  the UK should not support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. In
  a post on his personal blog about Britain’s international standing, Anderton
  said that in a future world of “meritocracy”, the UK could “regain” former
  colonies such as Australia, Canada and South Africa. He added that the UK
  should copy the policy of mass incarceration carried out by El Salvador’s
  president, Nayib Bukele, widely condemned as an abuse of human rights.
  Anderton has never been employed by Reform but the 23-year-old established
  Farage on TikTok, where he now has 1.3m followers, before working closely on
  Campbell’s election campaign. He remains a central part of Campbell’s circle,
  and the mayor is known to have made efforts to get him on to his roster of
  staff, which have been thwarted because he cannot have political appointees.
  Anderton’s personal blog, titled Britain Needs Change, includes an entry from
  last year about what he called “a self-interested British foreign policy”,
  arguing that the only conflict in the last century that was in the UK’s
  interest was the Falklands war. “Trillions of pounds of British taxes have
  been spent in foreign lands in the pursuit of ‘democracy’, ‘human rights’ and
  ‘doing what is right’,” the post said. “More than a million British lives have
  been lost since WW1 in wars and battles that have never once been fought by
  British men, on this island.” Fighting in both the world wars ensured the UK
  was no longer a great power, he wrote: “We impoverished ourselves for decades,
  we didn’t finish paying the loans off to America until 2006. Our economy
  stagnated, we lost an empire, and we are pushed around by America. And
  Germany, a country we beat, has been richer than us since the 1970s.
  “Alternative history is interesting; if Britain had not fought in WW1 and WW2,
  it would not have had to rely on America for economic support, and it would
  have had the independence to act accordingly. Britain could have developed
  India, Cyprus, Fiji, Malta, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, the Bahamas, Australia,
  Canada, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand. In the coming meritocracy,
  perhaps Britain could regain some of these nations.” The same post also argues
  against providing support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion: “We are sending
  billions of pounds (that we cannot afford) to prop up a country that we have
  no allegiance to. Russia is not our enemy, they have not attacked Britain.”
  Anderton calls for a shake-up of the Foreign Office so that all decisions are
  made purely on the basis of whether or not they benefit Britain: “Instead,
  what we have are people who should be working for the UN or a charity rather
  than working in the British Foreign Office.” In another post from 2024, on
  crime, Anderton enthusiastically endorses the policies of Nayib Bukele, who
  has dramatically cut gang violence and wider crime through mass detentions
  that have put 2% of El Salvador’s population in prison. “Extraordinary times
  require extraordinary measures,” he wrote. “I’d even argue the measures aren’t
  that extraordinary and should be in place in times of normalcy. “El Salvador
  is perhaps a lesson for those in Britain who wish to take back control of
  their country. Power works, and it is all that matters. State power when used
  effectively is basically omnipotent. The meritocracy will be established,
  criminals and corrupt officials will be jailed, immigration will drop to zero,
  houses will be built, and our citizens will once again feel proud of the
  country they call home.” Anderton was contacted for comment. Campbell’s office
  referred the matter to Reform UK, who said Anderton was not employed by either
  the party or the mayor.
