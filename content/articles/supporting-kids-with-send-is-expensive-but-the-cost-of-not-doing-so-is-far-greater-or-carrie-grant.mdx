  Three of my four children have had full EHCPs. These are education, health and
  care plans, which means each child’s needs have been assessed and documented.
  They guarantee that appropriate provision to meet those needs has been agreed
  and must now be delivered by law. Well-written EHCPs are invaluable,
  particularly the legal part. Without it there would be no rigour, no
  meaningful challenge and, ultimately, no power to ensure that the right
  educational support is provided. Naturally, then, I was worried when earlier
  this year the government began discussing reforms, with the possibility of
  scrapping EHCPs. Ministers said they had inherited a system on its knees, with
  local authorities struggling to cope with the rising demand for support for
  children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). The
  government’s plans are due to be published in October, and I fear where they
  will leave children like mine. One of my children was diagnosed as autistic at
  the age of seven. They struggled in school for years, hitting academic targets
  but withdrawing into an isolated, fear-filled, friendless space, with daily
  meltdowns on their return home. The school failed to understand what was
  happening and as my child reached their teens, with pressure mounting, my
  husband and I began to fight on every front, attempting to get an EHCP, facing
  a tribunal, battling with a school that seemed to lack compassion and
  desperately trying to access therapy. As a result of societal pressure and our
  abject fear of the school attendance officer, we demanded more of our child –
  ordering, cajoling and begging them to come out of their bedroom and go to
  school. This went on for months until one day, they simply refused to go. A
  pattern of low attendance followed. The system had broken my child, and later,
  with an incident of massive self-harm, they let us all know that no one was
  listening. We sat for days in hospital on suicide watch. From time to time, my
  child would check their phone only to find bullying messages (up to 94% of
  autistic children are bullied). Something had to shift. We managed to get a
  simple (not full hours) EHCP, but it took so long to come through that it no
  longer applied to the child we were now faced with. Finally, two years later,
  a fantastic Send officer at our local authority took our case on,
  gold-standard provision was agreed and the impact was transformative. For
  instance, if our child couldn’t make it into school, the teaching assistant
  (TA) would come to our home and work with them. This created a safe bridge
  between school and home and led to them going into school almost every day.
  Another of our children, who is adopted and has complex needs, presented with
  very challenging behaviours at school and has experienced permanent
  exclusions. From those first incidents, it took more than two years to
  organise an EHCP and get them into an appropriate educational setting.
  Permanent exclusion has risen by 39% in English schools in the past two years
  and is common among children and young people with Send. When you consider
  that many thousands of children are waiting more than 20 weeks to get an EHCP,
  it makes sense that there are problems in classrooms. Another of our autistic
  children spent three years out of education between the ages of 11 and 14,
  waiting for an appropriate school within an hour of home. A private school for
  autistic children was eventually found, and our child has flourished. The
  school costs the local authority a lot of money, but without the EHCP our
  child could well have remained out of education. This often means taking a
  tax-paying parent out of the workforce as they become full-time carers, the
  child’s teacher, therapist and social circle. The outcome for these children
  is likely to mean no job, mental health issues and early death (autistic
  people are nine times more likely to die from suicide). The long-term cost to
  health and social care is great. These are just three examples of why EHCPs
  matter. If children do not have an EHCP they will often end up refusing to go
  to school. When a child responds with aggression and violence, they are
  letting the grownups know that school isn’t working. Without an EHCP, my child
  learned that a violent outburst meant they would be taken to a quiet space
  outside the classroom, which is exactly what they wanted. They were letting
  staff know that without help, the classroom was intolerable. An EHCP would
  have given my child an allocated, full-time TA and strategies and plans for
  help. Send children often experience unmet needs in school and with increasing
  mental health challenges (only 32% of those trying to access Child and
  Adolescent Mental Health Services are getting support) the challenges can
  escalate very quickly. I have attended a number of meetings where the
  government’s strategic adviser on Send, Christine Lenehan, has hinted at the
  scrapping of EHCPs. It always causes real fear among those present. To be
  clear, the vast majority of EHCPs are applied for by schools, not parents.
  Without them, teachers are set up to fail, their passionate vocational
  callings moving towards disillusionment. So far, their voices have not been
  heard in the argument. An Ofsted report shows that 30% of teachers are asking
  for more Send training. Teachers rely heavily on TAs in the classroom and one
  child’s EHCP may cover the cost of that extra staff member. We need to empower
  teachers and especially value our incredible TAs. Schools’ senior leadership
  teams need to create environments where all belong – staff and children – but
  they cannot do this if there is a lack of awareness, training and funding, and
  no legal mandate. With the current delays in issuing EHCPs, we clearly see the
  impact of their absence. Our children end up at home, out of school, with no
  social life, no education and most importantly, no sense of belonging. This
  affects their whole lives. They may never be part of the workforce or have a
  meaningful social circle. They may never take their place in society. The
  government has clearly taken into account the cost of EHCPs. Now it needs to
  focus on the cost of not providing them. Carrie Grant is a TV presenter and
