  Ham and bacon sold by supermarkets including Tesco, and Marks and Spencer
  still contain cancer-causing chemicals almost 10 years after the World Health
  Organization warned about the dangers of their use in processed meats.
  Wiltshire ham is the product with the highest concentrations of nitrites,
  according to analysis that compared it to cooked ham and unsmoked bacon. All
  of the 21 products tested in a laboratory were found to contain nitrites,
  which are used to preserve meat, despite the WHO in October 2015 declaring
  them to be unsafe. Tesco’s Wiltshire ham contained the most nitrites – almost
  33 milligrams per kilogram. That was 11 times the 2.88mg/kg in its cooked ham
  and almost four times the 8.64mg/kg in its unsmoked bacon. And it was also
  almost 18 times the 1.84mg/kg found in Morrisons’s bacon. Other Wiltshire ham
  products, including those sold by M&amp;S (28.6 mg/kg), Sainsbury’s
  (21.1mg/kg) and Morrisons (19.2mg/kg) also contained relatively high levels,
  although Asda’s version only had 8mg/kg. Food campaigners, who want nitrites
  banned, said the findings were “alarming”. Cancer charities said the
  widespread use of nitrites showed that people should eat as little processed
  meat as possible, such as ham, bacon and sausages, because consumption
  increases the risk of bowel cancer. Cancer Research UK estimates that 13% of
  the 44,100 cases of the disease diagnosed each year in Britain are linked to
  processed meat. The analysis was commissioned by the Coalition Against
  Nitrites and undertaken by Food Science Fusion, an independent company, and
  the laboratory experts Rejuvetech. However, it found the levels of nitrites in
  all 21 products were well below the 150mg/kg legal limit. A spokesperson for
  the Coalition Against Nitrites, which includes food safety experts, medical
  specialists and politicians from most of the UK’s major parties, said: “It’s
  nearly a full decade since the WHO classified nitrite-cured processed meats as
  a group one carcinogen and it is disappointing and alarming that we continue
  to see products on sale containing high levels of nitrites.” They added:
  “Consumers are increasingly aware of the dangers of nitrites in processed
  meats, yet they continue to be exposed to their risks.” Wiltshire ham contains
  such high levels of nitrites because during the production process the pork is
  injected with nitrates, as also happens with cooked ham. However, Wiltshire
  ham is then soaked in a bath of brine and nitrites, to give it its red colour
  and protect it from deadly bacteria. At that point a chemical reaction occurs,
  which turns nitrates into nitrites. Prof Chris Elliott, the food safety expert
  who led the government-ordered investigation into the 2013 horsemeat scandal,
  said the research confirmed that nitrites remained “unnecessarily high in
  certain UK meat products”. He added: “Given the mounting scientific evidence
  of their cancer risk, we must prioritise safer alternatives and take urgent
  action to remove these dangerous chemicals from our diets.” Several food
  firms, including Finnebrogue and Waitrose, have responded to mounting concern
  about nitrites by producing bacon that is free of them. Dr Rachel Orritt,
  Cancer Research UK’s health information manager, said: “Eating processed meat
  increases the risk of bowel cancer. Nitrites … can lead to cell damage, which
  is one of the ways that processed meat is linked to bowel cancer. The less
  processed meat you eat, the lower your risk of bowel cancer.” Dr Giota Mitrou,
  the director of research and policy at the World Cancer Research Fund, said it
  recommended “eating as little, if any, processed meat as possible”. A Tesco
  spokesperson said: “We follow all UK and EU requirements, alongside guidance
  from the UK Food Standards Agency, to ensure we get the right balance of
  improving the shelf life and safety of our products with limited use of
  additives. “The nitrites levels in all of our products, including our
  traditionally cured Finest Wiltshire ham, fall significantly below the legal
  limits in the UK and EU. “Nitrates and nitrites are an important part of the
  curing process for some meats and they are used to prevent the growth of
  harmful bacteria that cause serious food poisoning.” Andrew Opie, the director
  of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents
  supermarkets, said: “Food safety is paramount to our members and they
  implement strict policies with their suppliers to ensure all products comply
  with UK food legislation.”
