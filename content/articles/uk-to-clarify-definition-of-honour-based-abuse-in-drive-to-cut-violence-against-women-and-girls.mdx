  against women and girls

  Ministers are introducing a clearer legal definition of “honour”-based abuse
  in an attempt to catch more perpetrators and protect women and girls from
  violence and coercion. The law change is intended to improve how public
  services respond to “honour”-based abuse in England and Wales, and forms part
  of Labour’s plan for change, which includes a pledge to halve violence against
  women and girls. Teachers, police officers, social workers and healthcare
  workers will receive training to spot the signs of “honour”-based abuse and
  better support victims, while an awareness-raising campaign will encourage
  victims to come forward. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: “All forms
  of ‘honour’-based abuse are devastating crimes that can shatter lives. There
  is no ‘honour’ in them. For too long, these offences have often been
  misunderstood by professionals, resulting in victims not getting the support
  they deserve. “Today we are announcing measures to put an end to this and
  shining a light on this debilitating abuse. This marks a crucial step in this
  government’s landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls within
  a decade.” As part of the changes, the national centre for violence against
  women and girls and public protection is working with the police to improve
  how officers assess the risks posed by “honour”-based abuse offenders. The
  Home Office will also pilot a study looking at how widespread this crime is.
  Emma James, the national policing lead for “honour”-based abuse, said it was a
  “complex crime” that often happened within community or family networks,
  making it difficult for victims to speak out for fear of further threats,
  violence and isolation. “That’s why it’s so important that policing works
  closely with other agencies to identify abuse and protect victims at the
  earliest opportunity,” she said. Recent statistics showed that 2,755 offences
  related to “honour”-based abuse were recorded by the police in England and
  Wales, including killings, female genital mutilation and forced marriage.
  Figures published last year found that the number of “honour”-based abuse
  offences recorded by English police forces had increased by more than 60% in
  two years, thought to be due to more victims coming forward, as well as
  political polarisation. Earlier this year, the joint Home Office and Foreign,
  Commonwealth and Development Office forced marriage unit launched a new plan
  to improve support to victims of forced marriage and the professionals who
  help them. The measures have been backed by Karma Nirvana, which the
  government funds to run the national HBA helpline, and 22 other organisations.
  Natasha Rattu, the charity’s executive director, hailed the move as a
  “landmark moment” after years of campaigning for a statutory definition. “This
  step will mean victims are no longer overlooked but seen, heard and supported,
  while professionals are better equipped to act,” she said. Payzee Mahmod, a
  campaigner who is a survivor of child marriage and “honour”-based abuse, and
  whose sister, Banaz, died in an “honour”-based killing, added: “I know how
  vital it is that professionals from the police to social workers and teachers
  have the clarity and tools they need to recognise this abuse and act quickly
  to protect those at risk. This step represents meaningful progress towards
  better safeguarding and ensuring that survivors are properly seen, heard and
  supported,” she said. Yasmin Javed, whose daughter Fawziyah Javed was pushed
  off Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh, Scotland by her husband after learning she was
  pregnant and had planned to leave the marriage, said she was “pleased” the
  government had listened to calls from campaigners. “I hope that this will help
  many more people affected by HBA and ensure that the multiple perpetrators of
  this abuse are properly recognised and addressed,” she added. • The caption on
  this article was amended on 26 August 2025 to correctly identify Fawziyah
  Javed’s husband as the person who killed her.
