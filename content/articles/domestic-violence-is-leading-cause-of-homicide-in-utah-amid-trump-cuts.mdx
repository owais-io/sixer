  Domestic violence is the leading cause of homicide in Utah, according to an
  analysis of FBI and state data by a local news station in Salt Lake City. The
  investigation is based on intimate partner homicide data recently released by
  the state. The station, Fox 13, found that 51 – more than a third – of the 137
  homicides between July 2023 and January 2025 were the result of intimate
  partner or familial violence. The majority of the perpetrators were men, while
  the sexes of the victim were nearly evenly split, with 26 male and 25 female
  victims. This could be because in many cases, there were multiple victims,
  including a victim’s children, parents or siblings. For advocates, the
  findings are devastating, but not surprising, given that it’s mostly women who
  come through the doors of domestic violence response centers and shelters,
  fearing for their lives after being threatened by their partners, said Kimmi
  Wolf, the communications specialist for the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition
  (UDVC). “Their level of fear and violence, the danger, the apologies – the
  entire cycle and years of power and control – it’s clear that homicide for
  many of these clients is going to be in the near future,” she said. The
  homicide data was released as a part of a 2023 law that requires all police
  responding to a domestic violence call to administer a lethality assessment.
  The assessment includes questions about whether the romantic partner is
  jealous or controlling, or has threatened their partner with a weapon. The
  release also came less than a week after three police officers were shot, two
  fatally, while responding to a domestic violence call in Tremonton, about 70
  miles (113km) north of Salt Lake City. While groups such as the UDVC lobbied
  for the legislation, the new protocol has meant an increase in referrals to
  the state’s 16 already thinly stretched direct service providers that provide
  emergency housing and legal support, Wolf added. At the same time, the Trump
  administration made deep cuts to funding for victims of crime, and state
  legislators excluded $1.6m in new funding requested by the UDVC for programs
  dealing with the influx of new clients in need of help. These cuts are
  especially gutting for rural communities, many of which have just one service
  provider for hundreds of miles, Wolf said, and those who work in underserved
  communities of color, whose missions have been under attack due to the Trump
  administration’s crackdown on what it’s described as diversity, equity and
  inclusion (DEI) programs. “At the end of the day, underfunded service agencies
  lost more money,” Wolf said. “We were already at a crisis tipping point. Then
  for the federal monies to dry up, that was the crisis.” Fox 13’s investigation
  comes amid Donald Trump’s hyperbolic portrayal of crime in major American
  cities, deployment of the national guard in Washington DC, and threats to send
  them to other US cities where he claims crime and violence are out of control.
  Noticeably absent from his comments, Wolf said, are conversations about what’s
  happening in states like Utah, where the greatest risk of homicide doesn’t
  come from a stranger on the street but from someone who’s claimed to love you.
  “We’re always afraid of these faceless criminals that are gonna jump out at us
  and cause us harm. But you’re more likely to be harmed by someone you know,”
  Wolf said. “It’s the woman who is at risk in her own home that is in danger
  from her spouse. We don’t want to admit that,” she continued. “It’s so easy to
  think of other people being the source of crime, not people in our own homes.”
