  The news Steve Parish was dreading arrived less than 24 hours after he basked
  in the glory of watching Crystal Palace win their second trophy in three
  months. Parish had been confident that the club’s appeal against their
  demotion from the Europa League would succeed as he discussed their prospects
  at Wembley Stadium after beating Liverpool in the Community Shield on Sunday.
  “I really am, even more after Friday,” the club chair said. “I don’t
  understand that we cannot be in the competition. I really can’t. But it’s up
  to the judges to decide. We trust them and that they listened to everything we
  said so let’s see.” Confirmation from the court of arbitration for sport that
  it had upheld the decision made by Uefa’s club financial control body to
  punish Palace for breaching its multi-club ownership rules has brought Parish
  and the team’s fans back to earth. The Cas statement made clear the role of
  John Textor, the American businessman who last month sold his 44.9% stake in
  Palace to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, was decisive. Textor has
  admitted that seconds after Palace’s victory against Manchester City in the FA
  Cup final in May that he feared the worst regarding participation in the
  Europa League, given that he owns Lyon, who also qualified. The Cas panel –
  consisting of a Dutch former striker, a Swiss former fencer who competed in
  the 1984 Olympics, and an Italian professor – backed Uefa’s findings that
  Textor “was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time
  of Uefa’s assessment date”. It also dismissed Palace’s argument that they had
  received unfair treatment compared to Nottingham Forest and Lyon, and said
  missing the 1 March deadline for Textor to place his shares into a blind trust
  had been crucial. Textor has been the target of most Palace fans’ frustration,
  although several have also taken aim at the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos
  Marinakis. Forest, who are poised to take Palace’s Europa League place, wrote
  to Uefa a few weeks after the FA Cup final expressing concern that Palace may
  have contravened multi-club ownership regulations. Parish suggested last month
  in an interview with Gary Lineker that their Premier League rivals had played
  a role in the decision to ban them. “We were told that and I think it’s been
  made public,” he said. “These things seem to be played out in public. There
  doesn’t seem to be a lot of confidentiality that comes out of certain
  organisations. But we’re led to believe that’s the issue – if there wasn’t
  somebody that wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn’t be a
  problem. “People have got to look at themselves. Some people will say it’s
  fine, some people will say it’s not. I don’t really have control of that. I
  only have control of the arguments that we put forward to Uefa.” Forest
  declined to comment on Parish’s remarks at the time. Palace’s case is believed
  to have included evidence that only members of the European Club Association
  were informed Uefa’s 1 March deadline for complying with multi-club rules
  could be extended until 31 May – a fact that enabled Marinakis to place Forest
  into a blind trust when it seemed they might qualify for the Champions League
  along with his Greek club, Olympiakos. Palace are also understood to have
  highlighted the burgeoning friendship between Marinakis and Textor. The
  American denies that had any bearing on his conduct and described as untrue
  reports he is planning to incorporate his Brazilian club Botafogo into the
  Greek shipping magnate’s network of clubs. Forest sent a legal delegation to
  the Cas hearing to argue their case and they have been silent since Palace
  were demoted by Uefa last month. Marinakis has resumed control of shares in
  the two-time European champions after they finished seventh in the Premier
  League. Their supporters can look forward to the Europa League’s league stage
  while Palace prepare for a Conference League playoff against the losers of the
  Europa League qualifier between Norway’s Fredrikstad and Midtjylland. The
  Danish side lead 3-1 going into their home leg on Thursday. It is estimated
  demotion will cost Palace up to £20m in lost revenue, given the Conference
  League’s league stage has two fewer games than the Europa League’s, although
  Oliver Glasner will fancy his chances of winning a competition that has had
  two English winners in its first four editions. The chance for Palace to play
  in Europe for the first time since a short-lived Intertoto Cup experience in
  1998, when they qualified after being the only English team to apply for
  entry, will be consolation for a club that also missed out in 1991 when they
  finished third in the First Division. Only the top two went into Europe via
  league position.
