  The drunk, the brainless and the idle enjoyed this. They had said they
  wouldn’t sing, but the best nights aren’t planned they just happen, and in the
  end it was their kind of night. Chaotic, wild, a lot wrong but alright, like a
  picture of who they are, sticking it to the man up here and down there. Packed
  into crumbling, filthy stands, Rayo Vallecano’s fans didn’t see their team get
  a deserved victory against Barcelona on Sunday but on a torn-up, dried-out
  pitch with not much grass, in a ground where VAR became the latest thing to
  fail, they did watch them fight and do it their way too, flying into the team
  with a budget 18 times bigger as if they weren’t big at all. “Fantastic,”
  Hansi Flick called them. It started as a protest and never stopped being one
  but it became something else too, something fun; they had been infuriated,
  worn down over years, and then they had been insulted but they couldn’t help
  but enjoy themselves, protest and party in one. Three days after Rayo had
  definitively qualified for the Conference League the team that is not just in
  the neighbourhood but of the neighbourhood almost comically incongruous in
  Europe, Rayo’s supporters announced they were going on strike. Rayo’s players
  meanwhile laid into the treble winners, worthy of more than the 1-1 draw it
  finished. But for a Lamine Yamal penalty which the broken video assistant
  system couldn’t correct, they might have got it. But for goalkeeper Joan
  García they definitely might. Because if Rayo’s team are good that line needs
  a somehow in there somewhere; the club could hardly be worse. As winger Álvaro
  García has put it: “Sometimes you think: ‘How are we where we are with what we
  have?’” What they have is a mess, mostly. An institution falling apart, a club
  where the captain hands over the armband in protest over the treatment of
  staff; where they can’t use the training ground; where the stadium fails
  building inspections, where plug sockets sit open, wires exposed; there is
  bird shit everywhere; seats are broken, toilets overflow; taps don’t work. And
  if there is something almost gloriously bad about it, enjoyably unique, it is
  also just bad. There is a risk of glorifying poverty and grime, and indulging
  failings as authenticity. As the statement from supporters this week put it:
  yes, they’re humble; yes, they celebrate their barrio with its consciously
  working class, left-wing identity and luxury isn’t their thing. Yes, they love
  this place, but that doesn’t mean they have to live like this. Worst of all is
  the feeling that it is not by accident but design, the way the owner and
  president Raúl Martín Presa wants it. He certainly wants to go to a new
  ground, paid for by the local government, a decision the coach Iñigo Pérez,
  speaking for everyone else, says would be “devastating”. The suspicion lingers
  this is a classic case of running the place down as a prelude, a justification
  to a move to somewhere he can make his own in a way the current ground never
  will be. The idea of Vallecas being inadequate for Europe is one he has
  embraced and echoed, opportunity presented as obligation. The pitch is so bad
  as to be suspicious. It is municipal, but the tenant has done nothing to care
  for it. Presa, at the other end of the political spectrum to supporters proud
  of their working class, left-wing identity, has always seemed to despise the
  fans and the feeling is mutual. Communication is almost entirely reduced to
  abuse. At every game, the entire ground sings for him to leave. That he hangs
  on can feeling genuinely baffling at times. Graffiti round the ground demands
  he go. Former coach Míchel Sanchez, the barrio’s most beloved son, has
  publicly called him out, saying he has never belonged. This weekend that
  divide could not have been laid more bare. When supporters’ groups came
  together to announce “enough is enough”, complaining about the way the club
  had fallen into abandonment, Presa responded by claiming this was just the
  Bukaneros, Rayo’s ultras behind the goal; they had forced other fans into
  backing them, acting like mafiosos. He called them – his club’s own fans –
  idle, brainless and drunkards, saying they didn’t respect their partners. They
  are, he claimed, the opposite of the values of the neighbourhood. His
  “evidence”? Their song, A Pirate’s Life, all yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum, a
  woman in every port, but should I ever marry it will be the girl who’s Rayo.
  No work, no study, every day instead spent aboard the Santa Ines. “They talk
  about working class but working class is breaking your back every day,” Presa
  said. In the middle, the team and its manager,” Pérez, says. And while careful
  about how he expressed it on Sunday night he said: “The fans have their
  reasons. My family are in the stands and they see the deterioration, that
  things could be better.” So on Sunday the first protest began, quietly broken
  by chants for Presa to go, which grew in intensity. As the first half went on,
  the banners came out one by one, each with a reason to oppose him, a megaphone
  explaining them: “for abandoning our stadium”; “for never listening to the
  fans”; “for mistreating the women’s team”: “for abandoning the youth academy”;
  “for refusing to sign the [reciprocal] ticket agreement”; “for dressing the
  stadium in mourning”. The 10th of them had just gone up when Barcelona were
  given the penalty with which they took the lead, Lamine Yamal falling in the
  area before then taking the kick himself. “I think the ref will have a look,
  nothing will happen … and that’s when we found out there was no VAR,”
  full-back Pep Chavarría said. Before the game, referee Mateo Busquets Ferrer
  had taken Flick and Pérez to one side and told them that the VAR technology
  wasn’t working, but they were trying to fix it. Over on the touchline, Pérez
  the coach was going crazy, kicking the iPad by the bench. “I’m ashamed,” he
  said, although perhaps the league should be more ashamed. “I lost the plot; I
  broke a screen, I spoke badly to the fourth official and I should have been
  sent off.” The issue, he said, was not so much that VAR didn’t work but that
  “it didn’t, then it did, then it didn’t again, then it did: yes, no, yes, no”
  – players not knowing how to respond. “That influences the game,” he said.
  “And, hey, look, the [technical] error might well be Rayo’s; it wouldn’t
  surprise me.” As the teams waited in the tunnel for the second half, Isi
  Palazón told his teammates that the referee, by then able to see a replay, had
  admitted he got it wrong. “It honours him that he said so,” Isi said
  afterwards. “I was so angry when it happened and I could say terrible things,
  speak ill of him, but I won’t. He’s a person.” Rayo weren’t, though, going to
  let this go, Vallecas alive, volume rising, supporters driven by another
  injustice, protests coming together as one. Driven above all by their team.
  Rayo had played well in the first half, García making the first superb save.
  Now they were on fast forward, every challenge an appeal, every attack a
  threat, everything frantic. And, above all, great fun. “It was chaotic,”
  Frenkie de Jong said, and that is the way they like it. Organised chaos,
  Andoni Iraola likened it to, and he preferred more chaos to more control.
  Pérez, his assistant, denied a work permit by the UK home office, has taken
  that on, volume over precision, no bus parking. He had also, Isi said, seen
  what he called the “Flick Line”, Rayo’s players pouring into the space behind
  the Barcelona back line. The team that beat Xavi Hernández twice, that got
  Ronald Koeman the sack, now took Flick to the edge. And when Fran Pérez, the
  only new player to cost anything this summer at €1m, slipped into what he
  called “the binman’s zone” at the back post and smashed a side-footed volley
  in off the bar, they had deserved it. They had deserved more, Joan García
  making a couple of sensational saves, Isi delivering an outrageous assist for
  Jorge de Frutos for one of them. “We played aggressive football, we didn’t
  stop, we kept going forward,” Chavarría said. “The manager was very clear
  about how we could hurt them and we carried that out to perfection; we made
  loads of chances and deserved all three points.” Flick said: “It’s amazing the
  work Peréz has done with them; they’re very intense.” At the end, they stood
  before the fans in the end, communion complete. They had come to have their
  say; the president had called them idle, drunkards and brainless but players
  and fans had a ball. “At the moment, I’ve got a slightly bitter taste. I think
  we deserved to win but in in a few hours’ time we’ll be pleased with what we
  have done,” Pérez said. Outside, way after midnight the fans waited by the
  gate for the players. nside the banners still hung across the stand.
