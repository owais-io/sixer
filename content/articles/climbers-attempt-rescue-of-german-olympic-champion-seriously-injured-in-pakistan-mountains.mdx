  A team of climbers are due to launch a rescue mission for the German double
  biathlon champion Laura Dahlmeier days after she was seriously injured by a
  rockfall on a mountain in northern Pakistan. The accident happened at around
  midday on Monday at an altitude of 5,700m on Laila Peak in the Karakoram
  range, according to a statement from Dahlmeier’s team. The 31-year-old was
  “hit by falling rocks” and no one had yet been able to reach her due to the
  danger of further rockfalls and the site’s “remoteness”. Her climbing partner
  was able to sound the alarm after reaching safety. “It was determined that a
  helicopter rescue is not possible,” said Areeb Ahmed Mukhtar, a senior local
  official in Ghanche district where the more than 6,000m (19,700ft) mountain is
  located. “The conditions at the altitude where she was injured are extremely
  challenging, and a team of foreign climbers will launch a ground rescue
  mission today.” Shipton Trek &amp; Tours Pakistan, which organised the
  expedition, confirmed the ground rescue on Wednesday by a team of four that
  includes three Americans and a German mountaineer. A helicopter managed to fly
  over the location and rescuers saw that “the experienced mountaineer is at
  least seriously injured”, it said. “No signs of life were detected.” Muhammad
  Ali, a local disaster management official, told AFP that weather conditions
  have been “extremely harsh” in the region for the past week, with rain, strong
  winds and thick clouds. Dahlmeier, an experienced mountaineer, had been in the
  region since the end of June and had already ascended the Great Trango Tower.
  The International Biathlon Union said it was “thinking of Dahlmeier and her
  family, hoping for good news to emerge soon”. She has won seven world
  championship gold medals, and at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang she
  became the first female biathlete to win the sprint and the pursuit at the
  same Games. Dahlmeier retired from professional competition in 2019 at the age
  of 25. She went on to become a commentator on biathlon events for German
  broadcaster ZDF, and also took up mountaineering. She is a certified mountain
  and ski guide and an active member of the mountain rescue, according to her
  team.
