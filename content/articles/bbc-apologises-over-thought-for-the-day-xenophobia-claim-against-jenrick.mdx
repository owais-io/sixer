  The BBC has apologised and retrospectively edited a segment of Radio 4’s
  Thought for the Day after the head of a refugee foundation described comments
  by Robert Jenrick about asylum seekers as “xenophobia”. The remarks by Krish
  Kandiah, a theologian who heads the Sanctuary Foundation, prompted an angry
  response from Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary. The BBC said it had
  removed “some of the language used” by Kandiah from a version posted online,
  saying it was not appropriate for the faith-based radio segment. However, Alf
  Dubs, a Labour peer who came to the UK as a child refugee, said he believed
  xenophobia was an accurate description of Jenrick’s comments in the Mail on
  Sunday last weekend in which Jenrick said the arrival of asylum seekers on
  small boats made him fear for his daughters’ safety and that he would not want
  them as neighbours. Speaking on Wednesday’s episode of the Today programme,
  Kandiah quoted from the Mail on Sunday. “[Jenrick] said: ‘I certainly don’t
  want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who
  broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing.’ These
  words echo a fear many have absorbed. Fear of the stranger. The technical name
  for this is xenophobia.” He said such fears were irrational and that most
  arrivals on small boats were fleeing “war, persecution and famine”. Kandiah
  argued there was no evidence that migrants posed a greater danger to children
  than others, noting that most offences against children were committed by
  people they already knew. While the segment was cleared in advance, it is
  understood that BBC staff decided to review the programme and edit the
  language without being prompted by an external complaint. The corporation then
  apologised to Jenrick. In his Mail on Sunday article, Jenrick listed a series
  of crimes, including sexual offences, in which the suspects were migrants,
  saying: “It’s no wonder fair-minded people are furious.” He wrote: “When I see
  these stories, I can’t help but think that it could have been one of my three
  young daughters. I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood
  with immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally, and
  about whom we know next to nothing. And I don’t want anyone else’s family to
  have this forced on them either.” He added: “My eldest daughter is 14 and
  already I worry about her safety as she starts to do things independently.
  It’s challenging enough without this to contend with.” Shortly after Thought
  for the Day was broadcast, Jenrick posted on X: “On BBC Radio 4 this morning
  listeners were told that if you’re concerned about the threat of illegal
  migrants to your kids, you’re racist. Wrong. You’re a good parent.” Kandiah is
  understood not to have been banned by the BBC from returning on the show. It
  is believed that his intention was to make inclusive points about community
  cohesion and welcoming the stranger and that he is distressed about the row. A
  BBC statement said of the item: “While its reflection on fear in society from
  a faith perspective is broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the
  Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its
  inclusion.” Items for Thought For The Day are approved by two BBC staff, the
  producer working on the item and someone else more senior, although the latter
  group can be very busy, with decisions potentially delegated. Contributors
  accept that they should avoid party political points. Tina Beattie, a Catholic
  theologian and fellow Thought for the Day contributor, said she agreed with
  Kandiah’s comments “but perhaps it would have been wise to avoid referring to
  a particular politician. Sometimes, one can trust people to make the
  connections without naming names”. She added: “Thought for the Day presenters
  have to tread a narrow tightrope. As the only slot on the Today programme with
  no right of reply, it’s vital to maintain balance and to avoid partisan
  politics, while trying not to be banal or platitudinous. “It takes many hours
  to produce the short script, working with producers who in my experience are
  highly professional and understand the boundaries and restrictions around what
  can and can’t be said.” Lord Dubs, who came to the UK from Prague, said: “I
  think anything that encourages hostility and is undermining mutual respect,
  undermining compassion, is xenophobic in its intent and xenophobic in its
  consequences. And that’s not the sort of thing we would expect a senior
  politician in the Tory party to be talking about. “I think it’s a shabby
  comment and it’s very dangerous, because what it does do is to lessen the
  likelihood of local communities being supportive of refugees.” The row comes
  amid rising tensions over asylum accommodation, with protests held outside
  hotels housing migrants and refugees. There were demonstrations in Epping,
  Essex, after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with a sexual offence
  against a schoolgirl. Additional reporting by Harriet Sherwood
