  Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) copied and
  uploaded sensitive Social Security Administration (SSA) data to a vulnerable
  cloud server, potentially risking the safety of hundreds of millions of
  Americans and violating federal privacy laws, according to a whistleblower
  complaint filed on Tuesday. The complaint from Charles Borges, the chief data
  officer at the SSA, alleges that Doge staffers effectively created a live copy
  of the entire country’s social security data from its numerical identification
  system database. The information is a goldmine for bad actors, the complaint
  alleges, and was placed on a server without independent oversight that only
  Doge officials could access. “These actions constitute violations of laws,
  rules, and regulations, abuse of authority, gross mismanagement, and creation
  of a substantial and specific threat to public health and safety,” the
  complaint states. The whistleblower complaint, first reported by the New York
  Times, is one of the most high-profile insider accounts of how Doge staffers
  have allegedly taken confidential government information and used it for their
  own ends, at great risk to the public. The database that Doge officials
  allegedly uploaded to the cloud contains highly personal information about
  hundreds of millions of US citizens and residents. It includes details such as
  names, place and date of birth, race and ethnicity, names of family members,
  phone numbers, addresses and social security numbers. The Social Security
  Administration denied that the sensitive data had been compromised and stated
  that it takes all whistleblower complaints seriously. “SSA stores all personal
  data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect
  vital information. The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a
  longstanding environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet,” an SSA
  spokesperson said. “We are not aware of any compromise to this environment and
  remain dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.” The non-profit
  Government Accountability Project whistleblower organization is providing
  Borges legal counsel in the case and filed his complaint with the US Office of
  Special Counsel, as well as members of Congress. The complaint calls on
  lawmakers to swiftly take action to safeguard public data and provide more
  oversight. “Placing a live copy of Americans’ social security data in a cloud
  environment without independent oversight puts everyone with a social security
  number and their families at real risk of identity theft, interrupted
  benefits, and tax or medical fraud that can follow them for years,” said
  Andrea Meza, director of advocacy and strategy at the Government
  Accountability Project and the legal counsel on the case. Borges is a career
  civil servant and navy veteran who joined the SSA in late January, and was
  previously chief data officer for naval air systems command. His complaint
  alleges that he repeatedly raised concerns with his superiors about Doge
  officials improperly accessing data but that no action was taken. “Mr Borges
  spent weeks pressing for fixes inside SSA; when nothing changed, he used the
  protected channels federal whistleblower law provides,” Maza said. “We’re
  calling for immediate oversight and an independent audit to investigate these
  violations, prevent future problems, and restore required safeguards.”
  Lawmakers and ethics watchdog groups, as well as former and current federal
  employees, have long accused Doge of accessing government data with a wanton
  disregard for security protocols and transparency. A separate whistleblower
  disclosure in April raised concerns that Doge employees had potentially
  exposed sensitive National Labor Relations Board information, and alleged it
  appeared that Doge employees attempted to cover up documentation of what data
  they accessed. As Doge rapidly embedded its staffers across federal agencies
  earlier this year, it gained access to troves of information from a wide swath
  of government databases. Although reports have detailed how the agency is
  using some of that data to further the Trump administration’s immigration
  crackdown, there has not been a full accounting of why Doge has accessed the
  public’s data.
