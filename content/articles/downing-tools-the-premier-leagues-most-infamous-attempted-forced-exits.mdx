  Following Alexander Isak’s decision to post an incendiary message on Instagram
  as part of his increasingly bitter attempt to force an exit from Newcastle, we
  look at how some others Premier League players have tried to inflict bitter
  breakups on their employers. Some were successful, some were not. Pierre van
  Hooijdonk Van Hooijdonk led Nottingham Forest to Premier League promotion in
  1997-98 by scoring 29 goals in 42 league games. Yet where there should have
  subsequently been optimism, things soured as the Netherlands striker became
  increasingly upset with the club’s inability to strengthen in the market,
  while also selling key players in Kevin Campbell and Colin Cooper. He returned
  to the Netherlands in August after a transfer request was turned down, going
  on strike to display his irritation. Van Hooijdonk stayed fit by training with
  his former club NAC Breda, eventually returning to the City Ground in November
  to end the standoff. Forest finished bottom, were relegated and did not return
  to the Premier League for 23 years. William Gallas Chelsea released a
  statement claiming Gallas had threatened to score own goals if was selected
  for the 2006-07 season opener against Manchester City and refused to play in
  an FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool as part of his attempts to leave the
  club, which he ultimately did on deadline day in September 2006, sealing a
  move to Arsenal. The Frenchman denied Chelsea’s accusations, saying: “If
  people want to hide behind false accusations in order to give a reason for why
  I left so they can calm down the club’s supporters then they can.” Whatever
  the case, the defender got his way, with his switch to the Emirates allowing
  Ashley Cole to travel in the opposite direction. Dimitar Berbatov Berbatov
  wanted to live his “dream” of moving to Manchester United, but there was a
  problem: Tottenham did not want to sell him. Juande Ramos, the Spurs manager,
  called in Berbatov for a meeting to discuss the Bulgarian’s future and it
  resulted with him being left out of the squad for a 2-1 defeat by Sunderland
  in August 2008. Ramos said the striker was not “focused enough” and would not
  “be good for the dressing room and the team effort”. Berbatov eventually got
  his way and a £31m deal was agreed with United, allowing him to make his
  much-desired move to Old Trafford on deadline day. Carlos Tevez The problems
  for Manchester City began when Tevez did not fancy warming up in a Champions
  League game at Bayern Munich in September 2011, subsequently feeling the full
  wrath of the manager, Roberto Mancini, who had no hesitation in declaring the
  Argentinian “finished” at the club. The two had never been close but the spat
  ended the relationship for good, with fuel thrown on to the bonfire by Tevez’s
  agent. “What is he apologising for?” Kia Joorabchian asked. “It’s almost like
  a false: ‘I’m sorry.’ He doesn’t believe, deep down, that he did anything
  wrong.” Tevez’s elected sabbatical in Argentina cost him £9.3m. In February he
  came back and apologised after a move to one of Milan, Inter and Paris
  Saint-Germain failed to materialise. Peter Odemwingie Sometimes it is best to
  take the route-one approach, unless, that is, there are TV cameras around and
  your desired transfer does not go through. Few will forget the sight of
  Odemwingie parked outside Loftus Road as he tried to seal a move from West
  Brom to QPR on deadline day in 2013. The Nigerian assumed a deal had been
  agreed but, unfortunately for him, that was not the case, leaving him with
  little else to do but chat with Sky Sports News via the window of his car
  before eventually driving back to the Midlands. “It was hard because I was
  angry and it was a really tough period to go through,” Odemwingie said as he
  recounted the incident to the Guardian in 2024. “It was very embarrassing in
  many ways.” Saido Berahino Berahino was hot property after scoring an
  impressive 20 goals for West Brom in the 2014-15 season. Mauricio Pochettino
  was desperate to bring the striker to Tottenham and two offers were made, both
  subsequently turned down by West Brom’s chairman Jeremy Peace. Berahino
  reacted by tweeting he would never play for Peace again before going on
  strike. He was clearly desperate to join Spurs, but his furious attempts at
  doing so did not work. West Brom, and Peace in particular, dug in, and the
  player remained where he was, eventually moving to Stoke in 2017. The
  32-year-old is currently unattached after a spell in Slovenia with Tabor
  Sezana. Any interest, Thomas Frank? Dimitri Payet Payet is proof that downing
  tools can speed up a player’s exit. The Frenchman wanted to leave West Ham in
  January 2017 in order to complete a move to Marseille, so stopped coming to
  training and refused to play for a club where he had been the undoubted star
  during the previous season. Payet’s teammates did not like his attitude, so
  kicked him out of their WhatsApp group, while Slaven Bilic, West Ham’s manager
  at the time, made it clear that Payet was still part of his plans. “We do not
  want to sell him,” he said. “We have said hundreds of times that we do not
  want to sell our best players. We want to keep them.” None of that made a
  difference, with Payet sealing a £25m transfer to the south of France at the
  end of the month. Cristiano Ronaldo They say you should never go back, and
  that proved to be the case following Ronaldo’s surprise return to Old Trafford
  in 2021. Quite simply, the move was a disaster, with the Portuguese superstar
  simply not the player he once was. Going on to suffer an almighty fallout with
  Erik ten Hag was another problem. He left the stadium after being substituted
  in a pre-season friendly against Rayo Vallecano, twice refused to go on before
  walking down the tunnel in a match against Tottenham and then sat down to do
  that interview with Piers Morgan, in which he claimed to have been “betrayed”
  by the club. There was no way back after that and Ronaldo soon joined the
  Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, where he remains to this day, happier and much,
  much richer.
