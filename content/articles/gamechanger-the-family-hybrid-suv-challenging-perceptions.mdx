  Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids are charging ahead in Australia, with new
  models arriving faster than most of us can keep up. But the Leapmotor C10 REEV
  Ultra Hybrid isn’t just another compact SUV. With a driving range that can
  take you from Melbourne to Canberra on a single charge and tank, it’s a hybrid
  built for the chaos of family life. Three car seats across the backseat? Done.
  Add a pram, a scooter and a football kit, and there will still be room for the
  dog. Leapmotor is fairly new to Australians – the brand only launched down
  under in 2024 – but it has been manufacturing and selling EV and hybrid
  vehicles in China since 2015. The C10 REEV Ultra Hybrid is one of its first
  models to be offered to the Australian market, and is designed to shift
  perceptions of what affordable electric driving can look like for families.
  That’s a big ambition in a fast-growing category, so we put the flagship
  hybrid to the test. Going the distance OK, first of all: 1,150km with no
  stops? (For the uninitiated, that range is per the NEDC – the New European
  Driving Cycle – a standardised test used to assess fuel economy and
  emissions.) The C10 REEV has two power sources: a 28.4kWh battery and a
  1.5-litre petrol engine. Unlike other hybrid setups, you don’t select between
  electric or fuel power. Instead, the combustion engine kicks in when the
  electric battery is running low, and charges it as you drive. This means the
  C10 REEV always drives like an EV (quietly and smoothly) but has a much bigger
  range than you’d expect. Designed for the long haul If you’re driving a long
  way without stopping, you’re going to need space to stretch out. And the C10
  REEV delivers. Keyless entry triggers a quiet welcome, and the front seats
  automatically glide back for easy entry, providing more space to step into.
  When the doors close, they slide forward again, leaving more than enough room
  in the back for the family, pets, luggage and anything else coming along for
  the journey. The second thing you’ll notice is the silence. From the moment
  the keycard swipes the driver’s side mirror to unlock the car, the C10 REEV is
  on and ready to roll; you just wouldn’t know it from listening. That doesn’t
  change when you’re driving, either. Rarely misses a beat For day-to-day
  driving, tech integrations make the C10 REEV feel ahead of the curve for its
  category. The 14.6-inch touchscreen anchors the dash, with maps, music,
  messages and climate control all customisable via voice control. Creature
  comforts are well covered in the form of heated seats, a 12-speaker audio
  system, and an ambient lighting system, and the vehicle boasts smart safety
  features, such as lane keep assist and blind spot detection. Driving the C10
  REEV on city streets, freeways and suburban roads, it’s clear it nails the
  basics. It’s rare to find a hybrid SUV that nails practicality and polish,
  space and smarts. But in a fast-moving category, the C10 REEV Ultra Hybrid
  earns its place – and maybe a spot in the driveway too. Discover more about
  the C10 REEV Ultra Hybrid.
