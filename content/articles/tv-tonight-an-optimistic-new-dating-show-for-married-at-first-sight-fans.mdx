  Stranded on Honeymoon Island 9pm, BBC One Davina McCall plays matchmaker in a
  dating series that isn’t a million miles away from Married at First Sight,
  except the pairs hook up at a speed-dating event and are sent to a tropical
  island with basic supplies and a composting loo (“I’ve never had ‘the poo
  chat’ with a man!” squirms one bride). We meet the first three couples – a
  refreshingly diverse mix of people with “sheer blind optimism” – and it all
  goes well until a bombshell drops. Hollie Richardson The Lost Neanderthals
  8pm, BBC Four It is amazing what a tooth can tell you. That is one of the main
  takeaways from this absorbing film about the Mandrin Cave in southern France,
  a natural shelter for humans since prehistoric times. The archaeological
  treasure trove is where the remains of a Neanderthal nicknamed Thorin were
  uncovered, revealing details about what life was like 50,000 years ago. Graeme
  Virtue Nazis, U-boats and the Battle for the Atlantic 9pm, BBC Two The first
  in a two-part documentary about one of the second world war’s most crucial
  campaigns features vivid footage of deep-sea wrecks off the coast of Ireland.
  We also hear from David Brew – he sadly grew up knowing little about his
  father, whose Royal Navy ship was torpedoed by a Nazi sub. Hannah J Davies
  Long Lost Family: The Mother and Baby Home Scandal 9pm, ITV1 Jean was sent to
  the Home of the Good Shepherd in Surrey when she was 16 – just one of the
  unmarried mothers caught in the scandal of mother and baby homes. Now she is
  looking for her long-lost daughter in a two-parter that will unlock the
  deepest emotions. HR Mudtown 9pm, U&amp;Alibi The intensity ramps up in this
  drama about a magistrate, Claire (Erin Richards), who deals with a case too
  close to home. When her friend Beca (Lauren Morais) brings her son, Sonny
  (Lloyd Meredith), over for dinner, Claire reconsiders his involvement in the
  recent shooting. HR Limbs in the Loch: Catching a Killer 10pm, BBC Two William
  Beggs was a “very normal, very engaging, very charming” member of the Young
  Conservatives. He also harboured dark thoughts and fantasies – and had a
  shadowy, horrific past. When teenager Barry Wallace was found dismembered and
  dumped in Loch Lomond in 1999, Beggs was the prime suspect but he had
  vanished. This deeply disturbing true-crime account continues. Ali Catterall
