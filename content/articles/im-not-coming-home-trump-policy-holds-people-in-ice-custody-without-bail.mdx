  Liset Fernandez spent most of the summer worried about her dad, Luis, but a
  few weeks ago she got some good news. After being held in Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody for weeks, an immigration judge in Texas
  granted him release on a $5,000 bond. Luis, came to the US from Ecuador in
  1994, had been held in detention at a facility in Livingston, Texas, thousands
  of miles away from his home in Queens. Liset, 17, had taken on extra shifts
  working a retail job to support her mom and nine-year-old brother. Luis’s
  co-workers at the Square diner, a railcar-style greasy spoon in Manhattan’s
  Tribeca neighborhood for over 100 years, had raised more than $20,000 to
  support him and his family. But when Liset logged on to a Department of
  Homeland Security (DHS) website to pay the bond, she got a message telling her
  that her dad was ineligible for release. It fell to her to tell her dad that
  instead of coming home that day, he would remain detained. “It was upsetting
  for everyone,” Liset said. “His voice sounded completely disappointed.” Luis
  was being detained because of a new DHS policy arguing that all people who
  enter the US illegally are ineligible for bond, regardless of how long they
  have been here and whether or not they pose a flight risk. In Fernandez’s
  case, DHS went even further, deploying a rarely used maneuver to pause the
  immigration judge’s bond ruling while it appealed his ruling. Federal
  regulations allow the agency to automatically stay an immigration judge’s bond
  decision while they appeal the case to the board of immigration appeals. The
  maneuver means Fernandez will remain detained while his case is pending before
  the board of immigration appeals. Since the board is being bogged down with
  appeals, it’s unclear how long it could take to resolve the case, said Craig
  Relles, an immigration attorney representing Fernandez. Fernandez’s case shows
  how the Trump administration is “ratcheting up every aspect of the immigration
  system” for people who have been in the US no matter how long they’ve been in
  the US, said Suchita Mathur, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council. “At
  every step of the way, they’re inflicting the maximum punishment on people,”
  she said. “It’s all part and parcel of the administration’s effort to make
  this process so punitive and unbearable that people give up.” The justice
  department, which oversees immigration courts, adopted the procedure for
  automatically pausing an immigration judge’s bond ruling in the aftermath of
  the September 11 attacks amid concerns about national security. At the time,
  there were concerns about how it could be used to unjustly detain people. Both
  Mathur and Relles said they had rarely seen the appeal and stay practice used
  until this summer. Now, they said the practice is widespread. Lawyers
  representing the Department of Homeland Security have been instructed to
  appeal every decision in which someone is granted bond and immediately pause
  the judge’s ruling while the appeal is pending, according to an agency
  official familiar with the matter. They have also been told they will be fired
  if they do not take such action, the person said. Asked whether lawyers were
  being told to automatically appeal in all cases where bond was granted, the
  Department of Homeland Security said: “Every decision to appeal is based on
  the facts of the case. No one has been fired for not appealing a case.” In
  recent months, federal judges across the country, including in Minnesota,
  Nebraska and Maryland, have ruled in favor of detained migrants who have
  challenged the practice. Appealing the bond ruling and automatically staying
  an immigration judge’s decision to grant bond, the judges have said, puts the
  due process rights of detainees at risk. “The government’s discretion in
  matters of immigration is deep and wide, but surely its chop does not overcome
  the banks of due process enshrined in the constitution,” Julie Rubin, a US
  district judge in Maryland, wrote this month in a ruling granting release of a
  migrant who was detained even though an immigration judge had ordered bond.
  “Invocation of the automatic stay renders the [immigration judge’s] custody
  redetermination order an ‘empty gesture’ absent demonstration of a compelling
  interest or special circumstance left unanswered by [the immigration judge].”
  “It seems like there’s a nationwide policy from headquarters instructing them
  to file these automatic stays,” Mathur said. Such a policy “would raise even
  more questions about due process. Because if they’re not even conducting
  individualized analyses before filing these, that’s even more shocking.” The
  Department of Homeland Security said Fernandez had entered the country
  illegally and had two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated. The
  agency did not provide more information on the cases, but told Tribeca
  Citizen, a local news site, the charges were from 2003 and 2014. “Under
  President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the
  consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US,” the
  Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. But that is not what
  Fernandez’s co-workers knew. At the Square Diner, he was known as a hard
  worker, who would work overtime to support his Liset and his nine-year-old
  son. He was the person who would welcome new employees into the fold, always
  be quick with a joke, and cover for someone who needed to step out for an
  emergency and then give them the earnings they missed. He would FaceTime his
  kids during long shifts and never say a bad word about customers who were
  stingy with tips. The only thing he would ever eat at work – sometimes with
  some teasing – were big salad bowls filled with soup. Usually chicken, but
  occasionally different types mixed together. The fact that Luis had been in
  the United States for so long, was working and paying taxes, and had two
  children who are US citizens made him someone who was clearly eligible for
  bond, Relles said. “The Department of Homeland Security had the opportunity to
  present any and all evidence indicating that he was a danger, that there were
  serious infractions in the past. And he was able to meet his burden,
  establishing that he was not a danger and is not a flight risk,” Relles said.
  “He’s human. He has heart,” said one co-worker who asked to remain anonymous
  because they feared for their safety. “He’s [an] extremely honest person. With
  money, with food, with anything, you just name it. And the most important
  thing is the best father.” The co-worker said they had spoken to Luis recently
  and he was working in the kitchen of the detention center where he is being
  held. Recently he volunteered to give the other detainees haircuts. The last
  time Liset saw her dad in person was early in the morning on 24 June when he
  came to her bedroom to say goodbye. He had been summoned to appear that
  morning for a check-in on his asylum application in Long Island. The day
  before he was set to leave, Luis became suspicious that something might happen
  to him. He shared the location on his phone with Liset. Still, Liset didn’t
  think there was much to worry about and said goodbye. It was a scorching hot
  day in New York and Liset went to the beach with her cousin to celebrate the
  end of the school year and the start of summer vacation. While she was there,
  Luis called her. She could tell from the tone of his voice that something was
  wrong. He told her not to worry, but that he was going to be arrested.
  “They’re going to take me, Ice is here, and I’m not coming home anytime soon,”
  he told her. “If anything happens, make sure you take care of yourself.”
  Fernandezwas one of thousands of immigrants arrested by the Trump
  administration as part of its effort to ramp up deportations. Half of the
  migrants arrested in the New York City area this year have been arrested, like
  Fernandez was, at routine check-ins at immigration offices, according to
  federal data analyzed by the New York Times. Liset didn’t hear from her dad
  for a few days. But when she eventually got ahold of him he had been
  transferred to a facility in Texas. Since he’s been detained, Liset has talked
  to her dad almost every day, usually for just a few minutes. He’s told her
  that there are about 20 people in his room and that it’s extremely cold
  because air conditioners are running 24/7. The first few weeks in detention,
  Liset said, Luis would share a cup of ramen noodles with two other men for
  meals. Liset described her dad as a hard worker who wanted to make sure his
  family was taken care of financially while also making sure he could spend
  time with them. Since her mom only speaks limited English, it’s fallen on
  Liset to take the lead on her dad’s legal case while also taking on more
  shifts at work. “This is incredibly draining,” she said. José Olivares
