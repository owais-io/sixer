  Texas cannot require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every
  classroom, a judge said on Wednesday in a temporary ruling against the state’s
  new requirement, making it the third such state law to be blocked by a court.
  A group of Dallas-area families and faith leaders sought a preliminary
  injunction against the law, which goes into effect on 1 September. They say
  the requirement violates the first amendment’s protections for the separation
  of church and state and the right to free religious exercise. Texas is the
  largest state to attempt such a requirement, and US district judge Fred
  Biery’s ruling from San Antonio is the latest in a widening legal fight that’s
  expected to eventually go before the US supreme court. “Even though the Ten
  Commandments would not be affirmatively taught, the captive audience of
  students likely would have questions, which teachers would feel compelled to
  answer. That is what they do,” Biery wrote in the 55-page ruling that began
  with quoting the first amendment and ended with “Amen”. “[T]he displays are
  likely to pressure the child-Plaintiffs into religious observance, meditation
  on, veneration, and adoption of the State’s favored religious scripture, and
  into suppressing expression of their own religious or nonreligious background
  and beliefs while at school.” Biery continued: “There is also insufficient
  evidence of a broader tradition of using the Ten Commandments in public
  education, and there is no tradition of permanently displaying the Ten
  Commandments in public-school classrooms. There are ways in which students
  could be taught any relevant history of the Ten Commandments without the state
  selecting an official version of scripture, approving it in state law, and
  then displaying it in every classroom on a permanent basis.” The lawsuit names
  the Texas education agency, state education commissioner Mike Morath and three
  Dallas-area school districts as defendants. Hailing the preliminary
  injunction, plaintiff Rabbi Mara Nathan said: “As a rabbi and public school
  parent, I welcome this ruling. Children’s religious beliefs should be
  instilled by parents and faith communities, not politicians and public
  schools.” Heather Weaver, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties
  Union’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, echoed similar sentiments.
  “Public schools are not Sunday schools. Today’s decision ensures that our
  clients’ schools will remain spaces where all students, regardless of their
  faith, feel welcomed and can learn without worrying that they do not live up
  to the state’s preferred religious beliefs,” Weaver said. Meanwhile, Freedom
  From Religion Foundation co-president Annie Laurie Gaylor said: “Religious
  instruction must be left to parents, not the state, which has no business
  telling anyone how many gods to have, which gods to have or whether to have
  any gods at all.” A federal appeals court has blocked a similar law in
  Louisiana, and a judge in Arkansas told four districts they cannot put up the
  posters, although other districts in the state said they’re not putting them
  up either. Although Friday’s ruling marked a major win for civil liberties
  groups who say the law violates the separation of church and state, the legal
  battle is likely far from over. Religious groups and conservatives say the Ten
  Commandments are part of the foundation of the United States’s judicial and
  educational systems and should be displayed. Texas has a Ten Commandments
  monument on the Capitol grounds and won a 2005 supreme court case that upheld
  the monument. In Louisiana – the first state that mandated the Ten
  Commandments be displayed in classrooms – a panel of three appellate judges in
  June ruled that the law was unconstitutional.
