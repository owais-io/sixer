  ‘Our financial literacy is so fucked,” says Celine Song. We’re having
  breakfast in Manhattan on a sunny Saturday in early July, a few weeks after
  her new film, Materialists, has opened in New York City. She’s wearing a
  charmingly ironic outfit: a T-shirt that says “HOWDY” and a baseball cap that
  says “Big” (she’s petite, 5ft 4in, for the record) – but she speaks with
  almost disarming earnestness. She’s frustrated, she tells me, that people have
  described one of the characters in her film, a private equity manager with a
  $12m apartment, as a “billionaire”. “If you’re a billionaire, your big
  apartment is not $12m!” she exclaims. “A billion dollars is not a hundred of
  $1m,” she adds. “No, it’s a thousand of that.” She’s offended because a
  billionaire would never be a likable character in her movie. “I think because
  of how visible billionaires are, we think that’s what wealth is. And I’m like:
  no, that’s just crime.” It’s a bit unusual to be talking about financial
  literacy in the context of a romcom, the genre that Materialists defiantly
  embraces with its story of a high-end matchmaker (Dakota Johnson) torn between
  an old flame with no money (Chris Evans) and a suave, moneyed suitor, the
  “not-billionaire” in question (Pedro Pascal). Romantic comedies, particularly
  those set in New York City, tend to be escapist fantasies: you’re not supposed
  to wonder how the heroine can afford to live in a swanky one-bedroom in
  Manhattan or wear Louboutins; you’re certainly not supposed to ponder the
  moral implications of the hero’s wealth. But in Materialists, every detail is
  spelled out. Early in the film, Lucy (Johnson) announces to Harry (Pascal)
  that she makes “$80,000 a year before taxes” – something the private equity
  partner should keep in mind before pursuing her. The characters’ apartments,
  Song says, were carefully researched and designed based on their economic
  situations. There’s Harry’s $12m penthouse in the expensive Manhattan
  neighbourhood Tribeca. Lucy lives in an aspirational studio in the posh
  neighbourhood of Brooklyn Heights that she rented right before the Covid-19
  pandemic (Song looked on US real estate website Zillow to estimate the rent);
  Evans’s character John lives with three roommates in south-west Brooklyn’s
  Sunset Park. (It was supposed to be in Williamsburg, before the film’s
  construction crew said that he’d never be able to afford that.) It’s not that
  Song is a mercenary realist. The only subject that makes her eyes light up as
  much as money is love, which she describes as “being hit by lightning”. Song’s
  first feature film, Past Lives, which nabbed two Oscar nominations in 2024,
  spins a beautiful time-crossing and bicultural saga around a happily married
  Korean immigrant in the US – a stand-in for Song – who re-encounters a
  childhood sweetheart and confronts the life that could have been. The
  characters talk about inyeon, a Buddhist belief in relationships as something
  fated and cosmic, cutting across life cycles. There’s no such wistful dreaming
  in Materialists. Harry’s romantic overture to Lucy is to tell her that he’s
  interested in her “intangible assets”; he wants to date the broker, the person
  who decides who is and isn’t valuable. “I feel like as we grow into this
  efficiency-focused, productivity-focused way of thinking about the world,
  everything we do is so that we can be better, faster, stronger,” Song says of
  our culture of relentless optimisation. “Where is the place where you’re just
  like an animal who’s trying to live?” Song, 36, was born in Seoul to artist
  parents. She says her father, a film-maker, named her after the impish stage
  magician played by Juliet Berto in Jacques Rivette’s French new wave classic
  Céline and Julie Go Boating. When Song was 12, the family emigrated to
  Ontario, Canada, where she lived throughout her college years, before moving
  to New York to pursue a master of fine arts degree in playwriting at Columbia
  University. By the time she started making movies, she had achieved
  considerable success in theatre for deeply personal, yet daringly experimental
  plays, including 2019’s Endlings, which weaves together the stories of three
  female Korean divers and a Korean-Canadian writer in New York, and a live
  production of The Seagull on the Sims 4, staged during lockdown in 2020. Song
  never really suffered the indignities of modern dating. As portrayed in Past
  Lives, she met her husband, the screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes – who recently
  wrote Luca Guadagnino’s tennis film Challengers – at a writing residency in
  Montauk in Long Island when she was 24. But in her early years in New York,
  she got a pretty acrid taste of dating culture when she worked as a matchmaker
  for six months, after hearing about the gig from a friend in the industry. It
  seemed like an “HR job” with a more “involved client-facing element” – and
  Song had studied psychology in her undergraduate years. But she knew she
  couldn’t make lightning strike for her clients, and they knew it, too. “I was
  basically given instructions on who to say no to,” she says of the job. “They
  were saying: ‘I’m not even available to get hit by lightning by certain people
  who don’t meet my criteria.’” The worst of them, sampled in the film, were
  brazen with their bigotry. “People would rank what races they wanted. They
  would literally say: ‘No Asians’. They wouldn’t admit that even to their
  therapist.” She had wanted to make a film about the experience for years, but
  the script had never quite worked. Then she realised why. “I thought the focus
  was on the clients. But the problem is that the clients are not that
  interesting, because they all want the same thing. If I asked 10 clients what
  kind of guy they wanted, they would all say: over 6ft tall, makes more money
  than me, great body, strong hairline.” Things clicked when one day, years ago,
  she ran into an old friend from graduate school at a fancy gala dinner for
  theatre donors. She was there as one of the rising playwrights that wealthy
  patrons could rub shoulders with; he, once a very promising acting student,
  was there as a server. When she went over to greet and hug her friend, she
  sensed that they were both embarrassed. It was as if they were breaking an
  invisible barrier – like Rose going below deck to fraternise with Jack in
  Titanic. “How Victorian is that?” she says. “But it’s 2017!” She realised that
  the movie she was trying to make was about class, which is what all the great
  romances are really about, anyway. Early in Materialists, when Lucy meets
  Harry at a fancy wedding she’s helped facilitate, John interrupts them – he’s
  there as a waiter. It’s our first indication that Lucy is an impostor in the
  world of wealth that she’s insinuated herself into so elegantly and
  seamlessly. The cold calculus with which she surveys people as dating
  prospects hits something of an iceberg whenever she’s with John: love, as
  always, gets in the way of logic. Lucy eventually undergoes a reckoning in
  Materialists, but Song doesn’t judge her protagonist too harshly. She has deep
  empathy for women like her, who trust in logic to rescue them. She brings up
  the “tradwife” trend taking over social media, where women embrace traditional
  gender roles and domesticity, as a symptom of a crisis beneath the surface. “I
  think it has so much to do with how deeply broken our economic systems are,
  especially in the US. As we have learned, the American dream is not
  achievable. You cannot jump your class. But what’s one of the few ways that
  you can still jump your class? Well, marriage.” If there is an element of
  escapist fantasy to the film, it’s that the protagonists, all deeply insecure
  in their own ways about their desirability, are played by three of the most
  beautiful people in the world. To have Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vying for
  your hand is an embarrassment of riches, and Song admits that even casting
  Dakota Johnson as Lucy – a woman who believes there’s nothing special about
  her – was a bit of a “fantasy trick”. “But the thing is, it wasn’t a stretch
  for my actors to play these roles; they got it better than me. Who feels more
  like merchandise than the guy who plays the Mandalorian or Captain America?”
  For all its hard-nosed cynicism, Materialists is even more sentimental of a
  romance than Past Lives; its declarations about romance are all the sweeter
  for the superficial, number-crunching conventions they resist. Even so, making
  a star-studded romantic comedy after the critical success of Past Lives is a
  bold move. The genre is more or less dead today, or relegated to Christmas
  specials on streaming services. Even A24, which distributed the movie in the
  US, seemed to be self-conscious about releasing a romcom: the company
  published a “syllabus” for Materialists, a list of Song’s reference films,
  replete with highbrow names such as Thomas Vinterberg and Mike Leigh, as well
  as Merchant Ivory productions and Martin Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence. But
  Song herself is unselfconscious about her love for romances. “I still remember
  showing Past Lives at this festival in Ireland,” she says. “This one really
  burly Irish guy was asking me a question during the Q&amp;A. And he started
  crying, telling me the story of his own childhood sweetheart. And I remember
  thinking: it’s funny that when it comes to the matters of love, we relegate it
  to the girlies. But the truth is that everybody’s just actually starved of
  love and affection. I knew, when I was making Materialists, that there is a
  very real market for it.” She embraces the idea that Materialists might spark
  more conversations about love and romance. “It is so romantic that I get to
  invite the audience to the movie theatre for two hours to do nothing but talk
  about love and dating and relationships and marriage.” But then again, there’s
  always the matter of money. “We get to be so real! I get to say things like
  $12m [apartment]! You know, the most reliable, audible response in every
  screening I’ve been in is the moment when Harry says ‘$12m’.” Materialists is
  in UK cinemas from 13 August. • This article was amended on 6 August 2025 to
