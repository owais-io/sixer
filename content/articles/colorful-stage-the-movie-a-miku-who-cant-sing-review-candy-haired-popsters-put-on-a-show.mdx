  Colorful Stage! The Movie: A Miku Who Can’t Sing review – candy-haired
  popsters put on a show
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-25T06:00:51Z'
bodyText: >-
  Even by the standards of franchise anime that caters to the faithful and drops
  newcomers in blind, this is particularly incomprehensible. Based on the mobile
  game Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, it features a barely characterised blur of
  wannabe musicians and actors who ascribe Manhattan Project importance to
  writing syrupy J-pop. As they interact with virtual counterparts in metaverses
  called “Sekai” created from users’ emotions, the film is like The Matrix if
  Neo had huffed a nitrous oxide canister before having every edition of Pop
  Idol downloaded into his cranium. One of the virtual pop stars, a rogue
  version of Hatsune Miku (voiced by Saki Fuijta), keeps invading high-school
  kids’ mobile phones and flatscreens, begging for help. Apparently issuing from
  a Sekai created by the emo angst of everyone about to give up on their
  creative ambitions, she is hoping to connect with these lost souls. So Miku
  taps this creative hive mind about how better to refine the ditty she believes
  can unite the world – while the seething mass of negativity in her home
  dimension swells to apocalyptic proportions. Amid interchangeably candy-haired
  popsters screaming hysterically, the opening to Colorful Stage! has precious
  little to grasp hold of. None of the characters are given any weight, other
  than the introspective Ichika (Ruriko Noguchi), whose vaguely implied past
  disappointments mean Miku is drawn to her. With the franchise’s five pop
  groups not even named as they decide to put on a show, the film just leaves a
  blanket impression of ultra-pious self-empowerment and aspiration. Characters
  make such heroic exhortations as: “We should probably put more work into our
  socials than we usually do.” More’s the pity, as the animation is absolutely
  top-drawer. The lollipop-headed, tendril-headed popsters are lushly drawn, and
  director Hiroyuki Hata is particularly gifted at using light to lift scenes
  with an Elysian glow. The climactic gig, is as dynamic and even more
  psychedelic than professional concert films. But this garbled, chronically
  online film is clearly targeted at the TikTok generation, and might just be
  the future of film-making after all. • Colorful Stage! The Movie: A Miku Who
  Can’t Sing is in UK and Irish cinemas from 31 August
