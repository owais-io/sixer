  I’ve been telling Mabel she’ll be four soon for about a month. I bought her
  present similarly early, though I am unsure whether to wrap it. When the
  Amazon guy delivers a gift from my sister on the day, he wishes Mabel “happy
  birthday” through the gate. As I sing the opening bars, the build-up has
  clearly worked: she jumps up with excitement and licks my knees. I should
  clarify at this point that Mabel is not my child – she’s a cocker spaniel. If
  this sounds unhinged, I’d like to stress it’s statistically very normal,
  actually. “Pet birthdays” are a booming market, with the UK industry alone now
  worth an estimated £1.7bn. A recent survey by Moonpig found 64% of pet owners
  in the UK celebrate their pets’ birthdays, with as many as 83% of gen Z
  embracing gourmet treats or even themed parties. Karl Marx might have called
  pet birthdays the last stage of capitalism, where corporations convince people
  to spend their squeezed wages on cards for species who can’t read. The growth
  of social media has undoubtedly encouraged the trend. If a cat has a birthday
  and no one’s around to see the TikTok, does it make a meowing sound? As I ate
  a celebratory slice of chocolate torte that was poisonous to dogs, I wondered
  whether Mabel’s special day had somehow become not about Mabel at all. Perhaps
  it is pointless to mark the birthday of a pet who doesn’t know what a birthday
  is. But then, parents spend hundreds on gifts for one-year-old children who
  only want to play with the boxes. Pets are a part of our families, too, so
  shouldn’t that include celebrating their milestones? Next year, I’ll
  compromise: spend less on the dog’s present, but let her eat the paper.
