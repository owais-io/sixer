  Patty Murray, the Washington senator, has called for the Trump administration
  to provide “immediate answers” about reports that two firefighters were
  detained by border agents as they were responding to a wildfire in the state.
  Federal immigration authorities on Wednesday staged an operation on the scene
  of the Bear Gulch fire, a nearly 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) blaze in the
  Olympic national forest, where they arrested two people who were part of a
  contract firefighting crew, the Seattle Times first reported. The fire is the
  largest currently burning in the state. Authorities made the firefighters line
  up to show ID, the Seattle Times reported. One firefighter told the newspaper
  that they were not permitted to say goodbye to their detained colleagues. “I
  asked them if his [co-workers] can say goodbye to him because they’re family,
  and they’re just ripping them away,” the firefighter said to the Seattle
  Times, adding that the federal agent swore and told the firefighter to leave.
  The operation sparked widespread condemnation in the state. Murray in her
  statement released on Thursday morning demanded information about the
  whereabouts of the firefighters and the administration’s policy around
  immigration enforcement during wildfires. The Trump administration’s
  immigration policy was “fundamentally sick”, Murray said. She continued:
  “Trump has wrongfully detained everyone from lawful green-card holders to
  American citizens – no one should assume this was necessary or appropriate.”
  The US border patrol later on Thursday released some information on the
  operation, saying that it had assisted the Bureau of Land Management after
  that agency requested help after terminating contracts with two companies
  following a criminal investigation. While verifying the identities of contract
  personnel, federal agents identified two people “present in the United States
  illegally”, the border patrol said in a statement, including one person who
  had a previous order of removal. The agency did not provide more details about
  the nature of the criminal investigation and the identities of the
  firefighters have not been made public. Authorities arrested the men on
  charges of illegal entry, and escorted 42 others off federal lands, according
  to the border patrol statement. The US Forest Service said in a statement that
  it was aware of the border patrol operation and that the activities did not
  interfere with firefighting efforts. Murray in her statement said the
  president had been undercutting firefighting abilities in other ways,
  including by “decimating” the US Forest Service. The administration
  significantly cut budgets and staffing at the agencies that manage much of the
  country’s federal lands, leaving the US unprepared for this year’s fire
  season, the Guardian previously reported. “Here in the Pacific north-west,
  wildfires can [burn] and have burned entire towns to the ground. We count on
  our brave firefighters, who put their lives on the line, to keep our
  communities safe – this new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the
  job is as immoral as it is dangerous,” said Murray, who has represented
  Washington in the US Senate since 1993. “What’s next? Will Trump start
  detaining immigrant service members? Or will he just maintain his current
  policy of deporting Purple Heart veterans?” Nearly 430 personnel are
  responding to the Bear Gulch fire on the state’s Olympic peninsula.
  Firefighters told the Seattle Times that two contract crews had been sent to
  cut wood and were waiting for a supervisor when federal law enforcement
  arrived in the area.
