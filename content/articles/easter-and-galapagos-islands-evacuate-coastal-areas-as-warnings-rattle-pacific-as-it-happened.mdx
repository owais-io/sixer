  Tsunami alerts remain in effect in coastal parts of Chile, Ecuador, Peru and
  Colombia, and for Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, following the
  massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia’s far eastern coast – one of the
  strongest ever recorded – on Wednesday. Most earlier warnings were lifted or
  downgraded in most other parts of the world as the day went on, including for
  Japan, the US, Russia, the Philippines, and others, after the impact of the
  water surges was less than initially feared. Authorities ordered evacuations
  from vulnerable coastal areas to safe zones on Ecuador and Chile’s Pacific
  islands on Wednesday, after the massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered
  tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Waves recently begun to hit
  Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands with heights of about 1 meter and 0.4 meters were
  reportedly recorded in the islands of Baltra and Santacruz. Residents and
  tourists on Chile’s Easter Island evacuated to a church on higher ground,
  while evacuations began along the mainland’s Pacific coast. Chile also
  evacuated five prisons due to their location at low elevations. Meanwhile in
  French Polynesia, local authorities lifted the tsunami alert in the remote
  Marquesas Islands. They said people could return to their homes, but should
  remain cautious. Tsunami waves had begun hitting early in the day, but were
  smaller than initially feared, authorities said. In the US, major flooding had
  been avoided in the northern California community of Crescent City that
  experienced the highest tsunami waves on the west coast (around 8 feet tall),
  the city manager, Eric Wier, said. “It was a long night for all of us,” he
  said. “We were fortunate this time.” You can read our latest news story here:
  Chile is evacuating five prisons as the country remains on high alert for
  possible tsunamis. Senapred, Chile’s national disaster response agency, said
  in a statement on their website that all five are being evacuated due to their
  location at low elevations. The inmates will be transferred to other prisons
  as part of Chile’s natural emergency protocol, interior minister Álvaro
  Elizalde told CNN Chile. Waves have started to hit Ecuador’s Galapagos
  Islands, according to data from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC)
  reported by CNN. Wave heights of about 1 meter and 0.4 meters were reportedly
  recorded in the islands of Baltra and Santacruz. Tsunami advisories have been
  cancelled for coastal areas of California – from Ragged Point to Humboldt/Del
  Norte – Oregon and Washington. Local authorities lifted the tsunami alert in
  the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia on Wednesday, Reuters repors, and
  said people could return to their homes, but said residents should remain
  cautious. Tsunami waves had begun hitting early on Wednesday, but were smaller
  than initially feared, authorities said. The High Commission of the Republic
  in French Polynesia said wave heights had reached 1.50 metres, down from a
  previous forecast of up to 4 metres. Additional smaller waves were expected in
  the coming hours, officials said. Elsewhere in French Polynesia, wave heights
  were expected to remain below 30cm. However, residents are urged to stay away
  from shorelines and river mouths. The Marquesas Islands, among the most remote
  in the world, have a population of approximately 9,500, according to a 2022
  census. French Polynesia’s five archipelagos comprise 118 islands but have a
  total land area of only about 4,200 sq km. There have been around 125
  aftershocks of 4.4-magnitude or greater near Russia since the 8.8-magnitude
  earthquake struck off the country’s coast, data from the US Geological Survey
  shows. Strong aftershocks continue to rock the region, with a 6.4-magnitude
  one striking some 200 miles south-west of the epicenter of yesterday’s quake
  at about 11am ET on Wednesday. Aftershocks are usually strongest shortly after
  the main earthquake and lessen as time goes on. Authorities ordered
  evacuations on Ecuador and Chile’s Pacific islands on Wednesday, after the
  massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific
  Ocean. Residents and tourists on Chile’s Easter Island, located some 3,700 km
  (2,300 miles) off South America’s western coast, evacuated to a church on
  higher ground, while evacuations began along the mainland’s Pacific coast. In
  Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, some 970 km (600 miles) west of the mainland, the
  government ordered that people living in vulnerable coastal areas make their
  way to safe zones established by the country’s emergency management agency.
  Tsunami warnings are still in effect for: Chile: upgraded its tsunami warning
  for most of its Pacific coast to the highest level Easter Island: residents
  told to evacuate to safe zones Colombia: issued a red alert in its
  northeastern Chocó and Nariño regions. Officials have called for evacuation of
  beaches and low-tide areas Peru: issued a tsunami alert for its Pacific
  coastline Tsunami alerts also remain in effect for: French Polynesia: issued a
  tsunami alert for the Marquesas Islands archipelago Galápagos Islands: visitor
  sites temporarily closed amid tsunami alert, and precautionary evacuation of
  vulnerable coastal areas such as beaches, docks, and other low-lying areas
  ordered Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu Tsunami advisories are
  in effect for: Mexico: authorities issued a tsunami advisory for its Pacific
  coast as a preventative measure Japan: lifted all tsunami warnings, however a
  tsunami advisory remains in effect for Pacific coast regions from Hokkaido to
  Kyushu US: tsunami warnings have been downgraded but advisories remain in
  effect in parts of California, Hawaii, Alaska and Oregon Tsunami warnings and
  advisories lifted in: Japan: Japan has lifted all tsunami warnings, according
  to the country’s meteorological agency Philippines: canceled a tsunami
  advisory that was issued for several coastal communities across the country
  Russia: authorities in the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula said a tsunami
  warning had been lifted, more than 11 hours after the 8.8 magnitude earthquake
  prompted evacuations Canada: tsunami advisory canceled for British Columbia
  coast Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands Locations across Micronesia,
  Australia and New Zealand are also in the clear In the US, the northern
  California beach community that experienced the highest tsunami waves on the
  west coast has not seen damage so far, according to city officials. “It was a
  long night for all of us,” said Eric Wier, the city manager of Crescent City.
  “We were fortunate this time. There was significant tsunami surges. We’re
  still dealing with those now, but it did stay within the banks of Elk Creek.”
  The area saw peak waves of around 8 feet, in line with their highest tides of
  the year, but not enough to cause flooding inside the central area of the
  city, Wier said. “The city downtown is at a high enough elevation that it is
  open,” said Wier. Peruvians received beeping alerts and text messages on their
  mobile phones from the National Civil Defence Institute warning them to stay
  away from the beach and telling authorities to close coastal access points
  along the country’s 1,864-mile (3,000 km) long Pacific-facing coastline.
  Shortly before, Peru’s Emergency Operations Centre issued a tsunami warning
  closing 65 ports along the country’s coast, evacuating port workers and
  restricting fishing and sailing activities from early on Wednesday morning,
  following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake on the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka.
  The Peruvian Navy’s Hydrography and Navigation Directorate said waves of
  between 1 and 2.3 metres will reach the Peruvian coast starting at 10.07am
  local time, from the north and continue to the south until around 12.30pm. In
  the capital Lima, the coastal road known as the costanera was closed, though
  La Punta, a low-lying peninsula in the nearby port district Callao, was not
  evacuated. Rear Admiral Jorge Vizcarra, spokesperson for the Peruvian Navy,
  said: “The train of waves will be noticeable, but it will not be high enough
  to have a significant impact on the population.” Here is a clip of rocks
  falling down Kamchatka cliffs after the earthquake hit Russia’s far east. In
  Hawaii, tsunami warning sirens blared twice on Tuesday afternoon on multiple
  islands, including Oahu, where the capital, Honolulu, is located, and Kauai.
  Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of
  emergency management warned: “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves
  expected.” As residents raced to get out, traffic backed up in some Honolulu
  neighbourhoods. Even though it is summer break for pupils, some schools issued
  alerts cancelling sports and other activities. On Kauai, shortly after the
  tsunami warning was issued, staff at the National Tropical Botanical Garden
  suspended tours on its south shore and moved all visitors and employees out of
  the inundation zone to higher ground. Still, blue skies and breezy conditions
  prevailed as many in Hawaii left work early heading for home or designated
  safe areas away from the islands’ heavily populated coastline. Residents have
  become particularly sensitive to phone warnings and civil defence sirens after
  Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency issued a false alert warning of an
  inbound “ballistic missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic. All
  islands activated emergency operating centres, shelters began opening, and
  people in coastal areas were advised to head to higher ground immediately.
  Kauai police asked the public to stay off the road unless absolutely
  necessary. After the waves arrived, they were not as destructive as feared,
  and Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency said evacuation orders had been
  lifted and there were no reports of major damage. Bryan Manabat in Saipan In
  nearby Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands,
  similar warnings were issued. Government offices were closed and businesses in
  low-lying areas shut their doors. Petrol stations had long lines of vehicles
  wanting to fill up. Some residents living near the shoreline in Saipan, an
  island of about 43,000 people, fled to higher ground as they waited for the
  all clear from authorities. Tsunami drills by emergency authorities have been
  held regularly in on the island. In the Pacific territory of Guam, shortly
  before lunchtime on Tuesday, Sam Mabini’s phone began to ping. A tsunami
  warning was issued after a powerful 8.8-magnitude quake struck a remote part
  of the Russian coast. Authorities put out the alert over concerns that
  destructive waves could slam the shoreline in the coming hours, urging people
  to move away from the coast. Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action. “I
  went to higher ground just in case,” she said. Her family lives in the lower
  area of Tamuning and they moved to a more elevated part of the village. She
  joined other residents who evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of
  Hagåtña, the capital of the US island, in the western Pacific ocean. In
  villages, towns and cities across the world’s largest ocean, from Russian and
  Chinese ports, to Japanese fishing communities, to coastal cities across the
  US west coast and further south in Latin America, warnings and evacuation
  orders rang out after the quake, one of the strongest recorded. Workers were
  sent home and businesses locked down as they braced for what might hit in the
  hours ahead. In Guam, residents were urged to remain out of the water and told
  to move away from beaches and harbours, at least 100ft (30 metres) inland and
  50ft above sea level. The port authority and other government agencies
  suspended operations, while marina users and local residents were told to
  evacuate to higher ground. Workers in some businesses – including the Guam
  visitors bureau in the coastal district of Tumon – were sent home. But some
  were not worried by the warnings. Tessa Borja, a policy analyst from Tumon,
  did not feel evacuating was necessary and stayed in her second-floor
  apartment. “We are protected by the reef,” she said. Over the course of
  Wednesday, governments in many countries, including the US and Japan,
  downgraded their initial tsunami alerts, but not until after countless people
  across multiple time zones had fled as a precaution, many in the middle of the
  night. In Japan, footage by the public broadcaster NHK showed many people in
  the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under
  tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential
  damage from the incoming waves. About 200 people in Japan evacuated to a
  Buddhist temple that sits on high ground overlooking Kamaishi, in Iwate
  prefecture, a city that lost about 1,250 residents in the devastating March
  2011 tsunami. The Senjuin temple is a designated municipal tsunami evacuation
  area. The chief priest, Keio Shibasaki, told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper:
  Considering that more than 1,000 people took refuge here after the [2011]
  earthquake, the number of evacuees is relatively small, but we have started
  preparing lunch with stored food in case of unforeseen circumstances such as
  power outages. We are prepared for a long stay. Evacuees included staff from
  the city hall, post office, and children and teachers from the nearby Kamaishi
  kindergarten. “We evacuated when the tsunami warning was issued,” the
  kindergarten head, Keito Fujiwara, told the Mainichi Shimbun. We stored
  emergency food supplies at the temple and have been preparing accordingly.
  During the 2011 earthquake, there were cases where parents went to pick up
  their children and became victims, so we communicated via group LINE [a
  popular Japanese messaging app] that under no circumstances should anyone go
  to pick up their children. In 2011, the tsunami waves swept over the Kamaishi
  tsunami protection breakwater, a decades-long $1.5bn project that had been
  completed two years previously, inundating the city in scenes that were
  captured on video and seen around the world. How does the 8.8-magnitude
  earthquake off the coast of Russia compare with past temblors? Here’s a glance
  at some of the most powerful earthquakes recorded previously, according to the
  US Geological Survey. An expedition group from the Russian Geographical
  Society was on the Kuril island of Shumshu when the tsunami swept away their
  tent camp, AFP reports. “When the wave hit, all we could do was run to higher
  ground. It’s very difficult to do that in boots on slippery grass and in fog,”
  group member Vera Kostamo told Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. “All the
  tents and structures were swept away by the wave, and our belongings were
  scattered across the beach for hundreds of metres. We have no casualties,
  everyone acted quickly, but we lost all our belongings.” Authorities in the
  Sakhalin region, which includes the northern Kuril Islands, declared a state
  of emergency. As we’ve been reporting, a tsunami wave swept through
  Severo-Kurilsk, a coastal Russian town on an island close to Japan, carrying
  buildings and debris into the sea. Giant waves crashed through the port area
  and submerged a fishing plant in the town of about 2,000 people, some 350
  kilometres (217 miles) southwest of the earthquake’s underwater epicentre,
  according to authorities. The epicentre of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake was 47
  kilometres (30 miles) beneath sea level and sent shock waves at a range of 300
  kilometres (200 miles), Russia’s geophysical survey told state news agency RIA
  Novosti. The waves, which were up to four metres high in some areas, reached
  as far as the town’s World War II monument about 400 metres (1,312 feet) from
  the shoreline, according to mayor of Severo-Kurilsk, Alexander Ovsyannikov.
  Most of the town lies on higher ground safe from flooding, he added. “Everyone
  was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated,
  all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” AFP reports he said at a
  crisis meeting with officials earlier. A tsunami warning for Kamchatka was
  lifted later on Wednesday. Authorities in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands on
  Wednesday ordered the precautionary evacuation of people living in vulnerable
  coastal areas, after the massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunami
  warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Authorities in the islands, some 970 km
  (600 miles) off the Ecuadorian coast, said people living in these vulnerable
  areas should make their ways to safe zones established by the country’s
  emergency management agency. A team of medics was in the middle of surgery in
  the far eastern Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky when one of the
  strongest earthquakes ever recorded shook their equipment and the floor
  beneath them. The medics used their hands to try to steady both the patient
  and their equipment, CCTV footage released by the Kamchatka region’s health
  ministry showed. “Despite the danger, the doctors remained calm and stayed
  with the patient until the very end,” Oleg Melnikov, the health minister,
  wrote on Telegram. He gave no details of the surgery but said the patient was
  out of danger. Regional governor Vladimir Solodov said on Telegram he would
  nominate the doctors for state awards, adding: Such courage deserves the
  highest praise. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been no
  casualties in Russia from the 8.8 magnitude earthquake, crediting solid
  building construction and the smooth working of alert systems. Still, there
  were scenes of chaos along Russia’s remote and sparsely populated far eastern
  seaboard, and scattered reports of damage. Roman Kripakov, a chef in
  Severo-Kurilsk on Paramushir, one of the Pacific Kuril Islands chain, said he
  was at the cafe where he works when it began to shake. “We ran out onto the
  street, and saw that all the buildings were trembling. Pipes, bricks, they
  were all falling down from the roofs,” he told Reuters. “Did I think about
  death? Yes, it did come to mind. I asked everyone for forgiveness, and
  recalled happy moments in my life. I wrote to my wife.” A verified video shot
  by a Severo-Kurilsk resident showed water engulfing a fish processing plant as
  it rushed inland, carrying a lightweight metal building and containers with
  it. A woman can be heard cursing as she laments the loss of the plant. “Our
  factory is sinking along with our seafood production,” she says. Elsewhere on
  the Kamchatka Peninsula, video showed startled sea lions diving into the sea
  as the quake hit Antsiferov Island, just off the coast. The island is known as
  a natural habitat for Steller sea lions, a large, near-threatened species.
  Here is a short recap summary of events so far today: A powerful magnitude 8.8
  earthquake off Russia’s far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami
  waves of up to 5 metres (16 feet) nearby and sparked evacuation orders as far
  away as Hawaii and across the Pacific on Wednesday. The tsunami wave swept
  away buildings on the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk, the main settlement on
  Russia’s Kuril Islands in the Pacific. The regional authorities declared a
  state of emergency but mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said all residents were
  safe and had been evacuated. The country’s emergency ministry said parts of
  the town had been flooded. The tsunami alert was later cancelled in Russia’s
  Severo-Kurilsk, state-owned Tass news agency reports. More than two million
  people were evacuated in Japan, including workers at the stricken Fukushima
  nuclear plant in northeast Japan, who were evacuated, with plant operator
  Tepco saying that “no abnormality” had been observed at the site. The
  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said initial reports indicate no
  safety impact for nuclear power plants along the Pacific Coast, Reuters
  reports Japan later lifted all tsunami warnings, downgrading them to a tsunami
  advisory, Reuters reports, citing the Japan Meteorological Agency. Broadcaster
  Asahi TV reported a 58-year-old woman died when her car fell off a cliff while
  she was evacuating in central Japan’s Mie prefecture, Reuters reports. Hawaii
  downgraded its tsunami warning to advisory and lifted its evacuation order
  with people able to return to their homes. The Klyuchevskoy volcano on the
  Kamchatka peninsula in Russia’s far east has started erupting after
  Wednesday’s powerful earthquake in the Pacific, Russian state news agency RIA
  reported, according to Reuters. Authorities in Central and South America have
  ordered evacuations and issued tsunami warnings. Tsunami waves began hitting
  the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia early on Wednesday, but the waves
  were forecast to be smaller than initially feared, local authorities said. The
  National Tsunami Warning Centre (NTWC) said a tsunami advisory has been
  cancelled for coastal areas of south Alaska, the Alaska peninsula and the
  Aleutian Islands from Chignik Bay, Alaska to the Samalga Pass. The NTWC said a
  tsunami advisory has been cancelled for the coastal areas of British Columbia
  from the Washington/British Columbia border to the British Columbia/Alaska
  border. A tsunami advisory is now cancelled for American Samoa, Reuters
  reports. This graphic shows earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or above over the
  past 125 years: Tsunami waves began hitting the Marquesas Islands in French
  Polynesia early on Wednesday, but the waves were forecast to be smaller than
  initially feared, local authorities said. The highest wave heights are yet to
  come, but they are now expected to reach 1.10-2.50 metres, down from a
  previous forecast of up to 4 metres, the High Commission of the Republic in
  French Polynesia said. Some initial wave surges were reported on the island of
  Nuku Hiva, and between five and 10 additional ocean waves are expected in the
  coming hours, the high commission said. The NTWC said a tsunami advisory is
  now cancelled for American Samoa, Reuters reports. We have more from the
  National Tsunami Warning Centre (NTWC). The NTWC said a tsunami advisory has
  been cancelled for the coastal areas of British Columbia from the
  Washington/British Columbia border to the British Columbia/Alaska border,
  Reuters reports. The National Tsunami Warning Centre (NTWC) said a tsunami
  advisory has been cancelled for coastal areas of south Alaska, the Alaska
  peninsula and the Aleutian Islands from Chignik Bay, Alaska to Samalga Pass,
  Reuters reports. Tsunami alerts from Japan to the US after earthquake sparks
  warnings across Pacific – video report The Russian Academy of Sciences’ United
  Geophysical Service has confirmed earlier reports of the Klyuchevskoy volcano
  on Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula erupting, Reuters reports. The event comes
  after Wednesday’s powerful earthquake in the Pacific. In a statement posted on
  Telegram, the geological monitoring service said: A descent of burning hot
  lava is observed on the western slope. Powerful glow above the volcano,
  explosions. Located about 450 km (280 miles) north of the regional capital,
  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Klyuchevskoy is one of the highest volcanoes in the
  world. It has erupted several times in recent years. Wednesday’s 8.8 magnitude
  quake off Kamchatka damaged buildings and injured several people in the remote
  Russian region, but no fatalities were reported. Here are some images coming
  to us over the wires: At Inage Beach in Chiba prefecture in Japan, officials
  have set up a security perimeter, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. One
  rescue worker told AFP the seaside area was off limits until further notice.
  The Klyuchevskoy volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia’s far east has
  started erupting after Wednesday’s powerful earthquake in the Pacific, Russian
  state news agency RIA reported, according to Reuters. The volcano is known to
  be the tallest active volcano in Eurasia. The massive quake struck on
  Wednesday morning in Russia, generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres (13ft) on
  the country’s east coast, damaging buildings and prompting evacuation warnings
  in the region and across most of Japan’s east coast, officials said. Shown
  below is an image of a previous eruption of the Klyuchevskoy volcano in
  October 2023, which led to schools in nearby towns closing as a result of the
  huge ash columns. Broadcaster Asahi TV reported a 58-year-old woman died when
  her car fell off a cliff while she was evacuating in central Japan’s Mie
  prefecture, Reuters reports. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said no
  injuries or damage had been reported, and there were no irregularities at any
  nuclear plants. But hundreds of thousands of commuters in Tokyo and
  surrounding areas faced being stranded as they headed home, with operations on
  railway lines along the Pacific coast remaining halted. Japan has lifted all
  tsunami warnings, downgrading them to a tsunami advisory, Reuters reports,
  citing the Japan Meteorological Agency. Authorities in Central and South
  America have ordered evacuations and issued tsunami warnings after the
  magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia’s eastern coast. In Colombia,
  the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said strong currents and
  tsunami waves were expected along the country’s Pacific coastline between
  Wednesday morning and lunchtime. The unit called for a precautionary
  evacuation of beaches and areas of low tide in the western departments of
  Nariño and Chocó. “Please get yourselves to high places away from the coast,”
  it asked on X. In Chile, the education ministry suspended classes at schools
  along parts of its Pacific coast while the National Disaster Prevention and
  Response Service issued a yellow alert for a possible tsunami. The service’s
  director, Alicia Cebrián, told reporters that the waves were first expected to
  hit Easter Island on Wednesday morning. “This information is dynamic and being
  permanently monitored,” Cebrián said, adding that evacuations would take place
  three hours before. In Panama, Omar Smith Gallardo, the head of the National
  Civil Protection System, called for calm and urged residents of the Pacific
  coast to stay away from the coast until lunchtime. Panama had not been
  affected by larger earthquakes in the past but it was not possible to
  guarantee “100%” that would be the case this time. Ecuador’s Oceanographic
  Institute of the Navy announced there was an “imminent danger” of a tsunami
  and said 1.4m waves were expected to hit the Galápagos Islands on Wednesday
  morning with larger waves potentially following. We have updates on some of
  Russia’s tsunami warnings from Reuters. Russia has lifted the tsunami warning
  for Sakhalin, according to local authorities Russia has lifted tsunami warning
  for Kamchatka, according to IFX. The tsunami alert has been cancelled in
  Russia’s Severo-Kurilsk, state-owned Tass news agency reports. The Kremlin has
  said alert systems “worked well” in the earthquake response and there were “no
  casualties”, Reuters reports. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
  has said initial reports indicate no safety impact for nuclear power plants
  along the Pacific Coast, Reuters reports. The National Weather Service in Los
  Angeles said the Port San Luis gauge “shows a rapid and damaging surge, going
  from low to high tide in just a few minutes”. In a post on X it added: Do not
  return to inundated areas as waters will recede, but could return multiple
  times through the next 24 hours, and the first wave may not be the largest.
  Waves of up to 4 metres are expected to hit the Marquesas Islands in French
  Polynesia in the early hours of Wednesday, AFP reports citing local
  authorities. Waves ranging from “1.10 metres to 4 metres” on the island of
  Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas archipelago are expected overnight from around 1am
  local time (11.00 GMT), the High Commission of the French Republic in French
  Polynesia said in a statement, adding that the islands of Ua Huka and Hiva Oa
  are also expected to be affected. We have more from Japan’s weather agency. It
  has downgraded tsunami alerts issued for a wide swathe of the archipelago
  while keeping warnings unchanged for its northern areas, AFP reports. Warnings
  for eastern Japan’s Ibaraki region all the way down to the southern Wakayama
  region have now been downgraded to “advisories”, Japan’s weather agency said
  on its website. Here are some images coming to us over the wires: AFP is
  reporting that Japan has downgraded tsunami alerts for many areas, citing its
  weather office. There is no further tsunami threat to Guam, Rota, Tinian or
  Saipan, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said, Reuters is reporting.
  Tsunami waves of 3.6 ft (one metre) observed at Crescent City, California,
  Reuters reports, citing the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC). Local
  authorities in French Polynesia have issued a tsunami warning for the
  Marquesas Islands archipelago, with waves of 1.10 to 2.20 metres expected to
  hit the islands of Ua Huka, Nuku Hiva, and Hiva Oa overnight from Tuesday to
  Wednesday, Reuters reports. Residents were urged to move to higher ground and
  follow official instructions, including securing boats or moving them away
  from the shore. Other archipelagos in French Polynesia may be affected by
  waves less than 30cm high, which do not require evacuation or sheltering,
  local authorities said. The Oahu Emergency Management Agency (EMA) said that
  the evacuation order had been lifted and it was safe to return to previously
  evacuated areas, Reuters reports. The EMA added that there was “no report of
  big damage”. Flights have restarted at Honolulu international airport in
  Hawaii, the Hawaii transportation department said, Reuters reports. The
  Hawaiian Emergency Management Agency (EMA) announced that commercial harbours
  will also reopen. Hawaii’s tsunami warning has been downgraded to an advisory
  with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) adding that “a major tsunami is
  not expected to strike the state of Hawaii”. The PTWC, operated by the
  National Weather Service, said in an alert: Based on all available data a
  major tsunami is not expected to strike the state of hawaii. However...sea
  level changes and strong currents may occur along all coasts that could be a
  hazard to swimmers and boaters as well as to persons near the shore at beaches
  and in harbors and marinas. Tsunami waves of 1.6 ft (0.5 metres) above tide
  level have been observed in Arena Cove in the US state of California, the US
  National Weather Service has said. It said that the tsunami warning remains in
  effect for the coastal areas of California from Cape Mendocino, California, to
  the Oregon/California border. It added: If you are located in this coastal
  area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with
  significant inundation is possible or is already occurring. Tsunamis are a
  series of waves dangerous many hours after initial arrival time. The first
  wave may not be the largest. Reuters has snapped the following: US embassy to
  Papua New Guinea: tsunami threat alert in Papua New Guinea, Solomon islands,
  and Vanuatu. by Jon Letman in Hawaii, Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam, Bryan
  Manabat in Saipan and Gavin Blair in Tokyo In the Pacific territory of Guam,
  just before lunchtime on Tuesday, Sam Mabini’s phone began to ping. A tsunami
  warning was issued after a powerful 8.8-magnitude quake struck a remote part
  of the Russian coast. Authorities put out the alert over concerns that
  destructive waves could slam the shoreline in the coming hours, urging people
  to move away from the coast. Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action. “I
  went to higher ground just in case,” Mabini said. Her family lives in the
  lower area of Tamuning and they moved to a more elevated part of the village.
  She joined other residents who evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of
  Guam’s capital, Hagåtña. In towns and cities across the Pacific, from Guam to
  Saipan and Hawaii, warnings and evacuation orders rang after the quake, one of
  the strongest ever recorded. Workers were sent home and businesses locked down
  as they braced for what might hit in the hours ahead. Read the full report
  here: Here are some images coming to us over the wires. New Zealand’s
  emergency management agency has issued a low-level threat warning for
  residents all around the nation’s coastline. The agency said it expected
  “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore” after the
  Russian earthquake. A warning said: “People in or near the sea in the
  following areas should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas and
  away from harbours, marinas, rivers and estuaries.” People on boats,
  live-aboards and in marinas should move onto the shore, the warning said,
  adding that people should not go to the coast to watch for any waves coming
  in. The Kahului Maui gauge in Hawaii recorded a tsunami amplitude of 4 ft (1.2
  metres) relative to normal sea level, Reuters reports citing PTWC. Here is
  some more from the press conference from Hawaii governor Josh Green. “We have
  still not seen any wave activity come past the big island,” Green said. He
  added: “We expect it to be two to three hours at least until we can call all
  clear.” Green said not to get on the road “at all unless you need to”. Around
  200 people were sheltering at Maui airport, he said. All flights in and out of
  the airport have been cancelled “for tonight”, he added. You can watch the
  press conference here: Hawaii governor Josh Green says airports have not yet
  been impacted by waves, Reuters reports. The Hawaii Emergency Management
  Agency (EMA) said all commercial harbours have been closed, Reuters reports.
  Hawaii governor Josh Green said all flights in and out of Maui have been
  cancelled, Reuters reports. He said there were no plans to shut off any power
  in advance, adding that so far they have not seen a wave of consequence.
  Tsunami waves near the Russian Pacific town of Severo-Kurilsk exceeded 3
  metres (9.84 ft) in height. The most powerful wave reached up to 5 metres
  (16.4 ft), Reuters reports citing the news agency Ria. The Haleiwa gauge in
  Hawaii recorded a tsunami amplitude of 3ft relative to normal sea level,
  Reuters reports, citing PTWC. Tsunami waves are now impacting the state of
  Hawaii. Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property, the
  Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said. If you are just tuning into this
  story, here is a quick explainer of what we know so far. More now from Russia,
  where the mayor of the country’s northern Kuril islands district said on
  Wednesday that “everyone” there had evacuated to safety following a tsunami
  that caused flooding and swept away buildings. “Everyone was evacuated. There
  was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are
  in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis
  meeting with officials. The initial effects of tsunami waves are expected to
  occur soon on Hawaii’s Kauai coast, with effects to Hawaii island about 20-30
  minutes later. Hawaii governor Josh Green said data from Midway Atoll, which
  is part of the way between Japan and Hawaii, measured tsunami waves from peak
  to trough of 6 feet (1.8 meters). He said waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger
  or smaller and it was too early to tell how large they would be. A tsunami of
  that size would be akin to a three foot (90 centimeter) wave riding on top of
  surf, he said. He told a new conference that a wave that size could move cars
  and throw fences around. It can dislodge trees, that’s why you can’t just be
  out there. The impact is at great speed,” Green said. “Any any structure that
  gets loose and strikes the individual could take them out. And people can
  drown quite easily with the force of that kind of wave.” Meanwhile Shanghai is
  grappling with the twin threats of a tropical cyclone and a tsunami, with more
  than 280,000 people relocated from the city, and hundreds of flights and ferry
  services halted on Wednesday. Landfall of tropical cyclone Co-May in the port
  city of Zhoushan in Zhejiang province in the early hours of Wednesday was soon
  followed by warnings of a tsunami set off by a powerful earthquake off
  Russia’s far east, raising concerns of larger-than-expected storm surges along
  the Chinese coast. While the winds from Co-May were weaker than those
  generated by typhoons, the Chinese financial hub and other cities in the
  Yangtze River delta have taken no chances. Russia declares emergency on
  islands hit by tsunami Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region
  declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands, where tsunami
  waves have damaged buildings and caused flooding, AFP reports. First tsunami
  wave expected to hit Hawaii at 7.17pm local time The first tsunami wave is
  expected to hit Hawaii in about half an hour. Gov. Josh Green said
  measurements showed a three-foot wave, above sea level, when the tsunami
  passed Midway Atoll, northwest of Hawaii. Green said in a briefing: This is a
  very serious event. … Please do not put yourself in harm’s way. A quick primer
  on tsunamis from the AP: What is a tsunami? Tsunamis are waves triggered by
  earthquakes, underwater volcanic eruptions and submarine landslides. After an
  underwater earthquake, the seafloor rises and drops, which lifts water up and
  down. The energy from this pushes sea water that transfers to waves. Many
  people think of tsunamis as one wave. But they are typically multiple waves
  that rush ashore like a fast-rising tide. What should I do if I get a tsunami
  alert? Authorities urge people to move to higher ground when they have
  indications a tsunami will arrive. Some communities have buildings designated
  on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school,
  while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside. How long
  does it take for tsunamis to arrive? It depends on how far the epicenter of
  the earthquake is from a coastal area. It could take just minutes for waves to
  hit land next to the site of a major quake. It could take hours for tsunamis
  to cross the Pacific Ocean. The speed of tsunami waves also depends on ocean
  depth. They travel faster over deep water and slow down in shallow water. How
  officials are responding across California tonight Officials across California
  warned residents on Tuesday evening to stay away from the coast, as the US
  west coast braced for waves caused by the earthquake in Russia. A tsunami
  warning, which warns of dangerous coastal flooding, is in effect for the
  state’s far northern coast. A tsunami advisory, which warns of strong currents
  and waves, is in place for the state’s southern coast. Waves are only expected
  to hit the California coast around midnight, but officials in this state that
  has seen its share of natural disasters pleaded with residents to take no
  risks. “Please stay alert and follow instructions from emergency personnel,”
  the California governor, Gavin Newsom, wrote. The LA mayor, Karen Bass, said
  emergency officials as well as police at the Ports of Long Beach and Los
  Angeles were ready to respond. “Residents and workers in and around the L.A.
  Harbor area are urged to stay alert, avoid the waterline, and follow official
  instructions,” she said. Daniel Lurie, the San Francisco mayor, said the Bay
  Area should expect strong and dangerous currents that could impact beaches,
  harbours, docks and piers. “Make sure you and your family are prepared,” he
  added. Ecuador evacuates parts of Galápagos Islands, Peru issues tsunami
  warning The scale of the tsunami’s impacts keeps growing as countries on all
  side of the Pacific Ocean are taking precautionary measures. Peru issued a
  tsunami warning on Tuesday, according to the navy, saying officials will keep
  the situation “under constant surveillance”. And Ecuador ordered preventive
  evacuations of beaches, docks and low-lying areas in the Galápagos Islands off
  its coast late Tuesday, AFP reports. Mexico has also mobilised authorities at
  “all levels of government” to keep people away from Pacific beaches. Hawaii
  governor issues emergency proclamation Hawaii Gov. Josh Green has issued an
  emergency proclamation related to the tsunami and urged residents to heed
  evacuation warnings and not risk being near the shoreline. He said officials
  were monitoring the tsunami as it approaches the Midway Islands, which would
  give them a better sense as to how big waves could be when they reach the
  state in a few hours. Green said on X: People need to evacuate, that’s very
  clear. … Please take this very seriously. Do not risk being out at all near
  the shoreline. Green added in a news briefing that a tsunami wave was “not a
  regular wave”: It will actually kill you if you get hit by a tsunami, so you
  have to be out of that area. Tsunami expected to hit parts of eastern China,
  could cause damage China’s tsunami warning centre said Wednesday that waves of
  between 30cm and 1 metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard,
  AFP reports. The centre said: Based on the latest warning and analysis
  results, the Tsunami Advisory Center of the Ministry of National Resources has
  determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to
  cause damage to certain coastal areas of China. A warning from US weather
  officials: tsunamis are not just one wave The National Weather Service’s Bay
  Area branch issued a sharp warning against complacency surrounding a tsunami,
  warning against people trying to take photos of the event. The agency wrote on
  X: Friends please be aware, a Tsunami is a series of wave[s] carrying a large
  extra mass of water to our coast. This will NOT be a single wave. Do NOT try
  to go to the coast to take photos. You’re not just putting yourself at risk,
  you will also be putting rescue teams at risk. In case you’re overwhelmed by
  the sheer scope of updates across the Pacific, here’s a quick primer on what’s
  been going on today: Earthquake off Russia sets off tsunami warning sirens in
  Honolulu – video A tsunami warning has been issued for part of the California
  coastline. The warning stretches from Cape Mendocino up to the state’s border
  with Oregon. More than 900,000 under evacuation advisories in Japan Japan’s
  Fire and Disaster Management Agency said no injuries or damages have been
  reported so far, the AP reports. The agency has issued an evacuation advisory
  to more than 900,000 people in 133 municipalities along the Japanese
  coastline, stretching from Hokkaido to Okinawa. It’s unclear how many people
  actually took shelter. More from Jon Letman: Hawaii residents have become
  particularly sensitive to cell phone warning and civil defence sirens after
  Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency issued a false alert warning of an
  inbound “ballistic missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic. All
  islands have activated their Emergency Operating Centers, shelters are
  opening, and everyone in coastal areas is being advised to head to higher
  ground immediately. Kauai Police are asking the public to stay off the road
  unless absolutely necessary and advising of the closure of the westbound lane
  on Hanalei Bridge, with the eastbound land open for evacuations. Reporter Jon
  Letman is in from Kauai, Hawaii. He said tsunami warning sirens blared for a
  second time at 4:10 p.m (local time) and could be heard on multiple islands
  including Oahu and Kauai. Kyle Kajihiro, assistant professor at the University
  of Hawaii-Manoa, was on campus when he received a warning alert on his cell
  phone. Kajihiro said the campus was shutting down and traffic on Honolulu’s
  highways was noticeably heavy. On Kauai, shortly after the tsunami warning was
  issued, staff at the National Tropical Botanical Garden suspended tours on its
  south shore and moved all visitors and staff out of the inundation zone to
  higher ground. Blue skies and breezy conditions prevailed even as many Hawaii
  residents left work early heading for home or designated safe areas away from
  the islands’ heavily populated coastline. Russia appears to be the worst hit
  by the major earthquake so far, with some reported damage near the quake’s
  epicentre in Kamchatka. Footage showed a damaged kindergarten in the area, as
  well as waves sweeping inland in a port town nearby. There were also reports
  of waves up to four metres high in the remote region. But local officials have
  not yet reported any serious injuries. Oleg Melnikov, a regional health
  minister in Russia, said some people were hurt running outside and in other
  minor incidents, Reuters reports. But he said all patients “are currently in
  satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far”.
  Many along the Japanese coastline were waiting for waves to hit in the coming
  hour, and tsunami warnings remain in place for parts of Alaska and Hawaii.
  People gather on a rooftop after a tsunami alert in Japan – video Russian
  scientists call quake a ‘unique event’, warn aftershocks could last for up to
  a month In a statement posted on the Telegram channel for the local branch of
  the Geophysical Survey of the Russian Academy of Sciences’, the group called
  the earthquake a “unique event.” They said the epicentre was near a recent
  earthquake that struck the peninsula on 20 July, the AP reports. While the
  situation “was under control,” they said there are risks of aftershocks, which
  could last for up to a month, and warned against visiting certain coastal
  areas. Quake off Russia’s far east was region’s ‘strongest since 1952’, local
  agency says An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia’s far east coast early
  Wednesday was the region’s strongest since 1952, with aftershocks of up to 7.5
  magnitude possible, the regional seismic monitoring service said, per Agency
  France-Presse. Kamchatka’s geophysical service said: The strongest earthquake
  since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale
  of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be
  expected. Some scenes from Honolulu amid evacuation alerts for coastal areas:
  Earthquake now classified as magnitude 8.8, USGS says The USGS has updated its
  preliminary readings of the earthquake off the coast of Kamchatka this
  morning, and now classifies it as a magnitude 8.8. More than a dozen other,
  smaller quakes have since shaken the region. The 8.8 magnitude quake, if
  officially confirmed, would see the temblor in the top 10 largest earthquakes
  ever recorded. A post on X from Hawaii’s department of transportation notes
  that the coast guard has advised all vessels to leave port. That advisory is
  for all islands. The first waves in Hawaii were expected around 7pm local
  time, which is in about two and a half hours from now. Donald Trump has posted
  on Truth Social urging Americans to “stay strong and stay safe” following the
  tsunami warnings for Hawaii, Alaska and the Pacific coast of the US. “Due to a
  massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in
  effect for those living in Hawaii. A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and
  the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit
  tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!” he wrote.
  Some images are coming through from Japan: Workers at the stricken Fukushima
  nuclear plant in northeast Japan were evacuated Wednesday, according to AFP.
  “We have evacuated all workers and employees” at the Fukushima Daiichi plant –
  which went into meltdown after being hit by a tsunami in 2011 – a spokesperson
  for plant operator TEPCO told the news wire, adding that “no abnormality” had
  been observed at the site. A tsunami hit Russia’s far east coast on Wednesday,
  flooding a port town home to around 2,000 people, Russia’s emergencies
  ministry said. “The tsunami flooded parts of the port town of Severo-Kurilsk
  ... The population has been evacuated,” the ministry said in a statement. A
  video posted on Russian social media appeared to show buildings in the town
  submerged in sea water. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has added Australia
  to its advisory, saying waves of 0.3 to 1m are possible along the coast.
  However, the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre has not issued a warning
  for the country as of 11.25am AEST. Photo shows damaged kindergarten in
  Kamchatka, Russia The first waves from the tsunami have hit the coastline of
  Hokkaido in northern Japan. Broadcaster NHK reported the waves measured around
  30cm. Officials in multiple countries have issued warnings that subsequent
  waves could be much higher. The National Tsunami Warning Center has issued a
  tsunami advisory for the entire West Coast of the US up into Canada and
  Alaska. The advisory stretches from California’s border with Mexico up through
  Oregon and Washington and into British Columbia in Canada before continuing to
  South Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula. This USGS map shows the spreading
  tsunami warnings, advisories, watches and threats as concern spreads across
  the Pacific. The first waves to hit Nemuro-Hanasaki Port in Hokkaido, Japan
  are estimated to have a height of 30cm, according to public broadcaster NHK.
  People in Kamaishi, Iwate Prefecture and Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, two of
  the cities that suffered the worst devastation from the 2011 tsunami, have
  evacuated to the same safe spots on higher ground used by survivors of that
  disaster, also per NHK. New Zealand warns of strong currents and surges after
  earthquake New Zealand can expect strong and unusual currents and
  unpredictable surges at the shore, following an earthquake off the coast of
  Russia, New Zealand’s national emergency management agency (NEMA) has warned.
  NEMA said: Strong currents and surges can injure and drown people. There is a
  danger to swimmers, surfers, people fishing, and anyone in or near the water
  close to shore. People in or near the sea in the following areas should move
  out of the water, off beaches and shore areas and away from harbours, marinas,
  rivers and estuaries. Most of the country’s coastline is under threat, NEMA
  said, however there was no need for anyone to evacuate unless directly advised
  by local civil defence authorities. The surges are expected to reach New
  Zealand around midnight local time. Tsunami sirens blaring in Honolulu Tsunami
  warning sirens are blaring in Honolulu, AP reports. People are being told to
  move to higher ground, or go to the 4th floor or above in a building at least
  10 storeys high. Bryan Manabat, a reporter in Saipan, says residents are
  closely monitoring the tsunami watch announcement. Saipan is the largest
  island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, with a population of
  around 43,000 people. Manabat says after the passing of a tropical storm
  recently, shorelines in Saipan have seen heavy soil erosion. He says some
  Saipan residents living near the shoreline in Beach Road, Garapan, plan to
  evacuate to higher ground now and just wait for an all clear notice from
  authorities. Authorities say the potential impacts of tsunami waves could be
  minor flooding of beach and harbour areas: strong and unusual ocean currents
  in bays and near other shore waters. Manabat says tsunami drills by emergency
  authorities have been held regularly in Saipan in recent years. A bit more
  detail from reporter Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam – residents have been told to
  “remain out of the water”. They have been told to move away from beaches and
  harbours, at least 100 feet inland and 50 feet above sea level. Ecuador is now
  among the countries that could be hit by tsunami waves from a huge earthquake
  off the coast of Russia, the US Tsunami Warning Center said Tuesday. Ecuador
  in South America and the east coast of Russia could be struck by waves of more
  than three meters (10 feet) triggered by the 8.7 magnitude earthquake, the
  center said. More strong quakes recorded off Russian coastline At least six
  earthquakes have now hit off the coast of Kamchatka today, the USGS says. They
  have all been strong with initial readings of magnitude 6.9, 6.3, 5.4, 5.7 and
  5.6. But they do not compare to the massive, magnitude 8.7 temblor that set
  off a tsunami. To provide information to Japan’s growing foreign-born
  population, public broadcaster NHK is delivering updates in its television
  coverage in multiple languages: English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese,
  Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog (for Filipinos), accompanied by graphics, as
  well as in sign language. The broadcasts including warnings that even a
  tsunami of 50cm can be strong enough to sweep a person away. Hawaii officials
  order evacuation of coastal areas around Honolulu Officials in Hawaii have
  ordered an immediate evacuation of large parts of the coastline of Oahu,
  including coastal areas of Honolulu. A full map of the Oahu evacuation zones
  is here. Japan’s evacuation warnings span hundreds of kilometres, with
  official urging those near the coast to seek safety Yoshimasa Hayashi, chief
  cabinet secretary, said: Those near the coast should evacuate immediately to
  higher ground or safe buildings in the areas covered by the tsunami warning
  from Hokkaido to Wakayama Prefecture [hundreds of kilometres to the south].
  Please be aware that after the initial wave, second and third waves of
  tsunamis can be even higher. A tsunami warning has been issued for the state
  of Hawaii. Officials say it could cause “damage along coastlines of all
  islands in the state”, warning “urgent action should be taken to protect lives
  and property”. The US Tsunami Warning System said: The danger can continue for
  many hours after the initial wave as subsequent waves arrive. Tsunami wave
  heights cannot be predicted and the first wave may not be the largest. The
  alert for Guam has now been updated to a tsunami advisory, per the USGS. A map
  of the region where the earthquake struck Reporter Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam
  said the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has put a “tsunami watch” in effect
  for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. The tsunami threat to Guam, Rota,
  Tinian, and Saipan from this earthquake is still being evaluated, it said. In
  a statement, the Center advised people to “stay alert” for further information
  and the tsunami watch could be cancelled or elevated to an advisory or
  warning. If a tsunami threat exists, the earliest estimated arrival time of
  tsunami waves within Guam, Rota, Tinian, or Saipan, would be 2:37 p.m. local
  time, it said. TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company), operator of the Fukushima
  nuclear plant that suffered a triple meltdown triggered by the 2011 tsunami,
  has announced that discharge of treated water contaminated by the disaster has
  been suspended until today’s tsunami warnings are lifted. Personnel engaged in
  the ongoing decommissioning work at the plant have also been temporarily
  evacuated. Japan has ordered immediate evacuations for parts of the country,
  saying tsunami waves are approaching the coasts, NHK reports. Tsunami warnings
  are in effect for a major stretch of Japan’s eastern Pacific coast, from
  Hokkaido’s eastern Pacific coast down to Wakayama Prefecture. Japan has
  upgraded to a tsunami warning following the quake. Russia says a tsunami with
  waves of 3 to 4 metres has hit parts of the Kamchatka region near the
  earthquake’s epicentre, Reuters reports. Per the latest alerts: Russia could
  see waves greater than 3 metres. Japan could see waves of 1 to 3 metres.
  Hawaii could see waves of 1 to 3 metres. Pacific islands including Midway
  Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra Island could see waves of 1 to 3 metres.
  Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Philippines could see waves of 0.3 to 1
  metres. Earthquake was magnitude 8.7, USGS says The earthquake this morning
  has been upgraded to a magnitude 8.7, the USGS says. USGS confirms tsunami,
  issues warnings for parts of Alaska The USGS has confirmed a tsunami and
  issued an immediate tsunami warning for parts of Alaska. The warning is in
  effect for the Samalga Pass near the state’s Aleutian Islands. Japan warns
  people to stay away from shore along Pacific coast Authorities in Japan have
  issued warnings for people to stay away from the shore and not go into the sea
  for most of the Pacific coastline. Tsunami waves of up to 1 metre are being
  predicted to hit Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, at 10am local time,
  and then strike further south between 10.30am and 11.30am. Prime minister
  Ishiba was informed of the earthquake at 08.37am, and a government emergency
  committee was established shortly afterwards to collect information and
  coordinate responses. Japan has boosted its entire disaster detection, warning
  and response infrastructure in the wake of the massive 2011 earthquake and
  tsunami. A kindergarten has been damaged as a result of the earthquake off
  Kamchatka, the regional governor has said, but so far no injuries have been
  reported. Vladimir Solodov urged people to move away from the coastline saying
  the earthquake was the “strongest in decades” in the area. A tsunami alert has
  been issued for Pacific islands, Russia and Japan after a magnitude 8
  earthquake struck off Russia’s Kamchatka on Wednesday, the US Geological
  Survey says. The quake was shallow and strong enough to cause waves or a
  tsunami, it said. There was a tsunami threat to the Northern Mariana islands
  of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan, it said.

Tsunami alerts remain in effect in coastal parts of Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, and for Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, following the massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia’s far eastern coast – one of the strongest ever recorded – on Wednesday. Most earlier warnings were lifted or downgraded in most other parts of the world as the day went on, including for Japan, the US, Russia, the Philippines, and others, after the impact of the water surges was less than initially feared. Authorities ordered evacuations from vulnerable coastal areas to safe zones on Ecuador and Chile’s Pacific islands on Wednesday, after the massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Waves recently begun to hit Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands with heights of about 1 meter and 0.4 meters were reportedly recorded in the islands of Baltra and Santacruz. Residents and tourists on Chile’s Easter Island evacuated to a church on higher ground, while evacuations began along the mainland’s Pacific coast. Chile also evacuated five prisons due to their location at low elevations. Meanwhile in French Polynesia, local authorities lifted the tsunami alert in the remote Marquesas Islands. They said people could return to their homes, but should remain cautious. Tsunami waves had begun hitting early in the day, but were smaller than initially feared, authorities said. In the US, major flooding had been avoided in the northern California community of Crescent City that experienced the highest tsunami waves on the west coast (around 8 feet tall), the city manager, Eric Wier, said. “It was a long night for all of us,” he said. “We were fortunate this time.” You can read our latest news story here: Chile is evacuating five prisons as the country remains on high alert for possible tsunamis. Senapred, Chile’s national disaster response agency, said in a statement on their website that all five are being evacuated due to their location at low elevations. The inmates will be transferred to other prisons as part of Chile’s natural emergency protocol, interior minister Álvaro Elizalde told CNN Chile. Waves have started to hit Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands, according to data from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) reported by CNN. Wave heights of about 1 meter and 0.4 meters were reportedly recorded in the islands of Baltra and Santacruz. Tsunami advisories have been cancelled for coastal areas of California – from Ragged Point to Humboldt/Del Norte – Oregon and Washington. Local authorities lifted the tsunami alert in the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia on Wednesday, Reuters repors, and said people could return to their homes, but said residents should remain cautious. Tsunami waves had begun hitting early on Wednesday, but were smaller than initially feared, authorities said. The High Commission of the Republic in French Polynesia said wave heights had reached 1.50 metres, down from a previous forecast of up to 4 metres. Additional smaller waves were expected in the coming hours, officials said. Elsewhere in French Polynesia, wave heights were expected to remain below 30cm. However, residents are urged to stay away from shorelines and river mouths. The Marquesas Islands, among the most remote in the world, have a population of approximately 9,500, according to a 2022 census. French Polynesia’s five archipelagos comprise 118 islands but have a total land area of only about 4,200 sq km. There have been around 125 aftershocks of 4.4-magnitude or greater near Russia since the 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the country’s coast, data from the US Geological Survey shows. Strong aftershocks continue to rock the region, with a 6.4-magnitude one striking some 200 miles south-west of the epicenter of yesterday’s quake at about 11am ET on Wednesday. Aftershocks are usually strongest shortly after the main earthquake and lessen as time goes on. Authorities ordered evacuations on Ecuador and Chile’s Pacific islands on Wednesday, after the massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Residents and tourists on Chile’s Easter Island, located some 3,700 km (2,300 miles) off South America’s western coast, evacuated to a church on higher ground, while evacuations began along the mainland’s Pacific coast. In Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, some 970 km (600 miles) west of the mainland, the government ordered that people living in vulnerable coastal areas make their way to safe zones established by the country’s emergency management agency. Tsunami warnings are still in effect for: Chile: upgraded its tsunami warning for most of its Pacific coast to the highest level Easter Island: residents told to evacuate to safe zones Colombia: issued a red alert in its northeastern Chocó and Nariño regions. Officials have called for evacuation of beaches and low-tide areas Peru: issued a tsunami alert for its Pacific coastline Tsunami alerts also remain in effect for: French Polynesia: issued a tsunami alert for the Marquesas Islands archipelago Galápagos Islands: visitor sites temporarily closed amid tsunami alert, and precautionary evacuation of vulnerable coastal areas such as beaches, docks, and other low-lying areas ordered Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu Tsunami advisories are in effect for: Mexico: authorities issued a tsunami advisory for its Pacific coast as a preventative measure Japan: lifted all tsunami warnings, however a tsunami advisory remains in effect for Pacific coast regions from Hokkaido to Kyushu US: tsunami warnings have been downgraded but advisories remain in effect in parts of California, Hawaii, Alaska and Oregon Tsunami warnings and advisories lifted in: Japan: Japan has lifted all tsunami warnings, according to the country’s meteorological agency Philippines: canceled a tsunami advisory that was issued for several coastal communities across the country Russia: authorities in the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula said a tsunami warning had been lifted, more than 11 hours after the 8.8 magnitude earthquake prompted evacuations Canada: tsunami advisory canceled for British Columbia coast Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands Locations across Micronesia, Australia and New Zealand are also in the clear In the US, the northern California beach community that experienced the highest tsunami waves on the west coast has not seen damage so far, according to city officials. “It was a long night for all of us,” said Eric Wier, the city manager of Crescent City. “We were fortunate this time. There was significant tsunami surges. We’re still dealing with those now, but it did stay within the banks of Elk Creek.” The area saw peak waves of around 8 feet, in line with their highest tides of the year, but not enough to cause flooding inside the central area of the city, Wier said. “The city downtown is at a high enough elevation that it is open,” said Wier. Peruvians received beeping alerts and text messages on their mobile phones from the National Civil Defence Institute warning them to stay away from the beach and telling authorities to close coastal access points along the country’s 1,864-mile (3,000 km) long Pacific-facing coastline. Shortly before, Peru’s Emergency Operations Centre issued a tsunami warning closing 65 ports along the country’s coast, evacuating port workers and restricting fishing and sailing activities from early on Wednesday morning, following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake on the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka. The Peruvian Navy’s Hydrography and Navigation Directorate said waves of between 1 and 2.3 metres will reach the Peruvian coast starting at 10.07am local time, from the north and continue to the south until around 12.30pm. In the capital Lima, the coastal road known as the costanera was closed, though La Punta, a low-lying peninsula in the nearby port district Callao, was not evacuated. Rear Admiral Jorge Vizcarra, spokesperson for the Peruvian Navy, said: “The train of waves will be noticeable, but it will not be high enough to have a significant impact on the population.” Here is a clip of rocks falling down Kamchatka cliffs after the earthquake hit Russia’s far east. In Hawaii, tsunami warning sirens blared twice on Tuesday afternoon on multiple islands, including Oahu, where the capital, Honolulu, is located, and Kauai. Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management warned: “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected.” As residents raced to get out, traffic backed up in some Honolulu neighbourhoods. Even though it is summer break for pupils, some schools issued alerts cancelling sports and other activities. On Kauai, shortly after the tsunami warning was issued, staff at the National Tropical Botanical Garden suspended tours on its south shore and moved all visitors and employees out of the inundation zone to higher ground. Still, blue skies and breezy conditions prevailed as many in Hawaii left work early heading for home or designated safe areas away from the islands’ heavily populated coastline. Residents have become particularly sensitive to phone warnings and civil defence sirens after Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency issued a false alert warning of an inbound “ballistic missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic. All islands activated emergency operating centres, shelters began opening, and people in coastal areas were advised to head to higher ground immediately. Kauai police asked the public to stay off the road unless absolutely necessary. After the waves arrived, they were not as destructive as feared, and Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency said evacuation orders had been lifted and there were no reports of major damage. Bryan Manabat in Saipan In nearby Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, similar warnings were issued. Government offices were closed and businesses in low-lying areas shut their doors. Petrol stations had long lines of vehicles wanting to fill up. Some residents living near the shoreline in Saipan, an island of about 43,000 people, fled to higher ground as they waited for the all clear from authorities. Tsunami drills by emergency authorities have been held regularly in on the island. In the Pacific territory of Guam, shortly before lunchtime on Tuesday, Sam Mabini’s phone began to ping. A tsunami warning was issued after a powerful 8.8-magnitude quake struck a remote part of the Russian coast. Authorities put out the alert over concerns that destructive waves could slam the shoreline in the coming hours, urging people to move away from the coast. Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action. “I went to higher ground just in case,” she said. Her family lives in the lower area of Tamuning and they moved to a more elevated part of the village. She joined other residents who evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of Hagåtña, the capital of the US island, in the western Pacific ocean. In villages, towns and cities across the world’s largest ocean, from Russian and Chinese ports, to Japanese fishing communities, to coastal cities across the US west coast and further south in Latin America, warnings and evacuation orders rang out after the quake, one of the strongest recorded. Workers were sent home and businesses locked down as they braced for what might hit in the hours ahead. In Guam, residents were urged to remain out of the water and told to move away from beaches and harbours, at least 100ft (30 metres) inland and 50ft above sea level. The port authority and other government agencies suspended operations, while marina users and local residents were told to evacuate to higher ground. Workers in some businesses – including the Guam visitors bureau in the coastal district of Tumon – were sent home. But some were not worried by the warnings. Tessa Borja, a policy analyst from Tumon, did not feel evacuating was necessary and stayed in her second-floor apartment. “We are protected by the reef,” she said. Over the course of Wednesday, governments in many countries, including the US and Japan, downgraded their initial tsunami alerts, but not until after countless people across multiple time zones had fled as a precaution, many in the middle of the night. In Japan, footage by the public broadcaster NHK showed many people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves. About 200 people in Japan evacuated to a Buddhist temple that sits on high ground overlooking Kamaishi, in Iwate prefecture, a city that lost about 1,250 residents in the devastating March 2011 tsunami. The Senjuin temple is a designated municipal tsunami evacuation area. The chief priest, Keio Shibasaki, told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper: Considering that more than 1,000 people took refuge here after the [2011] earthquake, the number of evacuees is relatively small, but we have started preparing lunch with stored food in case of unforeseen circumstances such as power outages. We are prepared for a long stay. Evacuees included staff from the city hall, post office, and children and teachers from the nearby Kamaishi kindergarten. “We evacuated when the tsunami warning was issued,” the kindergarten head, Keito Fujiwara, told the Mainichi Shimbun. We stored emergency food supplies at the temple and have been preparing accordingly. During the 2011 earthquake, there were cases where parents went to pick up their children and became victims, so we communicated via group LINE [a popular Japanese messaging app] that under no circumstances should anyone go to pick up their children. In 2011, the tsunami waves swept over the Kamaishi tsunami protection breakwater, a decades-long $1.5bn project that had been completed two years previously, inundating the city in scenes that were captured on video and seen around the world. How does the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia compare with past temblors? Here’s a glance at some of the most powerful earthquakes recorded previously, according to the US Geological Survey. An expedition group from the Russian Geographical Society was on the Kuril island of Shumshu when the tsunami swept away their tent camp, AFP reports. “When the wave hit, all we could do was run to higher ground. It’s very difficult to do that in boots on slippery grass and in fog,” group member Vera Kostamo told Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. “All the tents and structures were swept away by the wave, and our belongings were scattered across the beach for hundreds of metres. We have no casualties, everyone acted quickly, but we lost all our belongings.” Authorities in the Sakhalin region, which includes the northern Kuril Islands, declared a state of emergency. As we’ve been reporting, a tsunami wave swept through Severo-Kurilsk, a coastal Russian town on an island close to Japan, carrying buildings and debris into the sea. Giant waves crashed through the port area and submerged a fishing plant in the town of about 2,000 people, some 350 kilometres (217 miles) southwest of the earthquake’s underwater epicentre, according to authorities. The epicentre of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake was 47 kilometres (30 miles) beneath sea level and sent shock waves at a range of 300 kilometres (200 miles), Russia’s geophysical survey told state news agency RIA Novosti. The waves, which were up to four metres high in some areas, reached as far as the town’s World War II monument about 400 metres (1,312 feet) from the shoreline, according to mayor of Severo-Kurilsk, Alexander Ovsyannikov. Most of the town lies on higher ground safe from flooding, he added. “Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” AFP reports he said at a crisis meeting with officials earlier. A tsunami warning for Kamchatka was lifted later on Wednesday. Authorities in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands on Wednesday ordered the precautionary evacuation of people living in vulnerable coastal areas, after the massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Authorities in the islands, some 970 km (600 miles) off the Ecuadorian coast, said people living in these vulnerable areas should make their ways to safe zones established by the country’s emergency management agency. A team of medics was in the middle of surgery in the far eastern Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky when one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded shook their equipment and the floor beneath them. The medics used their hands to try to steady both the patient and their equipment, CCTV footage released by the Kamchatka region’s health ministry showed. “Despite the danger, the doctors remained calm and stayed with the patient until the very end,” Oleg Melnikov, the health minister, wrote on Telegram. He gave no details of the surgery but said the patient was out of danger. Regional governor Vladimir Solodov said on Telegram he would nominate the doctors for state awards, adding: Such courage deserves the highest praise. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been no casualties in Russia from the 8.8 magnitude earthquake, crediting solid building construction and the smooth working of alert systems. Still, there were scenes of chaos along Russia’s remote and sparsely populated far eastern seaboard, and scattered reports of damage. Roman Kripakov, a chef in Severo-Kurilsk on Paramushir, one of the Pacific Kuril Islands chain, said he was at the cafe where he works when it began to shake. “We ran out onto the street, and saw that all the buildings were trembling. Pipes, bricks, they were all falling down from the roofs,” he told Reuters. “Did I think about death? Yes, it did come to mind. I asked everyone for forgiveness, and recalled happy moments in my life. I wrote to my wife.” A verified video shot by a Severo-Kurilsk resident showed water engulfing a fish processing plant as it rushed inland, carrying a lightweight metal building and containers with it. A woman can be heard cursing as she laments the loss of the plant. “Our factory is sinking along with our seafood production,” she says. Elsewhere on the Kamchatka Peninsula, video showed startled sea lions diving into the sea as the quake hit Antsiferov Island, just off the coast. The island is known as a natural habitat for Steller sea lions, a large, near-threatened species. Here is a short recap summary of events so far today: A powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia’s far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves of up to 5 metres (16 feet) nearby and sparked evacuation orders as far away as Hawaii and across the Pacific on Wednesday. The tsunami wave swept away buildings on the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk, the main settlement on Russia’s Kuril Islands in the Pacific. The regional authorities declared a state of emergency but mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said all residents were safe and had been evacuated. The country’s emergency ministry said parts of the town had been flooded. The tsunami alert was later cancelled in Russia’s Severo-Kurilsk, state-owned Tass news agency reports. More than two million people were evacuated in Japan, including workers at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant in northeast Japan, who were evacuated, with plant operator Tepco saying that “no abnormality” had been observed at the site. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said initial reports indicate no safety impact for nuclear power plants along the Pacific Coast, Reuters reports Japan later lifted all tsunami warnings, downgrading them to a tsunami advisory, Reuters reports, citing the Japan Meteorological Agency. Broadcaster Asahi TV reported a 58-year-old woman died when her car fell off a cliff while she was evacuating in central Japan’s Mie prefecture, Reuters reports. Hawaii downgraded its tsunami warning to advisory and lifted its evacuation order with people able to return to their homes. The Klyuchevskoy volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia’s far east has started erupting after Wednesday’s powerful earthquake in the Pacific, Russian state news agency RIA reported, according to Reuters. Authorities in Central and South America have ordered evacuations and issued tsunami warnings. Tsunami waves began hitting the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia early on Wednesday, but the waves were forecast to be smaller than initially feared, local authorities said. The National Tsunami Warning Centre (NTWC) said a tsunami advisory has been cancelled for coastal areas of south Alaska, the Alaska peninsula and the Aleutian Islands from Chignik Bay, Alaska to the Samalga Pass. The NTWC said a tsunami advisory has been cancelled for the coastal areas of British Columbia from the Washington/British Columbia border to the British Columbia/Alaska border. A tsunami advisory is now cancelled for American Samoa, Reuters reports. This graphic shows earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or above over the past 125 years: Tsunami waves began hitting the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia early on Wednesday, but the waves were forecast to be smaller than initially feared, local authorities said. The highest wave heights are yet to come, but they are now expected to reach 1.10-2.50 metres, down from a previous forecast of up to 4 metres, the High Commission of the Republic in French Polynesia said. Some initial wave surges were reported on the island of Nuku Hiva, and between five and 10 additional ocean waves are expected in the coming hours, the high commission said. The NTWC said a tsunami advisory is now cancelled for American Samoa, Reuters reports. We have more from the National Tsunami Warning Centre (NTWC). The NTWC said a tsunami advisory has been cancelled for the coastal areas of British Columbia from the Washington/British Columbia border to the British Columbia/Alaska border, Reuters reports. The National Tsunami Warning Centre (NTWC) said a tsunami advisory has been cancelled for coastal areas of south Alaska, the Alaska peninsula and the Aleutian Islands from Chignik Bay, Alaska to Samalga Pass, Reuters reports. Tsunami alerts from Japan to the US after earthquake sparks warnings across Pacific – video report The Russian Academy of Sciences’ United Geophysical Service has confirmed earlier reports of the Klyuchevskoy volcano on Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula erupting, Reuters reports. The event comes after Wednesday’s powerful earthquake in the Pacific. In a statement posted on Telegram, the geological monitoring service said: A descent of burning hot lava is observed on the western slope. Powerful glow above the volcano, explosions. Located about 450 km (280 miles) north of the regional capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Klyuchevskoy is one of the highest volcanoes in the world. It has erupted several times in recent years. Wednesday’s 8.8 magnitude quake off Kamchatka damaged buildings and injured several people in the remote Russian region, but no fatalities were reported. Here are some images coming to us over the wires: At Inage Beach in Chiba prefecture in Japan, officials have set up a security perimeter, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. One rescue worker told AFP the seaside area was off limits until further notice. The Klyuchevskoy volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia’s far east has started erupting after Wednesday’s powerful earthquake in the Pacific, Russian state news agency RIA reported, according to Reuters. The volcano is known to be the tallest active volcano in Eurasia. The massive quake struck on Wednesday morning in Russia, generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres (13ft) on the country’s east coast, damaging buildings and prompting evacuation warnings in the region and across most of Japan’s east coast, officials said. Shown below is an image of a previous eruption of the Klyuchevskoy volcano in October 2023, which led to schools in nearby towns closing as a result of the huge ash columns. Broadcaster Asahi TV reported a 58-year-old woman died when her car fell off a cliff while she was evacuating in central Japan’s Mie prefecture, Reuters reports. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said no injuries or damage had been reported, and there were no irregularities at any nuclear plants. But hundreds of thousands of commuters in Tokyo and surrounding areas faced being stranded as they headed home, with operations on railway lines along the Pacific coast remaining halted. Japan has lifted all tsunami warnings, downgrading them to a tsunami advisory, Reuters reports, citing the Japan Meteorological Agency. Authorities in Central and South America have ordered evacuations and issued tsunami warnings after the magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia’s eastern coast. In Colombia, the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said strong currents and tsunami waves were expected along the country’s Pacific coastline between Wednesday morning and lunchtime. The unit called for a precautionary evacuation of beaches and areas of low tide in the western departments of Nariño and Chocó. “Please get yourselves to high places away from the coast,” it asked on X. In Chile, the education ministry suspended classes at schools along parts of its Pacific coast while the National Disaster Prevention and Response Service issued a yellow alert for a possible tsunami. The service’s director, Alicia Cebrián, told reporters that the waves were first expected to hit Easter Island on Wednesday morning. “This information is dynamic and being permanently monitored,” Cebrián said, adding that evacuations would take place three hours before. In Panama, Omar Smith Gallardo, the head of the National Civil Protection System, called for calm and urged residents of the Pacific coast to stay away from the coast until lunchtime. Panama had not been affected by larger earthquakes in the past but it was not possible to guarantee “100%” that would be the case this time. Ecuador’s Oceanographic Institute of the Navy announced there was an “imminent danger” of a tsunami and said 1.4m waves were expected to hit the Galápagos Islands on Wednesday morning with larger waves potentially following. We have updates on some of Russia’s tsunami warnings from Reuters. Russia has lifted the tsunami warning for Sakhalin, according to local authorities Russia has lifted tsunami warning for Kamchatka, according to IFX. The tsunami alert has been cancelled in Russia’s Severo-Kurilsk, state-owned Tass news agency reports. The Kremlin has said alert systems “worked well” in the earthquake response and there were “no casualties”, Reuters reports. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said initial reports indicate no safety impact for nuclear power plants along the Pacific Coast, Reuters reports. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles said the Port San Luis gauge “shows a rapid and damaging surge, going from low to high tide in just a few minutes”. In a post on X it added: Do not return to inundated areas as waters will recede, but could return multiple times through the next 24 hours, and the first wave may not be the largest. Waves of up to 4 metres are expected to hit the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia in the early hours of Wednesday, AFP reports citing local authorities. Waves ranging from “1.10 metres to 4 metres” on the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas archipelago are expected overnight from around 1am local time (11.00 GMT), the High Commission of the French Republic in French Polynesia said in a statement, adding that the islands of Ua Huka and Hiva Oa are also expected to be affected. We have more from Japan’s weather agency. It has downgraded tsunami alerts issued for a wide swathe of the archipelago while keeping warnings unchanged for its northern areas, AFP reports. Warnings for eastern Japan’s Ibaraki region all the way down to the southern Wakayama region have now been downgraded to “advisories”, Japan’s weather agency said on its website. Here are some images coming to us over the wires: AFP is reporting that Japan has downgraded tsunami alerts for many areas, citing its weather office. There is no further tsunami threat to Guam, Rota, Tinian or Saipan, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said, Reuters is reporting. Tsunami waves of 3.6 ft (one metre) observed at Crescent City, California, Reuters reports, citing the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC). Local authorities in French Polynesia have issued a tsunami warning for the Marquesas Islands archipelago, with waves of 1.10 to 2.20 metres expected to hit the islands of Ua Huka, Nuku Hiva, and Hiva Oa overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, Reuters reports. Residents were urged to move to higher ground and follow official instructions, including securing boats or moving them away from the shore. Other archipelagos in French Polynesia may be affected by waves less than 30cm high, which do not require evacuation or sheltering, local authorities said. The Oahu Emergency Management Agency (EMA) said that the evacuation order had been lifted and it was safe to return to previously evacuated areas, Reuters reports. The EMA added that there was “no report of big damage”. Flights have restarted at Honolulu international airport in Hawaii, the Hawaii transportation department said, Reuters reports. The Hawaiian Emergency Management Agency (EMA) announced that commercial harbours will also reopen. Hawaii’s tsunami warning has been downgraded to an advisory with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) adding that “a major tsunami is not expected to strike the state of Hawaii”. The PTWC, operated by the National Weather Service, said in an alert: Based on all available data a major tsunami is not expected to strike the state of hawaii. However...sea level changes and strong currents may occur along all coasts that could be a hazard to swimmers and boaters as well as to persons near the shore at beaches and in harbors and marinas. Tsunami waves of 1.6 ft (0.5 metres) above tide level have been observed in Arena Cove in the US state of California, the US National Weather Service has said. It said that the tsunami warning remains in effect for the coastal areas of California from Cape Mendocino, California, to the Oregon/California border. It added: If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground. Tsunami warnings mean that a tsunami with significant inundation is possible or is already occurring. Tsunamis are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial arrival time. The first wave may not be the largest. Reuters has snapped the following: US embassy to Papua New Guinea: tsunami threat alert in Papua New Guinea, Solomon islands, and Vanuatu. by Jon Letman in Hawaii, Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam, Bryan Manabat in Saipan and Gavin Blair in Tokyo In the Pacific territory of Guam, just before lunchtime on Tuesday, Sam Mabini’s phone began to ping. A tsunami warning was issued after a powerful 8.8-magnitude quake struck a remote part of the Russian coast. Authorities put out the alert over concerns that destructive waves could slam the shoreline in the coming hours, urging people to move away from the coast. Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action. “I went to higher ground just in case,” Mabini said. Her family lives in the lower area of Tamuning and they moved to a more elevated part of the village. She joined other residents who evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of Guam’s capital, Hagåtña. In towns and cities across the Pacific, from Guam to Saipan and Hawaii, warnings and evacuation orders rang after the quake, one of the strongest ever recorded. Workers were sent home and businesses locked down as they braced for what might hit in the hours ahead. Read the full report here: Here are some images coming to us over the wires. New Zealand’s emergency management agency has issued a low-level threat warning for residents all around the nation’s coastline. The agency said it expected “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore” after the Russian earthquake. A warning said: “People in or near the sea in the following areas should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas and away from harbours, marinas, rivers and estuaries.” People on boats, live-aboards and in marinas should move onto the shore, the warning said, adding that people should not go to the coast to watch for any waves coming in. The Kahului Maui gauge in Hawaii recorded a tsunami amplitude of 4 ft (1.2 metres) relative to normal sea level, Reuters reports citing PTWC. Here is some more from the press conference from Hawaii governor Josh Green. “We have still not seen any wave activity come past the big island,” Green said. He added: “We expect it to be two to three hours at least until we can call all clear.” Green said not to get on the road “at all unless you need to”. Around 200 people were sheltering at Maui airport, he said. All flights in and out of the airport have been cancelled “for tonight”, he added. You can watch the press conference here: Hawaii governor Josh Green says airports have not yet been impacted by waves, Reuters reports. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (EMA) said all commercial harbours have been closed, Reuters reports. Hawaii governor Josh Green said all flights in and out of Maui have been cancelled, Reuters reports. He said there were no plans to shut off any power in advance, adding that so far they have not seen a wave of consequence. Tsunami waves near the Russian Pacific town of Severo-Kurilsk exceeded 3 metres (9.84 ft) in height. The most powerful wave reached up to 5 metres (16.4 ft), Reuters reports citing the news agency Ria. The Haleiwa gauge in Hawaii recorded a tsunami amplitude of 3ft relative to normal sea level, Reuters reports, citing PTWC. Tsunami waves are now impacting the state of Hawaii. Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said. If you are just tuning into this story, here is a quick explainer of what we know so far. More now from Russia, where the mayor of the country’s northern Kuril islands district said on Wednesday that “everyone” there had evacuated to safety following a tsunami that caused flooding and swept away buildings. “Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials. The initial effects of tsunami waves are expected to occur soon on Hawaii’s Kauai coast, with effects to Hawaii island about 20-30 minutes later. Hawaii governor Josh Green said data from Midway Atoll, which is part of the way between Japan and Hawaii, measured tsunami waves from peak to trough of 6 feet (1.8 meters). He said waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller and it was too early to tell how large they would be. A tsunami of that size would be akin to a three foot (90 centimeter) wave riding on top of surf, he said. He told a new conference that a wave that size could move cars and throw fences around. It can dislodge trees, that’s why you can’t just be out there. The impact is at great speed,” Green said. “Any any structure that gets loose and strikes the individual could take them out. And people can drown quite easily with the force of that kind of wave.” Meanwhile Shanghai is grappling with the twin threats of a tropical cyclone and a tsunami, with more than 280,000 people relocated from the city, and hundreds of flights and ferry services halted on Wednesday. Landfall of tropical cyclone Co-May in the port city of Zhoushan in Zhejiang province in the early hours of Wednesday was soon followed by warnings of a tsunami set off by a powerful earthquake off Russia’s far east, raising concerns of larger-than-expected storm surges along the Chinese coast. While the winds from Co-May were weaker than those generated by typhoons, the Chinese financial hub and other cities in the Yangtze River delta have taken no chances. Russia declares emergency on islands hit by tsunami Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands, where tsunami waves have damaged buildings and caused flooding, AFP reports. First tsunami wave expected to hit Hawaii at 7.17pm local time The first tsunami wave is expected to hit Hawaii in about half an hour. Gov. Josh Green said measurements showed a three-foot wave, above sea level, when the tsunami passed Midway Atoll, northwest of Hawaii. Green said in a briefing: This is a very serious event. … Please do not put yourself in harm’s way. A quick primer on tsunamis from the AP: What is a tsunami? Tsunamis are waves triggered by earthquakes, underwater volcanic eruptions and submarine landslides. After an underwater earthquake, the seafloor rises and drops, which lifts water up and down. The energy from this pushes sea water that transfers to waves. Many people think of tsunamis as one wave. But they are typically multiple waves that rush ashore like a fast-rising tide. What should I do if I get a tsunami alert? Authorities urge people to move to higher ground when they have indications a tsunami will arrive. Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside. How long does it take for tsunamis to arrive? It depends on how far the epicenter of the earthquake is from a coastal area. It could take just minutes for waves to hit land next to the site of a major quake. It could take hours for tsunamis to cross the Pacific Ocean. The speed of tsunami waves also depends on ocean depth. They travel faster over deep water and slow down in shallow water. How officials are responding across California tonight Officials across California warned residents on Tuesday evening to stay away from the coast, as the US west coast braced for waves caused by the earthquake in Russia. A tsunami warning, which warns of dangerous coastal flooding, is in effect for the state’s far northern coast. A tsunami advisory, which warns of strong currents and waves, is in place for the state’s southern coast. Waves are only expected to hit the California coast around midnight, but officials in this state that has seen its share of natural disasters pleaded with residents to take no risks. “Please stay alert and follow instructions from emergency personnel,” the California governor, Gavin Newsom, wrote. The LA mayor, Karen Bass, said emergency officials as well as police at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles were ready to respond. “Residents and workers in and around the L.A. Harbor area are urged to stay alert, avoid the waterline, and follow official instructions,” she said. Daniel Lurie, the San Francisco mayor, said the Bay Area should expect strong and dangerous currents that could impact beaches, harbours, docks and piers. “Make sure you and your family are prepared,” he added. Ecuador evacuates parts of Galápagos Islands, Peru issues tsunami warning The scale of the tsunami’s impacts keeps growing as countries on all side of the Pacific Ocean are taking precautionary measures. Peru issued a tsunami warning on Tuesday, according to the navy, saying officials will keep the situation “under constant surveillance”. And Ecuador ordered preventive evacuations of beaches, docks and low-lying areas in the Galápagos Islands off its coast late Tuesday, AFP reports. Mexico has also mobilised authorities at “all levels of government” to keep people away from Pacific beaches. Hawaii governor issues emergency proclamation Hawaii Gov. Josh Green has issued an emergency proclamation related to the tsunami and urged residents to heed evacuation warnings and not risk being near the shoreline. He said officials were monitoring the tsunami as it approaches the Midway Islands, which would give them a better sense as to how big waves could be when they reach the state in a few hours. Green said on X: People need to evacuate, that’s very clear. … Please take this very seriously. Do not risk being out at all near the shoreline. Green added in a news briefing that a tsunami wave was “not a regular wave”: It will actually kill you if you get hit by a tsunami, so you have to be out of that area. Tsunami expected to hit parts of eastern China, could cause damage China’s tsunami warning centre said Wednesday that waves of between 30cm and 1 metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard, AFP reports. The centre said: Based on the latest warning and analysis results, the Tsunami Advisory Center of the Ministry of National Resources has determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to cause damage to certain coastal areas of China. A warning from US weather officials: tsunamis are not just one wave The National Weather Service’s Bay Area branch issued a sharp warning against complacency surrounding a tsunami, warning against people trying to take photos of the event. The agency wrote on X: Friends please be aware, a Tsunami is a series of wave[s] carrying a large extra mass of water to our coast. This will NOT be a single wave. Do NOT try to go to the coast to take photos. You’re not just putting yourself at risk, you will also be putting rescue teams at risk. In case you’re overwhelmed by the sheer scope of updates across the Pacific, here’s a quick primer on what’s been going on today: Earthquake off Russia sets off tsunami warning sirens in Honolulu – video A tsunami warning has been issued for part of the California coastline. The warning stretches from Cape Mendocino up to the state’s border with Oregon. More than 900,000 under evacuation advisories in Japan Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said no injuries or damages have been reported so far, the AP reports. The agency has issued an evacuation advisory to more than 900,000 people in 133 municipalities along the Japanese coastline, stretching from Hokkaido to Okinawa. It’s unclear how many people actually took shelter. More from Jon Letman: Hawaii residents have become particularly sensitive to cell phone warning and civil defence sirens after Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency issued a false alert warning of an inbound “ballistic missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic. All islands have activated their Emergency Operating Centers, shelters are opening, and everyone in coastal areas is being advised to head to higher ground immediately. Kauai Police are asking the public to stay off the road unless absolutely necessary and advising of the closure of the westbound lane on Hanalei Bridge, with the eastbound land open for evacuations. Reporter Jon Letman is in from Kauai, Hawaii. He said tsunami warning sirens blared for a second time at 4:10 p.m (local time) and could be heard on multiple islands including Oahu and Kauai. Kyle Kajihiro, assistant professor at the University of Hawaii-Manoa, was on campus when he received a warning alert on his cell phone. Kajihiro said the campus was shutting down and traffic on Honolulu’s highways was noticeably heavy. On Kauai, shortly after the tsunami warning was issued, staff at the National Tropical Botanical Garden suspended tours on its south shore and moved all visitors and staff out of the inundation zone to higher ground. Blue skies and breezy conditions prevailed even as many Hawaii residents left work early heading for home or designated safe areas away from the islands’ heavily populated coastline. Russia appears to be the worst hit by the major earthquake so far, with some reported damage near the quake’s epicentre in Kamchatka. Footage showed a damaged kindergarten in the area, as well as waves sweeping inland in a port town nearby. There were also reports of waves up to four metres high in the remote region. But local officials have not yet reported any serious injuries. Oleg Melnikov, a regional health minister in Russia, said some people were hurt running outside and in other minor incidents, Reuters reports. But he said all patients “are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far”. Many along the Japanese coastline were waiting for waves to hit in the coming hour, and tsunami warnings remain in place for parts of Alaska and Hawaii. People gather on a rooftop after a tsunami alert in Japan – video Russian scientists call quake a ‘unique event’, warn aftershocks could last for up to a month In a statement posted on the Telegram channel for the local branch of the Geophysical Survey of the Russian Academy of Sciences’, the group called the earthquake a “unique event.” They said the epicentre was near a recent earthquake that struck the peninsula on 20 July, the AP reports. While the situation “was under control,” they said there are risks of aftershocks, which could last for up to a month, and warned against visiting certain coastal areas. Quake off Russia’s far east was region’s ‘strongest since 1952’, local agency says An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia’s far east coast early Wednesday was the region’s strongest since 1952, with aftershocks of up to 7.5 magnitude possible, the regional seismic monitoring service said, per Agency France-Presse. Kamchatka’s geophysical service said: The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected. Some scenes from Honolulu amid evacuation alerts for coastal areas: Earthquake now classified as magnitude 8.8, USGS says The USGS has updated its preliminary readings of the earthquake off the coast of Kamchatka this morning, and now classifies it as a magnitude 8.8. More than a dozen other, smaller quakes have since shaken the region. The 8.8 magnitude quake, if officially confirmed, would see the temblor in the top 10 largest earthquakes ever recorded. A post on X from Hawaii’s department of transportation notes that the coast guard has advised all vessels to leave port. That advisory is for all islands. The first waves in Hawaii were expected around 7pm local time, which is in about two and a half hours from now. Donald Trump has posted on Truth Social urging Americans to “stay strong and stay safe” following the tsunami warnings for Hawaii, Alaska and the Pacific coast of the US. “Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii. A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!” he wrote. Some images are coming through from Japan: Workers at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant in northeast Japan were evacuated Wednesday, according to AFP. “We have evacuated all workers and employees” at the Fukushima Daiichi plant – which went into meltdown after being hit by a tsunami in 2011 – a spokesperson for plant operator TEPCO told the news wire, adding that “no abnormality” had been observed at the site. A tsunami hit Russia’s far east coast on Wednesday, flooding a port town home to around 2,000 people, Russia’s emergencies ministry said. “The tsunami flooded parts of the port town of Severo-Kurilsk ... The population has been evacuated,” the ministry said in a statement. A video posted on Russian social media appeared to show buildings in the town submerged in sea water. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has added Australia to its advisory, saying waves of 0.3 to 1m are possible along the coast. However, the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre has not issued a warning for the country as of 11.25am AEST. Photo shows damaged kindergarten in Kamchatka, Russia The first waves from the tsunami have hit the coastline of Hokkaido in northern Japan. Broadcaster NHK reported the waves measured around 30cm. Officials in multiple countries have issued warnings that subsequent waves could be much higher. The National Tsunami Warning Center has issued a tsunami advisory for the entire West Coast of the US up into Canada and Alaska. The advisory stretches from California’s border with Mexico up through Oregon and Washington and into British Columbia in Canada before continuing to South Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula. This USGS map shows the spreading tsunami warnings, advisories, watches and threats as concern spreads across the Pacific. The first waves to hit Nemuro-Hanasaki Port in Hokkaido, Japan are estimated to have a height of 30cm, according to public broadcaster NHK. People in Kamaishi, Iwate Prefecture and Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, two of the cities that suffered the worst devastation from the 2011 tsunami, have evacuated to the same safe spots on higher ground used by survivors of that disaster, also per NHK. New Zealand warns of strong currents and surges after earthquake New Zealand can expect strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore, following an earthquake off the coast of Russia, New Zealand’s national emergency management agency (NEMA) has warned. NEMA said: Strong currents and surges can injure and drown people. There is a danger to swimmers, surfers, people fishing, and anyone in or near the water close to shore. People in or near the sea in the following areas should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas and away from harbours, marinas, rivers and estuaries. Most of the country’s coastline is under threat, NEMA said, however there was no need for anyone to evacuate unless directly advised by local civil defence authorities. The surges are expected to reach New Zealand around midnight local time. Tsunami sirens blaring in Honolulu Tsunami warning sirens are blaring in Honolulu, AP reports. People are being told to move to higher ground, or go to the 4th floor or above in a building at least 10 storeys high. Bryan Manabat, a reporter in Saipan, says residents are closely monitoring the tsunami watch announcement. Saipan is the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, with a population of around 43,000 people. Manabat says after the passing of a tropical storm recently, shorelines in Saipan have seen heavy soil erosion. He says some Saipan residents living near the shoreline in Beach Road, Garapan, plan to evacuate to higher ground now and just wait for an all clear notice from authorities. Authorities say the potential impacts of tsunami waves could be minor flooding of beach and harbour areas: strong and unusual ocean currents in bays and near other shore waters. Manabat says tsunami drills by emergency authorities have been held regularly in Saipan in recent years. A bit more detail from reporter Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam – residents have been told to “remain out of the water”. They have been told to move away from beaches and harbours, at least 100 feet inland and 50 feet above sea level. Ecuador is now among the countries that could be hit by tsunami waves from a huge earthquake off the coast of Russia, the US Tsunami Warning Center said Tuesday. Ecuador in South America and the east coast of Russia could be struck by waves of more than three meters (10 feet) triggered by the 8.7 magnitude earthquake, the center said. More strong quakes recorded off Russian coastline At least six earthquakes have now hit off the coast of Kamchatka today, the USGS says. They have all been strong with initial readings of magnitude 6.9, 6.3, 5.4, 5.7 and 5.6. But they do not compare to the massive, magnitude 8.7 temblor that set off a tsunami. To provide information to Japan’s growing foreign-born population, public broadcaster NHK is delivering updates in its television coverage in multiple languages: English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog (for Filipinos), accompanied by graphics, as well as in sign language. The broadcasts including warnings that even a tsunami of 50cm can be strong enough to sweep a person away. Hawaii officials order evacuation of coastal areas around Honolulu Officials in Hawaii have ordered an immediate evacuation of large parts of the coastline of Oahu, including coastal areas of Honolulu. A full map of the Oahu evacuation zones is here. Japan’s evacuation warnings span hundreds of kilometres, with official urging those near the coast to seek safety Yoshimasa Hayashi, chief cabinet secretary, said: Those near the coast should evacuate immediately to higher ground or safe buildings in the areas covered by the tsunami warning from Hokkaido to Wakayama Prefecture [hundreds of kilometres to the south]. Please be aware that after the initial wave, second and third waves of tsunamis can be even higher. A tsunami warning has been issued for the state of Hawaii. Officials say it could cause “damage along coastlines of all islands in the state”, warning “urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property”. The US Tsunami Warning System said: The danger can continue for many hours after the initial wave as subsequent waves arrive. Tsunami wave heights cannot be predicted and the first wave may not be the largest. The alert for Guam has now been updated to a tsunami advisory, per the USGS. A map of the region where the earthquake struck Reporter Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam said the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has put a “tsunami watch” in effect for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. The tsunami threat to Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from this earthquake is still being evaluated, it said. In a statement, the Center advised people to “stay alert” for further information and the tsunami watch could be cancelled or elevated to an advisory or warning. If a tsunami threat exists, the earliest estimated arrival time of tsunami waves within Guam, Rota, Tinian, or Saipan, would be 2:37 p.m. local time, it said. TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company), operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant that suffered a triple meltdown triggered by the 2011 tsunami, has announced that discharge of treated water contaminated by the disaster has been suspended until today’s tsunami warnings are lifted. Personnel engaged in the ongoing decommissioning work at the plant have also been temporarily evacuated. Japan has ordered immediate evacuations for parts of the country, saying tsunami waves are approaching the coasts, NHK reports. Tsunami warnings are in effect for a major stretch of Japan’s eastern Pacific coast, from Hokkaido’s eastern Pacific coast down to Wakayama Prefecture. Japan has upgraded to a tsunami warning following the quake. Russia says a tsunami with waves of 3 to 4 metres has hit parts of the Kamchatka region near the earthquake’s epicentre, Reuters reports. Per the latest alerts: Russia could see waves greater than 3 metres. Japan could see waves of 1 to 3 metres. Hawaii could see waves of 1 to 3 metres. Pacific islands including Midway Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra Island could see waves of 1 to 3 metres. Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Philippines could see waves of 0.3 to 1 metres. Earthquake was magnitude 8.7, USGS says The earthquake this morning has been upgraded to a magnitude 8.7, the USGS says. USGS confirms tsunami, issues warnings for parts of Alaska The USGS has confirmed a tsunami and issued an immediate tsunami warning for parts of Alaska. The warning is in effect for the Samalga Pass near the state’s Aleutian Islands. Japan warns people to stay away from shore along Pacific coast Authorities in Japan have issued warnings for people to stay away from the shore and not go into the sea for most of the Pacific coastline. Tsunami waves of up to 1 metre are being predicted to hit Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, at 10am local time, and then strike further south between 10.30am and 11.30am. Prime minister Ishiba was informed of the earthquake at 08.37am, and a government emergency committee was established shortly afterwards to collect information and coordinate responses. Japan has boosted its entire disaster detection, warning and response infrastructure in the wake of the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami. A kindergarten has been damaged as a result of the earthquake off Kamchatka, the regional governor has said, but so far no injuries have been reported. Vladimir Solodov urged people to move away from the coastline saying the earthquake was the “strongest in decades” in the area. A tsunami alert has been issued for Pacific islands, Russia and Japan after a magnitude 8 earthquake struck off Russia’s Kamchatka on Wednesday, the US Geological Survey says. The quake was shallow and strong enough to cause waves or a tsunami, it said. There was a tsunami threat to the Northern Mariana islands of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan, it said.
