  In May, Donald Trump took to the stage at a business conference in Saudi
  Arabia’s capital, promising that the US would no longer chastise other
  governments over human rights issues or lecture them on “how to live and how
  to govern your own affairs”. With the release this week of the US government’s
  annual report on human rights worldwide, the president has – in part –
  followed though on that pledge. The report – compiled by the state department
  – softens its criticism of nations that have sought closer ties with the US
  president, while alleging “significant” human rights breaches among
  traditional allies across Europe, all while vastly scaling back criticism of
  discrimination against minority groups. Hungary and El Salvador receive softer
  treatment The report’s claims of “no credible” human rights abuses in Hungary
  and El Salvador sit at odds with the state department’s own report from a year
  earlier, which described the situation in Hungary as “deteriorating”, while
  highlighting “arbitrary killings”, “enforced disappearance” and “torture” in
  El Salvador. In April, a delegation of EU lawmakers warned that the rule of
  law in Hungary is “rapidly going in the wrong direction” under Viktor Orbán’s
  government. They highlighted threats to press freedom and targeting of
  minorities. In June a law banning content about LGBTQ+ people from schools and
  TV was found to violate basic human rights and freedom of expression by a
  scholar at the European court of justice. Meanwhile, activists and opposition
  leaders in El Salvador have warned the country is on the path towards
  dictatorship after its congress scrapped presidential term limits, paving the
  way for President Nayib Bukele to seek indefinite re-election. Bukele’s
  hardline approach to crime has been accompanied by an assault on civil society
  and democratic institutions. Orbán and Bukele have both positioned themselves
  as Trump adherents – with El Salvador opening up a notorious mega-prison to
  detain US deportees. Orbán, who came to power in 2010, was once described as
  “Trump before Trump” by the US president’s former adviser Steve Bannon.
  European countries singled out France, Germany and the United Kingdom are
  among the European countries singled out as having seen a worsening human
  rights situation. The picture is a far cry from the previous report, which saw
  no significant changes. Criticism over the handling of free speech – in
  particular relating to regulations on online hate speech – was directed at the
  governments of the UK, Germany and France. The criticism comes despite the US
  itself moving aggressively to deny or strip visas of foreign nationals over
  their statements and social media postings, especially student activists who
  have criticised Israel. Since being returning to power, Trump and his
  administration have stepped up criticism of traditional allies – in February
  the vice-president, JD Vance, accused European leaders of suppressing free
  speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters’
  true beliefs. The report also singles out Brazil, where Trump has decried the
  prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil, the report says, has
  “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed
  to ‘undermine democracy.’” Israel-Gaza war The report’s section on Israel and
  the Palestinian territories is much shorter than last year’s edition and
  contains no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza.
  It acknowledges cases of arbitrary arrests and killings by Israel but says
  authorities took “credible steps” to identify those responsible. More than
  61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry says, as a
  result of Israel’s military assault after an attack by Palestinian militant
  group Hamas in October 2023 in which 1,200 people were killed. Notable
  omissions Sections within the report highlighting discrimination have been
  vastly pared back. Any criticism focused on LGBTQI rights, gender-based
  violence or racial and ethnic violence which appeared in Biden administration
  editions of the report, appear to have been largely removed. A group of former
  state department officials called some omissions “shocking,” particularly
  highlighting the lack of detail on Uganda, which in 2023 saw the passing of
  some of the harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws in the world, including the death
  penalty for some homosexual acts. The backlash For decades, the report has
  been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy – but critics
  have labelled this year’s edition politically driven. “The report demonstrates
  what happens when political agendas take priority over the facts,” says Josh
  Paul, a former state department official, adding “the outcome is a
  much-abbreviated product that is more reflective of a Soviet propaganda.” In
  April, secretary of state Marco Rubio wrote an opinion piece saying the bureau
  that prepares the report had become a platform for “left-wing activists,” and
  vowed that the Trump administration would reorient it to focus on “western
  values”. State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the report was
  restructured to improve readability and was no longer an expansive list of
  “politically biased demands and assertions”. Democratic party lawmakers,
  however, have accused Trump and Rubio of treating human rights only as a
  “cudgel” against adversaries, in a statement released this week. Rubio’s state
  department has “shamelessly turned a once-credible tool of US foreign policy
  mandated by Congress into yet another instrument to advance Maga political
  grievances and culture war obsessions,” said Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat
  on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. With Reuters
