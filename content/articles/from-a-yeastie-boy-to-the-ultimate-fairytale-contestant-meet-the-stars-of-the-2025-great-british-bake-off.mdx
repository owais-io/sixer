  The Great British Bake Off is upon us once more, shipping a new fleet of
  enthusiastic bakers into the big tent for another round of slightly too
  ambitious bakes. In time, these bakers will become like a second family to
  their audience. But for now, it’s fair to say, we have no clue who any of them
  are. So, in time-honoured tradition, here’s my predicted ranking of the 2025
  Great British Bake Off intake. The usual qualifications apply: I am basing
  this solely on the imageless press release that Channel 4 sent out, plus in
  all the years I have been doing this I have never once been right about
  anything. You’re welcome! 12. Toby, 29, Warwickshire Toby works for a fitness
  startup, and uses his contestant biography to reveal that he is three years
  into a home renovation project that was scheduled to last just six months.
  This leads me to believe that he initially applied to appear on Grand Designs,
  and is only on Bake Off due to a catastrophic clerical error. 11. Lesley, 59,
  Kent It has to be said that Lesley sounds absolutely lovely in her biography.
  However, she is a hairdresser who insists on giving a slice of cake to all her
  customers. So now I am fixated on what a terrible hairy cakey biohazard her
  floor must be, which is why I have ranked her so poorly. 10. Nadia, 41,
  Liverpool I’ve been doing this for long enough to know a red flag when I see
  one, and Nadia is absolutely buried in them. Exhibit A: she is described as a
  “chatterbox”, which is code for “annoying”. Exhibit B: there are repeated
  mentions of her performing dance breaks, which is code for “attention
  seeking”. Exhibit C: like Lesley, she is a hairdresser, which is code for “I,
  Stuart, am bald and need to take out my insecurities on someone.” 9. Iain, 29,
  Belfast The big concern with a show such as Bake Off is that it has been
  around for so long that it tends to attract people so desperate for fame that
  their personas have solidified into rigid caricatures. Enter Iain, a
  powerlifting influencer who refers to himself as the Yeastie Boy. However, let
  me remind you that at the time of writing, I don’t know what any of the
  contestants look like. If it turns out that Iain is big enough to beat me up,
  please ignore everything I just said and put him in the top three. 8. Aaron,
  38, London Lots to worry about here. Aaron, who moved to London from
  Manchester four years ago, uses his contestant bio to make two controversial
  statements. One is to call himself The King of Hobbies, which makes him sound
  like a dilettante who never sticks with anything long enough to reach a point
  of basic competency. The second is that he refers to hotdogs as a snack, which
  genuinely beggars belief. 7. Leighton, 59, Surrey Leighton is a Welshman who
  lives in Surrey with his California husband and has a mathematical mind, which
  tends to be an advantage on a show like this. However, Leighton’s bio also
  reveals that he specialises in a fusion style of baking that doesn’t sound
  particularly delicious. One of his favourite dishes, for instance, is a
  victoria sponge with key lime pie filling. Honestly. 6. Tom, 31, London Tom is
  a “creative entrepreneur”, which means that he founded an advertising agency
  then left it. The worrying part of his bio, though, is the bit where he cites
  Nadiya Hussain as an inspiration, because she has dealt with a level of fame
  that he thinks he will soon experience. I’m worried that getting eliminated
  from a cooking show one week before the quarter-final is going to turn the
  poor man into an absolute monster. 5. Jasmine, 23, London Jasmine is a
  Scottish medical student. This would be the most interesting thing about her,
  except she is clearly so competitive that she used her bio to blow Aaron out
  of the water. Forget hotdogs; Jasmine thinks that “a big bowl of pasta”
  qualifies as a snack. Wild. 4. Jessika, 32, London A few of the bios hint at
  someone’s showstopper going dramatically wrong in the upcoming season. My
  money is on the culprit being Jessika. A Cornish drag king, Jessika mentions
  that one of her showstoppers was “wildly heavy” and that she had to cover it
  in tempered chocolate in a panic. 3. Hassan, 30, South Yorkshire I’ve got a
  very good feeling about Hassan. This is purely because he is an analytical
  research and development scientist by trade, so is statistically much less
  likely to get into a tizzy and dump a litre of milk into a bread dough or
  whatever. However, let me temper this enthusiasm by pointing out that, in his
  bio, he states that he’d like to make a book-shaped cake one day. You have to
  worry about a man whose flight of fancy involves baking something in the shape
  of a rectangle. 2. Pui Man, 51, Essex Pui Man was born in Hong Kong and spends
  her free time distributing surplus supermarket food around her Essex
  community. As well as sounding extremely nice, she is also ambitious, stating
  that she wants to be the first Bake Off contestant ever to receive a hug from
  Paul Hollywood. Hopefully she can back up this ostentatious aspiration or,
  like Icarus before her, she will plummet back to Earth unhugged. 1. Nataliia,
  32, East Yorkshire Nataliia sounds like one of those fairytale Bake Off
  contestants who represent the very best of the country. A Ukrainian, she moved
  here a year before the war began, and her family followed as refugees. She has
  the potential to demonstrate that British people are more welcoming than
  headlines would have you believe. She also says that a cheese straw is an
  acceptable snack, which if nothing else clearly puts her head and shoulders
  above the pasta woman from earlier. The Great British Bake Off is back on 2
  September at 8pm on Channel 4
