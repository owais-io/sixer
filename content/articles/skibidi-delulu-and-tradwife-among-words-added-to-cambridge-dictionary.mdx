  “Skibidi”, “tradwife” and “delulu” are among the new words to have made this
  year’s Cambridge Dictionary in a selection that confirms the increasing
  influence of the TikTok generation on the English language. For those hoping
  that such neologisms would be a passing internet craze, the compilers of the
  dictionary say they are here to stay. “Internet culture is changing the
  English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the
  dictionary,” said its lexical programme manager, Colin McIntosh. “It’s not
  every day you get to see words like ‘skibidi’ and ‘delulu’ make their way into
  the Cambridge Dictionary. We only add words where we think they’ll have
  staying power.” Older generations and those not on TikTok will have just to
  get used to words such as skibidi. Children often use it to add emphasis to
  statements. It became popular thanks to Skibidi Toilet – a viral animated
  video that began on YouTube featuring human heads protruding from lavatories.
  The Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as “a word that can have different
  meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a
  joke’, an example of its use is: ‘What the skibidi are you doing?’” People
  older than generation Alpha tend to greet the use of the word with despair .
  The US writer and artist Lee Escobedo wrote in the Guardian earlier this year:
  “Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in irony but starved for
  meaning. This kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an
  ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their minds normalise
  prank-as-expression.” The tradwife phenomenon, which dates to a least 2020,
  has also been widely criticised. It refers to socially conservative
  influencers who celebrate looking after their husbands, children and homes and
  post about it on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The dictionary definition says
  a tradwife is “especially one who posts on social media”. Delulu, an
  abbreviation of delusional, is less controversial, but has become associated
  with a post-truth world where personal beliefs are more important than
  reality. Its dictionary entry defines it as “believing things that are not
  real or true, usually because you choose to”. Delulu emerged more than 10
  years ago as an insult directed at obsessive K-pop followers fans to question
  their belief that they would date their idols. The term “delulu is the solulu”
  for manifesting your wishes has been viewed billions of times on TikTok. The
  phrase “delulu with no solulu” was used earlier this year by Australia’s prime
  minister, Anthony Albanese, to attack his opponents in parliament.
  “Broligarchy”, a term for the tech industry leaders on whose platforms many of
  these new words are spreading, also makes it into the dictionary. Merging
  “bro” and “oligarchy”, the dictionary says it refers to “a small group of men,
  especially men owning or involved in a technology business, who are extremely
  rich and powerful, and who have or want political influence”. Other new
  entries in the dictionary include “mouse jiggler”, a post-pandemic device or
  piece of software used to make it seem as though you are working when you are
  not. “Work spouse”, meanwhile, is a phrase for workplace relationships where
  two people help and trust each other, according to the dictionary.
