  Babies trapped in space, zombie football stars and cat soap operas: welcome to
  YouTube in the era of AI video. Nearly one in 10 of the fastest growing
  YouTube channels globally are showing AI-generated content only, as
  breakthroughs in the technology spur a flood of artificial content. Guardian
  analysis of data from the analytics firm Playboard shows that out of the top
  100 fastest growing channels in July this year, nine were showing purely
  AI-generated content. The offerings include channels featuring bizarre
  narratives such as a baby crawling into a pre-launch space rocket, an undead
  Cristiano Ronaldo and melodramas featuring humanised cats. AI video generation
  has surged amid the release of powerful tools such as Google’s Veo 3 and Elon
  Musk’s Grok Imagine. The channels have millions of subscribers in total,
  including 1.6 million for the space-stranded infant and 3.9 million for Super
  Cat League, which features human-like cats having affairs and, among one of
  many bizarre scenes, the felines shooting down and dismembering an eagle. Many
  of these videos qualify as “AI slop”, which refers to low-quality,
  mass-produced content that is surreal, uncanny or simply grotesque. But some
  contain a brief, rudimentary plot – in a sign of the growing sophistication of
  AI-generated content. YouTube has tried to stem the slop deluge by blocking
  the sharing of advertising revenue with channels that post repetitive and
  “inauthentic” content – a policy targeted at AI content. “All content uploaded
  to YouTube is subject to our community guidelines – regardless of how it’s
  generated,” said a spokesperson for YouTube, which is owned by Google’s parent
  company. After being contacted by the Guardian about the channels – which
  included channels in the fastest growing list for June – YouTube said it had
  removed three of them from the platform and blocked a further two from
  receiving advertising income. It did not specify which channels had been
  sanctioned. One expert said AI video generators herald the next wave of
  internet “enshittification”, a term first used by the British-Canadian author
  Cory Doctorow. Coined in 2022, Doctorow used it to describe the decline in
  quality of users’ online experiences, as platforms prioritise profit over
  offering high-quality content. “AI slop is flooding the internet with content
  that essentially is garbage,” said Dr Akhil Bhardwaj, an associate professor
  at the University of Bath’s school of management. “This enshittification is
  ruining online communities on Pinterest, competing for revenue with artists on
  Spotify and flooding YouTube with poor quality content.” “One way for social
  media companies to regulate AI slop is to ensure that it cannot be monetised,
  thus stripping away the incentive for generating it.” Ryan Broderick, the
  author of the popular Garbage Day newsletter on internet culture, is scathing
  about the impact of AI video, writing last week that YouTube has become a
  “dumping ground for disturbing, soulless AI shorts”. Instagram’s Reels video
  feature is also flooded with AI content. On the platform, a video of various
  celebrities’ heads attached to animal bodies has gained 3.7m views, starring
  the “Rophant” (Dwayne Johnson and an elephant) and “Emilla” (Eminem on a
  gorilla). On TikTok, many AI-generated videos have gone viral, including a
  video of Abraham Lincoln vlogging his ill-fated trip to the opera and cats
  competing in an Olympic diving event. However, the Lincoln and cat Olympic
  videos are more in the spirit of the internet’s pre-slop era of playful wit.
  Instagram and TikTok said they require all realistic AI-content to be
  labelled. Videos suspected to contain AI from these channels were
  cross-checked with deepfake detection service provider Reality Defender. The
  channels featuring AI videos for July are: Super Cat League (3.9 million
  subscribers) বজল মিয়া 767k (2 million subscribers – this account has since
  been closed) LSB POWER GAMING (1.7 million subscribers) Amite Now Here (1.4
  million subscribers) Starway (2.8 million subscribers) AmyyRoblox (2.4 million
  subscribers) Again Raz Vai (1.8 million subscribers) Cuentos Facinantes (4.8
  million subscribers) MIRANHAINSANO (4.9 million subscribers)
