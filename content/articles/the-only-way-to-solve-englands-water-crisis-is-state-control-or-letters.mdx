  The behaviour of private water companies is widely recognised as unacceptable:
  they flout regulations, cause significant environmental harm, neglect their
  responsibilities, and still pay enormous sums to directors and shareholders.
  Ofwat’s rulings and fines appear ineffective, often penalising consumers
  (Letters, 18 August), while renationalisation is dismissed as prohibitively
  expensive. We propose an alternative means of controlling private-sector
  companies – replace Ofwat’s monetary fines with state-owned voting shares of
  equivalent value. This approach would have several immediate benefits. By
  exercising shareholder rights, the state – on behalf of the public – could
  directly influence company policies; the public purse would gain revenue from
  dividends; and over time, as the state’s shareholding increased, full
  nationalisation would become financially feasible. Dr Ruth Sinclair and Dr
  Jill Vincent Loughborough, Leicestershire • Your article says that not a
  single reservoir has been built since water privatisation (How can England
  possibly be running out of water?, 17 August). But close to 100 were built in
  the 35 years prior to privatisation. The plundering of our public services and
  natural resources is a national disgrace. Public ownership is the only way to
  end this grisly affair. John Lockwood Carshalton, London • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
