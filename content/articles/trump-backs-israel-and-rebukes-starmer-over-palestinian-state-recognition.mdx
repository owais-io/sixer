  Donald Trump has doubled down on his backing for Israel after having appeared
  to give a green light to the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, to
  recognize a Palestinian state. Amid signs of mounting opposition among his
  Maga base to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, Trump criticized Starmer’s
  plan to grant recognition as “rewarding Hamas” even after having not taken
  issue with it when the pair met in Scotland this week. Talking to journalists
  onboard Air Force One on his return to Washington, Trump said the US was “not
  in that camp”, referring to Starmer’s pledge, which followed a similar
  declaration by Emmanuel Macron, the French president, days earlier that France
  would formally recognize Palestinian statehood. “We never did discuss it,”
  Trump said, in reference to Starmer’s announcement. He added: “You’re
  rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded.” His
  comments were in line with the US state department, whose spokesperson, Tammy
  Bruce, called the recognition decision “a slap in the face” to victims of
  Hamas’s deadly 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the current
  war. But they contrasted with his restrained stance when he and Starmer met at
  Turnberry in Scotland on Monday, after the UK prime minister said Britain
  would give recognition by September unless Israel met certain conditions,
  including allowing for a ceasefire in Gaza and allowing UN food aid to enter
  the territory to feed its population. “I’m not going to take a position, I
  don’t mind him taking a position,” Trump told reporters when asked if he
  objected to Starmer’s move. The US president’s response to Starmer seemed
  markedly softer than his riposte after Macron’s statehood announcement last
  week, which angered Israel and its supporters. “What he says doesn’t matter,”
  Trump told reporters at the White House. “He’s a very good guy. I like him,
  but that statement doesn’t carry weight.” The initial softer public posture
  toward Starmer came as Trump publicly contradicted Benjamin Netanyahu, the
  Israeli prime minister, over conditions in Gaza, which numerous international
  aid agencies have described as famine. Netanyahu had said that, in contrast to
  the aid group assessments and searing images of hungry children, no one was
  starving in Gaza. Asked if he agreed, Trump said: “Based on television, I
  would say ‘not particularly’, because those children look pretty hungry to me.
  There’s real starvation, you can’t fake that.” Some of Trump’s most prominent
  supporters have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of Israel’s
  conduct, amid polling evidence that Americans generally are losing sympathy
  for a country that has traditionally been viewed as one of the US’s closest
  allies. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser and still one of his leading
  cheerleaders with his War Room podcast, told Politico that the president’s
  condemnation of the food situation in Gaza would hasten Israel’s loss of
  support among his base. “It seems that for the under-30-year-old Maga base,
  Israel has almost no support, and Netanyahu’s attempt to save himself
  politically by dragging America in deeper to another Middle East war has
  turned off a large swath of older Maga diehards,” Bannon said. “Now President
  Trump’s public repudiation of one of the central tenets of [Netanyahu’s] Gaza
  strategy – ‘starving’ Palestinians – will only hasten a collapse of support.”
  Another Trump supporter, the far-right Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor
  Greene, became the latest – and perhaps most surprising – public figure to
  label Israel’s actions in Gaza “genocide”. “It’s the most truthful and easiest
  thing to say that Oct 7th in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be
  returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation
  happening in Gaza,” she posted on X. The comments came as a new Gallup poll
  showed support among Americans for Israel’s actions in Gaza down to 32%, the
  lowest since the organization began asking the question in November 2023 – a
  month after the murderous Hamas raid that killed almost 1,200 mostly Israeli
  civilians and led to another 250 to be taken hostage. Israel’s military
  response has led to about 60,000 Palestinians being killed, according to the
  Gaza health ministry. While Gallup’s poll showed support for Israel’s
  offensive still high, at 71%, among Republicans, Thom Tillis, a GOP senator
  for North Carolina who plans to step down at the next election, said Gaza
  could be a political problem for Trump, the Hill reported. “I think that the
  American people at the end of the day are a kind people. They don’t like
  seeing suffering, nor do I think the president does,” Tillis said. “If you see
  starvation, you try to fix it.” Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel,
  told Fox News that Trump’s backing for Netanyahu remained unshaken. “Let me
  assure you that there is no break between the prime minister of Israel and the
  president,” he told Fox News. “Their relationship, I think, [is] stronger than
  it’s ever been, and I think the relationship between the US and Israel is as
  strong as it’s ever been.” Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to visit
  Israel on Thursday, where he will meet with officials “to discuss next steps
  in addressing the situation in Gaza”, a US official told AFP.
