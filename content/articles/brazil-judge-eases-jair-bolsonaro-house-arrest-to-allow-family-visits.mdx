  A Brazilian supreme court judge has eased the terms of Jair Bolsonaro’s house
  arrest, allowing the far-right former president to receive visits from family
  members without prior judicial approval. The former paratrooper turned
  populist has been under house arrest since Monday, when Justice Alexandre de
  Moraes ordered the measure on the grounds that Bolsonaro had allegedly
  violated court orders. In his initial ruling, Moraes permitted Bolsonaro to
  receive only his lawyers and the family members he lives with at a mansion in
  Brasília: his wife, Michelle, his daughter and his stepdaughter. All other
  relatives were required to seek judicial authorisation, a restriction that has
  now been lifted. “I authorise visits from the detainee’s sons,
  daughters-in-law, granddaughters and grandsons without prior notice,” Moraes
  wrote, stressing that all visitors must still comply with the ban on using
  mobile phones or taking photos and videos of the former president. Bolsonaro
  also remains barred from contacting his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman
  who has been in the United States since March and claims to have played a key
  role in persuading Donald Trump to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports –
  a move the US president justified as a response to what he called a
  “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro. Two weeks ago, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to
  wear an electronic ankle tag to prevent a potential escape attempt. In
  justifying last Monday’s house arrest, the justice argued that Bolsonaro had
  flouted a court order prohibiting the use of social media – including by third
  parties – by appearing via video call at Sunday rallies, a recording of which
  was later posted by one of his politician sons, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro.
  Although legal experts broadly agree that the case accusing Bolsonaro of
  leading a coup attempt in 2022 is strong, the house arrest order has sparked a
  more contentious debate. Some have defended the judge’s decision, arguing he
  had been “patient” with Bolsonaro’s repeated breaches of court rulings. But
  other legal scholars argue that it is unclear what precise violation Bolsonaro
  committed, noting that he was not explicitly banned from speaking at public
  events. In response to Moraes’s latest ruling, politicians aligned with
  Bolsonaro have blocked congressional proceedings, demanding that lawmakers
  vote to impeach the supreme court justice and grant amnesty to the hundreds
  accused of involvement in the alleged coup attempt – including the ransacking
  of Brasília on 8 January 2023. The case against the 70-year-old politician is
  at an advanced stage and a verdict is expected as early as next month, with
  Bolsonaro facing a potential sentence of more than 40 years in prison.
