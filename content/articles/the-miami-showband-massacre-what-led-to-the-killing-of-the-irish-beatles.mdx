  ‘It was absolutely despicable,” says Des Lee, his voice trembling with
  emotion, “to think that those people who were supposed to be protecting us had
  planned our murder …” I’ve never heard a story as astonishing as Lee’s. His
  memoir, My Saxophone Saved My Life, recounts the events of half a century ago,
  in which his much-loved pop group, the Miami Showband, were ambushed by
  loyalist paramilitaries operating a fake army checkpoint, with half his
  bandmates murdered as he lay still, playing dead to stay alive. Though the
  attack carries strangely little traction in Britain, the Miami Showband
  massacre of 1975 is deeply etched into Irish cultural memory. Even amid the
  context of the Troubles, whose bleak statistics – more than 3,600 dead, more
  than 47,500 injured – made slaughter almost normalised, the killing of three
  members of the Miami Showband left Ireland in shock. Fifty years after the
  atrocity, Lee, 79, tells me about a tangled plot with its roots in the
  uniquely Irish phenomenon of showbands. In their heyday in the 1950s to 70s,
  showbands – besuited troupes, closer to cabaret than rock’n’roll, performing
  contemporary hits with slick routines choreographed down to the last
  synchronised leg kick – fulfilled a need for glamour and escapism at a time
  when overseas stars seldom visited Ireland. Showbands, who typically took the
  stage around midnight, provided a crucial context in which young people from
  the Catholic and Protestant communities could forget their troubles (and the
  Troubles), and let their hair down. “As far as we were concerned,” Lee
  recalls, “a punter was a punter, no matter what religion, creed or colour.
  They would mingle, and you could have a Protestant meeting a Catholic and
  getting married. It was incredible.” Born John Desmond McAlea on 29 July 1946,
  Lee grew up in the Catholic suburb of Andersonstown, West Belfast, in a
  relatively comfortable working-class family. He would supplement his pocket
  money in audacious ways. On 12 July, AKA The Twelfth or Orangemen’s Day, the
  Protestant community would hold rallies at which the likes of Reverend Ian
  Paisley would vehemently denounce Republicans and Catholics. Lee would go
  along and blend with the crowd, collecting bottles discarded by the Loyalist
  throng and claiming the penny deposits. Lee found a job at a plumbing supplier
  but his head was soon turned by rock’n’roll, and he quit to follow in the
  footsteps of his nightclub musician father. He served his apprenticeship on a
  thriving Belfast scene centred around Cymbals instrument shop, where he rubbed
  shoulders with a teenage Van Morrison (“A strange guy,” says Lee, “but an
  exceptional talent”) and future members of Thin Lizzy. In 1967, the circuit’s
  leading act, the Miami Showband, underwent one of its periodic reshuffles and
  drafted in Lee on sax, along with a handsome, charismatic singer-pianist
  called Fran O’Toole. Fronted by Dickie Rock, who had represented Ireland at
  Eurovision, the Miami were as big as it got. When Des calls them “The Irish
  Beatles” with a twinkle, it’s only slight hyperbole: they topped the Irish
  singles chart seven times. “When I got the deal to join,” says Lee, “I
  thought, ‘My God, all my birthdays are coming together.’ I jumped at it.”
  “Girls were screaming,” he says. “We would have 2,500 people inside watching
  us, and 2,500 outside trying to get in. I couldn’t go to the shop without
  people wanting my autograph. It was stardom with a capital S.” Lee developed a
  close friendship and songwriting partnership with O’Toole, who later replaced
  Rock as frontman. Lee became the bandleader. His responsibilities included
  repertoire and finances, and ensuring everyone looked immaculate (70s footage
  shows them in dazzling-white suits with glittering lapels). He also instilled
  discipline. “My job was to make sure everybody was squeaky clean,” he says.
  “No going on the piss before a gig. We weren’t saints or angels, make no
  mistake. What goes on afterwards, behind closed doors, nobody knows. But we
  had to put on a professional show.” The Miami Showband entered the summer of
  1975 in an optimistic mood. The band had scored major hits with Charlie Rich’s
  country standard There Won’t Be Anymore and Bonnie St Claire’s bubblegum-glam
  nugget Clap Your Hands and Stamp Your Feet. O’Toole was being groomed for solo
  stardom, and had been booked to play Las Vegas to launch his Lee-penned single
  Love Is, with the intention of positioning him as the next David Cassidy. But
  that show never took place. On Wednesday 30 July 1975, the Miami played the
  Castle Ballroom in Banbridge, County Down, about 10 miles north of the border.
  “It was just a normal night, nothing untoward. We came off stage and did the
  usual thing: signed autographs, chatted to the fans, then we had a cup of tea
  and a sandwich, and got ready to do the journey back to Dublin.” Road manager
  Brian Maguire went ahead in the equipment van. Drummer Ray Millar drove
  separately to visit family in Antrim. The rest of the band – O’Toole, Lee,
  Brian McCoy, bassist Stephen Travers and guitarist Tony Geraghty – climbed
  into the Volkswagen minibus and headed south. Eight miles into the journey, at
  2.30am on Thursday 31 July, they were flagged down by the red torch of an army
  checkpoint, a commonplace occurrence in the North. “You would be asked the
  same questions: ‘Where are you going, where are you coming from?’” says Lee.
  “We would be sitting in the van with a bottle of brandy or whiskey, and we’d
  occasionally offer a drop to the soldier who stopped us.” They were asked to
  step out of the van – again, not entirely unusual – and made to line up facing
  the roadside ditch. At first, the soldiers chatted casually, but their
  demeanour changed when someone with an English accent joined them and began
  giving orders. McCoy found this reassuring, telling Travers that they were
  dealing with the regular British army rather than the less predictable,
  locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). Before the search, Lee asked
  permission to fetch his saxophone to show it wasn’t a weapon, laying it on the
  road a few feet away. Suddenly, an almighty explosion tore through the van,
  throwing all five musicians across the ditch into the undergrowth. The
  soldiers had not been soldiers at all – at least, not on duty. The fake army
  patrol were members of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), although
  at least four of them were also serving with the UDR. Their intention was to
  plant a briefcase bomb under the driver’s seat, timed to explode further down
  the road. The timer malfunctioned, instantly killing two members of the UVF’s
  Mid-Ulster Brigade, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville. In the chaos, an order
  was given to shoot the fleeing musicians to eliminate witnesses. Lee lay still
  with his face in the grass, slowing his breathing and pretending to be dead –
  a trick he had learned from watching Vietnam movies – as he heard the murder
  of his friends taking place around him. First to die was McCoy, 32, shot in
  the back with a Luger pistol. Travers, 24, hit by a dumdum bullet, was
  seriously wounded. As Geraghty, 24, and O’Toole, 28, attempted to drag him to
  safety, they were caught by gunmen, pleading for their lives before being
  executed with Sterling submachine guns. O’Toole was shot 22 times, his
  long-haired head so badly mutilated that a doctor would later ask Lee if there
  was a girl in the band. Travers lay next to the body of McCoy and, like Lee,
  played dead. Once the attackers had apparently left the scene, Lee cautiously
  went to fetch help. “The main road was the most horrific scene I’ve ever seen
  in my life,” he remembers. “There were bits of bodies lying all over the
  place. It was horrendous.” The first passing vehicle, a truck, refused to give
  Lee a lift. Eventually, a young couple agreed to drive him to nearby Newry,
  where he alerted police. “My hand was on the door handle just in case, ready
  to jump out, because I didn’t trust anybody at that stage.” The killings
  stunned Ireland, and thousands lined the streets for the funerals of the
  murdered musicians. The Miami Showband had represented hope. Not only did
  their shows unite communities, but their membership was mixed: McCoy and
  Millar were Protestants, the rest were Catholics. Is it fanciful to suggest
  that they were targeted because someone, somewhere, resented this
  pan-sectarian fraternisation? Lee doesn’t think that was the motive. “We were
  the No 1 band, and this gang wanted maximum publicity. If that bomb had
  exploded when they intended, the Miami Showband would have been accused of
  carrying weapons for the IRA.” (Indeed, within 12 hours, the UVF accused the
  band of being bomb-traffickers, describing their killing as “justifiable
  homicide”.) Lee agreed to testify at the trial in Belfast on condition he was
  helicoptered to and from the Irish border, with 24-hour protection. His life
  was threatened by relatives of the accused; he has, he says, been looking over
  his shoulder ever since. Lance corporal Thomas Crozier and Sgt James McDowell,
  both of the UDR, were sentenced to life in the Maze prison, as was John
  Somerville, brother of the deceased Wesley and a former soldier. (They were
  released under the Good Friday agreement.) Everything pointed towards
  collusion: covert collaboration between paramilitaries and the organs of the
  British state. Travers, Lee and Millar relaunched the Miami Showband with new
  members before the year was out, to familiar scenes of hysteria – but their
  hearts weren’t in it. Travers felt they had become a circus, and that
  audiences had come to stare rather than dance; he left the band the following
  year. For Lee, now lead singer, it could never be the same without his lost
  band members. “I looked around and there was no Fran, no Brian and no Tony,
  and I didn’t enjoy that.” In 1982, tired of feeling that he and his family
  were in danger, Lee started a new life in South Africa, performing as a
  saxophonist and band leader on the Holiday Inn circuit. He remained there for
  two decades, only returning after his wife, Brenda, died. Travers, meanwhile,
  went on a tenacious, meticulous search for the truth, engaging with numerous
  investigations and initiatives. A 2019 Netflix documentary, Remastered: The
  Miami Showband Massacre, is centred around his dogged efforts. Through the
  years, the finger of suspicion has repeatedly pointed at two men: Capt Robert
  Nairac of the Grenadier guards (later executed by Republicans), and Robin “The
  Jackal” Jackson, a former soldier from County Down and a key figure in the
  notorious Glenanne Gang, were believed to have planned the ambush. Both were
  named by British intelligence whistleblowers, and Ken Livingstone named Nairac
  as a conspirator in his maiden speech as an MP. In December 2017, 80 documents
  were released including a 1987 letter from the UVF to the then-taoiseach
  Charles Haughey on headed notepaper, which openly admitted collusion with MI5
  in the attack. The evidence was now overwhelming. The historic activities of
  the Glenanne Gang, including the Miami Showband Massacre, fall under the
  purview of Operation Denton, due to report this year. The massacre hasn’t
  faded from Irish memory. A sculpture commemorating the dead musicians,
  unveiled in 2007 by former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, stands on Parnell Square in
  Dublin. One person who apparently didn’t remember, however, was Bono, who
  described the 2015 shootings at the Eagles of Death Metal show in Paris as
  “the first direct attack on music”. He later apologised, and U2 incorporated a
  slide of the Miami Showband into their show. The survivors don’t have the
  luxury of forgetting. The trauma has left an indelible mark. Travers was
  diagnosed, in later life, with enduring personality change. Lee has, he tells
  me, experienced profound survivor’s guilt. In 2021, Lee was awarded £325,000
  compensation, in a package he says was presented to survivors and families as
  a take-it-or-leave-it deal. He considers the sum to be “peanuts, for 50 years
  of anger and pain”. More than financial recompense, he says what he hopes for,
  with up to five perpetrators still officially unaccounted for, is closure:
