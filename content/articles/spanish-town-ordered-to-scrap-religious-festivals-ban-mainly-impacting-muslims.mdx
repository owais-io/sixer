  Spain’s central government has ordered officials in a Spanish town to scrap a
  ban on religious gatherings in public sports centres, describing it as a
  “discriminatory” measure that breaches the right to religious freedom as it
  will mainly impact Muslims. “There can be no half-measures when it comes to
  intolerance,” Ángel Víctor Torres, the minister for territorial policy, wrote
  on social media on Monday. Rightwing opposition parties, he added, “cannot
  decide who has freedom of worship and who does not”. Last week, it emerged
  that the conservative-led council in Jumilla, a town of about 27,000 residents
  in the region of Murcia, had backed the ban. As its Muslim residents had for
  years used the facilities to come together to mark Eid al-Fitr and Eid
  al-Adha, the motion was widely seen as targeting the town’s estimated 1,500
  Muslims. The proposal was initially put forward by the far-right Vox party,
  which called for an outright ban on public celebrations such as Eid al-Adha.
  Vox’s hardline motion was watered down and subsequently backed by the People’s
  party (PP), which removed the explicit reference to Eid al-Adha and instead
  stipulated that municipal sports facilities could no longer be used for
  “cultural, social or religious activities foreign to the city council”. Vox
  had demanded the measure in exchange for backing the budget put forward by the
  town’s PP mayor. As the far right celebrated what it described as the “first
  measure” to ban Islamic festivals in Spain’s public spaces, the outcry was
  swift. The head of a prominent Muslim association in Spain described the ban
  as “institutionalised Islamophobia”, while the country’s migration minister
  called it “shameful”. In Jumilla, the PP defended the motion, arguing that it
  did not single out any religion or belief and highlighted that 72
  nationalities coexisted in the town without any issue. The local mayor, Seve
  González, told El País the council was aiming to “promote cultural campaigns”
  that defended “our identity” and protected the “values and religious
  expressions of our country”. In Madrid, the Socialist-led central government
  seized on the measure, portraying the PP as beholden to the far right, forcing
  the party to compromise with Vox while also drifting further to the right in
  order to compete for votes. Spain’s migration minister, Elma Saiz, said those
  who paid the price would be citizens who had spent decades peacefully living
  in Jumilla and had helped to sustain a local economy centred on vineyards and
  crops such as olives and almonds. She told the broadcaster Antena 3:
  “Foreigners make up 20% of those who contribute to social security in Jumilla.
  These towns would collapse without them.” Saiz brushed off the claim that the
  ban was aimed at protecting Spanish identity, citing the country’s history as
  a Muslim stronghold. “To me, that seems utterly ignorant,” she said. “It
  overlooks that we would not be the country we are today if we could not
  appreciate the contribution of Muslim culture to our language, our works of
  art, advances in architecture and civil engineering.” Among the chorus of
  voices condemning the ban was the Catholic church, which described it as a
  form of discrimination that was incompatible with the right to religious
  freedom, while the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain told news agency
  Europa Press that the measure was a “serious democratic setback”. The leader
  of Vox, Santiago Abascal, said he was “perplexed” by the stance of the
  Catholic church. Speaking to a far-right YouTube channel, he suggested the
  church’s view could be linked to its reliance on public funding or to clergy
  abuse scandals that he claimed have “absolutely muzzled” it. On Monday, a
  central government representative said the council in Jumilla had a month to
  formally respond to Madrid’s request. If it failed to respond, the central
  government would explore what other legal options are available, the
  spokesperson added. The measure came weeks after unrest gripped Torre-Pacheco,
  about 60 miles (100km) from Jumilla, with baton-wielding groups taking to the
  streets to “hunt” people with foreign origins after an assault on an older
  person. In the lead-up to the unrest, after the pensioner told local media he
  believed his attacker had been of north African origin, racist messaging on
  social media rocketed by 1,500%, according to tracking by the central
  government. The events in Jumilla and Torre-Pacheco hinted at how the far
  right had started down a path that put all of Spain in danger, said Mounir
  Benjelloun Andaloussi Azhari, the president of the Spanish Federation of
  Islamic Religious Entities. “The goal of all this – let’s not forget – is so
  that the far right can win votes,” he told the news site Eldiario.es. “And if
  they need to criminalise an entire population to do so, if they have to
  generate hatred, if they have to lie and make coexistence impossible, if they
  have to say this is an ‘invasion’ they will do it.” He had lived in Spain for
  30 years, but said it was the first time he – along with many others – had
  felt persecuted: “All for a handful of votes. At the expense of citizens’
  fear, at the expense of Spain’s image around the world, and at the expense of
  betraying those who once proposed a stable model for Spain that guaranteed a
  series of rights that they now want to do away with.”
