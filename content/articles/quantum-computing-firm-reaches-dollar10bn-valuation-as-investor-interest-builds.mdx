  A British quantum computing entrepreneur has doubled the value of his stake in
  the business he founded to $2bn (£1.5bn), after the company achieved a $10bn
  valuation in its latest fundraising. Ilyas Khan, 63, is the founder of
  Quantinuum, a UK-US firm that announced on Thursday it had raised $600m as
  investor interest builds in the cutting-edge technology. Khan set up
  Quantinuum’s predecessor company, Cambridge Quantum, in 2014 before it merged
  with the US-based Honeywell Quantum Solutions in 2021. Khan, a former owner of
  his home town’s football club Accrington Stanley, is now chief product officer
  at the business and to date has not sold any shares since founding it more
  than a decade ago. He owns a stake of about 20%, with the US conglomerate
  Honeywell controlling 54%. New investors in the funding round include the chip
  maker Nvidia and US venture capital firm QED. Excitement over the potential
  for quantum computing, and the companies at the forefront of its development,
  has been building amid a series of technological breakthroughs, with the UK
  government setting a target of 2035 to develop quantum systems capable of
  outperforming conventional supercomputers. Quantum computing has the potential
  to power breakthroughs in a wide range of areas, from drug discovery to
  artificial intelligence, owing to its ability to carry out far bigger
  calculations than conventional computer systems. However, experts have said it
  has the ability to crack high-level encryption, which has prompted calls for
  governments and companies to adopt quantum-proof cryptography. However, the
  technology still needs to develop, and become more stable, before it can
  achieve transformative breakthroughs. Classical computers encode their
  information in bits – represented as a 0 or a 1 – that are transmitted as an
  electrical pulse. A text message, email or even a Netflix film streamed on a
  smartphone is a string of these bits. In quantum computers, however, the
  information is contained in a quantum bit, or qubit. These qubits, encased in
  a modestly sized chip, are particles such as electrons or photons that can be
  in several states at the same time, a property of quantum physics known as
  superposition. This means qubits can encode various combinations of 1s and 0s
  at the same time – and compute their way through vast numbers of different
  outcomes. However, they have to be kept in a highly controlled environment,
  such as being kept free from electromagnetic interference, or else they can be
  easily disrupted. Rajeeb Hazra, Quantinuum’s chief executive, said its new
  funding would “strengthen the entire quantum ecosystem”. Quantinuum produces a
  full range of quantum technologies, from hardware to the algorithms and
  software that power its systems. Its customers include government institutions
  and, in the private sector, companies such as the banking groups JP Morgan and
  HSBC. With HSBC, it helps banks solve particularly challenging problems in
  areas such as fraud detection and cybersecurity. It also helps simulate new
  materials and molecular structures for pharmaceutical companies The UK’s
  science minister, Lord Vallance, said the $10bn valuation was “a vote of
  confidence in quantum’s transformative potential, and the speed of progress in
  putting quantum to work, here in the UK”.
