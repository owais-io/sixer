  The newly elected deputy leader of the Green party and his family were
  attacked on a day out at the seaside last week, with bottles thrown and racist
  abuse hurled, he has told the Guardian. Mothin Ali, a Leeds councillor, said
  the incident was a reflection of extreme rightwingers using inflammatory
  language to blame immigrants and refugees for social problems. Ali, who was
  born in Sheffield and has lived in Yorkshire all his life, was on the beach at
  Cromer, Norfolk, with his mother, wife and children when a group appeared. “It
  was a lovely sunny day. I’d been building sandcastles and catching shrimps in
  rock pools with my six-year-old. Suddenly there were these people throwing
  beer bottles at us, and shouting: ‘Get out of our country’ and ‘Paki
  bastards’. Then one of them decided to pull his trousers down.” Ali recounted
  the incident as an example of how Reform UK and other rightwing activists have
  increasingly ramped up anti-minority rhetoric in recent months. “Reform UK
  offers simple ‘solutions’ to extremely complex problems – blame immigrants,
  blame black and brown people, blame Muslims,” he said. “The language is
  incredibly inflammatory. It’s language that is designed to stir up hate.” Ali
  said that Reform UK was a “big threat” to cohesion, but the Green party under
  new leadership was in a strong position to offer a radical alternative. On
  Tuesday, the party announced that members had overwhelmingly elected Zack
  Polanski as leader and Ali as joint deputy leader with Rachel Millward, the
  co-leader of Wealdon district council in Sussex. The party was now led by a
  “gay Jewish man, a straight practising Muslim with a big beard and from a
  northern working-class background, and a middle-class woman who’s a feminist,”
  said Ali. “Between us, we can reach across country, class, race, religion and
  geography. It sends a message that Britain’s a melting pot of all kinds of
  people. We just created a microcosm of the macro.” He added that the Green
  party was “full of very decent, thoroughly nice people, but sometimes that can
  be a little bit of a problem. If you’re too agreeable or too nice, people can
  easily ignore you. I’ve always felt we’ve got to be a lot more assertive in
  our messaging and a lot stronger in communicating our policies and values.
  “Now we have a leadership team of three people with different styles,
  different reaches to different communities, all coming together and uniting as
  one. A wide approach with a unified message.” The key message was one of hope,
  he said. “I represent one of the most deprived communities in Leeds. This
  morning I got a call from a lady with young children who’s paying full rent on
  a house that is almost uninhabitable. There are people struggling to buy food
  for their children. Even people in well-paid jobs are having to tighten up.
  “But we live in one of the richest countries in the world. No one should be
  struggling to eat. These are political choices.” Politicians need to come up
  with creative solutions, he said. “For example, we could create solar farms on
  people’s rooftops right across the country. That would help with high energy
  bills and the climate crisis.” Since being elected as a councillor in Leeds
  last May, Ali has been outspoken on the war in Gaza. On the day of his
  election, speaking against the backdrop of a Palestinian flag, he said “this
  is a win for the people of Gaza” and “Allahu Akbar”. After a backlash, he
  apologised “for any upset my comments caused about the Gaza conflict” but said
  criticism of his use of the words “Allahu Akbar” suggested Islamophobia.
  Earlier, on the day Hamas launched its attack on Israel in October 2023, Ali
  said on social media that Palestinians had the right to “fight back”.
  Polanski, who has said he is proud to be Jewish but is “certainly not a
  Zionist”, told a march for Palestine in June that he stood with others “who
  refuse to look away from the horror and injustice unfolding before our eyes”.
  The Green party leadership’s stance on Gaza may attract voters who are
  dismayed at Labour’s position. But, said Ali, the Greens were not “trying to
  win votes, but believe what we’re saying”. “There is a genocide taking place,”
  he said. “We won’t know the extent of it for years, but what we see is
  horrible enough. The Labour party has been pathetic, but also they’ve been
  complicit. The UK is not just a passive observer [of the war]; we’re active
  participants.” Ali said he expected the Greens to win “lots more” seats in
  parliament at the next election, but that he would not necessarily be among
  its MPs. “If there’s a need, then I’ll stand for it. If there’s someone better
  than me, I’ll happily step aside and sit in my garden.” Despite the
  challenges, he said: “I haven’t felt this positive about politics ever. I
  think we can be a really powerful voice.”
