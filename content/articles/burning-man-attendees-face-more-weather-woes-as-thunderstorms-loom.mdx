  Visitors arriving in Nevada’s desert for this year’s Burning Man festival have
  so far encountered heavy winds and dust storms, and could be in for
  thunderstorms as well, with the harsh conditions possibly persisting for
  several days. The famous gathering began Sunday in the Black Rock Desert,
  roughly 100 miles (160km) north of Reno. Strong winds and dust storms
  disrupted the event over the weekend, temporarily pausing activities, tearing
  through tents and reducing visibility to nearly nothing. It was confirmed that
  at least one major art installation was destroyed in the storm: an 8-ton
  inflatable thundercloud known as “Black Cloud” reportedly held together for 15
  minutes before being ripped apart by winds. The piece, created by a
  Ukrainian-led team, was meant to symbolize the “specter of world war”. By
  Monday, organizers confirmed that both the festival gates and the Black Rock
  City airport had reopened, allowing the event to resume as scheduled. “There
  are some of the structures that are blown over,” Austin Matthew, an art
  creator at Burning Man, told Fox Weather. “Things had broken. And even just
  driving to our camp spot, there were all camps that were pretty much wiped
  out. Things were just laying on their side, completely annihilated at that
  point.” Matthew had arrived on Sunday after the wind damage on Saturday. He
  also described experiencing delays due to closed gates and rain affecting
  entry. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that a powerful dust storm struck
  the desert on Saturday evening, damaging camps, delaying travel and leaving at
  least four people with minor injuries. On Monday night, a social media account
  that monitors travel conditions to the festival grounds posted that “clouds
  continue to form around Black Rock City, and these will probably lead to
  another weather event this evening … It may or may not hit us, but we should
  prepare as if it will.” The post added: “This weather will affect driving on
  playa and gate wait times. Please tell your campmates and neighbors so we can
  all be prepared.” Additional thunderstorms have a high probability of hitting
  Black Rock City between Tuesday and Wednesday, according to AccuWeather. The
  National Weather Service also warned of a “monsoonal moisture” that could
  spark “minor flooding” through Nevada until Thursday. Organizers estimate that
  about 80,000 people attend Burning Man annually. Despite the dust storms,
  harsh winds, thunderstorms and numerous delays, more than 40,000 people were
  in attendance by Monday morning, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. Clips
  on social media posted over the weekend showed participants struggling against
  wind gusts, with the thick dust obscuring camera views. The weather system
  could bring scattered hail and more dust, but rainfall and added moisture
  might also ease conditions. Drier weather is expected to arrive Thursday,
  providing some relief until the event concludes next Monday. Last year,
  downpours turned the desert roads to mud, creating gridlock that stretched
  into a seven-hour drive over the 5-mile (8km) exit route. Despite the summer
  festivities, such weather is considered typical of the Black Rock Desert
  during monsoon season. Meanwhile, the Burning Man Project website launched a
  livestream of the festival on Tuesday following some technical delays caused
  by the dust storms and lightning.
