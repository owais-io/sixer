  Coco Gauff has reportedly split with coach Matthew Daly just days before the
  start of the US Open, making another shakeup to her support team on the eve of
  the year’s final major. The move was first reported by Bounces. The world No 3
  and two-time major champion will continue to work with her longtime coach
  Jean-Christophe Faurel but has added biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan
  to her corner. MacMillan was spotted with Gauff during a Wednesday practice
  session at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. MacMillan
  previously worked with Aryna Sabalenka, helping the world No 1 overcome her
  serving yips in 2022 and refine her forehand. Gauff has struggled with her own
  serve this summer, notably hitting 42 double faults in three matches at the
  Canadian Open earlier this month. Daly, a grip specialist, confirmed his
  departure after a little more than a year in the role. He joined Gauff’s team
  last autumn after she parted ways with Brad Gilbert, focusing on altering her
  grip and adjusting technical details. The changes initially paid off: Gauff
  captured the China Open title and closed 2024 by winning the WTA Finals. This
  season she added a second major at the French Open and reached the finals at
  both Madrid and Rome. But inconsistency has returned in recent months. Since
  her Paris triumph she has won just four singles matches, including a surprise
  first-round exit at Wimbledon. Daly, speaking to Bounces, said only: “Only
  have good things to say about Coco, enjoyed working with her.” Gauff, 21, has
  yet to publicly comment on the staff changes. She is due to play in a Thursday
  night exhibition at Arthur Ashe Stadium before the US Open singles begins on
  Sunday.
