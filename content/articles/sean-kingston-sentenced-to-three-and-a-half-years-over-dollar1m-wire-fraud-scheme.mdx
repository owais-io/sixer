  Sean Kingston has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a
  Florida court for a $1m wire fraud scheme, according to NBC South Florida. The
  35-year-old singer, born Kisean Anderson, was found guilty in a South Florida
  court in March alongside his mother, Janice Turner, for accruing about $1m
  worth of luxury items through falsified payments that never cleared. Turner
  was sentenced in July to five years in prison with three years of probation.
  The two were initially arrested in May 2024 on theft charges after a Swat raid
  on Kingston’s South Florida mansion. Investigators told the court that
  Kingston used social media from April 2023 to March 2024 to arrange purchases
  of luxury items, and invited sellers to his Florida homes with the promise to
  feature them and their merchandise on his accounts. When it came time to pay
  for the items, such as a bulletproof Cadillac Escalade or an Audemars Piguet
  watch, Kingston or his mother texted the sellers fake wire receipts. During
  her trial, Turner admitted to falsifying wires for her son, which she claimed
  was an effort to protect him from scammers by delaying payments for luxury
  items. Kingston refused to testify. As evidence, the prosecution presented
  texts from Kingston to his mother that read “I told you to make [a] fake
  receipt” followed by “so it [looks] like the transfer will be there in a
  couple [of] days”. Before the judge delivered his sentence, Kingston
  apologized and said he had learned from his actions, according to the
  Associated Press. His lawyer had previously asked the judge for home
  confinement, due to the non-violent nature of the crime and the fact that
  Kingston had paid back most of the people he defrauded. Born in Miami and
  raised in his parents’ native Kingston, Jamaica, the singer remains most
  famous for his 2007 single Beautiful Girls, which topped the Billboard charts.
  He has released four albums and collaborated with the likes of Nicki Minaj and
  Chris Brown. In 2011, he scored a modest hit with Justin Bieber on the track
  Eenie Meenie. According to federal court records, Turner pleaded guilty in
  2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000, and served nearly 18 months in
  prison. Turner and Kingston have been sued multiple times for failure to pay
  for luxury items, most recently by a Florida entertainment systems company in
  February 2024.
