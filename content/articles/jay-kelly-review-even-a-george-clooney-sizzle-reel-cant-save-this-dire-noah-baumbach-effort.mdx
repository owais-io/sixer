  Jay Kelly review – even a George Clooney sizzle reel can’t save this dire Noah
  Baumbach effort

  Everybody loves George Clooney, and rightly so. His performances in films such
  as Michael Clayton, Out of Sight and Ocean’s Eleven have been a joy, and as an
  elegant public figure he has more or less single-handedly underwritten the
  continuing currency of Hollywood classiness. But in this dire, sentimental and
  self-indulgent film, he has the look of a man who has found strychnine in his
  Nespresso pod and can’t remember which of the cupboards in his luxury hotel
  suite contains the antidote. It is directed by Noah Baumbach, whose 2022 film
  White Noise, based on the Don DeLillo novel, was a superb competition entry at
  Venice. (Baumbach was reportedly disconcerted by a tepid response; I thought
  it was brilliant.) But this one is a grisly, sucrose, sub-Fellini swoon on the
  subject of a super-handsome Hollywood actor attending a Italian arts festival
  to accept a lifetime achievement award, and naturally experiencing endless
  bittersweet flashbacks to his youth, in which the middle aged Jay Kelly looks
  on, with that knowing Clooney smile. The reason for attending this festival is
  so that Kelly can bump into his teenage daughter who is backpacking around
  Europe. He even takes the humble train so he can hang out with her, and
  thereby encounters an uproarious array of picturesque and ordinary people,
  including a hyperactive German cyclist played by Lars Eidinger. And at this
  moment of midlife self-examination, Kelly feels that he has let everyone in
  his life down (although bafflingly the mother of his grownup children has gone
  missing from the story). He is estranged in serious and non-serious ways from
  his daughters (played by Riley Keough and Grace Edwards), he is preparing to
  betray his longsuffering agent Ron (Adam Sandler), he has refused to help his
  directorial mentor (Jim Broadbent) and he is plagued with memories of how at
  the beginning of his career he ruthlessly stole a key part from his more
  talented drama school pal (Billy Crudup), whose career went downhill
  afterwards. And he can’t decide who he is, or if there is any one behind the
  celebrity mask. So Baumbach’s film pirouettes into territory already trodden
  by Fellini’s 81/2 and Woody Allen’s Stardust Memories, but smothers everything
  in a bland, Tuscan sunshine-syrup. The sharp realisations about the cruelty of
  show business are cancelled by gushes of Hollywood self-adoration and
  self-forgiveness and jokey non-comedy. Finally, Kelly watches a sizzle-reel of
  his roles at the festival ceremony, and of course these are clips of Clooney’s
  actual films (no ER though). It is an unbearable imposition on the audience’s
  affections, but there is a tear in Jay’s eye. Cine-narcissism like this is
  always tiresome, and it isn’t any more palatable in a European setting. • Jay
  Kelly screened at the Venice film festival. It is in cinemas from 14 November
  and on Netflix from 5 December.
