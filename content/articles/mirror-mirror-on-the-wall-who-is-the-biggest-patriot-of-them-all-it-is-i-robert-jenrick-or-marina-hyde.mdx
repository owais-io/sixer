  I wake up early – earlier than Nigel Farage. Not drinking as much as him
  helps. But look, no shade. As I keep telling interviewers, I admire Nigel’s
  longevity. He can keep going for ever, can’t he, aged whatever-he-is and with
  that lifestyle, which makes his biological age only a couple of months more
  than Joe Biden’s was last summer. I’m a huge fan. Then it’s a pacy run round
  the constituency, or one of the nicer bits of London or Herefordshire if I’m
  at one of my other houses. If I spot a lamp-post that hasn’t been flagged, I
  make a mental note to go mental at the team. By next week I want to be
  photographed St Georgeing anything over 10 foot: wind turbines, 5G masts, the
  giraffes at London Zoo. Then we stick it on the socials. Run me up the
  flagpole and see who salutes me. Breakfast is typically a full English yoghurt
  and whichever type of coffee doesn’t constitute taking the wrong side in the
  culture war. I previously took Ozempic but I didn’t inhale. What people see
  now is the result of me, personally, taking a stand. I had the discipline to
  control my northern border – my mouth – rather than letting it be a soft touch
  for marauding doughnuts or foreign pastries who should quite reasonably have
  sought refuge somewhere safe but weak, like within France or James Cleverly.
  As I survey myself in the mirror, I’m incredibly proud of the fact that I went
  so much further than one-in, one-out. Far more crap now leaves my gob than
  goes into it. That’s down to the same iron will I would bring to the
  leadership of the Conservative party. Not that there’s a vacancy; Kemi’s doing
  a great job. Certainly a job. A part-time job, some would say. I’m sure she’s
  exhausted herself quite enough for one week with her Sunday Times interview.
  Of course, they asked her about everyone saying I was soon to be leader of the
  Tory party, and she said: “I think even Rob himself finds it distressing.”
  Bless her. But what she needs to remember is that I’m much, much stronger than
  that. Then it’s straight into the Range Rover and off to work, unless I’m
  doing a video in a tube station. I’m getting incredible feedback for my videos
  from people who would previously have given me a wedgie. Having said that,
  last week I saw the most problematic thing I’ve seen on a phone since Richard
  Desmond showed me his property development idea at a Conservative fundraiser
  and I personally greenlit it. This time, though, it’s on my phone, and it’s a
  video posted by Chris Philp where he says he got threatened with a knife at
  the migrant camp in Calais. I immediately texted Chris: “Who do you think you
  are – Mr Beast?” Got the cryface emoji back so had to press it. “Seriously
  mate, who do you think you are???” Reaching the office, I discover another big
  shipment of flags has arrived from Temu. I ignored last week’s message from
  the Department for Business that I am personally increasing the trade deficit
  with China: patriotism is bigger than all that stuff. I may not buy British
  but I certainly fly British. One of the team has left out a print-out of the
  recent ConservativeHome popularity ranking, which I topped. That’s a nice
  touch – if you want to work with me, you need to be committed to the project.
  I like to joke that it’s the law, and I know because I used to be justice
  secretary. Well, secretary to the justice secretary, but yeah. Same
  difference. The morning is spent publicly complaining about things we either
  didn’t fix or made worse when in office, but I don’t see contradictions. Some
  might say I was one of the public faces of the campaign to lock people up
  during the pandemic. But they forget I actually twice freestyled the rules –
  so what did I really believe? Honestly, I’m embarrassed for people who keep
  bringing up past versions of Robert Jenrick. It’s like talking about Peter
  Parker before he was bitten by the radioactive spider, or the Hulk before he
  gets the gamma dose. Seriously, if Marvel did shadow ministers … Mid-morning,
  the team will sit with me for my telly time. Unfortunately, today we switched
  on and Farage was unveiling a plan for mass deportations. According to Nigel,
  who looked tired, he’s going to deport all immigrants who arrived here
  illegally. Hundreds of thousands of people, and if they don’t agree
  immediately then they’ll be imprisoned at military sites before being
  expelled. I’m stunned. That is genuinely horrible – for me. “Why didn’t any of
  you lot think of that?” I scream at the team. “How am I supposed to outflank
  him on immigration if he keeps advancing his army? He’s halfway across the
  Polish border by now!” There’s a short silence. “You could deport all
  immigrants,” says one. “Except your wife,” says another. “You could,” says a
  third, “think of a tougher and more eye-catching name for the internment
  camps.” “Like what?” I snap. But they all look at their shoes. That’s the
  trouble with this generation – no concentration. The afternoon is taken up
  with the standard work of a modern MP and public servant – running through
  tweet ideas and workshopping a banterious text to JD Vance. Then, I power the
  Range Rover home for dinner as a father of daughters. When Nigel’s tucking
  into the post-prandials, I’m tucking myself in. We all need a hinterland, as I
  tweet just before falling asleep. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist
