  Split it, sell it, or find a way of keeping it in the family? That’s the
  question three sisters asked themselves when they inherited a property, built
  by their parents in the 1970s, on a plot of land near Home beach on
  Minjerribah/North Stradbroke Island. The sisters had been holidaying at the
  house since they were children, and the site was “almost impossible to
  replicate”, says one sibling, who asked to remain anonymous. “We decided quite
  quickly we didn’t want to get rid of it,” she says. As the older building had
  been eaten by mycelium, the hard part was deciding what to do with it next.
  When the architect Daniel Burnett from Brisbane’s Blok Modular viewed the
  house to discuss the owners’ vision for three units, the sisters took him to
  the beach, where they all got in their bathers and “sat around in the water
  for about two hours”, he says. Along with sharing memories, they made one
  request: equitable access to the beach – “or we’re going to have fights”. “No
  matter how old you get, the sibling dynamic is still present,” he says. “They
  were quite unapologetic about that.” Forming a committee of sorts, the sisters
  (who are in their 60s) assessed every design decision as one. “It was a
  unified force,” says Burnett. The result is a trio of two-storey terraces
  identical by design, from the hardwood floors to the light fixtures. Each
  three-bedroom, two-bathroom unit was designed so the occupants would feel
  immersed in nature, says Burnett. “You can sit anywhere in that building –
  even though it’s a long skinny house – and feel like you’re on the beach,” he
  says. • Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the
  weekend, every Saturday morning “It’s magic,” says one sister. “Right now I’m
  looking out over the sea watching the whales go by.” Awareness of the natural
  environment extended to the home’s disaster-preparedness. Windows had to be
  triple glazed to fit fire zone safety requirements, for example, which the
  sisters say adds to the sense of privacy in each individual house. “Inside
  with the windows closed, you can’t hear anyone else,” says the sister. Blok
  Three Sisters was named house of the year in 2025’s Houses awards. It’s an
  example of “stealth density”, says the architect John Ellway, one of the
  jurors. “You can see how the ideas in this [project] could be replicated and
  rolled out in a lot of different places.” It could be used for “three
  families, three generations, or three friends. That’s what stood out for us,”
  Ellway says. Designing each unit the same way, down to the furnishings, was a
  practical choice. “The more you customise, the higher the price gets,” says
  the sister. To decide which sibling got which property, they “went out to
  dinner and drew lots”. They knew they wanted a prefabricated modular build
  because they’d seen how quick and efficient it could be. “Doing everything you
  can possibly do in a controlled environment reduces the disruption for
  delicate ecosystems,” like Stradbroke Island’s, says Burnett, who partnered
  with architect Stuart Vokes from Brisbane’s Vokes and Peters and builders
  Pagewood Projects to create modules that would be delivered and assembled on
  location. “You can be a bit more ambitious about what you’re building because
  you’re not hanging off a ladder in the afternoon sun, and you can utilise the
  cranes and sophisticated machinery that’s installed in the factory rather than
  available on the back of a ute,” he says. Local plumbers and electricians were
  employed to connect the building to services, and a small team was sent to
  complete cosmetic joins between the modules. But otherwise the homes are fully
  finished in the factory: “Every window, door, tile, joinery, tap, all the
  flooring.” Built to budget and with readily available materials, it shows “a
  good project doesn’t necessarily have to be this luxurious flashy thing”, says
  Ellway. “Given that it’s prefab and modular, the other thing [the jury]
  acknowledged is that if the need came to move it, they could lift it up and
  take it somewhere else,” or raise the properties a metre off the ground. “The
  modular build gave us timing certainty,” says the sister, as they first
  engaged with the architects shortly after Covid. The buildings were completed
  within a year. “I think this project is exciting because it demonstrates a
  model for housing density,” says Burnett. “It shows it’s possible to make
  multi-storey, multi-residential housing in a factory at a very high standard
  that could be applied to other models, like social housing,” he says. The
  architectural design “helps us maximise the magic”, says the sister. “Sitting
  on that double-height deck, looking toward the beach, laying on the couch
  reading a book, is really very beautiful.” At Christmas and Easter, all three
  siblings and their families come together on the big lawn on the beach side of
  the property. “When we live in it, we face the beach, that lawn,” she says.
  “That’s our face to the world.”
