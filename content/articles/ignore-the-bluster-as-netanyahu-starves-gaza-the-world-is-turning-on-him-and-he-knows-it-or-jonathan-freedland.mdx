  “No one likes us, we don’t care.” It may be rousing on the stadium terraces of
  south London, as the signature chant for Millwall football club, but as a
  national strategy it’s a disaster. Even so, Israel has become a Millwall among
  the nations, apparently unbothered by and impervious to the condemnation of a
  watching world – condemnation which this week gained serious momentum. As one
  country after another pointed an accusing finger towards Israel, repelled by
  the starvation, devastation and bloodshed it has brought down on Gaza, Israeli
  officials offered the now-familiar middle finger in return. When Keir Starmer
  announced Britain’s intention to recognise a state of Palestine, it was
  swiftly brushed aside by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem as “much ado about
  nothing”. There was a similarly dismissive reaction to both France’s earlier
  pledge to make the same diplomatic move and Canada’s announcement on Wednesday
  that it would follow suit. Sometimes, the register is studied insouciance, a
  shrug of the shoulders; sometimes it’s anger. But the message is consistent:
  we won’t budge. As the Israeli ambassador to Canada put it: “Israel will not
  bow to the distorted campaign of international pressure against it.” Yet for
  all the Shakespearean references, the “diplomatic tsunami” which Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s critics warned of for many years, and which now seems to have
  arrived, is not nothing. What’s more, and underneath the Millwall bluster,
  there are signs that Netanyahu knows it. More than 140 of the 193 member
  states of the UN had already recognised Palestine, but that club will soon
  include major western powers: the shift by France, the UK and Canada means no
  fewer than three members of the G7 are now on board. This same week saw a
  special conference convened at the UN in New York, where 125 countries urged
  Netanyahu to commit to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside
  Israel, as they sought to resurrect the long-moribund two-state solution. All
  this diplomatic activity has prompted a series of objections from Israel and
  its defenders. First comes the claim that Israel’s critics are appeasers.
  Witness Netanyahu’s tweeted riposte to Starmer, which included the line:
  “Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails.” Netanyahu often likes
  to invoke Winston Churchill and here he is again, casting himself as the
  Greatest Briton with Starmer as Neville Chamberlain, while his foreign
  minister is full of talk of Munich and 1938. As if there is any analogy
  between Nazi Germany grabbing a chunk of Czechoslovakia and Palestinians
  seeking self-determination in their historical homeland. It’s a line of
  argument insulting in its ignorance. Next comes the charge that the likes of
  Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney are “rewarding terror”, handing Hamas
  a prize for the murderous series of atrocities it staged on 7 October 2023.
  But that’s an odd way to read what just happened. This week’s New York
  declaration, which was signed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the Arab
  League, explicitly condemns “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians”
  on that day, the first such official denunciation by the Arab states.
  Moreover, the document is unambiguous that “Hamas must end its rule in Gaza
  and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority”. The same message
  comes through loud and clear in the declarations made by Starmer and his
  counterparts: it is the PA, currently led by Fatah, that they envisage as the
  recognised authority of a Palestinian state. The leaders can be faulted for
  failing to explain how this vision of theirs will be realised, but the vision
  itself is straightforward – and there is no place in it for Hamas. Hard to
  spin that as a “reward”. More forceful is the objection made by those
  campaigning for the release of the 20 Israeli hostages still believed to be
  held alive in Gaza. They argue that Starmer erred badly in suggesting that the
  UK would not go ahead with recognition of a Palestinian state if there were
  soon to be a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. That, the
  campaigners argue, in effect incentivised Hamas to refuse to do any deal –
  which would have to include the freeing of at least some hostages – so that UK
  recognition goes ahead as promised. Starmer’s defenders believe this line of
  argument rests on a misunderstanding of Hamas. That group is not interested,
  they say, in a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza, living alongside
  Israel. Hamas is not in the two-state business, but rather seeks to rule over
  a single, jihadist state across the entire land, from the river to the sea.
  Indeed, given that the international community supported the principle of
  Palestinian independence before 7 October, to abandon it afterwards would
  itself be to reward Hamas, allowing that group to derail the two-state
  solution which it has been determined to sabotage since it first sent suicide
  bombers on to Israeli buses more than 30 years ago. More powerful still is the
  charge that these announcements and declarations are displacement activity,
  gestures that reveal nothing so much as the various governments’ impotence.
  There is something to that: diplomatic recognition will not feed a single
  child in Gaza. When Starmer’s various demands on Netanyahu are blithely
  ignored, it will only advertise the British PM’s weakness. In a way, the move
  this week tacitly recognises that reality. It is predicated on the notion that
  Israel continues to act in ways that make a two-state solution less viable.
  Previously, Starmer had always said he wanted to wait until UK recognition
  could play a part in an unfolding, meaningful peace process. Now he has
  acknowledged that there is no such thing, that he risked holding on to a card
  that was turning to dust in his hands. Better to play it now before it becomes
  entirely worthless. As Wes Streeting put it, the UK should recognise Palestine
  “while there is still a state of Palestine to recognise”. The hope in London,
  Paris and elsewhere is that, when the Gaza war eventually ends, the parameters
  of what should follow will already have been staked out. But, of course,
  Netanyahu is not listening. He made the decision long ago that Israel can
  ignore everybody – that the EU and the UN, along with every global institution
  from the World Health Organization to the BBC, can all be written off as
  hopelessly biased, if not bigoted – with only one exception: the US. Over the
  past decade or more, he has gone further, writing off half of the US too,
  choosing to ignore all Democrats and focus only on the Republican party. So
  long as Israel has the GOP’s backing, it’ll be fine. That has always been a
  reckless strategy and this week confirmed the danger of it. For one thing,
  Israel needs the support of more than one country. The EU and UK may not match
  the US as arms suppliers, but, economically, Israel needs them as trading
  partners, on favourable terms. Besides, the US Republican party is not a
  wholly reliable ally: a substantial wing of the Maga movement is hostile to
  Israel. (This week, Marjorie Taylor Greene became the first US lawmaker to
  accuse the country of genocide.) And Trump himself does not entirely share
  Netanyahu’s sweeping disregard for international opinion. He disdains it, but
  he also seeks its approval: he wants that Nobel prize. Steadily, the Israeli
  public is coming to see the price of the pariah status that Netanyahu has all
  but cultivated. A small portent is contained in the trouble currently greeting
  Israeli tourists in Greece. That may be the best way to understand the
  vehemence with which Israeli officials sought to dismiss Starmer et al this
  week, insisting in loud, furious statements that they weren’t bothered at all.
  Increasing numbers of Israelis know they do not have the luxury of being
  Millwall: maybe no one likes them – but quite a lot of them care. Jonathan
