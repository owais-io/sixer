  Darren Aronofsky’s new film is a blast from the past; a half-cut retro tour of
  late-1990s New York. Beetling around the tatty East Village, casually framing
  the twin towers downtown, it lifts the lid on a time that has been and gone:
  when the city was a melting pot of miscreants and misfits, when lowly bar
  staff could still afford Gotham rents, and when every car came equipped with a
  cigarette lighter. “Don’t they have those any more?” says Aronofksy, frowning
  at his untouched cup of herbal tea. “I don’t know, maybe not. It’s been many
  years since I smoked a cigarette.” Caught Stealing, he says, could almost be
  his parallel-universe first movie, given that it’s set in 1998, around the
  time he was shooting his actual first film, Pi, on the same East Side streets.
  He was in his late 20s back then, subsisting on pizza and living in a
  fifth-floor walk-up. He was anxious and ambitious; he had his eyes on the
  prize. He now thinks he ought to have enjoyed himself more. He’s nostalgic,
  but so what? It doesn’t mean he’s not right. “The 90s were such a remarkable
  time, an exciting time to be alive. It was a lot more loose. There was a sense
  of innocence. The Soviet Union was gone. Climate change wasn’t on 99% of
  people’s minds and the big scandal was Bill Clinton having an extramarital
  affair. People were looking forward to the new millennium. It was going to be
  The Jetsons. It was going to be sci-fi.” The director grins and shakes his
  head. “We weren’t all living in a state of existential terror.” Aronofsky is
  now 56 and has spent the bulk of his career on the darker end of the street.
  His films are a rogues’ gallery of brawlers and bawlers, extending from the
  sweaty contortions of The Wrestler and Black Swan through to the anguished
  operatics of Requiem for a Dream and Mother. Super-heavy, he says,
  super-intense. Except that the world turned so black that he wanted to make
  something light, or at least lighter than his usual brand of Sturm und Drang.
  He’s like the film-maker hero from Sullivan’s Travels, Preston Sturges’s
  Depression-era classic, who belatedly learns the value of entertainment and
  escapism. “Absolutely,” he says. “Sullivan’s Travels – that’s a huge
  touchstone for me. But also Hitchcock’s thrillers, Martin Scorsese’s After
  Hours, and a movie like Frantic, with Harrison Ford. I like those films that
  feature an ordinary hero. The common man who finds himself out of his depth.”
  In the case of Caught Stealing, that man is Hank Thompson, a baseball whizz
  turned slacker bartender, nicely embodied by Austin Butler, star of 2022’s
  Elvis. Hank has a mysterious key to a safe full of loot and various criminal
  gangs on his tail. The cops are no help and may even be outright crooked. With
  its hurried setup complete, Caught Stealing proceeds to run wild alongside
  Manhattan’s riotous 90s fauna, through a neighbourhood of wholesalers and
  meat-lockers, back yards and dive bars. Matt Smith plays an expat London punk
  who has to open the sun-roof to accommodate his turmeric-coloured mohawk. Liev
  Schreiber and Vincent D’Onofrio crop up as orthodox Jewish brothers who lament
  the shabby state of the city even as they blow holes in it with their
  shotguns. The film is based on a 2004 novel by Charlie Huston, although
  Aronofsky says that it was effectively co-written by the city, the locations
  shaping and changing the action. Fast-paced and punchy, Caught Stealing is a
  welcome corrective to Aronofsky’s previous picture, The Whale. I’m worrying,
  though, that we may be slightly mis-selling its tone. The film is violent and
  bloody and borderline nihilistic. It only looks light compared to the other
  movies he’s made. “People are calling it a comedy,” he says. “IMDb is calling
  it a comedy. And I’m like, ‘Really?’ I mean, there’s definitely some laughs.
  There are probably more jokes in the first 10 minutes of this than in my
  entire body of work. But a comedy, I don’t know. It’s more a romp, a hoot, a
  caper. There’s a lot of the Lower East Side in the mix.” New York still has
  soul, he insists. At its heart, it’s the same city that he remembers from his
  youth. It’s the people who’ve changed; nowadays, everyone’s on their phone.
  That’s the other key reason why he made Caught Stealing: he wanted to create
  something that was fun enough to lure people back to the cinema. “That’s the
  mission these days. We’re in a war with meme culture. With TikTok and
  Instagram stories. People’s attention is no longer on storytelling. But
  storytelling is so valuable for humanity.” He frowns again at his cup of tea.
  Its presence seems to irk him. “Here’s the litmus test,” he says. “Every
  person who reads this article will have a memory of a favourite movie where
  they can remember exactly where they were when they saw it, and exactly how
  they felt when that two-hour journey was over. But there is no one who has sat
  through a two-hour chunk of TikTok who will remember anything about it at all.
  There is no emotional defining moment. They are two completely different
  experiences. And yet it’s getting harder and harder to get people to see
  movies.” He’s hardly alone in his thinking; most big-name directors feel the
  same. Where he breaks from the script, though, is in his embrace of AI. In
  May, the director announced the launch of a bespoke new studio, Primordial
  Soup, in tandem with Google DeepMind. Under the terms of this partnership,
  Google provides generative AI tools to Aronofsky and his team, while they
  provide feedback that helps refine and develop the technology. AI more than
  anything else is viewed as the greatest threat to cinema, so I’m wondering
  precisely what Aronofksy gets from the deal. “Well, this is the new front in
  the war on meme culture,” he says. “These tools are coming. They’re being used
  at an incredible adoption rate, but they’re mostly being used for slop. So I
  feel that, as storytellers, we need to harness these tools to help us do our
  work. There are a lot of artists who are fighting against AI, but I don’t see
  that as making any sense. If we don’t shape these tools, somebody else will.”
  “You keep calling them tools,” I begin. “They are tools,” he shoots back. But
  we’re not talking about putting a new paintbrush in the hands of an artist.
  We’re talking about potentially replacing the artist. “No, no, that’s not
  happening,” he says, properly vexed by the notion. “People are still going to
  be making films in the traditional way. But the technology is happening, the
  tools are happening. So it’s like if someone invents fire. You don’t say, ‘Oh,
  let’s not mess with this because it might burn down our house.’ There’s never
  been a technology that shows up that people aren’t going to use.” It was fear
  of an unchained, omnivorous AI that prompted the 2023 writers and actors’
  strike in Hollywood. So I’m assuming Aronofsky’s position makes him a rarity
  among his peers. “Yeah, publicly I am,” he admits. “But I’ve been in touch
  with so many people who are deeply curious. And again: it’s already happening.
  There’s a generation of young people already playing with these tools. So
  we’re going to see new types of images and a lot of content that’s different –
  that’s not just mimicking other movies but is really doing something new.”
  We’ve been talking over tea for a little under an hour. We started in grungy
  1990s New York; we’re ending up in the future, in the brave new sci-fi world.
  Despite all the dangers, that’s probably the right trajectory. The past can be
  golden, but it can also be a trap. “I don’t want to be one of those old men
  shouting at clouds,” he says. “Or shouting at the TV set, ‘Elvis Presley’s
  moving his hips and he needs to be banned.’ The world is changing. I’m trying
  to lean into the excitement. It’s time to shut up, stop complaining and
  dance.” • Caught Stealing is out in the UK on 29 August
