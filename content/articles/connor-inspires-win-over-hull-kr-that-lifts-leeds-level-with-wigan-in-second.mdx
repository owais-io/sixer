  If you weren’t sure this Leeds side are firmly in the Super League title
  equation, then you are now. For clarity, teams very rarely defeat Hull KR:
  this is only the fourth time they have tasted defeat in 2025 and two of them
  have been by the Rhinos. It is also the first time they have lost by 20 points
  or more in almost 18 months. This was not just a victory for Brad Arthur’s
  side. It was a statement that Super League title No 9 may not be too far away
  for a team who are rejuvenated under the guidance of the Australian.
  Back-to-back eighth-placed finishes in 2023 and 2024 seem a distant past; this
  is now a side capable of going the distance this autumn. For 80 minutes here,
  Headingley felt like the good old days when league titles were more of a
  formality than they were a possibility. With a raucous crowd behind them and
  Leeds playing a wonderful brand of rugby, they blew the Super League leaders
  away from start to finish. In doing so, they breathed new life into their push
  for a place in the top two come the playoffs. The League Leaders’ Shield is
  doubtless heading to Hull KR, but second place is now firmly up for grabs,
  with Leeds level on points with Wigan with four rounds remaining – and that
  brings with it huge positives come the playoffs. The top two get a bye through
  the opening round of the play-offs and a home semi-final too. All of a sudden,
  few would back against Leeds. Leading 18-0 at half-time thanks to tries from
  Jake Connor, Presley Cassell and Lachie Miller, there was never much chance of
  a Rovers comeback on an off-night for them, but a stellar one for Leeds. “I
  feel like it’s been building towards that,” Arthur said following their best
  performance of 2025. Miller was at the heart of everything they did well,
  laying on a try for Connor before Cassell, the latest product of their fine
  academy, surged through to make it 12-0. Miller then rounded the Hull KR
  defence to make it 18-0 long before the half-hour mark. Having delivered a
  wonderful display at the reigning champions, Wigan Warriors, last week, this
  was perhaps an understandably low-key evening for Rovers. But the standards
  they have set in recent years means this will be a difficult night to review.
  “It wasn’t a good performance or result,” their coach, Willie Peters, said.
  “They had more aggression and intent, and they strolled through us.” Any
  notion of a Hull KR comeback had to come through an early try after half-time
  to breathe life into the contest, but Leeds’ defensive efforts meant that felt
  unlikely. There were half-chances, but the Rhinos always felt in control of
  proceedings. Connor’s penalty to make it a four-score lead only emphasised
  that further before another scintillating attacking move led to Harry Newman
  scoring their fourth try of the night. Another penalty from the boot of Connor
  as Rovers continued to toil then made it 28-0 and at that stage, the prospect
  of Hull KR being beaten to nil for the first time since May 2022 appeared to
  be on the cards. They at least avoided that ignominy when Tom Davies crossed
  in the corner with five minutes left, but the damage had long since been done
  and the statement long since been made. Perhaps it was fitting Leeds delivered
  a performance like this here too, on the night when the late, great Rob
  Burrow’s family were in attendance. How he would have absolutely loved his
  beloved Rhinos producing something quite as emphatic as this.
