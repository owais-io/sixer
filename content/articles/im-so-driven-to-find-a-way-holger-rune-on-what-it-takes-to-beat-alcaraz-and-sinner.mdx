  and Sinner

  “My aim is to win as many grand slams as possible and be No 1 in the world,”
  Holger Rune says with cool assurance on a stinking hot day in Cincinnati.
  “It’s very, very clear for me and it’s always been like that since I was a
  child.” The 22-year-old Dane is the world No 11 and he has reached the
  quarter-finals of Wimbledon and, on two occasions, the French Open. As the US
  Open approaches, he has yet to make the semi-finals of a grand slam but his
  bold ambition seems more concrete when his impressive record against the best
  two players in the world is remembered. Rune has played Carlos Alcaraz four
  times, winning twice, including a 7-6 (6), 6-2 victory in their most recent
  encounter, four months ago in the final of the Barcelona Open. He has also
  beaten Jannik Sinner twice in their five matches against each other. Rune was
  on course to face Sinner again in the semi-finals of the Cincinnati Open but,
  last Thursday, he suffered a straight-sets defeat against Térence Atmane. The
  French qualifier, whose ATP Tour record before Cincinnati featured one win in
  five matches this year, described his tournament as “pretty insane” because,
  before dispatching Rune, he also knocked out the world No 4, Taylor Fritz. But
  Rune’s variable results against lower-ranked players continue. “My problem is
  not beating those guys,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “My problem is being
  consistent in going deep in every tournament to get a chance to play them more
  often because I feel like that’s where I raise my level. It’s very clear that
  when Carlos and Jannik play each other they raise their level. You push each
  other like crazy and this is a very exciting element of the sport. So having a
  good head-to-head against them, and also in the beginning against Novak
  Djokovic when he was on top, makes me know I can do it. It’s just about
  delivering it consistently.” Rune, who is as friendly off-court as he can be
  intense and combustible in matches, says, “There have been a few days where
  you’re like: ‘How is it going to be possible?’ But I’m so driven to find a
  way. I’m always thinking: ‘How can I achieve my goals? What can I do better?’”
  He explains that, with his coach Lars Christensen, “we are trying to work
  really hard, but also really smart, to improve and stay really consistent. But
  that’s the most difficult part and basically only two players on tour right
  now are very consistent – Carlos and Jannik. Everybody else is losing early in
  tournaments here and there.” Rune is easy to interview and open to analysing
  his challenges – which he argues are primarily mental. “It starts with the
  brain, with knowing when you play well or, when you turn the match, why it
  happened so you can do it again and it doesn’t just happen by coincidence. I’m
  a good tennis player so of course I’m going to have good weeks. But it’s about
  trying to put them together – not just a few times but week after week.” As
  part of his new strategy Rune met Andre Agassi last month. Agassi is a great
  former world No 1 who won each of the four grand slam tournaments and eight in
  total. The 55-year-old American is an unconventional and deep thinker whose
  love-hate relationship with tennis could not dull his tactical acumen. It’s an
  intriguing move by Rune. He is working again with Christensen, who coached him
  as a junior and at different stages of his senior career, but his five years
  on tour have been marked by constant tinkering. Rune has also been coached by
  Patrick Mouratoglou, who worked successfully with Serena Williams, and Boris
  Becker, winner of six grand slams as a player. There is no suggestion that
  Agassi will become his coach and, instead, an informal relationship seems to
  be helping Rune. They worked together for three days in Washington DC and,
  since then, Agassi and Rune have spoken or messaged each other before or after
  his matches. “It was my idea,” Rune says. “I reached out to him after the
  French Open and thought it would be really interesting to hear his point of
  view on my game. We spoke on the phone for a long time and decided to do a
  couple of days together in DC. He sees tennis in a very unique way and had
  some good info on my game. We had a long dinner and the way he explained
  things made it simple for me to see what I can do better. “He’s such a legend
  with a deep understanding of tennis and how to win. So for him to share that
  with me was amazing. We’re still in touch and speak after my matches on the
  phone and it helps to hear his thoughts.” Does Agassi believe Rune is a future
  grand slam winner? “Yes. He made that very clear. He knows all my goals and
  said they are very achievable. But it’s more important to make it happen than
  just hearing it. Belief is the most important word. I believe I can do it and,
  I’m sure, in time I’ll make it.” Alcaraz was born six days after Rune, in May
  2003, while Sinner is two years older at 24. The Spaniard has won five slams,
  the first the 2022 US Open, and the Italian has four to his name, starting
  with last year’s Australian Open. “Carlos is by far the one doing it the
  fastest. When Jannik won his first slam he was my age now – 22. So I have a
  little more time to try and do the same. He’s always been an amazing player.
  It’s not like he just did something crazy all of a sudden. He was working very
  consistently, very hard. And then great things happen because he has the
  tennis and the physicality. So he shows that it’s about trusting the process,
  believing, optimising and making it happen.” Who is more difficult to beat –
  Sinner or Alcaraz? “I always found it more comfortable playing Jannik because
  he’s giving more rhythm, playing more the same shots. With Carlos there’s so
  much variety. You give him one opportunity and he’s going to either drop shot
  you or punch you down the line or something different. It’s unpredictable,
  which makes it more difficult. But Jannik’s lower level is higher because
  Carlos sometimes can mis-hit some balls. But then I think Carlos’s top game is
  a little bit higher than Jannik’s so they’re really equal.” Rune is friendly
  with both but particularly Alcaraz as, when they were 12, they became double
  partners in a junior tournament and reached the semi-finals. “He’s always been
  a nice guy,” Rune says, “and we’re good friends now.” His defeat of Alcaraz in
  Barcelona deepened Rune’s belief. “Obviously I had some nerves but I was
  excited to play that match. The first set was a big battle. I had a few set
  points at 5-4 but I won a big tie-break and then I got more and more momentum
  and had a great second set. Beating Carlos in the final was an amazing
  feeling. The only annoying thing was I wasn’t consistently doing enough in the
  next tournament.” His mother, Aneke, has followed every twist and turn. She is
  often at his side off-court and almost always in his box during matches. She
  sometimes looks in desperate need of another cigarette, as her desire to win
  seems to run as deep as her son’s. Rune smiles at that observation. “For sure.
  It’s been the whole project since I was six years old when I told her: ‘I want
  to win grand slams and be No 1 in the world.’ She was like: ‘OK, I will try to
  do everything for you so that’s possible.’” Tennis remains an obscure sport in
  Denmark and he received little support from the national federation. “My mum
  luckily has her own [water cooler] company so this made it a little easier for
  her to take time off and travel. But tennis is very expensive and on the lower
  level you had to pay for your hotel and food. My mum and dad sacrificed their
  time, their money, their life for me. I feel like I owe them everything.” How
  has his mother helped him most? “With my mindset. She’s basically the person
  that helped me get the killer instinct. She’s very demanding but in a good way
  and very supportive and very loving. I think this is what makes her a great
  parent – not just to be nice all the time but also to be honest.” Life on tour
  can be hard and Rune says, almost casually, that he and other players receive
  death threats on social media “all the time. After every match you lose that,
  on paper, you should have won, it happens”. The threats are made by “people
  betting on the matches and it’s just not nice. People threatening you and your
  family and talking very direct things is really uncomfortable. It’s one thing
  that’s really bad about social media … [and] it’s dangerous in some ways.”
  Having reached the final at Indian Wells in March, where he lost to Jack
  Draper, the rest of 2025 has been patchy. But who else has the potential to
  challenge the Alcaraz-Sinner duopoly? “That’s a great question. I wouldn’t
  have thought much about that. I want to see how Arthur Fils develops because
  he has a great forehand, great backhand, great physique.” The 21-year-old
  Frenchman has withdrawn from the US Open with a stress fracture in his back.
  “He has many elements to his game and I’m curious to see how he’s going to do
  but otherwise I don’t know for the moment.” What about Draper, the world No 5
  who reached the US Open semi-finals last year? “He has a great game but I
  don’t want to say like, oh, he can or he cannot, because everything is
  possible. But it’s tough because if you want to win a slam you might have to
  beat both Jannik and Carlos and maybe Novak and he’s still playing well in big
  tournaments. It’s tough.” Rune’s first US Open match, in 2021, was against
  Djokovic. But, even at 18, he did not look intimidated and won the second set.
  “Maybe I knew I could win,” he says with a grin. “Obviously I was crazy
  nervous because it was my first time in a big stadium and then playing maybe
  the greatest of all time. That was nerve-racking but so exciting. In the first
  set I was shaking a little but after I won the second I was believing
  straightaway: ‘OK, I can beat this guy.’ But my physicality was not great back
  then. I started to cramp and all the emotion and stress from qualifying didn’t
  help. But it was amazing to get a sense of that level so early in my career.”
  He has suffered further first-round defeats in his two most recent US Open
  appearances. “I’ve not played very well the last few years in New York,” Rune
  admits as attention returns to his recurring grand slam aspirations. “But it’s
  a tournament I always wanted to win and I still want to win. I’m ready to do a
  lot better.”
