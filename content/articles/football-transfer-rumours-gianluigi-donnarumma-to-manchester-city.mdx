  If you had suggested, as Gianluigi Donnarumma’s Brobdingnagian hands were
  extinguishing Arsenal’s Champions League hopes in May, that Paris
  Saint-Germain would bundle him out the door marked Do One a few months later,
  you’d have been laughed out of the football WhatsApp group faster than you
  could say “Toxic Hipsters”. Who’s laughing now? You are! Or at least you would
  be had the above scenario been a representation of reality rather than the
  Rumour Mill’s exhausted imagination. Luis Enrique wants a different profile of
  goalkeeper – imagine if someone had used that phrase within earshot of Brian
  Clough or Bill Shankly – and Donnarumma may well be using his giant frame and
  even bigger aura in the Premier League this season. Chelsea, Manchester City
  and Manchester United are among the sides unable to believe their potential
  luck. If Pep Guardiola draws the 6ft 4in straw, Ederson will be offloaded to
  Galatasaray faster than you can say “we need a different profile of
  goalkeeper, Brian”. Real Madrid are considering cutting out the middle man,
  known in some cultures as Liverpool Football Club, by buying Adam Wharton
  direct from Crystal Palace. Any move is unlikely to happen this summer.
  Liverpool have eyes on a different Eagle, the Palace captain, Marc Guéhi.
  Parma’s teenage centre-back Giovanni Leoni also gives good data and is a
  potential back-up. Palace immortal Eberechi Eze is still being courted by
  Spurs and Arsenal, with Thomas Frank’s manic charisma putting Spurs in pole
  position. Newcastle’s windus horribilis will improve a bit if they secure the
  signing of Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa, who in turn would like to re-sign
  Marco Asensio on loan from PSG. Bayer Leverkusen have their peepers trained on
  Brighton’s Facundo Buonanotte, while their forward Amine Adli could be on his
  way to Bournemouth. Christopher Nkunku wants to leave Chelsea for Bayern
  Munich, while Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho has reportedly (OK, OK,
  someone said so on Twitter.com) told his nearest and dearest that Chelsea are
  the only club he wants to join. Manchester United, meanwhile, are dreaming of
  Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano. Aren’t we all? Last, and definitely not least
  because he looks a damn fine player, West Ham have reportedly had a £30m offer
  for Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes turned down. But like the haemorrhoids,
  they’ll be back.
