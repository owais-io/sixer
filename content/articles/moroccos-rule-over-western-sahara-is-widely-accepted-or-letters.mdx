  Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara was recognised by Britain in our
  Treaty of Friendship of 1721, and is supported by President Trump’s US and
  President Macron’s France, among others (Christopher Nolan criticised for
  filming in occupied Western Sahara city, 28 July). Britain has also recognised
  Morocco’s autonomy proposal as “the most credible, viable and pragmatic basis
  for a lasting resolution of the dispute” over the area in a joint communique
  signed by the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and his Moroccan counterpart,
  Nasser Bourita, in June. The majority of the population in the Sahara welcomes
  Morocco’s sovereignty and development of its economy. I’ve seen it with my own
  eyes. Morocco’s critics mentioned in your article are out of touch. Andrew M
