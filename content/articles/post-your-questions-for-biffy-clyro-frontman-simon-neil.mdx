  After a remarkable rise from cult math-emo band to brawny arena-filling
  rockers, Biffy Clyro reach the 10-album milestone with their next release,
  Futique. Ahead of it coming out on 19 September, frontman Simon Neil will take
  on your questions. With Neil on vocals and guitars backed by twin brother
  rhythm section of James and Ben Johnston, the trio released their debut album
  Blackened Sky back in 2002, the start of a dogged, delightful march into the
  mainstream. Trailing sudden dynamic shifts and eye-catching song titles in
  their wake (special mention for Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys, ...
  And With the Scissorkick Is Victorious and There’s No Such Thing as a Jaggy
  Snake), they jumped to a major label for 2007’s Puzzle, to double-platinum
  sales with follow-up Only Revolutions and to the top of the UK album chart
  with 2013’s Opposites. Since then there’s been two more UK No 1 albums,
  headline slots at Download and Reading and Leeds festivals, and a series of
  arena tours. Now with what is tantamount to a greatest hits set – featuring
  Many of Horror, Mountains, Bubbles and so many more – the next one begins in
  January, with stellar support from Soft Play and the Armed. Neil has also
  found time for side projects Marmaduke Duke, Empire State Bastard and ZZC, and
  co-wrote a film, Balance, Not Symmetry, for which Biffy Clyro also did the
  soundtrack. It’s a huge body of work to get into with him – post your
  questions by Wednesday 10 September, and we’ll publish his answers on 19
  September.
