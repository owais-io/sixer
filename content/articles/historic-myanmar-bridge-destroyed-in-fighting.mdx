  A colonial-era bridge in Myanmar that was once the world’s tallest railway
  trestle has been destroyed during fighting in the years-long conflict. A civil
  war has consumed Myanmar since a 2021 coup deposed the civilian government,
  with the military battling myriad pro-democracy guerrilla groups and ethnic
  armed organisations. Representatives from the ruling military junta and
  anti-coup armed groups have blamed each other for the destruction of the
  landmark Gokteik bridge on Sunday. In a video statement, junta spokesperson
  Zaw Min Tun claimed rebel factions, including the Ta’ang National Liberation
  Army (TNLA) and people’s defence forces groups had “bombed and destroyed” the
  bridge. A separate statement by the junta said the bridge had been “exploded
  with mines”. A TNLA spokesperson rejected this and accused the junta of
  bombing the bridge. “[The] Myanmar army tried to bomb our bases ... this
  morning by using drones. They bombed our troops, but their bomb also hit
  Gokteik bridge,” TNLA spokesperson Lway Yay Oo said. In recent weeks, clashes
  have erupted between junta forces and TNLA fighters in the nearby towns of
  Nawnghkio and Kyaukme – though the junta claimed to have recaptured Nawnghkio
  in July. Spanning 300 metres and standing 102 metres above a gorge, the
  structure is the highest bridge in Myanmar and was the tallest railway trestle
  in the world when it opened in 1901 during the British colonial era. Videos
  and photos on social media showed the bridge partly collapsed and damaged. The
  bridge is situated at the border of the Nawnghkio and Kyaukme townships in
  northern Shan State. It is part of the Mandalay-Lashio railway line and draws
  a number of tourists. Myanmar’s junta is preparing for a December election
  that is being boycotted by opposition groups and criticised by international
  monitors. Analysts have predicted rebels will stage offensives around the
  election as a sign of their opposition. With Agence France-Presse
