  The Edinburgh comedy award, the annual “Oscar of comedy” given to the best
  show at the fringe, has been won by Sam Nicoresti for Baby Doomer, which is
  based around a humiliating experience in a department store changing room. The
  Birmingham standup becomes the first transgender winner of the prestigious
  award after near-misses for Jordan Gray in 2022 – and Eddie Izzard 34 years
  ago. Nicoresti pockets £10,000 in prize money and, on accepting the award,
  joked they had promised their partner the win a year ago to help pay for their
  upcoming wedding. At a ceremony hosted very amusingly by last year’s winner
  Amy Gledhill, the best newcomer prize, worth £5,000, was won by Ayoade
  Bamgboye, for the show Swings and Roundabouts. The Londoner, who was raised in
  Nigeria, was in tears on receiving the award, which has in the past launched
  the careers of acts including Sarah Millican, Harry Hill and The Mighty Boosh.
  The Victoria Wood award, presented to those who “embody the true spirit of the
  fringe”, went to Comedy Club 4 Kids, which runs children’s standup shows and
  workshops, on its 20th anniversary. The director of the comedy awards, the
  West End theatre producer Nica Burns, said: “Our 2025 winners capture the
  spirit of comedy right now: bold, brilliant and deeply connected to audiences.
  In different ways, they’ve each created shows that feel utterly of this
  moment, sparking laughter while saying something lasting. Together, they
  remind us why the fringe matters, a place where the freshest voices can
  shine.” Traditionally rounding off the three-plus-week festival, the ceremony
  took place at noon on Saturday before an audience of comics and industry
  figures. Stepping into a lineage of irreverent co-hosts of the award, the
  former winners Adam Riches and John Kearns appeared in character as crooners
  Ball and Boe, delivering edgy gags – as Gledhill did – about the fringe’s
  ambivalent relationship with Scottish comedy and the residents of Edinburgh.
  Give or take the leagues-ahead quality of the former best newcomer Cat Cohen’s
  show Broad Strokes, mystifyingly not represented on the shortlist (and
  attended last night by Tina Fey), Nicoresti’s victory was well earned.
  Pivoting this year to high-joke-count standup after finding early success with
  more leftfield work (they are a prominent member of a comedy collective called
  Weirdos), their show addresses life as a trans woman in a spirit of joy,
  playfulness and self-irony that could clearly capture the hearts of mainstream
  audiences. I welcome their win – although I’d have been equally happy to see
  another star-in-the-making John Tothill rewarded. After brushes with malaria
  and appendicitis in recent years (as recounted in this year’s show), Tothill
  must content himself with at least having completed his first fringe run not
  to result in a near-death experience. A nomination for the queer Canadian
  performance art/comedy duo the Creepy Boys, with their show Slugs, ensured
  welcome representation at comedy’s top table for the fringiest of fringe work.
  Bamgboye’s win was incontrovertible: sharp, commanding and with star quality
  in spades, she’s going places. Hopefully one of those places will be next
  year’s fringe. The festival continues to be the most electrifying destination
  in live comedy. Figures to be released in the coming weeks will demonstrate
  how the event has fared commercially in tough times for the performing arts.
  But, as the comedy awards again proved, for new talent, wild creativity and
  big laughs – and for practitioners and audience both – the Edinburgh fringe
  remains the most thrilling place to be.
