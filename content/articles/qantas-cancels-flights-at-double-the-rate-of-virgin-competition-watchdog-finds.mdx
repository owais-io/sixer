  Qantas has cancelled flights at double the rate of Virgin, its main
  competitor, which had the lowest monthly cancellation rates of any major
  domestic airline over the past year. Air fares across major Australian
  airlines have also surged relative to the price of jet fuel in 2025, new
  analysis from the competition watchdog shows. Virgin Australia cancelled just
  1.6% of its flights on average over the year to June, while the Qantas group
  cancelled 3.2%, or almost one in every 30, of its scheduled flights.
  Cancellation rates typically average 2.2%, according to an Australian
  Competition and Consumer Commission report released on Tuesday. Jetstar beat
  both airlines in the month of June, cancelling just 1.1% of flights. Sign up:
  AU Breaking News email The Canberra-Sydney flight route has seen above-average
  cancellations, hitting 12% in June, or nearly 15% for the Qantas group and
  half that for Virgin-leased Link services. “The airlines have cited poor
  weather, including strong winds in Sydney and fog in Canberra,” the ACCC
  report read. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Qantas said: “We have had
  the most on time flights of the major domestic airlines for the past year, but
  our cancellation rate has been higher than it should be. “We have a number of
  initiatives in place to improve our operational performance.” Cancellations
  across the industry have declined since 2023, as have late arrivals, which
  fell to a three-year low of less than 18%. Just 15.2% of Virgin flights were
  late in May, the lowest proportion for any major airline since monitoring
  began in 2022, though that picked up to 20.4% in June, just higher than
  Qantas’s 19.6%. While airline performance has improved, prices for customers
  have risen, the ACCC found. Average air fares were much higher in April 2025
  than the same month in 2024, even after adjusting for inflation, as
  back-to-back public holidays saw demand surge. Airlines also raked in more
  revenue per passenger in June 2025 than they did in June 2024, despite
  downward pressure on operating costs from falling jet fuel prices, the ACCC
  said. At the same time, airlines were flying 172,000 fewer seats across
  Australia in June than they had been in 2019, even though customer demand has
  returned to pre-pandemic levels. “This has likely resulted in people paying
  more to fly than they would have otherwise,” the watchdog’s report read.
  Customers may have tried to manage rising costs by using airline loyalty
  points but the ACCC warned the frequent flyer programs may not deliver value
  and could push consumers to spend more than they otherwise would. “Consumers
  need to weigh the potential benefits of frequent flyer points which may lose
  value, expire, or be difficult to redeem against the upfront cost of the
  flight,” the ACCC’s report read. Frequent flyer programs represented nearly a
  quarter of both Qantas’s and Virgin’s underlying earnings in 2023-24,
  respectively $511m and $115m. Qantas in August devalued points for its
  frequent flyers. Last year the federal court told Qantas to pay a $100m
  penalty for selling thousands of tickets for flights it had already decided to
  cancel. In some cases, air fares were offered for up to 62 days after Qantas
  had decided to cancel a flight, the airline conceded.
