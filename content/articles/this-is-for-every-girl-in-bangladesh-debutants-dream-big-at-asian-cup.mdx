  The sun was starting to break through Dhaka’s morning haze when a bus pulled
  up beside the pitch at the Bashundhara Kings Arena just after 5.30am. As the
  doors hissed open, the girls tumbled out one by one, hair tied back, boots
  slung over shoulders, already wide awake and buzzing with energy. It was the
  start of another dawn practice session for the Bangladesh women’s national
  football team, but spirits were high. With internationals on the horizon and
  competition growing stronger, the girls had no time to spare. At the front of
  the squad was Afeida Khandaker, the fierce and quietly confident captain who
  recently led Bangladesh to qualify for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup for the first
  time. “I want our girls to be recognised for their brilliance and our recent
  victory did exactly that,” the 18-year-old defender says proudly. “But we are
  only just getting started. We want to show the world what Bangladesh is truly
  capable of.” The team topped Group C in the 2026 qualifiers, defeating Bahrain
  7-0, Myanmar 2-1 and Turkmenistan 7-0 to finish with nine points from three
  matches. They now join teams such as Japan, China and South Korea in Australia
  next year, and a top finish there could seal qualification for the Women’s
  World Cup and even the Olympic Games, marking a major milestone in their
  football journey. The group have also achieved their biggest ever leap in the
  Fifa world rankings, rising 24 places to 104th, the highest gain among all
  nations in the latest cycle. “This achievement isn’t just ours – it belongs to
  every girl in Bangladesh who dares to dream,” says Khandaker. “It’s proof of
  what faith, hard work, and unity can achieve. But we’re not stopping here. The
  next few months of preparation will be tough but we are up for the challenge.”
  Back in their hotel rooms, the team are more relaxed; lounging around in PJs,
  making TikTok videos and packing for a flight the following morning. Many of
  them are still adjusting to life as national footballers. Having come from
  mostly disadvantaged backgrounds, they’re learning to navigate a new world
  away from home structured around training, strict routines, and nutrition
  charts. Despite having access to room service at five-star hotels, the girls
  have been using kettles to boil potatoes and scissors to cut up onions to make
  bhorta, a traditional Bangladeshi dish. “We’re still getting used to
  international cuisine,” says Khandaker sheepishly. “And sometimes after a big
  game, we just want some comfort food. A little something from back home.”
  Khandaker had a modest upbringing in Satkhira, south-west Bangladesh, where
  her father, an avid footballer, once played at district level. He aspired to
  play internationally but, like many Bangladeshi men, had no choice but to
  abandon his dreams and migrate to the middle east to support his family. When
  he returned he had saved enough to start a small business and set up an
  amateur football academy for local kids; Khandaker and her elder sister Afra
  were his first students. “My passion for football comes from my father,” says
  the captain. “He wanted to prove that girls could play football just as well
  as boys – if not better – and pushed us harder than anyone else.” As children,
  when the siblings were too tired to train or run laps, their father would
  chase them around a field with mud in his hands, recalls Khandaker, laughing.
  “At home he was our abbu, but on the field he was our coach and he never gave
  us a day off!” Their hard work paid off. Aged 11, Khandaker was selected for
  the Bangladesh Football Federation’s national training camp while Afra pivoted
  to boxing and recently competed in the semi-finals of Bangladesh’s national
  boxing championship. “We’re really lucky to have supportive parents and hope
  our success inspires other girls to pursue sport without self-doubt,” says
  Khandaker. “We’ve worked really hard to get to where we are but without a
  proper support system none of it would have been possible.” Khandaker and her
  teammates are determined to excel internationally, and the British head coach,
  Peter Butler, believes they are well on their way. “It’s been a tough few
  months of development, intense training and building resilience,” says the
  former West Ham midfielder. “But the girls have shown remarkable progress and
  I’m dead proud. This is a young group playing fearlessly against teams ranked
  significantly higher than them – they’re improving with every game and
  becoming a force to be reckoned with.” Butler has been training the team since
  March 2024 and it’s not just his discipline and work ethic that have rubbed
  off – some of the girls have started pronouncing English words with a
  Yorkshire accent. A few months after Butler arrived in Dhaka, a student
  uprising that sparked mass protests throughout the country quickly turned
  violent with hundreds killed at the hands of security forces. The uprising led
  to the establishment of an interim government under the Nobel laureate
  Muhammad Yunus, which has focused on stabilising the country. But, in the wake
  of the political shift, activists say there is still a lot of work to be done.
  Earlier this year, radicals vandalised a pitch before a women’s football
  match, causing its cancellation, creating uproar on social media and fear
  among the women’s team that their games may be affected too. But the
  Bangladesh Football Federation quickly stepped in, issuing strong statements
  and putting security measures in place. “It’s sad that there are people who
  still think girls shouldn’t be playing football,” says Khandaker. “Bangladeshi
  women are leading in all aspects of the public sphere – the pitch should be no
  exception.” The threats have not deterred Khandaker and her teammates who
  continue proving the naysayers wrong and remain hopeful for the future. “I
  remember watching the World Cup on TV with my family in 2022 and wishing I
  could be there,” recalls Khandaker, who was invited to tour Qatar earlier this
  year. “It felt impossible at the time but as I stood there silently in that
  vast stadium, I wondered what other dreams of mine were within reach”. With
  the team headed to Australia next year, victory may come sooner than they
  think. Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our
