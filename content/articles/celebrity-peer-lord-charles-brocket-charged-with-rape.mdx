  A celebrity peer and former reality TV show contestant has appeared in court
  after being charged with rape and sexual assault by penetration, police said.
  Lord Charles Brocket, 73, a contestant on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of
  Here!, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday. He was charged
  with two counts of rape in London on 10 August and one count of sexual assault
  by penetration in the village of Warbleton, East Sussex, on 5 May, the
  Metropolitan police said. Brocket, from Fulham, west London, spoke to confirm
  his name, date of birth and address during the hearing, where the allegations
  were outlined by the prosecutor Aarya Mishra. They all relate to the same
  woman, who cannot be identified because she is an alleged victim of sexual
  offences. The aristocrat, 73, who was arrested on Friday, was not asked to
  enter pleas to any of the charges, which can only be tried at the crown court,
  but the court heard he denies the allegations. The district judge, Louisa
  Ciecióra, granted him bail with conditions including a GPS tag-monitored
  exclusion from coming within the M25. Ciecióra said Brocket must attend
  Isleworth crown court in west London for the next hearing on 26 September. A
  Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Brocket was arrested on Friday 29
  August on suspicion of rape and charged on Saturday 30 August. “The rape
  charges relate to an incident involving a woman that took place in the early
  hours of Saturday 10 August in Fulham. The matter was reported to police the
  same day. “The sexual assault by penetration charge relates to an incident on
  Monday 5 May in Warbleton, East Sussex. “The victim is being supported by
  specialist officers.” Brocket finished fourth in the 2004 series of I’m a
  Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! when Kerry Katona, the former pop singer, was
  declared the winner.
