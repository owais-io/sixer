  Keely Hodgkinson and her training partner, Georgia Hunter-Bell, will vie for
  an audacious British one-two over 800m at the World Athletics Championships
  after UK Athletics announced its team for Tokyo. Hunter-Bell had faced the
  difficult decision over whether to run the 1500m, where she won bronze last
  year at the Paris Olympics, or the shorter distance. However, after much
  deliberation, her form over the 800m – including two Diamond League victories
  in Stockholm and London – and the lack of depth in the event has pushed her
  towards two laps. Hodgkinson, who returned this month from a 376-day layoff to
  run the ninth fastest time in history, is by some distance Britain’s best
  chance of gold in Tokyo as she seeks to back up her Olympic title. However
  there will be several other Britons with medal aspirations, including the
  Budapest 2023 world champions Josh Kerr and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the
  men’s 1500m and women’s heptathlon. Matthew Hudson-Smith will also be among
  the favourites in the men’s 400m. Elsewhere George Mills, who broke Mo Farah’s
  British 5,000m record this summer, is selected after breaking his wrist in the
  London Diamond League. Emile Cairess, who came fourth in the Olympic marathon
  in Paris, also returns after injury forced him to miss the London marathon in
  April. Paula Dunn, the performance director of UK Athletics, promised that the
  British team would rise to the occasion as they seek to emulate their
  record-equalling total of 10 medals from the world championships in Budapest
  two years ago. “We are proud to announce such a strong team for Tokyo,” she
  said. “This squad combines proven global medallists with exciting emerging
  athletes, and we are confident they can build on our recent successes at the
  highest level. “Our clear ambition is to convert world-class performances into
  medals, while also developing depth across events for the future. Tokyo will
  provide the perfect stage to demonstrate the strength of British athletics,
  and I know the athletes will rise to the occasion.”
