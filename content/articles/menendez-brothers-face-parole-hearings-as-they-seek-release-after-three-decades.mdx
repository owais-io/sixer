  The Menendez brothers are scheduled to face separate parole hearings beginning
  Thursday, marking the closest they have been to winning freedom after spending
  nearly 30 years in prison in the slaying of their parents inside their Los
  Angeles home. Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison
  for killing their father, José Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their
  Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time. Defense
  attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual
  abuse by their father, while prosecutors said the brothers killed their
  parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance. A panel of two or three parole
  hearing officers from a board of commissioners will evaluate each of the
  brothers via video conference. Erik Menendez will have his hearing on Thursday
  morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday, from prison in San Diego. The
  brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced
  their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50
  years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole under California
  law because they were under 26 when they committed their crimes. The board
  will assess whether the brothers pose an “unreasonable risk of danger to
  society” if released, considering factors such as criminal history, motivation
  for the crime and signs of remorse, behavior while in prison and plans for the
  future, according to the California department of corrections and
  rehabilitation. Nathan Hochman, the Los Angeles district attorney, has opposed
  releasing the brothers and argued they have failed to take full responsibility
  for their crimes. “We have consistently opposed their release because they
  have not demonstrated full insight into their crimes or shown that they have
  been fully rehabilitated, and therefore continue to pose a risk to society,”
  he said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that his office will evaluate its
  final position based on the evidence shared at this week’s hearing. Even if
  the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers
  walk free – if at all. If the board grants each brother’s parole, the chief
  legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then, the Democratic governor,
  Gavin Newsom, has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole. Only then, if Newsom
  affirms the parole, would the Menendez brothers be able to leave prison.
  Newsom had previously ordered the state parole board to conduct a risk
  assessment of the brothers in response to a clemency request. At the time, he
  emphasized that the key question was whether the brothers posed an
  “unreasonable risk to public safety”. He noted at a May news conference that
  he has approved and rejected decisions by the parole board before and that he
  was the “ultimate arbiter”. The brothers’ lawyer, Mark Geragos, sought release
  last month for Erik Menendez after he was hospitalized for a “serious medical
  condition”. He has since returned to prison. The case has captured the
  attention of true crime enthusiasts for decades and spawned documentaries,
  television specials and dramatizations. The Netflix drama Monsters: The Lyle
  and Erik Menendez Story and the documentary The Menendez Brothers, both
  released in 2024, have been credited for bringing new attention to the
  brothers. In the last year, support from celebrities such as Kim Kardashian
  and a greater recognition of the brothers as victims of sexual abuse has
  helped amass a legion of supporters who have called for their release. Some
  have flown to Los Angeles over the past few months, holding rallies and
  attending court hearings as the brothers’ attorneys pushed for their
  resentencing. The previous LA county district attorney, George Gascón, first
  opened the door to possible freedom for the brothers last fall by asking a
  judge to reduce their sentences. Since their conviction, the brothers have
  gotten an education, participated in self-help classes and started various
  support groups for fellow people in prison, his office said in a petition. The
  judge’s decision to ultimately resentence the brothers followed months of
  pushback from current prosecutors. The Menendez brothers still have a pending
  habeas corpus petition filed in May 2023 seeking a review of their convictions
  based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.
  Last month, a different judge ordered Los Angeles prosecutors to explain why
  their case should not be reexamined. The state corrections department has
  selected one media representative to view the proceedings virtually and share
  notes with the rest of the press at set intervals. Dani Anguiano contributed
