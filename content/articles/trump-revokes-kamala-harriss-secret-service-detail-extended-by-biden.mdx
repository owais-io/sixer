  Donald Trump has revoked Secret Service protection for the former
  vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris,
  according to a letter obtained by CNN and confirmed to the Guardian by a
  senior White House official. The letter, dated on Thursday and titled
  “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security”, instructs the Secret
  Service to “discontinue any security-related procedures beyond those required
  by law” effective 1 September 2025. Under federal law, former vice-presidents
  are entitled to receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving
  office. For Harris, that period ended on 21 July. However, CNN reports that
  her protection had been extended for an additional year under an undisclosed
  directive signed by then president Joe Biden before leaving office. Trump’s
  new directive cancels that extension. “You are hereby authorized to
  discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive
  Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual,
  effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the
  letter reads. The Secret Service did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s
  request for comment. Kirsten Allen, a senior adviser to Harris, said that
  Harris “is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their
  professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety”. The network
  also reported that Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, was
  briefed on the situation late on Thursday. His office did not comment on any
  potential replacement security arrangements that may be put in place for
  Harris, who is a resident of California, but Newsom’s spokesperson criticized
  the decision. “The safety of our public officials should never be subject to
  erratic, vindictive political impulses,” the spokesperson said. The Los
  Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, has also reportedly been in touch with Newsom
  following the news. As a resident of Los Angeles, Harris could receive
  protection from local law enforcement, per CNN. In a statement, Bass called
  the revocation as “another act of revenge following a long list of political
  retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and
  more”. “This puts the former vice-president in danger and I look forward to
  working with the Governor to make sure Vice-President Harris is safe in Los
  Angeles,” Bass said. The revocation comes as Harris prepares to launch a
  national book tour promoting her new memoir, 107 Days, which details her
  presidential campaign. The book is scheduled for release on 23 September.
