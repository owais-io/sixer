  Don’t talk about the Ashes. Don’t talk about the Ashes. Don’t. Talk. About the
  Ashes. OK. We can talk about the Ashes. But just for a bit, and only in the
  context of some quietly vital events in the opening session at a green and
  swampy Oval on the second day of this fifth Test. Two things happened here
  that will have nudged the dial, not just in this match, but before Perth in
  November and England’s next one. The second of these was an hour of revivalist
  Bazball as Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley produced a wonderfully breezy 92-run
  opening stand in reply to India’s 224. This was back to the source. It was
  Ur-Bazball, Bazball Classic, Mexican Bazball with genuine cane sugar – really
  the best Bazball, from some very handsome Bazball guys. The fifty opening
  stand from seven overs was the fastest for England in the first innings of a
  Test. Early on Duckett took 24 off nine balls, including an outstanding
  example of the Hedgehog Sweep, bunching his quills into a ball, rolling over,
  whirling his bat past his left shoulder. Crawley kept battering the ball
  through the offside with such noble and soldierly command you half expected to
  look down and notice he was batting in epaulettes and a plumed hat. It felt
  like a Baz-manifesto statement at exactly the right moment, timed to disrupt
  lengths on a line and length pitch. And for a Stokes-free England a sense, as
  the ball fizzed to all corners, of Stokes being utterly present, a giant head
  in the sky above the red brick pavilion, beard massive, eyes blazing. The
  second and more vital of the two vital things came immediately before this, as
  Gus Atkinson did an important thing without really seeming to do an important
  thing. He did so brusquely and methodically as ever, marking a pencil point,
  inserting a rawlplug of appropriate gauge and putting a first firm screw in
  the wall, the obvious key peg in England’s attack come November in Perth.
  Atkinson was his usual bashful self as he raised the ball to the stands on his
  home ground after completing five for 33 to close India’s innings. He has that
  studied anonymity, the look of the forgotten sixth member of a boyband, now
  grudgingly back for the reunion tour. But he made a decisive statement here,
  and at a key moment. It is easy to lose sight of the fact England don’t really
  have a hypothetical first choice bowling attack right now. Who have we got
  then? What’s the check-board? Archer: yes, hopefully fit. Wood: yes, who
  knows. Woakes: crocked. Tongue: fit, raw. Carse: fit, decent. Cook: don’t
  think so. Potts: hmm. Overton: no. And outside of this, who knows? Another
  Overton? Sonny Baker? Eddie Jack? Jack Eddie? Promising Yorkshire quick Dougal
  Cakebread? At the end of day two at the Oval England do now have the only
  actual double tick. Atkinson: yes, fit and ready. And to be fair it probably
  was always Atkinson and four others. But was it really? Why was he playing
  club cricket? Why is he suddenly in Surrey Twos? What are the whispers about
  endurance, fatigue, dipping pace? Is Atkinson actually good? Is this thing for
  real? The five-for here was confirmation, first of that stellar early record,
  and second, just in the eye test. Atkinson looked so much better than everyone
  else here, all clean lines, simple, easy action, the whip in his delivery, the
  flick of the wrist. His pace was up at 88mph at times. Of his wickets Dhruv
  Jurel was a good, Aussie-facing one, a hard edge from bounce not lateral
  movement that flew thrillingly high to Harry Brook. And yes, Australia isn’t
  really a thing you can masterplan, despite the fact England always try. Well,
  we need tall, very quick, hit-the-deck bowlers who can go all day. Good luck
  with that. We remember Boyd Rankin flailing about like a wounded wampa in
  Sydney in 2010. He was tall. Atkinson is more from the 2010 metronomic plus
  decent pace template. Although the real key to that series was that Australia
  weren’t very good. For the second day in a row Atkinson found a lovely rhythm
  early on. He had Washington Sundar caught hooking at an 87mph bouncer. He
  padded the numbers with two in an over at the end, bowled and nicked off,
  having promised to go straighter. But it was well deserved having provided the
  only element of control on day one. He looked like a leader too. It is easy to
  forget how good his start has been, and how hard this is to do after just 21
  non-Test first class games to date. His method looks transferable. He has
  skills, can bowl a yorker, can, crucially, seam the ball away from the right
  hander, a function perhaps of how high his arm is at point of delivery.
  Atkinson may lack the star power and extreme early-spell speed of Jofra
  Archer. But he also has the Test record Archer was meant to have by now. Late
  in the day India kicked off their second innings 23 runs in arrears. Josh
  Tongue made the first breakthrough before Atkinson trapped Sai Sudharsan lbw
  to add to his tally. He has laid down his marker.
