  The notion of Salford walking out on Friday night to play their game against
  Leigh may seem to casual observers like a positive step, given they failed to
  fulfil their recent fixture against Wakefield and seem engulfed in a
  perma-crisis. In hindsight, the Salford warning signs were there last winter
  when the club requested an advance of £500,000 on their central distribution
  to survive the off-season. “We should have seen the wolves were at the door
  then,” one Super League chief executive said this week. A long-awaited
  takeover, led by the businessman Dario Berta in February, was supposed to end
  the uncertainty. If anything, it has only worsened it. Staff have routinely
  been paid late and Salford have had to let the majority of their first-team
  squad leave to stay afloat. They will rely predominantly on a squad of
  youngsters and loan players borrowed from other Super League clubs to get
  through to the end of the season. Their owners have not done a single public
  interview since arriving despite countless requests. That is only the tip of
  the iceberg. The takeover involved acquiring Salford Community Stadium and
  surrounding land. Clearing the club’s debts and stabilising it was part of the
  deal. So, when Salford city council walked away from a deal to sell the
  stadium to the club this summer, it left them in greater limbo than ever.
  Salford’s away support, among the best in Super League in recent years, has
  also been decimated – perhaps unsurprisingly given what they have been put
  through this season. But the couple of hundred who were at Leigh on Friday
  night certainly made themselves heard, with songs against the ownership group
  pre-match. On the field, their patched-up squad, which included nine loanees
  and some signed on the day of the game, did not disgrace themselves. They
  actually led Leigh at one stage here but you always felt that Leigh would
  eventually pull clear given their experience. That proved to be the case, with
  the Leopards winning 38-6 but Salford’s owners should look at how their
  players performed and be inspired to take action and save this famous club.
  Salford’s owners have promised for months that a multi-million pound bridging
  loan will arrive, which may tempt the council back into stadium talks, but it
  is nowhere to be seen. The Guardian has been told that Saia Kailahi and Curtis
  Brown, the two members of the consortium running the Red Devils day to day,
  are seriously considering stepping away in the near future. This is a club who
  finished fourth in Super League last year but, on the pitch, they are
  unrecognisable. All their best players have left for other clubs and insiders
  have insisted there are non-playing staff now considering doing the same,
  their wellbeing undone by continued uncertainty over whether they will be paid
  on time, or even at all. The situation will reach a head in the next
  fortnight. Salford have been using payday loan companies to meet the payroll.
  Debts are now understood to be in excess of £3m. The crucial bridging loan has
  been promised by the owners for months but now it simply has to arrive. If it
  does, then the projected plan is for Kailahi and Brown to move aside and bring
  in someone new to run the club. Salford staved off the threat of a winding-up
  order from HMRC earlier this year but they are in court again on 3 September
  when that petition will be heard. They also have another payroll to meet next
  week for August. Without that promised loan arriving and giving the Red Devils
  breathing space, things will take a turn for the worse. Political pressure is
  brewing too. A supporters’ group has been formed, with a protest taking place
  last Sunday despite the Wakefield game being off. Another will take place at
  their next home game. That group met the owners this week, and the mayor of
  Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, is also determined to do the same to
  understand what happens next. A push to remove the owners is not
  inconceivable. But there is a general acceptance among staff at the Red Devils
  that their time in Super League is drawing to a close for now, even if those
  long-awaited financial promises do materialise. IMG’s gradings system – in
  which Salford were ranked 12th last year – will determine 12 of the 14 clubs
  that play in Super League in 2026, with the other two chosen by an independent
  panel. Privately, Salford expect to be outside the top 12 this year. They will
  be deducted points in their IMG ranking thanks to at least one breach of the
  Rugby Football League’s operational rules, and with Championship sides
  including York and Toulouse set to dramatically increase their score, it will
  leave Salford at the mercy of that aforementioned panel. The problem? The
  criteria for election to Super League will revolve heavily around long-term
  financial stability and detailed forecasts. The Red Devils will apply to be
  part of the process, the Guardian has been told, but there is an acceptance
  they have next to no chance of being considered. So it is likely life next
  season will be in the Championship, and that is the best-case scenario. The
  alternative is almost unthinkable, 150 years of history disappearing. Salford
  will continue to fulfil their games, as the sport scrambles them through to
  the end of this campaign to avoid a logistical and reputational disaster. But
  the real story, the future facing the club, is now only days away from
  becoming clear.
