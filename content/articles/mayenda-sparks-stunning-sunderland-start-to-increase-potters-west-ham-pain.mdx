  Advertising hoardings dotted around Sunderland are adorned with enticing
  images of long sandy beaches and invite visitors to embark on adventures in
  “our city by the sea”. It is all part of an £80m project intended to reinvent
  and regenerate the post-industrial riverside area around the Stadium of Light
  but West Ham had evidently not bargained for this rejuvenation extending to
  the football team. As the second half unfolded, an exhilarating afternoon that
  exceeded the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic Sunderland fans became
  not so much an adventure as an ordeal by the North Sea for West Ham’s manager.
  “Disappointed with that,” said Graham Potter. “We have to learn the lesson
  that it’s difficult to win matches. It’s one game but we have to bounce back.
  We have to be better. We have to make it happen.” In marked contrast, Régis Le
  Bris looked as if he was struggling to stop smiling. “I’m happy for the fans,”
  he said. “We just have to enjoy this. West Ham are a strong team who maybe
  didn’t play their best football today.” Right from the start a
  counterattacking Sunderland, featuring seven summer signings, looked quick,
  agile and nimble-footed. While an array of new faces including the excellent
  Habib Diarra and Granit Xhaka shone, it was three of the old boys, Eliezer
  Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor, who scored the goals. Although West
  Ham, with Jarrod Bowen looking dangerous, held their own in the opening half
  they were restricted to two chances. Then, in the course of a chastening
  second period featuring some assiduous man-to-man marking, the visitors
  folded. They had perhaps failed to heed the warning delivered when Diarra, the
  club-record £30m midfield recruit from Strasbourg, showed off an impressive
  change of first-half pace as he executed a slick one-two with Mayenda. The
  heart of defence was pierced and only a decent save from Mads Hermansen kept
  the score goalless. For all Diarra’s fleet-footed probing, Noah Sadiki’s
  snappy tackling and the way the deep-sitting Xhaka showed why Bayer Leverkusen
  were so reluctant to part with him, West Ham were still not exactly out of
  things. It took a sliding, last-ditch clearance on Ballard’s part to prevent
  El Hadji Malick Diouf shooting the visitors ahead. One of football’s little
  mysteries revolves around the failure of one of the so-called “elite” clubs to
  poach Bowen. Goodness knows where West Ham would be without him. Robin Roefs,
  Sunderland’s new Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper, who was preferred to the
  playoff hero Anthony Patterson, showed off some nifty footwork and had not
  been overexerted. Nordi Mukiele must have felt reassured he was making the
  right choice in swapping Paris Saint-Germain for Sunderland. That move is
  poised to be confirmed on Saturday with the full-back becoming summer signing
  No 12. Simon Adingra, the former Brighton winger, and Diarra nearly give
  Sunderland the lead before Mayenda almost lifted the stadium’s roof off. When
  Omar Alderete, the Paraguay centre-half making his home debut as a substitute,
  hooked a cross into the area, Mayenda, a scorer at Wembley in May, backed into
  his marker before contorting his body into a position from where he headed
  Sunderland into the lead. If Potter looked unhappy with that piece of
  defending he appeared furious as the unattended Ballard guided a tremendous
  header beyond Hermansen after meeting Adingra’s deep cross. Hermansen will not
  want to watch replays of the third goal, curled in superbly by the substitute
  Isidor who, having connected with Xhaka’s delivery, ran at the defence before
  unleashing an effort that seemed to go through the former Leicester goalkeeper
  en route to the far corner. Given that this particular Sunderland side had
  never played together before it is small wonder Wearsiders are convinced Le
  Bris really is a special one.
