  A rise in taxation at the autumn budget looks inevitable, as Rachel Reeves
  grapples with £40bn hole in the public finances. That figure comes from a
  recent report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
  (NIESR), which blames the deficit on higher-than-expected borrowing levels and
  a weaker growth outlook for the UK economy. The question now facing the
  chancellor is: who should pay more? A growing chorus of voices across the
  Labour party say a wealth tax is the answer. So how would a wealth tax work?
  Politicians from across the divide have the habit of talking about wealth
  taxes in vague terms, often perpetuating misconceptions. Here’s a visual
  breakdown of the key elements of a wealth tax system. The analysis uses
  figures from the most in-depth study of a potential UK wealth tax so far,
  produced in 2020 by the Wealth Tax Commission, a panel of leading economists
  assembled by tax experts Arun Advani, Emma Chamberlain and Andy Summers.
  Summers, director of CenTax and co-author of the 2020 study, said: “Given the
  limited information HMRC currently hold on wealth, a wealth tax would be
  difficult to deliver any time soon. A better way to raise money from wealth
  would be to reform Capital Gains Tax (CGT). This is not just about raising
  rates. The Government should introduce an investment allowance and close gaps
  that currently allow some business gains to go completely untaxed. Doing this
  would be good for investment and growth, and raise over £13bn annually by the
  end of the Parliament.” The Institute of Fiscal Studies has similarly argued
  that an annual wealth tax would be a “poor substitute for properly taxing the
  sources and uses of wealth”. Treasury officials are understood to favour the
  latter. Critics say a wealth tax would be too difficult and costly to
  implement, and that wealthy individuals would be able to move their holdings
  or to simply leave the country. They point to countries such as Austria,
  Denmark and Germany’s decision to scrap similar taxes in the past. However,
  other countries including Spain and Switzerland have been successfully using
  wealth taxes to raise significant sums for generations. In their letter to the
  government the economists in favour of a wealth tax argue that the UK can
  overcome these difficulties – by leveraging digital technology and studying
  previous attempts to tax wealth – and pioneer a progressive tax system “fit
  for the 21st century”. Sources and methodology Tax revenue figures for income
  tax freeze, national insurance rise and pension contribution relief are taken
  from NIESR. The figures for capital gains equalisation are taken from the
  Centre for the Analysis of Taxation. Wealth distribution by asset class data
  is taken from the ONS Survey of Personal Incomes 2022-2023. UK Wealth
  inequality data and figures on UK total wealth ownership are from 2023 and are
  provided by the Wealth Inequality Lab. Wealth tax model and figures are from
  the Wealth Tax Commission (WTC) report and their 2020 tax simulator (the WTC
  study input figures are from 2018). The Guardian uprated the WTC figures by a
  nominal GDP increase of 39.13% between 2018 and 2025. 2018 GDP figures are
  from the ONS, while 2025 GDP figures are from the OBR. Figure adjustments by
  nominal GDP are rough estimates, conducted by the Guardian in consultation
  with the original researchers.
