  Samuel Pepys’s diary, which covers 1660 to 1669, is regarded as one of the
  great classic texts in the English language. Words spill out of Pepys – 1.25m
  of them – as he bustles around London, building a successful career as a naval
  administrator while navigating the double trauma of the plague and the Great
  Fire of London. Historians have long gone to the diary for details of
  middle-class life during the mid‑17th century: the seamy streets, the
  watermen, the taverns and, as Pepys moves up the greasy pole, the court and
  the king. Best of all is his eye for the picturesque detail: the way, for
  instance, on the morning of 4 September 1666, as fire licks around his house,
  Pepys buries a choice parmesan cheese in the garden with the intention of
  keeping it safe. Not all of the diary is in English, though. Quite a lot of it
  is in French (or rather Franglais), Latin, Spanish and a curious mashup of all
  three. Pepys increasingly resorted to this home-brewed polyglot whenever the
  subject of sex came up, which was often. Indeed, sex – chasing it, having it,
  worrying about getting it again – dominated Pepys’s waking life and haunted
  his dreams, many of them nightmares. Putting these anguished passages in a
  garbled form not only lessened the chance of servants snooping, but also
  served to protect him from his own abiding sense of shame. As an extra layer
  of concealment, Pepys wrote “my Journall” using tachygraphy, an early form of
  shorthand. Pepys’s diaries were published in bowdlerised form in the 19th
  century, and it was not until the 1970s that they became available in 11
  unexpurgated volumes. Even then, explains Guy de la Bédoyère, there were many
  transcription errors and, crucially, no attempt was made to translate the
  coded passages into English. Historians knew about them, of course, not least
  because all you needed was a bit of classroom French and Latin to work out
  their meaning. On 25 March 1668, Pepys records that he has given “Mrs Daniels”
  eight pairs of gloves “for tocar my prick con her hand”, which is hardly
  likely to keep anyone guessing for very long. All the same, it has been easy
  to lose sight of the sexual thread of Pepys’s diary amid all the chatter about
  navy ships and expensive cheese. Which is why, for the first time, De la
  Bédoyère has gone back to the original manuscript and translated all of
  Pepys’s coded entries, publishing them end-to-end with only a minimum of
  contextual information. The result is an extraordinarily detailed snapshot of
  life seen through the eyes of a man for whom no day was complete unless he had
  managed to fondle at least one woman’s “mameles” (breasts) on his way to or
  from work. In the past, people have blamed Pepys’s bad behaviour on the
  Restoration. These were the years when the dour pieties of Oliver Cromwell had
  been replaced by Charles II’s permissive libertarianism. But there is much
  more – and much worse – to the occluded parts of Pepys’s diary than mere
  bawdiness. On 3 February 1664, for example, he is travelling in a carriage
  down Ludgate Hill when he witnesses three men raping a woman and wishes he
  could join in. On 1 December 1660, he beats his maid Jane savagely with a
  broom, though it is clear that he is eyeing her up for a future assignation.
  He often uses the words “towsing” and “tumbling” to describe what he is doing
  with women which sounds jolly and bucolic until De la Bédoyère explains that
  these terms are euphemisms for violence. The only occasion on which Pepys
  might hold back was if he knew a woman was single, which would make any
  pregnancy impossible to explain away. (It was a mercy that he didn’t realise
  that an earlier operation for a bladder stone had probably left him sterile.)
  For that reason, he badgered any girl he wanted to sleep with regularly to get
  married, so he could carry on regardless. As news of his behaviour got around,
  so others would try to exploit it. On 11 August 1665, an old waterman called
  Delkes presented Pepys with his daughter-in-law, who was willing to sleep with
  him in return for a guarantee that her husband would not be pressed into naval
  service. And then there was his marriage. Pepys had wed Elizabeth when she was
  just 14. He was proud of her beauty, congratulating himself on how much
  prettier she was than the many grand ladies at court whom he encountered on
  his way to becoming secretary to the navy. Everything else about her
  frustrated him. He grumbled about her untidiness, extravagance, moodiness and
  the fact that her heavy periods and a recurrent labial abscess meant that she
  often wasn’t available for sex. Most of all, he resented the way that she had
  taken to hiring plain maidservants in the hope that he would leave them alone
  (it didn’t work). Inevitably he took out his frustrations with his fists: on
  19 December 1664 he gave Elizabeth such a black eye that she was unable to go
  to church on Christmas Day for fear of what the neighbours would think. While
  Pepys’s dark side has long been known, it is something else to be confronted
  with the evidence laid out quite so starkly. The man who emerges from De la
  Bédoyère’s meticulous filleting is no Restoration roustabout but a chilling
  embodiment of male entitlement. This newly explicit view of Pepys does not
  negate the continuing value of his diary – which remains a magnificent
  historical resource – but from now on it will be impossible to go to it in a
  state of innocence, let alone denial. • The Confessions of Samuel Pepys: His
  Private Revelations by Guy de la Bédoyère is published by Abacus (£25). To
