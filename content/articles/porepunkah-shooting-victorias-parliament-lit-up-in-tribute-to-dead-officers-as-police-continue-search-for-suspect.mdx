  Who is Dezi Freeman? In case you missed it, our reporters have been finding
  out more about Dezi Freeman, his life on the sprawling rural property on the
  edge of the town, and what might have forged his apparent anti-authority
  beliefs. Good morning, Nick Visser here to take over the liveblog. I’ll be
  bringing you updates throughout the morning. Jacinta Allan pays tribute to
  dead police officers Victoria’s premier, Jacinta Allan, announced that
  prominent Melbourne buildings would be lit up in tribute to the dead police
  officers. She expressed her deepest sympathies to the the family, friends and
  colleagues of the two officers. She said: It’s a very physical way that we can
  say to the men and women of Victoria police, we stand with you, we support
  you, we care for you, we love you, particularly in this time of grief. In
  Wangaratta, down the road from Porepunkah, people have decorated the foyer of
  the town’s police station with bouquets of flowers in memory of the fallen
  policemen. As the search for Freeman nears the 48-hour mark, our reporters
  have been reporting from the scene in Porepunkah. The normally quiet, idyllic
  Victorian high country town has become the focus of national attention with
  helicopters buzzing overhead and police officers swarming the local bushland.
  One local who knew Dezi Freeman told us that the fugitive was a “new age Ned
  Kelly” who would be “pretty handy in the bush” even with up to a metre of snow
  forecast for the region over the next three days. Another said: “It’s not some
  conspiracy theorist town. What’s happened – in any place [it would be] so far
  out of the ordinary. So it’s quite surreal really.” Read the whole article
  here: Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the hunt for the
  Porepunkah shooting suspect, Dezi Freeman. The search goes into its third day
  today with police still camped in the small Victorian high country town to
  search bushland around the property where detective leading senior constable
  Neal Thompson, 59, and senior constable Vadim De Waart, 35, were allegedly
  killed by Dezi Freeman on Tuesday morning. We’ll have the latest on the search
  in a moment. Victoria’s Parliament House has been lit up in blue in tribute to
  the dead officers with state premier, Jacinta Allan, saying it was a way of
  paying physical tribute to the men. More coming up.
