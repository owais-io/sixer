  A bishop who went on stage in a dressing gown and shut down a choir for making
  a “terrible racket” has apologised for the “distress and offence” he caused.
  Last Friday, Jonathan Baker, the bishop of Fulham, told a room of about 360
  people, including the City Academy Voices choir, to leave St Andrew church in
  Holborn, central London, as they neared the end of their special summer
  concert. They had just finished belting out the Supremes’ hit I’m Gonna Make
  You Love Me when the lights went out and Baker joined them on-stage. Dressed
  in a blue dressing gown and with bare feet, he took the mic, described the
  choir’s singing as a “terrible racket” and told them to get out. “You are in
  my house, can you leave it now please,” he said. In a video posted on social
  media, the bishop can be seen telling the choir it is past 10pm and calls for
  the night to be “over”. On Wednesday, Baker issued a written apology to “all
  the members of the City Academy Choir”, which was seen by the Guardian, for
  bringing the concert to a “premature end”. “I write to apologise for the
  distress and offence which I caused on Friday evening in bringing the City
  Voices concert to a premature end. This should not have happened, I take full
  responsibility and apologise unreservedly,” he said. “I also apologise for
  remarks which were made in haste and which have understandably caused hurt and
  distress.” St Andrew church is available to hire as an events venue. The choir
  had booked the space until 11pm but Baker appeared shortly after 10pm.
  Addressing this, Baker said: “I accept that you had made a booking for the
  site until 11pm. My understanding that the performance would cease at 10pm was
  mistaken and I apologise for this too. “I have lived here on site at St
  Andrew’s for 10 years, for much of which City Academy has rehearsed and
  performed here. You have been, and continue to be, welcome and I hope that you
  will be able to continue the relationship with us. “I can give you every
  assurance that the events of Friday evening will not recur and I apologise
  again to performers (especially those unable to perform at the end of the
  evening) and audience alike.” Among those denied a finale was Raj Swamy, 33.
  He was getting ready to sing his solo, Reach Out I’ll Be There, when he
  noticed the bishop opening the door behind him and switching off the lights.
  “It was an odd experience. It was just before I was about to sing. I never
  thought a bishop would be the reason I didn’t have a solo that night,” he told
  the Times. The final song on the choir’s setlist was going to be a fully
  staged rendition of Abba’s Dancing Queen. After Baker demanded everyone leave,
  outrage bubbled up and the choir began performing an a cappella version on
  stage, before finishing it on their way out to a loud, rapturous reception.
  Leigh Stanford Thompson, the director of the choir, called the incident
  “bizarre”. By chance, it was also his last concert in the role. “We had a
  really good concert but I think it’s a real shame that we didn’t get a chance
  to finish. But now looking back, what a way to go out,” he said.
