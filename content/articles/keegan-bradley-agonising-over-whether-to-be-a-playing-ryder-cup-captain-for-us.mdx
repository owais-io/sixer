  Keegan Bradley has opened up on the intense strain associated with his
  upcoming and “defining” decision on whether to play for, as well as captain,
  the United States in the Ryder Cup. “I am going to be really happy when this
  week is over,” Bradley said. “I have about had it with this whole thing. I am
  ready to figure out what we are doing and get a team together.” Bradley is due
  huge credit for his candour. A second round of 64 at the Tour Championship
  boosted his case to become the first Ryder Cup playing captain since Arnold
  Palmer in 1963. Bradley, who was 11th in the US rankings heading into the
  Atlanta event, will name his six wildcards on Wednesday. “I am very well aware
  that no matter what decision I make, I am going to be defined by it,” Bradley
  said. “If we win, it doesn’t matter what I do. I am fine with that, normally
  if you win you are the best captain and when you lose you are the worst. I
  have been a part of teams. “Every captain has to make tough decisions, this is
  just a unique one. It is going to be controversial either way but I am ready
  for it. This is the biggest decision of my life.” Bradley has also emphasised
  the big picture is uppermost in his thoughts. The US are seeking to regain the
  trophy they lost in Rome two years ago. “I really don’t care if I play and
  lose all five matches or if I don’t play,” said the 39-year-old. “As long as
  we win on Sunday. Any decision we make is with that in mind. This is about
  what we think will win us the Ryder Cup.” Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa
  are almost certain to take two of Bradley’s selections for the tournament from
  26-28 September. Both were in attendance as the US held a Ryder Cup team
  dinner in Atlanta on Tuesday. Patrick Cantlay’s involvement at Bethpage is
  also highly likely. Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Sam Burns and Maverick McNealy
  are the others who are part of the discussion alongside Bradley himself.
  Griffin’s chances are the strongest among that set. Bradley’s six-under-par
  second round came despite huge distraction. “It is very difficult,” he added.
  “I am having a really hard time right now separating my captaincy and my play.
  For the past month it has been like this. This week I am trying so hard [to
  focus] but it [the Ryder Cup] is all I am thinking about. Pairings, certain
  things I want to say to the guys during the week … it is just difficult. “I
  have been in the position before of trying to make the team, it is just really
  strange being the captain. I don’t think anyone has ever gone through this.”
  It therefore seems to naturally follow that playing at the same time as
  leading the team would add a fresh level of stress. “ It would be difficult,”
  said Bradley. “It is doable though. I have got incredible vice-captains and
  people to lean on. I will cross that bridge if it comes.” Umpteen players have
  been adamant Bradley’s ability and form mean he should play. The man himself
  insisted that need not be altogether relevant. “It means a lot but I don’t
  think it counts,” Bradley said. “We have to get together with vice-captains
  and look at what has gone on, look at the data and make a decision based on
  what is best for the team. That stuff certainly feels nice for me but when we
  look at me as a player, we talk as if I am not in the room. We look at the
  stats, the data and I am player X. That is strange but if there are negatives
  about me playing, I want to hear those. “I feel like I am still one of the
  best players in the world so I figured the likelihood of me being completely
  out of the picture was slim. I had an inkling so we have been preparing for
  this. It certainly would be a lot easier if I was top six or completely out of
  it.” Tommy Fleetwood’s latest bid for an overdue victory on American soil has
  him tied for the lead with Russell Henley at the halfway point at East Lake.
  Fleetwood’s 63 and Henley’s 66 left the pair at 13 under. Young is two strokes
  back, with Cantlay alongside Robert MacIntyre at minus 10. “I actually feel
  like I’ve played very, very well when I have led tournaments and been in
  contention,” Fleetwood said. “It’s just I might have not got things right at
  the end. It’s not like I’ve crashed and burned. It’s just that I’ve not quite
  finished things off. “The people that win the most are the guys that are in
  contention the most. That’s just what I want to do. That’s where I want to be.
  I love the buzz when I am in contention.”
