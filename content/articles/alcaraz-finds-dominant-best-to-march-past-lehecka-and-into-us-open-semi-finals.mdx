  It took just seven minutes for Carlos Alcaraz to recognise that he was having
  another one of those days where he could do whatever he wanted with a tennis
  ball. Up a game point in his opening service game, the Spaniard skipped around
  the ball from far behind the baseline in his backhand corner and attempted the
  riskiest shot possible, unleashing a remarkable forehand winner. This would
  not be the last time that the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd collectively gasped at
  Alcaraz’s greatness as he continued to radiate confidence and calm in New
  York, moving effortlessly into the semi‑finals with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win
  against Jiri Lehecka. This tournament has further underscored the ease and
  confidence surrounding Alcaraz’s tennis. Having reached the finals of his past
  seven tournaments while leading the tour with 59 match wins and six titles,
  this is the most consistent stretch of the 22-year-old’s career and he has
  played with total freedom over the past 10 days. He has now reached a grand
  slam semi-final without dropping a set for the first time in his career.
  Still, Alcaraz began the match fully conscious of the fact that Lehecka
  represented his toughest opponent so far and things could be different. The
  talented 23-year-old has been on the verge of breaking through for some time.
  He is armed with a powerful first serve and a destructive forehand. At the
  Qatar Open in February, the Czech toppled Alcaraz in three sets. This time,
  Alcaraz set the tone immediately by breaking Lehecka’s serve in the opening
  game. Across nearly two hours, he never let up. Alcaraz served spectacularly
  well, marching through his service games, his variety of shot starkly
  contrasted with Lehecka’s one-note attack. His defence made the court seem so
  narrow for his challenger. After two convincing sets, where Alcaraz broke in
  the opening service game and never looked back, the third set particularly
  demonstrated his growth. Lehecka played his best set of the match, moving
  through his own service games and putting pressure on Alcaraz. In the past,
  Alcaraz may have lost focus and found himself tussling wih both his opponent
  and himself. On this occasion, the moment the Lehecka began to show nerves, he
  pounced. At 4-4, instead of searching for a highlight-reel winner, Alcaraz
  locked down his game, making deep returns and offering up no free errors. He
  broke Lehecka’s serve with a spectacular defensive effort, celebrating with a
  roar. Even for Alcaraz, who continues to pile up big titles at a faster rate
  than anyone else in the world, his recent efficiency has been striking. He has
  always been prone to dramatic moments of self-sabotage. The next step in
  Alcaraz’s career was learning how to perform more consistently, allowing him
  to preserve his mental and physical energy for his biggest rivals. As he moves
  closer to a potential sixth grand slam title, his progress is undeniable.
