  Ukraine’s parliament has passed a law restoring independence to two
  anti-corruption bodies, essentially annulling another law adopted last week
  that prompted the biggest street protests since Russia’s full-scale invasion
  three years ago. Several hundred protesters outside the parliament building in
  Kyiv erupted into chants of “the people are the power” as the bill passed on
  Thursday lunchtime. “Unity is important in wartime, but even more important is
  remembering the values that our soldiers are defending on the frontline,” said
  Oleksandra, a 19-year-old economics student who said she had been to every
  protest since they began last week. “I’m happy that the government has
  listened to us.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hope the new law will put an end to
  what had threatened to become a political crisis domestically and had worried
  European allies, who warned him privately that the moves would be disastrous
  for Ukraine’s image as a democratic state. He signed the law into force
  swiftly after the vote. The law passed as Russia continued to bombard Ukraine
  with drones and missiles nightly. A huge attack on Kyiv overnight killed at
  least nine people, including a six-year-old child. One missile strike in the
  early hours of Thursday led to the partial collapse of a nine-story block of
  flats, and authorities reported that 124 people had been injured, including 10
  children. In another major attack on Monday night, Russian missile strikes
  killed more than 25 people, including at a prison and a maternity hospital in
  the east of Ukraine. Donald Trump appears to be taking a slightly tougher tone
  with Russia and earlier this week lowered a 50-day deadline for Russia to make
  progress on a ceasefire to “10 or 12 days”, saying he had not seen any serious
  desire from Vladimir Putin to end the war. On Thursday, the senior US diplomat
  John Kelley told the UN security council that Trump wanted the war ended by
  next Friday, though he gave little detail of why this effort was expected to
  succeed where previous attempts had failed. Before taking office Trump had
  promised to end the conflict within 24 hours. Kelley said: “Both Russia and
  Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a
  deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United
  States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace.” He did
  not specify what measures he had in mind. Zelenskyy called on Ukraine’s allies
  on Thursday to put further pressure on Moscow after the latest strikes on
  Kyiv. “Today the world once again saw Russia’s answer to our desire for peace
  with America and Europe … That is why peace without strength is impossible,”
  he wrote on Telegram. He also called for foreign leaders to push for regime
  change in Russia. “If the world doesn’t aim to change the regime in Russia,
  that means even after the war ends, Moscow will still try to destabilise
  neighbouring countries,” he said in a speech on Thursday to a conference
  marking 50 years since the signing of the cold war-era Helsinki accord.
  Overnight in Kyiv, explosions rang out for hours, making it another sleepless
  night for many before the parliamentary vote. Nonetheless, several hundred
  people gathered in a park close to parliament during the vote, the latest in a
  set of protests over the past week predominantly attended by young Ukrainians.
  The law passed with 331 votes in favour and none against, a rapid U-turn from
  the bill that passed the previous week with support from Zelenskyy’s Servant
  of the People party. That bill stripped powers from the national
  anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised anti-corruption
  prosecutor’s office, Sapo. Both work independently of other law enforcement
  bodies specifically to target high-level corruption. The changes would have
  brought them under the control of Zelenskyy’s handpicked general prosecutor.
  Oleksandr Klymenko, the head of Sapo, said on Wednesday that the two
  institutions have open investigations against 31 sitting MPs and said the move
  to bring Nabu and Sapo under control was probably caused by their
  investigations into powerful people. “The main thing about our work is the
  enormous preventive effect it has,” he said in a briefing at his office,
  claiming that the prospect of being caught meant fewer top officials risked
  engaging in corrupt activities. Zelenskyy announced late last week that he had
  listened to the criticism expressed during street protests and from various
  western officials and would table a new law. In an interview, Mykhailo
  Podolyak, a Zelenskyy aide, denied that introducing the original law was a
  “mistake”, and also denied that the bodies were targeted in retaliation for
  bringing cases against top-level officials. He said the government’s swift
  response had shown it listened to criticism. “The question is how you react if
  your initiatives are not accepted by people. Either you ignore protests and
  complaints, or you analyse them and then make corrections. President Zelenskyy
  has shown that he reacts very quickly to society and is ready to cooperate
  constructively,” Podolyak said. Thursday’s parliamentary session devoted to
  the law was televised for the first time since 2022, lifting a security ban on
  filming. Opposition MPs made fiery speeches criticising Zelenskyy and the
  presidential administration before the vote. When the results were announced,
  the crowd outside parliament broke into cheers and sang the national anthem.
  Protesters have been clear that they do not have revolutionary intentions,
  with most acutely aware of the dangers of political destabilisation in
  wartime. Instead, they say, the demonstrations show that Ukrainian democracy
  is functioning despite a lack of elections under martial law.
