  An investigation has been launched and a childcare educator has been stood
  down after a grandparent mistakenly picked up and took home the wrong toddler
  from a Sydney daycare centre. The grandfather arrived to collect his
  grandchild from First Steps Learning Academy in Bangor on Monday afternoon,
  only to reportedly be given the wrong child. The man unwittingly took the
  child, who was sleeping at the time, home with him. The mistake was only
  realised when the boy’s mother showed up at the centre to collect him and
  found he was not there, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. “I can’t explain
  the feeling,” the mother told the newspaper of learning her one-year-old had
  been collected by a man she didn’t know. “We don’t blame him. We are not angry
  with him. We are not upset at him – we blame the daycare.” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The grandfather’s wife told the Sydney Morning Herald her
  husband was “devastated” by the mistake and “raced [the] child back so fast”
  when he realised he had the wrong boy. “I am just so glad the little boy was
  OK,” she said, adding her husband had arrived at the centre when the children
  were sleeping and the room was dark. New South Wales’ Early Childhood
  Education and Care Regulatory Authority said it was conducting a “thorough
  investigation” into the “deeply concerning and serious incident”. The
  authority said an educator had been stood down by the daycare centre while the
  matter was investigated. “The … regulatory authority investigation will
  consider the service’s compliance history,” the regulator said, adding NSW
  police had been notified. NSW police said it did not have any record of a
  police investigation. Trisha Hastie, the approved provider of First Steps
  Learning Academy, issued an apology to the families for the distress caused by
  the incident – which she said was “isolated”. “This has never happened before
  at Bangor, or at any of our other centres,” Hastie said in a statement on
  Thursday. “While we have always maintained strict protocols for drop-off and
  pick-up, in this case, those processes were not followed correctly. The
  educator involved has been stood down. “We have acted immediately to
  strengthen our procedures and ensure this never happens again.” The incident
  comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the early childhood sector in
  Australia. There have been disturbing allegations of abuse and neglect of
  children across Australian childcare centres in recent months, leading to
  government reviews of the sector in both NSW and Victoria. A suite of
  legislative changes has been announced by state and federal governments, aimed
  at improving safety standards in the sector. There have been no allegations of
  abuse or neglect directed at First Steps Learning Academy in Bangor.
