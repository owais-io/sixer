  In a flurry of wings, the predator was off with its prize: a steaming pasty
  snatched from the hands of a day tripper from Birmingham. “What do you want me
  to do about it?” her unsympathetic husband said. “I can’t fly.” Such a scene
  has become an almost daily spectacle on the Scarborough seafront, said Amy
  Watson, a supervisor at the Fishpan restaurant, where hungry herring gulls
  lurk for their quarry. With the summer holidays in full swing, seaside
  authorities across England are grappling with an annual influx of
  chip-pinching gulls – and the surge of complaints. There were 220 reports of
  gull incidents on the Yorkshire coast, stretching from Whitby to Filey,
  between 2021 and June this year, according to figures from North Yorkshire
  council. Two-thirds of these related to “attacks” and “gull muggings”. For
  some, the birds are as entwined with the charm of the seaside as ice-cream and
  penny arcades. For others, they are a smelly menace. “Oh God! They’re
  horrible!” said Shirley Durham-Hughes, a volunteer at the North Yorks Art
  School shop and creative hub in Scarborough. Durham-Hughes, 69, lives and
  works in the town and says the gulls are to be tolerated, not treasured. “I
  like the sound – it’s part of living by the coast – but they are a pest. I
  think they’re pretty awful.” It may not be obvious from a walk down
  Scarborough promenade but herring gulls and kittiwakes – two of the species
  commonly known as seagulls – are at risk of extinction in Britain. A
  combination of overfishing, warmer seas and offshore windfarms have caused
  such a decline in their numbers that they are now “red listed” as birds of
  conservation concern. Yet in Scarborough and other towns, their flock is
  soaring. A yearly census shows the number of occupied kittiwake nests in the
  resort has risen from 1,527 in 2005 to 2,127 this year – a 39% increase. The
  most dramatic increase, though, has been among those setting up nests on
  hotels, shopfronts and other buildings: a 1,318% increase since 2005, when
  there were just 78 occupied urban nests compared to 1,106 this year, according
  to Scarborough Birders, whose figures are published by the British Trust for
  Ornithology. The number of herring gulls is more difficult to count, but North
  Yorkshire council said there had been a “perceived increase” in their number –
  and a rise in complaints. The main reason for the increase in urban areas is
  simple, said Nick Addey, the chair of Scarborough Birders: “People started
  feeding them.” He added: “It’s just a human thing but for gulls it’s an easy
  meal. And what they do at sea is they snatch.” Like many seaside authorities,
  North Yorkshire council is in a flap about how to deal with the gulls. A
  senior councillor vowed last year to combat the “seagull menace that is
  gripping our coastal communities”. The council tried “gull-proofing” their
  favourite haunts and removing nests from the 126-metre cliff bridge – an act
  criticised as “environmental vandalism” – and is now considering building
  artificial nests on the Grade II*-listed Grand hotel, home to the
  second-biggest kittiwake colony in Scarborough. An attempt to eject gulls from
  the cliff bridge using bird-repellant “fire gel” came unstuck when an elderly
  saboteur reportedly used a broomstick to dislodge the devices. Others have
  taken to more extreme measures. Kittiwake chicks have been impaled on
  razor-sharp spikes installed on the side of the Grand hotel. Others “have seen
  them with arrows through their head. People were firing crossbows at them,”
  said Toni Cher, 49, a worker at the North Yorks Art School. “They’re not
  everyone’s cup of tea but that’s awful.” Seafronts across England have signs
  warning tourists not to throw chips for gulls – but for many it is part of the
  day out. And younger gulls have learned that the easiest meal is often from
  humans rather than at sea. “It’s about education,” said Addey. “But is it too
  late?” Another reason seabirds are migrating inland is, simply, that hotels
  are more pleasant than cliffs. They are less exposed, closer to easy quarry,
  and away from predators at sea. The closure of a local landfill site, a
  favourite gull-lunching spot, is also thought to have contributed to their
  rise in the town. Eating chips on a bench at Scarborough’s south bay beach,
  one day tripper, Peter Ellis, shooed a persistent gull away from his
  five-year-old daughter, Katrina-Rose. “They’re an absolute pest,” said Ellis,
  51. “I don’t know what use they are to the ecosystem.” Even Addey, a gull
  ally, admits they have a PR problem. “I think leave them alone in the right
  areas,” he said. “But for their own sake, for their PR, it’s best that there
  is some gull-proofing.” • The subheading of this article was amended on 20
  August 2025. An earlier version said kittiwakes steal food from humans;
  however, these birds feed at sea. This has been removed.
