  A new wave of book bans has hit Florida school districts, with hundreds of
  titles being pulled from library and classroom shelves as the school year
  kicks off. The Republican-dominated state, which has already had the highest
  rate of book bans nationwide this year, is continuing to censor reading
  materials in schools, bowing to external pressures in an effort to avoid
  conflict and government retaliation. “This is an ideological campaign to erase
  LGBTQ+ lives and any honest discussion of sex, stripping libraries of
  resources and stories,” William Johnson, the director of PEN America’s Florida
  office, told the Guardian. “If censorship keeps spreading, silence won’t save
  us. Floridians must speak out now.” Book bans have been rising at a rapid rate
  across the US since 2021, but this latest wave comes after increased pressure
  from the state board of education in Florida. The board issued a harsh warning
  to the Hillsborough county school district in May, saying that if they didn’t
  remove “pornographic” titles from their library, formal legal action could
  ensue. More than 600 books were pulled as a result, and the process was
  expected to cost the district $350,000. The books taken off the school shelves
  included The Diary of Anne Frank and What Girls Are Made of by Elana K Arnold.
  None of them were under formal review by the district, and they hadn’t been
  flagged by local parents as potentially inappropriate. Parents with children
  in the school system even had the opportunity to opt their children out of a
  particular reading, without removing them from the class for everyone. PEN
  called the board of education’s mass removal in Hillsborough county a
  “state-driven censorship”, and concluded “it is a calculated effort to
  consolidate power through fear, to bypass legal precedent, and to silence
  diverse voices in Florida’s public schools,” in their press release. Fearing
  similar retribution, nine surrounding school districts have taken proactive
  measures, pulling books which they are worried could cause similar
  controversy. This includes Columbia, Escambia, Orange and Osceola, who have
  followed suit and quietly complied, probably to avoid similar state
  retaliation. “Censorship advocates are playing a long game, and making
  Hillsborough county public schools bend the knee is a huge win for them,” said
  Rachel Doyle, who goes by “Reads with Rachel” on social media. Doyle has two
  children in the Hillsborough school district system and is frustrated that
  they are being used as political pawns. She feels that her voice has been
  erased by far-right groups like Moms for Liberty and that parental rights
  groups do not have her kids’ best interests in mind. “I do not want or need a
  special interest group or a ‘concerned citizen’ opting out for me,” Doyle
  said. “Once Florida becomes a place where this is the norm entirely, other
  states will follow.” In Escambia county, one of the nine school districts that
  have taken books off their library shelves after the Hillsborough removal
  campaign, 400 titles have been removed without review. These include I Know
  Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, and Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt
  Vonnegut, a satirical anti-war novel centered around a prisoner of war in
  Dresden after the Allied bombings in the second world war. What is happening
  in Florida is part of a broader, nationwide censorship drive fueled by
  conservative backlash against teachings about race, gender and diversity.
  Unsurprisingly, red states on average have seen higher instances of banned
  reading materials, with Florida accounting for 4,561 cases of prohibited
  titles this year, spanning 33 school districts. These bans often target
  authors of color, female writers and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Books
  that educate about any of these experiences, or that document historical
  periods, are the recipients of frequent censorship attacks. Rob Sanders, the
  author of several acclaimed children’s books like Ruby Rose and Peaceful
  Fights for Equal Rights, and a former Hillsborough county educator, has seen
  many challenges to his books in Florida and beyond. “If we eliminate every
  book that tells a story that is different than the life experiences of an
  individual or a family, there will be no books left in the library,” Sanders
  said. “As an author, the best thing I can do for children is to keep writing
  books that tell the truth and that celebrate the wonderful diversity in our
  world.”
