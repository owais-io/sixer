  Football strips nowadays are big business. Especially for the not
  insignificant number of clubs flogging shirts for £85+ a pop. As sport and
  fashion become ever more intertwined – Jack Grealish as an ambassador for
  Gucci; Son Heung-min for Burberry; Kalvin Phillips in those massive Loewe
  boots – mainstream football’s interest with clothes has moved on from just
  David Beckham in a sarong. It is a state of affairs that former catwalk model
  Pep Guardiola no doubt appreciates. And, after a couple of years of subpar kit
  designs – running the gamut from insipid to truly horrifying – the 2025-26
  Premier League season has upped its sartorial game. All-black away strips and
  turquoise touches have proved popular; while manufacturers still insist on
  “taking inspiration” from home stadium architecture and surroundings. (The
  success of this varies immensely; but Everton, Leeds, and Burnley have all
  nailed it this time around.) No brand has let the side(s) down, but the Adidas
  designers have done especially well with a series of understated new strips.
  The smaller labels have also impressed. And it is pleasing to see the three
  returnees dressed up for the occasion. 2025-26 is due to be the final season
  that betting companies are allowed to serve as front-of-shirt sponsors, but
  judging by the number still present they will have to be dragged from the
  pitch kicking and screaming. Here are all the looks – taking in sand, sky, and
  sea – to soon emerge from the tunnel. Arsenal The Gunners launched their new
  home strip on a heavily vignetted, blood-red landing page, complete with
  anatomical heart beating on the screen; an incongruously dark vibe until you
  consider that Mikel Arteta does indeed have something of the night about him.
  A subtle repeating motif on the shirt is a similarly eldritch, gothic A (a nod
  to the typeface used for the club’s 1949-50 “Victoria Concordia Crescit”
  crest), offset by a crisp white collar and sleeve. Said sleeve is still urging
  us to Visit Rwanda. The away kit is also good: a royal blue lightning bolt-ish
  pattern that harks back to the mid-90s’ on-the-road design, and only mildly –
  unintentionally – reminds one of the Victoria line moquette. The beautiful,
  art deco-influenced third kit in cream and burgundy features the Adidas
  trefoil logo, AKA the one that looks like the top half of a ganja leaf. Apart
  from that, you would be happy to take it home to your mum. Do not ask me why
  Arsenal need five goalkeeper shirts, but you will find David Raya in any of
  the following (deep breath): green; a slightly darker green; yellow and red;
  yellow and black; purple. Aston Villa The sleeve of Villa’s Adidas home strip
  ostensibly “pays homage” to the club stadium. This seems to be a common – but
  too often shoddily executed – theme this year. But the Villans’ top actually
  does reference Villa Park in a way that is recognisable; the cuff features the
  same intricate gold design that adorns the Holte End facade. The main shirt
  colour way is the classic claret and blue; the shorts are white. The socks
  feature a gold “AV” monogram. The away fit is a mostly black design with grey
  raglan sleeve. It is OK, I guess; but it does slightly remind one of when the
  printer runs out of colour ink. Unlike the third kit, which is basically what
  would happen if a toddler was let loose with purple and blue finger-paints. A
  joy. As for the home goalkeeper jersey: you know when the doctor asks what
  colour phlegm you are bringing up, in case you have pneumonia? Usually
  indicated by an intense green? Well, it is not looking good for Emi Martínez
  (or his potential replacement) … Bournemouth There is no more awkward sponsor
  logo than the “bj88” slapped on the front of the Cherries’ shirts. It is
  difficult to see past such misfortune to assess the Umbro-made kit itself, but
  suffice to say it consists of black and red vertical stripes. In a hint at the
  club’s beachside location, there is a delightful “rippled sand” effect within
  the stripes. (And, for anyone fancying their chances with a metal detector
  along the coastline, the collar and cuff boast a gold trim.) The away strip is
  a throwback to the blue and black epoch – the Cherries if you’d packed them at
  the bottom of the shopping bag – with the crest and Umbro logo embroidered.
  Which is as it should be: I do not want to tell you how many TPU badges I have
  lost to bathroom radiators. The third kit is pastel pink. The home goalkeeper
  kit is a luminous green; the away a bright purple. Brentford Thomas Frank’s
  departure is not the only change for the Bees this year: their kit supplier,
  formerly Umbro, is now Joma. The Spanish brand has done well (what do you mean
  you have never heard of them? Do you not watch tennis players who rank in the
  low-tens?) The kit celebrates the centenary of the traditional red-and-white
  colour scheme with a breezy “100” signoff on the back of the collar (although
  it is giving “ran out of space at the bottom of the page” so the handwriting
  starts to slide into the margin). In keeping with the anniversary
  celebrations, the design echoes the 1925 strip; broad stripes with pinstripe
  edging. The collar is a modern take on the classic lace-up. Now, I do not know
  if there is a job-share situation going on at Joma, but while the home strip
  slaps, the away one is … well. The players will be running out in what I can
  only describe as a soil-brown monstrosity. (Maybe it is a literal grower.) The
  goalie outfit, meanwhile, is a bright pink number. The third kit is a little
  meh; a pale blue, salmon, and burgundy – hues borrowed from the club’s pre-red
  ‘n’ white era. Brighton Brighton’s new home strip is the first ever to feature
  the colour of “Hyper Turq”. This is because “Hyper Turq” is a colour Nike has
  made up. As the name suggests, it is turquoise. It is a nice touch (including
  on the Nike swoosh and underarm panels) on what can – apologies – historically
  be a pretty dull blue-and-white affair. Plus Hyper Turq turquoise is the
  colour of Brighton’s seafront railings. The smart v-shaped collar bears the
  quote: “WE ARE BRIGHTON”. The round-necked away kit is a lilac and mauve mix.
  Interestingly, both the Nike swoosh and crest are centrally aligned, which
  makes for a pleasingly streamlined aesthetic. In a rare example of club owners
  not trying to squeeze every last penny from loyal supporters, Brighton tend to
  repurpose the previous season’s away kit as the next third kit, which, at
  present, looks to be the case again (despite an earlier statement saying
  otherwise). The three keeper kits are in yellow, orange, and black. Nike did
  their best work this season in the “city by the sea” (embroidered on the
  back). Burnley Welcome back, lads. It is good to see you – especially because
  Castore has created some lovely new fits. The home shirt is in the traditional
  claret and features an ultra-fine topographical pattern representing the
  contours of Lancashire’s countryside and the heights of the Pennines. This
  actually works, unlike when manufactures “take inspiration” from something and
  then just whack on a standard, or unidentifiable, motif. The away shirt is sky
  blue and has a decoration resembling cirrus clouds (those are the streaky
  ones; yes, I did pay attention in GCSE geography – ask me about onion skin
  weathering, I beg you. Anyone) – although apparently they are meant to be
  sound waves. All in all it is a very soothing kit, as opposed to the multiple
  vibrant keeper strips, which strongly suggest attendance at the Holi festival.
  The third kit will be a much more hangover-friendly black with gold trim.
  Chelsea Dolly Parton once described her style as “costing a lot of money to
  look this cheap”; and it has to be said that the wealthier legacy clubs often
  seem to follow the same mantra. But Chelsea, celebrating their 120th
  anniversary, have scrubbed up well – if a little blandly – for the new season.
  Nike’s marketing spiel is that the jersey’s (extremely) subtle pattern
  “embodies the youthful spirit that has shaped west London”. Reggie Walsh – the
  club’s current 16-year-old squad member – will be pleased. They also managed
  to get Suggs in the promo video. Madness. The kit is the usual heritage colour
  of dark blue, but has red and white underarm inserts in a modern twist. The
  shirt will also boast a gold Club World Cup winners’ badge. As in recent
  seasons, a front-of-shirt sponsor is absent. The club is holding out for a
  lucrative long-term deal – although not signing a short one in the meantime
  does not seem to make a massive amount of business sense, IMHO. Shirts do look
  so much better without giant, garish logos though – especially when the logos
  are those of gambling companies. The home keeper shirt comes in black, and the
  away is green. The outfield away strip is much more interesting. Officially in
  the colours of “Phantom” (that’s white to you and me), and “Galactic Jade”
  (otherwise known as green) and red (red), the design is a nod to the club’s
  1974-75 Magnificent Magyars-era away look. There are also some centralised
  pinstripes to add flair. The third kit is yet to be released, but is rumoured
  to feature the 1990s club crest. Crystal Palace The Italian brand Macron is
  again producing the Eagles’ fits. The home, of course, features the classic
  red-and-blue vertical stripes, but this time the stripes include white bands
  in between them for a refined feel. The cuffs are also white – as are the
  sleek shoulder panels. It is a classy kit; far nicer than last season’s
  “experimental” effort which looked for all the world like an 80s pub carpet.
  The keeper kit is a light green. The away kit, complete with Mandarin collar,
  is a bold, gold affair to celebrate the club’s jubilant 2025 FA Cup win. The
  PR people are calling it the “Golden Eagle” kit, which is a pun I can 100% get
  behind. No update, at the time of writing, on the third look. Everton Despite
  the Toffees finishing unexpectedly rather well last season (given the
  inauspicious start, anyway); being reunited with beloved manager David Moyes;
  and moving into a brand new stadium, the club has struggled to secure quality
  additions during the transfer window. But should they materialise, the new
  signings will have the privilege of wearing an attractive and intelligent
  Castore strip. Both the body and sleeve of the home shirt – in a familiar
  Everton blue – feature a prominent wave pattern to represent the River Mersey
  and the club’s new waterfront ground. The socks, paired with white shorts,
  showcase the silhouette of local landmark, Prince Rupert’s Tower (also an
  integral part of the club crest). The away strip is a pale yellow for shirt
  and socks, with blue shorts. The cuff features a design that mirrors the
  railway line which used to serve Liverpool’s docklands. The third kit is
  rumoured to have a black base and Prince Rupert’s Tower on the chest instead
  of the club’s full badge. Meanwhile, Jordan Pickford will either be in a green
  jacquard number (home) or black (away). Fulham Fulham have announced their
  “clean and contemporary” 2025-26 home strip; and clean and contemporary is an
  accurate description of the v-necked, zero-red, all-white fit (with piping,
  Adidas logo, and the brand’s famous stripes on the shoulder all in black). The
  aesthetically agreeable home jersey also features a rubber emblem of Craven
  Cottage balcony’s wrought ironwork. Compensating for the white-domination of
  the outfield look, the keeper will wear all red with metallic detail. The away
  strip is also a looker, and heavily reminiscent of the club’s 1999-20 lime
  green away threads. It shows off an oversized retro collar and the club crest
  of the same era. Back in the day the club sponsor was an internet service
  provider called Demon Internet; a company which no longer exists, but turns
  out had a very prophetic name. No news yet on the third kit. Leeds United The
  Leeds Adidas-made home kit stays traditional with the main colourway of white,
  blue, and yellow. But, consistent with a popular concept in kit design this
  year, there is a cute pattern inspired by the mosaic tile of the Lowfields
  Tunnel – the route Whites fans often take to Elland Road – which adds pizzaz
  to what is otherwise a simple but gratifyingly polished, attractive look for
  the club’s return to the top tier. The away strip is predominantly blue with
  multiple yellow touches, including an all-yellow twist on sponsor Red Bull’s
  logo. The goalkeeper kits are in a lighter blue (home) and orange (away), as
  well as deep purple. The third kit is a few alcopops down; a dizzying, chaotic
  mishmash of the traditional three colours. But I rather like it; it is
  everything but dull. Liverpool Liverpool start their season dealing with a
  maelstrom of emotions. There is the triumph of last season’s title win and
  plenty of exciting new faces – Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong among them.
  But there is tragedy too: the death of Diogo Jota, as well as the incident at
  the title parade that left scores of fans injured. Joining Wirtz et al is
  another addition to the club: Adidas. The brand has signed a 10-year deal with
  the club after Liverpool ended their five-year Nike stint. And a brand
  responsible for some of the club’s most iconic strips has hit the ground
  running: the home outfit is an all-red affair (officially “Strawberry Red”)
  with a white crewneck collar and cuff. The simplified Liver Bird emblem
  remains instead of the full crest (which personally I wish would make a
  comeback …) The away effort is also beautiful: an off-white jersey
  complemented by red and dark green accents. The shirt is paired with a choice
  of either a black short and white sock, or the reverse. Meanwhile, the third
  kit is a mint green, which calls to mind the early 90s away drip. Manchester
  City Well done to Puma, who have designed a lovely home uniform here. It is
  the standard sky blue (with navy blue accents), but a sash features for the
  first time on a City home shirt (it has been a frequent away design element).
  The collar shade is the same as the body, creating a clean, smooth aesthetic.
  The away kit is an all-black number referencing the club’s earliest known
  strip. Either that or they are going through their Johnny Cash era/a severe
  depression. It is dashing, though, and if one were to attempt to enter a
  Michelin-starred restaurant in a footie top, this is the one I would probably
  go for (see also: a funeral). The third kit is causing quite the reaction
  online – none of it good. The neon green accents are proving especially
  unpopular, but for my money* the raindrops-inspired main design on a
  drizzly-grey jersey for a club located in the soggy north-west is a stroke of
  genius. LS Lowry would be proud. The goalie kits are available in many loud
  colourways, including fuchsia. *But not literally because YNWA. Manchester
  United The Red Devils have been promoting their new home strip with the
  strapline: “United, wherever we go.” Bold, given that the club has five
  players hankering for a move, all of whom are only allowed to train at
  Carrington after the rest of the squad has gone home. The Adidas kit
  ostensibly pays homage to Old Trafford – a slightly odd decision now that Jim
  Ratcliffe has announced the 115-year-old stadium is to be replaced with a
  Norman Foster-designed behemoth (currently assigned the Ronseal-esque name of
  “New Trafford”). The back of the collar reads “Theatre of Dreams” – if the
  dream is to finish 15th – while the sleeve incorporates an “abstract” pattern
  referencing the stadium. After close inspection, I can report that this is a
  very, very abstract reference indeed. The away kit is white with plum accents
  and a lavender snowflake motif inspired by the 1990-92 strip. The colour
  scheme brings to mind the Jenny Joseph couplet: “When I am old / I shall wear
  purple”; just a thought in case the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo fancies a
  hat-trick of United stretches. The third kit is the best of the three; a black
  and yellow strip reminiscent of the 1993-94 away kit. Newcastle United Despite
  the Magpies’ extremely feelgood Carabao Cup win last season – marking a first
  domestic triumph in 70 years for this storied and well-loved club – it still
  pains me somewhat to compliment a team majority-owned by a regime whose
  greatest hits include dismemberment by bone-saw. But kit manufacturer Adidas
  continues its (for the most part) good summer run here. Clubs with traditional
  monochrome colours can sometimes struggle to distinguish themselves, but
  Adidas has introduced a serrated edge to those classic, thick black stripes.
  The border pattern is officially known as Shepherds’ plaid, although it
  actually reminds me of frits (those little black dots at the bottom of
  windscreens). Other elements include blue piping and an “HOWAY THE LADS”
  inscription on the back of the collar. The away kit is not as much reminiscent
  of a Saudi national team kit as could quite literally be a Saudi national team
  kit of before. The third kit, in burnt orange and blue, is a fun number with a
  stitched crest; inspired by that incredible late 90s away piece. It has the
  Adidas trefoil logo to maximise the retro feel. The goalie garms come in
  yellow, blue, purple, and pink, respectively. Nottingham Forest Forest’s new
  home kit is a throwback to its favoured early 90s strip, sharing the same
  polo-style collar and a wide pinstripe body. It is an extremely classy affair
  from Adidas, with a nice added detail being the also 90s-inspired shield
  crest. The keeper will wear yellow, orange, or blue. When the club, after its
  successful last season, initially released the new home shirt it was yet to
  feature a front sponsor – and was all the more handsome for it. But now, just
  in time for the team’s opening game, it advertises … a betting company.
  Surprise, surprise. The away fit is primarily cream and features a neat
  detail: a weave replicating the lace designs the city is famous for. No third
  kit news at the time of writing. Sunderland Danish brand Hummel frequently
  punches above its weight, and this smart new effort for Sunderland’s return to
  the top flight is no different. But not everybody is happy: the back of the
  players’ home shirt (but not the fan replica) is catching flak from supporters
  for the number placement – a white panel has been introduced to abide by
  Premier League legibility rules. The rest of the shirt is an elegant creation;
  a black v-neck with thin bands of the traditional red-and-white is a key
  characteristic. Also eye-catching is the crest placement; centrally aligned
  for the first time since the 1990s. And why shouldn’t the Black Cats show it
  off when it is one of the prettiest around? In a similar move to Leeds,
  Sunderland’s snazzy goalie kits allude to the patterned tiles of a city
  landmark (in this case, the Bridge Hotel); while the gorgeously retro
  royal-blue away outfield threads are further livened by a chequerboard weave
  with a subtle Roker Beach lighthouse motif. The third kit is an all-black
  number because: Black Cats, geddit? Tottenham Hotspur Spurs’s home kits have
  been rather banal and indistinguishable for a while now (sorry), but Nike has
  come up with something a little fresher this time for the Europa League
  holders (although that is no consolation for the departing Son). As with
  Sunderland, the new Spurs home shirt has a centrally aligned brand logo and
  club badge. The sleeve and underarm panels incorporate “Iron Ore” as an accent
  colour (Nike is at it again; they are grey), which is a departure, and ribbing
  on the body provides texture. Fans and players will also be wearing navy
  shorts with white socks. It is definitely the club’s least insipid home strip
  for a long time – although it retains a slight whiff of the training ground.
  More rousing is the luminous pink-and purple-gradient pinstripe keeper’s kit.
  The Lilywhites go all black with their away look – a prevalent choice this
  upcoming season. The Spurs kit in particular reminds one of Roger Federer’s
  iconic 2007 US Open drip. Nike’s blurb describes it as “razor-sharp,
  engineered for speed and built for stealth”, which unfortunately does sound a
  lot like club legend Harry Kane in his prime. The away keeper’s kit is akin to
  the home one but in mint-and-forest green. The third kit is yet to be
  officially launched, but it looks as though the bright yellow and navy shirt
  will air the beautiful 90s-era crest. West Ham Umbro has gone back to basics
  for the Hammers’ fetching new home strip. The traditional claret colour is the
  majority presence, but it is the dapper taping detail on the ribbed collar and
  cuff – and discreet underarm blue inserts (the colour is relegated to a
  smaller role than usual) – that subtly elevate this minimalist take. The
  applique full club crest is revived here after last season’s hideous variation
  and the crossed-hammers symbol is also printed on the back of the neck. The
  socks and shorts are in white. The away strip is equally nice and calm.
  Supposedly it is a callback to the 1996-97 away strip; I would argue that the
  call is not particularly loud. But it is a satisfyingly soft, creamy ecru with
  black sleeves and collar. The third kit, with a fold-over collar and a
  striking oversized Hammers logo on the breast, is a mix of submarine-deep navy
  as well as gold. Where the Umbro designers have had their welcome sugar rush
  is with the keeper kits; each of which (in blue, orange, and lilac) has a
  jaunty shoulder and sleeve decoration. Wolverhampton Wanderers Wolves’ latest
  home kit, made by Sudu, schools us on the history of Molineux. Before the site
  served as a football stadium, it was the location of the Molineux Pleasure
  Gardens; a Victorian public park with amusement offerings typical of the
  period. The traditional gold jersey features a debossed, ornamental print of
  swirls and shapes to honour that sense of fun. The overall look – from collar
  to cuff – is influenced by the club’s 70s threads. The home goalie kit is
  black and features the same print. The first-choice goalkeeper José Sá will
  wear pink for away fixtures, while the outfield players will be hitting the
  grass in turquoise; again, quite a popular colour for teams this season. This
  time the general feel is 80s-inspired, with dark green (almost black) ribbed
  collar and cuff. The third kit is yet to be released at the time of writing.

Shirts do look so much better without giant, garish logos though – especially when the logos are those of gambling companies. The home keeper shirt comes in black, and the away is green. The outfield away strip is much more interesting. Officially in the colours of “Phantom” (that’s white to you and me), and “Galactic Jade” (otherwise known as green) and red (red), the design is a nod to the club’s 1974-75 Magnificent Magyars-era away look. There are also some centralised pinstripes to add flair. The third kit is yet to be released, but is rumoured to feature the 1990s club crest. Crystal Palace The Italian brand Macron is again producing the Eagles’ fits. The home, of course, features the classic red-and-blue vertical stripes, but this time the stripes include white bands in between them for a refined feel. The cuffs are also white – as are the sleek shoulder panels. It is a classy kit; far nicer than last season’s “experimental” effort which looked for all the world like an 80s pub carpet. The keeper kit is a light green. The away kit, complete with Mandarin collar, is a bold, gold affair to celebrate the club’s jubilant 2025 FA Cup win. The PR people are calling it the “Golden Eagle” kit, which is a pun I can 100% get behind. No update, at the time of writing, on the third look. Everton Despite the Toffees finishing unexpectedly rather well last season (given the inauspicious start, anyway); being reunited with beloved manager David Moyes; and moving into a brand new stadium, the club has struggled to secure quality additions during the transfer window. But should they materialise, the new signings will have the privilege of wearing an attractive and intelligent Castore strip. Both the body and sleeve of the home shirt – in a familiar Everton blue – feature a prominent wave pattern to represent the River Mersey and the club’s new waterfront ground. The socks, paired with white shorts, showcase the silhouette of local landmark, Prince Rupert’s Tower (also an integral part of the club crest). The away strip is a pale yellow for shirt and socks, with blue shorts. The cuff features a design that mirrors the railway line which used to serve Liverpool’s docklands. The third kit is rumoured to have a black base and Prince Rupert’s Tower on the chest instead of the club’s full badge. Meanwhile, Jordan Pickford will either be in a green jacquard number (home) or black (away). Fulham Fulham have announced their “clean and contemporary” 2025-26 home strip; and clean and contemporary is an accurate description of the v-necked, zero-red, all-white fit (with piping, Adidas logo, and the brand’s famous stripes on the shoulder all in black). The aesthetically agreeable home jersey also features a rubber emblem of Craven Cottage balcony’s wrought ironwork. Compensating for the white-domination of the outfield look, the keeper will wear all red with metallic detail. The away strip is also a looker, and heavily reminiscent of the club’s 1999-20 lime green away threads. It shows off an oversized retro collar and the club crest of the same era. Back in the day the club sponsor was an internet service provider called Demon Internet; a company which no longer exists, but turns out had a very prophetic name. No news yet on the third kit. Leeds United The Leeds Adidas-made home kit stays traditional with the main colourway of white, blue, and yellow. But, consistent with a popular concept in kit design this year, there is a cute pattern inspired by the mosaic tile of the Lowfields Tunnel – the route Whites fans often take to Elland Road – which adds pizzaz to what is otherwise a simple but gratifyingly polished, attractive look for the club’s return to the top tier. The away strip is predominantly blue with multiple yellow touches, including an all-yellow twist on sponsor Red Bull’s logo. The goalkeeper kits are in a lighter blue (home) and orange (away), as well as deep purple. The third kit is a few alcopops down; a dizzying, chaotic mishmash of the traditional three colours. But I rather like it; it is everything but dull. Liverpool Liverpool start their season dealing with a maelstrom of emotions. There is the triumph of last season’s title win and plenty of exciting new faces – Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong among them. But there is tragedy too: the death of Diogo Jota, as well as the incident at the title parade that left scores of fans injured. Joining Wirtz et al is another addition to the club: Adidas. The brand has signed a 10-year deal with the club after Liverpool ended their five-year Nike stint. And a brand responsible for some of the club’s most iconic strips has hit the ground running: the home outfit is an all-red affair (officially “Strawberry Red”) with a white crewneck collar and cuff. The simplified Liver Bird emblem remains instead of the full crest (which personally I wish would make a comeback …) The away effort is also beautiful: an off-white jersey complemented by red and dark green accents. The shirt is paired with a choice of either a black short and white sock, or the reverse. Meanwhile, the third kit is a mint green, which calls to mind the early 90s away drip. Manchester City Well done to Puma, who have designed a lovely home uniform here. It is the standard sky blue (with navy blue accents), but a sash features for the first time on a City home shirt (it has been a frequent away design element). The collar shade is the same as the body, creating a clean, smooth aesthetic. The away kit is an all-black number referencing the club’s earliest known strip. Either that or they are going through their Johnny Cash era/a severe depression. It is dashing, though, and if one were to attempt to enter a Michelin-starred restaurant in a footie top, this is the one I would probably go for (see also: a funeral). The third kit is causing quite the reaction online – none of it good. The neon green accents are proving especially unpopular, but for my money* the raindrops-inspired main design on a drizzly-grey jersey for a club located in the soggy north-west is a stroke of genius. LS Lowry would be proud. The goalie kits are available in many loud colourways, including fuchsia. *But not literally because YNWA. Manchester United The Red Devils have been promoting their new home strip with the strapline: “United, wherever we go.” Bold, given that the club has five players hankering for a move, all of whom are only allowed to train at Carrington after the rest of the squad has gone home. The Adidas kit ostensibly pays homage to Old Trafford – a slightly odd decision now that Jim Ratcliffe has announced the 115-year-old stadium is to be replaced with a Norman Foster-designed behemoth (currently assigned the Ronseal-esque name of “New Trafford”). The back of the collar reads “Theatre of Dreams” – if the dream is to finish 15th – while the sleeve incorporates an “abstract” pattern referencing the stadium. After close inspection, I can report that this is a very, very abstract reference indeed. The away kit is white with plum accents and a lavender snowflake motif inspired by the 1990-92 strip. The colour scheme brings to mind the Jenny Joseph couplet: “When I am old / I shall wear purple”; just a thought in case the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo fancies a hat-trick of United stretches. The third kit is the best of the three; a black and yellow strip reminiscent of the 1993-94 away kit. Newcastle United Despite the Magpies’ extremely feelgood Carabao Cup win last season – marking a first domestic triumph in 70 years for this storied and well-loved club – it still pains me somewhat to compliment a team majority-owned by a regime whose greatest hits include dismemberment by bone-saw. But kit manufacturer Adidas continues its (for the most part) good summer run here. Clubs with traditional monochrome colours can sometimes struggle to distinguish themselves, but Adidas has introduced a serrated edge to those classic, thick black stripes. The border pattern is officially known as Shepherds’ plaid, although it actually reminds me of frits (those little black dots at the bottom of windscreens). Other elements include blue piping and an “HOWAY THE LADS” inscription on the back of the collar. The away kit is not as much reminiscent of a Saudi national team kit as could quite literally be a Saudi national team kit of before. The third kit, in burnt orange and blue, is a fun number with a stitched crest; inspired by that incredible late 90s away piece. It has the Adidas trefoil logo to maximise the retro feel. The goalie garms come in yellow, blue, purple, and pink, respectively. Nottingham Forest Forest’s new home kit is a throwback to its favoured early 90s strip, sharing the same polo-style collar and a wide pinstripe body. It is an extremely classy affair from Adidas, with a nice added detail being the also 90s-inspired shield crest. The keeper will wear yellow, orange, or blue. When the club, after its successful last season, initially released the new home shirt it was yet to feature a front sponsor – and was all the more handsome for it. But now, just in time for the team’s opening game, it advertises … a betting company. Surprise, surprise. The away fit is primarily cream and features a neat detail: a weave replicating the lace designs the city is famous for. No third kit news at the time of writing. Sunderland Danish brand Hummel frequently punches above its weight, and this smart new effort for Sunderland’s return to the top flight is no different. But not everybody is happy: the back of the players’ home shirt (but not the fan replica) is catching flak from supporters for the number placement – a white panel has been introduced to abide by Premier League legibility rules. The rest of the shirt is an elegant creation; a black v-neck with thin bands of the traditional red-and-white is a key characteristic. Also eye-catching is the crest placement; centrally aligned for the first time since the 1990s. And why shouldn’t the Black Cats show it off when it is one of the prettiest around? In a similar move to Leeds, Sunderland’s snazzy goalie kits allude to the patterned tiles of a city landmark (in this case, the Bridge Hotel); while the gorgeously retro royal-blue away outfield threads are further livened by a chequerboard weave with a subtle Roker Beach lighthouse motif. The third kit is an all-black number because: Black Cats, geddit? Tottenham Hotspur Spurs’s home kits have been rather banal and indistinguishable for a while now (sorry), but Nike has come up with something a little fresher this time for the Europa League holders (although that is no consolation for the departing Son). As with Sunderland, the new Spurs home shirt has a centrally aligned brand logo and club badge. The sleeve and underarm panels incorporate “Iron Ore” as an accent colour (Nike is at it again; they are grey), which is a departure, and ribbing on the body provides texture. Fans and players will also be wearing navy shorts with white socks. It is definitely the club’s least insipid home strip for a long time – although it retains a slight whiff of the training ground. More rousing is the luminous pink-and purple-gradient pinstripe keeper’s kit. The Lilywhites go all black with their away look – a prevalent choice this upcoming season. The Spurs kit in particular reminds one of Roger Federer’s iconic 2007 US Open drip. Nike’s blurb describes it as “razor-sharp, engineered for speed and built for stealth”, which unfortunately does sound a lot like club legend Harry Kane in his prime. The away keeper’s kit is akin to the home one but in mint-and-forest green. The third kit is yet to be officially launched, but it looks as though the bright yellow and navy shirt will air the beautiful 90s-era crest. West Ham Umbro has gone back to basics for the Hammers’ fetching new home strip. The traditional claret colour is the majority presence, but it is the dapper taping detail on the ribbed collar and cuff – and discreet underarm blue inserts (the colour is relegated to a smaller role than usual) – that subtly elevate this minimalist take. The applique full club crest is revived here after last season’s hideous variation and the crossed-hammers symbol is also printed on the back of the neck. The socks and shorts are in white. The away strip is equally nice and calm. Supposedly it is a callback to the 1996-97 away strip; I would argue that the call is not particularly loud. But it is a satisfyingly soft, creamy ecru with black sleeves and collar. The third kit, with a fold-over collar and a striking oversized Hammers logo on the breast, is a mix of submarine-deep navy as well as gold. Where the Umbro designers have had their welcome sugar rush is with the keeper kits; each of which (in blue, orange, and lilac) has a jaunty shoulder and sleeve decoration. Wolverhampton Wanderers Wolves’ latest home kit, made by Sudu, schools us on the history of Molineux. Before the site served as a football stadium, it was the location of the Molineux Pleasure Gardens; a Victorian public park with amusement offerings typical of the period. The traditional gold jersey features a debossed, ornamental print of swirls and shapes to honour that sense of fun. The overall look – from collar to cuff – is influenced by the club’s 70s threads. The home goalie kit is black and features the same print. The first-choice goalkeeper José Sá will wear pink for away fixtures, while the outfield players will be hitting the grass in turquoise; again, quite a popular colour for teams this season. This time the general feel is 80s-inspired, with dark green (almost black) ribbed collar and cuff. The third kit is yet to be released at the time of writing.
