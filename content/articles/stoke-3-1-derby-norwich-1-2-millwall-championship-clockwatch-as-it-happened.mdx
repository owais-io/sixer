  And earlier, Ben Fisher was at St Mary’s. Louise Taylor was at the Riverside
  to see Boro beat Swansea. Full-time around the grounds Championship
  Middlesbrough 1-0 Swansea Norwich 1-2 Millwall Oxford Utd 0-1 Portsmouth QPR
  1-1 Preston North End Stoke 3-1 Derby West Brom 1-0 Blackburn League One
  Barnsley 3-2 Burton Bolton 2-0 Plymouth Exeter 4-1 Blackpool Leyton Orient 2-0
  Wigan Mansfield 1-2 Doncaster Northampton 0-0 Bradford City Stevenage 1-0
  Rotherham Wimbledon 2-0 Lincoln Wycombe 1-2 Stockport League Two Barrow 0-2 MK
  Dons Bromley 2-0 Barnet Cheltenham 0-2 Chesterfield Crawley 1-2 Newport Crewe
  2-0 Accrington Fleetwood 2-1 Bristol Rovers Gillingham 1-0 Walsall Harrogate
  3-3 Grimsby Oldham 1-1 Colchester Swindon 3-2 Cambridge It was no classic, but
  Rob Edwards has his maiden win, Dael Fry nodding in from a corner. Alex Neil
  wins against his former club, and Norwich’s dreadful opening day record
  endures. Milutin Osmajic’s goal levelled it, and that’s a decent result for
  Paul Heckingbottom’s men. A good away win, and one where Pompey had to hold
  on, Adrian Segecic, the Australian, scoring the winner. A comeback win, and
  hopes will be high that this can be the season Stoke challenge to return to
  the playoffs, at least. The Baggies hold on, and claim Ryan Mason’s first win
  as manager. That seals it in the A50 derby. Big smiles for Mark Robins’ team.
  Darnell Furlong has been sent off, and that means Blackburn see a way back.
  It’s chaotic at the Hawthorns. And Stoke have won it, their striker crashing
  home, a huge roar in the Potteries. David McGoldrick, the former Ireland
  striker, scores the third goal as Barnsley complete a comeback to lead Burton
  3-2. That’s for his new boss Conor Hourihane. News from Scotland, where Elgin
  City have been beaten by East Kilbride in Scottish League Two, and that a
  first ever league win for East Kilbride. The celebrations will be huge among
  the Reid brothers, Kirsty Young and wee Ally McCoist. Lorraine Kelly will be
  cock-a-hoop, too, having been to school there. Jack Currie has gone close as
  Oxford push for an equaliser against Portsmouth. Same goes for Lewis Baker as
  Stoke keeper Jacob Widell Zetterström makes a fine save. Some very bad body
  language from Stoke’s Dutchman, Million Manhoef, as he is subbed off by Mark
  Robins. No handshake as he runs off the pitch. That’s not the done thing. A
  great ball from Doughty and Langstaff tempts Vladan Kovačević out of the
  Norwich goal and slots. Wycombe were two goals down to Stockport, have made
  five changes after missing a penalty and now Jamie Mullins’ goal has them back
  in it at 1-2. Ollie Norwood, once of Sheffield United, had been stroking it
  around until Mike Dodds made those changes. The midfielder Lewis Baker takes a
  pass from Sorba Thomas and unleashes a beauty. Stoke could have levelled
  against Derby but new signing Sorba Thomas misses a good chance. It’s Bolton
  2-0 Plymouth: Argyle’s return to League One is going the way of their
  Championship campaign. Not a great start from Tom “The Brand” Cleverley. The
  former Luton striker stabs in a cross and Derby lead in the A50 derby match.
  The American, captain for Canaries, blocks a clearance from Steven Benda and
  Norwich are back in it. Will Sargent stay? Swindon are leading 3-1 against
  Cambridge now, scoring three unanswered goals, through Darren Oldaker. A neat
  finish, and a deserved lead for the Lions, and a strike from one of their
  talents, who was a doubt to play today. A crashing header from a corner, and
  that’s the first goal of Handsome Rob Edwards’ Boro reign. There’s been an
  equaliser at Loftus Road. It’s a beauty from the PNE top man, one hell of a
  finish, in fact, scored on the counter. We go back underway in the
  Championship, where Hannah Hampton has been the guest of honour at West Brom,
  boing-boinging in her shirt at half-time. That is all from me today but John
  Brewin is here to take you through the next 45 minutes and the later
  kick-offs. Enjoy! Championship Middlesbrough 0-0 Swansea Norwich 0-0 Millwall
  Oxford Utd 0-1 Portsmouth QPR 1-0 Preston North End Stoke 0-0 Derby West Brom
  1-0 Blackburn League One Barnsley 0-2 Burton Bolton 1-0 Plymouth Exeter 2-1
  Blackpool Leyton Orient 1-0 Wigan Mansfield 0-0 Doncaster Northampton 0-0
  Bradford City Stevenage 1-0 Rotherham Wimbledon 1-0 Lincoln Wycombe 0-1
  Stockport League Two Barrow 0-0 MK Dons Bromley 1-0 Barnet Cheltenham 0-0
  Chesterfield Crawley 0-0 Newport Crewe 2-0 Accrington Fleetwood 2-0 Bristol
  Rovers Gillingham 0-0 Walsall Harrogate 0-0 Grimsby Oldham 1-1 Colchester
  Swindon 2-1 Cambridge The hosts lead after a bit of a nightmare from Whiteman.
  A cross comes in and his clearance is fast and low … and into his own net. The
  home side’s highline has come to haunt them. Bishop has a shot saved but
  Segecic finds the space and he hits it low and into the bottom corner in his
  debut. Goal! Barnsley 0-2 Burton (Tavares 35) Right in front of the away fans
  Tavares doubles the visitors’ league after rounding the keeper and slotting it
  home into an empty net. More goals in League Two! Crewe are up 2-0 against
  Accrington after Agius’ smart finish into the top corner. Swindon were 1-0
  down but are now 2-1 up against Cambridge. Smith with the counter to double
  their lead and he leaps for joy in celebration. Goal! Fleetwood 1-0 Bristol
  Rovers (Davies 25) Bonds puts in a peach of a ball for Davies who makes space
  before finding the opener. Goal! Exeter 2-1 Blackpool (Fletcher 21) Another at
  St James Park as Fletcher converts from a free-kick to bring one back! Goal!
  Bolton 1-0 Plymouth (Toal 23) It is the skipper for the hosts as Sheehan’s
  corner drifts to the back post and Toal is there to head it in. RED CARD!
  Wimbledon 0-0 Lincoln Jackson for Lincoln gets sent off. It initially looks
  like a 50/50 but his leg is way too high as he tries to contest the ball. Down
  to 10! Goal! Crewe 1-0 Accrington (Hutchinson 18) March finds Hutchinson off
  and he makes the shot into the top corner look easy. Goal! Leyton Orient 1-0
  Wigan (Sessegnon 18 og) Yikes! Sessegnon has just chested the ball into his
  own net after some confusion from Wigan in the back. The keeper tries to claw
  it out but with no luck. Goal! Exeter 2-0 Blackpool (Fitzwater 15) A fast
  start for the hosts! Cole turns from goal scorer to assist-maker after he
  swings in a corner which falls straight to Fitzwater. Blackpool look frazzled.
  First goal of the Championship 3pm kick-offs and you can’t say it isn’t
  deserved. The visitors fail to clear their lines after a long throw and Price
  takes advantage, getting on the end of it before firing the opener. Goal!
  Exeter 1-0 Blackpool (Cole 4) A well-worked throw-in! From Wareham it goes to
  Cole who takes a few touches before netting it straight into the bottom
  corner. Goal! Wycombe 0-1 Stockport (Wootton 9) Diamond gets into the box
  before pulling it back to Wootton for an easy shot from close range. Goal!
  Oldham 0-1 Colchester (Tucker 8) An early corner is well worked and a good
  cross finds the head of Tucker who scores his first goal for the club. Goal!
  Swindon 0-1 Cambridge (Brophy 4) And the first goal of the afternoon kick-offs
  in League Two. Kaikai puts the ball in that is headed into the path of Brophy.
  He hits it first-time right into the roof of the net. Goal! Barnsley 0-1
  Burton (Beesley 4) An elbow comes out in the box and the referee points to the
  spot. The No 9 is cool and calm and slots it into the left of the goalkeeper.
  Here we go! Championship Middlesbrough v Swansea Norwich v Millwall Oxford Utd
  v Portsmouth QPR v Preston North End Stoke v Derby West Brom v Blackburn
  League One Barnsley v Burton Bolton v Plymouth Exeter v Blackpool Leyton

  Accrington Fleetwood v Bristol Rovers Gillingham v Walsall Harrogate v Grimsby
  Oldham v Colchester Swindon v Cambridge Ben Fisher was at St Mary’s and here
  is his verdict: On this evidence the Welsh club – back at this level for the
  first time since 1982 after an extraordinary rise from non-league – are sure
  to be a fun addition but how they were given a galling reminder of the step up
  in trip, Saints scoring twice in the final nine minutes to earn a comeback
  victory and a first under Will Still. Preston North End have welcomed
  Morecambe fans to watch their first home game of the season against Leicester
  tomorrow. The club said in a statement: In light of the current situation at
  Morecambe Football Club, Preston North End are inviting Morecambe season card
  holders to attend next weekend’s match at Deepdale free of charge. Here at
  PNE, the club has a key focus on bringing the community together, and that
  extends beyond just our supporters. We feel for the fans and staff of
  Morecambe at this uncertain time, with the future of their club in doubt, and
  at a time where football is back it is not right that those fans are deprived
  of the opportunity to watch their team. Therefore the club are inviting all
  Morecambe 2025-26 season card holders to attend our Sky Bet Championship match
  against Leicester City on Saturday 16 August free of charge. Full details of
  how Morecambe fans can claim their ticket* will be confirmed on Monday 11
  August. We look forward to welcoming supporters of Morecambe next weekend and
  bringing the football community together at Deepdale. *Each 2025/26 season
  card holder at Morecambe can claim one match ticket, free of charge.
