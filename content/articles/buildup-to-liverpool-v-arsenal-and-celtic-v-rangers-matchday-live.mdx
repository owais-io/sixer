  Ewan Murray, who will be joining us later, has previewed the Old Firm. It was
  also a day of uncertainty for West Ham. There were a lot of reports around
  about Aston Villa agreeing a deal to sign Lucas Paqueta but those were
  premature. Villa were looking at a loan with an obligation to buy. West Ham
  have no intention of selling the Brazilian. The latest from the club and
  Paqueta’s camp is that he will not leave during this window. West Ham are at
  Nottingham Forest later. Paqueta trained on Saturday and travelled with the
  squad. There’s some doubt over his involvement because of the speculation over
  his future but sources at West Ham remain confident he’ll play. Nayef Aguerd,
  though, is not expected to be involved. He wants out. Saturday began with
  Chelsea agreeing to loan Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich. At 11.15am the
  teamsheets for their game against Fulham dropped. Two strikers in the starting
  11! Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. Then, at 12.41pm, Delap limped off. At 12.42pm
  I jokingly put in my match report that Chelsea would be ordering Jackson’s
  plane to turn around. Then, at 4pm, news broke that Chelsea had told Bayern
  the loan was off because of Delap’s injury. Only, Jackson is refusing to come
  back. He’s still in Munich. His agents are working to revive the deal with
  Bayern, which includes a €15m loan fee and €65m option to buy. Join the
  Football Weekly team at the Troxy in Limehouse. It appears I might be there
  too but it will be Max and Barry with the japery. These are fun events to be
  at, and it’s the first for two years. The big game in England is Liverpool v
  Arsenal, and both Jonathan Wilson and Barney Ronay have been looking ahead to
  the game. Plus the news from last week’s press conferences. Saturday’s Premier
  League action here: Some overnight headlines. The transfer window slams shut
  tomorrow. Ewan Murray will be at Ibrox for the lunchtime game between Rangers
  and Celtic. Before the match we’ll have a Q&amp;A with him on all things Old
  Firm, Scottish football and any other goings on. If you have any questions for
  Ewan, post them below the line or email matchday.live@theguardian.com. Serious
  questions, please; we’re all bantered out. To join in Ewan Murray’s Q&amp;A on
  all matters Old Firm and beyond, contact us at Matchday.live@theguardian.com.
