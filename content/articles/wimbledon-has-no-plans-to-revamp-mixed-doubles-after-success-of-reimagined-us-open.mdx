  The All England Club is not looking to change the format of the Wimbledon
  mixed doubles competition for future editions of the Championships despite the
  success of the “reimagined” tournament at the US Open. This year, the United
  States Tennis Association opted to transform the format of the mixed doubles
  event in order to attract the top singles players, a move officials believe
  was incredibly successful and which featured partnerships such as Emma
  Raducanu paired with Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek alongside Casper Ruud. The
  tournament was held before the men’s and women’s singles on a sold-out Arthur
  Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium, drawing a total of 78,000 fans. It
  was ultimately won by the previous year’s champions, the doubles
  specialistsSara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, but numerous stars nonetheless
  expressed hope that other grand slam tournaments would replicate the event. “I
  think it would be cool if all the slams did this,” said Jack Draper, who
  reached the semi-finals with Jessica Pegula. Raducanu was similarly effusive.
  “It would be so fun if all the slams got involved and did something similar,
  even if it was not the exact same format,” she said. “I think it was a huge
  success. So many fans got involved, so many people watching and tuned in. It
  got a lot of attention.” There is currently no appetite at the All England
  Club for the format of its mixed doubles tournament to change. The current
  setup is considered a key part of the Wimbledon fortnight and doubles is
  generally more appreciated at Wimbledon, with each of the competitions
  attracting greater crowds during the tournament. However, the success of the
  mixed event and the US Open’s “fan week” in New York has further illustrated
  how far Wimbledon has fallen behind the remainder of the grand slam
  tournaments. In recent years, the Australian Open, French Open and US Open
  have become three-week events, with each of those grand slam tournaments
  scheduling a large number of events during the qualifying week. Wimbledon
  remains hamstrung by its fragile grass courts and the limited space at the All
  England Club, with the qualifying event taking place more than three miles
  away in Roehampton. The organisers have attempted to address this issue with
  its Wimbledon Park Project, which aims to transform the Wimbledon Park golf
  course across the road from the club into an extension of the tournament
  grounds, allowing the Wimbledon organisers to host qualifying tournaments
  on-site and explore its own version of a pre-tournament week. The project,
  which would take many years to complete, has had to navigate numerous legal
  complaints. The remaining hurdle is a court process to determine whether there
  is a statutory trust on the land, which means the land must be used for public
  recreational purposes.
