  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Suzanne
  Wrack’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 1st Prospects How do you follow up on a sixth successive league
  title and a domestic treble, secured in the manager’s first season? For most
  teams the answer would be “with great difficulty”, but Chelsea are a different
  beast. Terrifyingly, despite their domestic dominance, the Blues left room for
  improvement last season. As Sonia Bompastor told the club’s website: “We did
  well in terms of trophies and results last season but we were not always happy
  with the performances and didn’t show as much consistency as I would like.
  We’re working on giving even more clarity to the players for them to execute
  what we want them to achieve on the pitch.” The difference going into the new
  campaign is they have a more settled squad and a more settled manager. There
  have been incomings, Ellie Carpenter the highlight, but this has been a summer
  of consolidation and of building towards the performances they want to see
  week in, week out. “I wouldn’t say there will be a big difference from last
  season,” said Bompastor. “This season, we will go further and in more detail
  on what we were trying to achieve last season. “Last season was about getting
  to know each other on the pitch. Now, we are in a better position to go into
  the details of how we want to work together.” The challenge of maintaining
  their stranglehold on the league title is getting harder each year. This
  season Arsenal are buoyed by their Champions League win and Manchester City
  are helmed by a new manager and welcoming back their injured cohort. Both
  clubs are desperate to unseat Chelsea, who face a stern test in the season
  opener when they welcome City to Stamford Bridge. It will be a chance for the
  champions to make a statement. Chelsea are still searching for their missing
  piece, too, their tough exit from the Champions League at the hands of
  Barcelona only made worse by Arsenal’s eventual triumph. With Barcelona’s
  financial struggles well documented and Arsenal’s underdog victory a surprise,
  the European door is open for whichever team push hardest at it. The manager
  Bompastor’s first season was phenomenal. Improving on the success of the
  preceding season while adapting to a new country and culture with your family
  is remarkable and has resulted in a well-deserved place on the shortlist for
  the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of the year award. Known for being a ruthless
  competitor, Bompastor has proven herself a worthy successor to Emma Hayes. The
  Champions League frustrations aired by Bompastor and her team after they had
  secured a domestic treble speak to the drive and ambition of the manager and
  her players. Off-field picture Chelsea have never been afraid to spend big to
  get the players they want, with Naomi Girma’s signing in January showing that
  is not about to change. The women’s side of the club was controversially split
  from the men’s and sold to Blueco, Chelsea’s parent company, for £200m in
  April. The valuation was justified in May when the Reddit co-founder, and
  husband of Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanian bought a 10% stake in the club for
  £20m. Ohanian has spoken publicly about the big ambitions he has for Chelsea
  and the deal prompted a lot of teams to turn green with envy. Star signing
  Chelsea have had a less star-studded window than in recent years, with the
  goalkeeper Livia Peng joining from Werder Bremen, the German forward Mara
  Alber coming from Hoffenheim and Becky Spencer’s loan deal turned permanent.
  The arrival of the Australia defender Carpenter from Bompastor’s former side
  Lyon is the highlight, though. Carpenter has twice won the Champions League
  with Lyon and has played in two World Cups and three Olympics with the
  Matildas. “Everyone has been so welcoming, the staff and the players,” she
  said. “I’m enjoying the sessions; it’s a great environment to work in, and it
  will bring the best out of me. It’s all very positive, and I’m excited to see
  more.” Stepping up There are so many exciting young players at Chelsea it is
  hard to choose. Aggie Beever-Jones and Hannah Hampton arguably had their
  “stepping up” campaigns last term. This season it’s Wieke Kaptein’s turn. The
  midfielder has shown flashes of brilliance when she has come into the side.
  “She just brings to the team a lot of quality out of possession,” said
  Bompastor when Kaptein played during the unusual four back-to-back games
  against Manchester City last season. “She’s a young player but she is really
  confident on the ball but also works so hard off the ball.” It was a good
  summer for … As with Arsenal, it would be unfair to not mention all of
  Chelsea’s Euro 2025 winners. Niamh Charles scored her penalty in the final
  shortly after coming on, Lauren James scored twice against the Netherlands
  despite injury struggles during the tournament, Beever-Jones shone in her
  cameos and scored against Wales, Keira Walsh is the metronome of England’s
  midfield, battling Lucy Bronze was sensational in so many ways and Hampton
  shrugged off Mary Earps’s shadow and then some with two heroic performances in
  penalty shootouts to add to a breakthrough tournament. Main initiative to
  attract more fans Chelsea announced way ahead of the season details of the
  four WSL games they will play at Stamford Bridge, in an attempt to get fans
  committed to showing up en masse. They mostly picked showpiece games, having
  previously tended to play lower-level opposition there, choosing their opener
  against City, their fixture against promoted London City Lionesses and games
  against Arsenal and Manchester United. They have sold The Bridge Pass, which
  enables fans to buy a ticket for all four fixtures. Chelsea supporters will
  have their travel subsidised and capped at £15 for domestic games outside
  London again.
