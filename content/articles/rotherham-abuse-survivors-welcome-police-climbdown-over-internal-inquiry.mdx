  Lawyers representing victims of sexual abuse in Rotherham have welcomed a
  climbdown that means South Yorkshire police will no longer lead an
  investigation into alleged crimes of former officers. The force came under
  fire last month after it emerged that it was to lead an investigation into the
  actions of its own officers, to be overseen by the police watchdog, the
  Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). On Friday it was announced that
  the National Crime Agency (NCA) would carry out the investigation under the
  “direction and control” of the IOPC. Five women who were abused as children by
  Rotherham grooming gangs have claimed they were also raped by police officers
  when they were as young as 12. Three former police officers have been arrested
  and a fourth former officer who was accused has died. The IOPC said it was
  responding to “concerns about SYP’s involvement and a perception of a conflict
  of interest”. It said it was a joint decision with South Yorkshire police
  (SYP) to ask the NCA to take over. Alexis Jay, who chaired the independent
  inquiry into grooming gangs, had expressed shock that SYP were leading the
  investigation. She told the BBC there were “many, many legitimate causes for
  victims and survivors at the time to feel a total lack of trust in SYP”. The
  law firm Switalskis, which represents survivors of abuse in Rotherham, had
  said victims had “no faith that SYP will do a thorough job of investigating
  alleged abuse by their own officers”. In 2022, Operation Linden concluded that
  SYP fundamentally failed in its duty to protect vulnerable children and young
  people during the period under investigation. After the U-turn, Switalskis
  said in a fresh statement: “We are pleased that South Yorkshire police have
  decided to hand the investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse,
  corruption, and the facilitation of abuse by former SYP officers to the
  National Crime Agency. “However, we remain concerned that the investigation is
  still being directed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, given the
  concerns raised by whistleblowers in relation to Operation Linden earlier this
  year. Nevertheless, we view this as a step in the right direction and hope
  that more survivors will now feel able to come forward to the NCA.” Five women
  told the BBC how they were exploited by grooming gangs in Rotherham when they
  were children and also allegedly sexually abused by officers. According to a
  special report by the BBC, one of the women said she was raped from the age of
  12 in a marked police car and that the officer threatened to hand her back to
  the groomers if she did not do as he said. The investigation shake-up was also
  welcomed by the South Yorkshire mayor, Oliver Coppard. He said: “I’m pleased
  that SYP, the IOPC and the NCA have listened to the concerns of those young
  women who have come forward to talk about their experiences.”
