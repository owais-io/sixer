  A prominent Labour peer has called for a statue of Clive of India to be
  removed from its high-profile spot outside the Foreign Office in London,
  arguing that visiting Indian citizens and dignitaries should not be forced to
  walk past it. Thangam Debbonaire said the statue commemorating Robert Clive’s
  bloody establishment of British rule presented the UK in a poor light and was
  historically inaccurate. “That statue continues to promote him in a victorious
  mode and as a symbol of something that had universal good,” she said. “I don’t
  think it’s helpful for any visitor to the Foreign Office, particularly those
  of us from Indian origins in the diaspora, but also visiting Indian people,
  Indian dignitaries, ambassadors, trade ministers, to walk into the Foreign
  Office past that statue. I don’t think that presents Britain in a particularly
  good light in the 21st century.” Clive is one of the most controversial
  figures from Britain’s colonial past. The historian William Dalrymple has
  called him an “unstable sociopath” and a violent asset stripper. The bronze
  statue, by the sculptor John Tweed was completed in 1912. It shows him in
  formal dress with one hand resting on the pommel of his sword, the other
  clutching papers. The inscription on the statue’s pedestal declares him simply
  as Clive. Lady Debonnaire, a former shadow culture secretary, said the statue
  and the panels around its plinth gave a false impression. “What it doesn’t do
  is contextualise or indeed give any honesty about what his presence in India
  actually did. He extracted a vast fortune. His former home, Powis Castle in
  Wales, contains hundreds if not thousands of objects that he took. “What the
  statue doesn’t do is give any honesty about the impact of colonial rule on
  India. There is still a popular view held publicly across the UK of empire as
  beneficial to its recipients.” Debbonaire described this as “wholly
  inaccurate”. “Before colonial rule, India was a very developed country. It
  understood free trade, it was trading with its neighbours – something the East
  India Company and the other colonising forces successfully crushed. “Since
  independence, India has grown economically, scientifically, in engineering
  terms, in computing terms, artistic, and so on and so forth.” Debbonaire was a
  Bristol MP when Black Lives Matter campaigners toppled the statue of the slave
  trader Edward Colston into the harbour in 2020. The statue was placed in a
  Bristol museum last year, along with explanations of who Colston was and what
  happened to his memorial. Of the Colston statue, Debbonaire said: “It still
  lives but in a different form, which gives it context. I don’t think the
  British are harmed by being more honest about the figures of our past. “The
  current presentation of Clive in its current form and place do not achieve
  that.” Debbonaire made comments at the weekend about the Clive statue at an
  appearance at the Edinburgh international book festival during a session on
  freedom of expression. Explaining why she brought up the Clive statue during
  that session, she said: “One of the things that really matters in freedom of
  expression is an understanding of power and whose stories get to be told and
  how, and whose stories do not get to be told.”
