  Everton have transferred ownership of Goodison Park to their women’s team in a
  move it is hoped will attract external investment amid growing interest in the
  sport in the US. The club announced in May that Everton Women would play their
  home games at Goodison next season following David Moyes’s side move to the
  new Hill Dickinson Stadium, and the Guardian has learned they have since taken
  ownership of the 133-year-old ground. Everton sold the women’s team to a
  company controlled by the club’s owner, Dan Friedkin, earlier this week.
  Documents published by Companies House revealed that Roundhouse Capital, the
  investment vehicle Friedkin used to buy Everton last December, are now the
  owners of Everton Women Football Club Limited in a deal that also includes
  Goodison Park. Everton declined to comment, but sources at the club told the
  Guardian that under the new structure Goodison Park will be held by Everton
  Women Football Club, with the Hill Dickinson Stadium belonging to Everton
  Football Club. It is hoped the transfer of ownership will increase the appeal
  of Everton Women to outside investors, although Roundhouse intends to maintain
  its majority investment and will only sell a minority stake. Chelsea sold 8%
  of their women’s team to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian earlier this year in a
  deal that valued the club at £240m, but Everton Women’s market value is
  nowhere near that level despite including Goodison Park. The ground is in a
  conservation area and the club have secured pre-planning approval for a
  redevelopment that includes affordable housing, a sports centre and community
  buildings to be managed by the Goodison Legacy Project. Everton are in the
  process of converting Goodison Park for Women’s Super League football before
  the new season, which begins with a Merseyside derby at Anfield on 7
  September. The lower tiers of the Park End, Gwladys Street and Main Stand are
  being refurbished, but the upper tiers will not be used. While the ground’s
  new capacity has not been finalised, the Guardian has been told it will
  initially about 20,000, with the scope to increase further if there is
  sufficient demand.
