  Donald Trump’s global tariffs faced significant skepticism in a federal
  appeals court on Thursday, as judges investigated whether the president had
  overstretched his powers just hours before the latest sweeping round of duties
  is set to kick in. The full 11-strong bench of the US court of appeals for the
  federal circuit in Washington DC is considering whether Trump exceeded his
  authority in imposing “reciprocal” tariffs on a large number of US trading
  partners. Judges repeatedly asked if Trump was justified in relying on
  emergency powers to effectively tear up the US tariff schedule without
  consulting Congress. Businesses challenging his strategy accused the White
  House of engineering a “breathtaking” attempt to force it through, unlike any
  trade move attempted by a US administration in two centuries. The 1977
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump has used to
  invoke emergency powers and enforce many of his tariffs, “doesn’t even say
  ‘tariffs’”, one of the judges noted. “Doesn’t even mention them.” In May a
  three-judge panel of the court of international trade blocked the import
  duties on grounds that Trump’s use of IEEPA was unjustified. The appeals court
  has stayed that ruling pending the outcome of Thursday’s hearing. “The
  government uses IEEPA all the time,” said Brett Shumate, assistant attorney
  general in the justice department’s civil division, representing the
  administration, to the court. He conceded, however, that it was the first
  IEEPA had been used to implement tariffs. The US trade deficit – the gap
  between what it imports to and exports from the world – has “reached a tipping
  point”, claimed Shumate, enabling Trump to take emergency action. “It’s
  affecting our military readiness,” he said. “It’s affecting our domestic
  manufacturing capability.” But Neal Katyal, a lawyer representing businesses
  challenging the tariffs, argued that Trump was laying a “breathtaking claim to
  power that no president has asserted in 200 years”. The administration is
  effectively saying “that our federal courts are powerless; that the president
  can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long he wants – so long as
  he declares an emergency”, Katyal argued. Trump posted about the hearing on
  his Truth Social platform on Thursday, calling it “America’s big case”. He
  said: “If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST
  TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE ‘DEAD,’ WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS.” “Now the
  tide has completely turned, and America has successfully countered this
  onslaught of Tariffs used against it,” the president claimed. “ONE YEAR AGO,
  AMERICA WAS A DEAD COUNTRY, NOW IT IS THE ‘HOTTEST’ COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN THE
  WORLD.” The challenge to Trump’s use of emergency powers has been brought by
  five small businesses acting alongside 12 Democratic-controlled states. They
  argue that the IEEPA was designed to address “unusual and extraordinary”
  threats arising in national emergencies, and that the reason for the tariffs
  do not meet that standard. The small businesses are being represented by a
  libertarian public interest law firm, the Liberty Justice Center. The
  non-profit is supported by billionaire rightwing donors including Robert
  Mercer and Richard Uihlein, who, paradoxically, have also been major backers
  of Trump’s presidential campaigns.
