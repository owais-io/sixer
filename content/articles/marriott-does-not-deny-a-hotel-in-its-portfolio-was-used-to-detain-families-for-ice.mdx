  Marriott, the hospitality giant, has not disputed recent revelations that a
  Louisiana hotel in its portfolio was used to detain migrant families before
  deportation, which contradicts a 2019 policy that it would not cooperate with
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In a new statement to the Guardian,
  the company suggested that its “acceptance of business” did not mean it
  supported the Trump administration’s immigration policies. The Guardian
  reported on Tuesday that a Sheraton hotel in the city of Alexandria, situated
  close to a major Ice deportation hub, has been used to hold family groups
  before they are removed from the US. The Sheraton brand is owned by Marriott
  International. Marriott did not initially respond to multiple requests for
  comment from the Guardian, but issued a three-sentence statement on Wednesday
  evening. “Our hotels provide public accommodation and event space, but are not
  designed or intended to serve as detention centers,” a Marriott spokesperson
  said. “Acceptance of business does not indicate support or endorsement of any
  group or individual. The property you have reached out about is operated by a
  third party, not Marriott International.” According to Marriott franchise
  documents, the company “seeks to do business with franchisees that share our
  values”. “Our franchisees are an integral part of our business and play a
  vital role in upholding the reputation of Marriott’s brands for excellence …”
  the document states. The Guardian’s report followed an article in the
  Intercept tracking the case of a father and his teenage son who were deported
  to Ecuador earlier this month after being arrested in New York. Phone tracking
  data cited by the Intercept and later seen by the Guardian confirmed the pair
  had been held at the Sheraton Four Points in Alexandria during their detention
  in Louisiana. A source with knowledge of hotel operations in the city
  indicated the venue has been used by Ice to detain families and unaccompanied
  minors since it was renovated in 2023. In 2019, during Donald Trump’s first
  term, Marriott rejected the idea that any of its hotels or properties – which
  include Sheraton and Courtyard hotels – would be used by Ice to detain
  immigrants. It made the statement at a time when the Trump administration was
  calling for a mass roundup of undocumented immigrants. Citing anonymous
  sources, ABC News reported at the time that administration officials had
  internally discussed the possibility that they might need hotel rooms because
  of limited capacity at Ice detention centers. “Our hotels are not configured
  to be detention facilities, but to be open to guests and community members as
  well. While we have no particular insights into whether the US government is
  considering the use of hotels to aid in the situation at the border, Marriott
  has made the decision to decline any requests to use our hotels as detention
  facilities,” a company spokesperson said in July 2019, according to ABC News.
