  Good afternoon. All states and territories have agreed to introduce reforms by
  the end of the year to close a “loophole” that has allowed potential child
  abusers to work across jurisdictions, the federal attorney general has
  announced. After a meeting of state and territory attorneys general on Friday,
  Michelle Rowland announced the “long overdue reform” to create a system that
  ensured those working with children who were “banned in one” jurisdiction were
  “banned in all”. “There are some 6m … working with children checks around
  Australia, and each of them is subject to a bespoke scheme in each state and
  territory – they are systems that do not talk to one another,” Rowland said.
  But Rowland ruled out establishing a national working with children check
  system, saying “the key issue there is time”. Top news Israeli minister says
