  Here’s an admission: I am 37 years old and have never learned to drive. I
  tried once, in the summer of 2021, and during my second lesson my instructor
  asked me if I played a lot of video games. When I answered yes, he said, “I
  thought so,” in a tone that was very clearly not complimentary. Regrettably,
  it turns out that hundreds of hours spent mercilessly beating my friends and
  family at Mario Kart and causing vehicular chaos in Grand Theft Auto do not
  translate instantly to real-life driving skills and judgment. I love racing
  games precisely because they are unrealistic. Because I still don’t have my
  licence, I ride my bike everywhere. It’s a giant orange monster of a thing,
  big enough for my two children to ride on the back, and it looks ridiculous.
  It makes me look ridiculous, next to the Lycra-clad middle-aged men on their
  carbon-fibre frames who zoom past me on the regular. It’s not something I
  could ever take out into the countryside or down some mountain trail. For
  that, once again, I must turn to video games. There are surprisingly few games
  about cycling, but rather like my abiding love for virtual golf, I have
  developed a longstanding mini obsession with them nonetheless. One of my
  all-time favourite games is Lonely Mountains: Downhill, a mountain-biking game
  that has you performing extremely precise adjustments to your trajectory down
  increasingly treacherous mountains, soundtracked by minimalist nature sounds
  and the sound of your rider smacking into boulders. Knights and Bikes is
  another lovable cycling-based adventure with the vibe of a 1980s summer
  holiday, starring a couple of kids exploring an island on two wheels. Lately
  I’ve been playing Wheel World, from California developer Messhof (who also
  made the one-on-one fencing classic Nidhogg). You ride around a sizeable
  island on an easy-to-handle racing bike, keeping an eye out for hidden paths
  and ramps and bike parts and taking on local riders in races when you feel
  like it. It’s a low-octane, cartoon-coloured Forza Horizon on a bike; a game
  that captures both the freedom and peace of cycling. You don’t feel like
  you’re controlling a vehicle; you can’t control gravity and wind and the
  contours of the road. Instead, you just ride. I’ve been recovering from an
  inconvenient, painful injury for most of this year (hence my periods of
  absence from the newsletter), so relatively undemanding, feelgood games are
  just what the doctor ordered. Wheel World is a racing game that calms the
  nervous system, a rare thing indeed. You are chosen at the start by an ancient
  bike spirit, and must challenge the island’s speediest champions to reclaim
  supernatural bike parts. Unlike in Lonely Mountains, none of this is
  particularly difficult – I was winning races effortlessly most of the time –
  but it feels really good to ride around, winding up hills and then
  freewheeling down towards the city at the centre of the island, heading out to
  the Provence-reminiscent farmland where you share the road with tractors. You
  don’t even have to worry too much about sticking to the tarmac. I’ve played a
  few racing games that are structured like Wheel World, but none that feel like
  it. It made me feel entirely at ease. It’s a whole game-world constructed
  entirely around bike worship, with no complications and no distractions.
  Tooling your ride is half the fun, as every new part slightly changes how it
  feels to pedal around (and they come in fun colours). The soundtrack is
  exactly energetic enough during races and exactly absent enough when you’re
  riding around enjoying the vibe and looking for something to do. After five
  hours or so I was clearly overqualified to take on the final race, but I
  didn’t want it to end, so I spent another evening exploring everywhere I
  hadn’t been yet instead. Everywhere I went was explicitly designed for
  two-wheeled pleasure. Sometimes in a period of physical or emotional recovery,
  you are in need of a huge game to get lost in; sometimes you just need
  something short and sweet with the power to lift your mood. Wheel World has
  helped me miss riding my real bike a little bit less. What to play Longtime
  readers will know that I have bounced off every Hideo Kojima game I’ve ever
  played, but our critic Tom Regan was delighted to return to Metal Gear Solid
  3, which is being rereleased later this week as Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake
  Eater. “Snake Eater is a leaner, meaner Metal Gear, a cold war caper owing
  just as much to James Bond as it does Apocalypse Now,” he writes. “Kojima
  makes no secret of his love of Hollywood, yet where his works often balloon
  into unwieldy epics, this game is still his most filmic achievement to date.
  It’s silly, self-contained and enjoyably campy, veering from the sublime to
  the ridiculous with admirable swagger. A seamless merging of cold war paranoia
  with anime-esque silliness.” Available on: PC, PS5, Xbox Estimated playtime:
  About 20 hours What to read According to Bloomberg (£), the reason that the
  much-anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong has taken seven years to make is that
  its developers were simply having too much fun and didn’t want to stop. “It’s
  for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have
  kept going,” said Team Cherry’s William Pellen. An incredible quote from
  Sony’s PlayStation boss, Hermen Hulst, from a Financial Times interview (£),
  after last year’s Concord fiasco: “I would like for us, when we fail, to fail
  early and cheaply.” Last week’s Gamescom convention in Germany broke
  attendance records, bringing 357,000 visitors to Cologne, according to
  organisers. Are in-person gaming events finally returning to a stable state
  after the pandemic years? What to click Silent Hill f, Goodnight Universe and
  Pokémon Legends: Z-A – the biggest games for autumn 2025 Metal Gear Solid
  Delta: Snake Eater – cold war chaos reborn with cinematic swagger | ★★★★☆
  Discounty – cozy shop life simulator takes satisfying approach | ★★★★☆ ‘Even
  after 20 years, I still cry’: the enduring brilliance of Metal Gear Solid 3:
  Snake Eater All Will Rise, the game empowering players to tackle real-world
  problems Question Block Reader Tom asks this week’s question: “With all the
  remakes flying around, where is the Vagrant Story update that everyone (me) is
  crying out for?” We’ve all got that one game, haven’t we? The one that we know
  would be positively transformed by modern tech if only someone would give it
  the green light? Vagrant Story isn’t completely pie-in-the-sky: Square Enix is
  a publisher that’s shown great respect to its back catalogue, and though a
  three-part mega-remake along the lines of Final Fantasy VII ain’t gonna
  happen, I give Vagrant Story a 50% chance of at least being rereleased,
  largely because Final Fantasy XIV’s Naoki Yoshida says it’s one of his
  favourite games. I’d expect it as a fan-pleasing surprise reveal in one of the
  big yearly showcases. We’ve revisited the question of most-wanted remakes a
  few times over the years, so why not ask again: what games from the annals are
  you still waiting for someone to dust off and revive? And if you’ve got
  another question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the
  newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.
