  Our live coverage is ending for the day. Thanks for reading along with us.
  Here is a summary of the key developments from today: The Texas legislature
  preliminarily approved a redrawn congressional map on Friday that gives
  Republicans a chance to pick up as many as five congressional seats,
  fulfilling a brazen political request from Donald Trump to shore up the GOP’s
  standing before next year’s midterm elections. The tentative map adoption
  passed in an 18-11 party-line vote. To get final approval, the state
  legislature’s upper chamber will take a vote, which is forecasted to happen
  this weekend, the Texas Tribune reports. However, a Houston Democratic state
  senator has plans to delay the final passage. More here. The US Department of
  Justice has released the transcript and audio recording of an interview
  conducted by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, with the convicted sex
  trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In a post on X, Blanche said the materials were
  being released “in the interest of transparency”, providing links to the
  transcript and to audio files. The release includes documentation from a
  two-day interview conducted on 24 and 25 July. The materials comprise redacted
  transcripts for both days, along with multiple audio recordings – seven
  separate parts plus test recordings for day one, and four parts plus test
  recordings for day two. More here. The FBI raided the home of Donald Trump’s
  former national security adviser turned critic John Bolton early on Friday
  morning and later also turned up at Bolton’s office. The federal search of
  Bolton’s house in the Washington DC area was understood to be part of an
  investigation involving the handling of classified documents, the Associated
  Press reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. A government source
  confirmed the raid to the Guardian, but did not disclose further details. More
  here. Donald Trump has threatened to take his federal crackdown on crime and
  city cleanliness to New York and Chicago, as the defense secretary, Pete
  Hegseth, ordered that national guard troops patrolling the streets of
  Washington DC under federal control will now be armed. The US president talked
  to reporters in the Oval Office and said: “When ready, we will start in
  Chicago … Chicago is a mess.” He added that then the administration “will help
  with New York”, amid the controversial and aggressive federal efforts to
  control leading Democratic-voting cities, each of which has a Black mayor.
  More here. The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has fired a general whose
  agency’s initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites
  from US strikes angered Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with
  the decision and a White House official. Lt Gen Jeffrey Kruse will no longer
  serve as head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), according to the
  people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized
  to discuss it publicly. The firing is the latest upheaval in the US military
  and intelligence agencies, and comes a few months after details of the
  preliminary assessment leaked to the media. More here. Kilmar Ábrego García
  has been freed on Friday from criminal custody in Tennessee so he can rejoin
  his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges, after
  a court ordered his release. Magistrate judge Barbara Holmes issued an order
  allowing the father of two to leave custody for the first time since his
  return to the US in June, following his wrongful deportation to El Salvador
  earlier this year. In a statement following his release, Ábrego’s lawyer, Sean
  Hecker said: “Today, Kilmar Ábrego García is free. More here. Canada will drop
  its counter-tariffs on some American goods in the coming days, Mark Carney has
  said, as the country’s prime minister looks to end a protracted trade war with
  longtime ally the United States. From 1 September, the Canadian government
  will remove some levies on US goods that comply with the North American
  free-trade pact, a move meant to “match” how the White House treated Canadian
  goods. Levies on steel, aluminum and autos will remain in place. The
  announcement comes one day after Carney and Donald Trump spoke on the phone.
  More here. The Trump administration on Friday ordered all construction to stop
  on Revolution Wind, a $4bn offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.
  The project, developed by the Danish company Orsted, had secured all necessary
  permits under the Biden administration and was expected to power more than
  350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring. “The project is
  80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind
  turbines installed,” Orsted said in a statement. The company said it is
  “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously”. “In particular,
  BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national
  security interests in the United States,” Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
  acting director, Matthew Giacona, said in a letter. He said that the company
  “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the
  project. The transcript of the interview between deputy attorney general, Todd
  Blanche, and Ghislaine Maxwell show that he asked the convicted sex trafficker
  about her and Epstein’s interactions with a spate of prominent Democrats,
  including former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and billionaire Democratic
  donor George Soros. Maxwell did not implicate any of those individuals in
  wrongdoing. Maxwell said she worked with Bill Clinton on his philanthropic
  endeavors, and that he used Epstein’s plane for a trip to Africa. But she said
  Clinton never visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, where
  Epstein was accused of abusing some girls. The Texas legislature preliminarily
  approved a redrawn congressional map on Friday that gives Republicans a chance
  to pick up as many as five congressional seats, fulfilling a brazen political
  request from Donald Trump to shore up the GOP’s standing before next year’s
  midterm elections. The tentative map adoption passed in an 18-11 party-line
  vote. To get final approval, the state legislature’s upper chamber will take a
  vote, which is forecasted to happen this weekend, the Texas Tribune reports.
  However, a Houston Democratic state senator has plans to delay the final
  passage. Senator Carol Alvarado revealed her filibuster plans in a post on
  social media. “Republicans think they can walk all over us. Today I’m going to
  kick back,” Alvarado’s post read. “I’ve submitted my intention to filibuster
  the new congressional maps. Going to be a long night.” The Guardian’s Sam
  Levine has the full story: Vice-president JD Vance said the FBI raids on
  former national security adviser John Bolton’s home and office were part of a
  legal process, not a political one against the now harsh critic of Donald
  Trump. “We’re in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John
  Bolton. I will say we’re going to let that investigation proceed,” Vance said
  in an interview with MSNBC’s Meet the Press. “What I can tell you is that,
  unlike the Biden DOJ and the Biden FBI, our law enforcement agencies are going
  to be driven by law and not by politics,” he added. “And so, if we think that
  Ambassador Bolton has committed a crime, of course, eventually prosecutions
  will come.” The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has moved to
  strip thousands of federal health agency employees of their collective
  bargaining rights, according to a union that called the effort illegal. HHS
  officials confirmed Friday that the department is ending its recognition of
  unions for a number of employees and reclaiming office space and equipment
  that had been used for union activities. It’s the latest move by the Trump
  administration to put an end to collective bargaining with unions that
  represent federal employees. Previously affected agencies include the
  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Environmental Protection Agency
  (EPA). In May, an appeals court said the administration could move forward
  with Donald Trump’s executive order that the president aimed at ending
  collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of federal employees
  while a lawsuit plays out. “This action ensures that HHS resources and
  personnel are fully focused on safeguarding the health and security of the
  American people,” department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement.
  Read the full story here: It looks like more defense officials were fired,
  shortly after we reported today that defense secretary Pete Hegseth dismissed
  Lt Gen Jeffrey A Kruse, who served as director of the Defense Intelligence
  Agency. The Associated Press is reporting that V Adm Nancy Lacore, who was
  chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as R Adm Milton Sands, a navy SEAL officer
  who oversaw Naval Special Warfare Command, were also fired. The reasons for
  their firings, the latest in a series of steps targeting military leaders,
  were not clear Friday. Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell said Hillary
  Clinton did not associate with Jeffrey Epstein, according to the
  recently-released transcripts of an interview conducted by Todd Blanche, the
  deputy attorney general, with Maxwell. When Maxwell was asked if Epstein “knew
  or had any sort of visit, dealings or associated with Hillary Clinton,”
  Maxwell responded, “I would say no.” “Did you ever see them together?,” asked
  Blanche. Maxwell responded “No.” Maxwell was also asked whether Epstein ever
  did any business with the Clintons. She said he may have given money to their
  foundation. “I think he did do that. And that, I believe, the money that he
  may have given could have been independent of me,” Maxwell said. The
  Guardian’s Lauren Aratani brings us her analysis of Donald Trump’s push for
  steeper rate cuts and the Fed’s reality: Stocks soared on Friday following the
  strongest signal yet that US the Federal Reserve is gearing up to start
  cutting interest rates again this fall. But how long can this celebration
  last? While Wall Street cheered the biggest headline from the speech by the
  Fed chair, Jerome Powell, at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming,
  Powell also delivered a reality check on where interest rates could settle in
  the longer term. “We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over
  the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the
  2010s,” said Powell. In other words: even if the Fed does start cutting
  interest rates again this year, they may not fall back to their pre-pandemic
  levels. It’s a signal, despite the short-term optimism on potential rate cuts,
  that the Fed’s long-term outlook is more unstable. “Markets might be ahead of
  their skis on how aggressive the Fed is going to be in reducing interest
  rates, because the neutral rate might be higher than some believe,” Ryan
  Sweet, an economist at Oxford Economics, said. Higher rates means borrowing
  money for loans, such as mortgages, will be more expensive. The average
  30-year fixed mortgage rate was just under 3% in 2021, when interest rates
  were near zero. Now the average mortgage rate is closer to 6.7%. Paired with
  home prices at near-record highs, elevated mortgages mean many Americans will
  continue to struggle to purchase a home. Although Trump has been pushing the
  Fed for months to decrease rates to 1%, claiming that Powell is “hurting the
  housing industry very badly”, it seems unlikely that rates will return to such
  a level any time soon. The Fed is trying to achieve a Goldilocks balance.
  Rates that are too high risk unemployment, while rates that are too low could
  mean higher inflation. Policymakers are searching for a “neutral” level, where
  everything is just right. Read the full analysis here: The US government has
  taken an unprecedented 10% stake in Intel in a deal with the struggling
  chipmaker and is planning more such moves, according to Donald Trump and
  commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, the latest extraordinary intervention by
  the White House in corporate America. Lutnick wrote on X: “BIG NEWS: The
  United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American
  technology companies. Thanks to Intel CEO @LipBuTan1 for striking a deal
  that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.” Trump met with Lip-Bu
  Tan on Friday and posed for a photo with Lutnick. The development follows a
  meeting between Tan and Trump earlier this month that was sparked by the US
  president’s demand for the Intel chief’s resignation over his ties to Chinese
  firms. Here’s the full story: The Internal Revenue Service has halted planned
  layoffs and is offering jobs back to some employees who previously took the
  so-called “fork in the road” that encouraged staffers to take a buyout as the
  agency scrambles to boost staffing ahead of tax season, Axios reports. The
  so-called “department of government efficiency’s” (Doge) early days made
  headlines for targeting government workers with layoffs and pushing others to
  resign. But the IRS is now reversing course, joining other federal agencies,
  either rehiring terminated workers or pulling back on “reduction in force”
  plans. In February, the IRS laid off roughly 7,000 workers in Washington and
  around the country. Donald Trump announced that he named Sergio Gor to be the
  next US ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian
  affairs, according to a post on Truth Social. Gor is currently the director of
  the White House presidential personnel office, and is slated to remain in that
  position until his confirmation. “For the most populous Region in the World,
  it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my Agenda
  and help us, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” Trump wrote on Friday. Carol Alvarado,
  a Texas Democratic senator from Houston, says she intends to filibuster
  tonight in the Texas senate to delay Republicans from passing a redrawn
  congressional map. “Republicans think they can walk all over us. Today I’m
  going to kick back. I’ve submitted my intention to filibuster the new
  congressional maps. Going to be a long night,” she wrote in a post on X,
  accompanied by a picture of sneakers. Democrats have gone back and forth with
  Phil King, the bill’s GOP sponsor, since this morning, trying to get him to
  admit that he considered race in drawing the maps. The local television
  station KVUE has more on the rules Alvarado will have to follow as she
  filibusters the new congressional map. Alvarado will not be able to eat or
  drink and must stand at her desk the whole time without breaks for the
  bathroom, the outlet reported. The national guard personnel deployed on the
  streets of Washington DC will now be armed, a defense official confirmed to
  The Guardian. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the nearly 2,000 of
  the national guard members to carry “service-issued weapons,” the official
  said. “The Interim Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard retains the
  authority to make any necessary force posture adjustments in coordination with
  the D.C. Metropolitan Police and Federal law enforcement partners,” said the
  defense official. The Pentagon and the US army had said last week that troops
  would not carry weapons. In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump
  announced that his administration is undergoing a “major tariff investigation”
  into imported furniture and is expected to release its findings within 50
  days. Trump said the US will impose tariffs (at a rate still to be determined)
  on foreign-made furniture, in efforts to revive the industry in states
  including North Carolina, South Carolina, and Michigan. Defense secretary Pete
  Hegseth fired Lt Gen Jeffrey A Kruse, the military’s top intelligence officer.
  The Washington Post first reported the story. Kruse, who served as Defense
  Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, is the second senior Air Force general in
  a week to be forced out or retire unexpectedly. On Monday, Air Force chief of
  staff Gen David Allvin announced he was stepping down after just two years in
  the role, a position typically held for four years. A spokesperson for the DIA
  told CBS News that deputy director Christine Bordine will assume the role of
  acting director “effective immediately.” “The firing of yet another senior
  national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous
  habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for
  our country,” said senator Mark Warner, vice chair of the Senate Select
  Committee on Intelligence, in a statement. The firing comes a few months after
  details of the agency’s preliminary assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear
  sites from US strikes leaked to the media. It found that Iran’s nuclear
  program has been set back only a few months by the US strikes, contradicting
  assertions from Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The
  transcripts are more than 300 pages, but here it goes … Blanche said, on
  record, that their conversation wasn’t “promising to do anything” for Maxwell.
  But that anything she said couldn’t be used against her, unless she provided
  false statements or there was a retrial in her case. According to Maxwell,
  Epstein didn’t have any video or photographic evidence of any high-profile
  individuals committing sexual offences. And to that point, Maxwell said she
  didn’t hear or witness any instances of Epstein blackmailing powerful people.
  Maxwell recruited a number of masseuses for Epstein but “never checked their
  age or credentials”. She added that, throughout her time with Epstein, she
  never heard any examples of “sexually inappropriate contact” between Epstein’s
  guests and in-house masseuses. Despite her claims that Epstein didn’t extort
  anyone, Maxwell does not believe that Epstein died by suicide. She chalked
  that up to “mismanagement” at the bureau of prisons. In the interview Maxwell
  said she does believe that Epstein “did a lot of, not all, but some of what
  he’s accused of”. But she maintains that “he became that man over a period of
  time”. Maxwell said that she “never” saw Donald Trump receive a massage. She
  also said that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting
  in any way,” adding that he was “a gentleman in all respects” whenever she saw
  the president. Maxwell also didn’t recall former president Bill Clinton
  receiving a massage while travelling with Epstein. One notable point is that
  Maxwell denied ever recruiting masseuses from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. “I’ve
  never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember. I
  can’t ever recollect doing that,” she told Todd Blanche. A reminder that Trump
  claimed his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein stemmed from the convicted sex
  offender’s efforts to hire workers away from Trump’s Florida club. Maxwell did
  not remember whether Trump submitted a letter for Epstein’s 50th birthday
  album, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. She also couldn’t remember
  asking Trump to contribute. In Ghislaine Maxwell’s first interview with deputy
  attorney general Todd Blanche, on 24 July, she said that she “may have met”
  Donald Trump in 1990, before meeting Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell went on to
  describe the relationship between the president and Epstein as “friendly”,
  although she didn’t know how the two men met or how they became friends. She
  added that she “never” saw the president receive a massage: I actually never
  saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the
  president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never
  inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a
  gentleman in all respects. Maxwell also contested Trump’s claims she recruited
  masseuses from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. “I’ve never recruited a masseuse
  from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember. I can’t ever recollect doing
  that,” she said in the interview with Blanche. A reminder that the president
  said in July that his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein stemmed from the
  convicted sex offender’s efforts to hire workers away from Trump’s Florida
  club. “People were taken out of the spa, hired by him, in other words, gone,”
  the president said. The Department of Justice has released the transcripts and
  audio recordings of the interviews between Ghislaine Maxwell, the former
  girlfriend of child sex-offender Jefrrey Epstein, and the deputy attorney
  general, Todd Blanche. The interviews between Blanche and Maxwell took place
  on 24 and 25 July 2025, with her legal representatives present. Maxwell is
  serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking. The justice department
  will also send the first tranche of records from the Jeffrey Epstein
  investigation to the House oversight committee, after receiving a subpoena for
  the files. Earlier this week, the committee chair, Representative James Comer,
  a Republican, said that his aim is to make the files public – while protecting
  the safety and identities of the victims. A court has ordered the release of
  Kilmar Ábrego García from criminal custody in Tennessee. On Friday, magistrate
  judge Barbara Holmes issued an order allowing the Maryland father of two to
  leave custody for the first time since his return to the US in June, after his
  wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. The 30-year-old was
  initially wrongfully deported by federal immigration officials in March.
  According to the Trump administration, Ábrego was affiliated with the MS-13
  gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny. During his detention at
  El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was
  physically and psychologically tortured, according to court documents filed by
  his lawyers in July. Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, the Trump
  administration faced widespread pressure to return him back to the US,
  including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to
  “facilitate” his return. In June, the Trump administration returned Ábrego
  from El Salvador, only to hit him with a slew of human smuggling charges,
  which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is
  expected to begin in January. An update from the Texas senate, where Molly
  Cook, a Democratic lawmaker from Houston, is now questioning Phil King about
  the new Texas map. Her line of questioning appears designed to highlight that
  the senator is not completely blind to race in Texas. She points out that he’s
  likely done polling in his own races that breaks down results by race and has
  analysed other statewide racial data as part of his job as a legislator. “I
  have not drilled into racial data with regard to redistricting,” King says.
  When asked about the ongoing discussions about a possible bilateral meeting
  between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president said it will be
  “interesting to see” whether that goes ahead. Earlier he explained his
  decision to let the two leaders have a meeting together: “I could have been at
  the meeting, but a lot of people think that nothing’s going to come out of
  that meeting.” Trump went on to say that he’ll know “one way or the other”
  about his next steps in two weeks. “It’s going to be a very important
  decision. And that’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs,
  or both, or do we do nothing and say ‘it’s your fight,’” he said. Earlier the
  president said he was “not happy” when asked about a US factory being hit
  during a Russian strike in Ukraine. The president just confirmed that he has
  spoken with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate majority leader,
  John Thune, about a plan to raise $2bn from Congress to help fund his
  ‘beautification’ plans for DC. “I think it’s going to be very easy to get it’s
  going to be not a lot of money. I wouldn’t even know where to spend the number
  that you mentioned, but it’s going to be money to beautify the city,” he said
  in response to a reporter’s question in the Oval Office. “I’m not a fan of
  John Bolton. I thought it was a sleazebag, actually, and he suffers major
  Trump derangement syndrome,” the president said, speaking about the raid on
  his former national security adviser’s home. Trump repeated that he tries to
  “stay out of that stuff”, and that when it came to the search of Bolton’s
  home, he “purposefully” didn’t want to get involved. “I saw that just like
  everybody else,” he added. The president then spent time talking about how he
  too was subjected to a raid, referring to the FBI search of the his Mar-a-Lago
  estate in 2022 during an investigation into the handling of presidential and
  classified documents. “They went through everything you can imagine,” Trump
  said. The president just shared a picture of himself and Vladimir Putin at
  their summit last week in Alaska. Trump even hinted that Putin may attend the
  2026 World Cup in the US. “I believe he will be coming, depending on what
  happens, he may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens,” he said.
  The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, has gifted Donald Trump the first ticket
  to the 2026 World Cup’s final match. In between repeating baseless claims that
  DC crime data is “phoney”, and touting the work of the National Guard in the
  nation’s capital, the president says that he’s willing to bring in the
  “regular military” to the nation’s capital if needed. He also repeated his
  threats to send the military to cities in blue states, singling out Chicago
  today: Chicago is a mess. You have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent,
  and we’ll straighten that one out probably next. That’ll be our next one after
  this, and it won’t even be tough. The president is now speaking in the Oval
  Office, joined by JD Vance. He says that the 2026 World Cup draw will take
  place at the Kennedy Center on 5 December, which will determine the match
  schedule. The US is one of three host countries for the tournament. “This will
  drive more than $30bn in US economy and create 185,000 American jobs. No
  sporting event attracts more attention, or more fans, or anything else. I just
  look forward to the draw,” Trump said. The vice-president, JD Vance, has said
  that the FBI raid and investigation into former national security adviser John
  Bolton is not because he’s a critic of the president, according to an
  interview with NBC News. “We don’t think that we should throw people – even if
  they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us
  politically – you shouldn’t throw people willy-nilly in prison. You should let
  the law drive these determinations, and that’s what we’re doing,” Vance told
  NBC anchor Kristen Welker. The Texas senate is taking a brief recess amid
  questions about the state’s new congressional map. State senator Phil King,
  the bill’s sponsor, has been taking questions for about an hour and a half
  from Democrats. In nearly all of their questions, Democrats have asked King
  questions about the racial makeup of the new districts. King has essentially
  said the same thing over and over – he did not consider racial data when
  looking at the map and the primary purpose why districts look the way they do
  is to benefit Republicans. King has also conceded that he did not draw the
  maps himself and has been a lot more circumspect about what data mapmakers
  looked at when they drew lines. The reason King is answering this way is
  because any concession that racial data was used would be a significant tool
  Democrats would use in expected legal fights ahead to argue that the new maps
  diminish the influence of minority voters in the state. The FBI raided the
  home of Donald Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic John
  Bolton on Friday morning. A government source confirmed the raid to the
  Guardian, but didn’t provide additional details. The search of Bolton’s house
  in Maryland was part of an investigation involving the handling of classified
  documents, according to various reports. Bolton was not at home during the
  raid, and said he did not know it was happening, according to CNN. Agents
  later began a search of his DC office, a source told the outlet. For his part,
  the president said that he wasn’t briefed on the raid when speaking to
  reporters earlier. He added that he expects more details to come from the
  justice department. “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s a real sort of a
  lowlife,” Trump said of his one-time cabinet official turned adversary. “He’s
  not a smart guy. But he could be a very unpatriotic. I’m going to find out.”
  The president also spent time extolling the fact there have been no murders in
  the nation’s capital in the last week.“That’s the first time in anybody’s
  memory that you haven’t had a murder in a week,” he said. However, the city
  last experienced no homicides (over a seven-day period) as recently as July
  this year, according to DC police data. In that same impromptu press
  conference, Trump also said that he will fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa
  Cook if she doesn’t resign, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the
  US central bank. At the same time, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, nodded to a
  possible rate cut at the central bank’s September meeting. However, Powell
  stopped short of committing to cutting rates next month during a speech to
  policymakers and economists at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference.
  Meanwhile, beyond DC, the Texas senate has begun final deliberations to pass
  its redrawn congressional map. The plan, which is expected to pass this
  afternoon, could net five congressional seats for Republicans in 2026. Police
  officers from around Georgia, and around the country, gathered on Friday
  morning at the First Baptist Church of Atlanta for a memorial service for
  police officer David Rose, who was killed on 8 August while fending off a
  gunman at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) headquarters. “David Rose was
  a man whose life was defined by service,” said interim police chief David
  Padrick, noting his service in the Marine Corps before joining the county
  police force. “David was more than a co-worker. He was family.” Rose was his
  class leader in the police academy, from which he graduated only six months
  before his death. “As the class leader, you are expected to lead from the
  front and not the rear,” said sergeant Trey Jones, his instructor. “He carried
  himself with a calm presence and a clear sense of purpose … He was
  unshakable.” Rose’s death has been met with a wide outpouring of grief in
  Atlanta. He was the father of two children. His wife is pregnant. About 500
  police officers filled the sanctuary. Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp,
  attended, as did officers from as far away as New York City and Aurora,
  Colorado. Many CDC employees also attended the memorial. Their grief was
  matched by fury at the Trump administration, which many said had been
  insufficiently supportive since the shooting, if not tacitly encouraging the
  anti-vaccine sentiment which drew the shooter to their door. One remarkable
  thing evident from watching Texas state senator Phil King’s testimony about
  the state’s new congressional map is the way he openly says the map is being
  redrawn for partisan purposes. “HB 4, I believe, should elect more Republicans
  to the US Congress,” King said. This is an admission that would only be made
  behind closed doors a decade ago. But in 2019, the US supreme court said that
  federal courts could do nothing to stop gerrymandering for partisan purposes.
  That is a huge boon for lawmakers. Since they are still prohibited from
  drawing lines based on race, they can get some legal protection by simply
  saying they are going to draw districts for partisan purposes. Lawmakers are
  betting that there will be no blowback from voting for openly admitting that
  they are doing this for partisan gain. Of course, the risk is also quite
  limited since they are in districts already drawn to virtually guarantee their
  re-election. Texas state senator Phil King, the sponsor of the bill to enact
  the redrawn congressional map, is taking questions from Democrats in the Texas
  senate about the new map. Democrats are asking questions about how the map was
  made that can be used in expected court challenges to the map. King knows this
  and is using his remarks on the floor to try to immunize the map from future
  challenges. To bolster that effort, he’s insisting over and over again that he
  did not consider race or look at racial data when drawing the map. “I also
  want you to know, and I can’t emphasize this enough, that I have not reviewed
  any racial data,” he said at the outset of his remarks. The US supreme court
  has said that lawmakers are entitled to a “good faith” presumption in drawing
  maps, so Republicans will get a lot of leeway as long as they don’t openly
  admit to considering race. The Texas senate has begun final deliberations to
  pass its redrawn congressional map. The plan, which is expected to pass this
  afternoon, would add as many as five congressional seats. The Texas house of
  representatives passed the measure earlier this week. Republicans currently
  represent 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats. They could win as many as 30
  seats under the new plan. As we’ve been reporting this morning, FBI agents
  have searched the home of John Bolton, a former adviser to Donald Trump turned
  persistent critic, this morning in what a source familiar with the matter told
  Reuters was part of a national security inquiry. The investigation is focused
  on the potential criminal release of classified information, the source added.
  An FBI spokesperson confirmed “court-authorized activity” in the area of
  Bolton’s home in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, and also
  confirmed law enforcement activity at Bolton’s Washington DC office, earlier
  reported by CNN. Speaking to reporters during a museum visit in Washington DC
  earlier this morning, Donald Trump said that he will fire Federal Reserve
  governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign, intensifying his effort to gain
  influence over the US central bank. What she did was bad. So I’ll fire her if
  she doesn’t resign. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, has
  said she had “no intention of being bullied to step down” after Trump on
  Wednesday called for her resignation on the basis of allegations about
  mortgages she holds in Michigan and Georgia. The Department of Justice is
  reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top
  Trump official telling the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, that the case “requires
  further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the board. “At
  this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the
  official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg News. “Do it today before
  it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve
  during this time with a cloud hanging over her.” Cook is among three Fed
  governors appointed by former president Joe Biden whose terms extend beyond
  Trump’s time in office, complicating the president’s efforts to gain more
  control by appointing a majority of the seven-member board of governors. Two
  of the remaining six board members were appointed by Trump – governor
  Christopher Waller and vice-chair for supervision Michelle Bowman. The
  president is planning to announce today that the 2026 World Cup draw will take
  place at the Kennedy Center in Washington this December, NBC News is
  reporting, citing a White House official. The announcement combines Trump’s
  enthusiasm for the World Cup and his cultural realignment of the Kennedy
  Center. We’ll bring you more on that as it comes later. The US deputy treasury
  secretary, Michael Faulkender, is leaving the Trump administration less than
  five months after being confirmed by the Senate, the treasury department said.
  Faulkender is the second Senate-confirmed official to leave the department
  this month, after the departure of IRS commissioner Billy Long, who said he
  was being tapped as ambassador to Iceland. The US treasury secretary, Scott
  Bessent, thanked Faulkender for his work at the department but gave no reason
  for his departure. Trump nominated Faulkender, a University of Maryland
  finance professor, in December to serve as the No 2 official at the treasury,
  where he had been assistant secretary of economic policy during Trump’s first
  term. He was confirmed by the Senate for the role on 26 March. At the end of
  the first Trump administration, Faulkender had returned to the University of
  Maryland’s Robert H Smith School of Business, where he has been a finance
  professor since 2008. He had also served as the chief economist for two years
  at the America First Policy Institute, a conservative thinktank that has
  helped shape Trump’s policy agenda. The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
  has repeatedly endorsed the Reformation Red Pill podcast, and has appeared on
  four episodes. But the former pastor who hosts the show, and who attends
  Hegseth’s theocratic church, has voiced a range of extreme positions in recent
  months on issues including Ice raids, capital punishment, the racist “great
  replacement” theory, adultery and neo-Nazism. The revelations come on top of
  recent media reports focused on Hegseth also boosting a video of Douglas
  Wilson and other Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) pastors
  arguing that women should lose the vote in the United States. They also follow
  previous revelations about Hegseth’s links to or apparent sympathies for
  Christian nationalist positions. Joshua Haymes is a member of the CREC-aligned
  Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship (PHRF), and his podcasts advocate for the
  CREC’s moral and theological positions. As the Guardian previously reported,
  he once served as a pastoral intern at the church. Online he has claimed that
  liberalism is a greater threat to the US than neo-Nazism, and that the Bible
  is “pro-Ice raids”. On X, he has also advocated for capital punishment for
  adultery and abortion, and appeared to call for the drowning of LGBTQ+ Pride
  marchers. Despite distancing himself from the PHRF, Haymes regularly hosts
  Brooks Potteiger, the congregation’s pastor and Hegseth’s closest spiritual
  adviser. Potteiger’s most recent appearance was just over a week ago. Pottiger
  appears alongside Haymes in the profile image for the podcast’s channel on
  YouTube, whose description reads: “We created this podcast as a resource to
  serve you in your reformation red pill journey.” These materials, mostly
  published since Hegseth was confirmed as secretary of defense, underline the
  extreme Christian nationalist positions at Pilgrim Hill, in Goodlettsville,
  Tennessee, the community within which Hegseth acquired an 8,800 sq ft, $3.4m
  mansion in 2022. The Guardian repeatedly sent requests for comment to Hegseth
  via the Pentagon’s centralized communications office. A Pentagon spokesman
  offered a link to a transcript of a 14 August press conference in which
  Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters Hegseth “is a proud
  member of a church that is affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed
  Evangelical Churches which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson. He is a very
  proud Christian and has those traditional Christian viewpoints.” Donald Trump
  has confirmed a Guardian report that he wants Russia and Ukraine to meet in a
  bilat before he intervenes again, although he acknowledged he might have to
  get involved. We’re going to see Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together.
  It’s like oil and vinegar. They don’t get along too well, for obvious reasons.
  And then we’ll see whether or not I would have to be there. I’d rather not.
  I’d rather have them have a meeting and see how they can do. The FBI is now
  reportedly searching John Bolton’s DC office, a source tells CNN. This comes
  after our earlier post about Bolton speaking with agents in the lobby of the
  office building, according to the Associated Press. Speaking to reporters
  earlier, the president praised the fact there have been no murders in the
  nation’s capital in the last week. “DC was a hellhole, and now it’s safe,”
  Trump said. “That’s the first time in anybody’s memory that you haven’t had a
  murder in a week.” However, DC police data shows that the city last
  experienced no homicides (over a seven-day period) as recently as July this
  year. Specifically between 12 and 19 of July. There have been several similar
  stretches earlier this year, lasting a week or more, without murders in DC.
  The president has routinely claimed, without evidence, that DC officials have
  manipulated crime data. Signalling that the Federal Reserve could restart
  interest rate cuts, the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell, said the US
  economy had “faced new challenges” over the past year. Focusing on inflation,
  Powell said Trump’s tariffs had “begun to push up prices in some categories of
  goods”. He added he expected the effects of tariffs to “accumulate over the
  coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts”. Powell also
  said: “Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labour
  force growth.” Some of the changes to tax, spending and regulatory policies
  brought in by the Trump White House could also have “important implications
  for economic growth and productivity”, he said. Changes in trade and
  immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this
  environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural,
  developments is difficult. Powell’s speech did not mention the political
  pressure he, and the Fed, have been under in recent months, after Trump
  repeatedly threatened to fire him, which has raised questions over the
  independence of the central bank. Instead, he repeatedly mentioned the Federal
  Reserve’s mandate “to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the
  American people” and said the central bank remained “fully committed to
  fulfilling our statutory mandate”. The president said he wasn’t briefed on the
  raid on John Bolton’s home, while making an impromptu visit to the People’s
  House exhibit near the White House. Sporting a “Trump was right about
  everything” hat, the president said that he saw the news of the raid on
  television earlier. “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s a real sort of a
  lowlife,” Trump said. “He’s not a smart guy. But he could be a very
  unpatriotic. I’m going to find out.” The president added that he expects to
  find out details of the search from the justice department later. “I tell the
  group I don’t want to know, but just you have to do what you have to do. I
  don’t want to know about it.” Over the last couple of hours, key leaders in
  the justice department have co-signed FBI director Kash Patel’s minatory post
  on X as agents searched John Bolton’s Maryland home. “America’s safety isn’t
  negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always,” the US attorney general, Pam
  Bondi, wrote. Meanwhile, Patel’s deputy, Dan Bongino, reposted the director’s
  comments, adding that “public corruption will not be tolerated” and continuing
  the cryptic messaging around the details of the raid. The US attorney general,
  Pam Bondi, said that there have been 719 arrests in DC since the federal law
  enforcement surge in the nation’s capital began on 7 August. She added that 91
  illegal firearms have been seized by federal agents in the same period. Bondi
  said that on Thursday 21 August, federal law enforcement made 76 arrests,
  which included 36 by Ice agents. Some more pictures are coming through of FBI
  agents carrying empty cardboard boxes into John Bolton’s home in Bethesda,
  Maryland. The FBI search at John Bolton’s home in Bethesda is over whether the
  former national security adviser, and noted Trump adversary, kept or disclosed
  classified information, the New York Times is reporting. Looking ahead today,
  we’ll actually hear from Donald Trump at noon ET, when he makes an
  announcement in the Oval Office. On such a busy day of news, we can expect
  plenty of questions. We’ll bring you the latest as it gets under way. Earlier,
  the Associated Press reported that after the search on Bolton’s home started,
  he was seen standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an
  office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests. The AP
  also reported that Bolton left a few minutes after the conversation, and
  appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags
  into the office building through a back entrance. Earlier, Benjamin Wittes –
  the editor of Lawfare – was livestreaming on the street near John Bolton’s
  house in Maryland as FBI agents conducted their search. Wittes noted that “the
  statute of limitations is about to run out” – referring to the five-year time
  limit when it comes to prosecuting the disclosure or mishandling of classified
  documents (the crux of the Trump administration’s earlier lawsuit). But Wittes
  said it was unclear what exactly law enforcement are looking to recover, or
  the basis of the search warrant. We’re now seeing some pictures of John
  Bolton’s wife, Gretchen, outside their Maryland home this morning as FBI
  agents search the property. Bolton told CNN earlier that he was not home
  during the raid and was unaware it was taking place. The raid began at about
  7am ET and was first reported by the New York Post. CNN also reported the
  news, saying its reporters had observed FBI officers near Bolton’s residence
  in Maryland and further reporting that Bolton, when reached, said he was not
  at home during the raid, nor was he aware of the law enforcement activity. The
  FBI and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests from the
  Guardian for comment. A spokesperson for the FBI told the New York Times that
  agents were “conducting court-authorized activity in the area”. Meghan Hays,
  who was a White House special adviser to Joe Biden, told CNN in an interview
  that the raid “seems extremely political, extremely petty” and said it smacks
  of “pure revenge” on the part of Trump and “poor use of FBI resources”. Roger
  Stone, a longtime political operative who was prosecuted during the Russia
  investigation and later pardoned by Trump, posted on social media: Good
  morning. John Bolton. How does it feel to have your home raided at 6 o’clock
  in the morning? As we bring you more information about the reported FBI raid
  on John Bolton’s Maryland home, it’s worth pointing out that Bolton was
  stripped of his security clearance when Trump started his second term in
  office. The president also got rid of Bolton’s government detail, despite
  being the target of an assassination plot due to Bolton’s criticism of the
  Iranian regime. Bolton served as Trump’s third national security adviser in
  his first term in office, but has since become a vocal critic of the
  president. Less than an hour ago, a post from Bolton’s X account critiqued the
  state of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. “Russia has not changed its
  goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire,” he wrote. “Meanwhile, meetings
  will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don’t see these
  talks making any progress.” Bolton also published a memoir, ‘The Room Where it
  Happened’, detailing his time in Trump’s White House. He ultimately concluded
  that the president was not “fit for office”. A reminder that the Trump
  administration actually sued Bolton over his book back in 2020 – alleging that
  he didn’t follow the correct protocol to have it reviewed for classified
  information. However, in 2021, the justice department under Joe Biden closed
  the investigation, and Bolton was ultimately given a federal judge’s go-ahead
  to publish his book. The FBI raided the home of Donald Trump’s former national
  security adviser turned critic John Bolton on Friday morning, according to
  reports. The federal search of Bolton’s house in the Washington DC area was as
  part of an investigation involving the handling of classified documents, the
  Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed source. The FBI director, Kash
  Patel, posted a cryptic message on X on Friday morning, saying: “NO ONE is
  above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” The raid began around 7am ET and was
  first reported by the New York Post. More to follow as we get it. The Trump
  administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove
  governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of
  being bullied” into stepping down. Cook, who was appointed to the US central
  bank’s powerful board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused by Donald
  Trump’s officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are
  unconfirmed. The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the Fed’s
  independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge
  its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on
  Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is
  investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the
  case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from
  the Fed’s board. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your
  Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg
  News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is
  appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”
  The Fed declined to comment. The justice department declined to comment. The
  US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has repeatedly endorsed the Reformation
  Red Pill podcast, and has appeared on four episodes. But the former pastor who
  hosts the show, and who attends Hegseth’s theocratic church, has voiced a
  range of extreme positions in recent months on issues including Ice raids,
  capital punishment, the racist “great replacement” theory, adultery and
  neo-Nazism. The revelations come on top of recent media reports focused on
  Hegseth also boosting a video of Douglas Wilson and other Communion of
  Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) pastors arguing that women should lose
  the vote in the United States. They also follow previous revelations about
  Hegseth’s links to or apparent sympathies for Christian nationalist positions.
  Joshua Haymes is a member of the CREC-aligned Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship
  (PHRF), and his podcasts advocate for the CREC’s moral and theological
  positions. As the Guardian previously reported, he once served as a pastoral
  intern at the church. Online he has claimed that liberalism is a greater
  threat to the US than neo-Nazism, and that the Bible is “pro-Ice raids”. On X,
  he has also advocated for capital punishment for adultery and abortion, and
  appeared to call for the drowning of LGBTQ+ Pride marchers. In an emailed
  comment, Haymes clarified his current professional role. “I am not a pastoral
  intern. I have gone full-time into media and content creation. I am not
  employed by Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship,” he said. President Donald
  Trump’s administration is faltering in its aggressive pursuit of the death
  penalty as it revisits cases in which predecessors explicitly decided against
  seeking capital punishment, AP reports. Since taking office in February, U.S.
  Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized prosecutors to seek the death
  penalty against 19 people, including nine defendants in cases in which
  president Joe Biden’s administration had sought lesser sentences. But judges
  have blocked those reversal attempts for all but two defendants, most recently
  on Monday in a pair of cases in the US Virgin Islands, showing the limits of
  the Trump administration’s power to undo decisions in cases already well
  underway. In pursuing capital punishment, the Justice Department is seeking to
  follow through on a Trump campaign promise to resume federal executions after
  they were halted by Biden’s Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Republican
  president’s Justice Department has accused the previous Democratic
  administration of supplanting “the will of the people with their own personal
  beliefs” in failing to seek death sentences in many cases involving horrific
  crimes. Detailed opinions haven’t been issued in the most recent two cases,
  which involve a man accused of killing a police officer in 2022 and two men
  accused of armed robbery and murder in 2018. But other judges who have
  rejected reversal attempts on constitutional and procedural grounds were blunt
  in their assessment of the Trump administration’s approach. “The government
  has proceeded hastily in this case, and in doing so has leapfrogged important
  constitutional and statutory rights,” Trump appointee US judge Stephanie
  Gallagher in Maryland wrote in June, striking the notice of intent to seek the
  death penalty against three alleged MS-13 gang members accused of killing two
  teenage girls in 2020. “That is unacceptable.” The Trump administration has
  unilaterally stripped hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their union
  contracts after a federal appeals court overruled an injunction which halted
  the plans. It is just getting started, according to the White House. An
  executive order issued in March sought to cancel all collective bargaining
  agreements for most federal employees, citing national security concerns – and
  remove collective bargaining rights from more than a million workers. While
  unions including the American Federation of Government Employees launched
  legal action as they challenged the move, obtaining an injunction, this was in
  effect overruled earlier this month. Union contracts at the Department of
  Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of
  Agriculture have since been terminated. An estimated 400,000 have been
  affected, about 2.6% of unionized workers in the US. “I think that what this
  administration is doing is trying us as a test bed. If they are successful, I
  do believe that they’ll be coming after every labor organization in the US,”
  Everett Kelley, president of the AFGE, the largest federal labor union in the
  US, told the Guardian. “This is a fight for the very democracy of this
  country. This is a fight for every worker in America. “If Trump is successful
  in dismantling AFGE, there’s nothing to stop him from coming after every labor
  organization in the country, and we believe he will.” The US vice-president,
  JD Vance, previewed in Georgia on Thursday the lines of attack candidates will
  use to defend the president’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the
  midterms next year, calling it “the biggest tax cut for families that this
  country has ever seen”. Vance touted an increase in the child tax credit, the
  elimination of taxes on overtime and on tips in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
  while speaking in a warehouse for ATLA Refrigeration in Peachtree City,
  Georgia. Vance did not mention that only the first $25,000 of tips will be tax
  free and will require itemization to claim, something few service workers do
  because the standard deduction usually provides a larger benefit. Eliminating
  overtime taxes also applies to the first $12,500 of a filer’s overtime income,
  phasing out at $150,000 of income. The increase in the child tax credit is
  $200 a child under 17 to $2,200, which will now be indexed to inflation. The
  event also served as a preview of the attacks Jon Ossof, the Georgia
  Democratic senator, will face in the bruising swing state battle to come next
  year. The White House paired Vance’s appearance with an information blitz on
  the “working families” tax cut. Ossoff would come to regret voting against the
  bill, Vance said. “In about a year, you are not going to be able to turn on
  the television without Senator John Ossoff pretending that he supported the
  working families tax cut, when in reality he voted against them,” Vance said.
  California voters will decide in November whether to approve a redrawn
  congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more US House seats next
  year, after Texas Republicans advanced their own redrawn map to pad their
  House majority by the same number of seats at president Donald Trump’s urging.
  California lawmakers voted mostly along party lines Thursday to approve
  legislation calling for the special election. Democratic governor Gavin
  Newsom, who has led the campaign in favor of the map, then quickly signed it –
  the latest step in a tit-for-tat gerrymandering battle, AP reported. “This is
  not something six weeks ago that I ever imagined that I’d be doing,” Newsom
  said at a press conference, pledging a campaign for the measure that would
  reach out to Democrats, Republicans and independent voters. “This is a
  reaction to an assault on our democracy in Texas.” Republicans, who have filed
  a lawsuit and called for a federal investigation into the plan, promised to
  fight the measure at the ballot box as well. California Assemblyman James
  Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, said Trump was “wrong” to push for
  new Republican seats elsewhere, contending the president was just responding
  to Democratic gerrymandering in other states. But he warned that Newsom’s
  approach, which the governor has dubbed “fight fire with fire,” was dangerous.
  “You move forward fighting fire with fire and what happens?” Gallagher asked.
  “You burn it all down.” Texas’ redrawn maps still need a final vote in the
  Republican-controlled state Senate, which advanced the plan out of a committee
  Thursday but did not bring the measure to the floor. The Senate was scheduled
  to meet again Friday. Environmental groups have welcomed the ordered closure
  of the Trump administration’s notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail
  within 60 days. In her 82-page order, published in the US district court’s
  southern district of Florida on Friday, judge Kathleen Williams determined the
  facility was causing severe and irreparable damage to the fragile Florida
  Everglades. The shock ruling by district court judge Kathleen Williams builds
  on a temporary restraining order she issued two weeks ago halting further
  construction work at the remote tented camp, which has attracted waves of
  criticism for harsh conditions, abuse of detainees and denial of due process
  as they await deportation. “This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and
  countless Americans who believe this imperilled wilderness should be
  protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of
  the Everglades, which mounted the legal challenge. “It sends a clear message
  that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of
  our government - and there are consequences for ignoring them”. Judge Williams
  also ruled that no more detainees were to be brought to the facility while it
  was being wound down. She also noted that a plan to develop the site on which
  the jail was built into a massive tourist airport was rejected in the 1960s
  because of the harm it would have caused the the land and delicate ecosystem.
  “Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless
  local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly
  pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and
  protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This order does nothing more than
  uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those
  promises.” No further construction at the site can take place, she ruled, and
  there must be no further increase in the number of detainees currently held
  there, estimated to be about 700. After the 60-day period, all construction
  materials, fencing, generators and fixtures that made the site a detention
  camp must be removed. Read my colleague Richard Luscombe’s latest report here:
  Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be
  bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with
  news that the Trump administration has been accused of wanting to “proactively
  conduct reviews of social media posts and revoke visas based not on conduct
  but speech”. It comes as the state department said it was reviewing the
  records of more than 55 million US visa holders for potential revocation or
  deportable violations of immigration rules, in a significant expansion of
  Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. David J Bier, the director of
  immigration policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in
  DC, told the Washington Post: I doubt that’s feasible for everyone, but I
  suspect that these reviews will be done in a discriminatory manner targeting
  immigrants with certain backgrounds and in certain visa categories or specific
  people they want an excuse to revoke. In a move first reported by the
  Associated Press, the state department said that all of the foreigners who
  currently hold valid US visas are subject to “continuous vetting” for any
  indication that they could be ineligible for the document, including those
  already admitted into the country. Should such evidence come to light, the
  visa would be revoked and, if the visa holder were in the United States, they
  would be subject to deportation. “We are gathering more information than
  ever,” a senior state department official told the Washington Post, admitting
  it was likely that social media vetting would add more time to the review
  process. It follows an announcement by the Trump administration on Tuesday
  that it will look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when
  assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States. US
  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which handles requests to stay
  in the US or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social
  media postings of applicants and that “reviews for anti-American activity will
  be added to that vetting”. Read our latest report here: In other developments:
  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a law to hold a special election
  in November in which voters will be asked to approve a new congressional map,
  tilted in favor of Democrats, for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, if Texas
  goes ahead with a plan to do the same for Republicans. Donald Trump ventured
  from the White House in his motorcade through the not all that mean streets of
  Washington DC to deliver pizza and hamburgers to law enforcement officers and
  National Guard troops, and regale them with his plans to upgrade the grass in
  the district to make it look more like one of his golf courses. “I know more
  about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world”, the
  commander-in-chief told the officers. A federal judge ruled that Trump’s
  former lawyer and campaign surrogate, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving
  as the the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. A New York state appeals
  court tossed out a half-billion-dollar penalty that Trump had been ordered to
  pay after a judge found the president fraudulently overstated the value of his
  properties and other assets to bolster his family business. Despite the
  president falsely claiming the ruling to be a “total victory”, the five-judge
  panel let the lower court’s fraud verdict stand, which paves the way for New
  York attorney general Letitia James to appeal the decision to the state’s
  highest court. The Trump administration ratcheted up pressure on the Federal
  Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no
  intention of being bullied” into stepping down.

Our live coverage is ending for the day. Thanks for reading along with us. Here is a summary of the key developments from today: The Texas legislature preliminarily approved a redrawn congressional map on Friday that gives Republicans a chance to pick up as many as five congressional seats, fulfilling a brazen political request from Donald Trump to shore up the GOP’s standing before next year’s midterm elections. The tentative map adoption passed in an 18-11 party-line vote. To get final approval, the state legislature’s upper chamber will take a vote, which is forecasted to happen this weekend, the Texas Tribune reports. However, a Houston Democratic state senator has plans to delay the final passage. More here. The US Department of Justice has released the transcript and audio recording of an interview conducted by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, with the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In a post on X, Blanche said the materials were being released “in the interest of transparency”, providing links to the transcript and to audio files. The release includes documentation from a two-day interview conducted on 24 and 25 July. The materials comprise redacted transcripts for both days, along with multiple audio recordings – seven separate parts plus test recordings for day one, and four parts plus test recordings for day two. More here. The FBI raided the home of Donald Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic John Bolton early on Friday morning and later also turned up at Bolton’s office. The federal search of Bolton’s house in the Washington DC area was understood to be part of an investigation involving the handling of classified documents, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. A government source confirmed the raid to the Guardian, but did not disclose further details. More here. Donald Trump has threatened to take his federal crackdown on crime and city cleanliness to New York and Chicago, as the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, ordered that national guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington DC under federal control will now be armed. The US president talked to reporters in the Oval Office and said: “When ready, we will start in Chicago … Chicago is a mess.” He added that then the administration “will help with New York”, amid the controversial and aggressive federal efforts to control leading Democratic-voting cities, each of which has a Black mayor. More here. The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has fired a general whose agency’s initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from US strikes angered Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official. Lt Gen Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The firing is the latest upheaval in the US military and intelligence agencies, and comes a few months after details of the preliminary assessment leaked to the media. More here. Kilmar Ábrego García has been freed on Friday from criminal custody in Tennessee so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges, after a court ordered his release. Magistrate judge Barbara Holmes issued an order allowing the father of two to leave custody for the first time since his return to the US in June, following his wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. In a statement following his release, Ábrego’s lawyer, Sean Hecker said: “Today, Kilmar Ábrego García is free. More here. Canada will drop its counter-tariffs on some American goods in the coming days, Mark Carney has said, as the country’s prime minister looks to end a protracted trade war with longtime ally the United States. From 1 September, the Canadian government will remove some levies on US goods that comply with the North American free-trade pact, a move meant to “match” how the White House treated Canadian goods. Levies on steel, aluminum and autos will remain in place. The announcement comes one day after Carney and Donald Trump spoke on the phone. More here. The Trump administration on Friday ordered all construction to stop on Revolution Wind, a $4bn offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. The project, developed by the Danish company Orsted, had secured all necessary permits under the Biden administration and was expected to power more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring. “The project is 80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed,” Orsted said in a statement. The company said it is “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously”. “In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests in the United States,” Bureau of Ocean Energy Management acting director, Matthew Giacona, said in a letter. He said that the company “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project. The transcript of the interview between deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, and Ghislaine Maxwell show that he asked the convicted sex trafficker about her and Epstein’s interactions with a spate of prominent Democrats, including former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. Maxwell did not implicate any of those individuals in wrongdoing. Maxwell said she worked with Bill Clinton on his philanthropic endeavors, and that he used Epstein’s plane for a trip to Africa. But she said Clinton never visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein was accused of abusing some girls. The Texas legislature preliminarily approved a redrawn congressional map on Friday that gives Republicans a chance to pick up as many as five congressional seats, fulfilling a brazen political request from Donald Trump to shore up the GOP’s standing before next year’s midterm elections. The tentative map adoption passed in an 18-11 party-line vote. To get final approval, the state legislature’s upper chamber will take a vote, which is forecasted to happen this weekend, the Texas Tribune reports. However, a Houston Democratic state senator has plans to delay the final passage. Senator Carol Alvarado revealed her filibuster plans in a post on social media. “Republicans think they can walk all over us. Today I’m going to kick back,” Alvarado’s post read. “I’ve submitted my intention to filibuster the new congressional maps. Going to be a long night.” The Guardian’s Sam Levine has the full story: Vice-president JD Vance said the FBI raids on former national security adviser John Bolton’s home and office were part of a legal process, not a political one against the now harsh critic of Donald Trump. “We’re in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton. I will say we’re going to let that investigation proceed,” Vance said in an interview with MSNBC’s Meet the Press. “What I can tell you is that, unlike the Biden DOJ and the Biden FBI, our law enforcement agencies are going to be driven by law and not by politics,” he added. “And so, if we think that Ambassador Bolton has committed a crime, of course, eventually prosecutions will come.” The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has moved to strip thousands of federal health agency employees of their collective bargaining rights, according to a union that called the effort illegal. HHS officials confirmed Friday that the department is ending its recognition of unions for a number of employees and reclaiming office space and equipment that had been used for union activities. It’s the latest move by the Trump administration to put an end to collective bargaining with unions that represent federal employees. Previously affected agencies include the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In May, an appeals court said the administration could move forward with Donald Trump’s executive order that the president aimed at ending collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of federal employees while a lawsuit plays out. “This action ensures that HHS resources and personnel are fully focused on safeguarding the health and security of the American people,” department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Read the full story here: It looks like more defense officials were fired, shortly after we reported today that defense secretary Pete Hegseth dismissed Lt Gen Jeffrey A Kruse, who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. The Associated Press is reporting that V Adm Nancy Lacore, who was chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as R Adm Milton Sands, a navy SEAL officer who oversaw Naval Special Warfare Command, were also fired. The reasons for their firings, the latest in a series of steps targeting military leaders, were not clear Friday. Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell said Hillary Clinton did not associate with Jeffrey Epstein, according to the recently-released transcripts of an interview conducted by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, with Maxwell. When Maxwell was asked if Epstein “knew or had any sort of visit, dealings or associated with Hillary Clinton,” Maxwell responded, “I would say no.” “Did you ever see them together?,” asked Blanche. Maxwell responded “No.” Maxwell was also asked whether Epstein ever did any business with the Clintons. She said he may have given money to their foundation. “I think he did do that. And that, I believe, the money that he may have given could have been independent of me,” Maxwell said. The Guardian’s Lauren Aratani brings us her analysis of Donald Trump’s push for steeper rate cuts and the Fed’s reality: Stocks soared on Friday following the strongest signal yet that US the Federal Reserve is gearing up to start cutting interest rates again this fall. But how long can this celebration last? While Wall Street cheered the biggest headline from the speech by the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, Powell also delivered a reality check on where interest rates could settle in the longer term. “We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s,” said Powell. In other words: even if the Fed does start cutting interest rates again this year, they may not fall back to their pre-pandemic levels. It’s a signal, despite the short-term optimism on potential rate cuts, that the Fed’s long-term outlook is more unstable. “Markets might be ahead of their skis on how aggressive the Fed is going to be in reducing interest rates, because the neutral rate might be higher than some believe,” Ryan Sweet, an economist at Oxford Economics, said. Higher rates means borrowing money for loans, such as mortgages, will be more expensive. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was just under 3% in 2021, when interest rates were near zero. Now the average mortgage rate is closer to 6.7%. Paired with home prices at near-record highs, elevated mortgages mean many Americans will continue to struggle to purchase a home. Although Trump has been pushing the Fed for months to decrease rates to 1%, claiming that Powell is “hurting the housing industry very badly”, it seems unlikely that rates will return to such a level any time soon. The Fed is trying to achieve a Goldilocks balance. Rates that are too high risk unemployment, while rates that are too low could mean higher inflation. Policymakers are searching for a “neutral” level, where everything is just right. Read the full analysis here: The US government has taken an unprecedented 10% stake in Intel in a deal with the struggling chipmaker and is planning more such moves, according to Donald Trump and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, the latest extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate America. Lutnick wrote on X: “BIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies. Thanks to Intel CEO @LipBuTan1 for striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.” Trump met with Lip-Bu Tan on Friday and posed for a photo with Lutnick. The development follows a meeting between Tan and Trump earlier this month that was sparked by the US president’s demand for the Intel chief’s resignation over his ties to Chinese firms. Here’s the full story: The Internal Revenue Service has halted planned layoffs and is offering jobs back to some employees who previously took the so-called “fork in the road” that encouraged staffers to take a buyout as the agency scrambles to boost staffing ahead of tax season, Axios reports. The so-called “department of government efficiency’s” (Doge) early days made headlines for targeting government workers with layoffs and pushing others to resign. But the IRS is now reversing course, joining other federal agencies, either rehiring terminated workers or pulling back on “reduction in force” plans. In February, the IRS laid off roughly 7,000 workers in Washington and around the country. Donald Trump announced that he named Sergio Gor to be the next US ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs, according to a post on Truth Social. Gor is currently the director of the White House presidential personnel office, and is slated to remain in that position until his confirmation. “For the most populous Region in the World, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my Agenda and help us, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” Trump wrote on Friday. Carol Alvarado, a Texas Democratic senator from Houston, says she intends to filibuster tonight in the Texas senate to delay Republicans from passing a redrawn congressional map. “Republicans think they can walk all over us. Today I’m going to kick back. I’ve submitted my intention to filibuster the new congressional maps. Going to be a long night,” she wrote in a post on X, accompanied by a picture of sneakers. Democrats have gone back and forth with Phil King, the bill’s GOP sponsor, since this morning, trying to get him to admit that he considered race in drawing the maps. The local television station KVUE has more on the rules Alvarado will have to follow as she filibusters the new congressional map. Alvarado will not be able to eat or drink and must stand at her desk the whole time without breaks for the bathroom, the outlet reported. The national guard personnel deployed on the streets of Washington DC will now be armed, a defense official confirmed to The Guardian. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the nearly 2,000 of the national guard members to carry “service-issued weapons,” the official said. “The Interim Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard retains the authority to make any necessary force posture adjustments in coordination with the D.C. Metropolitan Police and Federal law enforcement partners,” said the defense official. The Pentagon and the US army had said last week that troops would not carry weapons. In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump announced that his administration is undergoing a “major tariff investigation” into imported furniture and is expected to release its findings within 50 days. Trump said the US will impose tariffs (at a rate still to be determined) on foreign-made furniture, in efforts to revive the industry in states including North Carolina, South Carolina, and Michigan. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth fired Lt Gen Jeffrey A Kruse, the military’s top intelligence officer. The Washington Post first reported the story. Kruse, who served as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, is the second senior Air Force general in a week to be forced out or retire unexpectedly. On Monday, Air Force chief of staff Gen David Allvin announced he was stepping down after just two years in the role, a position typically held for four years. A spokesperson for the DIA told CBS News that deputy director Christine Bordine will assume the role of acting director “effective immediately.” “The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,” said senator Mark Warner, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, in a statement. The firing comes a few months after details of the agency’s preliminary assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from US strikes leaked to the media. It found that Iran’s nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the US strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The transcripts are more than 300 pages, but here it goes … Blanche said, on record, that their conversation wasn’t “promising to do anything” for Maxwell. But that anything she said couldn’t be used against her, unless she provided false statements or there was a retrial in her case. According to Maxwell, Epstein didn’t have any video or photographic evidence of any high-profile individuals committing sexual offences. And to that point, Maxwell said she didn’t hear or witness any instances of Epstein blackmailing powerful people. Maxwell recruited a number of masseuses for Epstein but “never checked their age or credentials”. She added that, throughout her time with Epstein, she never heard any examples of “sexually inappropriate contact” between Epstein’s guests and in-house masseuses. Despite her claims that Epstein didn’t extort anyone, Maxwell does not believe that Epstein died by suicide. She chalked that up to “mismanagement” at the bureau of prisons. In the interview Maxwell said she does believe that Epstein “did a lot of, not all, but some of what he’s accused of”. But she maintains that “he became that man over a period of time”. Maxwell said that she “never” saw Donald Trump receive a massage. She also said that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” adding that he was “a gentleman in all respects” whenever she saw the president. Maxwell also didn’t recall former president Bill Clinton receiving a massage while travelling with Epstein. One notable point is that Maxwell denied ever recruiting masseuses from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. “I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember. I can’t ever recollect doing that,” she told Todd Blanche. A reminder that Trump claimed his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein stemmed from the convicted sex offender’s efforts to hire workers away from Trump’s Florida club. Maxwell did not remember whether Trump submitted a letter for Epstein’s 50th birthday album, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. She also couldn’t remember asking Trump to contribute. In Ghislaine Maxwell’s first interview with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, on 24 July, she said that she “may have met” Donald Trump in 1990, before meeting Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell went on to describe the relationship between the president and Epstein as “friendly”, although she didn’t know how the two men met or how they became friends. She added that she “never” saw the president receive a massage: I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects. Maxwell also contested Trump’s claims she recruited masseuses from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. “I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember. I can’t ever recollect doing that,” she said in the interview with Blanche. A reminder that the president said in July that his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein stemmed from the convicted sex offender’s efforts to hire workers away from Trump’s Florida club. “People were taken out of the spa, hired by him, in other words, gone,” the president said. The Department of Justice has released the transcripts and audio recordings of the interviews between Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of child sex-offender Jefrrey Epstein, and the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. The interviews between Blanche and Maxwell took place on 24 and 25 July 2025, with her legal representatives present. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking. The justice department will also send the first tranche of records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation to the House oversight committee, after receiving a subpoena for the files. Earlier this week, the committee chair, Representative James Comer, a Republican, said that his aim is to make the files public – while protecting the safety and identities of the victims. A court has ordered the release of Kilmar Ábrego García from criminal custody in Tennessee. On Friday, magistrate judge Barbara Holmes issued an order allowing the Maryland father of two to leave custody for the first time since his return to the US in June, after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. The 30-year-old was initially wrongfully deported by federal immigration officials in March. According to the Trump administration, Ábrego was affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny. During his detention at El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured, according to court documents filed by his lawyers in July. Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, the Trump administration faced widespread pressure to return him back to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return. In June, the Trump administration returned Ábrego from El Salvador, only to hit him with a slew of human smuggling charges, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January. An update from the Texas senate, where Molly Cook, a Democratic lawmaker from Houston, is now questioning Phil King about the new Texas map. Her line of questioning appears designed to highlight that the senator is not completely blind to race in Texas. She points out that he’s likely done polling in his own races that breaks down results by race and has analysed other statewide racial data as part of his job as a legislator. “I have not drilled into racial data with regard to redistricting,” King says. When asked about the ongoing discussions about a possible bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president said it will be “interesting to see” whether that goes ahead. Earlier he explained his decision to let the two leaders have a meeting together: “I could have been at the meeting, but a lot of people think that nothing’s going to come out of that meeting.” Trump went on to say that he’ll know “one way or the other” about his next steps in two weeks. “It’s going to be a very important decision. And that’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs, or both, or do we do nothing and say ‘it’s your fight,’” he said. Earlier the president said he was “not happy” when asked about a US factory being hit during a Russian strike in Ukraine. The president just confirmed that he has spoken with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate majority leader, John Thune, about a plan to raise $2bn from Congress to help fund his ‘beautification’ plans for DC. “I think it’s going to be very easy to get it’s going to be not a lot of money. I wouldn’t even know where to spend the number that you mentioned, but it’s going to be money to beautify the city,” he said in response to a reporter’s question in the Oval Office. “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. I thought it was a sleazebag, actually, and he suffers major Trump derangement syndrome,” the president said, speaking about the raid on his former national security adviser’s home. Trump repeated that he tries to “stay out of that stuff”, and that when it came to the search of Bolton’s home, he “purposefully” didn’t want to get involved. “I saw that just like everybody else,” he added. The president then spent time talking about how he too was subjected to a raid, referring to the FBI search of the his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 during an investigation into the handling of presidential and classified documents. “They went through everything you can imagine,” Trump said. The president just shared a picture of himself and Vladimir Putin at their summit last week in Alaska. Trump even hinted that Putin may attend the 2026 World Cup in the US. “I believe he will be coming, depending on what happens, he may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens,” he said. The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, has gifted Donald Trump the first ticket to the 2026 World Cup’s final match. In between repeating baseless claims that DC crime data is “phoney”, and touting the work of the National Guard in the nation’s capital, the president says that he’s willing to bring in the “regular military” to the nation’s capital if needed. He also repeated his threats to send the military to cities in blue states, singling out Chicago today: Chicago is a mess. You have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent, and we’ll straighten that one out probably next. That’ll be our next one after this, and it won’t even be tough. The president is now speaking in the Oval Office, joined by JD Vance. He says that the 2026 World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center on 5 December, which will determine the match schedule. The US is one of three host countries for the tournament. “This will drive more than $30bn in US economy and create 185,000 American jobs. No sporting event attracts more attention, or more fans, or anything else. I just look forward to the draw,” Trump said. The vice-president, JD Vance, has said that the FBI raid and investigation into former national security adviser John Bolton is not because he’s a critic of the president, according to an interview with NBC News. “We don’t think that we should throw people – even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically – you shouldn’t throw people willy-nilly in prison. You should let the law drive these determinations, and that’s what we’re doing,” Vance told NBC anchor Kristen Welker. The Texas senate is taking a brief recess amid questions about the state’s new congressional map. State senator Phil King, the bill’s sponsor, has been taking questions for about an hour and a half from Democrats. In nearly all of their questions, Democrats have asked King questions about the racial makeup of the new districts. King has essentially said the same thing over and over – he did not consider racial data when looking at the map and the primary purpose why districts look the way they do is to benefit Republicans. King has also conceded that he did not draw the maps himself and has been a lot more circumspect about what data mapmakers looked at when they drew lines. The reason King is answering this way is because any concession that racial data was used would be a significant tool Democrats would use in expected legal fights ahead to argue that the new maps diminish the influence of minority voters in the state. The FBI raided the home of Donald Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic John Bolton on Friday morning. A government source confirmed the raid to the Guardian, but didn’t provide additional details. The search of Bolton’s house in Maryland was part of an investigation involving the handling of classified documents, according to various reports. Bolton was not at home during the raid, and said he did not know it was happening, according to CNN. Agents later began a search of his DC office, a source told the outlet. For his part, the president said that he wasn’t briefed on the raid when speaking to reporters earlier. He added that he expects more details to come from the justice department. “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s a real sort of a lowlife,” Trump said of his one-time cabinet official turned adversary. “He’s not a smart guy. But he could be a very unpatriotic. I’m going to find out.” The president also spent time extolling the fact there have been no murders in the nation’s capital in the last week.“That’s the first time in anybody’s memory that you haven’t had a murder in a week,” he said. However, the city last experienced no homicides (over a seven-day period) as recently as July this year, according to DC police data. In that same impromptu press conference, Trump also said that he will fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the US central bank. At the same time, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, nodded to a possible rate cut at the central bank’s September meeting. However, Powell stopped short of committing to cutting rates next month during a speech to policymakers and economists at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference. Meanwhile, beyond DC, the Texas senate has begun final deliberations to pass its redrawn congressional map. The plan, which is expected to pass this afternoon, could net five congressional seats for Republicans in 2026. Police officers from around Georgia, and around the country, gathered on Friday morning at the First Baptist Church of Atlanta for a memorial service for police officer David Rose, who was killed on 8 August while fending off a gunman at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) headquarters. “David Rose was a man whose life was defined by service,” said interim police chief David Padrick, noting his service in the Marine Corps before joining the county police force. “David was more than a co-worker. He was family.” Rose was his class leader in the police academy, from which he graduated only six months before his death. “As the class leader, you are expected to lead from the front and not the rear,” said sergeant Trey Jones, his instructor. “He carried himself with a calm presence and a clear sense of purpose … He was unshakable.” Rose’s death has been met with a wide outpouring of grief in Atlanta. He was the father of two children. His wife is pregnant. About 500 police officers filled the sanctuary. Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, attended, as did officers from as far away as New York City and Aurora, Colorado. Many CDC employees also attended the memorial. Their grief was matched by fury at the Trump administration, which many said had been insufficiently supportive since the shooting, if not tacitly encouraging the anti-vaccine sentiment which drew the shooter to their door. One remarkable thing evident from watching Texas state senator Phil King’s testimony about the state’s new congressional map is the way he openly says the map is being redrawn for partisan purposes. “HB 4, I believe, should elect more Republicans to the US Congress,” King said. This is an admission that would only be made behind closed doors a decade ago. But in 2019, the US supreme court said that federal courts could do nothing to stop gerrymandering for partisan purposes. That is a huge boon for lawmakers. Since they are still prohibited from drawing lines based on race, they can get some legal protection by simply saying they are going to draw districts for partisan purposes. Lawmakers are betting that there will be no blowback from voting for openly admitting that they are doing this for partisan gain. Of course, the risk is also quite limited since they are in districts already drawn to virtually guarantee their re-election. Texas state senator Phil King, the sponsor of the bill to enact the redrawn congressional map, is taking questions from Democrats in the Texas senate about the new map. Democrats are asking questions about how the map was made that can be used in expected court challenges to the map. King knows this and is using his remarks on the floor to try to immunize the map from future challenges. To bolster that effort, he’s insisting over and over again that he did not consider race or look at racial data when drawing the map. “I also want you to know, and I can’t emphasize this enough, that I have not reviewed any racial data,” he said at the outset of his remarks. The US supreme court has said that lawmakers are entitled to a “good faith” presumption in drawing maps, so Republicans will get a lot of leeway as long as they don’t openly admit to considering race. The Texas senate has begun final deliberations to pass its redrawn congressional map. The plan, which is expected to pass this afternoon, would add as many as five congressional seats. The Texas house of representatives passed the measure earlier this week. Republicans currently represent 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats. They could win as many as 30 seats under the new plan. As we’ve been reporting this morning, FBI agents have searched the home of John Bolton, a former adviser to Donald Trump turned persistent critic, this morning in what a source familiar with the matter told Reuters was part of a national security inquiry. The investigation is focused on the potential criminal release of classified information, the source added. An FBI spokesperson confirmed “court-authorized activity” in the area of Bolton’s home in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, and also confirmed law enforcement activity at Bolton’s Washington DC office, earlier reported by CNN. Speaking to reporters during a museum visit in Washington DC earlier this morning, Donald Trump said that he will fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the US central bank. What she did was bad. So I’ll fire her if she doesn’t resign. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, has said she had “no intention of being bullied to step down” after Trump on Wednesday called for her resignation on the basis of allegations about mortgages she holds in Michigan and Georgia. The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, that the case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the board. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.” Cook is among three Fed governors appointed by former president Joe Biden whose terms extend beyond Trump’s time in office, complicating the president’s efforts to gain more control by appointing a majority of the seven-member board of governors. Two of the remaining six board members were appointed by Trump – governor Christopher Waller and vice-chair for supervision Michelle Bowman. The president is planning to announce today that the 2026 World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington this December, NBC News is reporting, citing a White House official. The announcement combines Trump’s enthusiasm for the World Cup and his cultural realignment of the Kennedy Center. We’ll bring you more on that as it comes later. The US deputy treasury secretary, Michael Faulkender, is leaving the Trump administration less than five months after being confirmed by the Senate, the treasury department said. Faulkender is the second Senate-confirmed official to leave the department this month, after the departure of IRS commissioner Billy Long, who said he was being tapped as ambassador to Iceland. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, thanked Faulkender for his work at the department but gave no reason for his departure. Trump nominated Faulkender, a University of Maryland finance professor, in December to serve as the No 2 official at the treasury, where he had been assistant secretary of economic policy during Trump’s first term. He was confirmed by the Senate for the role on 26 March. At the end of the first Trump administration, Faulkender had returned to the University of Maryland’s Robert H Smith School of Business, where he has been a finance professor since 2008. He had also served as the chief economist for two years at the America First Policy Institute, a conservative thinktank that has helped shape Trump’s policy agenda. The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has repeatedly endorsed the Reformation Red Pill podcast, and has appeared on four episodes. But the former pastor who hosts the show, and who attends Hegseth’s theocratic church, has voiced a range of extreme positions in recent months on issues including Ice raids, capital punishment, the racist “great replacement” theory, adultery and neo-Nazism. The revelations come on top of recent media reports focused on Hegseth also boosting a video of Douglas Wilson and other Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) pastors arguing that women should lose the vote in the United States. They also follow previous revelations about Hegseth’s links to or apparent sympathies for Christian nationalist positions. Joshua Haymes is a member of the CREC-aligned Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship (PHRF), and his podcasts advocate for the CREC’s moral and theological positions. As the Guardian previously reported, he once served as a pastoral intern at the church. Online he has claimed that liberalism is a greater threat to the US than neo-Nazism, and that the Bible is “pro-Ice raids”. On X, he has also advocated for capital punishment for adultery and abortion, and appeared to call for the drowning of LGBTQ+ Pride marchers. Despite distancing himself from the PHRF, Haymes regularly hosts Brooks Potteiger, the congregation’s pastor and Hegseth’s closest spiritual adviser. Potteiger’s most recent appearance was just over a week ago. Pottiger appears alongside Haymes in the profile image for the podcast’s channel on YouTube, whose description reads: “We created this podcast as a resource to serve you in your reformation red pill journey.” These materials, mostly published since Hegseth was confirmed as secretary of defense, underline the extreme Christian nationalist positions at Pilgrim Hill, in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, the community within which Hegseth acquired an 8,800 sq ft, $3.4m mansion in 2022. The Guardian repeatedly sent requests for comment to Hegseth via the Pentagon’s centralized communications office. A Pentagon spokesman offered a link to a transcript of a 14 August press conference in which Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters Hegseth “is a proud member of a church that is affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson. He is a very proud Christian and has those traditional Christian viewpoints.” Donald Trump has confirmed a Guardian report that he wants Russia and Ukraine to meet in a bilat before he intervenes again, although he acknowledged he might have to get involved. We’re going to see Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together. It’s like oil and vinegar. They don’t get along too well, for obvious reasons. And then we’ll see whether or not I would have to be there. I’d rather not. I’d rather have them have a meeting and see how they can do. The FBI is now reportedly searching John Bolton’s DC office, a source tells CNN. This comes after our earlier post about Bolton speaking with agents in the lobby of the office building, according to the Associated Press. Speaking to reporters earlier, the president praised the fact there have been no murders in the nation’s capital in the last week. “DC was a hellhole, and now it’s safe,” Trump said. “That’s the first time in anybody’s memory that you haven’t had a murder in a week.” However, DC police data shows that the city last experienced no homicides (over a seven-day period) as recently as July this year. Specifically between 12 and 19 of July. There have been several similar stretches earlier this year, lasting a week or more, without murders in DC. The president has routinely claimed, without evidence, that DC officials have manipulated crime data. Signalling that the Federal Reserve could restart interest rate cuts, the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell, said the US economy had “faced new challenges” over the past year. Focusing on inflation, Powell said Trump’s tariffs had “begun to push up prices in some categories of goods”. He added he expected the effects of tariffs to “accumulate over the coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts”. Powell also said: “Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labour force growth.” Some of the changes to tax, spending and regulatory policies brought in by the Trump White House could also have “important implications for economic growth and productivity”, he said. Changes in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. Powell’s speech did not mention the political pressure he, and the Fed, have been under in recent months, after Trump repeatedly threatened to fire him, which has raised questions over the independence of the central bank. Instead, he repeatedly mentioned the Federal Reserve’s mandate “to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people” and said the central bank remained “fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate”. The president said he wasn’t briefed on the raid on John Bolton’s home, while making an impromptu visit to the People’s House exhibit near the White House. Sporting a “Trump was right about everything” hat, the president said that he saw the news of the raid on television earlier. “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s a real sort of a lowlife,” Trump said. “He’s not a smart guy. But he could be a very unpatriotic. I’m going to find out.” The president added that he expects to find out details of the search from the justice department later. “I tell the group I don’t want to know, but just you have to do what you have to do. I don’t want to know about it.” Over the last couple of hours, key leaders in the justice department have co-signed FBI director Kash Patel’s minatory post on X as agents searched John Bolton’s Maryland home. “America’s safety isn’t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always,” the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, wrote. Meanwhile, Patel’s deputy, Dan Bongino, reposted the director’s comments, adding that “public corruption will not be tolerated” and continuing the cryptic messaging around the details of the raid. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said that there have been 719 arrests in DC since the federal law enforcement surge in the nation’s capital began on 7 August. She added that 91 illegal firearms have been seized by federal agents in the same period. Bondi said that on Thursday 21 August, federal law enforcement made 76 arrests, which included 36 by Ice agents. Some more pictures are coming through of FBI agents carrying empty cardboard boxes into John Bolton’s home in Bethesda, Maryland. The FBI search at John Bolton’s home in Bethesda is over whether the former national security adviser, and noted Trump adversary, kept or disclosed classified information, the New York Times is reporting. Looking ahead today, we’ll actually hear from Donald Trump at noon ET, when he makes an announcement in the Oval Office. On such a busy day of news, we can expect plenty of questions. We’ll bring you the latest as it gets under way. Earlier, the Associated Press reported that after the search on Bolton’s home started, he was seen standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests. The AP also reported that Bolton left a few minutes after the conversation, and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance. Earlier, Benjamin Wittes – the editor of Lawfare – was livestreaming on the street near John Bolton’s house in Maryland as FBI agents conducted their search. Wittes noted that “the statute of limitations is about to run out” – referring to the five-year time limit when it comes to prosecuting the disclosure or mishandling of classified documents (the crux of the Trump administration’s earlier lawsuit). But Wittes said it was unclear what exactly law enforcement are looking to recover, or the basis of the search warrant. We’re now seeing some pictures of John Bolton’s wife, Gretchen, outside their Maryland home this morning as FBI agents search the property. Bolton told CNN earlier that he was not home during the raid and was unaware it was taking place. The raid began at about 7am ET and was first reported by the New York Post. CNN also reported the news, saying its reporters had observed FBI officers near Bolton’s residence in Maryland and further reporting that Bolton, when reached, said he was not at home during the raid, nor was he aware of the law enforcement activity. The FBI and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests from the Guardian for comment. A spokesperson for the FBI told the New York Times that agents were “conducting court-authorized activity in the area”. Meghan Hays, who was a White House special adviser to Joe Biden, told CNN in an interview that the raid “seems extremely political, extremely petty” and said it smacks of “pure revenge” on the part of Trump and “poor use of FBI resources”. Roger Stone, a longtime political operative who was prosecuted during the Russia investigation and later pardoned by Trump, posted on social media: Good morning. John Bolton. How does it feel to have your home raided at 6 o’clock in the morning? As we bring you more information about the reported FBI raid on John Bolton’s Maryland home, it’s worth pointing out that Bolton was stripped of his security clearance when Trump started his second term in office. The president also got rid of Bolton’s government detail, despite being the target of an assassination plot due to Bolton’s criticism of the Iranian regime. Bolton served as Trump’s third national security adviser in his first term in office, but has since become a vocal critic of the president. Less than an hour ago, a post from Bolton’s X account critiqued the state of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. “Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire,” he wrote. “Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don’t see these talks making any progress.” Bolton also published a memoir, ‘The Room Where it Happened’, detailing his time in Trump’s White House. He ultimately concluded that the president was not “fit for office”. A reminder that the Trump administration actually sued Bolton over his book back in 2020 – alleging that he didn’t follow the correct protocol to have it reviewed for classified information. However, in 2021, the justice department under Joe Biden closed the investigation, and Bolton was ultimately given a federal judge’s go-ahead to publish his book. The FBI raided the home of Donald Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic John Bolton on Friday morning, according to reports. The federal search of Bolton’s house in the Washington DC area was as part of an investigation involving the handling of classified documents, the Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed source. The FBI director, Kash Patel, posted a cryptic message on X on Friday morning, saying: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” The raid began around 7am ET and was first reported by the New York Post. More to follow as we get it. The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down. Cook, who was appointed to the US central bank’s powerful board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused by Donald Trump’s officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are unconfirmed. The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the Fed’s independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the Fed’s board. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.” The Fed declined to comment. The justice department declined to comment. The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has repeatedly endorsed the Reformation Red Pill podcast, and has appeared on four episodes. But the former pastor who hosts the show, and who attends Hegseth’s theocratic church, has voiced a range of extreme positions in recent months on issues including Ice raids, capital punishment, the racist “great replacement” theory, adultery and neo-Nazism. The revelations come on top of recent media reports focused on Hegseth also boosting a video of Douglas Wilson and other Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) pastors arguing that women should lose the vote in the United States. They also follow previous revelations about Hegseth’s links to or apparent sympathies for Christian nationalist positions. Joshua Haymes is a member of the CREC-aligned Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship (PHRF), and his podcasts advocate for the CREC’s moral and theological positions. As the Guardian previously reported, he once served as a pastoral intern at the church. Online he has claimed that liberalism is a greater threat to the US than neo-Nazism, and that the Bible is “pro-Ice raids”. On X, he has also advocated for capital punishment for adultery and abortion, and appeared to call for the drowning of LGBTQ+ Pride marchers. In an emailed comment, Haymes clarified his current professional role. “I am not a pastoral intern. I have gone full-time into media and content creation. I am not employed by Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship,” he said. President Donald Trump’s administration is faltering in its aggressive pursuit of the death penalty as it revisits cases in which predecessors explicitly decided against seeking capital punishment, AP reports. Since taking office in February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against 19 people, including nine defendants in cases in which president Joe Biden’s administration had sought lesser sentences. But judges have blocked those reversal attempts for all but two defendants, most recently on Monday in a pair of cases in the US Virgin Islands, showing the limits of the Trump administration’s power to undo decisions in cases already well underway. In pursuing capital punishment, the Justice Department is seeking to follow through on a Trump campaign promise to resume federal executions after they were halted by Biden’s Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Republican president’s Justice Department has accused the previous Democratic administration of supplanting “the will of the people with their own personal beliefs” in failing to seek death sentences in many cases involving horrific crimes. Detailed opinions haven’t been issued in the most recent two cases, which involve a man accused of killing a police officer in 2022 and two men accused of armed robbery and murder in 2018. But other judges who have rejected reversal attempts on constitutional and procedural grounds were blunt in their assessment of the Trump administration’s approach. “The government has proceeded hastily in this case, and in doing so has leapfrogged important constitutional and statutory rights,” Trump appointee US judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland wrote in June, striking the notice of intent to seek the death penalty against three alleged MS-13 gang members accused of killing two teenage girls in 2020. “That is unacceptable.” The Trump administration has unilaterally stripped hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their union contracts after a federal appeals court overruled an injunction which halted the plans. It is just getting started, according to the White House. An executive order issued in March sought to cancel all collective bargaining agreements for most federal employees, citing national security concerns – and remove collective bargaining rights from more than a million workers. While unions including the American Federation of Government Employees launched legal action as they challenged the move, obtaining an injunction, this was in effect overruled earlier this month. Union contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture have since been terminated. An estimated 400,000 have been affected, about 2.6% of unionized workers in the US. “I think that what this administration is doing is trying us as a test bed. If they are successful, I do believe that they’ll be coming after every labor organization in the US,” Everett Kelley, president of the AFGE, the largest federal labor union in the US, told the Guardian. “This is a fight for the very democracy of this country. This is a fight for every worker in America. “If Trump is successful in dismantling AFGE, there’s nothing to stop him from coming after every labor organization in the country, and we believe he will.” The US vice-president, JD Vance, previewed in Georgia on Thursday the lines of attack candidates will use to defend the president’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the midterms next year, calling it “the biggest tax cut for families that this country has ever seen”. Vance touted an increase in the child tax credit, the elimination of taxes on overtime and on tips in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act while speaking in a warehouse for ATLA Refrigeration in Peachtree City, Georgia. Vance did not mention that only the first $25,000 of tips will be tax free and will require itemization to claim, something few service workers do because the standard deduction usually provides a larger benefit. Eliminating overtime taxes also applies to the first $12,500 of a filer’s overtime income, phasing out at $150,000 of income. The increase in the child tax credit is $200 a child under 17 to $2,200, which will now be indexed to inflation. The event also served as a preview of the attacks Jon Ossof, the Georgia Democratic senator, will face in the bruising swing state battle to come next year. The White House paired Vance’s appearance with an information blitz on the “working families” tax cut. Ossoff would come to regret voting against the bill, Vance said. “In about a year, you are not going to be able to turn on the television without Senator John Ossoff pretending that he supported the working families tax cut, when in reality he voted against them,” Vance said. California voters will decide in November whether to approve a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more US House seats next year, after Texas Republicans advanced their own redrawn map to pad their House majority by the same number of seats at president Donald Trump’s urging. California lawmakers voted mostly along party lines Thursday to approve legislation calling for the special election. Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, who has led the campaign in favor of the map, then quickly signed it – the latest step in a tit-for-tat gerrymandering battle, AP reported. “This is not something six weeks ago that I ever imagined that I’d be doing,” Newsom said at a press conference, pledging a campaign for the measure that would reach out to Democrats, Republicans and independent voters. “This is a reaction to an assault on our democracy in Texas.” Republicans, who have filed a lawsuit and called for a federal investigation into the plan, promised to fight the measure at the ballot box as well. California Assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, said Trump was “wrong” to push for new Republican seats elsewhere, contending the president was just responding to Democratic gerrymandering in other states. But he warned that Newsom’s approach, which the governor has dubbed “fight fire with fire,” was dangerous. “You move forward fighting fire with fire and what happens?” Gallagher asked. “You burn it all down.” Texas’ redrawn maps still need a final vote in the Republican-controlled state Senate, which advanced the plan out of a committee Thursday but did not bring the measure to the floor. The Senate was scheduled to meet again Friday. Environmental groups have welcomed the ordered closure of the Trump administration’s notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail within 60 days. In her 82-page order, published in the US district court’s southern district of Florida on Friday, judge Kathleen Williams determined the facility was causing severe and irreparable damage to the fragile Florida Everglades. The shock ruling by district court judge Kathleen Williams builds on a temporary restraining order she issued two weeks ago halting further construction work at the remote tented camp, which has attracted waves of criticism for harsh conditions, abuse of detainees and denial of due process as they await deportation. “This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperilled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, which mounted the legal challenge. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government - and there are consequences for ignoring them”. Judge Williams also ruled that no more detainees were to be brought to the facility while it was being wound down. She also noted that a plan to develop the site on which the jail was built into a massive tourist airport was rejected in the 1960s because of the harm it would have caused the the land and delicate ecosystem. “Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.” No further construction at the site can take place, she ruled, and there must be no further increase in the number of detainees currently held there, estimated to be about 700. After the 60-day period, all construction materials, fencing, generators and fixtures that made the site a detention camp must be removed. Read my colleague Richard Luscombe’s latest report here: Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that the Trump administration has been accused of wanting to “proactively conduct reviews of social media posts and revoke visas based not on conduct but speech”. It comes as the state department said it was reviewing the records of more than 55 million US visa holders for potential revocation or deportable violations of immigration rules, in a significant expansion of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. David J Bier, the director of immigration policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in DC, told the Washington Post: I doubt that’s feasible for everyone, but I suspect that these reviews will be done in a discriminatory manner targeting immigrants with certain backgrounds and in certain visa categories or specific people they want an excuse to revoke. In a move first reported by the Associated Press, the state department said that all of the foreigners who currently hold valid US visas are subject to “continuous vetting” for any indication that they could be ineligible for the document, including those already admitted into the country. Should such evidence come to light, the visa would be revoked and, if the visa holder were in the United States, they would be subject to deportation. “We are gathering more information than ever,” a senior state department official told the Washington Post, admitting it was likely that social media vetting would add more time to the review process. It follows an announcement by the Trump administration on Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which handles requests to stay in the US or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants and that “reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that vetting”. Read our latest report here: In other developments: California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a law to hold a special election in November in which voters will be asked to approve a new congressional map, tilted in favor of Democrats, for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, if Texas goes ahead with a plan to do the same for Republicans. Donald Trump ventured from the White House in his motorcade through the not all that mean streets of Washington DC to deliver pizza and hamburgers to law enforcement officers and National Guard troops, and regale them with his plans to upgrade the grass in the district to make it look more like one of his golf courses. “I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world”, the commander-in-chief told the officers. A federal judge ruled that Trump’s former lawyer and campaign surrogate, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. A New York state appeals court tossed out a half-billion-dollar penalty that Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the president fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets to bolster his family business. Despite the president falsely claiming the ruling to be a “total victory”, the five-judge panel let the lower court’s fraud verdict stand, which paves the way for New York attorney general Letitia James to appeal the decision to the state’s highest court. The Trump administration ratcheted up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down.
