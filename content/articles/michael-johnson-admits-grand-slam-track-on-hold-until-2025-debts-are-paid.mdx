  Grand Slam Track will not take place in 2026 unless athletes receive their
  prize money for this year, says founder Michael Johnson. The four-time Olympic
  sprint champion confirmed the upstart track circuit has been unable to pay
  millions in appearance fees and prize money from its inaugural season and will
  not move forward until those debts are cleared. Grand Slam Track launched in
  2025 as a high-paying alternative to the Diamond League, focusing exclusively
  on track events and offering salaries for contracted athletes along with up to
  $100,000 for race winners. The concept lured in top names, including British
  Olympic sprinters Daryll Neita and Matthew Hudson-Smith, and 1500m world
  champion Josh Kerr, with the promise of swift payouts and a bold new stage for
  elite sprinting and middle-distance races. The season began with meets in
  Kingston, Miami and Philadelphia, though the latter was trimmed from three
  days to two as costs mounted. The finale in Los Angeles, scheduled for June,
  was cancelled altogether after organizers failed to secure promised
  investment. Johnson said the move was designed “to avoid further losses” and
  begin the “lengthy process of stabilizing the company to get back on track”.
  “It is incredibly difficult to live with the reality that you’ve built
  something bigger than yourself while simultaneously feeling like you’ve let
  down the very people you set out to help,” Johnson said in a statement on
  Friday. “We promised that athletes would be fairly and quickly compensated.
  Yet, here we are struggling with our ability to compensate them.” Industry
  outlet Front Office Sports reported last month that Grand Slam owes around
  $13m to competitors. Johnson blamed the crisis on “circumstances beyond our
  control” after committed funding failed to materialize, but insisted the
  league had no plans to fold. Instead, he said, Grand Slam is “putting systems
  and partnerships in place” to ensure such a breakdown never happens again.
  “While I am no stranger to setbacks and overcoming obstacles, this current
  situation of not being able to pay our athletes and partners has been one of
  the most difficult challenges I’ve ever experienced. The 2026 season will not
  happen until these obligations are met – and that is my number one priority.”
