  High street banks across the UK have lost the equivalent of £100bn in savings
  as more customers turned from traditional lenders towards online banks and
  building societies, figures show. Experts at KPMG said rival banks – including
  new challenger banks, specialist lenders and building societies – had lured
  customers away from incumbent banking groups with higher savings rates. The
  traditional banks’ market share in deposits dropped from 84% in 2019 to 80% in
  2024, it added. Meanwhile the banking sector collectively suffered a £3.7bn
  combined drop in total pre-tax profits last year, marking the first major
  downturn since the rebound in the wake of the pandemic. The sector’s average
  return on equity, a key performance measure, is expected to fall by more than
  a third, from a peak of 13% in 2023 to 8% by 2027. That is equivalent to an
  £11bn drop in annual profits. KPMG warned that banks were under pressure to
  adapt to major changes in the sector, including increased competition and
  rising costs. The flight of customers from high street lenders follows a
  period in which banks were accused of “profiteering” from rising interest
  rates by offering paltry returns for savers. Executives from big high street
  names such as Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, HSBC and Barclays were hauled
  into meetings with regulators and MPs in 2023, amid concerns that interest
  offered on savings lagged far behind the soaring interest rates for mortgages
  and loans. These concerns sparked debate over whether the government should
  impose a windfall tax on banks, to recoup costs for consumers during the cost
  of living crisis. Similar policies were introduced in the Czech Republic,
  Lithuania and Spain, but UK politicians have so far refused to follow suit.
  Peter Westlake, a partner in KPMG UK’s banking strategy team, said: “Banks are
  facing a lower-growth, higher-cost environment that demands transformation at
  pace. While we can expect profitability to broadly remain sound this year, the
  entire sector needs to show how they are preparing for challenges ahead.” Bank
  costs rose by 6% in 2024, which – together with falling productivity among
  workers – could put bank profits under further pressure, according to KPMG’s
  report. Westlake suggested that banks could turn to less conventional methods
  to boost profits, including by embracing artificial intelligence. “The winners
  will be those that move beyond tactical cost-cutting and proactively address
  oncoming market headwinds through business model transformation,” he said.
