  Newcastle have agreed a £70m deal for Stuttgart’s striker Nick Woltemade, who
  is due to have a medical on Tyneside on Friday morning. The 23-year-old’s
  transfer could open the door for Alexander Isak to secure his long-coveted
  move to Liverpool. Woltemade has two Germany caps and loomed large on Bayern
  Munich’s shopping list this summer after scoring 17 goals in 33 appearances
  for Stuttgart last season. The fee includes £5m of add-ons. His arrival would
  end Eddie Howe’s long search for a striker. After being rejected by, among
  others, Liam Delap, Hugo Ekitiké, João Pedro and Benjamin Sesko during a close
  season blemished by Isak’s decision to go on strike as the forward attempts to
  force a move to Anfield, this breakthrough will come as a huge relief to
  Newcastle’s manager. It should also almost certainly preface a fresh bid from
  Liverpool for Isak. Newcastle have rebuffed one £110m offer from the Premier
  League champions but, given the Swede’s refusal to return to training or
  playing, it is thought a sum nearer £130m may be sufficient. With Callum
  Wilson having joined West Ham and deep uncertainty surrounding Isak, Howe
  remains in the market for two strikers. This week Newcastle had a second, £55m
  bid rejected for Wolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen and it appears unlikely the
  Norway international will be allowed to leave. Negotiations for Brentford’s DR
  Congo striker Yoane Wissa remain ongoing but have proved complicated with
  Newcastle having at least two bids turned down for a player who appears to be
  intent on a transfer to St James’ Park. Although an element of doubt surrounds
  the precise figure Newcastle are paying for Woltemade, it will be a club
  record fee, eclipsing the £63m invested in recruiting Isak from Real Sociedad
  three years ago. Howe will be particularly delighted with another figure.
  Having wanted to add real height to his already physically powerful team, he
  has now acquired a deceptively skilful 6ft 6in centre-forward dubbed a “Two
  metre Messi-Musiala” by Stuttgart fans. One of Woltemade’s jobs at St James’
  Park will be to convert crosses supplied by Anthony Elanga, a £55m arrival
  from Nottingham Forest this summer. With the central defender Malick Thiaw,
  the midfielder Jacob Ramsey and the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale having also
  joined Newcastle from Milan, Aston Villa and Southampton respectively during
  the current window, Howe’s squad has, albeit quietly, acquired the sort of
  much-needed strength in depth that may yet compensate for Isak’s prospective
  exit.
