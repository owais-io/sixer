  Nigel Farage’s plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers,
  including women and children, and withdraw the UK from vital human rights
  protections have triggered fierce condemnation from campaigners, legal experts
  and political opponents, who said the proposals would dismantle Britain’s
  postwar commitments and shred fundamental rights. Unveiling Reform UK’s
  “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative Oxford press conference, Farage
  claimed his party would detain and deport “absolutely anyone” arriving by
  small boat and ensure they are “never, ever allowed to stay”, insisting this
  would stop crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of
  billions of pounds”. Pressed by reporters, Farage confirmed that women and
  children would also be detained under the plans, conceding that “how we deal
  with children is a more complicated and difficult issue” but insisting all
  arrivals would be subject to removal. But Farage repeatedly dodged questions
  about how the scheme would work in practice. He was unable to name a single
  RAF base to be converted into secure detention facilities, despite insisting
  they would be central to his plans. He offered no detail on how Reform would
  secure deportation agreements with countries such as Iran, Afghanistan,
  Eritrea and Sudan, many of which have no return treaties with the UK and are
  considered unsafe by British courts. Farage could not explain how Reform’s
  scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of
  independent estimates. Reform’s leadership said it would repeal the Human
  Rights Act, leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR), and disapply
  the 1951 refugee convention and UN convention against torture, with senior
  party figure Zia Yusuf declaring that “no lawyer and no judge” would be able
  to prevent deportation flights from leaving. George Peretz KC, the chair of
  the Society of Labour Lawyers, said: “The Reform party’s policy is simply not
  rooted in reality. They want to institute a mass deportation programme with no
  real, or workable, idea of where people would be deported to. “Reform’s policy
  would require a returns policy to be negotiated with regimes such as the
  Taliban and Iran, and may, by their own admission, involve paying those
  regimes to do so. Which is impractical and extremely concerning, as well as
  unlawful (as our own courts ruled in the Rwanda case).” Kolbassia Haoussou,
  the director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, called the plans
  “a gift to repressive regimes” and said Britain would be abandoning one of
  humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. He said: “This is not who we are as a
  country. “Men, women and children are coming to the UK looking for safety.
  They are fleeing the unimaginable horrors of torture in places like
  Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. These laws were created in the aftermath of the
  second world war to protect us all. If Britain were to abandon this legacy it
  would hand repressive regimes around the world a gift and undermine the
  promise to defend our shared right to live a life free from torture.” The
  human rights lawyer Adam Wagner KC said Reform’s promises were not only
  “legally extreme” but fundamentally misleading. “A lot of the rights contained
  in the European Convention come from British common law: the right to a fair
  trial, freedom of religion, and the right not to be tortured,” he said.
  “Farage may believe repealing treaties clears the path for mass deportations,
  but UK courts are not bound to ignore centuries of legal tradition.”
  Politicians swiftly challenged the scale and practicality of the plans.
  Downing Street accused Nigel Farage of not being “serious” about his plans to
  deport asylum seekers, saying that leaving thefECHR would undermine peace in
  Northern Ireland. The prime minister’s spokesperson criticised the Reform
  leader on Tuesday, saying that any plan that required leaving the ECHR was
  bound to fail. “The ECHR underpins key international agreements on trade,
  security and migration – and the Good Friday agreement,” Downing Street said.
  “Anyone who is proposing to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement is not
  serious.” No 10 refused, however, to criticise other elements of Farage’s
  speech, including his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a
  “scourge”, as well as his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major
  civil disorder”. Asked about those comments, the spokesperson said: “We have
  to recognise the strength of feeling about this and the pressure that it puts
  on public services. That’s why we are taking the serious, practical action to
  address this issue, and not just returning back to the old gimmicks, the old
  slogans that failed to deal with this and left us with the crisis that we
  currently face.” Pushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns
  deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, as Farage has suggested, Downing
  Street said: “We’re not going to take anything off the table in terms of
  striking returns agreements with countries around the world.” Daisy Cooper,
  the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Farage’s plan crumbles
  under the most basic scrutiny. “The idea that Reform is going to magic up
  places to detain hundreds of thousands of people and deport them to countries
  who haven’t agreed to take them is taking the public for fools. Of course
  Nigel Farage wants to follow his idol Vladimir Putin in ripping up the human
  rights convention. Winston Churchill would be turning in his grave.” Farage
  claims the programme would deport up to 600,000 asylum seekers in a single
  parliament, yet the costings remain opaque. A report by the Centre for
  Migration Control, which produced costings alongside the MP Rupert Lowe but is
  not led by him, estimated a near-identical mass deportation scheme would cost
  £47.5bn over five years. Farage insists his plan would provide the same scale
  of removals for £10bn, but offered no operational blueprint or independent
  evidence to support the claim. Farage argued that “over three-quarters” of
  small-boat arrivals were “young undocumented males” from “cultures entirely
  different from ours” who were “unlikely to assimilate” and “pose a risk to
  women and girls”, language likely to draw criticism from equality groups and
  anti-racism campaigners. He also spoke of a “genuine threat to public order”
  if his proposals were not adopted, framing his plan as the only bulwark
  against rising anger and “civil disorder”.
