  UK bank shares tumbled on Friday, cutting the stock market value of the sector
  by almost £8bn in morning trading, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large
  lenders in the autumn budget spooked investors. Calls for a tax grab, in a
  paper written by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank,
  took a toll on some of the UK’s biggest high street banks. NatWest Group
  suffered the biggest drop on Friday morning, registering a decline of as much
  as 5% in its share price, while Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays followed
  close behind, falling 4.5% and 3.6% respectively. HSBC dropped more than 1%.
  The falls cut the notional value of the UK’s biggest banks by £7.9bn within
  hours of the market opening. Rumours are swirling over a number of potential
  tax increases – including on banks, property and landlords’ rental income –
  which could help the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, plug a shortfall of up to
  £40bn in the public finances. The IPPR’s report calls for a new tax on the big
  banks that would help to recover “windfalls” enjoyed by lenders as a result of
  an emergency economic policy known as quantitative easing, which was put in
  place after the 2008 financial crisis. The policy involved the Bank of England
  buying up £895bn of bonds from the UK’s banks and crediting them with reserves
  at the Bank. Those reserves subsequently accrued interest at the central
  bank’s base interest rate: currently at 4%. While the Bank of England is
  winding down QE – a process known as quantitative tightening – the central
  bank is now paying out higher interest rates on banks’ reserves than it is
  receiving on the bonds it holds. That has resulted in a £22bn-a-year loss to
  the public finances, according to the IPPR. The IPPR is now recommending a new
  bank levy, akin to a tax on deposits introduced by the Conservative prime
  minister Margaret Thatcher in 1981. The thinktank said it would help “recoup
  some of these windfalls and put the money to far better use, helping people
  and the economy, not just bank balance sheets”. However, Neil Wilson, the UK
  investor strategist at Saxo Markets, said that while banks were “easy pickings
  politically”, a fresh tax would not align with Labour’s message about the
  City’s role in spurring growth. “Does it chime with a pro-growth agenda if you
  constrain their ability to create new [money] by lending?” Richard Hunter, the
  head of markets at Interactive Investor, also cautioned that any suggestion of
  a windfall tax was “likely to have an exaggerated impact given the
  government’s obvious need to raise more income in an attempt to mitigate its
  financial difficulties”.
