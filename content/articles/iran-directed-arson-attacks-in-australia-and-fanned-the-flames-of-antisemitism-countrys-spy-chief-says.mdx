  The Iranian government “lit the matches and fanned the flames” of antisemitism
  in Australia, directing at least two arson attacks in the last year – on a
  Melbourne synagogue and a Sydney Jewish restaurant – Australia’s spy chief has
  said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Tehran’s paramilitary
  defenders of the 1979 revolution, will be proscribed by Australia as a
  terrorist organisation. As Australia’s prime minister announced his government
  had expelled the Iranian ambassador, on Tuesday local time, the head of the
  Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Mike Burgess, said
  Tehran was “likely” behind even more antisemitic attacks across the country.
  Iranian diplomats posted to Australia were not involved, Burgess said.
  Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi and three other officials have been given seven days
  to leave the country – the first expulsion of an ambassador from Australia
  since the second world war – and the Iranian embassy in Canberra has been shut
  down. Since the 1979 revolution, Australia had consistently maintained
  diplomatic relations with Iran as well as an embassy in the capital until it
  was shuttered in June in the wake of US bombing raids on Iran. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email All Australia’s diplomatic staff are already out of the
  country. Australians have long been urged not to travel to Iran, and the
  government has repeated those warnings, recommending Australians leave now if
  it is safe to do so. Lewis’s Continental Kitchen, a kosher cafe in the Sydney
  beachside suburb of Bondi, was targeted in an arson attack in October last
  year. There was an arson attack on Adass Israel synagogue in Ripponlea, in
  south-east Melbourne, in December. Both suburbs are home to significant Jewish
  populations. There were no injuries in the attacks. Anthony Albanese said it
  was likely the Iranian government had directed further attacks on Jewish
  targets. “These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression
  orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,” he said. “They were
  attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community. It is
  totally unacceptable. The Australian government is taking strong and decisive
  action in response.” Burgess said the IRGC had used “a complex web of proxies”
  to mask its involvement in the attacks, and that investigators had uncovered a
  “layer cake of cut-outs” between the IRGC, “organised crime elements offshore”
  and alleged perpetrators in Australia. Some of the alleged perpetrators were
  paid for their role in arson attacks on Jewish premises, Burgess said. “We
  have investigated dozens of incidents,” he said. “Iran and its proxies
  literally and figuratively lit the matches and fanned the flames … there’s a
  direct connection that the IRGC are directing, through a series of cut-outs,
  people in Australia to undertake these crimes.” British Australian academic Dr
  Kylie Moore-Gilbert – who was held for 804 days by the IRGC, most of it in
  Tehran’s notorious Evin prison – accused the Iranian embassy in Canberra of
  long playing a “sinister role in sponsoring the surveillance of dissidents
  here in Australia”. “For years now the Iranian-Australian community and other
  victims of the IRGC, including myself, have been literally screaming … that
  Iranian agents are operating brazenly and with few consequences here on
  Australian soil.” Moore-Gilbert welcomed Australia’s “decisive action against
  a brutal regime”, but lamented that it had taken so long to act. Iran’s
  government has long been accused of a malevolent presence in Australia, with
  Iranian-Australians reporting they have been surveilled and intimidated for
  attending protests against the Iranian regime. Two years ago, the then home
  affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, confirmed the threats, saying, “We’re not
  going to stand back and have Australians, or indeed visitors to our country,
  watched and tracked by foreign governments on our soil.” The IRGC was
  established as defenders of the country’s Islamic regime, but has since become
  a feared and repressive paramilitary and political force inside Iran. It also
  has a clandestine foreign intelligence and paramilitary wing, the Quds Force,
  and IRGC personnel – estimated at 190,000 – also operate outside the country.
  The IRGC has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, Canada,
  Sweden, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia, among others.
