  Andrew Miller is only minutes into a crash course on how to use a V8 ocean ski
  when he first drops the C-bomb. The former red beret paratrooper and current
  president of a Rockhampton canoe club is explaining to a first-time paddler
  why he won’t begin on a K1 – the kind of craft the world’s best canoe
  sprinters will paddle when and if they come here to central Queensland to
  compete at the 2032 Olympic Games. “It’s like sitting on a pencil,” Miller
  says. “If a crocodile so much as tapped your hull, you’d be straight into the
  drink!” The club secretary, John Mackenzie, admonishes him: “You had to use
  the C-word.” To be fair to Miller, the proximity of the world’s largest living
  reptile is not much of a secret. On the wall of the humble green shed
  belonging to the Fitzroy Canoe Club is a mascot of sorts: a toy croc called
  Fitzy. Pinned to the noticeboard are tips on being “Croc Wise”. The club’s
  paddling area is a known crocodile habitat, the note reads. Enter boats
  “briskly”. Don’t drag arms and legs in the water. If you capsize, get out as
  soon as possible. In March, the Queensland government announced that the
  Fitzroy River in Rockhampton, about 500km north of Brisbane, would host rowing
  and canoeing events at the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Scattered along
  the banks of the Fitzroy are signs warning of injury or death from saltwater
  crocodiles. A four-metre croc can be right beside you in the water, invisible,
  one reads. Visitors to the “beef capital of Australia” are extremely unlikely
  to see a live saltie. But they won’t miss representations of the prehistoric
  ambush predator throughout the grand sandstone and wrought iron buildings of
  the river port. In the lane behind the newly refurbished Rockhampton Museum of
  Art is a crocodile mural, 18 metres long and five metres high. But now the
  C-bomb has been dropped, the jokes are carpeted. We hop out to our boats atop
  the backs of crocodiles, Miller reckons. But don’t worry, the crocs aren’t
  hungry – “we feed them all the time”. After the gags, Miller gets serious. You
  won’t encounter a croc, he promises. Just enjoy the river, there isn’t a
  better one between here and the mighty Murray. And with that, as the pinks and
  purples of dawn filter through the leaves of paperbarks that line the
  Fitzroy’s banks, the canoeists paddle off into the mist that rises from the
  chalky brown water. Corellas screech from towering gums. Pelicans break the
  still surface of the river. An osprey peers down from the branches of a dead
  tree. The kayak quivers as its rudder hits a clump of duckweed. The canoeists
  paddle upstream, away from the city and the barrage that divides the Fitzroy
  between its salt and freshwater reaches. This piece of infrastructure is one
  reason Miller contends the river is “pristine”. Unlike those to the south, the
  freshwater Fitzroy is not swept by tides, lined by mud and mangrove or racked
  by wind and wave. That concrete barrier, built as a water storage system to
  help meet the region’s water supply needs, also marks a boundary on the
  government’s Queensland crocodile management plan between targeted management
  and general management zones. Upstream of the barrage for 20km, park rangers
  are tasked with removing “all large crocodiles” and any croc “displaying
  dangerous behaviour” from the water. After a couple of kilometres, a pair of
  canoeists pass through a stretch of river they claim is the territory of a
  croc about the length at which it is officially considered “large” – that is,
  longer than 2 metres. A few kilometres farther upstream is the spot that one
  canoe club member sighted a 4.5 metre saltie two years ago. After several
  weeks, it was captured and removed. This is winter, too – the same time of
  year that sunny Queensland will host the summer Olympics – and the period in
  which crocs are most easy to spot, basking their cold blood on riverbanks.
  Yet, statistically, Miller is almost certain to be right. The Boyne River,
  more than 100km to the south, is officially considered the southern boundary
  of typical crocodile habitat. Here in the lower reaches of croc country, the
  number and density of these apex predators is far lower than in the far away
  tropics to the north. A government monitoring program estimates the number of
  crocodiles in rivers of the Cape York peninsula – more than 1,500km to the
  north – at three crocodiles per kilometre. That ratio declines southward, down
  to 0.2 crocs per km on the Fitzroy. The canoe club has been paddling here
  since the late 1970s without incident. They are on the water almost every day,
  often starting in the dark. So, too, their rowing counterparts, who are also
  looking forward to hosting the Olympics. Mackenzie says he has been paddling
  in the river for the past seven years and has seen a croc upstream of the
  barrage only once. It was during the colder months and the saltie had its
  snout out of the water. During the central Queensland winter, he says,
  crocodiles aren’t breeding, aren’t territorial and aren’t hungry. He wasn’t
  worried at all. “It was doing its thing, and I was doing mine,” Mackenzie
  says. “It was quite a majestic encounter”. Other local water users aren’t so
  enamoured of sharing the water with these toothy reptiles. Steve Diehm grew up
  five minutes from the boat ramp above the barrage on the banks of the Fitzroy
  and has spent his whole life in Rockhampton. An avid waterskier, Diehm had a
  boat before he had a car. The Fifo oil and gas worker met his wife and raised
  his three children waterskiing. But, over recent years, Diehm began being
  gnawed by a sense of unease familiar to many north of the tropic of capricorn.
  Since they were protected in the 1970s after being hunted to near
  annihilation, saltwater crocodiles – which despite their name also inhabit
  freshwater environments – have been steadily returning to their former range,
  reclaiming waterways that people swam for decades. Diehm had always been aware
  he was in croc habitat but began to feel less and less safe. Then, when he saw
  a picture of that 4.5 metre saltie captured in 2023, a “horrible feeling”
  wrenched his stomach. He had skied that “exact bank” for 15 years. Diehm
  thought about his children. The 46-year-old was devastated when he made the
  decision that it was no longer safe for his family to be on the Fitzroy.
  Looking out across the river gives Diehm a pang of remorse. It is perfectly
  smooth, basking in sunshine, a “skier’s dream” – and there is not a soul on
  the water. “This should be like the Murray Darling,” he says. “There should be
  houseboats workin’ on here. There should be, you know, park a houseboat, swim
  off it, ski off it. “All this, all the way up here, there’s this ability for
  tourism, for so much good, old-fashioned, outdoor fun.” Diehm believes the
  Olympics would be great for Rockhampton but, without a change to crocodile
  management, he reckons athletes will be “running the gauntlet”. The University
  of Queensland’s crocodile expert, Prof Craig Franklin, runs the world’s
  largest and longest active crocodile tracking program. The Fitzroy Olympics
  plan “worries” him “on a number of levels”. “No. I don’t believe it’s safe,”
  he says. “I think it’s foolish.” Franklin fears the Olympic event sends the
  message that it is “OK to go swimming” in places like the Fitzroy. But
  crocodiles travel vast distances over short periods, crossing barriers and
  moving overland for several kilometres. “Rowing in a place where it’s the
  natural habitat of the world’s largest species of crocodilian and, arguably,
  the most dangerous?” he says. “Why would you do that?” For Mackenzie, though,
  there is no other river like it. Still flush from his early morning canoe as
  he sips a coffee at his regular cafe near the river, the retired financial
  planner reflects that many people worry about all the wrong things. In the
  year to early August, 178 people have died on Queensland roads. That morning,
  Mackenzie watched the Fitzroy’s surface ripple with the movements of big
  catfish, barramundi and bum-breathing turtles. So, yes, he knows there are
  risks when he gets on to the water, but they are ones Mackenzie gladly
  accepts. One of the beauties of this river, he says, is that it’s alive.
