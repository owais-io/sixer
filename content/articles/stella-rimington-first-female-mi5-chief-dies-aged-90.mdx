  Stella Rimington, the first female director of MI5 and the first head of the
  domestic spy agency to be publicly named, has died aged 90. She died on Sunday
  night “surrounded by her beloved family and dogs and determinedly held on to
  the life she loved until her last breath”, her family said in a statement. MI5
  paid tribute to Rimington. Ken McCallum, its current chief, said she was “the
  first avowed female head of any intelligence agency in the world” and praised
  her for breaking “through longstanding barriers”. She was, he added: “A
  visible example of the importance of diversity in leadership.” An accidental
  spy, recruited in the mid-1960s as a typist when her husband, John, was posted
  to India on diplomatic service, Rimington rose through the ranks to end up as
  chief of the Security Service between 1992 and 1996. After her appointment as
  director general, she was the first chief of the agency to be named, although
  no photograph was supplied at first and the only image available was a blurry
  picture of her in the street wearing a distinctive raincoat. “I’m proud that I
  was the first woman DG and that, during the time I was there, MI5 changed from
  being an old-fashioned closet organisation,” she said in an interview in 2011
  as she reflected on her secret career. In her first interview after leaving
  the agency in 2001, with the Guardian, Rimington said she was drawn to the
  world of espionage despite the fact that when she started at the agency “there
  were all of these tweedy guys with pipes”. “I still thought the essence of the
  cold war and spies and stuff was fun. You know, going around listening to
  people’s telephones and opening their mail and stuff,” she added, though she
  also conceded MI5 was “overenthusiastic” during the cold war. Rimington held
  roles in MI5 units tackling counter-subversion, counter-espionage and
  counter-terrorism, and she acknowledged that MI5 was involved in assessing
  threats to national security posed by leaders of the miners’ strike in
  1984-85. She was also involved in debriefing the star British agent Oleg
  Gordievsky after he was extracted from the Soviet Union by MI6 in the
  mid-1980s. Gordievsky said later he “liked her as a woman immensely”, though
  Rimington said in a documentary she was unaware of the romantic impression she
  had made on the defector. During her time as MI5’s director general she
  oversaw an agency making a wider transition from tackling the cold war threat
  to terrorism, and was the first agency chief to give a public lecture to the
  BBC. “I have set out in this lecture to show that a security service such as
  MI5 is compatible with personal liberty within our democracy,” she said. Such
  was her profile, she was considered a model for Judi Dench’s portrayal of M,
  the fictional chief of sister agency MI6, in a series of James Bond movies.
  After leaving MI5, Rimington principally became a writer. Her first book was a
  memoir, Open Secret, published in 2001, though there was a furious row about
  her decision to write an autobiography at the time. Particular objections came
  from the SAS, and she was ordered to remove all references to the elite
  special forces. A series of novels followed, eight with Liz Carlyle, an MI5
  officer as the lead character, and two more with Manon Tyler, a CIA agent. In
  one of her books, Rip Tide, published in 2011, she sent up American officials
  who imagined that al-Qaida could be bombed into submission. “I’m tweaking the
  Americans’ tails,” she said, having previously argued in 2009 the US had “gone
  too far with Guantánamo and the tortures” in an interview with a Spanish
  newspaper. Born as Stella Whitehouse in 1935, she moved from London to
  Barrow-in-Furness aged four, and remembered the port town being repeatedly
  bombed during the war. She married John Rimington in 1963 and they had two
  daughters, but the couple separated in 1984. Rimington and her husband never
  divorced, however, and she and John became friends again later in life, living
  together during the Covid lockdown. “Yes, we argued, but we’ve mellowed. It’s
  a good recipe for marriage, I’d say: split up, live separately, and return to
  it later,” she said.
