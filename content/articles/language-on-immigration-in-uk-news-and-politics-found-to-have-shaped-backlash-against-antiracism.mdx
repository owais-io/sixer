  Language on immigration in UK news and politics found to have ‘shaped backlash
  against antiracism’

  A pattern of “hostile language” in news reports and UK parliamentary debates
  is more likely to describe people of colour as immigrants, or with less
  sympathy, researchers have found. The race equality thinktank the Runnymede
  Trust analysed more than 63m words from 52,990 news articles and 317 House of
  Commons debates on immigration between 2019 and the general election in July
  2024. Researchers concluded that the use of language about race and
  immigration by media and politicians has helped shape “the increase in
  reactionary politics and backlash against antiracism which has emboldened the
  far right in this country”. The report, A Hostile Environment: Language, Race,
  Surveillance and the Media is the second in a series. The first phase of the
  research analysed parliamentary and media reports from 2010 to 2014. It found
  that “illegal” was the most commonly linked word to migrants in parliamentary
  debates, which the researchers said reinforced the perception of migration as
  inherently unlawful. The latest report found that between 2019 and 2024 “the
  word ‘illegal’ has became an even stronger word association with the terms
  ‘migrant’ and ‘immigrant’ in both news and parliamentary debates than it was
  in the 2010–14 period”, which, the authors claim, “shows that the defining
  characteristic of migrants has been cemented as illegality over the past
  decade”. The study claims that since 2014, “hostile environment” immigration
  policies have worked to “expand and normalise the surveillance state” through
  legislation, reporting measures and data sharing. When the researchers
  filtered “words associated with immigrants” in news data by nationality,
  religion, ethnicity and geographical location, they found the word “Mexican”
  was most strongly associated, “typically in the context of news reports about
  the USA”. Referring to the second- and third-placed terms in that category,
  the report added that “Chinese” and “Indian” were also very strongly
  associated with “immigrant(s)”, usually when reporting about immigration “in
  the UK context”. The other most commonly used signifiers of identity
  associated with the word “immigrants” in news were “Asian”, “Irish”,
  “Haitian”, “Muslim”, “Jewish”, “non-white”, “Venezuelan”, “Cuban” and
  “African”. “Overwhelmingly, when the UK news media represents immigrants, the
  image that is invoked … is of an ethnically minoritised person,” the report
  added. Meanwhile, in Hansard data of parliamentary debates, the top 10 words
  most strongly associated with migration were “illegal”, “net”, “committee”,
  “act”, “bill”, “tackle”, “level”, “reduce”, “system,” and “mass”. The report
  said parliamentarians “are more likely to use humanising terms when talking
  about Ukrainians” – such as “guest”, “brave”, “community” or “diaspora”. The
  report claims: “Racist discourse from the highest levels of UK society,
  including politicians and the media, is used to frame immigration as an
  existential threat to the British way of life … this works to justify ever
  more hostile immigration policies.” The report added: “One stark example of
  the partnership between parliament and the news media in framing public
  perceptions of immigration in the UK can be found in connection with the ‘stop
  the boats’ political slogan. “The explicit use of this slogan by rioters in
  the summer of 2024 on banners and in chants demonstrates that the hostile
  language we have identified in our analysis has emboldened sectors of the UK
  public to engage in racist violence. “Throughout the 2019-24 period, news
  articles and political debates disseminating this kind of narrative come out
  in fairly close alignment with each other, both reaching their peak in 2023
  and declining slightly into 2024, but with still very high levels of usage.”
  The Home Office has been approached for comment. The Ministry of Housing,
  Communities and Local Government said the disorder of August 2024 – which
  followed the Southport attack – ‘“highlighted the need for a new approach to
  community cohesion” and that a task force was developing a strategic national
  approach, while £1.5bn was being invested in community services in 75 areas
  nationwide.
