  Liverpool (4-2-3-1) Alisson Rarely tested even when Arsenal were in control.
  His shift comprised a save in each half from Madueke and some risky passes.
  7/10 Dominik Szoboszlai Retained as a makeshift right-back and answered the
  call in match-winning style. Liverpool’s best performer even without his
  stunning free-kick. 9 Ibrahima Konaté More like the powerhouse of last season
  as he dominated Gyökeres and at set pieces, only to hobble off with cramp late
  on. 8 Virgil van Dijk Made an unusually uncertain start but, as Liverpool
  pushed up and improved in the second half, so did their captain. 8 Milos
  Kerkez Struggled for pace against Madueke but always able to recover and
  stifle the threat. Enjoyed the physical battle and more solid. 8 Ryan
  Gravenberch Worked tirelessly to protect his defence and prevent Arsenal from
  capitalising on their superior first half display. An energetic, intelligent
  presence. 7 Alexis Mac Allister Not yet up to speed after an injury-hit
  pre-season. Distribution was ropey and unable to exert his usual influence on
  midfield. 6 Mohamed Salah Quiet by his elevated standards, particularly first
  half, but gave Calafiori a few scares when the champions stepped up after the
  break. 6 Florian Wirtz The game largely passed by the £100m signing. Improved
  in the second half but that was compared to an anonymous opening. Went off
  with cramp. 5 Cody Gakpo This wasn’t a match for forwards to showcase their
  talents and, apart from one shot straight at Raya, he was on the margins. 6
  Hugo Ekitiké Did well with the few scraps he had to feed off. Denied his
  fourth goal in four games by an offside flag against Gakpo. 7 Substitutions:
  Curtis Jones (for Mac Allister 62) 8; Federico Chiesa (for Ekitike 79) 6; Joe
  Gomez (for Konate 79) 8; Wataru Endo (for Wirtz 89) 6. Arsenal (4-2-3-1) David
  Raya Nowhere near Szoboszlai’s free-kick from 30 yards out. Lucky not to be
  punished earlier with a terrible pass to Van Dijk. 6 Jurriën Timber Solid in
  his defensive duties and contained Gakpo throughout, but offered little in the
  final third and wasted several deliveries. 7 William Saliba Another injury
  headache for Arteta. Injured his ankle in the warm-up and, despite insisting
  he was fit to play, lasted four minutes. N/A Gabriel His organisational and
  leadership skills were required when Saliba exited early. Helped Mosquera
  settle well and exuded authority at the back. 8 Riccardo Calafiori Had the
  better of his confrontation with Salah overall. Closest to opening the scoring
  in the first half but pushed back in the second. 8 Mikel Merino A surprise
  inclusion in place of Ødegaard, who was struggling with a shoulder injury.
  Pressed to good effect but faded. 7 Martín Zubimendi The former Liverpool
  transfer target encapsulated the game. A dominant, composed figure in the
  first half but swamped thereafter and conceded the decisive free-kick. 7
  Declan Rice His set-piece delivery was not up to its usual standard but was
  always alert and broke up numerous Liverpool attacks. 8 Noni Madueke Had the
  beating of Kerkez at left-back but took the safe option far too often. No end
  product. 6 Viktor Gyökeres Should Arsenal be worried by their new £64m
  signing? A lumbering, anonymous display and comprehensively controlled by
  Konaté. Booked for a foul on Van Dijk. 5 Gabriel Martinelli The winger’s
  industry could not be faulted but up against a makeshift full-back in
  Szoboszlai Arsenal would have expected, and needed, more. 6 Substitutions:
  Cristhian Mosquera (for Saliba 5) 8; Eberechi Eze (for Martinelli 70) 6;
  Ødegaard (for Merino 70) 7; Dowman (for Madueke 89) 6.
