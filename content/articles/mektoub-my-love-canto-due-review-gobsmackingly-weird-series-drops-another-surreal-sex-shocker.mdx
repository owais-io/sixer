  Mektoub My Love: Canto Due review – gobsmackingly weird series drops another
  surreal sex shocker

  So here it is – the third but, incredibly, perhaps not the final episode in
  the most bizarre arthouse franchise in film history, and which, for its sheer
  melodramatic ker-aziness it commands attention. So, as it were, previously on
  Mektoub My Love … The first film in the series from Tunisian-French director
  Abdellatif Kechiche, who had won the Cannes Palme d’Or for Blue Is the Warmest
  Colour (for which he was famously required to share the award with his two
  acting leads Adèle Exarchopoulos and Léa Seydoux), arrived in 2017. This first
  MML (called Mektoub My Love: Canto Uno) turned out to be an epic erotic summer
  romance set in the early 90s about a guy called Amin (Shaïn Boumedine) who
  comes back from Paris to his hometown of Sète, having abandoned his medical
  studies to follow his dream of being a screenwriter, and finds himself
  immersed in his friends’ intrigues; Ophélie (Ophélie Bau) is engaged to a guy
  away doing military service, but having an affair with Amin’s cousin Tony
  (Salim Kechiouche). But the follow-up, Mektoub My Love: Intermezzo from 2019
  was one of the most gobsmackingly weird films ever shown at Cannes: a
  212-minute drama featuring a mind-bending continuous three-hour sequence set
  over one evening in a nightclub. It also showed more of Kechiche’s new
  softcore sex enthusiasm and obsession with female buttocks. Was this
  experimentalism deliberate? Was Kechiche, like Walerian Borowczyk before him,
  a serious director pivoting to arthouse-erotica for good? Aghast audiences
  wondered if they were witnessing a midlife male breakdown in real time. Now
  the third film is here and … well, it’s shorter at least – just two and a
  quarter hours, and the only explicit sex is at the end. As with the previous
  films, the characters’ most serious personal problems seem to co-exist with a
  dreamily laidback attitude from one and all. But then there is a staggering
  finale, which had the Locarno audience gasp and splutter with incredulous
  shock. The situation now is that big-shot Hollywood producer Jack (Andre
  Jacobs) has improbably come to town with his poutingly discontented young TV
  star wife Jessica (newcomer Jessica Pennington). He claims that Jessica tried
  out for the Taxi Driver role that went to Jodie Foster and it’s not clear if
  this transparent untruth – Pennington and Foster are patently not the same
  generation – is deliberate. The couple show up at Tony’s family restaurant
  demanding service, and Amin and Tony wind up delivering couscous to their
  luxury villa. Amin shows Jack his screenplay – which Jack apparently loves –
  and Tony does a lot of very dangerous flirting with Jessica. The scene is set
  for a monumental farcical meltdown. And where on earth are we going with this,
  given that the last shot of Amin running appears to leave the way open for yet
  another baffling episode of Mektoub My Love? Could it be a surreal film
  project that will continue to evolve on an almost improvisational basis? Maybe
  so. • Mektoub My Love: Canto Due screened at the Locarno film festival.
