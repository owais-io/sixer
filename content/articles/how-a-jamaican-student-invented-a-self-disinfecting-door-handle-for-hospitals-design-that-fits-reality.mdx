  When the Jamaican university student Rayvon Stewart invented a workable model
  for a door handle that could disinfect itself after every touch, it was hailed
  as a potential gamechanger for hospitals, hotels and other businesses, with
  promising implications for controlling the spread of disease, particularly
  during pandemics like Covid-19. Speaking at a recent product launch, Alison
  Drayton, assistant secretary-general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a
  15-member bloc of Caribbean countries, described the invention as a
  “meaningful solution” for the region and a “life-saving design that fits our
  reality”. Stewart, now 30, was just 23 and a student at Jamaica’s University
  of Technology when he conceptualised the pioneering ultra-violet
  self-sanitising door handle model, he calls Xermosol, which he says can kill
  99.9% of pathogens but is safe for people and animals. Since then he has been
  working to bring the product, which benefits from a provisional patent
  protection under the patent cooperation treaty, to market, winning Jamaica’s
  Prime Minister’s National Youth Award and the Commonwealth Health Innovations
  Awards in the process. Today, his invention is celebrated as a symbol of the
  Caribbean’s growing science and technology talent pool, with Drayton
  describing it as a “powerful expression of what happens when innovation is
  rooted in purpose and fuelled by resilience”. Stewart grew up in a poor
  household with his grandmother, in the rural farming community of Mount
  Prospect. “Even though times were tough, we never really thought about that.
  We knew that we had something to do as a family,” he said. The software
  engineer and his cousin were the first in their family to go to university.
  There, he discovered his love of inventing and entered a competition with his
  first idea: 3D modeling software that would allow people to virtually fit
  clothes before purchasing online. When he started volunteering in a hospital,
  his passion for innovation became about solving a problem. “I saw how patients
  were suffering, the assistance that they needed, and how difficult it was for
  the nurses,” he said. This, he added was the inspiration for Xermosol. Dr
  Camille-Ann Thoms-Rodriguez, a University of the West Indies consultant
  microbiologist, said that, while the invention did not replace the need for
  World Health Organisation cleaning guidelines in hospitals, Stewart’s smart
  self-sanitising door handle was an innovative tool that can be used alongside
  others, for infection control. “We’re very proud of him,” she said. “A lot of
  the innovation that we see in healthcare is often from a first-world country
  where there are more resources … but it doesn’t mean that we don’t have good
  ideas here,” she added. Kirk-Anthony Hamilton, co-founder of Tech-Beach
  Retreat, a Caribbean-based tech platform that connects innovators,
  entrepreneurs and investors through summits, programmes and investment, said
  there was a growing desire in the region to tackle ambitious tech projects.
  “Young people in the Caribbean are seeing what opportunities they’re missing
  out on, and they want to be a part of it. They’re reading stories about a guy
  in a garage coming up with a concept, and two years in, the company is making
  $50m a year,” he said. This, he added, was challenging the notion of success
  being limited to professions such as medicine and law. “Now we’re
  understanding … that there is this massive space to operate in that affords
  you even greater levels of opportunity and access and that you can be solving
  problems beyond the scope of your geographic boundaries, using technology.” In
  the broader field of digital technology, businesses such as the software
  development company BairesDev, which has a global workforce of more than
  4,000, said it saw a 400% increase in applications from developers in the
  Caribbean between 2020 and 2024. One possible explanation for this, the
  company’s director of talent acquisition, Felipe Turra, said, was the
  increased demand for software engineers during the Covid pandemic as lockdowns
  drove innovation. “Companies started saying, hey … I need to develop new
  applications, because people can’t leave home,” he said, adding that the
  Caribbean being largely aligned to the US, both in terms of language and
  culture, made it a good fit for its US-based clients. For Stewart, the shift
  in innovations and increasing digital talent is “challenging the myth that
  there isn’t awesome, life-changing technology in the Caribbean”. • This
  article was amended on 15 August 2025. An earlier version said that Rayvon
  Stewart’s invention had been patented; in fact, the self-disinfecting door
  handles have a provisional patent.
