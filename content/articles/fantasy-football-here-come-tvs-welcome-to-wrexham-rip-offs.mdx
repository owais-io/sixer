  It was the crossover that no one in the entertainment industry, or the sports
  world, saw coming: the stars of Deadpool and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
  aligning in February 2021 to purchase a beleaguered professional football club
  in the north of Wales. Four years on from that blockbuster deal, which looked
  all but doomed to end in disaster, Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac (legally changed
  from McElhenney, a tongue-twisting trip wire apparently) have not only proven
  to be eminently noble stewards of 160-year-old Wrexham FC; in hindsight, they
  look even cannier for deciding to make a great show of their attempt to
  reverse the club’s fortunes. Welcome to Wrexham – their Ted Lasso-like
  hourlong series documenting the club’s historic ascent from fifth division
  English football to, now, the Premier League doorstep – has been an
  unqualified hit with American audiences and critics, many of whom came into
  this premise as clueless as the new owners themselves. So it figures now that
  Wrexham has nabbed eight primetime Emmy nominations, Hollywood finds itself
  scrabbling to turn Reynolds and Mac’s offsides run into a proper reality TV
  subgenre, with three new Wrexham knockoffs hitting small screens starting from
  last week. Amazon’s Built in Birmingham: Brady and the Blues follows Tom
  Brady’s quest to turn around Birmingham City. From the kickoff, the seven-time
  NFL champion bristles at any attempts to frame his interest in City as a
  vanity project; that’s even as his series serves up another test of the
  Patriot Way, the TB12 method and other winning formulas that fueled his
  gridiron Cinderella story – a favorite chestnut. “What’s the difference
  between football and soccer”?” he asks, rhetorically. “Nothing.” Throughout
  the five-part series, Brady fancies himself a visionary and disrupter only to
  be revealed as a classic American know-it-all. “I’m a little worried about our
  new coach’s work ethic,” he says, hinting at some buyer’s remorse over former
  England captain Wayne Rooney – who turned out to be a complete disaster as
  manager. Brady would have been far better served making a documentary on his
  conflicting interests as an NFL owner (of the Las Vegas Raiders) and the
  league’s highest-paid game analyst. The alternative, his Prime Video series,
  is as satisfying as a solitary morsel of dark chocolate – once a TB12 nightcap
  staple, bitter and unfulfilling. And that’s despite the excess of clips from
  Peaky Blinders. (Show creator Steven Knight is an executive producer on
  Birmingham.) FX’s Necaxa, the official Wrexham spinoff that debuted Thursday,
  offers a deeper dive into Liga MX – Mexican fútbol. Surprisingly, Mac and
  Reynolds also feature prominently as executive producers and talking heads in
  this five-part series. The job of actually reviving the team falls to Eva
  Longoria, who further seizes the opportunity to reconnect with her Mexican
  roots. Apart from Mac and Reynolds’s cameos, the series is told completely in
  Spanish – a language that Longoria, a Texas native who grew up speaking
  English, is openly self-conscious about speaking. The obvious play here is
  cultural representation, and it will surely find an audience in a league that
  was once more watched in the US than the Prem. Only one Wrexham knockoff
  really scores: ESPN+’s Running of the Wolves. At first blush the idea of a
  third-division Italian team owned by Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, daytime
  TV’s impossibly good looking real-life married couple, couldn’t seem more
  far-fetched. But Consuelos isn’t playing a part here. In fact, he spent chunks
  of his formative years on the boot, grew up rooting for Juventus and speaks
  fluent (if heavily American inflected) Italian. It was in 2022 that he and
  Ripa joined the group that owns Campobasso FC, a properly downtrodden outfit.
  But you wouldn’t know it from the way Consuelos cheerleads for them on Live!,
  syndicated TV’s morning colossus. Campobasso is a real-life fantasy team for
  Consuelos. He bolts to Italy at a moment’s notice to participate in personnel
  meetings and stir enthusiasm around town. (“Really good haircuts, great
  tattoos and they smell amazing!” was how he assessed the team after greeting
  them coming off the bus before a friendly.) When co-owner Mark Rizzetta rings
  long distance from Italy to strategize about acquiring a star player who once
  seemed out of reach, Consuelos doesn’t hesitate to interrupt dinner at home
  with the wife to take the video call. Wolves doesn’t just nod at Wrexham and
  open with Ripa and Consuelos interviewing Reynolds on Live! about the club.
  (That’s as trash talk between Brady and Mac spices up a matchup between City
  and Wrexham … ) Wolves tweaks the Wrexham formula to more winsome effect over
  the course of its four hourlong episodes. Reynolds and Mac look like kings of
  comedy until they’re set against two former soap stars closing in on 30 years
  of marriage. “In my next life, I want to be an Italian football problem,” Ripa
  sighs as Consuelos and Rizzetta scramble to put a deal together at the
  transfer deadline. Throughout, Ripa makes clear to her husband that she’d have
  an easier time accepting the inconveniences if he’d just buy them a villa
  already. Where Birmingham City is just another mountain to climb for Brady,
  who never cottoned to the role of stay-at-home dad, Consuelos is at pains to
  make his football dream a family affair. After one Wolves win Consuelos dances
  with his daughter inside the team’s rickety stadium, a far cry from the
  hallowed cathedrals of English football. (Square that with Brady mocking
  Birmingham City’s much nicer but still humble headquarters as he’s pulling up
  …) Consuelos attaches to players – not least Abdallah Soulemana, a lightly
  used Ghanan-American defenseman from the Bronx. In the pilot, Consuelos can’t
  bear the idea of cutting Soulemana and losing out on his potential, so he
  arranges a loan to another team and makes the extra effort to seek him out on
  the field to gently break the news. Still, once you get past the game
  highlights and human interest stories, there will be no missing these Wrexham
  knockoffs for what they truly are – hackneyed exercises in marketing and
  self-promotion, with a bit more spit and polish. And there’s no mystery to why
  American celebrities, masters of this dark art, are making reality TV the
  cornerstone of their global football exploits. Since Reynolds and Mac bought
  Wrexham, they’ve seen their initial $2.5m investment in the team mushroom into
  a roughly $475m asset and the town of Wrexham reborn as a global tourist trap.
  Talk about faking it till you make it. It’s not hard to imagine Michael B
  Jordan (Bournemouth), Snoop Dogg (Swansea City) and more celebrity football
  owners getting into the international TV game. But it is hard to imagine them
  replicating Consuelos’s genuine enthusiasm for the actual sport. You get the
  sense that if the day ever comes when he’s forced to sell the family stake in
  Campobasso, it’ll be to make way for owners with more cash to put them at the
  top of Europe’s football table – or to score Ripa her dream villa. In all
  likelihood, their particular football problems won’t feel quite so first world
  to sports fans who know from struggle.
