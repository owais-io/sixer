  Tina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after
  midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th
  birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit
  to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to
  go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.
  Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as
  her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure
  euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a
  lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a
  bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”. Woods, who lives in London but
  grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling,
  mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends
  or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30 years. “I started to get into the
  softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the
  beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was
  responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me
  feel alive.” Woods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New
  York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical
  writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in
  healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health
  technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live
  longer with AI. In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a
  connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and
  understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music
  to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what
  could delay the ageing process,” she says. Since she was 56, she has tested
  her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at
  35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with
  Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a
  conference. However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached
  unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became
  dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important
  in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery
  would necessitate four to six months of recovery. “How am I going to cope?”
  thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side,
  if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent
  surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons
  gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way. One
  night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to
  a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack.
  “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room
  under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.” Woods had
  found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were
  like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people
  had signed up.” They called their event Longevity Rave. Woods now DJs once a
  month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The
  dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort
  of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a
  woman,” she says. She doesn’t plan to stop her consultancy business: “DJing is
  not a career. It’s more of a calling.” But her world has become “more vivid …
  more electric … There are lots of successful DJs well into their 60s and 70s.
  So who knows? I’m just following a path, seeing where it goes.” • Live Longer
