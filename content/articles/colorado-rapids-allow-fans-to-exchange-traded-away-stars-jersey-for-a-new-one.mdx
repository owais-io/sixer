  The Colorado Rapids are celebrating the arrival of their new star player by
  allowing fans to discard memorabilia of their old one. The MLS team announced
  on Thursday that it has acquired Eintracht Frankfurt attacking midfielder
  Paxten Aaronson in a club-record deal involving a reported $7m transfer fee.
  The purchase fills an obvious need for the Rapids, as the club’s previous
  starting No 10, Djordje Mihailović, was traded to Toronto FC for $8m after
  expressing to the club that he wanted to leave not even two full seasons after
  joining. Mihailović said he requested a transfer for “personal reasons”, a
  surprising turn of events for a player who quickly became a linchpin of the
  team’s attacking unit after joining from AZ Alkmaar, leading Colorado to the
  playoffs for the first time in two seasons last year. This year, the Rapids
  are enjoying their best season since 2021. Toronto FC, meanwhile, are in the
  midst of a full rebuild, having failed to make the MLS playoffs in each of the
  previous four seasons and never finishing higher than 11th in the Eastern
  Conference in that timespan. The club recently jettisoned high-priced stars
  Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi and remain mired near the bottom of
  the East. But in his introductory press conference with Toronto FC, Mihailovic
  indicated that he felt his new club had a greater commitment to success,
  citing “The idea of getting back to winning trophies here” among his reasons
  for the move. “Everybody talks about winning. Everybody talks about making
  playoffs,” he said. “I could truly sense the truth behind them explaining
  their project.” Now, the Rapids are allowing their fans move on without
  Mihailović. In announcing the acquisition of Aaronson, the club said it will
  allow fans who bought jerseys with Mihailović’s name and No 10 on the back for
  new ones, either blank, with Aaronson’s name and number, or that of select
  other players. A Rapids spokesperson told the Guardian US that the club
  decided to enact the program as a way of showing their commitment to their
  community, admitting that Mihailovic’s move “came as a surprise” and that
  Aaronson’s acquisition marks “a turning point and a fresh chapter for the
  club, our fans, and our new rising star”. A program of this type is
  exceedingly rare but not unheard of. In 2018, sports retailer Fanatics said it
  would allow NBA fans to exchange recently purchased jerseys of a player who
  was traded for another. The retailer now runs a similar program across all
  sports for players whose jersey is purchased within 90 days of being traded.
  The NFL put the brakes on a similar program run by a Detroit realtor for
  Matthew Stafford Lions last year. In a much more serious scenario, the New
  England Patriots ran a program to allow fans to trade in their Aaron Hernandez
  jerseys after he was charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd. Paxten Aaronson,
  the brother of Leeds United’s Brenden Aaronson, is leaving behind the chance
  to play in the German Bundesliga but will step into a situation where he’ll be
  relied upon to take a leading role for the Rapids. The younger Aaronson spent
  last season on loan to Utrecht in the Dutch Eredivisie, where he scored a
  team-high eight goals and added four assists while starting consistently as
  Utrecht finished fourth in the league. Aaronson moved to Eintracht Frankfurt
  in 2022 after breaking through with the Philadelphia Union, his home town
  club. He made his debut for the US men’s national team in 2023 and was on the
  roster for the 2025 Gold Cup along with his brother.
