  Bridget Phillipson has defended her cabinet colleague Angela Rayner over
  accusations the deputy prime minister avoided tax when buying a seaside
  property in East Sussex. The education secretary said Rayner had the right to
  buy the £800,000 flat in Hove “so long as she followed all the rules”, after
  reports Rayner had avoided £40,000 in stamp duty by listing it as the only
  property she owns. Conservatives have accused Rayner, who is also the housing
  secretary, of hypocrisy given she has also listed her Greater Manchester home
  as her primary residence, in a move that allowed her to avoid £2,000 in
  council tax on her government-owned flat in central London. Phillipson told
  Times Radio on Sunday: “Angela Rayner has been clear that she followed all the
  rules and requirements of her, that she has followed the rules completely.
  “That is her position, that she has done everything that has been asked of
  her.” Asked whether it was hypocritical for Rayner to buy the flat in Hove,
  Phillipson replied: “If an individual wants to buy a property, whether that
  individual is Angela Rayner or anybody else, they are entirely within their
  rights to spend their money as they choose … Angela Rayner, as an adult with a
  salary, is able to make choices about how she spends her own money.” She
  added: “So long as she’s followed all of the rules and requirements as a part
  of that, then I don’t think there’s anything more.” Rayner has been under
  pressure since it emerged she had bought the flat weeks after removing her
  name from the deed of her constituency home in Ashton-under-Lyne. Because she
  was not listed as one of the owners of the Greater Manchester home, she
  avoided having to pay a higher rate of stamp duty, which is applicable to
  purchases of second homes. She is reported to have sold her stake in the
  Ashton house to pay for the flat in Hove. The deputy prime minister is
  reported to have separately listed the constituency home as her primary
  residence, meaning she did not have to pay council tax on her grace-and-favour
  apartment in Admiralty House on Whitehall, London. The Mail on Sunday reported
  over the weekend that Rayner had in 2023 split the ownership of the Ashton
  house with a trust administered by the law firm Shoosmiths. Rayner’s office
  did not respond to requests for comment. The row has been given extra
  prominence in the run-up to the budget, amid reports that Labour is planning
  to increase property taxes as a way of avoiding a multibillion-pound shortfall
  in public spending. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is said to be considering a
  range of options including an annual property tax to replace stamp duty
  entirely. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, will seek to highlight those
  reports on Monday during a visit to meet homeowners in Reigate in Surrey
  alongside the shadow housing secretary, James Cleverly. Badenoch said on
  Sunday: “Labour look set to wage a new war on family homes with more taxes
  like those that Labour ministers seemingly want to avoid paying themselves.”
