  As the curtain falls on the Venice and Telluride film festivals, and just
  before Toronto begins, the 69th London film festival has announced a programme
  that cherrypicks from all three predecessors. The annual public festival takes
  place in London but offers virtual and brick-and-mortar opportunities for
  people to watch from all over the UK. The third Knives Out film featuring
  Daniel Craig’s eccentric detective, Benoit Blanc, opens the festival,
  following its debut in Toronto later this week. Other key screenings include
  the European premiere of Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, the Maggie O’Farrell adaptation
  which won raves for Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal at its Telluride premiere
  last weekend, and the UK premieres of Hikari’s Rental Family, starring Brendan
  Fraser and Noah Baumbach’s meta comedy Jay Kelly, starring George Clooney.
  Bradley Cooper’s third film as director/star, standup comedy drama Is This
  Thing On? is also on the lineup, as is Bugonia, Yorgos Lanthimos’s
  well-received latest collaboration with Emma Stone. No less than 247 films are
  on the lineup this year from 79 countries, with 103 of them made by female or
  non-binary directors. This proportion – 42% – is marginally down on last year
  (44%), although there is parity in both the official competition selection and
  the debut film-makers sidebar. The latter category includes some high profile
  names, including Kristen Stewart, whose directorial debut The Chronology of
  Water stars Imogen Poots as an abuse survivor, as well as 27-year-old Ronan
  Day-Lewis, whose first feature, Anemone, was co-written by his father, Daniel,
  who also stars. The three time Oscar winner is the highest profile booking in
  the festival’s lineup of screen talks, which also includes Lanthimos, Jafar
  Panahi, Lynne Ramsay and Richard Linklater. The notoriously retiring star, who
  quit acting for the second time in 2017 before returning to make Anemone, is
  likely to be a hot ticket when he takes to the stage at the BFI Southbank to
  discuss his new film and career to date. “We really never thought that would
  happen,” said Kristy Matheson, director of the festival, of the booking.
  Although sworn to secrecy over Anemone, which has its first screening in New
  York in early October, Matheson said she believed audiences would be surprised
  by the film, which is set in the late 1980s and features Day-Lewis and Sean
  Bean as brothers who served as soldiers in Northern Ireland 20 years before,
  alongside co-star Samantha Morton. “It’s a really exciting debut because
  you’ve got these great actors – a really exceptional cast – but it doesn’t get
  them to do all the heavy lifting. It’s bold and it takes some really big
  swings stylistically.” Matheson notes that this year’s crop of movies also
  demonstrate an appetite among film-makers to play with the form. “There are so
  many films that seem to really be kind of stretching the language of cinema.
  It’s a medium that allows us to sort of play with time and space and so many
  directors are doing that.” She points particularly to the roster of urgent
  political films on this year’s slate, including Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or
  winner It Was Just an Accident, about corruption and paranoia in Iran, and
  fellow Cannes winner The Secret Agent by Kleber Mendonça Filho, set during the
  Brazilian military dictatorship – “a classically made film, but with so many
  playful interventions”. Also on the programme are The Voice of Hind Rajab,
  Kaouther Ben Hania’s dramatisation of the 2024 IDF killing of a five-year-old
  Palestinian girl who lived in the Gaza Strip and Sirāt, Óliver Laxe’s Moroccan
  desert thriller. But Matheson remains sceptical that film-makers have pulled
  up their collective socks as an emergency response service amid widespread
  global unrest. “Often films that seem topical have been in the making for many
  years. And sometimes, it’s just that the dial hasn’t really moved.” Matheson
  cites Landmarks, Lucrecia Martel’s documentary about the murder of Indigenous
  leader Javier Chocobar and the legacy of colonialism on Latin America. “That’s
  a very specific case, but she uses it to really look at the effects of
  colonisation on her country, and you can expand out further from that and
  think about the effects of colonisation on many different places. So it feels
  a really timely concept.” The Argentine director has, like Day-Lewis, been out
  of the spotlight for some years: her last feature was 2017’s Zama, which was
  made nine years after 2008’s The Headless Woman, regularly cited as one of the
  best films of the century so far. Her return, alongside that of Zhao, Ramsay
  and Kelly Reichardt (with The Mastermind), gives Matheson cheer, she says, in
  the face of otherwise disappointing statistics. “A 42% proportion [of non-male
  directors on the programme] is certainly not a number about which we would
  say, oh, isn’t this great. But these are major female directors with
  incredibly strong films.” World premieres at the festival include a drama
  about the friendship between Kate Moss and Lucian Freud and boxing drama
  Giant, starring Amir El-Masry and Pierce Brosnan. • The London film festival
  runs between 8-19 October.
