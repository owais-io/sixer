  ‘The musty whiff of a yard sale’: why is Morrissey attempting to sell his
  share of the Smiths’ catalogue?

  There is a well-trodden line about assessing the trustworthiness of online
  bargains: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. It comes to mind
  when looking at the extremely unusual way in which Morrissey is apparently
  seeking to offload his business interests in the Smiths. This is not like the
  forensic and formal processes behind huge catalogue sales in recent years such
  as Sting, Bob Dylan, Queen, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd or Paul
  Simon. A post on Morrissey Solo – the outlet for all official Morrissey
  communiques – says the singer has “no choice but to offer for sale all of his
  business interests in ‘the Smiths’ to any interested party/investor” and that
  he wants out. Maybe psychologically this is the closure he needs – the band
  will never reform, given bassist Andy Rourke’s death in 2023 and Morrissey’s
  clear personal and political differences with guitarist Johnny Marr – but, in
  straight business terms, this is shockingly cavalier. It all has the musty
  whiff of a yard sale. There is a Gmail address listed as the only channel of
  contact for prospective bidders. Except when you email it, you get a bounce
  back saying no such address exists. “Putting a rights sale on a free email
  account feels like the corporate equivalent of scrawling ‘guitar for sale’ on
  a lamp-post,” says Cliff Fluet, a partner at legal firm Lewis Silkin, a highly
  respected veteran of catalogue sales. “Serious investors will expect data
  rooms, warranties and proper disclosure. A Gmail pitch says none of that is
  coming, so heavyweight bidders will either steer clear or mark the price down
  heavily to cover the risk.” Most of Morrissey’s Craigslist-style post is
  vague, talking about “all” Smiths recording and publishing rights, merchandise
  rights, trademarks and so on being bundled up for sale. Yet he does not own
  any of these outright and even turned down an offer from Marr to share control
  of band-related trademarks. Uncertainty reigns. Will he sign a deal with Marr
  ahead of this sale to clear obstacles for potential new owners? That is the
  great unanswerable question. Marr’s management declined to comment when asked
  by the Guardian. There is an argument that bitter in-fighting,
  non-communication and Morrissey’s own controversial political pronouncements
  in recent years have seriously damaged the Smiths brand. Repairing and
  reviving it is perhaps never going to happen under current ownership, so
  something has to change. “On the face of it, Morrissey is simply cashing out
  of a partnership that appears to be long past ‘irretrievably broken down’,”
  suggests Fluet. “It feels less like a strategic play and more like a desire to
  walk away with whatever value he can still extract.” Alan Wallis is CEO of
  Dynamite Songs and previously ran the music transactions practice at Ernst
  &amp; Young in the late 1990s and early 2000s, so has seen the changing
  dynamics of catalogue sales up close for more than a quarter of a century. He
  says selling a major stake in a commercially and culturally significant music
  catalogue in this idiosyncratic manner is utterly without precedent. How such
  sales normally happen, he says, is that “you put together a pack with all the
  information that someone who is buying it would need to make a non-binding
  offer. Then you go into a diligence process with financial information for the
  last three to five years.” After that, the seller needs to put all related
  contracts in place. “This is to show that you’ve got title for whatever these
  assets are and that you own these assets,” he says. From there, the process is
  typically to solicit a small number of serious bidders. “Normally, you
  wouldn’t go out far and wide,” says Wallis. “You’d do it to a limited number
  [of potential bidders]. You pick who the likeliest are. What you want is a
  little bit of tension between the two or three [bidders] to try to maximise
  the price. I don’t think this is going to achieve that.” Wallis’s concern is
  that offering a sale in this way could be read by the market as a sign of
  desperation. Its unconventional nature and structure may scare off serious
  bidders such as record companies or major rights investors. This could mean
  more mercenary players step forward, ones who are equally mercenary in their
  bids. “When you look at it and you read how he just wants to get away from
  [the Smiths], bidders would low ball,” suggests Wallis. Quick sales can
  happen, but invariably they are dramatically below market value. The Smiths
  were originally signed to Rough Trade in 1983 but their catalogue of
  recordings is now owned by Warner Music Group. The collapse of the Rough Trade
  distribution network in 1991 saw the Rough Trade label sell off its entire
  catalogue to help pay off debts on the distribution side. A source with inside
  knowledge told the Guardian that Warner paid £1m for the Smiths’ recordings in
  this fire sale (equivalent to £2.3m today). “In retrospect,” they say, “it was
  far too cheap.” As such, any plans for the band’s recordings would need the
  full involvement of Warner. Buyers will be getting an important share, not
  total autonomy. Then there is Marr himself. As co-writer of all the Smiths’
  songs, he controls 50% of their publishing. He is also currently the sole
  owner of their associated trademarks, which will directly impact anything
  related to merchandise. Anyone scooping up Morrissey’s stake will still have
  to find common ground with Marr and he will have the power to overrule any
  commercial plans if he feels they are inappropriate or potentially detrimental
  to the band’s legacy and earning potential. “You’d be buying into joint
  ownership with a co-writer who holds the trademark – on behalf of them both –
  and who has veto power over most commercial uses,” explains Fluet. “Without
  Marr’s nod, you don’t get control; you get a near-permanent negotiation.”
  Morrissey had full creative control over the record sleeves for all Smiths
  releases on Rough Trade. As their creator or creative director, he technically
  would have owned the IP in them since Rough Trade was not as obsessed as the
  major labels with nailing everything down contractually. The sale of the
  catalogue to Warner, however, is likely to have contained a clause whereby
  ownership of artwork and promo videos would be rolled into the sale of the
  master recordings. One resolution, of course, would be that Marr and his team
  buy out Morrissey’s stake, meaning all the creator rights sit in a single pot
  and there are no complications or fraught negotiations needed to clear uses
  such as synchronisation deals. Yet given Morrissey’s terse statement (“I am
  burnt out by any and all connections to Marr, Rourke, Joyce”), it may be the
  case that he would peevishly refuse to sell to his former creative and
  business partner. There is, argues Fluet, too much financial uncertainty here
  for any potential purchaser. “The only dependable cash for a buyer lies in
  Morrissey’s receipts of publishing and master recording royalties – the
  receivables that come in every quarter,” he says. “But even that income
  depends on the seller standing behind his paperwork and staying willing to
  cooperate on audits and future clearances. Right now, buyers can’t be sure of
  either.” With politics and relationships being as curdled as they are, and the
  impact this has had on the band’s legacy management in both creative and
  commercial terms, the asking price could be significantly lower than one might
  expect for such an important catalogue. “In a perfect world – clean chain of
  title, no arguments, full cooperation – a Smiths catalogue could fetch tens of
  millions,” estimates Fluet. “This is not that world. Overlapping claims, years
  of legal sparring and the hint of fresh litigation mean any bidder will apply
  a chunky discount.” This is, even if everything is as it claims to be,
  undoubtedly the most unusual tactic to sell a significant catalogue and bundle
  of rights. Wallis, wincing at the fact bids have to be submitted via a Gmail
  address (functioning or otherwise), says Morrissey really needs hardened
  professionals around him to strike an equitable sale price. “Someone’s going
  to have to help him do this deal,” he says. “I don’t know who’s going to be
  looking at the offers that come in.” This, frankly, is just not how music
  rights sales are done. “It might be a pathetic attempt at trying to get
  attention,” sniffs one highly knowledgable music industry source. Another
  well-placed industry name is partly sanguine and partly drily cynical: “It
  will be interesting to see if he actually means it.”
