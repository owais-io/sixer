  Sydney Sweeney registered as a Republican voter in Florida a few months before
  Donald Trump won a second US presidency, it has been revealed, as the public
  continues fixating on a new jeans ad campaign featuring the actor and a pun
  about her genes. The Euphoria and White Lotus star registered to vote in
  Florida on 14 June 2024 – shortly after buying a mansion in the Keys – and
  listed her party affiliation as Republican, according to publicly available
  records reviewed by the Guardian on Sunday. That was about two weeks after
  Trump, another registered Republican Florida voter, was convicted in New York
  City of criminal falsification of business records and before he secured a
  return to the White House in November’s presidential election. It was also
  about two years after Sweeney, 27, faced criticism from some US media
  consumers after she was photographed at her mother’s birthday party where
  several of the guests were seen wearing hats that called to mind those which
  bear Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) slogan. The native of Spokane,
  Washington, subsequently issued a statement on social media pleading with the
  public to “stop making assumptions”. “An innocent celebration … has turned
  into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention,” Sweeney’s
  statement added at the time. Sweeney has not addressed her Florida Republican
  voter registration, the existence of which went viral on social media on
  Saturday and was later reported on by traditional news outlets. The actor by
  then had generated considerable media coverage after the outfitter American
  Eagle released several videos showing her modeling the company’s denim jeans
  and jackets. American Eagle’s campaign generally revolves around the punny use
  of the phrase, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes.” In one video, “genes” is
  crossed out and replaced with “jeans”. Another clip showed the blue-eyed blond
  suggestively looking at the camera and discussing how her body’s composition
  “is determined by … genes”. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring,
  often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My
  jeans are blue,” Sweeney continues in the advertisements, which include a joke
  about the cameraperson becoming distracted by her breasts. Some social media
  users dismissed the campaign as graceless, arguing that it echoed rhetoric
  associated with eugenics and white supremacy at a time when the Trump
  administration was seeking to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)
  initiatives as well as aggressively pushing to detain and deport immigrants en
  masse. One TikTok reaction video that received hundreds of thousands of likes
  accused Sweeney of ignoring the political climate of the moment, saying “it’s
  literally giving … Nazi propaganda”. US conservatives have seized on the
  indignation over the campaign on the liberal fringes, rushing to praise
  Sweeney for landing a blow on “woke” advertising, invoking a term some use to
  besmirch DEI measures. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote on social media
  that criticizing Sweeney’s collaboration with American Eagle was “cancel
  culture run amok”. And on Sunday, when informed by a reporter of Sweeney’s
  Republican voter registration as he boarded Air Force One, Trump himself said:
  “Ooh, now I love her ad.” Nonetheless, many have judged backlash to Sweeney
  and American Eagle’s collaboration as exaggerated and overblown. American
  Eagle’s stock has reportedly risen in the wake of its Sweeney-centered
  campaign. A statement from the company on Friday defended the campaign,
  saying: “‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans’ is and always was about the jeans.
  Her jeans. Her story.” That outcome cut a stark contrast with the 2023 Bud
  Light advertisement involving trans activist and influencer Dylan Mulvaney. A
  conservative-organized boycott against Bud Light substantially drove sales
  down. The brand lost its place as the US beer market’s top seller. And Bud
  Light’s owner, Anheuser-Busch, sought to distance itself from Mulvaney in a
  statement that blamed the promotion on an “outside agency without … management
  awareness or approval”. “No one was trying to cancel Sydney Sweeney,” said a
  post on the X account Wu Tang is for the Children, which counts on more than
  270,000 followers. “And no one cares if she’s Republican or not.”
