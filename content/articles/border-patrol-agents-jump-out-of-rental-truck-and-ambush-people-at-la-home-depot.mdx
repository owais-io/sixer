  US border patrol agents carried out a raid outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles
  on Wednesday, with officers jumping out of an unmarked rental truck and
  chasing and arresting more than a dozen people. Videos of the operation, and
  federal officials’ statements boasting about the detentions, have raised
  questions about whether the US government was complying with a federal court
  order halting indiscriminate raids in the region due to evidence of racial
  profiling. That ruling, upheld last week by an appeals court, followed reports
  of Latino US citizens getting swept up in LA raids and accounts of
  undocumented people being targeted based on their appearance and whether they
  spoke Spanish. Clips of the early morning raid outside a Home Depot in the
  Westlake neighborhood, near MacArthur Park, showed masked, heavily armed
  officers jumping out of a yellow truck from Penske, a private rental company,
  and people fleeing. Day laborers often gather outside Home Depot stores
  looking for work and have been subject to aggressive immigration raids in
  southern California. One day laborer present for the Wednesday raid told the
  Los Angeles Times that the Penske truck pulled up to the parking lot around
  6.45am, with the driver telling people gathered in Spanish that he had work to
  offer. Someone then rolled up the back of the truck, and masked agents,
  including one in a cowboy hat, jumped out as people scattered, the witness
  said. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in an email that
  agents arrested 16 undocumented people from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and
  Nicaragua. Border patrol and DHS spokespeople did not respond to inquiries
  about the arrest tactics and whether agents had been targeting specific
  people. A spokesperson for Penske said in an email that it was aware of the
  videos, writing: “Penske strictly prohibits the transportation of people in
  the cargo area of its vehicles under any circumstances. The company was not
  made aware that its trucks would be used in today’s operation and did not
  authorize this.” The company would reach out to DHS to “reinforce its policy
  to avoid improper use of its vehicles in the future”, the statement said. “It
  is deeply disturbing that the federal government will stoop to these levels to
  continue their campaign of terror against working Angelenos,” said Jorge-Mario
  Cabrera, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights
  (Chirla), a California-based group that is part of the lawsuit challenging the
  raids. “These are Angelenos looking for an honest day’s living … What we see
  in the video looks like an assault on people’s liberties, an assault on
  individuals that were standing there looking for a job, and a targeted
  operation that was in fact lawless.” One witness, who is a member of the LA
  Tenants Union, a grassroots advocacy group, said they were setting up a “know
  your rights” community defense table when the raid began. They took video,
  shared with the Guardian, of a group of officers piling back into the Penske
  truck after making arrests. They said they saw the officers detain street
  vendors and day laborers. “These are people who need to make money to pay
  rent, who have no choice. It was really tragic that the officers came out in
  full force just flaunting their power and bringing another level of chaos,”
  said the witness, who asked to remain anonymous, fearing retribution. Fox News
  published footage from inside the Penske truck, which was reposted by Gregory
  Bovino, a border patrol commander in California, who called it “Operation
  Trojan Horse”. Bovino also posted footage of arrests, writing: “Different day,
  different illegal aliens, same objective. We’re on a mission here in Los
  Angeles. And we’re not leaving until we accomplish our goals.” Bovino has
  previously faced scrutiny for misleading the public about an immigration
  sweep, in which he said agents had a “predetermined list of targets”, many
  with criminal records. Records later showed that 77 out of 78 people detained
  had no prior record with the agency, according to a CalMatters investigation.
  He also falsely claimed that a US citizen who was arrested had been charged
  with “assaulting” one of his officers, as the Guardian reported this week.
  Bill Essayli, the Trump-appointed US attorney for the region, also promoted
  the Home Depot raid on social media, writing: “For those who thought
  immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again. The
  enforcement of federal law is not negotiable.” Those statements have raised
  alarm among advocates as the US government is under court order restricting
  raids in the region. Essayli’s spokesperson declined to comment, and a border
  patrol spokesperson declined to answer questions about Bovino’s statements. In
  a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups
  challenging DHS arrests in LA, a federal court ruled last month the plaintiffs
  were likely to succeed in showing there was a pattern of officers targeting
  people based on factors including their race and ethnicity, speaking Spanish
  or English with an accent, being present at specific locations, or doing
  certain jobs. An appeals court affirmed the ruling, arguing that the US
  government had not meaningfully disputed the conclusions that officers were
  relying on those discriminatory factors in an unconstitutional manner.
  Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern
  California, said in a statement on Wednesday that the organization was “deeply
  troubled” by the Home Depot arrests: “While we continue to investigate these
  incidents, the evidence available so far raises serious concerns that the
  federal government may be in violation of the federal judge’s July temporary
  restraining order.” That order, Tajsar noted, prohibited agents from stopping
  and detaining people “based solely on generalizations about how they look, how
  they speak, or where they are, including where they work” throughout seven
  counties in the region. “As shown at every step in the case thus far, the
  government seems unwilling to fulfill the aims of its racist mass deportation
  agenda without breaking the law,” he said. Cabrera, of Chirla, said that in
  recent weeks, immigrant communities have been able to move more freely with
  less fear of indiscriminate raids due to the court order. The Wednesday
  arrests have shattered that, he said: “It seems to indicate the government do
  whatever they can do to cause panic and terror in the community.”
