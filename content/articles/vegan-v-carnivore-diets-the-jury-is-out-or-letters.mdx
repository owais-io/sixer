  A “bowl of cereal with skimmed milk, a Greek yoghurt and a lean chicken
  breast” – doesn’t that epitomise a “fad diet” (The Guardian view on the
  carnivore diet: red meat for influencers, but bad news for health, 25 August)?
  Ultraprocessed, unsustainable and wasteful – what is supposed to happen to
  most of the chicken and the precious dairy fat? I shall be sticking to the
  nose-to-tail red meat, butter and eggs that have restored my health. I suspect
  that this trend is powered by personal experience more than by influencers.
  Anne Tropper Ropley, Hampshire • Adele Parks’ account of converting to
  pescatarianism explains how she demonstrated for “beauty without cruelty” (A
  moment that changed me: I gave up meat at 16 – and learned how to say no, 27
  August). But, as she still eats fish and dairy, she apparently doesn’t believe
  in food without cruelty. If you really want to be kind to other species, go
  vegan. Otherwise you’re simply saying that your form of cruelty is acceptable
  while others aren’t. Rendel Harris London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
  read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
  considered for publication in our letters section.
