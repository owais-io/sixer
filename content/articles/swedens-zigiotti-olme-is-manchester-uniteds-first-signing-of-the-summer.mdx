  Manchester United have completed their first signing of this summer’s Women’s
  Super League transfer window, bolstering their midfield with the addition of
  the Sweden international Julia Zigiotti Olme from the German champions Bayern
  Munich. The defensive midfielder was one of Sweden’s top performers at Euro
  2025, starting three of four matches, including their quarter-final against
  England, where she was one of only two of Sweden’s seven takers to
  successfully convert her penalty in the dramatic shootout. She was targeted by
  United because of her work rate in midfield, her positioning and experience of
  winning trophies, including helping Bayern to a league and cup double last
  season. The 27-year-old spent one season with the Frauen Bundesliga side after
  playing for Brighton for two campaigns in England. She is also a former
  title-winner in Sweden with Häcken. Her arrival will give Marc Skinner’s team
  additional options in central midfield and, with Zigiotti Olme predominantly
  playing as a deeper lying, defensive midfielder, could allow Dominique Janssen
  to be deployed as a central defender instead. Janssen demonstrated the
  versatility to play in either defence or midfield last season. It could also
  give the side more tactical options for different formations and will
  undoubtedly boost their strength in depth to compete in the Women’s Champions
  League as well as domestically. Discussing the arrival of Zigiotti Olme, who
  has signed a two-year contract, with the option of a further year, Matt
  Johnson, Manchester United’s director of women’s football, told the club’s
  media channels: “Julia is one of Europe’s best defensive midfielders who
  brings a winning mentality and experience of competing in the top
  competitions. “On the pitch she has an insatiable work rate, ability to win
  possession back for her team and creative passing range. This is a player the
  fans will enjoy watching this season.” While she is the club’s first summer
  acquisition, she is unlikely to be the last. It is understood the club could
  also be seeking to sign a forward, following Geyse’s loan move to Gotham FC in
  March for the remainder of the NWSL season, as well as being expected to be in
  the market for a right-sided defender, following Aoife Mannion’s summer move
  to Newcastle United. New contracts have already been agreed with the
  goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, the central defender Millie Turner and
  veteran striker Rachel Williams, but it would not be a surprise to see the
  club sign another goalscorer before their Champions League qualifying campaign
  gets under way against PSV Eindhoven on 27 August. Meanwhile, United’s Ella
  Toone has revealed her grandmother died on the morning of England’s Euro 2025
  final victory over Spain. The 25-year-old played the opening 87 minutes of
  Sunday’s match as the Lionesses retained their title thanks to a penalty
  shootout win. The midfielder lost her father Nick to prostate cancer last
  September. “Even in the highest of highs life can hit you with the lowest of
  lows,” she posted on Instagram. “My Nana Maz took her last breath on the
  morning of our Euro final. I have comfort in knowing she got to watch from the
  best seat in the house with Dad, her favourite person.” She added: “I’ll miss
  you forever nan but I’ll cherish the special memories we made, there isn’t
  enough words I can possibly say to sum up the person you were, but I’m
  grateful you were my nanna. My football-loving, crazy, funny Nan. “All those
  years ago when you put a bet on at the bookies that I would play for England
  one day &amp; on the day you leave us we bring it home again. You always knew
  it.”
