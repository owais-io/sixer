  No Dancing in the Lift by Mandy Sayer Nonfiction, Transit Lounge, $32.99 Mandy
  Sayer is already an award-winning memoirist, but her latest is clearly one
  from the heart: a love letter to her father. Gerry Sayer, a jazz musician, was
  singular in pursuit of his art. In the 1980s, father and daughter moved from
  Australia to the US where they busked without permits, he on drums and her
  tap-dancing along, and dodged debt collectors by moving between grotty hotels.
  Decades later, Gerry was diagnosed with terminal cancer and Mandy became his
  carer. But this book is far from a descent into grief: it is full of humour
  and picaresque characters, Gerry among them. Kings Cross as it was, lurid and
  neon-lit, plays a starring role; Sayer’s habitat for decades. This is a writer
  at the height of her powers, telling a story she literally was born to write.
  – Susan Chenery Fierceland by Omar Musa Fiction, Penguin Random House, $34.99
  Part poetry, part prose, spoken word poet, rapper and artist Omar Musa’s
  second novel weaves together worlds and legacies. Siblings Roz and Harun
  return to Malaysian Borneo for their father’s funeral, only to confront the
  ghosts of the past. Told across times and places, the story traces the cost of
  choices made for future generations: “We give our lives so that our children
  will live. But how will they live?” Grappling with the devastation wrought by
  palm-oil plantations, violence and family estrangement, Musa asks whether old
  wounds can be healed and whether amends can ever be made. Bold and lyrical
  from the first page, Fierceland is a work of art. – Seren Heyman-Griffiths
  Desolation by Hossein Asgari Fiction, Ultimo Press, $34.99 A dishevelled
  stranger approaches a writer in an Adelaide cafe. “I have a story for you,”
  declares the man, who calls himself Amin. The writer is reluctant, but quickly
  finds himself compelled by Amin’s story, which unfolds in the aftermath of the
  Iran-Iraq war. This is the framing for Hossein Asgari’s second novel,
  Desolation, a bleak and urgent coming-of-age story that is narrated in a
  deceptively simple style. Teller and tale become entangled, the boundaries
  between truth and fiction erode, and bitter ironies abound. – Catriona
  Menzies-Pike Tenderfoot by Toni Jordan Fiction, Hachette Australia, $32.99
  Suburban Brisbane, 1975. Twelve-year-old Andie Tanner lives with her mother,
  her father and their four racing greyhounds. Andie dreams of becoming a
  greyhound trainer one day, and she’s pretty sure she has the future figured
  out. But as her family and friendships start to crumble, she begins to
  understand the complexity of human life. Tenderfoot captures the pain of
  growing up with intimacy and precision, and offers a poignant reflection on
  class and community. Told through alternating perspectives – adult and child –
  this is a gorgeous coming-of-age story about longing, loss and the persistence
  of childhood within us all. – Seren Heyman-Griffiths Cannon by Lee Lai Graphic
  novel, Giramondo Publishing, $39.95 When we meet Cannon, the titular
  protagonist of Lee Lai’s second graphic novel, she has just trashed the
  restaurant where she works. Shards of glass surround her, as do mysterious
  birds. Her longtime best friend Trish is the only person who witnesses the
  wreckage – a breakdown that has been a long time coming. Lai’s 2021 debut
  graphic novel, Stone Fruit, traced the dying days of a queer relationship;
  similar themes continue here with her sparing monochrome style and emotionally
  hefty dialogue. Questions of ethics in art, filial responsibility and the
  shifting tides of friendship weave their way through this thoughtful,
  sensitive story, with flashes of red-hot anger piercing through. – Giselle
  Au-Nhien Nguyen Inside Out by Kathleen Folbigg and Tracy Chapman Biography,
  Penguin Random House, $36.99 When Kathleen Folbigg and Tracy Chapman met as
  children in Kotara public school, the pair were not to know what life had in
  store for them. That Folbigg would lose four babies. That she would be
  convicted of their murder and manslaughter. That she would spend 20 years in
  prison. That Chapman would never waver, and would stand by her side,
  advocating for Folbigg for decades when the rest of Australia regarded her
  friend as a baby killer. Inside Out charts the course of the women’s lives,
  from childhood to conviction, imprisonment and ultimately exoneration. In
  chapters divided between Folbigg and Chapman, it tells a story of loyalty,
  justice and tremendous pain. – Celina Ribeiro Secret Sauce by Rosheen Kaul
  Cookbook, Murdoch Books, $39.99 A continent-hopping ode to condiments, Rosheen
  Kaul’s new recipe book includes 50 flavour-packed sauces, alongside 50 dishes
  that incorporate them. The award-winning author of Chinese-ish and former Etta
  chef is a wonderfully playful recipe writer, but the real innovation in this
  cookbook are not just the dishes, but the possibilities beyond them. Any of
  her sauces could be used to enliven an otherwise bland midweek meal, whether
  it be plain pasta, fried egg and rice, or meat and two vegetables. Most of the
  sauces keep for several days at least, so the book is a particular gift to
  meal preppers, in a beautifully photographed package. – Alyx Gorman Discipline
  by Randa Abdel-Fattah Fiction, University of Queensland Press, $34.99 This
  book may be a work of fiction, but it speaks a truth many have come to know:
  that to talk about Palestine in the west requires discipline and sacrifice.
  Set in Sydney during Israel’s attacks on Gaza during Ramadan in 2021,
  Discipline centres on two characters – journalist and young mother Hannah and
  academic Ashraf – as they navigate censorship, prejudice and apathy in two of
  society’s most contested areas: newsrooms and university campuses. With
  visceral detail, Randa Abdel-Fattah captures the pangs of survivor guilt and
  rage felt by first-generation Australians witnessing the destruction of their
  homelands while living in “the empire”, and the cost of speaking out against
  the status quo. – Nour Haydar Nature’s Last Dance: Tales of Wonder in an Age
  of Extinction by Natalie Kyriacou Nonfiction, Simon &amp; Schuster, $36.99
  Natalie Kyriacou’s ode to a natural world in decline is full of quirky
  stories, like the Great Emu Wars of the 1930s, the scientists exploring whale
  poo and Pablo Escobar’s menagerie. The environmentalist traverses the long,
  sad and weird arc of the history of humanity’s interactions with animals and
  the environment, to the point of mass extinction and collapse. Kyriacou is
  keen to emphasise the beauty that remains in the world, a reflection of her
  belief that changing course “begins with curiosity”. This is a book which
  leans into curiosity and and hope, while also mourning the damage done. –
  Celina Ribeiro The Farm by Jessica Mansour-Nahra Fiction, Hachette Australia,
  $24.99 There is an admirably nasty streak in this debut gothic novel. When
  37-year-old Leila has a miscarriage, then a devastating diagnosis, her
  boyfriend James encourages her to decamp with him to his family farm in
  O’Connell, New South Wales so she can recover. But the isolation is soon
  oppressive; Leila begins hearing noises and soon comes to suspect she is not
  the first woman James has brought to O’Connell. If you’ve read anything in the
  gothic tradition – particularly Jane Eyre and Rebecca – you’ll be coming into
  this book forewarned about many of the beats it hits – but it is still
  compelling. – Sian Cain Linger: Salads, Sweets and Stories to Savour, Together
  by Hetty Lui McKinnon Cookbooks, Pan Macmillan Australia, $44.99 Can salads be
  main dishes? Hetty Lui McKinnon believes they can, and has created 100 unique
  vegetarian salads in her latest book to prove just that. With flavours ranging
  from Chinese to Spanish, these dishes are not only filling but made to be
  shared – all having been road-tested by McKinnon, who hosted monthly lunches
  over the course of a year to see how these recipes were received by her
  friends. The book is broken up into 12 roughly seasonal menus that include not
  only the main-worthy salads but also little bites and sweet treats. Each menu
  also comes with a curated playlist – which can help set the atmosphere if you
  take on the mantle as host. – Isabella Lee
