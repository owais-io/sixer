  The first trailer for forthcoming drama Anemone has been released, offering a
  glimpse of Daniel Day-Lewis’s screen comeback after eight years. The triple
  Oscar-winner retired from acting in 2017 after completing Paul Thomas
  Anderson’s Phantom Thread which, he said, left him “overwhelmed by a sense of
  sadness” during filming. “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an
  actor,” read a statement at the time. “He is immensely grateful to all of his
  collaborators and audiences over the many years.” He had previously stepped
  back from the profession in 1997, after shooting The Boxer, when he took up a
  new career as a shoemaker in Italy. He then returned to make Gangs of New York
  with Martin Scorsese in 2002. Anemone is the debut feature of Day-Lewis’s son,
  Ronan, 27, who has previously worked primarily as a painter and made two short
  films, in 2016 and 2017. The two men co-wrote the script, which distributors
  describe as exploring “the complex and profound ties that exist between
  brothers, fathers, and sons”. The film has been produced by Brad Pitt’s Plan B
  outfit, and will premiere at the New York film festival in October. Widely
  perceived to be one of the finest actors of all time, Day-Lewis won Oscars for
  his roles in My Left Foot, Lincoln and There Will Be Blood. Other films
  include The Age of Innocence, My Beautiful Laundrette and The Last of the
  Mohicans. In 2005, Day-Lewis starred in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, directed
  by his wife (and Ronan’s mother), Rebecca Miller. Anemone is set in Yorkshire
  in the late 1980s and concerns the fate of two brothers who served as British
  paramilitaries in Northern Ireland 20 years before.
