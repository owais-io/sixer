  Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Card (Representative 53.3% APR Variable,
  Annual fee applies, 18+, Subject to status, terms and conditions apply) I love
  going on holiday but I’m not a fan of the packed itinerary, back-to-back
  excursions type of trip. To my mind, a holiday shouldn’t just be a change of
  scenery, but an escape. An escape from routine, an escape from the everyday,
  an escape from the general busyness of daily life. I want to get away, switch
  off, unwind and return refreshed, with a renewed sense of poise and purpose.
  ‘I find spending time in nature to be incredibly inspiring’ While it might
  sound like I’m asking for a lot from my holidays, it turns out I’m far from
  alone. According to Abta’s 2024-25 Holiday Habits report, three of the top
  five reasons people think holidays are important have to do with wellbeing. In
  at number one was “to relax”, with 73% of people saying this is the main
  reason they go away; meanwhile, 50% of respondents said that holidays are
  important “for my mental health and wellbeing”, while 46% said they like to
  get away “to escape the pressures of day-to-day life”. When you hear the
  phrase “wellbeing holiday” an image of an overseas retreat somewhere exotic
  often springs to mind. But that’s just part of the picture. There are all
  different types of wellbeing holidays and plenty of options closer to home,
  such as the Delta Hotels St Pierre Country Club in Chepstow, Wales – a
  14th-century manor house set in more than 160 hectares (400 acres) of
  picturesque parkland in the countryside of south Wales. Guests can check into
  a lakeside room for serene views from the moment they wake up, and then head
  into the spa, for massages, facials, manis and pedis – leaving them feeling
  thoroughly pampered. You can make the most of your escape by taking advantage
  of a Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card. As a Cardmember you will
  automatically be upgraded to Silver Elite status, which includes perks such as
  Priority Late Checkout (subject to availability) – leaving more time for
  relaxation. You’ll also be able to rack up points that can be redeemed for
  self-care and pampering, such as spa treatments, at hotels participating in
  Marriott Bonvoy. Delta Hotels St Pierre Country Club in Chepstow, Wales When
  it comes to wellbeing holidays, of course, there is seemingly a whole world
  waiting out there, meaning that it is not always easy to narrow your options
  down. But you could start by considering a trip to a Blue Zone – one of five
  places in the world where people consistently live over 100 years old – where
  wellbeing is in the air. These include three long-haul destinations: Okinawa,
  in Japan; the Nicoya Peninsula, in Costa Rica; and Loma Linda, in California.
  There are also two European spots: the islands of Sardinia, in Italy; and
  Ikaria, in Greece. Also, think about what experiences help you feel grounded.
  I find spending time in nature to be incredibly inspiring, so that has been a
  common thread through all of my wellbeing-focused trips. Clockwise from top

  Blue Zone destination for your next trip, Marriott Bonvoy offers a huge

  effectively paving the way for your next getaway. If you are after a luxurious
  break in a stunning overseas destination, El Mangroove, Autograph Collection,
  in the Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica, could be for you. Located on the Gulf of
  Papagayo close to Costa Rica’s Blue Zone region, this luxury beachfront resort
  has all the makings of a magical wellbeing retreat – surrounded by vibrant
  forests, lush mangroves and tropical gardens. The hotel runs daily yoga
  sessions and nature bike rides, while its spa offers treatments inspired by
  Costa Rica’s heritage of wellness practices. El Mangroove, Autograph
