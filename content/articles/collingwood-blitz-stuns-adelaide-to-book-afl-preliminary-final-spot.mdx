  Collingwood have produced 15 minutes of magic to sink Adelaide by 24 points in
  the AFL’s first qualifying final. The Pies booked a home preliminary final in
  a fortnight with a character-filled 11.13 (79) to 8.7 (55) victory at Adelaide
  Oval on Thursday night. Adelaide will host a home semi-final next week against
  GWS Giants or Hawthorn after being blitzed by the Magpies in the third
  quarter. After leading by six points at half-time, Collingwood booted five
  majors to none in a golden quarter-hour. The Pies’ 34-year-old veteran Steele
  Sidebottom triggered the onslaught with two left-footed snaps in a
  game-breaking burst. Sidebottom’s two left snaps – punctuated by a
  near-identical major from Jordan De Goey – came in four minutes that stunned
  the 52,187-strong pro-Adelaide crowd. The visitors scored five goals to three
  in what is widely-dubbed “the premiership quarter” – and the feat gives Craig
  McRae’s outfit inside running on the path to this year’s grand final. -
