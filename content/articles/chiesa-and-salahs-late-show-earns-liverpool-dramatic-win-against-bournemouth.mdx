  Liverpool opened the new Premier League season in triumph and in tears.
  Extreme emotions will accompany the champions throughout their title defence
  but were particularly apt on the night Anfield paid tribute to Diogo Jota and
  Arne Slot’s side showed the incredible will-to-win that defines them. Mohamed
  Salah was inconsolable after the final whistle. Moments after sealing an
  enthralling victory over Bournemouth and recreating Jota’s Baby Shark
  celebration, the Liverpool forward broke down in tears in front of the Kop as
  they sang in honour of the tragic Portugal international. Jota’s wife, Rute
  Cardoso, children and family had found the strength to be present and were
  welcomed with a sign that read: ‘Rute, Dinis, Duarte, Matilda – Anfield will
  always be your home. You’ll Never Walk Alone.’ It was one moving moment among
  many as Anfield remembered their number 20 and his brother, André Silva,
  following their deaths in July. The headlines could have belonged to Federico
  Chiesa, who came off the bench to clinch the win and shatter Bournemouth with
  an 88th-minute volley. It was his first Premier League goal for the club but,
  given the emotion, the high drama and unfortunately allegations of racist
  abuse towards Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, Chiesa’s vital contribution
  may be overlooked. Semenyo scored two excellent goals to haul Andoni Iraola’s
  team level, and deservedly so, only for Chiesa’s and Salah’s late double act
  to rescue Liverpool. Hugo Ekitiké, Liverpool’s recent £69m signing from
  Eintracht Frankfurt, impressed on his Premier League debut and opened the
  scoring. His touch, movement and pace ensured a seamless assimilation into the
  Liverpool attack but one look at Slot’s substitute bench, where his striking
  options consisted of Chiesa and 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha, underlined why
  interest in Alexander Isak remains. For all the additions to the Liverpool
  ranks and departures from the Bournemouth squad, however, it was the visitors
  who looked the more enterprising team prior to Ekitiké’s breakthrough.
  Bournemouth have sold Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi to the
  powerhouses of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively
  this summer for a combined £144.8m. Their absences told defensively, but
  Iraola will take comfort from the quality of his side’s overall display.
  Marcos Senesi was fortunate in the extreme to avoid a red card for denying a
  clear goalscoring opportunity with 13 minutes gone. Attempting to intercept a
  pass intended for Ekitiké, the Bournemouth central defender miscued a
  clearance from his thigh on to his fingertips before clawing the ball away
  from the Liverpool striker, who would have been through on goal. It was a
  clear handball, so clear that Cody Gakpo picked up the ball to await the
  inevitable punishment. Instead, referee Anthony Taylor awarded Bournemouth a
  free-kick for a handball by Gakpo. It was some escape. Slot was further
  enraged when Taylor waved play on after a trip on Florian Wirtz. Semenyo took
  possession and avoided a dangerous challenge from Kerkez before being tripped
  by Alexis Mac Allister. Moments later, as the Bournemouth forward shaped to
  take a throw-in, a Liverpool fan moved to the front of the Main Stand and
  berated him. Semenyo informed Taylor he had been racially abused and the game
  was paused as the match official called over both managers and stewards. The
  fan, in a wheelchair, was escorted out of the stadium at half-time by three
  police officers. Ekitiké gave Liverpool the lead shortly after the depressing
  incident when, having exchanged passes with Mac Allister, he ran at Senesi and
  benefited from a ricochet off the defender to race through on goal. The France
  under-21 international was coolness personified as he sent Djordje Petrovic to
  his right and rolled a finish past the keeper’s left. Gakpo doubled the
  champions’ advantage early in the second half when he received Ekitiké’s pass
  on the edge of the area and cut across two Bournemouth players before finding
  the bottom corner. Liverpool were in the comfort zone, and Bournemouth almost
  made them pay. Semenyo twice punished loose defending – and it had been a
  feature of their entire performance – to haul the visitors level. The Ghana
  international was unmarked as he swept home David Brooks’ low centre from the
  left. There was a sense of inevitability about Bournemouth’s equaliser and it
  arrived when Salah overhit a pass towards Dominik Szoboszlai. Hamed Traorè
  intercepted and released Semenyo, who set off from deep inside his own half
  and did not meet a challenge of note until reaching the edge of the Liverpool
  penalty area. The forward ended his outstanding run by finding the bottom
  corner of Alisson’s goal. How Salah made amends. It was his cross that caused
  pandemonium inside the Bournemouth box and resulted in Chiesa volleying
  Liverpool back in front. In stoppage time Salah registered his customary
  opening day goal to put the result beyond doubt with a piercing finish beyond
  Petrovic. The Egypt international celebrated wildly by his standards. The
  tears that followed underlined the importance of this night to all at
  Liverpool.
