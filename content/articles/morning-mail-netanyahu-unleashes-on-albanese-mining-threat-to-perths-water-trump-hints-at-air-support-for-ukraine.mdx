  Morning everyone. Benjamin Netanyahu has launched a vituperative attack on
  Anthony Albanese, calling the Australian prime minister a “weak politician”
  who had abandoned Israel. We have an exclusive on NSW selling huge chunks of
  land to private developers, and another exclusive on the threat to Perth’s
  water supply from strip mining. Donald Trump has hinted at air support for
  Ukraine, and we bring you the incredible story of a moving church. Australia
  Policy talk | A day into the long-awaited economic roundtable in Canberra, we
  bring you five takeaways from day one, and Josh Butler brings you the some of
  the atmosphere of the occasion. Bibi broadside | Benjamin Netanyahu has
  launched an extraordinary broadside against Anthony Albanese, labelling
  Australia’s prime minister “weak” in a social media post. Exclusive | The New
  South Wales government has sold more than two-thirds of publicly owned sites
  identified as surplus and suitable for housing to private developers as a
  result of its much-vaunted statewide property audit. AI blunder | A lawyer has
  been referred to Western Australia’s legal regulator after using artificial
  intelligence in preparing court documents for an immigration case. The
  documents contained AI-generated case citations for cases that did not exist.
  Water woes | Alcoa’s plan to vastly expand its strip mining of forest near
  Perth’s dams poses a high risk to the water supply for the city’s 2.3 million
  people, according to engineers. In NSW, environmental flows necessary to keep
  wetlands and fish healthy in the Murray-Darling have been stopped due to a
  legal stoush between the commonwealth and the state. World A moving sermon |
  After eight years of planning, a cost of more than 500m kronor ($80m) and an
  early morning blessing, a church in northern Sweden began a slow-motion 5km
  journey to make way for the expansion of Europe’s biggest underground mine.
  Ukraine doubts | Donald Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to
  enforce a potential peace deal with Vladimir Putin, but suggested American air
  power could be used to secure an agreement. Britian will tell the US it is
  ready to send troops to defend Ukraine’s skies and seas but not to the
  frontline with Russia. Our US commentator Sidney Blumenthal argues there is no
  Trump foreign policy doctrine, just chaos. Israel deadline | Israel has said
  it will deliver its response to international mediators by Friday over a new
  Gaza ceasefire plan accepted by Hamas amid mounting pressure for a truce in a
  war that has claimed more than 62,000 Palestinian lives. Rupert role | Guy
  Pearce will play Rupert Murdoch in director Danny Boyle’s screen adaptation of
  the award-winning play Ink based on the rise of the Australian media mogul’s
  empire. Trump tax | Household electricity bills have increased by 10% since
  Donald Trump re-entered the White House, a new report has found, with its
  authors highlighting the impact of the president’s data centre boosterism and
  cuts to clean energy projects as part of the cause. Full Story Zelenskyy suits
  up for peace, but can Trump deliver? The Guardian’s Washington bureau chief,
  David Smith, speaks to Nour Haydar about whether Europe’s united front can
  steer Trump away from the Kremlin. In-depth Although it is unlikely to be
  discussed at the second day of the government’s economic summit, the union
  suggestion that productivity gains could be translated into a four-day week
  has ignited business fury and much discussion. Patrick Commins analyses how
  the numbers stack up and whether we might in future choose between more time
  off and higher pay. Not the news An annual dance-off in the Victorian regional
  town of Castlemaine – Hot Moves No Pressure – is being celebrated as the
  perfect community event where people can watch their GP “getting sexy to
  Prince”. Jenny Valentish gets into the groove with Loves Fools, the
  Menowhores, Mainesplainers and many more. Sport Women’s rugby | From winger
  Desiree Miller to Olympic Sevens gold medallist Tia Hinds, we look at the five
  Wallaroos who could star in the World Cup. The sold-out final at Twickenham
  next month will have the biggest attendance ever for a game of women’s rugby –
  82,000. Cricket | The veteran spinner Keshav Maharaj bowled South Africa to a
  crushing 98-run win over Australia in the first ODI in Cairns last night with
  the hosts losing six wickets for 29 in a disastrous mid-innings collapse.
