  Coco Gauff walked off Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday night with eyes still
  wet and a clenched fist raised high. The world No 3 had lived through another
  serving ordeal, this time against Donna Vekić, yet she emerged intact –
  emotionally frayed but victorious – with a 7-6 (5), 6-2 win that lifted her
  into the third round of the US Open. The match was less a straight-line
  triumph than a public unravelling and recovery, a window into the
  psychological toll of remaking her most important shot in real time. Gauff’s
  seven double faults in the first set recalled the low points of her title
  defense last year, when 19 doomed her campaign. At 5-4 down, broken by two
  consecutive missed serves, she slumped into her chair shaking, buried her face
  in a towel and cried. “It feels human, I think,” she said later. “Being an
  athlete, people kind of disregard that side of us. People say, ‘You’re No 3 in
  the world, you should be better.’ But at the end of the day, if I didn’t pick
  up a racket tomorrow, I’ve had a career so many would dream of. Basically what
  you saw out there was what it was, and I was able to reset through it. It was
  a challenging moment for me on the court”. Reset she did. When Vekić called a
  medical timeout late in the first set for treatment on her right shoulder,
  Gauff stayed on court, hitting practice serves to the same spot as music
  blared for a nearly full house inside the world’s largest tennis stadium. The
  scene resembled an open-air lesson in biomechanics more than a major
  championship. “It’s tough changing everything before such a big tournament,”
  Gauff said. “But I know for the future this is the right step forward, and
  this is the biggest test of them all. It will only get easier from here”. The
  man responsible for the remodel, biomechanics coach Gavin MacMillan, has been
  at her side since shortly before the tournament. He previously worked with
  Aryna Sabalenka to rebuild her delivery and now finds himself in the glare of
  Gauff’s US Open. “He’s not a media guy,” Gauff said with a smile. “For me I
  just don’t want to let him down. He 100% knows what he’s doing”. Despite her
  crisis, Gauff clawed her way into a tiebreak, where her superior athleticism
  from the baseline finally tipped the balance. When Vekić flung a forehand long
  to surrender the set, Gauff’s mother leapt from her seat behind MacMillan,
  shouting: “Come on! Let’s go!” The release carried into the locker room
  between sets, where Gauff said that splashed water on her face and steadied
  her breathing. She returned looking composed. The second set told the story of
  a young player capable of compartmentalizing even as her serve betrays her.
  She hit just one double fault, held comfortably, and broke Vekić twice. The
  Croatian, who had beaten Gauff at last year’s Olympics en route to silver,
  faded under the strain of her arm trouble and her own rash of errors. Gauff
  closed the match with a crisp backhand winner on her second match point, this
  time sending a barbaric yawp skyward in celebration. If there was a turning
  point, it may have come from the stands. Among those in the Ashe crowd was
  Simone Biles, fresh off her own golden redemption at the Paris Olympics. Gauff
  spotted her between points and drew strength from the sight. “She’s on my
  Mount Rushmore of athletes with Serena,” Gauff said. “Everything she went
  through mentally is something I follow closely. To see her there tonight gave
  me the reminder I needed … I was lucky to just come from talking to her, so I
  was able to tell her that in person.” The two-time major champion has not
  hidden how fraught this week feels. A three-set struggle with Ajla Tomljanović
  in round one had already tested her nerve. “This is one of the most nervous
  tournaments for me in general, and on top of all this, it’s a lot,” she said.
  “There’s been a lot on me this time, more than usual. But I think today I
  showed that I can get up after feeling the worst I’ve ever felt on the court”.
  Even in acknowledging the pressure, Gauff leans on humor to survive. When an
  ESPN interviewer tried to brush off her comment that “at least my outfit
  looked good,” she doubled down. “Sometimes you have to be able to laugh at
  yourself,” she said with a grin. “Even after I lost at Wimbledon, I was like,
  well, it was a bad loss, but at least my outfit looked good, so it gave people
  something else to talk about. I’m not a fake positive person. If I’m positive,
  I mean it”. There is still plenty to fix – most of all the serve, a project
  likely to extend beyond New York – but Gauff believes the ordeal is shaping
  her into something tougher. “This whole tournament will stick with me the rest
  of my career,” she said. “If I can get through two tough matches feeling how
  I’m feeling, I know I can get through pretty much anything.” She next faces
  Magdalena Frech, the 28th seed from Poland. Whether her retooled motion can
  withstand another round of scrutiny will be the central question. For now,
  though, Gauff remains standing: shaken, tearful, but still very much in the
  fight.
