  Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin lavished praise on each other but offered no
  details of their nearly three-hour meeting in Alaska on Friday, with the US
  president saying “great progress” but no deal had been made on ending Russia’s
  war in Ukraine. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call up Nato …
  I’ll of course call up [Ukraine’s] President Zelenskyy and tell him about
  today’s meeting,” he said. Putin, speaking through an interpreter, described
  Trump’s efforts on Ukraine as “precious” and suggested the two leaders had
  hammered out “an understanding”. He urged Europe to “not throw a wrench in the
  works” and “not use backroom dealings” to torpedo it. As the press conference
  ended, Putin suggested their next meeting might take place in Moscow and
  dozens of reporters shouted questions in vain. The US president, who can
  typically never resist a free-wheeling press conference, left the stage
  without answering any of them. Here are the key US politics stories at a
  glance: No deal after brief Trump-Putin talks on Ukraine in Alaska Donald
  Trump left more questions than answers on Friday as he claimed “great
  progress” in his high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin, but said that no deal
  had been reached to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. “I believe we had a very
  productive meeting,” the US president said at a joint press conference in
  Anchorage, Alaska. “There were many, many points that we agreed on.” Read the

  fight. Former attorney general Eric Holder also joined the call. Read the full
