  Russian airstrikes have killed at least 12 people in a succession of attacks
  on Kyiv and wounded dozens in the most deadly night raid on the Ukrainian
  capital for several weeks. Three children, aged two, 14 and 17, were among
  those killed, officials said, in an onslaught that Ukraine’s president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said showed that Russia had no intention of negotiating
  an end to the war. “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear
  response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling
  for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said on social media. “Russia
  chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table.” A wave of strikes could
  be heard from the city centre after 3am and again at about 5.30am, with
  officials reporting impacts at more than 20 locations, including the
  destruction of part of a five-storey building in eastern Kyiv. Tymur
  Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said a 14-year-old girl
  and another child were among the dead. A total of 45 people had been counted
  as injured so far, he added. Three people were rescued from under the rubble
  of one of the sites, said Ihor Klymenko, the interior affairs minister, adding
  that rescue efforts were continuing in search of others who may be buried
  there. Aerial bombardment of Kyiv had been relatively muted during August,
  when the US president, Donald Trump, made a failed attempt to bring about an
  end to the war by meeting his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska.
  But the overnight attack indicated Russia was ready to return to its deadly
  campaign, with Ukrainian officials reporting that the capital was targeted by
  ballistic and cruise missiles as well as Shahed drones. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali
  Klitschko, said during the night that a “massive attack on the capital” was
  taking place. Air defence forces were operating, he said, urging residents to
  remain in shelters for their protection. Zelenskyy said there should be an
  international response and called for further sanctions against Russia,
  including from China, an ally of Moscow. “We expect a reaction from China to
  what is going on. China has repeatedly called for not expanding the war and
  for a ceasefire,” he added. Hours earlier, Beijing said Putin would be among
  the leaders attending a military parade with President Xi Jinping in Beijing
  next week.
