  Jeremy Strong is reportedly the leading choice to play Mark Zuckerberg in the
  upcoming sequel to The Social Network. According to Deadline and Variety,
  sources claim that though no formal offer has been made, the Succession actor
  is the preferred pick to play the Meta CEO and Facebook founder in The Social
  Network Part II, alongside The Bear’s Jeremy Allen White and Anora’s Mikey
  Madison in unspecified roles. Aaron Sorkin, who won a best adapted screenplay
  Oscar for the first film, will write and direct the new entry after years of
  tinkering with a new angle to the story of Facebook. David Fincher directed
  the 2010 film, which starred Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg alongside Andrew
  Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer and Rashida Jones. The Social
  Network Part II, confirmed to be in development this June, will reportedly not
  be a straightforward sequel to the story of Facebook’s founding in a Harvard
  dorm room, but rather a follow-up focusing on recent controversy surrounding
  the social media behemoth. The new screenplay will be based on reporting by
  Jeff Horowitz for the Wall Street Journal in a series called The Facebook
  Files, which explored the inner workings and harm caused by the company. The
  2021 investigation exposed how internal findings had been buried, as well as
  Facebook’s influence on the January 6 riot and the mental health of teenage
  users. Deadline reports that White would ideally play Horowitz, with Madison –
  fresh off her best actress Oscar win this March – playing the whistleblower at
  the heart of the articles. Sorkin had previously teased more overt political
  leanings for the new script. “I blame Facebook for January 6,” he said in 2024
  on a special edition of The Town podcast, live from Washington DC. When asked
  to explain why, he responded: “You’re gonna need to buy a movie ticket.
  “Facebook has been, among other things, tuning its algorithm to promote the
  most divisive material possible,” Sorkin said. He added: “There is supposed to
  be a constant tension at Facebook between growth and integrity – there isn’t.”
  The Social Network, based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben
  Mezrich, made $224m worldwide in 2010 and won three Oscars – best adapted
  screenplay, original score and editing. Eisenberg, who was nominated for his
  starring role, is yet to be attached to the new project. In a recent podcast
  interview, Zuckerberg was critical of the film, which portrayed him as
  calculating and ruthless. “It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these
  very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct,
  but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff
  were, like, completely wrong.” Strong received an Emmy for his portrayal of
  Succession’s Kendall Roy on the acclaimed HBO series, among many other
  accolades. He was nominated for an Oscar this year for playing the fearsome
  attorney and Donald Trump mentor Roy Cohn in The Apprentice, Ali Abbasi’s film
  tracing the young Trump’s rise in 1980s New York. He will next appear on
  screen alongside White in the Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me from
  Nowhere, playing the record producer and Springsteen collaborator Jon Landau.
