  Indonesia has delayed plans to publish a set of controversial history books
  amid backlash from historians and activists who have accused the project of
  being an attempt to downplay past atrocities, and represents “historical
  amnesia”. In May Indonesia’s culture minister Fadli Zon announced the planned
  release of a 10-volume “official history” project. The set of new books would
  remove colonial bias, feature updated research, promote national pride and
  have a “positive” tone, he said. But the initiative sparked fears the books
  may omit significant events in Indonesia’s history, including those involving
  the president, Prabowo Subianto. The release, initially set for Indonesia’s
  independence day on 17 August, has now been pushed back to November. Prabowo,
  the ex-son-in-law of former dictator Suharto, was dismissed from the military
  in 1998 amid allegations he was involved in the kidnappings of pro-democracy
  activists. He has always denied wrongdoing, saying he was acting under orders.
  Historians and researchers who have seen early drafts say the new texts gloss
  over these events, and also appear to downplay and omit major human rights
  violations, including the killings of up to half a million suspected
  communists from 1965-6, and mass rapes targeting ethnic Chinese during the
  riots that led to the fall of Suharto in 1998. No drafts of the history texts
  have been released publicly. The minister did not immediately respond to
  questions from the Guardian about the history books. Critics say the new books
  are part of broader trend of historical revisionism under Prabowo, which
  include plans to name Suharto a national hero, and officially mark Prabowo’s
  birthday “National Culture Day”. Marzuki Darusman, a former Indonesian
  attorney general turned rights campaigner, said the planned rewrite risked a
  return to the governance that characterised the Suharto era, when historical
  narratives were tightly controlled. He dismissed the culture minister’s idea
  that the country’s written history should have a “positive” tone. “How can you
  be positive about these things?” he asked. Activist Ita Fatia Nadia, described
  the project as “amnesia history”, saying it was an “attempt to whitewash and
  cleanse” Indonesian history of rights violations. Historian and opposition MP
  Bonnie Triyana criticised what he said was the project’s secrecy, “flawed
  methodology” and political bias. In comments to the Indonesian media, the
  culture minster has defended the process, saying public reviews were held at
  four universities and more would follow. The controversy coincides with
  another flashpoint in the world’s third-largest democracy this month. Ahead of
  independence day, when Indonesia’s red and white flag typically adorns
  streets, offices, schools and government buildings, young Indonesians are
  instead hoisting black pirate flags in protest. The movement to fly the “One
  Piece” or Jolly Roger anime flag is being seen as a critique on the decline of
  democratic freedoms under Prabowo, including attacks on the press, and the
  rise of the military in civilian affairs. Prabowo has said he has no issue
  with the flag as long as it is not raised above the national flag, but
  parliamentarians and the police have expressed outrage. “Young Indonesians
  have found a unique tactic for political critique – using a pop culture icon
  deeply embedded in youth culture,” said Dominique Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher
  from the center for strategic and international studies. “Indonesia’s
  democracy is now essentially treading water, if not regressing,” he added, “As
  authoritarian mindsets and tactics have moved into the mainstream.”
