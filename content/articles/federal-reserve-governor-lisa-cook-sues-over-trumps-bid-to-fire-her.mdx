  Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit claiming Donald Trump
  has no authority to fire her. The lawsuit – filed by Cook in federal court in
  Washington on Thursday – sets the stage for a legal battle over the US
  president’s extraordinary bid for greater control of the central bank. The
  complaint was not immediately available. Trump tried to dismiss Cook on
  Monday, announcing that he was removing her from her position on the Fed’s
  board of governors “effective immediately” over an unconfirmed allegation from
  one of his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she
  incorrectly described as her primary residence. But Cook stood her ground,
  arguing Trump had “no authority” to fire her. “I will continue to carry out my
  duties to help the American economy,” she said. Her attorney indicated she
  would file a lawsuit. For months, Trump has publicly urged the Fed to cut
  interest rates, attacking the central bank – and its chair Jerome Powell –
  over its refusal to do so. Policymakers have stressed the need to wait and see
  the impact of the administration’s policies, such as tariffs and deportations,
  before approving a cut. Cook’s exit would allow Trump to tap a replacement,
  helping him exert more control over Fed policy. He suggested on Tuesday that
  he would “have a majority” on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors “very
  shortly”, adding: “We have to get the rates down a little bit.” The Trump
  administration has pursued several of the president’s political enemies,
  including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the California
  senator Adam Schiff, over claims of mortgage fraud. Both James and Schiff have
  denied the allegations. Cook is not a politician, but is among a string of
  senior Fed policymakers who have defied Trump’s persistent calls for rate
  cuts. She became the first Black woman to sit on the central bank’s board when
  she was appointed to a term that was not due to end until 2038. A respected
  economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, Cook
  served on the council of economic advisers under Barack Obama.
