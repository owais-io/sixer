  Terence Stamp, who has died aged 87, was a leading cultural figure of the
  Swinging Sixties. Despite his extensive and varied work in the decades that
  followed, the strikingly handsome British actor will always be associated with
  that exhilarating period, when he was in demand by some of the best directors
  of the day. Born in Stepney, east London, Terence was the eldest of five
  children of Ethel (nee Perrott) and Thomas Stamp, a tugboat captain. He was
  fortunate that his career began at the time when it helped an actor to have
  working-class origins. Following Michael Caine, Albert Finney and Tom
  Courtenay, the cockney Stamp was catapulted into stardom in his early 20s,
  enjoying all the accoutrements that went with celebrity. This included a
  romance with Julie Christie, and a three-year relationship with the top
  fashion model Jean Shrimpton, who made headlines when she left the
  photographer David Bailey for him. Stamp spent his early years in the East end
  until the blitz forced the family to move to Plaistow, then in Essex. As his
  father was away for long periods in the Merchant Navy, Terence and his
  siblings were brought up mostly by their mother, grandmother and aunts. On
  leaving Plaistow grammar school, Stamp worked in several advertising agencies
  in London, all the time wanting to be an actor. But, as he recalled: “It
  wasn’t until I saw James Dean in East of Eden that I began to think that maybe
  I could actually do this.” He then applied for and won a scholarship to the
  Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in South Kensington. He had a spell as
  assistant stage manager, then actor, with a repertory company in Devon, before
  making his London stage debut in A Trip to the Castle at the Arts Theatre, in
  1960. However, more important, in the same year, was the four-month tour in
  Willis Hall’s second world war army drama The Long and the Short and the Tall,
  in which the 21-year-old Stamp played Private Sammy Whitaker, the callow
  wireless operator, with 27-year-old Caine as the rebellious private “Bammo”
  Bamforth. The two Londoners struck up a friendship and moved together into a
  flat. It was the younger actor who first broke into the big time when Peter
  Ustinov, looking for a handsome young man to play the title role of the
  ill-fated seaman in his film version of Herman Melville’s Billy Budd (1962),
  cast the unknown Stamp, more on the strength of his appearance than his
  experience. Ustinov’s gamble paid off because Stamp, whose dark hair was dyed
  blond for the role, managed to convey the essence of Melville’s stammering
  angelic innocent, and gain himself a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.
  At the same time, he was seen in the far-from-angelic part of the school bully
  in Term of Trial (1962). In December 1964, Stamp went to Broadway to star in
  Bill Naughton’s Alfie but, despite good reviews, the play ran for only 21
  performances. (Although he was offered the chance to star in the film version
  of the play, Stamp turned it down, recommending his pal, Caine.) Instead, he
  was handed a plum role in William Wyler’s The Collector (1965), an adaptation
  of the bestselling novel by John Fowles. He played a warped office clerk and
  amateur lepidopterist who kidnaps a young art student (Samantha Eggar) in the
  hope that she will come to love him. In truth, the character of the
  “collector” worked better on the page, but Stamp was touchingly shy and gauche
  and won the best actor award at that year’s Cannes festival. Stamp then sent
  up his modish image in Joseph Losey’s Modesty Blaise (1966), playing Willie
  Garvin, the cockney, knife-throwing sidekick of Monica Vitti’s eponymous sexy
  spy. The next year, he appeared as the swaggering sword-brandishing Sergeant
  Troy in John Schlesinger’s adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s Far from the Madding
  Crowd, and then adjusted to the miserabilist “kitchen-sink” realism of Ken
  Loach’s Poor Cow. In this other side of the London coin, Stamp was touching as
  the sensitive but irresponsible lover of Carol White, as Joy. In 1968, after
  unwisely starring as a Mexican bandit in the turgid western Blue – the title
  refers to the colour of the hero’s eyes – Stamp gave two extraordinary
  performances in two extraordinary films in Italy, one exploiting the satanic
  side of his beauty and the other the angelic side. In the Federico Fellini
  episode from Spirits of the Dead (three tales by Edgar Allan Poe), called Toby
  Dammit, Stamp plays a film star who, after making a movie in Rome, gets very
  drunk and is pursued by the devil while speeding around the Eternal City in
  his Maserati. According to Stamp: “Fellini embodied the transcendent. He was
  more than a great director, he was like the guru.” In Pier Paolo Pasolini’s
  Teorema, Stamp convinced as a handsome young man who ingratiates himself into
  the home of a rich industrialist and sleeps with every member of the family –
  the father, the mother, the daughter, the son and the maid. This fable set out
  to prove that once the family was liberated from its bourgeois existence by
  the mysterious young stranger, it goes mad because sex is the one thing it
  cannot control. The film was the apotheosis of Stamp, the 60s sex symbol.
  During his sojourn in Italy, Stamp was perfectly cast as French poète maudit
  Arthur Rimbaud in Nelo Risi’s A Season in Hell (1971), but by the time it was
  released, he had taken off for India, seemingly because of the breakup of his
  relationship with Shrimpton. “That’s what turned me inwards,” he remembered.
  “If I’d just been a little bit more dumb, I would have chased after the next
  supermodel.” Stamp made occasional appearances in films during the next eight
  years, and spent long periods at an ashram in Pune, in Maharashtra, India,
  meditating and studying the teachings of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. After being
  almost invisible for a decade, Stamp, his good looks and his charisma intact,
  returned to the limelight as the arrogant arch villain General Zod in Superman
  (1978) and Superman II (1980). Stamp derived much amusement from the evil
  comic book character by adopting a calm, detached attitude to his acts of
  destruction, almost bored with the ease with which he and his two cohorts have
  taken over the Earth. From then on Stamp was back in the consciousness of
  audiences, mainly as a villain – General Zod being the prototype – appearing
  in an average of two or three films a year, some good, some best forgotten. In
  Stephen Frears’s The Hit (1984), he is a British ex-con exiled in Spain; in
  Oliver Stone’s Wall Street (1987), he is Sir Larry Wildman – the nemesis of
  the stock market speculator Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) – who lends the
  word “mate” an emphasis of menace, and in the title role of Steven
  Soderbergh’s The Limey (1999), he is another ex-con, this time seeking revenge
  for the murder of his daughter. In the latter, there is an ingenious and
  moving moment when Soderbergh cuts in an extract from Poor Cow as a flashback
  to the character’s youth. All at once we see the contrast between the
  28-year-old and the balding, grey-haired, 60-year-old actor. In a departure
  from anything he had ever done before, Stamp dragged up for Stephan Elliott’s
  1994 cult comedy classic The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert
  (1994), playing Bernadette Bassenger, a trans woman and performer who joins
  two drag queens on a road trip across the Australian outback – with lines such
  as: “I’ll join this conversation on the proviso that we stop bitching about
  people, talking about wigs, dresses, bust sizes, penises, drugs, night clubs,
  and bloody Abba!” Stamp’s fan base was considerably added to with an
  appearance, albeit a short one, in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace
  (1999) as Chancellor Valorum. In 2008, he played one of the conspirators
  planning to assassinate Hitler in Valkyrie, which starred Tom Cruise as
  Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, each actor using his own accent. Stamp also
  provided the voice of Jor-El, aka Superman’s dad, in 19 episodes of the TV
  series Smallville from 2003 to 2011. In Song for Marion (2012), a
  “sweet-natured, if modestly conceived” comedy-drama about a choir of
  sixtysomethings, he played the curmudgeonly Arthur, persuaded to join in the
  singing by his terminally ill wife Marion (Vanessa Redgrave). Other later
  films included the heist caper The Art of the Steal (2014), and Tim Burton’s
  time-loop fantasy Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (2016), adapted
  from the bestselling novel by Ransom Riggs. He made a guest appearance in the
  television series of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials in 2020 and his last
  film role was in Edgar Wright’s psychological horror Last Night in Soho
  (2021). In addition to his acting, Stamp published four volumes of memoirs,
  and a cookbook to provide alternative recipes for those, like him, who are
  wheat and dairy intolerant. In 2002, Stamp married Elizabeth O’Rourke, an
  Australian pharmacist. They were divorced a little more than five years later.
