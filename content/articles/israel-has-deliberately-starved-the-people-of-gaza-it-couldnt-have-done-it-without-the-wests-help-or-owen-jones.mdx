  What have we done? As the UN-backed monitor declares that “the worst-case
  scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip”, this should
  have been the question ricocheting between the walls as Keir Starmer met
  Donald Trump this week. Israel’s deliberate starvation of Gaza is, after all,
  a crime confessed to, designed and implemented in plain sight. Starmer has
  said the UK will recognise Palestinian statehood if Israel doesn’t agree to a
  ceasefire and a two-state solution, but don’t be beguiled: Palestinian
  national self-determination is an inalienable right, not a bargaining chip,
  and it’s the most symbolic action he could take rather than, say, imposing
  sweeping sanctions and ending all arms sales. The hand-wringing of western
  politicians and media outlets will not feed Gaza’s emaciated children, any
  more than it will absolve them of guilt. Israel’s leaders have said,
  explicitly, repeatedly, from the very beginning, that they are deliberately
  starving Gaza’s people. “Man-made famine is not something that I’ve seen in my
  lifetime,” Martin Griffiths, the UN’s former humanitarian chief, tells me. On
  9 October 2023, Israel’s then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, announced “a
  complete siege on [Gaza]: no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel”,
  justified on the grounds: “We are fighting human animals and we act
  accordingly”. The next day, the Israeli general charged with humanitarian
  affairs in Gaza and the West Bank – Ghassan Alian – declared that the
  “citizens of Gaza” were “human beasts” who would suffer “a total blockade on
  Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get
  hell.” The following week, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
  promised “we will not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and
  medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip”. These statements were not
  reported at all by many western media outlets – or, if they were, it was in
  passing and with no explanation given about their objectively illegal intent.
  It’s as though these statements were being uttered in a parallel universe,
  because if they were accurately covered with due prominence, then our media
  would have been forced to cover Israel’s onslaught as a criminal enterprise,
  rather than a war of self-defence. Israel’s western allies knew exactly what
  it was up to. In March 2024, our then foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, wrote a
  letter setting out many ruses used by Israel to block aid from entering Gaza,
  yet Britain took no action. In April 2024, two US government departments
  concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking aid, which legally required
  the administration to stop supplying weapons. This was overruled by Joe
  Biden’s team. Later that year, that same administration sent a public letter
  detailing Israeli aid obstructions, but Tel Aviv correctly calculated this was
  political posturing during the presidential election, largely ignored the
  demands and suffered no consequences for doing so. Israel has perpetrated the
  biggest slaughter of aid workers in history, killing more than 400 by the
  spring. It waged a relentless war against Gaza’s main humanitarian agency –
  Unrwa, the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency – and banned it from the occupied
  territories last October. Its military killed police officers charged with
  escorting aid and preventing looting. It’s not just the blocking of aid from
  entering. Israel’s onslaught has left nearly all agricultural land unusable,
  as well as damaging 80% of cropland. Nearly all livestock and most plant life
  is dead. Gaza’s port and fishing vehicles have been destroyed, and
  Palestinians defying Israel’s ban on fishing face slaughter. The massacre of
  starving Palestinians looking for aid has been a consistent theme. In February
  2024, more than a hundred civilians waiting for flour were butchered by the
  Israeli military, yet – as been the case throughout the genocide – media
  outlets treated its denials, deflections and lies as credible claims. A
  detailed investigation by CNN weeks later concluded what should always have
  been obvious – the Israeli military was to blame – but by then attention had
  moved elsewhere. In March this year, Israel imposed a total siege, and
  replaced the UN’s effective aid system with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,
  whose “distribution sites” are dystopian killing fields. As the UN-backed IPC
  notes, that aid is not only far too little, but it is often unusable because
  Israel has left Palestinians without cooking gas and clean water to prepare
  it. More than a thousand civilians have been butchered trying to access this
  aid. As aid agencies have noted, the GHF is designed to coax a starved
  population to the south, so they can be confined in what the former Israeli
  prime minister Ehud Olmert described as a “concentration camp”, before being
  deported. Despite Israel’s obvious, transparent, shameless guilt, its lies are
  indulged by western politicians and media outlets. On Monday, Donald Trump
  repeated that “a lot of the food is stolen” by Hamas. This lie has been
  contradicted by Cindy McCain, director of the World Food Programme, and widow
  to the hawkishly pro-Israel late Republican senator John McCain. An internal
  US government analysis found no proof, and Israeli officials have briefed that
  their military reached the same conclusion. Perversely, it is criminal gangs
  backed by Israel – which Netanyahu’s own former deputy noted are linked to
  Islamic State – that are stealing aid. The international criminal court’s
  arrest warrants, issued eight months ago, centred on Israel’s deliberate
  starvation for a reason: the evidence is overwhelming. Yet even if Gaza were
  suddenly flooded with aid, many Palestinians would die because their bodies
  have been irreversibly ravaged by hunger. And that is not even on the agenda.
  The 73 trucks allowed in on Monday were forced to take an unsafe route, and
  then looted. Our own prime minister has been promoting airdrops of aid. These
  are pinpricks, badly targeted and have killed Palestinians when they’ve fallen
  on their heads. All they really achieve is cover for Israel, to pretend it is
  doing something, deflecting from its deliberate mass starvation. But what else
  should we expect from Starmer, who backed Israel’s right to impose a siege on
  Gaza at the beginning of the genocide, then tried to gaslight us into
  believing he hadn’t? What have we done? If western elites had any shame, this
  question would be robbing them of sleep. And the answer would be
  straightforward. You facilitated the mass starvation of an entire people. You
  knew what was happening, because of a deluge of evidence for 21 months, and
  because the perpetrator – your friend – repeatedly boasted to the world about
  its crime. Alas, the architects of this abomination will not hold themselves
  to account. That will be left to history – and the courts. Owen Jones is a
