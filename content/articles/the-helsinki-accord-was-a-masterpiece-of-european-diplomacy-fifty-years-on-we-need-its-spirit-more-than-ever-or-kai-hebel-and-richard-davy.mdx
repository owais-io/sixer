  Vladimir Putin will probably never give up on his attempts to bring Ukraine
  into Russia – which is where it belongs, according to his warped view of
  history. Those who oppose him tend to fall out of windows or suffer other
  “accidents” or go to prison. If he agrees to a ceasefire, it will be only to
  gain time to replenish his forces before trying again. All that would stop him
  then would be armed peacekeepers of some kind, as is already being discussed.
  If someone replaces him from his inner circle, there is unlikely to be change.
  However, somewhere well-hidden in Moscow, there must be people yearning for
  real peace, which would include recognising Ukraine as a sovereign country,
  just as during the cold war there were people fairly well-hidden in the
  communist establishment who yearned for democracy. They got their chance when
  Mikhail Gorbachev became leader in 1985. Sadly, the chance was bungled. While
  waiting with slender hopes for the appearance of these benign forces, it is
  worth reminding everyone that there is an organisation in place with many of
  the skills and machinery for promoting democracy and peace in Europe. This is
  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is about
  to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding document, generally known as
  “the Helsinki final act”. The accord was signed in the Finnish capital on 1
  August 1975 by 35 presidents, prime ministers and other leaders from both
  sides of the iron curtain: all of Europe, east and west, plus the Soviet
  Union, the United States and Canada. Only Maoist Albania declined Finland’s
  invitation to explore how adversaries, armed to the teeth with nuclear and
  conventional weapons, could find some common ground as the basis for eventual
  peace. The adoption of the Helsinki final act was the dramatic and unexpected
  product of nearly three years of intense negotiation. Moscow and its allies
  wanted to put a seal on the postwar order in Europe, including the division of
  Germany and Soviet rule over the unhappy people of central and eastern Europe.
  During those three years, however, it was turned around, mainly by the nine
  members of the European community – in which Britain played an important role
  – to become instead an exciting agenda for change. The final act allowed
  frontiers to be changed by peaceful means, thereby keeping open the road to
  German (and Irish) unification. It committed signatories to increase military
  transparency through a catalogue of “confidence-building measures”, and it
  defined an ambitious set of activities to facilitate trade, cultural contacts
  and the freer movement of people and information “of all kinds”. Most
  significantly of all, as it turned out, it pledged signatories to “respect
  human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought,
  conscience, religion or belief”, stipulating that this was an essential basis
  for peace in Europe. In the following years, the authoritarian governments
  that signed the final act made only small, grudging moves towards implementing
  those pledges. But they were eagerly taken up by dissidents, who collected
  thick dossiers of abuses of human rights to present to liberal governments and
  pressure groups, which then forced the Soviet Union to accept human rights as
  a subject for negotiation. In other words, a factor in mutual security was how
  governments treat their people. This was an important innovation in
  international diplomacy. Gradually this intense activity around human rights
  in the Soviet empire helped to punch holes in the iron curtain, weaken the
  regimes and lay some of the groundwork for the peaceful ending of the cold
  war. This became known as the “Helsinki effect”. The legitimacy of the final
  act derived from the fact that it was not a stitch-up between great powers but
  the result of 35 states negotiating doggedly until they reached consensus.
  Will there be another “Helsinki effect”? Not in that form, and certainly not
  immediately, as repression in Putin’s Russia is harsher than that of the
  ailing Soviet Union in its dying days. The Russian president has also severely
  weakened the OSCE by violating most of its pledges, including its foundational
  commitments to international peace and the nonviolent settlement of disputes.
  Yet the world’s largest regional security organisation continues to operate,
  now with 57 participating states and a dozen missions in the field run from a
  secretariat in Vienna and an office for democratic institutions and human
  rights in Warsaw. While often overlooked by the media, it still does valuable
  work promoting human rights, conflict prevention and honest elections.
  Importantly, the OSCE remains uniquely inclusive – it is the sole regional
  organisation of which Ukraine, the US and Russia are members – and it
  possesses longstanding experience and considerable expertise in promoting
  cooperation. It has the potential to help broker and monitor a peace agreement
  to end the war in Ukraine when the time is right. On Thursday, member states
  will congregate in Helsinki to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the final
  act, in the same Finlandia Hall where it was signed. The accord was a
  masterpiece of diplomacy and a milestone in European history whose vision
  remains as relevant as ever: a peaceful and cooperative Europe whose
  governments respect international law and protect human rights. Its
  institutional offspring, the OSCE, cannot realise this noble vision by itself,
  but it remains an important vehicle for seeking peace through diplomacy. Kai
