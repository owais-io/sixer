  A key work by the Turner prize-winning British artist Chris Ofili featuring
  his signature use of elephant dung is to be put up for auction for the first
  time at Christie’s in October. Blossom (1997), a portrait created a year
  before Ofili became the first black artist to win the Turner prize in 1998, is
  estimated to sell for £1m to £1.5m. The piece blends sacred iconography with
  popular culture and African symbolism, using Ofili’s signature materials of
  glitter, resin and elephant dung. Tessa Lord, the head of postwar and
  contemporary art at Christie’s London, which is selling the work on 15
  October, said: “This is one of the most exciting paintings that I’ve worked
  with in a long time. Ofili’s works are large-scale works that are rare to
  auction.” Ofili’s painting will come under the hammer alongside four works by
  the Scottish painter Peter Doig, which will also be offered at auction for the
  first time: Ski Jacket, Country Rock, Concrete Cabin and Yara. Other notable
  works in the collection include 1981-82 by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Hon (She)
  by the Swedish artist Karin Mamma Andersson. Ofili, who was born in Manchester
  and is of Nigerian descent, studied at the Chelsea College of Arts and the
  Royal College of Art. In 2003, Ofili represented Britain at the Venice
  Biennale. He is based between London, New York and Trinidad. Blossom was
  exhibited in 2010 as part of Ofili’s mid-career retrospective at Tate Britain,
  the most extensive display of his work to date. It was also included in the
  2014-15 survey at the New Museum in New York. The painting draws upon
  traditional ideas of the mother and child, depicting a woman with an exposed
  breast, crowned by an orange flower placed in her afro. On the left-hand side,
  the painting’s title, Blossom, is vertically spelled out, inscribed into
  spheres of elephant dung. “The surface is extraordinary,” said Lord. “It’s got
  these almost pointillist textured dots all over the surface and resin that
  creates these layers that are really, in person, quite beautiful.” The piece
  was from an important year in the artist’s career, said Lord. Ofili’s 1997
  solo exhibition, which showcased in the Southampton City Art Gallery, the
  Serpentine Gallery in London and the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester,
  “cemented his nomination on to the Turner prize in 1998, which he won”. As
  well as being the first black artist to win the prize, Ofili was the first
  painter in more than a decade to win the award. “Previously it had been quite
  conceptual, so Ofili really represents the strength of British painting in
  that 90s, early 2000s moment.” The collection is owned by Ole Faarup, a late
  Danish design entrepreneur and philanthropist who acquired Blossom in 1997.
  The entire collection was assembled over a period of 50 years. All proceeds
  will go to the Ole Faarup Art Foundation, which aims to support young Danish
  and international artists by placing their works in museums around the world.
  “The masterpieces in the collection are the works by two British artists,”
  said Lord. Ofili and Doig had a “personal connection”. Having first met as
  students at Chelsea College of Arts, Doig would later stay with Ofili in
  Trinidad in the early 2000s, an experience that inspired the work Yara, which
  is up for auction in the collection. Ofili’s style is often considered “punk
  art” and is influenced by artists such as Basquiat and Philip Guston. His work
  has garnered attention for its brazenness and provocation, particularly for
  the frequent use of elephant dung and pornographic imagery. His painting The
  Holy Virgin Mary attracted controversy in 1998 for its depiction of a Black
  Madonna surrounded by images from blaxploitation films and pornographic
  magazines. It was sold for £2.9m at Christie’s. “We really haven’t had
  something like this or a work of this quality since 2015 when we sold The Holy
  Virgin Mary,” said Lord.
