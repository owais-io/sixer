  Police in eastern Spain have arrested three people and seized 11 litres of
  ayahuasca, 117 San Pedro cactus plants and several bottles of toad poison
  after raiding two rural properties that were used to host lucrative spiritual
  retreats promising “astral journeys”. Officers from the Guardia Civil force
  began investigating the business in the Pedreguer municipality of Alicante
  province five months ago after receiving a complaint from a former customer.
  They discovered that the retreat, which advertised online and billed itself as
  an award-winning and internationally renowned spiritual centre, offered
  “traditional curative medicine” breaks that were especially popular among
  European visitors. “The three-day and five-day packages on offer cost an
  average of €1,000 [£865] and included lodgings, support and the substances to
  be taken,” the force said in a statement. “The retreats comprised groups of up
  to 20 people, who were accompanied on their ‘astral journeys’ by six of the
  organisation’s employees. Several such retreats took place each week, leading
  investigators to conclude that the group made hundreds of thousands of euros
  over the past year – most of which was paid in cash that was not declared and
  which therefore left no trace. A large number of bank accounts in different
  countries were used.” The Guardia Civil said 16 people had been on a retreat
  when the raids took place, adding that the centre did not have the necessary
  equipment to deal with cases of poisoning and that the concoctions were
  prepared in a “homemade, rudimentary laboratory that lacked hygiene measures”.
  A Guardia Civil spokesperson said that ayahuasca, San Pedro, toad poison, wild
  rue and mimosa pudica were prohibited substances in Spain, adding that their
  consumption was not authorised because, while they were natural substances,
  they could be highly dangerous to human health. Police photographs showed a
  large room, filled with mattresses, buckets and tissues, where the “astral
  journeys” took place. Two men and a woman – thought to be the group’s leaders
  – were arrested, while five others who served as “spiritual guides” are under
  investigation. All are suspected of drug trafficking, money laundering and
  belonging to a criminal organisation. Officers also seized 945 Ritalin tablets
  as well as an assortment of plant products, all of which were sent to the
  laboratory for testing. While the Guardia Civil has not suggested that anyone
  was physically harmed as a result of the centre’s activities, they stated:
  “Ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, toad secretions, wild rue and mimosa pudica are
  naturally derived products that can be highly damaging for humans and whose
  effects are difficult to predict because they depend on various factors,
  including an individual’s metabolism and the amounts administered. That risk
  increases when the toxic substances are administered by people who lack
  healthcare training and when they are produced in a homemade fashion.”
