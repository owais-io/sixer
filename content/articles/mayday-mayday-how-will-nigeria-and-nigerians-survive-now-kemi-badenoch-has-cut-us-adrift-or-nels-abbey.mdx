  Paul Mooney, the late great African-American comedian and one of the most
  insightful yet hilarious intellectuals on matters of race, once quipped that
  every “racially aggrieved” person once deceased returns in another body to
  collect what is owed to them. Illustrating the point he suggested that the
  first Black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel (perhaps most famous for playing
  Mammy in Gone With the Wind), had returned to the world as Oprah Winfrey. If
  Mooney’s thesis is to be believed, there is amusement to be had guessing which
  figure from history has returned to us in the form of a newly “ex-Nigerian”
  Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party
  Appearing on a podcast last week, Badenoch said that she no longer identifies
  as Nigerian. This was bizarre even by Badenochian standards. Her words: “I
  don’t identify with it [Nigeria] any more. Most of my life has been in the UK
  …” She went further: “I’m Nigerian through ancestry, by birth, despite not
  being born there because of my parents … but by identity, I’m not really.” The
  podcast presenter, the former Tory MP and all-round lovely chap Gyles
  Brandreth, deserves an award for not falling into a laughter-induced coma as
  Olukemi Olufunto desperately struggled with a self-imposed form of the late
  Norman Tebbit’s “whose side are you on anyway” cultural loyalty test. Badenoch
  isn’t a runaway favourite. Just today Liz Truss, momentarily the Tory leader,
  now the stuff of actual stand-up comedy, accused her of “repeating spurious
  narratives” about the economy. That’s a bit cats in a true blue sack: but,
  listening to the leader of the opposition, now and previously, on matters of
  race and identity, I do find her confused and confusing. For someone keen to
  shed the weight of Nigerian origins, she appears to make much of them, if
  negatively. Nigerians in the diaspora tend to obsess about three topics:
  making money, Premier League football and Nigeria. Of this cohort, Badenoch
  sounds like a recent “Japa” (a person who migrated from Nigeria usually to the
  west) who just cannot stop talking about “back home”. A few months ago, the
  theme was ethnic enmity and corruption. Last month, doing the anti-immigration
  two-step on Fareed Zakaria’s CNN show, she said her daughters were unable to
  attain Nigerian citizenship because “I am a woman”. That was sad: cue violins.
  But it’s also nonsense. The Nigerian constitution confers citizenship on to
  her children by dint of the fact that one of their parents or grandparents is
  Nigerian – which is actually more liberal and inclusive than the British
  approach to citizenship. It is infuriating that Badenoch tends not to do
  interviews with people with knowledge of Nigeria or even honest brokers on the
  Black experience in Britain. The result is that her more confusing
  pronouncements – such as the contention she “doesn’t like socialism” because
  of her experiences in Nigeria – go unchallenged. A clued-up interviewer might
  say: “I put it to you that Nigeria is one of the most brutally capitalist
  nations on Earth, one without any real welfare state. You actually grew up in
  a recently liberated former British colony that was struggling under the
  weight of history and IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes – the
  mother of all austerity regimes.” That’s why her response to even the prospect
  of an appropriate interviewer is to run a one-minute mile. On one level it’s
  all comedic, but it also seems sadly revealing. The colonial mindset that
  everything western is unquestionably superior is one that too many Nigerians
  have yet to discard: especially Nigeria’s political elite. These interviews
  also reveal something significant about Britain and the Conservative party.
  She says these things in public, knowing there is a market for them. In
  Brandreth’s podcast, Badenoch says she has not experienced racial prejudice in
  the UK “in any meaningful form”, adding, “People didn’t treat me differently,
  and it’s why I’m so quick to defend the UK whenever there are accusations of
  racism.” That’s great for her – go Kemi. But it hardly describes the general
  Black experience – as we might hope someone with such a profile would do – or
  anything backed up by data. So she is spouting derogatory nonsense about her
  country of cultural origin and misleads about the country she calls home. If
  there is value to her public utterances, it is hard to discern what that is.
  These are trying times, but those of us who feel proudly able to carry
  multiple identities – enriched by that privilege and truth – will have to go
  on without Kemi. Nigerians will have to love her, accepting that love is
  unrequited. Black Britons will seek to know and understand her, even if she
  shows no obvious yen to know or understand them. And people can change: for
  the day will come when tickling rightwing tummies no longer works, and VIP
  Kemi returns to mundane Earth as Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch. We’ll see
  what she says then. Nels Abbey is an author, broadcaster and the founder of
