  Saturday 8am (all times BST) Matchday live Football Rob Smyth and Emillia
  Hawkins have all the buildup to the Premier League’s third Saturday of the
  season with six top-flight matches. They’ll spin through the headlines from
  overnight, including Friday night’s Championship clash between Leicester and
  Birmingham, as well as flagging the day’s big Football League and Scottish
  Premiership action, with team news and all the latest breaking transfer
  stories before the summer window closes on Monday. Jacob Steinberg will also
  be doing a Q&amp;A from Stamford Bridge before Chelsea v Fulham. 12.30pm
  Chelsea v Fulham live Premier League Fulham won this fixture 2-1 last season,
  ending a 21-game winless streak away to Chelsea in all competitions. Two 1-1
  draws and a Carabao Cup win in midweek signal a fair start to this term for
  Marco Silva’s side, despite a glaring lack of new faces arriving in the
  summer, though Raúl Jiménez has impressed. That said, they’ve never won
  consecutive visits to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea, meanwhile, failed to score in
  their opening game then thumped West Ham 5-1 at the London Stadium. Their
  outstanding performer has been João Pedro, with four goals in four starts for
  the Blues. Rob Smyth steers our live blog, while Jacob Steinberg reports from
  the west London derby. 2pm Dutch Grand Prix qualifying Formula One Formula One
  kicks back into action after its summer shutdown, with Lando Norris resuming
  his title tussle with McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri. The Briton trails the
  Australian by nine points with 10 races remaining but won last time out in
  Hungary, coming out on top in the strategy battle before fending off Piastri’s
  late lunge to take his fifth win of the season – and his third in the last
  four races. Saturday’s qualifying, then, comes at a critical point in the
  season, with Dominic Booth covering the session lap by rapid lap. Our F1
  reporter Giles Richards is trackside at Zandvoort. 3pm Man Utd v Burnley and
  Wolves v Everton live Premier League Nothing but victory will do against
  promoted Burnley otherwise Manchester United will head into the first
  international break of the season in turmoil. Ruben Amorim’s future is up for
  debate during that period, with a trip to rivals Manchester City, a home game
  against Chelsea and trip to the unhappy hunting ground of Brentford coming up
  in September. Your clockwatch host Emillia Hawkins will also be monitoring the
  match at Molineux as Wolves take on Everton, with the hosts having lost just
  two of their 11 Premier League home games against their opponents. Will Unwin
  reports from Old Trafford and John Brewin at Wolves. 4.30pm US Open live
  Tennis Katy Murrells picks up the action from NYC. World No 1 Jannik Sinner is
  back on court, and faces the Canadian Denis Shapovalov. The Italian is in
  startling form, having lost just four games in his first-round win over Vit
  Kopriva. The defending champion then swept past Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2, 6-2
  in just over two hours. Tumaini Carayol will be reporting from Flushing
  Meadows on the pick of the action. 5pm England v Samoa live Women’s Rugby
  World Cup Marlie Packer will lead a second-string England into their second
  World Cup match after head coach John Mitchell made extensive changes to the
  lineup that thrashed the USA. There are only two survivors from the starting
  XV that amassed 11 tries in Sunderland, with Packer captain in her first
  appearance since serving a one-match ban for being sent off for a dangerous
  clear-out against Spain earlier this month. Zoe Aldcroft, England’s captain
  for the tournament, is stood down as part of squad rotation for the pool
  stage, which ends against Australia on 6 September. Daniel Gallan is our live
  blog host, with Sarah Rendell and Andy Bull providing reports and analysis
  from Franklin’s Gardens. Later, Daniel returns as the USA take on Australia
  from 7.30pm, with Luke McLaughlin reporting from York. 5.30pm Leeds v
  Newcastle live Premier League Newcastle arrive at Elland Road with Alexander
  Isak’s future at the club dominating Eddie Howe’s agenda. Nick Woltemade’s
  impending arrival from Stuttgart in a club record £70m move could open the
  door to the Swede’s departure with the clock ticking down on the transfer
  window’s closure on Monday. Leeds won 1-0 against Everton at Elland Road last
  time out, but Tuesday’s embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Sheffield Wednesday
  shows the task still facing their manager Daniel Farke. New signing Noah
  Okafor is a doubt with a groin problem, though Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who made
  his debut on Tuesday, is expected to face the Magpies. Keeping up with action
  is Scott Murray, with Ross Heppenstall reporting from Leeds. Sunday 8am
  Matchday live Football John Brewin and Dominic Booth trawl through the
  controversies and updates from Saturday’s games before our unmissable live
  football countdown blog looks forward to a Sunday packed with compelling
  Premier League action. While there will be live blogs for the Old Firm derby,
  Brighton v Manchester City and the day’s big game – Liverpool v Arsenal –
  there’s plenty of interest elsewhere with two troubled clubs – Nottingham
  Forest and West Ham – facing off. You have to say it’s a bleak picture for the
  winless Hammers, who haven’t scored in any of their last four Premier League
  visits to the City Ground. The last Hammers player to score there was Michael
  Hughes way back in September 1996. Let’s not forget the evening fixture
  between Aston Villa and Crystal Palace. The hosts are unbeaten in their last
  19 home Premier League matches but Palace won 4-1 in their last meeting with
  Villa in February. 12pm Rangers v Celtic live Scottish Premiership Scotland’s
  big two have certainly been through the mill of late, brought crashing to
  earth with hapless Champions League qualifying exits. Glaringly, the mood at
  Ibrox has soured around Russell Martin, who will be scrabbling for his
  managerial future against Celtic. Defeat in Sunday’s Old Firm game would leave
  Rangers nine points behind their city rivals after four games. The 6-0
  drubbing by Club Brugge means the former Southampton manager has won just
  three of his first 10 matches in charge. Daniel Harris helms our live blog,
  while Ewan Murray reports. 2pm Brighton v Man City Premier League The 2-0
  defeat by Spurs last time out will certainly have made Pep Guardiola
  determined to recover quickly from an early season setback. Amid the
  disappointment with the performance of goalkeeper James Trafford there is
  plenty of swirl around the City futures of Stefan Ortega, Manuel Akanji,
  Nathan Aké and Ilkay Gündogan as Monday’s transfer deadline day crashes into
  view. Meanwhile, Brighton’s Fabian Hürzeler is still buzzing from the 6-0
  Carabao Cup win at Oxford: “It’s so important as it gives you energy. You can
  feel it in the building today,” he says. The £20m Greek teenager Stefanos
  Tzimas, who scored twice on his senior debut, may start. Tim de Lisle hosts
  our live blog, with Jonathan Wilson reporting from the Amex. 2pm Dutch Grand
  Prix live Formula One A sea of orange will greet Max Verstappen on his return
  to the Dutch circuit of Zandvoort, despite a fluctuating, troubled campaign
  for the Red Bull driver. The world champion has not been at his dominant best
  this season but still expects fervid local support for Sunday’s race. “It
  brings a smile on my face, seeing that amount of orange is very special,” he
  says. “It’s not only about the driving, there is quite a bit of a party going
  on across these three days – unfortunately not for me. But [the fans] seem to
  have a great time.” Also hoping for uplift is Lewis Hamilton. The seven-time
  world champion was downbeat after a tough weekend in Hungary last time out,
  describing himself as “absolutely useless”. The 40-year-old, who is still
  awaiting a first podium with Ferrari, has arrived in the Netherlands with a
  renewed motivation and says he wants to approach the final 10 races of the
  season with a fresh mindset. “We’re going to work hard, keep our heads down,
  try to change a few things in our approach and start to enjoy ourselves,”
  Hamilton says. Dominic Booth provides lap-by-lap updates, with Giles Richards
  reporting. 4.30pm Liverpool v Arsenal live Premier League Last season’s top
  two collide in the weekend’s marquee game, with the champions’ manager Arne
  Slot admitting his Liverpool side have to improve, with their recent set-piece
  performances a concern. “If you then look at all the quality they have and
  especially one thing that stands out in the season until now – and what stands
  out in a negative way for us is we have conceded, if I include the [Athletic]
  Bilbao game, [from] four set-pieces,” says the Reds’ manager. “Of course, as
  we all know, that is one of their strengths – not the strength, but one of
  their strengths.” Arsenal, however, are amid an early season injury crisis,
  with Mikel Arteta unable to call on Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Ødegaard,
  Christian Norgaard, Ben White and Gabriel Jesus. One item of good news is new
  signing Viktor Gyökeres is fit and scored his first two Premier League goals
  last time out against Leeds. Your live host is Will Unwin, with our peerless
  team of David Hytner, Andy Hunter and Barney Ronay offering reports, news and
  analysis. 4.30pm US Open live Tennis Katy Murrells is back to keep the updates
  flowing on day eight of the US Open. Tumaini Carayol will be reporting from
  Flushing Meadows on the pick of Sunday’s action.
