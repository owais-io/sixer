  writing about them

  It is my birthday this week. And while that may not sound like a worthy
  subject for Pushing Buttons, bear with me. I am now 54 – and so officially in
  my mid-50s – and I still write about video games for a living. I play video
  games every day; I work in a home office where I’m surrounded by video games.
  When I’m not playing them, I’m probably thinking about them. But at times like
  this, I think: maybe should I stop someday? Is there an upper limit on how
  long someone can do games journalism? Certainly I only know of a handful of
  people my age who are still writing about games on a full-time basis. Some of
  my friends outside the industry still play games, but usually only one or two
  a year – EA Sports FC, maybe, the latest blockbusting narrative adventure,
  Nintendo with the kids. If you’re not careful, life has a way of shepherding
  you away from your interests. I now find it difficult to keep up with some
  areas of the industry. The world of esports feels utterly alien – the
  multitude of leagues and competitions, the emerging superstars, the
  controversies. Following it all is a full-time job, one that is more suited to
  a sports writer. I’m also way behind on influencers and content creators – I
  don’t watch Kai Cenat, LazarBeam or QuarterJade, though I have a vague sense
  of who they are and how important they have become as arbiters of taste. When
  I go on press trips to see new games, I’m old enough to be a parent to most of
  the young writers and creators I meet. The thing is, I’m still obsessed with
  how games work and how they’re made. I belong to a generation that assumed
  games would always be for kids, but they’re patently not now. From the
  nostalgic adventure Lost Records: Bloom and Rage, which deals with middle-aged
  regret to the God of War series with its study of parenthood and legacy (and
  part of the “dadification of games” trend, which started when a certain
  generation of developers started to have kids), video games now tell stories
  that span a whole lifetime. So we need journalists of all ages to write about
  them. Consider film journalism. Roger Ebert wrote about film for the Chicago
  Sun-Times until his death in 2013; the Observer’s late, great film critic
  Philip French officially retired at 80 but kept writing about cinema until he
  died two years later. They never stop watching and enjoying movies, so why
  should they have stopped writing about them? I now have a longer history in
  games playing than a huge majority of the younger writers I read, commission
  and admire. I played Pac-Man when it first arrived; I owned a Commodore 64 and
  a Mega Drive; I reviewed a game on the Virtual Boy, for god’s sake. At the
  risk of this becoming a self-indulgent take on Roy Batty’s closing speech,
  I’ve seen things you people would believe, but perhaps didn’t actually
  witness. If history has taught us anything, it’s that first-hand experience is
  vital in understanding sociocultural impact. And while, today, anyone can load
  up Space Invaders on an emulator, the experience of seeing that game in 1978,
  in its context of disco, the early home computing revolution and Star Wars
  mania, has a kind of emotional patina that is hard to conjure in 2025. I often
  say how vitally important it is to keep playing – whether you’re playing video
  games, chess, football or historical battle re-enactments. It’s also important
  to keep asking questions about the world and the things we enjoy. And when
  you’ve been doing that long enough, you get to know how the stories often end.
  Currently, we’re worried about censorship in games, thanks to the machinations
  of payment processing companies. But I’ve been here before – I’ve been through
  Mary Whitehouse and Jack Thompson and a 100 tabloid moral panics. It’s
  reassuring to know that this too shall pass. You are always an active part of
  what you enjoy – the books you read, the teams you support, the gigs you go
  to. Life is a network of experiences between which we get to draw our own
  connections and conclusions, and create our own maps of the vast, dizzying
  cultural landscape we live in. This is as true at the age of 95 as it was at
  16, or in my case, at age 54. In short, you’re stuck with me. The game, I
  hope, is far from over. What to play As I’m in a nostalgic mood, I would like
  to recommend the retro collection Gradius Origins from Konami and developer
  M2, the undisputed expert in updating classic titles to modern machines.
  Origins gathers all six instalments in the revered arcade shoot-’em-up series,
  including Gradius 1-3 and the spin-off Salamander titles, including Japanese,
  North American and often prototype versions, and it adds an impressive new
  addition, Salamander 3. These are superlative side-scrollers with cool
  spacecraft, excellent weapon power-up systems and surreal biomechanical
  landscapes and bosses. Enemy attack patterns are intense yet beautifully
  choreographed, the action precise and unforgiving (although you do get to save
  your progress this time round, unlike the originals). Alongside the games,
  there are tantalising digital galleries including arcade flyers, concept art
  and guides to all the enemy ships. It’s a wonderful blast down memory lane.
  Available on: PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Estimated playtime: 20 hours-plus What to
  read I enjoyed this article by Maddy Myers about Death Stranding 2’s
  fourth-wall shattering moments. I’ve put 100 hours into Hideo Kojima’s weird
  masterpiece, and his nods to the artificiality of the world have been
  refreshing reminders about the hyperreal nature of modern games and the role
  players have in completing the illusion. Variety has a wide-ranging interview
  with Electronic Arts Entertainment’s president, Laura Miele. It seems there
  are plans for an Apex Legends movie, to go alongside the publisher’s Sims film
  that is in the works. Personally, I’d rather see a Mirror’s Edge or Titanfall
  movie, or even better: a new Mirror’s Edge or Titanfall game. Over the
  weekend, the video game retail site GOG offered 13 mature-rated games for
  free, including Postal 2 and House Party – and one-million players took them
  up on the offer. Its intention was to raise awareness of censorship in gaming,
  after the controversy regarding payment processing terms and NSFW titles.
  Eurogamer has more. What to click Time Flies – existential flight game with a
  bittersweet buzz | ★★★★☆ All-star lineup: Aphelion, a game made in
  collaboration with the European Space Agency The Trolley Solution: the
  internet’s most memed moral dilemma becomes a video game Go-to entertainment:
  why gaming was made for the toilet Punch bags, penny pushers and Hillbilly
  shootouts: the 10 best classic seaside arcade machines Question Block Here’s
  one from Kohigh Mathy on Bluesky: “Why do some genres, like music, real-time
  tactics and point and click adventures, seem to vanish for years, only to
  resurface? Is it market fatigue, tech shifts, or something else?” There are a
  number of reasons, I think. In a similar way to how certain movie genres
  continually disappear and return, partly it’s do with generational cycles of
  influence. A game developer who loved a genre as a child may, as an adult,
  seek to re-create it – part of the reason we’re seeing so many low-poly
  survival horror games now is that the creators grew up playing Resident Evil
  on the original PlayStation. There’s also a cultural, even sociopolitical
  element – developers are inspired by the world around them and it could be
  that some contemporary events or themes are best realised by specific game
  genres. So we may see a sudden boost in military real-time strategy games
  during periods of global instability and conflict. I think there are technical
  influences, too. When a new console or graphics card is released, there is a
  rush to produce classic genres on that platform, because veteran players who
  fondly recall those game types like to see them reinvented. Then there’s the
  interplay between nostalgia and innovation in the rediscovery of old genres.
  In a market where everyone is making Souls-likes, hero shooters and
  deck-building games, there’s value in producing a new take on, say, a
  1990s-style interactive movie game, or a graphic adventure, or a
  button-bashing multi-sports sim – this way, you’re producing something a
  little different while still harking back to much-loved archetypes. It’s a
  win-win situation. If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything
  else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.
