  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 7th (NB: this is not necessarily Suzanne
  Wrack’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 1st in the Championship Prospects To assess the prospects of a team
  you would usually think about prior performances, new signings, prior
  consistency, ambition and so many more variables. Doing so for the WSL newbies
  London City Lionesses is nigh-on impossible because they have undergone a
  complete squad overhaul. A staggering 15 players have come in (with two then
  going out on loan) and 11 have exited. Change isn’t limited to the pitch
  either, with the training ground in flux, buildings coming down and going up
  as the club try to turn Cobdown Park in Aylesford into an environment fit for
  elite professionals. There isn’t a precedent set by another promoted club that
  would give us an indication of the side’s potential because no promoted team
  have had the level of investment that London City had pumped in this summer.
  They are an anomaly, powered by the investment of their billionaire owner,
  Michele Kang. The ambition is high. As Kang said to Sky Sports at the end of
  last season: “We have been building a team to be at a minimum, on day one,
  mid-tier WSL.” The five-time Champions League winning midfielder Saki Kumagai,
  who joined Kang’s project in January, echoed that sentiment last week. “For
  us, it’s not about staying in the WSL, though of course we want to, but it’s
  about pushing towards that top three or four so the following season we can
  start pushing for Champions League qualification,” she said. The task will be
  stitching together a patchwork quilt of players. London City have signed some
  big names, in Daniëlle van de Donk, Nikita Parris, Katie Zelem and others, who
  join players such as Kumagai and the Swedish forward Kosovare Asllani, but
  these are arguably players closer to the end of their careers than the start.
  Marrying that experience with the young talents who have joined into a team
  capable of competing in the league consistently is a big ask, but the quality
  is there. The manager Jocelyn Prêcheur was poached by Kang from Paris
  Saint-Germain in 2024. He had taken the reins there after his father, Gérard
  Prêcheur, departed, stepping up from being an assistant coach. That was the
  second time he had worked with his father, having assisted him at Jiangsu
  Suning in the Chinese Super League. He won his first and only trophy with PSG
  in 2024, the Coupe de France, and helped guide London City to the Championship
  (now WSL2) title in his first season. The test gets harder in the WSL but
  having gelled a side capable of helping the club achieve their objective of
  reaching the WSL, the 43-year-old has shown he can get new players working
  together. Off-field picture The purchase and redevelopment of their 28-acre
  training facility is symbolic of Kang’s commitment towards her growing women’s
  football empire – with Washington Spirit and Lyon also owned by the
  billionaire. Kang has made clear she is not expecting short-term returns on
  these investments, though she sees the potential for profit in the long term
  given the trajectory of the women’s game. London City’s promotion on the final
  day of the season was justification for the investment. A mid-table finish
  this season would do that further. Star signing Who do you choose out of the
  15 incoming players? How about one with experience and one rising in Van de
  Donk and Jana Fernández respectively. The Dutch midfielder Van de Donk returns
  to London, where she won the FA Cup, League Cup and WSL title with Arsenal,
  after four years and eight trophies, including a Champions League with Lyon.
  Fernández represents the desire to build a squad with a future, the
  23-year-old defender recruited from Barcelona, where she was part of a squad
  that won three Champions Leagues. Stepping up Isobel Goodwin returns to the
  WSL after leaving Aston Villa for Coventry United in January 2023 having made
  three top-flight appearances. After six months with Coventry she joined
  Sheffield United and her 15 goals in 19 games for the Blades caught the eye of
  promotion-hungry London City. Last season she scored 16 times in 18 games as
  London City battled their way to the title. How will she fare on her return to
  the WSL and with star-studded signings providing for her? It’s an exciting
  prospect. It was a good summer for … With London City spending big, selling
  clubs have probably had the best summer. A host of their new squad competed at
  the 2025 Euros this summer, though with England emerging victorious none will
  have walked away particularly happy. The 20-year-old Freya Godfrey made her
  loan move permanent this summer, having spent time with Ipswich and Charlton
  on loan from Arsenal before spending last season with London City. The young
  midfielder scored in a 3-1 friendly defeat by Lyon in August. Main initiative
  to attract more fans Attracting fans is one of London City’s biggest
  challenges. As an independent club, unconnected to a men’s team, they have no
  existing fanbase to pull from, unless some Millwall Lionesses fans switched
  across when the women’s team broke away from the club in 2019. Playing at
  Princes Park in Dartford hasn’t helped. A move to Bromley’s Hayes Lane has
  come with attempts to build a local fanbase, and investment is being made in
  the matchday experience. The club have also connected with about 40 local
  girls’ teams across London, who have become sister clubs.
