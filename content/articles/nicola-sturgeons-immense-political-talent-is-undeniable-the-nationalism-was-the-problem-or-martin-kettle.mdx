  Nicola Sturgeon was – and still is – important, talented, personable and, to
  many, inspirational. She was also extremely lucky and often wrong, sometimes
  seriously so. There are examples of all these qualities in her newly published
  memoir, Frankly. Sturgeosceptics should concede at once that it contains much
  that is fascinating, especially about her relations with her charismatic
  mentor turned vengeful enemy Alex Salmond. Starry-eyed Sturgies should equally
  admit she made several deep and lasting errors that have left behind a divided
  nationalist party and movement. The book is more open and touching about
  private issues than most political memoirs, although Sturgeon deploys these
  qualities selectively. Many of the intimate reflections are about being a
  woman in politics. Other memoirs by female politicians – including those of
  Margaret Thatcher, Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel – leave such subjects
  alone. Sturgeon does not. She writes about her relationships, her miscarriage,
  her sexuality and her menopause. Yet to me, the single most affecting sentence
  in the book comes near the end, when she describes her resignation in 2023.
  “In short,” she writes, in words that should be pondered by male and female
  rulers alike, “I was exhausted.” After Sturgeon’s years of power, who would
  not have been? From the moment she joined the Scottish National party as a
  teenager, Sturgeon built a career at the most demanding and, for nationalists,
  the headiest time in modern Scottish history. She was a parliamentarian, a
  minister, deputy leader and then leader of her party, and finally Scotland’s
  first minister from 2014 to 2023. Roy Jenkins wrote long ago that eight years
  at the top is as much as anyone should be permitted in the full-on world that
  is modern politics, and Sturgeon’s career proves him right. You can quibble,
  as some people have, about whether being Scotland’s first minister is really
  as important and demanding as being a US president or a UK prime minister.
  Clearly it is not. However, after what the self-confessed workaholic Sturgeon
  had already crammed in, she was surely right to get out two years ago and
  prepare for the rest of her life. She is still only 55, and she is entitled to
  use this book as a pivot from the old to the new, whatever that may be. Just
  don’t idealise her, that’s all. The most important thing about Sturgeon’s
  political career is not whether she was relatable, good on television or
  better than the men. Pretty obviously, she was all three. It is whether she
  was right to be a nationalist. In my book, she was wrong. From her teenage
  years, Sturgeon’s overriding political goal has been to break up the United
  Kingdom. It still is. Many of her admirers, especially in England, ignore this
  fact. But it cannot be ignored, in part because everything else that she did
  in politics was always ultimately subordinate to it, and in part because, even
  now, her cause may yet win in the years ahead if British parties and
  governments allow it to happen. Sturgeon’s great political talent was her
  ability to ride the waves of change. Talent was part of that. But good luck
  also played a huge role. The first major example of this came in 2004, when
  she over-ambitiously threw her hat into the ring to become SNP leader in a
  contest most observers thought she would lose. Who knows where the story would
  have ended if she had fought on? Over a private dinner in Linlithgow, however,
  Salmond told Sturgeon that he was planning to enter the contest, and proposed
  a pact in which she would run as deputy and eventually succeed him. Labour was
  already haemorrhaging votes as a result of the Iraq war. In 2007 the duo took
  the SNP to power at Holyrood. Sturgeon quickly became the most popular
  politician in Scotland. In 2011, the SNP won an unprecedented overall
  majority. Her second big stroke of luck, nevertheless, was the defeat of the
  2014 independence referendum. Salmond resigned in the aftermath, leaving
  Sturgeon as his unchallengeable successor. SNP membership soared. What could
  have been a hospital pass was instead a coronation. A few months later, it got
  even better. At the 2015 general election, the SNP captured all but three of
  Scotland’s Westminster seats. Then came Brexit, opposed by the majority of
  voters in Scotland. This presented the nationalists with a perfect platform to
  claim that the union was denying Scotland its will. While the Tories became
  obsessed with Brexit, and Labour turned in on itself, Sturgeon was able to
  pitch Scotland as a nation that marched to a different and more progressive
  drum, and to follow the pro-European path. But the SNP did not have things all
  its own way. True, the party remained dominant. Electorally speaking, Sturgeon
  could have titled her book Undefeated. True also, Sturgeon managed to keep the
  prospect of a second referendum simmering without boiling over. But in other
  respects the Scottish political and economic landscape was getting far tougher
  for the SNP. There were rows about Lockerbie, on which Sturgeon’s book is
  informative, and about Hebridean ferry contracts and overruns and Scotland’s
  drug problems – topics on which she has next to nothing to say. Sturgeon’s
  unequivocal pledge in 2016 to eliminate the educational attainment gap between
  children from rich and poor neighbourhoods in the next decade is skated over
  too. Her account of the court case against Salmond is nothing if not bitter.
  Her gender recognition reforms were dogmatic and divisive. Her legacy in many
  respects is division, and perhaps fiscal unsustainability. The reminder in
  Wednesday’s Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report that Scotland’s
  public spending deficit has widened even further than in the UK as a whole is
  a timely counterpoint to Sturgeon’s version of history. But the greatest gift
  that the gods ever presented to Sturgeon and the SNP came in 2019: Boris
  Johnson’s accession to the UK prime ministership. Sturgeon did not have to
  make an argument against Johnson. She could merely let people observe the
  contrast between his sloppiness and her precision, and let them judge for
  themselves. It would have been the same with Liz Truss, if she had lasted.
  Sturgeon used every lever to imply that Scotland was handling the pandemic
  better than the wider UK. To many in Scotland and in England, the contrast
  marked Sturgeon’s apotheosis. In England, some yearned to have Sturgeon in
  charge south of the border too, and had done so during the Cameron and May
  years as well. Yet this was to fundamentally misread Sturgeon. It was a
  misreading that she was smart enough to encourage. Hers is an interesting
  account. But it is not the full story. She was not seeking to be the negation
  of Johnson or Truss. Her aim was to be the negation of the union. It is on
  this that she should be judged, by nationalists and anti-nationalists alike.
  By that yardstick her career has – frankly – been a failure. So far, at least.
