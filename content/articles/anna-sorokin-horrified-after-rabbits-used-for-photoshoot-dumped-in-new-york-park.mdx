  After years of prison and conniving her way into luxury, Anna Sorokin has New
  York talking about her again. This time, it is not posing as a German heiress
  or being jailed for four years, instead the convicted fraudster has been left
  “disturbed” and “horrified” after three rabbits used in her photoshoot were
  found dumped in a nearby park. Sorokin, who also went by the name Anna Delvey
  and is the subject of Netflix’s Inventing Anna, shot to infamy after a
  high-profile court case. The fraudster, who masqueraded as an heiress,
  swindled the wealthy in Manhattan with an invented trust fund. But this latest
  saga involves a photograph on her Instagram account, in which she is pictured
  outside a Tribeca subway station with a black ankle monitor – stipulated under
  the terms of her 2022 prison release – and holding two leashed rabbits. Days
  after posing for the photographs, social media users were quick to link the
  abandoned bunnies with Sorokin after the animals were spotted in Prospect Park
  in Brooklyn. “I felt ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with it,”
  Sorokin said of the affair. The 34-year-old said she was not responsible for
  the rabbits and was “horrified” to learn they had been dumped. The first
  bunny, a one-and-a-half-year-old Harlequin lop, was found in the bushes by
  Terry Chao near a cardboard box used as part of Sorokin’s photoshoot last
  week. On Thursday, another rabbit was found near the same cardboard box,
  followed by a third on Sunday, near a black carrier bag, she told the New York
  Times. The man who photographed Sorokin, Jasper Egan Soloff, told the
  newspaper through a lawyer that it was not his shoot and claimed to have no
  knowledge of how the animals were obtained or handled. Another person involved
  in the shoot appears to have apologised and taken responsibility in a
  since-deleted Instagram post. “When I realised the rabbits were being
  surrendered to me I panicked. At 19, with no experience caring for animals, no
  pet-friendly housing, and no knowledge of available resources, I felt
  overwhelmed and made the worst possible choice,” he reportedly wrote.
  “Believing, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area, I
  released them there, thinking that was my best option.” He added that they
  were being fostered by someone in New York, while Sorokin said she offered to
  help rehome the rabbits when she learned they had been abandoned. People on
  social media have accused Sorokin of animal cruelty. Many commenters decried
  her use of the animals as props, and warned against photographing bunnies on
  leashes on their backs, a position known as trancing that can be harmful to
  the animals. “I do not eat meat, and I had no involvement in the acquisition,
  transport, or return of these animals. I would never condone these actions,”
  Sorokin told the website Page Six. After being convicted in 2019 on multiple
  counts of larceny and theft, she was released after nearly four years in jail
  and a further 18 months in immigration detention for overstaying her visa, and
  was told to refrain from posting on social media.
