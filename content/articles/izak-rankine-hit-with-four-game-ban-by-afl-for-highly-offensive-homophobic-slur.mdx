  The AFL says Izak Rankine is paying a “significant price” for using a
  homophobic slur during the weekend’s game against Collingwood, after the
  Adelaide star’s season was potentially ended by a four-match ban. “Compelling
  medical submissions” were considered in reaching the verdict, which fell short
  of a possible five games and keeps the door open for Rankine to feature again
  this season, but the AFL CEO Andrew Dillon would not elaborate on what those
  medical considerations were. After days of deliberation – due to the Crows
  being granted more time to plead their case for a leaner suspension – the
  league finally handed down its sanction on Thursday afternoon, seriously
  denting the club’s premiership hopes. Rankine will miss the final round of the
  home-and-away season – Saturday’s clash against North Melbourne – and the next
  three games, but he could still return for the grand final, should the Crows
  lose a final en route to the flag decider. Dillon said the language used by
  Rankine was “offensive, hurtful and highly inappropriate”. “Importantly this
  incident was called out by the players and ultimately acknowledged by Izak as
  wrong. Inclusion and respect our key priorities for the AFL, central to who we
  are is a game and organisation,” he said. “Players get taunted, players get
  provoked. When the line is crossed, there must be accountability and in this
  instance Izak is paying a significant price. Let me be very clear, this
  behaviour is not acceptable.” The AFL’s integrity unit found that Rankine used
  a “highly offensive homophobic slur” during the fourth quarter of the
  weekend’s game and while he did not self report, he later rang the Collingwood
  player to apologise and subsequently cooperated with investigation. “I regret
  using the word and I am very sorry for doing so, and that type of language has
  no place in football or the community,” Rankine said. “It was a mistake and I
  have apologised to the Collingwood player, and what happened does not reflect
  my values or those of the club. I’m committed to educating myself and being
  better.” The ban mirrors one of two incidences earlier this season, when a
  four-match suspension was given to West Coast’s Jack Graham, but it was not as
  severe as the five games handed to Sydney player Riak Andrew. Three further
  bans ranging from three to six games were dished out to AFL and VFL players
  last year for similar offences. Dillon refuted suggestions the shorter ban was
  down to a finals games being given more weight. “A game is a game and that is
  what we took into account,” he said. “We look at the specific instances and in
  this one there were submissions made, including compelling submissions, to
  take into account when we arrived at the decision.” The AFL has attempted to
  underline its zero-tolerance policy on the use of such language over the past
  18 months, but dragged its heels on coming to a verdict on Rankine after the
  club requested more time to put forward a defence in a bid to secure a more
  lenient ban and keep alive the player’s hopes of playing finals for the first
  time in his career. A five-game suspension would certainly have ended
  Rankine’s season. “Izak has said he knew it was not acceptable,” the AFL’s
  general counsel Stephen Meade said in a statement. “Adelaide have said they
  know it is not acceptable. In an AFL environment, this behaviour is not
  acceptable. Homophobia has no place in football. “One incident of this nature
  is too many and the fact there have been multiple this year shows we still
  have more work to do and we are committed to that.” Adelaide are guaranteed to
  finish in the top two after Saturday night’s narrow win over Collingwood, but
  celebrations were tempered after the integrity unit was called in on Sunday to
  investigate reports a homophobic slur was used by a Crows player. The absence
  of Rankine in September will hurt the Crows, given the goalsneak is a proven
  big-game performer and has been a match-winner during the team’s rise from a
  15-placed finish 12 months ago to genuine premiership contention this year.
  The 25-year-old has averaged 20.5 disposals and booted 31 goals as the Crows
  locked in their return to finals for the first time since 2017 and seek to
  break a 27-year premiership drought.
