  ‘I was bawling my eyes out’: Sheridan Smith on drink, death and the hardest
  role of her career

  A community hall in north-east England has been hired for the afternoon to
  film a scene for one of the standout TV dramas of this year. However, it is
  off screen – in the cramped kitchen of the building near Hartlepool – that I
  am seeing one of the most extraordinary and moving tableaux that can have
  happened on a TV shoot. Standing before a monitor, Ann Ming, a retired
  surgical nurse, calmly observes Sheridan Smith pretending to be her with the
  uncanny accuracy of appearance and speech that is the actor’s speciality. The
  shot cuts to a young woman. At this point, the production team tenses: this
  character is Julie Hogg, Ming’s daughter, who was murdered, aged 22, in 1989.
  How might someone in their 70s deal with seeing a double of herself and her
  lost child? “She looks like her,” says the bereaved mother, matter-of-factly.
  Such grace in bizarre circumstances will not surprise anyone who watches the
  ITV four-parter I Fought the Law. It shows Ming dealing first with what police
  believe to be Julie’s disappearance; then, after 80 days, the discovery of her
  body in the bathroom of a house forensic cops claimed to have carefully
  searched for five days. This led to the trial for murder of Billy Dunlop, who
  was acquitted when two juries could not reach verdicts. When the killer later
  confessed, he could not be tried again under the 800-year-old “double
  jeopardy” rule against being tried twice for the same crime. The main focus of
  the series is Ming’s campaign to overturn that rule. She did so in 2006 –
  after 17 years. “I didn’t slag off police or judges or the government,” says
  Ming from an on-set trailer labelled “Real Ann”. “I just took it step by step,
  writing letters. I slept badly because of flashbacks and nightmares and so on.
  So my husband Charlie would find me in the middle of the night writing to
  another politician. I thought: ‘I’ve got the biggest mouth. I’m going to carry
  on.’” Did Ming find that the state relied on her eventually giving up? Much
  like another case of individuals fighting officialdom that was dramatised by
  ITV in Mr Bates vs the Post Office? “Yes.” So was it stubbornness that kept
  her going? “No. I think it’s the injustice of it. When I look back, in the
  70s, my mam had an argument with the council over her house and I wrote a
  letter to the secretary of state! And got a reply. So it must always have been
  in there somewhere. That was my first project.” Her latest is to prevent
  “him”, Dunlop – like many relatives of murder victims, she refuses to speak
  the killer’s name – being released on parole or transferred to an open prison:
  “I know he’ll probably get out eventually and then I’ll have to deal with
  that. Hopefully it won’t be in my lifetime.” The series is adapted from Ming’s
  book, For the Love of Julie: “People said for years: ‘Why don’t you write a
  book?’ and I’d say: ‘It hasn’t got an ending.’ Once he was convicted, I was
  able to write it and it was cathartic. A ghost writer did the book for me
  [based on interviews] and I remember getting to the end of the transcript and
  thinking: ‘Wow, you got through all that and came out the other end.’” The
  “Real Ann” has a trailer because she is not only the subject of the story but,
  today, an actor. The scene at the community hall features a line-dancing
  class, Ming’s distracting pastime, and she cameos as one of the dancers: “I
  never did it before Julie. And then a friend of mine said: ‘Come on, you need
  to get out,’ so I started it. When Charlie got Parkinson’s, I couldn’t go for
  six years. For me it’s two and a half hours when you can’t concentrate on
  anything except the steps. So I now go five times a week. I wish Julie could
  have gone because she loved dancing.” During pre-production, she met Smith
  several times. Real people who have been portrayed on screen have told me they
  felt the actor studying them to steal gestures and inflections. Did Ming feel
  Smith doing that? “No! Was she doing that? I gelled to her straight away. I’d
  seen everything she’d done except for one, which they gave me. That was where
  Alison Steadman was her mother and she had to care for her after she’d had a
  stroke [Care, BBC One, 2018]. I had to do that for my husband and watching her
  was like watching me!” An audience enthralled by Ann’s agony at not being able
  to bring her daughter’s killer to justice despite his admission of guilt may
  wonder why the rule was held sacrosanct for eight centuries. “It’s a good
  question,” says screenwriter Jamie Crichton. “I spent a lot of time trying to
  find the most concise explanation of why ‘double jeopardy’ was a good idea.
  The best anyone offered was that it encouraged police to build the best case
  possible. If they thought they could keep coming back, they might be sloppy.
  They still have it in America, Australia, Canada and many other countries.”
  Having changed the law in the UK, Ming is looking beyond: “This programme –
  what I’d love is to send a copy to Donald Trump and say: ‘Please be brave –
  change the double jeopardy law all over America. Why are they frightened?
  People say it would mean everyone getting a retrial. But there are so many
  safeguards in the English law. It has to be ‘new and compelling’ evidence.
  When I was campaigning, someone at the Law Commission said it would only ever
  apply once in a blue moon. I said: ‘What if that blue moon was your son or
  your daughter?’” Usually, actors give interviews on set visits when they are
  not needed for shooting. Smith can’t today as she is in almost every scene. So
  it is almost a year later that I speak to the actor at the launch of the
  series. She apologises for “only being able to say hello” during filming but
  she has no need to be sorry: not only was there the volume of scenes, but
  almost every moment in the four hours is emotionally fraught. The director,
  Erik Richter Strand, told her he was amazed by how easily she seemed to find
  the necessary emotion. Is it simple? “Erik thinks it was,” says Smith.
  “Because he would say: ‘Now cry!’, ‘Now scream!’ And he got so used to me
  crying so much that I think he thought it was like a tap. But actually there’s
  a struggle underneath to get it.” At drama school, aren’t actors taught to be
  “in the moment”? “Yeah. But I didn’t go to drama school. So I don’t know what
  I’m doing. I’m blagging it. Really I just try to recreate the trauma the
  character would have gone through. I could never say: ‘Give me a tear stick
  and I’ll pretend to cry.’ I have to feel it.” Ming is the latest of several
  real-life people Smith has played, following Cilla Black in Cilla; Charmian
  Biggs (wife of Great Train Robber Ronnie) in Mrs Biggs; Sarah Sak, mother of a
  murder victim in Four Lives; Julie Bushby, searching for missing schoolgirl
  Shannon Matthews in The Moorside; and cancer patient Lisa Lynch in The C Word.
  Are these biographical roles policy or just what she is offered? “Not just
  professional offers. Lisa Lynch contacted me on Twitter and asked me to play
  her. I wasn’t conscious of it happening. But I think the time I can really act
  is when it’s someone’s pain. Whether it’s my pain coming out through the
  acting I don’t know. But I find doing the make-believe stuff much harder. With
  Mrs Biggs, I’d remember the night my brother died and my mum screaming so I’d
  tap into that. Now, as a mum, I imagine what if something happened to your
  child. So I was relieved to finish the job and get home to my son. But also
  aware that Ann doesn’t get to go home to her daughter. So the least I could do
  was go through those nine weeks’ torture. Although I don’t want to sound like
  a wanky actor. It is just acting, but at the same time I find playing a real
  person gives me purpose. I love doing comedy and make-believe but there’s
  something about playing a real person’s story.” She deeply feels the
  responsibility of telling real stories: “There was a really emotionally
  charged scene where Ann tells her grandson that she has lied to him about how
  his mum died. And I didn’t realise Ann was watching – I don’t think I could
  have done it if I had known – until she walked on set and said: ‘It was like
  you’re in my body.’ And we were both bawling our eyes out. That was the
  reassurance I needed.” Their relationship, though, was not a complete love-in:
  “That day you were on set, she saw me smoking and said: ‘Get that cigarette
  out of your hand,’ and she told me I had too many tattoos.” I have been
  watching Smith’s work and interviewing her about it for two decades now and
  have often been alarmed by what these extraordinary emotional performances
  seem to take out of her. Is there a cost? “Yeah, there is. I think in the past
  I’ve used acting as therapy. I’m comfortable with this because I know you. But
  at the photocall today I was shaking. Ann couldn’t believe it. But, having
  moved up north with my little boy, suddenly coming back to London and having
  photographers shouting ‘This way, this way’, it’s overwhelming. “Obviously I
  used to drink and find my way through it that way – but now that I’ve found
  therapy, got my little boy, I’m sober, doing yoga and meditation, I’m a
  totally different person. I Fought the Law took it out of me and I’ll be
  mindful of what jobs I take in the future because I’m in the best place I’ve
  been. I have to always remember that the real-life characters have actually
  gone through this but I think a little bit of each character stays in me.”
  Last year, in the play Opening Night in London’s West End, she seemed, perhaps
  riskily, to be putting herself into the character of an actor struggling
  through a production while drunk, as had seemed to be the case with Smith in
  the musical Funny Girl in 2015. Watching a scene in which Smith’s Opening
  Night character crawls around outside the theatre, I wonder if it was sensible
  to be doing this to herself? “I know! People offer these jobs and I’m still
  like the little girl from up north who thinks she’ll never work again.” But
  you were playing a version of? “Myself! I’ve never been that drunk on stage
  but, when she’s crawling across the pavement to the theatre, it definitely
  reflected Funny Girl and having the curtain brought down on me and all that.
  Doing the part was a way of facing my fears and coming to terms with it. I
  felt that if I could do that, I could do anything.” Even so, playing Ming has
  been “the hardest job I have done” and she plans to be more wary of roles that
  are an empathy decathlon: “I was always going back and forth between drinking
  and sobriety. But this time I feel it’s for real. I am, though, going to
  choose my parts very carefully. Sobriety and my son come first, so anything
  that might knock me off kilter I would be careful of. I go home and look into
  my little boy’s face and hope that one day he’ll be proud I did these things.
  With I Fought the Law, he just said: ‘Yukky wig.’ That was his review. Minus
  five stars. He just kept looking at the photo and laughing.” Smith has just
  completed The Cage, a lighter and wholly fictional BBC robbery drama but
  admits she is “ready to do comedy”. In an era of many TV remakes and reboots,
  some will wonder about the sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps,
  in which she appeared with Ralf Little, Natalie Casey, Will Mellor and Kathryn
  Drysdale in the first decade of this century. “I’d love to do that,” says
  Smith. “Especially after seeing Gavin &amp; Stacey, where they all came back
  together. I think Two Pints was like our uni for people who didn’t do uni. It
  would be a reunion with all your pals. I’d do it again in a heartbeat if
  everyone wanted to.” I Fought the Law is on ITV1 and ITVX on 31 August.
