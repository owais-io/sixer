  Tiger Woods will chair a newly created PGA Tour committee aimed at reshaping
  golf’s competitive landscape in the US. But comments made by Brian Rolapp, the
  Tour’s newly appointed chief executive, showed that unification between the
  sport’s traditional ecosystem and the Saudi Arabian‑backed LIV circuit is as
  distant as ever. Woods, who has not competed since the 2024 Open Championship
  because of injury, was the headline name when Rolapp addressed the media in
  Atlanta on the eve of the Tour Championship. After just three weeks in office,
  the chief executive has formed a future competition committee that will also
  feature Patrick Cantlay and Adam Scott. Rolapp seems clear that the tournament
  landscape has to change. “The purpose of this committee is pretty simple,”
  Rolapp said. “We’re going to design the best professional golf competitive
  model in the world for the benefit of PGA Tour fans, players and their
  partners. It is aimed at a holistic relook of how we compete. That is
  inclusive of regular season, post-season and off-season. “We’re going to focus
  on the evolution of our competitive model and the corresponding media products
  and sponsorship elements and model of the entire sport. The goal is not
  incremental change. The goal is significant change.” Creation of a meaningful
  break between PGA Tour seasons and guarantees that the most high-profile
  players will play in top events seem logical starting points for Woods. Press
  conferences such as this once tended to focus on progress on a deal between
  the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. A framework agreement
  was signed between the parties in summer 2023 with the supposed aim of uniting
  elite golf. Progress, though, has been slow: the PGA Tour rejected various
  concession requests made by the PIF in late March, in exchange for $1.5bn of
  investment. Key figures in this sport such as Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and
  Brooks Koepka play under the LIV banner and are therefore key absentees from
  the PGA Tour. Rolapp admitted he has not held discussions with the PIF. “My
  primary focus is going to be on strengthening the Tour. Blank sheet of paper
  means blank sheet of paper. Whatever does that, I’ll pursue aggressively.
  That’s how I view it.” At the Players Championship five months ago the PGA
  Tour commissioner Jay Monahan revealed that 70% of fans surveyed wanted
  unification with LIV. Rolapp echoed that sentiment in June. Pressed on whether
  he agreed golf spectators want to see the best in the game compete against
  each other more often, Rolapp appeared to backtrack. He said: “Yeah, golf fans
  want to see the best competition possible in the sport that they love in a
  competitive model that makes sense.” Subsequently challenged on whether or not
  unification should be a priority, the chief executive seemed to rail against
  “a LIV question”. He added: “I’m going to focus on what I can control. I would
  offer to you that the best collection of golfers in the world are on the PGA
  Tour. I think there’s a bunch of metrics that demonstrate that, from rankings
  to viewership to whatever you want to pick. I’m going to lean into that and
  strengthen that. “I will also say that to the extent we can do anything that’s
  going to further strengthen the PGA Tour, we’ll do that. I’m interested in
  exploring whatever strengthens the PGA Tour.” As he seeks to complete a
  sensational season with victory at the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup,
  Scottie Scheffler dismissed parallels with the once imperious Woods. The world
  No 1 has won five times in 2025, including at two majors, to separate himself
  as the dominant figure in golf. “It’s very silly to be compared to Tiger
  Woods,” Scheffler said. “Tiger is a guy that stands alone in the game of golf
  and I think he always will. Tiger inspired a whole generation of golfers.
  You’ve grown up watching that guy do what he did week in, week out, it was
  pretty amazing to see.” Scheffler did credit Woods with a role in his
  development after being in the 15-time major winner’s company at the 2020
  Masters. “I’ve only played one round of tournament golf with Tiger Woods and
  it completely changed the way I look at how I play tournaments,” Scheffler
  said. “I can’t tell you the look on his face when we got to the 1st green. I
  look over, and we’re in 20th place, kind of playing, yada, yada, yada, and I
  look over and this guy is just locked in. I was taken aback. I was like, holy
  smokes. Then we got to the 2nd hole, and he had this chip shot and he looked
  at it like it was an up-and-down to win the tournament. I’m like: ‘This is
  incredible. I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life.’”
