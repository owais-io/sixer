  The three main contenders to win the trophy at Twickenham next month came
  through their opening group matches at the Rugby World Cup with dominant
  scorelines but far from perfect performances. England, the hosts, thrashed USA
  69-7, Canada overcame Fiji 65-7 and New Zealand beat a resolute and determined
  Spain 54-8. Have any of them emerged as clear favourites? Let’s take a look at
  each performance. The Red Roses admitted they had room for improvement with
  two particular areas letting them down: restarts and handling errors. When the
  England head coach, John Mitchell, was asked about the restarts he said:
  “There is always something to work on, this game is never finite. We will move
  that into the next preparation. It’s good that we’ve got something to work
  on.” There were many things that went right for England, with the scrum a
  particular highlight. The props Maud Muir and Hannah Botterman had standout
  games and the player of the match, Ellie Kildunne, was superb again, a touch
  off her knee in the buildup to one of England’s 11 tries displayed her growing
  skill set. So while it was a little bit of a rusty start, the Red Roses have
  the makings of a team who can grow through this tournament. It was a similar
  story for the defending champions, New Zealand, but with a key difference in
  that Spain gave them a lot of headaches. Their defence was excellent at times,
  giving the Black Ferns little space, though as soon as they were given an
  inch, they took a mile – particularly through Jorja Miller, who is one to
  watch. One of the main takeaways from New Zealand’s performance was their
  adaptability. After being blighted with injuries, they finished with 13
  players and while they did concede a try in that time, remained resolute in
  defence. There is positive news on the injuries. The back-row Kaipo
  Olsen-Baker, who missed the last tournament with injury, had to be helped off
  with an ankle problem but scans revealed no fracture. Olsen-Baker is awaiting
  further assessment on when she can return. The wing Ayesha Leti‑I’iga also
  came off with an ankle injury and the centre Amy du Plessis sustained a
  shoulder issue. Both are also being assessed but all three are travelling with
  the Black Ferns squad to Exeter for their next match against Japan. The
  injuries were not the only frustrating part of New Zealand’s day. Handling
  errors disrupted their flow and in the early stages it felt like they were
  forcing passes rather than being patient. Those errors should be easily fixed.
  A positive for the Black Ferns was their goal-kicking. The full-back Renee
  Holmes kicked seven of eight conversions and while England and Canada’s lead
  kickers Zoe Harrison and Sophie de Goede were both good from the tee, Holmes
  looked the most confident. An interesting element to Canada’s game came with
  kicking in open play. They leaned into their kicking game more than England
  and New Zealand. After a few phases if their attack was not progressing, they
  put boot to ball with a total of 24 kicks from hand. The Red Roses, meanwhile,
  made 15 kicks from hand and New Zealand 13. Canada’s handling errors were also
  an issue but did not impact the outcome, mainly thanks to their electric
  full‑back Julia Schell. Coming into the tournament she had three international
  tries and tripled that with six in just over 20 second‑half minutes. Canada’s
  head coach, Kévin Rouet, was pleased his team have improved their strength in
  depth. “I am very happy,” he said. “The idea was to have 23 players coming on
  to the pitch and playing this game and I think we achieved that. We have a
  very strong bench and they bring a lot of energy. We know if we want to win
  the World Cup we can’t make the same mistake as we did three years ago, we
  need depth and everybody involved in the project which is very important for
  us.” France may not be the main contenders for the trophy but they have a
  chance and they began with a 24-0 victory against Italy. Les Bleues did not
  produce their usual flair but they do have star scrum-half Pauline Bourdon
  Sansus to welcome back after her ban. It will be interesting to see how they
  go, with their form perhaps the most unpredictable in the tournament. England
  remain firm favourites thanks to their 28-match winning run and the fact they
  are hosts, but the main contenders look on par with each other, which can only
  make the tournament all the more exciting. This is an extract taken from our
