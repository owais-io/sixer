  The Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown and her husband, Jake Bongiovi,
  have announced they have become parents after adopting a “sweet baby girl”.
  Brown, 21, and Bongiovi, 23, said in a statement on social media that they
  were “beyond excited” to enter the next chapter of their lives. Alongside a
  sketch of a tree, the couple wrote on Instagram on Thursday: “This summer, we
  welcomed our sweet baby girl through adoption. We are beyond excited to embark
  on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy.” The
  post, which was accompanied by the Beatles song Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, continued:
  “And then there were 3.” Brown, best known for her role as Eleven in the
  Netflix drama Stranger Things, and Bongiovi, a model who is the son of the
  musician Jon Bon Jovi, married last October after their engagement in 2023.
  Alongside photos from their wedding last year, Bongiovi wrote in a post at the
  time: “Forever and always, your husband.” Brown has previously spoken about
  wanting to become a parent, adding that she wanted a large family with her
  husband. She mentioned the possibility of adopting. Speaking in March on the
  SmartLess podcast, hosted by Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett, the
  actor said: “Jake knows how important it is to me [to have a child].” Brown,
  who recently appeared alongside Chris Pratt in sci-fi film The Electric State,
  added: “Of course, I want to focus on really establishing myself as an actor
  and as a producer, but I also find it’s so important to start a family, for
  me, personally.” In 2023, the publication of Brown’s debut novel reignited a
  debate over ghostwritten celebrity books. Nineteen Steps, inspired by her
  grandmother’s experience of the 1943 Bethnal Green tube disaster, was
  ghostwritten by author Kathleen McGurl yet the cover of the book featured only
  Brown’s name. In response to a subsequently deleted tweet by Waterstones
  promoting the book, many X users had criticised the star. Brown had posted an
  image on Instagram of herself holding the book standing next to McGurl, with
  the caption: “I couldn’t have done this without you!” Zoella (the media
  personality Zoë Sugg), Katie Price and Naomi Campbell are among celebrities
  who have also used ghostwriters for their fiction books.
