  A broad section of Britain’s right has spent the summer behaving as if it
  would like a repeat of last year’s racist riots. As politicians and
  commentators cry “tinderbox Britain” – are they warning us, or willing it on?
  – far-right extremists have been actively trying to stoke violence. This year,
  they have pinned their hopes on asylum hotels, an issue where public fears
  over crime, immigration and the welfare state conveniently converge. In some
  places, far-right activists have piggybacked on protests prompted by local
  grievances. The most significant this year was in Epping, Essex, after an
  alleged sexual assault by an asylum seeker led to demonstrations that turned
  violent when they were joined by members of various far-right groups. A
  similar pattern has unfolded in London’s Canary Wharf, after untrue rumours
  that some of the Epping hotel residents were being moved there. In other
  cases, far-right activists have themselves organised the protests. A call has
  gone out among their online networks for gatherings this weekend in several
  parts of England. It is unlikely – though not impossible – that the end result
  will be on the scale of the riots we saw last summer, since that was triggered
  by a shocking act of murder followed by widespread misinformation and
  conspiracy theories about the identity of the killer. But anti-fascist
  campaigners I’ve spoken to believe it may cause lower-level disturbances like
  those seen in Epping and in Knowsley, Merseyside, in 2023, and it will
  certainly help ensure that asylum hotels remain a contentious topic for many
  months to come. One question, however, often goes unanswered: why are asylum
  seekers being accommodated in hotels in the first place? Before 2020, the
  phenomenon hardly existed, yet by its peak in 2023 there were more than 55,000
  people in hotels, waiting many months to have their asylum claims processed.
  (Today the number has dropped to about 30,000.) For some, the answer will be:
  “because there are too many people seeking asylum in the UK and we don’t have
  the resources to support them”. This is misleading. Although Britain has seen
  higher numbers of asylum applications in recent years, according to Oxford
  University’s Migration Observatory they are not exceptional when compared with
  those of other European countries. Yet the UK relies on costly hotel
  accommodation far more heavily than any of its neighbours. A series of actions
  by both Labour and Conservative governments since the turn of the century has
  brought us to this point. The first was the decision by Tony Blair’s
  government to make people seeking asylum heavily reliant on state support.
  Until mid-2002, asylum seekers could take up jobs if they had to wait more
  than six months for an initial decision on their asylum claim. Much of the
  press disliked this, saying it allowed asylum seekers to take other people’s
  jobs. So the government in effect banned them from working. (In many other
  European countries, people seeking asylum are still allowed to work after a
  waiting period.) If a government bans people from working then it needs to
  provide them with essential support, unless it is happy for them to starve to
  death on the streets. At first, accommodation was largely provided by local
  councils’ housing departments. But politicians took a second decision, which
  was to privatise the accommodation. This began in the late 2000s, but the
  really important step was taken by David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s coalition
  government. In 2012, as part of the coalition’s wider austerity drive, asylum
  accommodation was outsourced to the same profit-driven contractors that now
  run many of our public services. The contractors often failed to provide
  decent housing or value for money and the government had to rewrite the
  contracts. Even then, problems persisted: by the end of the decade, it was
  becoming increasingly common to house asylum seekers in “contingency
  accommodation” such as short-term lets and hotels. The third decision, taken
  by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, was to
  sabotage the asylum system itself. During the first Covid lockdown in 2020,
  people seeking asylum were placed in hotels – which, at the time, were largely
  empty anyway – for public health reasons. This coincided with a rise in the
  number of people crossing the Channel by small boat, as opposed to stowing
  away in lorries as they had largely done previously. (Many people who choose
  such routes do so because they do not have the option of a safe resettlement
  scheme, such as the one the UK has offered to Ukrainian refugees.) The
  Conservative government encouraged hostility towards small boat journeys,
  describing them as an “invasion”. Instead of moving asylum seekers out of
  hotels and into more suitable accommodation when the pandemic subsided, it
  kept them there while it built prison-like encampments as an alternative.
  (These schemes mostly never got off the ground.) At the same time, it allowed
  a backlog of asylum applications to grow – and then tried to ban many asylum
  seekers from claiming asylum at all, saying it would instead deport them
  permanently to Rwanda. (That scheme never got off the ground either.) All the
  above has led to more asylum seekers living in more hotels for longer, in more
  parts of the country. At its root, it is a story of public penny-pinching and
  market forces causing a problem that is then made worse by politicians
  promising a quick fix or finding a convenient scapegoat. If that sounds
  familiar then perhaps it’s because it’s a story we also find in our hospitals,
  schools and wider communities. This could be an occasion to ask what has gone
  wrong with the state more generally, and to talk about what could be done to
  make it work better for everyone. Keir Starmer’s government has promised to
  end the use of hotels by 2029, by investing in the asylum system and reducing
  small boat journeys. But if it is unwilling to have that wider conversation,
  then the right is ready with its own seductive, destructive answers. Daniel
