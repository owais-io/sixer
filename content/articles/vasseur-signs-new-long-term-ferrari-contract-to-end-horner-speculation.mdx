  Ferrari have ended speculation about the future of their team principal, Fred
  Vasseur, by agreeing a new, multi-year contract with the Frenchman. The deal
  closes the door on belief that the team were considering a move for Christian
  Horner. Vasseur, who was instrumental in bringing Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari,
  has been under pressure with the Scuderia underperforming in what was expected
  to be a strong season. The team are yet to win a grand prix this year. Vasseur
  joined Ferrari in 2023, replacing Mattia Binotto, and has been central in
  implementing an overhaul of the team, which has not won a drivers’ title since
  2007 and a constructors’ championship since 2008. The team secured five wins
  last season and finished second in the constructors’ championship, leading to
  high expectations for Hamilton’s first season. The expected step forward has
  not materialised and Ferrari remain firmly outpaced by McLaren who have
  established a dominant advantage over the rest of the field. This led to talk,
  particularly in the Italian media, that Vasseur’s future was in doubt with his
  contract up at the end of this season and suggestions Ferrari were considering
  bringing in Horner, who was dismissed by Red Bull three weeks ago. However,
  before this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari announced it will stick
  with Vasseur. “I’m grateful for the trust Ferrari continues to place in me,”
  he said. “This renewal is not just a confirmation, it’s a challenge to keep
  progressing, to stay focused, and to deliver. Over the past 30 months, we’ve
  laid strong foundations and now we must build on them with consistency and
  determination. We know what’s expected and we’re all fully committed to
  meeting those expectations and taking the next step forward together.” Ferrari
  did not specify the length of the contract, saying only that it was a
  multi-year deal, and reaffirmed their faith in the Frenchman to produce
  success for the team. “Fred joined the Scuderia at the beginning of 2023,
  bringing with him extensive motorsport experience and a proven ability to
  develop talent and build competitive teams across all levels of racing,” they
  said. “Since then, he has laid a solid foundation with the ambition of
  returning Ferrari to the top of Formula One.” Ferrari are second in the
  constructors’ championship, but 268 points behind McLaren. Hamilton enjoyed a
  victory in the sprint race in China, but at sixth in the championship he has
  still yet to score a podium after 13 races, the longest he has gone into a
  season without a top three finish.
