  Going out: Cinema The Naked Gun Out now Following a slightly tortuous period
  in development, a new Naked Gun film is in cinemas with Liam Neeson playing
  the son of legendary Det Sgt Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen in the three
  original films). Also starring Pamela Anderson and Busta Rhymes. Late Shift
  Out now A nurse on an understaffed surgical ward in a Swiss hospital, Floria
  (Leonie Benesch), takes her work seriously. But as she cares for a sick young
  mother and an elderly man, she finds herself caught in a race against time, in
  this acclaimed drama from Petra Volpe, which premiered at the Berlinale.
  Sophia Loren: Hollywood Style, Neapolitan Spirit BFI Southbank, to 31 August
  Like Marilyn Monroe or James Dean, the mere words “Sophia Loren” bring to mind
  a particular image. In Loren’s case, it’s a particularly Italian sense of
  glamour, sophistication and elegance. To celebrate, the BFI is putting on a
  Sophia Loren season. Saluti! Savages Out now Fresh from a special screening at
  Cannes this year, this stop-motion animation, influenced thematically by Hayao
  Miyazaki’s Princess Mononoke (itself back in cinemas in a couple of weeks),
  tells the story of an orphaned orangutan, rescued from a palm oil plantation.
  Directed by Claude Barras (My Life As a Courgette). Catherine Bray * * * Going
  out: Gigs Boardmasters Watergate Bay &amp; Fistral Beach, Newquay, 6, to 10
  August Cornwall’s singing and surfing extravaganza returns with a lineup
  headlined by Raye, Central Cee and the Prodigy. Other artists serenading the
  sea include Leigh-Anne, Flo, Wet Leg and, as seems obligatory for every
  festival this year, Natasha Bedingfield. Michael Cragg Jin The O2, London, 5
  &amp; 6 August With BTS returning next year after each member completes their
  time in the South Korean military, the band’s vocalist Jin is heading to
  London for two solo shows. Expect songs from his two mini-albums – including
  the Gary Barlow-penned Running Wild – plus some BTS bangers. MC The Veil of
  the Temple Usher Hall, Edinburgh, 2 August A rare performance of John
  Tavener’s eight-hour choral epic, the first in the UK since its 2003 premiere,
  launches this year’s Edinburgh international festival. This gigantic hymn,
  with texts in five languages and bringing together all the world’s major
  religions, is sung by the combined forces of the Monteverdi Choir, Edinburgh
  Festival Chorus and National Youth Choir of Scotland. Andrew Clements Brecon
  jazz festival Various venues, Brecon, 8 to 10 August The Brecon jazz festival,
  an innovative gem on the small Welsh scene that brought the genre’s jazz
  giants to the town, returns with Friday’s opening night show by UK vocal
  original, Jazz Warriors’ co-founder, reggae singer, DJ and more, Cleveland
  Watkiss performing his Great Jamaican Songbook on this curtain raiser. John
  Fordham * * * Going out: Art Virtual Beauty Somerset House, London, to 28
  September This exhibition takes you to the cutting edge, exploring how
  AI-enhanced selfies and artfully curated Instagrams are making virtual
  aesthetes of us all. Pioneering body artist Orlan, Turner nominee Sin Wai Kin,
  American self-portraitist Qualeasha Wood, and Björk colaborators Andrew Thomas
  Huang and James Merry are among the guides to this brave new digital world.
  Edinburgh art festival Various venues, 7 to 24 August A summer smorgasbord of
  art hits Edinburgh alongside its international and fringe festivals.
  Manchester punk icon Linder, Borgesian installationist Mike Nelson and painter
  John Bellany are among the varied fare. There is always something worth
  seeking out and, in this cityscape, the seeking itself is fun as you climb and
  delve. Millet National Gallery, London, 7 August to 19 October This French
  19th-century landscape artist who fascinated Van Gogh and Salvador Dalí
  depicts the countryside from the peasants’ point of view. The work of the
  fields, from sowing to gleaning and winnowing, becomes real yet also mythic in
  his art. This survey includes his haunting twilight masterpiece The Angelus.
  Animal Anima Mundi Gallery, St Ives, to 29 August Strange beasts have haunted
  art and folklore for thousands of years. They are common where the land meets
  the sea and you can imagine the old inns of Cornwall being regaled by fishers’
  tales of mermaids and sea serpents. Kate Clark, Jamie Mills, Lena Dabska and
  more update the bestiary. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage Jacqueline
  Novak Monkey Barrel 4, Edinburgh, to 23 August The Edinburgh
  fringe-workshopped, Emmy-nominated Get on Your Knees – an exquisitely funny
  treatise on the blowjob – established this New Yorker as one of the most
  impressive comedians around; whatever she brings to this year’s festival – and
  details are scarce – will be more than worth your while. Rachel Aroesti Robert
  Cohan: Gala Performance Dance City, Newcastle Upon Tyne, 2 August Eliot Smith
  Dance celebrates the centenary of Robert Cohan. The American, who died in
  2021, was instrumental in bringing modern dance to the UK, founding Britain‘s
  first contemporary dance school and company, and was an influential and much
  loved figure. The programme includes Cohan’s 1961 duet Eclipse. Lyndsey
  Winship Far Away Ambika P3, London, 5 to 23 August LostText/Found Space stages
  startling plays in unusual spaces. This time it’s Caryl Churchill’s Far Away,
  in which nature warps and bends as a young girl screams at night – all playing
  out in a former concrete construction hall. Miriam Gillinson Ohio Assembly
  Roxy, Edinburgh, to 24 August A new musical written by and starring married US
  indie-folk duo the Bengsons. A musician loses his faith. Can he find himself
  again through his music? MG * * * Staying in: Streaming Wednesday Netflix, 6
  August Tim Burton’s spectacularly successful Addams Family spin-off returns to
  Nevermore Academy, where our mordant, mystery-solving protagonist gets a
  hero’s welcome – much to her dismay. But soon Wednesday’s imagination is
  captured by something even more awful: a premonition of her roomie’s impending
  death. The Count of Monte Cristo U&amp;Drama, 2 August, 9pm A Danish director,
  British stars, Italian writers, French source material: this pan-European
  drama’s credits alone feel like a triumph in the Brexit era. Sam Claflin plays
  the wrongly imprisoned protagonist; Jeremy Irons is the priest who tells him
  the location of a life-changing fortune. Platonic Apple TV+, 6 August
  Following his success with The Studio, Apple’s current golden boy Seth Rogen
  reunites with Rose Byrne for a second season of the pair’s goofy buddy comedy
  about two friends from college who reconnect in midlife – and whose attempts
  to support each other frequently end in catastrophe. Parenthood BBC One &amp;
  iPlayer, 3 August, 7.20pm When it comes to child-rearing in the animal
  kingdom, nature documentaries tend to focus on extreme neglect or
  heartwrenching peril: this new five-parter takes a different tack, by
  examining how parents impart valuable knowledge to their offspring. RA * * *
  Staying in: Games Mafia: The Old Country Out 8 August; PS5, Xbox Series X/S,
  PC Ever watched Robert De Niro in Godfather Part II and thought: I could do
  that? Here’s your chance. The fourth main title in the underworld action
  adventure series takes us back to 1900s Sicily, where we must guide junior
  mobster Enzo Favara to the top of the Torrisi crime family by any means
  necessary. Surely an offer we can’t refuse. Gradius Origins Out 7 August; PC,
  PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch Konami’s space shooter series has been thrilling
  and frustrating gamers since 1985, and this collection brings together seven
  titles, including the original Gradius trilogy, the spin-off Salamander titles
  and the upgraded Salamander remix, Life Force. Keith Stuart * * * Staying in:
  Albums The Armed – The Future Is Here and Everything Needs to Be Destroyed Out
  now After going fully meta on 2023’s Perfect Saviors by critiquing the concept
  of rock stardom via an album full of arena rock, the mysterious collective
  return with an all-guns-blazing hardcore album. Well Made Play might start
  like the Killers but soon sounds like an aneurysm. Reneé Rapp – Bite Me Out
  now The 25-year-old actor, singer and non-stop quote machine (see her recent
  interview with comedian Ziwe), returns with her second album of bolshy pop
  bops. Singles Mad and Leave Me Alone are pepped-up vessels for brattish anger,
  while Why Is She Still Here? showcases Rapp’s full-bodied voice. Wisp – If Not
  Winter Out now On Natalie R Lu’s debut album, the San Franciscan combines
  shoegaze and heavy rock, her featherlight voice often tossed about on waves of
  crashing guitars. That’s showcased best on the heaving Breathe Onto Me, while
  electronic textures sparkle around the edge of Sword. Laura Groves – Yes Out
  now This four-track follow-up to 2023’s Radio Red album finds Shipley-born
  singer, songwriter and producer Groves offering up more heartfelt,
  80s-indebted soft-pop. Featuring collaborations with the likes of Joviale and
  Fabiana Palladino, it’s a perfect showcase for her sonic world-building and
  melodic prowess. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food Leading Labour Podcast
  Historian Izzy Conn’s series on Labour party leaders is a fascinating insight
  into the ways the party has navigated leftwing politics from 1945 onwards.
  Experts analyse how each postwar leader rose to power and their legacy. Inside
  NPR’s Tiny Desk YouTube YouTube series Tiny Desk began in 2008 as a showcase
  of stripped-down musicianship and has since developed to become a key industry
  tastemaker. This Architectural Digest video explores its meteoric rise. What
  Happened to Counter-Culture? Radio 4, 7 August, 9am Stewart Lee delves into
  the history of counterculture in this engaging five-part series. From beat
  poetry to free jazz and punk, Lee speaks to the artists who shaped the
