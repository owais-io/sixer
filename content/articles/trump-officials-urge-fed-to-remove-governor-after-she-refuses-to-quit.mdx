  The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to
  remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention
  of being bullied” into stepping down. Cook, who was appointed to the US
  central bank’s powerful board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused by
  Donald Trump’s officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are
  unconfirmed. The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the Fed’s
  independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge
  its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on
  Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is
  investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the
  case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from
  the Fed’s board. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your
  Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg
  News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is
  appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”
  The Fed declined to comment. The justice department declined to comment.
  Despite Martin’s demand, the Fed chair has no authority under the Federal
  Reserve Act to remove another member of the board of governors. On Wednesday,
  the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had discussed how to fire Cook for
  cause, citing an unnamed administration official. The White House did not
  respond to a request for comment on the report. On Wednesday morning, Bill
  Pulte, head of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has become – beyond
  the president himself – one of the Trump administration’s most vocal critics
  of Powell and the Fed, published allegations against Cook. Pulte says the
  finance agency is investigating a third property owned by Cook. In June 2021,
  Cook entered into a 15-year mortgage agreement on a property in Ann Arbor,
  Michigan, and declared her intention to use it as her principal residence,
  according to Pulte. In July 2021, Cook bought a property in Atlanta, Georgia,
  and also committed to use that property as her primary residence when taking
  out a 30-year mortgage, according to Pulte. In a statement, Cook said: “I do
  intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member
  of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to
  answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.” She is the latest
  figure to be targeted by Trump officials over claims of mortgage fraud. Pulte
  has made similar allegations about the New York attorney general, Letitia
  James, and the California senator Adam Schiff, both Democrats. The justice
  department is reportedly investigating. James has dismissed the claims as
  “baseless”, while Schiff has vehemently denied the allegations, and accused
  the administration of weaponizing the US justice system.
