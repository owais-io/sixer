  Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy reveals huge Flamingo cruise missile as no
  peace in sight

  With both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war preparing for further fighting,
  Ukraine was test-launching a new long-range cruise missile, Zelenskyy said.
  Ukraine’s president announced the huge missile, known as Flamingo, could
  strike targets as far as 3,000km (1,864 miles) away. “The missile has
  undergone successful tests. It is currently our most successful missile,”
  Zelenskyy told reporters. Mass production could begin by February, he added.
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that large Russian attacks in various
  parts of Ukraine showed Moscow was avoiding negotiations about ending the more
  than three-year-old war. The latest offensive included 574 drones and 40
  missiles, said Ukraine’s president, and was one of the largest yet. A missile
  strike on the US-owned electronics firm Flex in Ukraine’s far-west Zakarpattia
  region was a “telling” indicator of Russian intentions in peace initiatives
  led by Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said. “Now the signals from Russia are simply,
  to be honest, indecent. They are trying to back away from the need to hold
  meetings. They don’t want to end the war. They carry on with massive strikes.”
  “We believe [the Flex attack] was a deliberate strike precisely on US property
  here in Ukraine, on American investment,” Zelenskyy said. “A very telling
  strike … at the very time when the world waits for a clear answer from the
  Russians on their move in talks to bring an end to the war.” Nineteen people
  were injured in the attack. Zelenskyy said both sides were preparing for
  further fighting, citing Russian troop build-ups and Ukraine’s own
  preparations including the Flamingo missile rollout. While he has upended a
  years-long western policy of isolating the Russian leader, Trump has made
  little tangible progress towards a peace deal. On Thursday, the US president
  appeared to vent his frustration at Russia’s obstruction, and suggested
  Ukraine should long since have been armed to “fight back” against Russia,
  writes Pjotr Sauer. In a ramble on social media blaming his predecessor, Joe
  Biden, Trump said: “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without
  attacking an invader’s country … There is no chance of winning! It is like
  that with Ukraine and Russia.” Trump signed off that there were “interesting
  times ahead!”. Moscow attempted on Thursday to further deeply caveat any
  prospects for talks with Putin, or for peace on any terms other than Russia’s.
  Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister, said putting European troops in
  Ukraine to guarantee its security was “foreign intervention” and absolutely
  unacceptable for Russia. He insisted the Kremlin must have a veto over any
  postwar support for Ukraine. Trump set another timeframe – two weeks again –
  for assessing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. “After that, we’ll have
  to maybe take a different tack,” Trump told the rightwing media outlet
  Newsmax. Trump has not met any of his promised or threatened deadlines for
  securing peace or acting against Russia, which have ranged everywhere from 24
  hours to 10 weeks. In an attack on Ukraine’s western city of Lviv, one person
  was killed, three wounded and 26 homes damaged, said the governor, Maksym
  Kozytskyi. Authorities in south-eastern Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region
  reported damage to businesses, homes and gas lines. A later shelling of the
  city of Kherson killed one person and wounded more than a dozen, a local
  official said. In the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, two
  people were killed and at least 21 wounded after a Ukrainian shelling, said a
  Russian-installed official. Kim Jong-un held a ceremony decorating North
  Korean troops who fought for Russia, state media KCNA said on Friday. The
  North Korean ruler has sent about 15,000 troops into the war, according to
  South Korea, with about 600 of them killed.
