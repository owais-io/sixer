  Police chief attacks Reform UK promise to scrap equality policies as
  ‘ludicrous’

  The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is
  “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the
  country’s most senior chief constables has said. Serena Kennedy retires on
  Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four
  years in charge. She led its response to the Southport dance class murders
  last year, the riots that followed and led the way on giving ethnicity and
  nationality details of suspects, to counter disinformation. In a wide-ranging
  interview with the Guardian, Kennedy said the riots in Southport started with
  “carloads” of people arriving to attack a mosque, and dismissed claims that
  asylum seekers were to blame for a crime wave. She also called for a new
  national scheme to counter violence, and criticised politicians including the
  Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of
  heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport riot.
  Reform UK, which recently won local councils and is predicted to win more in
  elections next May, is vowing to scrap what it calls DEI initiatives – the
  term used by Donald Trump supporters – on diversity, equity and inclusion.
  Kennedy said: “I have a real nervousness that we are going backwards in
  relation to diversity and equality.” She said those groups with less
  confidence in policing and other public services, such as ethnic minorities
  and women, needed efforts by key institutions such as the police to win their
  trust back. Kennedy said: “Is it acceptable for policing and the public sector
  to stop worrying about those people where there is a confidence gap and say,
  well that’s just tough, and we’ll let that confidence gap get even wider? …
  Absolutely not. That’s why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies
  and the focus on it are so important. “Because the lines that are being
  trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally’ – yeah, we should.
  Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the
  public sector, but unfortunately they don’t. “And to level up that confidence
  gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to
  do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture,
  and externally. “To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that
  you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service
  without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.” Kennedy’s
  retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but
  also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by
  rightwing political figures. She said political attacks on diversity and
  inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the
  streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened: “Seeing the
  disorder that’s out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around
  immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out
  there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce. “So I do think
  we’re on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work
  really hard not to go backwards.” The toughest challenge in her four years as
  chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot
  Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, after a man burst into a
  Southport dance class and stabbed several children. The next day a vigil to
  commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town by riots
  that spread across the country and were the worst in more than a decade.
  Kennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the
  ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped
  off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled
  very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were
  thrown at the mosque.” Kennedy said claims those taking to the street were
  typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white
  working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked
  mosque and clear up. In the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and
  deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely
  claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took
  the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information
  that the suspect was British-born. The chief constable said she doubted that a
  quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the
  riots. She pointed to this May’s incident where a car went into crowds
  celebrating Liverpool FC’s Premier League title victory. The incident in
  Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not,
  but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online. Kennedy recalled how
  her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said:
  “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person …
  because what we’d put out didn’t suit the narrative that they wanted to swell
  in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.” She
  said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of
  the Southport riot said the authorities might be wrongly hiding key details
  from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians
  were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the
  impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it
  wasn’t in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social
  media.” Kennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”,
  and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are
  having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing,
  communities and partners are being left to deal with.” She dismissed claims of
  asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I’m not seeing
  anything out of kilter … It’s just, it’s more newsworthy.”
