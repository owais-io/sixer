  Régis Le Bris hopes to sign another striker before the transfer window music
  stops on Monday night but maybe, just maybe, Wilson Isidor gave Sunderland’s
  manager stoppage-time pause for thought. Isidor stepped off the bench to score
  his second goal in three Premier League appearances as Le Bris’s team made it
  two wins from three. With this degree of defensive organisation allied to Enzo
  Le Fée’s creative midfield flair they could yet make a successful adaptation
  to their new top-tier habitat. “Enzo understands football,” said Le Bris after
  acknowledging a match of “fine margins” had gone Sunderland’s way. “He can
  play different positions. He made a massive impact.” Like Le Bris, Brentford’s
  ultimately “very disappointed” manager Keith Andrews is clearly no mug when it
  comes to setting up a team, he just lacked a striker to fill the huge gap
  vacated by the once-again absent Yoane Wissa. Andrews reiterated he “fully
  expects” Wissa to still be a Brentford player on Tuesday. Andrews does at
  least have Dango Ouattara. Le Bris was probably not too surprised when the
  22-year-old controlled a lovely first-half reverse pass from Nathan Collins
  before embarking on a run that would sweep him between Sunderland’s central
  defensive partnership of Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete. Indeed Le Bris
  looked suitably resigned when Brentford’s club record £42.5m summer signing
  from Bournemouth proceeded to roll a wonderfully audacious shot beyond a
  deceived Robin Roefs. Le Bris had seen it all before; after all he was the
  coach who spent countless hours honing Ouattara’s game, first in Lorient’s
  reserve side and then the first team. All that work ultimately helped earn the
  Burkina Faso winger a £20m transfer to Bournemouth and now he was relishing a
  chance to remind his mentor just how good he is. Not that he could quite
  outwit a VAR check that, in highlighting his fractional offside, rode to
  Sunderland’s rescue. In showing off some impressive passing and movement, not
  to mention fluid positional interchanging, the home side had frequently looked
  assured but, despite some nice touches from Le Fée – incidentally another
  graduate of the French football factory otherwise known as Lorient – they
  created relatively little of menace. That was partly down to Jordan
  Henderson’s presence at the base of Brentford’s midfield. On his return to the
  club where he began his career and once enjoyed local-hero status, Henderson
  played well, slowing things down when necessary and contributing the odd
  high-calibre, long through-pass. Le Bris must have been suitably relieved that
  another of his Lorient proteges was not around to connect with those
  deliveries. Andrews had left Wissa behind in London as the DR Congo striker
  continued to agitate for a move to Newcastle. Those present on Wearside
  watched two smartly drilled sides cancelling each other out for long periods.
  If that was down largely to the tactical choreography of Le Bris and Andrews
  it also had quite a bit to do with the tempo-controlling presence of Henderson
  and Granit Xhaka. Sunderland explored the possibility of signing Henderson
  from Ajax this summer but instead recruited Xhaka from Bayer Leverkusen to
  perform a similar on-field leadership role. Yet as much as the former Arsenal
  midfielder played a key part in containing Brentford, Andrews’s team would
  have taken the lead had Roefs, Sunderland’s impressive Netherlands Under-21
  goalkeeper, not saved Kevin Schade’s second-half penalty awarded after
  Reinildo Mandava hauled Collins down off the ball. Schade looked mortified
  after aiming his kick far too close to the keeper and then relieved when Habib
  Diarra proved unequal to a Le Fée cross that begged to be volleyed past
  Caoimhín Kelleher. A reminder that chances need to be taken was swiftly issued
  by Brentford. When Igor Thiago met Frank Onyeka’s cross, even Roefs had no
  answer to the ensuing headed finish and Sunderland were behind. Onyeka had
  swiftly made his mark after replacing Henderson, who departed to a
  heartwarming standing ovation from his former fans. An even louder cheer
  greeted the penalty Le Fée directed hard, low and cleanly into the bottom
  right-hand corner, after Rico Henry pulled down Diarra. All that remained was
  for Xhaka to exchange passes with Le Fée before whipping in a 96th-minute
  cross. Isidor, whose partner gave birth to their daughter on Friday, delighted
  in celebrating a memorable couple of days with a scoring header Kelleher
  touched but could not hold.
