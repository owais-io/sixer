  The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, has vowed to protect the Democratic
  members of the Texas house of representatives who left the state in an attempt
  to block Republican efforts to redraw Texas’s congressional maps. “We’re going
  to do everything we can to protect every single one of them and make sure that
  – ’cause we know they’re doing the right thing, we know that they’re following
  the law,” Pritzker said at a press conference on Sunday in Illinois alongside
  some of the the Texas Democratic lawmakers. The Texas Democrats fled the state
  on Sunday in an effort to prevent the Texas house from reaching the quorum on
  Monday needed to vote on a newly proposed congressional map. In response to
  the Democrats’ actions, Greg Abbott, the Republican Texas governor, threatened
  to expel the Texas Democrats from the state house if they do not return by
  Monday at 3pm CT – when the legislature is set to resume. Ken Paxton, Texas’s
  Republican attorney general, also condemned their actions on Sunday and
  threatened their arrest. “Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away
  like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol
  immediately,” he said in a statement. “We should use every tool at our
  disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.” But Pritzker,
  who said he will support the Texas Democrats, described their actions as “a
  righteous act of courage”, saying that they “were left no choice but to leave
  their home state, block a vote from taking place, and protect their
  constituents”. Pritzker, a billionaire and potential 2028 presidential
  candidate, is reportedly helping the Democrats find lodging and meeting
  spaces, but is not assisting with the $500-a-day fine that each lawmaker will
  have to pay under new rules the house adopted in 2021, according to the Texas
  Tribune. The outlet reported that the Democrats have been fundraising from
  large Democratic donors to help pay that fine. The redistricting plan,
  unveiled last week by Texas Republicans, could allow Republicans to gain as
  many as five additional US House seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
  Currently, Republicans hold 25 of Texas’s 38 seats, and in the overall House
  of Representatives, Republicans hold a small majority of 220-212. The proposal
  came after pressure from Donald Trump, who urged Texas Republicans to redraw
  the maps. “There could be some other states we’re going to get another three,
  or four or five in addition. Texas would be the biggest one,” Trump told
  reporters in mid-July. “Just a very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats.”
  Abbott called a special session this summer and included on the agenda the
  redrawing of Texas’s maps in addition to proposals to aid victims of the 4
  July Texas flooding and other matters. Many of Texas’s 62 house Democrats have
  gone to Illinois, with others attending the National Conference of State
  Legislatures in Boston this week and others meeting with the New York
  governor, Kathy Hochul, in Albany. “We’re leaving Texas to fight for Texans,”
  Gene Wu, the Texas house Democratic caucus chair who fled to Illinois, said in
  a statement on Sunday. “We’re not walking out on our responsibilities; we’re
  walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we
  represent” he added. During the news conference in Illinois on Sunday,
  Pritzker criticized the redistricting proposal, saying it would “steal five
  congressional seats, silencing millions of voices, especially Black and Latino
  voters”. “Let’s be clear, this is not just rigging the system in Texas, it’s
  about rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to
  come,” he added.
