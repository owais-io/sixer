  A record number of reports of abuse at matches in English football were made
  during the 2024-25 season, with complaints of sexism and misogyny driving the
  increase, according to new data from Kick It Out. The anti-discrimination
  organisation has published its annual survey, with figures showing there were
  1,398 reports of discriminatory behaviour made over the previous 12 months, up
  from 1,332 the year before. While the top line has remained roughly static,
  albeit having more than doubled since the 2021-22 total of 610, the makeup of
  those complaints has shifted. According to Kick It Out’s data, reports of
  sexism and misogyny rose by 67% on the year before, up from 115 to 192.
  Reports of online sexism rose by 72% while reports related to misogyny in
  youth football doubled. Within stadiums, 18 reports of sexist chanting at
  matches were recorded, almost equalling the total from the previous four
  seasons combined. The uptick in reporting is likely in part down to greater
  awareness, both of the tools available to combat abuse and of the women’s game
  itself. Kick It Out announced a reporting relationship with Her Game Too last
  year to call for a crackdown on sexist behaviour and for incidents to be
  incorporated into official police statistics. The rise in popularity in
  women’s football has been dogged by a growth in people criticising its
  validity, especially on social media. Ableist abuse also rose substantially
  last season, increasing by 45% on the year, but there was a small decline in
  homophobic abuse. Reports of racism also fell overall, though Kick it Out says
  racism remains “prevalent” online, and the number of incidents reported in the
  professional game increased from 223 to 245. “What we’re seeing now is that
  fans aren’t just reporting abuse, they’re demanding action,” Samuel Okafor,
  the chief executive of Kick It Out, said. “There’s been a clear shift this
  season in how people are calling out sexist behaviour, both online and in
  stadiums, and asking football to treat it as seriously as any other form of
  hate. “At the same time, it’s clear that online platforms are still falling
  short. The volume of abuse remains high, and too often those responsible face
  no consequences. Fans are doing their part by speaking up. It’s now up to
  football authorities, tech companies and government to show they’re listening,
  and to act.” Individuals who experience or witness discrimination at football
  matches, at whatever level, are encouraged to report the incident. Reports to
  Kick It Out can be made online, via email or through the organisation’s app.
