  Erik ten Hag has been sacked by Bayer Leverkusen after just three matches in
  charge. He was appointed as Xabi Alonso’s successor in May after the
  Bundesliga-winning coach left for Real Madrid. The former Manchester United
  manager was dismissed on Monday morning following Leverkusen’s 3-3 draw with
  Werder Bremen on Saturday. Leverkusen surrendered two late goals, including a
  94th-minute equaliser, despite Niklas Stark’s second-half red card for Bremen.
  Ten Hag’s only home match in charge was a 2-1 defeat by Hoffenheim on the
  opening weekend of the league season. Jarell Quansah had scored an early
  opener for Leverkusen before the visitors turned it around. They had beaten
  the fourth-tier side Sonnenhof Grossaspach 4-0 in the first round of the
  DFB-Pokal a week earlier. “A parting of ways at this early stage of the season
  is painful, but we felt it was necessary,” Leverkusen’s chief executive,
  Fernando Carro, said in a statement. “We remain committed to achieving our
  goals for the season – and to do that, we need the best possible conditions at
  all levels and across the entire first team. Now it’s a matter of fully
  implementing and utilising these conditions again.” Leverkusen’s managing
  director, Simon Rolfes, said: “This decision was not an easy one for us.
  Nobody wanted to take this step. However, the past few weeks have shown that
  building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly
  believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take
  the next steps in our development with a new setup.” Ten Hag becomes the third
  former Manchester United manager to be sacked in the space of a week, after
  Ole Gunnar Solskjær by Besiktas and José Mourinho by Fenerbahce.
