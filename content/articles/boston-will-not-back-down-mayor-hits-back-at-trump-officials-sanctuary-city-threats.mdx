  Boston’s mayor Michelle Wu has hit back sharply at the Trump administration’s
  legal threats over sanctuary city immigration policies, declaring that “Boston
  will not back down”. Wu told a news conference outside Boston’s city hall on
  Tuesday: “The US attorney general asked for a response by today, so here it
  is: stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike
  the Trump administration, Boston follows the law. And Boston will not back
  down from who we are and what we stand for.” Last week, the US Department of
  Justice sent letters to 13 states, from California to Rhode Island, and 22
  local governments, from Boston to Seattle, that it has deemed “sanctuary
  jurisdictions”, threatening their leaders with prosecution for allegedly
  “undermining” and “obstructing” federal immigration enforcement. The letters
  warned that they could lose federal funds or face legal action if they do not
  assist with Donald Trump’s sweeping, aggressive and highly controversial
  immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts. Attorney general Pam
  Bondi has warned that she intends to prosecute political leaders who are not –
  in her view - sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement. Bondi’s
  letter asked recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your
  commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate
  initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that
  impede federal immigration enforcement”. On Tuesday, Wu hit back publicly. The
  progressive Democratic mayor was elected in 2021 to run the state capital of
  Massachusetts, the first woman and first person of color to do so. At her
  press conference, she listed some of the what she deems the administration’s
  failures. “Under the Trump administration, groceries are less affordable,
  housing is harder to build, cures for cancer are farther away, and good news
  on our economy has been as hard to find as the Epstein list,” she said,
  essentially taunting both the US president and Bondi about an alleged list of
  financial clients of the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Wu’s
  address followed a blistering letter the mayor sent to Bondi earlier in the
  day, in which she asserted that Boston would not “bow down to unconstitutional
  threats or unlawful coercion” from the federal government. She also addressed
  the Trump administration at the news conference, saying: “You are wrong on the
  law and you are wrong on safety. Most of all, you are wrong on cities.” Trump
  has portrayed prominent, Democratic-run cities in recent days as being riddled
  with crime, following an extraordinary federal takeover of law enforcement in
  Washington DC. Highlighting measures Boston has taken to tackle crime, often
  in partnership with federal authorities, Wu noted in her letter to Bondi
  Boston police department’s close work with state and federal law enforcement
  agencies “to address counterterrorism threats, protect our airport and our
  harbor, combat drug and human trafficking and hold perpetrators accountable
  for crimes”. And blasting the Trump administration’s “false and continuous
  attacks on American cities”, Wu said cities like Boston were being “targeted
  by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional
  threats and unlawful coercion”. “Boston will never back down from being a
  beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone,” she wrote.
