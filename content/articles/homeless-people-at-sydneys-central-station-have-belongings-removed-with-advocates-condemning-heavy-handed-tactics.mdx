  Kylie Emery returned from a shower on Thursday morning to find her shopping
  trolley full of belongings was gone. It contained everything she has to her
  name: a sleeping bag, warm clothes, her credit card. Emery is among about two
  dozen people who have been sleeping rough at Sydney’s Central station, some
  for several years, in a sheltered spot near the light rail stop. The majority
  are women, who find the site safe because of its CCTV cameras and public
  location. On Thursday, at about 5am, the homeless sleepers were woken by
  police and told to move on for two hours, as happens most mornings. They have
  been told by police this is to avoid disruption for passengers during peak
  hour. When they returned, they found all their items had been covered in
  caution tape – and, for the first time, posters had been erected. “Please
  remove all your belongings by 12pm today 31/07/2025,” the laminated signs,
  which were not attributed, read, “or your items will be disposed afterwards.”
  Emery’s trolley was eventually returned by a cleaner, who had taken it
  downstairs, but she said her items had been moved and sorted through. Another
  man who also had his items taken, including his sleeping bag, was told by a
  cleaner that they had been thrown away. Sign up: AU Breaking News email While
  Emery’s belongings had been returned she had nowhere else to go and it was
  pouring with rain. Many of the women who lived there, including her, had been
  through complex trauma and struggle with PTSD, she said. “It’s unsafe for
  everyone [on the streets], but it’s extremely unsafe for us.” Emery said she
  had been on a priority list for housing for seven months, after experiencing a
  home invasion in Port Macquarie last year. “There’s no way I could go back
  there, it’s not safe,” she said. “I ring up [housing services] and they’re
  like, ‘Sorry, we can’t help you.’ “It’s horrible seeing ladies out here on the
  street. There are mothers and grandmothers here … we haven’t done anything
  wrong.” According to the New South Wales street count, the number of rough
  sleepers counted across the state has grown by nearly 70% in five years, from
  1,314 in 2020 to 2,192 in 2025. Systems are struggling to cope with demand. A
  report released by Mission Australia on Thursday found demand for its tenancy
  support services had surged to an all-time high, with a 52% increase in people
  seeking assistance between 2023 and 2024. The fastest-growing groups of people
  seeking support were employed people, young people and those escaping family
  and domestic violence. Dominique Rowe, the CEO of Homelessness NSW, said
  Sydney’s housing crisis was forcing more people, including women and children,
  to seek shelter in stations, parks and other public places. “People forced to
  sleep rough need suitable homes and trauma-informed support services, not
  heavy-handed move-on instructions from authorities,” Rowe said. “The
  government must urgently increase funding for stretched homelessness services
  so they can help more people in need.” Amanda, who did not want to use her
  surname, has been living at Central station for two-and-a-half years, except
  for a few brief stays in temporary accommodation. She had a doctor’s
  appointment on Thursday, but had to cancel it to guard her belongings. She
  said the warnings that belongings would be removed was the “harshest response”
  she had seen by authorities during her time sleeping at the station –
  particularly as they were targeting the entire group, not just individuals.
  “They’re saying we’re inhibiting passengers, but everyone’s getting on board
  [the light rail],” she said. If we were standing in front of trains, stopping
  the trains from moving, I would probably say that’s appropriate [to ask us to
  leave], but we aren’t.” Amanda said police had given the group warnings in the
  past, including to keep their belongings tidy and clean and to make sure
  benches were made available for passengers. “But when they moved us on this
  morning, they said if people didn’t take their belongings with them, they’d
  dispose of them,” she said. “They’ve never done that before. “And every time I
  put a complaint in to NSW police, I don’t get a response.” In most cases,
  police require a court warrant to lawfully remove property from public land.
  NSW councils can remove belongings or tell people to move on under certain
  circumstances, including those that threaten public health or safety. Alexia
  Smith has been staying at Central station for about five months and has been
  periodically homeless since arriving in Australia from the Philippines in
  2004. Two weeks ago, she said the group had been advised to move their
  belongings from inside the station to the undercover concourse. But nobody had
  offered them a long-term solution – a home. “They just create more problems on
  top of problems,” she said. “Australia shouldn’t treat people like this.” In a
  statement, a spokesperson for NSW police said move-on directions were issued
  “if a person is causing, or is likely to cause, inconvenience to other persons
  on railway premises” with removal or fines listed as possible consequences of
  non-compliance. “The NSW police force is part of a multi-agency response, in
  collaboration with Sydney Trains, NSW Health and Housing NSW, regarding the
  matter of homeless people at Central railway station,” the spokesperson
  continued. “Being homeless is not an offence, and NSW police will continue to
  work with the community and help homeless people make contact with appropriate
  services if needed.” The City of Sydney council declined to comment and
  referred Guardian Australia to Transport for NSW. A spokesperson for Transport
  for NSW said Sydney Trains was requested by NSW police to ask for the
  belongings to be removed and its staff “work closely” with the homeless
  community at the station. “Unattended belongings pose a risk in a transport
  hub like Central Station,” they said. “If unattended belongings are moved,
  they are able to be collected. Sydney Trains will hold belongings for at least
  24 hours.”
