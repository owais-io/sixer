  20. Glitter in Their Eyes (2000) Not all the politicking on Gung Ho landed
  right – Stange Messengers is unbearably clumsy – but Glitter in Their Eyes’
  plea for a younger generation not to get hooked on materialism is impressively
  punchy and potent, abetted by the presence on guitar of her old sparring
  partner, Television’s Tom Verlaine. 19. Don’t Say Nothing (1997) Like its
  predecessor, Gone Again, Peace and Noise was an album awash with loss and
  mourning. Don’t Say Nothing sounds like a note to self, a concerted effort to
  shake free from the torpor of grief and start over: “Gonna straighten up,
  gonna get well, I’m gonna do something, gonna face the fact.” 18. Space Monkey
  (1978) A streetwise rock’n’roll strut, married to a lyric in which an alien
  invasion, or possibly the revenge of simians used in space exploration, gets
  mixed up with the French actor Pierre Clémenti. If Easter was Smith’s most
  commercial album thus far, you never forgot you were in the presence of a
  one-off figure. 17. Paths That Cross (1988) Written for Robert Mapplethorpe
  after the death of his partner, Sam Wagstaff, the beautiful Paths That Cross
  offers a warm, optimistic view of eternity as “a glow we all will know”. Given
  that Mapplethorpe was also sick – he died within a year of the song’s release
  – you suspect Smith was equally engaged in preparing herself for his loss. 16.
  Frederick (1979) Wave received a mixed response – its poppy smoothness taken
  as evidence that Smith’s heart was no longer in it – but has grown in stature
  over the years. Frederick, the opener, is just fantastic, an unabashed
  proclamation of love that sounds almost giddy with excitement. 15. Privilege
  (Set Me Free) (1978) In the same way that Horses’ opening track transformed
  Van Morrison’s Gloria, so Privilege took the title song from the 1967 film
  about a pop star turned fake messiah and interpolated it with Psalm 23. What
  emerged was a song that seemed to speak loudly about Smith’s increasingly
  complex and troubled attitude to fame. 14. Redondo Beach (1975) On release,
  Rolling Stone called Horses “as original an original as they come”. Certainly,
  I struggle to think of another song like Redondo Beach, the grim story of a
  girl’s suicide on a beach patronised by gay men and women, set to an
  incongruously jaunty reggae-infused backing. 13. Dream of Life (1988) For an
  album with a decidedly varied reputation among Patti Smith fans – not everyone
  loves its straightforward, distinctly 80s-hued rock approach – Dream of Life
  has a remarkable number of great songs on it. The title track is a case in
  point: think of it as an older, wiser relation of Because the Night. 12.
  Mother Rose (2004) A reflection on the death of Smith’s mother, written from
  the perspective of a daughter who is now a mother herself, this is the
  highlight of Trampin’. “It’s not a grieving song … hopefully a really pretty
  song,” she clarified after its release. It is, indeed, utterly lovely: tender
  and atmospheric. 11. This Is the Girl (2012) Right from the start, Smith was
  big on writing about her dead heroes. The passing of Amy Winehouse added her
  to the pantheon of lost inspirations. This Is the Girl has a hint of
  Winehouse’s retro soul sound– or perhaps Smith’s beloved doo-wop – about it;
  the lyric is affecting, tender and maternal. 10. Gone Again (1996) This was
  the last song Smith wrote with her husband, Fred “Sonic” Smith, before his
  death, an event that transformed it from a paean to indigenous American
  culture to a eulogy for its co-author and a meditation on the transience of
  life: “The ashes’s rain / Death’s own bed / Man’s own kin / Into the wind.” 9.
  Free Money (1975) As close as Horses got to punk rock as the world would come
  to understand it – check out Penetration’s 1978 cover to hear how easily its
  three-chord riff adapted to the subsequent sonic template – with remarkably
  prosaic lyrics about winning the lottery. Its gradual build in pace is
  thrilling. 8. Piss Factory (1974) The deconstructed cover of Hey Joe on the
  A-side of Smith’s debut single was great, but the B-side is something else:
  autobiographical provincial ennui set to guitar and piano, its climactic burst
  of manifesting – “I’m gonna go on that train and go to New York City / I’m
  gonna be somebody!” – exhilarating and stirring. 7. Land: Horses/Land of a
  Thousand Dances/La Mer(de) (1975) Nine and a half incredible minutes that meld
  together the saga of a locker-room rape, a garage-band cover of the old
  R&amp;B standard – best known in Wilson Pickett’s 1966 version – references to
  cocaine, Smith’s favourite poet (“go Rimbaud!”) and “the sea of
  possibilities”. It sounds like nothing else, yet still rocks in time-honoured
  style. 6. People Have the Power (1988) Smith’s great latter-day anthem has had
  a long afterlife: it has turned up as U2’s live intro music and the theme for
  the 2004 Vote for Change campaign in the US. It’s obvious why: its
  rabble-rousing is optimistic and effective, its message – “the people have the
  power to redeem the work of fools” – perennially consoling. 5. Beneath the
  Southern Cross (1996) An extraordinary waltz-time dispatch from the depths of
  grief, Smith’s voice somewhere between incantation and a wail, that gradually
  builds from abjection to a kind of catharsis – “crossover boy!” – backed by
  ghostly guitar noise and an ethereal backing vocal (the last thing Jeff
  Buckley recorded). 4. Pissing in a River (1976) After the gamechanging
  explosion of Horses, its disjointed follow-up, Radio Ethiopia, divided
  opinion. Amid its confused stylistic lurches, the one thing everything seemed
  to agree on was that Pissing in a River’s brooding, glowering, increasingly
  desperate depiction of love gone sour was a slow-burning masterpiece. 3.
  Dancing Barefoot (1979) Smith has claimed that, growing up, she thought the
  coolest thing was “to be an artist’s mistress”. The finest song on Wave –
  subsequently covered by U2, Pearl Jam, Shakespears Sister and the Mission –
  was inspired by Jeanne Hébuterne, Modigliani’s muse and mistress, who died by
  suicide two days after the artist’s death. 2. Because the Night (1978) An
  unfinished Bruce Springsteen song, completed by Smith, Because the Night was
  parachuted on to Easter by the producer Jimmy Iovine in the quest for a big
  hit. It duly became one, partly because it was the most straightforward rock
  anthem Smith recorded, but mostly because it’s an incredible, irresistible
  song. 1 Gloria: In Excelsis Deo (1975) Smith’s debut album began with one of
  the most celebrated opening lyrics in pop history. But “Jesus died for
  somebody’s sins but not mine” was far from the most radical thing about
  Smith’s reimagining of Them’s garage-rock standard. It turns it inside out,
  transforming it from a song about male sexual desire to one about sexual
  desire from which men are excluded, sung in a voice unlike anything anyone had
  heard before: supremely cool and tough, but distinctly female. It was as if
  Smith was creating a new space – an “atmosphere where anything’s allowed”, as
  another lyric put it – before your ears. • The 50th anniversary edition of
  Horses is released on 10 October on Legacy Recordings. The Horses tour of the
  US and Europe begins on 6 October at the 3Arena, Dublin
