  Whenever I arrange dinner with one particular friend, we haggle. The date and
  venue are easy to sort out, but when it comes to what time we should convene,
  it’s always a lengthy negotiation. I make snide “jokes” about Grandma’s
  Earlybird Special, she reminds me we do not live in Spain, and slowly we meet
  in the middle, where neither of us is happy. Now it turns out that by wanting
  to have dinner at 6pm, she is extremely fashionable. Curses! It’s all down to
  pesky gen Z, of course. Not content with slating our no-show socks and banning
  the French tuck, they’re now making early evenings the new late nights when it
  comes to dining. According to the Times, online restaurant reservation service
  OpenTable reports a steep rise in 6pm bookings, up 11% in London and 6% across
  the UK compared with the same period last year. And Zonal, the hospitality
  tech service, reveals the new national average dining time is 6.12pm. Joe
  Laker, the savvy chef and co-founder of Counter 71 in Shoreditch, London, has
  introduced a £50 early evening set menu as a result, and will surely not be
  the last to do so. The benefits here are clear: you get to socialise without
  staying up till all hours and being forced to skip your 972-step skincare
  routine; commuters don’t risk missing the last train; and eating a large meal
  after 8pm is generally considered to be worse for your health than dining
  earlier. But what about the inevitable knock-on effects of this new trend?
  After all, you’re unlikely to be hungry at 6pm if you had lunch at 2pm. At
  this rate, we might have to start setting our alarms for the middle of the
  night and having breakfast then, in order to squeeze in all our meals. But if
  that’s what it takes to keep up with gen Z, who am I to argue? • Do you have
