  Speaking in the Oval Office this week, Donald Trump had something he wanted to
  clarify. “I’m not a dictator. I don’t like a dictator,” the president said.
  Yet his comments came weeks after he deployed armed soldiers and Humvee-style
  military vehicles to patrol the streets of Washington, claiming, despite all
  available evidence, that the use of the national guard was necessary to
  control crime. The remarks followed Trump withholding, or threatening to
  withhold, billions of dollars from universities, and after the increasingly
  politicized FBI raid on the home of John Bolton, a prominent critic of Trump.
  Trump has also targeted law firms who have filed lawsuits he opposes, while
  the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, is
  investigating every major broadcast network except Fox, which owns the
  pro-Trump Fox News channel. Trump has personally sued news channels over
  critical coverage and fired the government’s top labour statistician because
  she published jobs data that he didn’t like. He has threatened Democrats with
  prosecution, and demanded that former president Barack Obama be investigated
  for treason. Trump has done all this as his family has ostensibly earned
  millions of dollars from his presidency. None of these things are typical for
  a democratic leader. So … is Trump a dictator? “Yes, of course,” said Kim Lane
  Scheppele, a professor of sociology at Princeton University who spent years
  researching autocracies including Hungary and Russia. Scheppele said she had
  been wavering on using the term “dictatorship” until recently, but said: “If I
  was hesitating before, it’s this mobilization of the national guard and the
  indication that he plans to overtake resistance by force that now means we’re
  in it.” Trump, emboldened by a Republican party that appears willing to let
  their leader do whatever he wants, is now threatening to send troops to
  Democratic-run cities including Chicago, Baltimore, San Francisco and New York
  City, prompting outcry and accusations of abuse of power. Scheppele said:
  “He’s really planning a military, repressive force, to go out into the streets
  of the places that are most likely to resist his dictatorship and to just put
  down the whole thing by force.” Most modern dictators try to hide their
  aspirations. Scheppele said leaders such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Hungary’s
  Viktor Orbán and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan have gone to “great lengths” to
  avoid looking like “20th-century dictators” in the hopes they can avoid the
  label. “If you think of dictators as, you know, tanks in the streets and large
  numbers of military people saluting the leader, and big posters of the leader
  going up on national buildings, all that stuff does remind everybody of
  Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia and all and Mussolini’s Italy,” she said.
  Hence Orbán, Erdoğan and the like attempting to avoid those scenes. But it
  doesn’t seem to bother Trump. Just this week, a giant banner was draped over
  the Department of Labor building, showing Trump glaring out over Washington DC
  above the slogan “American workers first”. On his birthday, which coincided
  with the 250th anniversary of the formation of the US army, he held a military
  parade in the capital, and was reportedly furious that the troops did not look
  “menacing” enough. In Trump’s first term, as he railed against political
  norms, the book How Democracies Die – which examined the unraveling of
  democracies around the world – became a bestseller. Steven Levitsky, the
  book’s co-author and a political scientist at Harvard University, said Trump
  has the mentality of “a classic tin-pot dictator”, but said the president
  hasn’t managed to become one so far. “Technically in political science terms,
  no, he’s not a dictator. The United States, I think, is collapsing into some
  form of authoritarianism. But it has not consolidated into an outright
  dictatorship,” Levitsky said. Trump has said he is not a dictator, but claimed
  last week: “A lot of people are saying: ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” It’s
  not clear who he was referring to, but he continued the theme on Tuesday. “The
  line is that I’m a dictator. But I stop crime. So a lot of people say: ‘You
  know, if that’s the case, I’d rather have a dictator,’” Trump said in a
  cabinet meeting. The Guardian asked the White House what data Trump was citing
  when he claimed Americans want a dictator, but did not receive a response.
  Levitsky reiterated that he does not believe Trump is a dictator in the truest
  sense, but added: “Dictators everywhere, first of all, claim that they’re not
  dictators. And second of all, somewhat contradictorally, claim that the people
  want a dictator. Those are classic dictator lines.” The US has expressed
  interest in authoritarianism before. At the height of his fame a third of
  Americans tuned into the radio broadcasts of Charles Coughlin, a Catholic
  priest whose antisemitic broadcasts praised the likes of Benito Mussolini. Jim
  Crow laws were allowed to enforce racial segregation into the 1960s, while
  Senator Joseph McCarthy was allowed to persecute alleged communists during the
  so-called Red Scare. “You could always, in many, many periods of US history,
  find 25, 30% of the US electorate that was authoritarian-leaning, and I think
  that’s definitely true today,” Levitsky said. Today, that makes up a “big
  chunk” of the Republican party, he said, and Trump is leaning into that base.
  “There’s a real performative side to this government’s authoritarianism, which
  suggests that there is a constituency for it, which is very frightening. And I
  really haven’t seen anything like this sort of performative authoritarianism,
  honestly, since the 30s in Europe,” he said. Most 21st-century authoritarian
  countries are “hybrid regimes”, Levitsky said. He pointed to Venezuela,
  Hungary, Tunisia and Turkey, where Erdoğan has spent more than two decades in
  power, cementing his position by cracking down on the country’s media and
  bringing thousands of criminal cases against people who insult the president.
  “They’re authoritarian, in that they’re not fully democratic: there’s
  widespread abuse of power that tilts the playing field against the opposition.
  So nobody would look at Turkey and say: ‘That’s a democracy.’ But they’re not
  what I would call a dictatorship. And that’s what I think the great danger is
  in the United States.” There is, Levitsky said, a “non-zero chance” that Trump
  could use emergency powers – as he has in justifying immigration measures and
  tariffs – to subvert the constitution, potentially undermining elections. But,
  he said: “The more likely outcome is a more mild authoritarianism where
  opposition exists, opposition is above board, opposition contests for power,
  competes in elections. “The government doesn’t win all its battles, but abuse
  of power – as we’ve seen in the last six, seven months – abuse of power is so
  widespread, so systematic, and violations of law, violations of rights are so
  widespread and systematic that the playing field begins to tilt against the
  opposition. “And you would not call that a full democracy.”
