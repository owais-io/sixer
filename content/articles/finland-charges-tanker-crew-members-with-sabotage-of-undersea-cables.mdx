  Finnish authorities have filed charges against members of the crew of an oil
  tanker suspected of damaging five undersea cables by dragging its anchor
  between Finland and Estonia. Finland’s deputy prosecutor general’s office said
  on Monday it had filed charges of aggravated sabotage and aggravated
  interference with telecommunications against the captain and first and second
  officers of the Eagle S. The Cook Islands-registered tanker is understood to
  be part of Russia’s “shadow fleet” – comprising vessels that sail under
  foreign flags to evade sanctions. The ship was carrying oil from Ust-Luga in
  Russia across the Gulf of Finland when, prosecutors allege, it dragged its
  anchor along the seabed for about 90km (56 miles) in December 2024. The
  incident was one of several suspected hybrid attacks on telecommunications
  services in the Nordic region at the end of last year, putting leaders on high
  alert and prompting accusations of infrastructure sabotage against Russia.
  Finnish authorities seized the Eagle S on 26 December last year when the
  border guard’s emergency response team and police landed on the ship in the
  early hours of the morning. The seizure was lifted in February and the ship
  left Finland the following month. Damage to the cables had cost their owners,
  Cinia and Elisa, “at least €60m in repair costs alone”, the office of the
  deputy prosecutor general, Jukka Rappe, said in a statement. It added: “The
  rupture of the extremely high-capacity electricity transmission and
  telecommunications cables is also suspected of having caused a serious danger
  to energy supply and telecommunications in Finland, although services have
  been secured by using alternative connections.” The defendants, it said, had
  denied any wrongdoing in the preliminary investigation. They believed that
  Finland “does not have jurisdiction in the matter because the cable damage
  sites are outside Finnish territorial waters”, the statement said. A lawyer
  for the United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLC FZ, the owner of the Eagle S,
  has said previously that Helsinki lacked jurisdiction to intervene. Rappe
  disagreed, saying: “The characteristics of the crimes,ie the dangers caused,
  occurred within the borders of Finland, even though the measures themselves
  were taken outside Finland.” He told the Guardian that the question of
  jurisdiction was “one of the critical questions”, but that “the effects of the
  crime materialised here in Finland. That brings it to the jurisdiction of
  Finland, I think. But of course it is up to [the] district court to decide
  whether Finland has jurisdiction or not.” He said he hoped the trial would
  have an impact on investigations into other alleged cable-cutting incidents in
  the region over the last two years. Because of its geographical positioning,
  between Russia and the Baltic, Finland is particularly vulnerable. “Finland is
  like an island because of the Baltic sea. All of our connections go via
  undersea cables to Sweden, Estonia and central Europe,” said Rappe. The
  indictment has been filed with the Helsinki district court, which will decide
  on a date for the hearing. The state prosecutor, special prosecutor and
  regional prosecutor have been assigned to prosecute the charges in court. The
  three suspects have been under a travel ban in Finland since the start of the
  investigation. Cinia and Elisa declined to comment.
