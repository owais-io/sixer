  New research suggests exposure to some common Pfas or “forever chemical”
  compounds causes changes to gene activity, and those changes are linked to
  health problems including multiple cancers, neurological disorders and
  autoimmune disease. The findings are a major step toward determining the
  mechanism by which the chemicals cause disease and could help doctors
  identify, detect and treat health problems for those exposed to Pfas before
  the issues advance. The research may also point toward other diseases
  potentially caused by Pfas that have not yet been identified, the authors
  said. The study is among the first to examine how Pfas chemicals impact gene
  activity, called epigenetics. “This gives us a hint as to which genes and
  which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona
  College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author. Pfas are a
  class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-,
  stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects,
  decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other
  serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do
  not naturally break down in the environment The study checked the blood of
  about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were
  exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most
  firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by
  firefighters because of their heat repelling properties Furlong said she was
  surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were
  impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a
  broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause
  certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede
  disease. Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and
  Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A
  gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it
  expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer. For
  example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces
  levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of
  PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate
  cancer development. Different Pfas and chemical structures were found to
  affect different genes, and were associated with different health outcomes.
  Not all compounds impacted gene expressions. The research found connections
  among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia,
  as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and
  biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer’s disease, and autoimmune and
  infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis. Furlong said it
  remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is
  triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments.
  Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene
  activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.
