  In a quiet corner of Vienna’s well-to-do 18th district, Jana is explaining how
  her assembly of wooden decking and planters is bringing a bit of greenery to
  the area. “There’s not a single tree on this whole street – it’s just parking
  spaces on both sides.” This is a grätzloase, or neighbourhood oasis – a
  miniature park tucked into the side of the road. With the blessing of the city
  hall, more than 100 of them have sprung up across Vienna. The scheme has been
  growing since 2015, and its proponents say it’s struck a rare balance for
  urban projects: cheap, community-driven and appreciated by local people. In
  theory, anyone in Vienna can build one. A city-funded organisation, Local
  Agenda 21, provides grants of up to €5,000 to cover construction costs and
  helps with the admin. Jana first heard about the scheme at a party in 2019
  from someone who had recently put a parklet together. “A few weeks later I
  just went by and looked at it and thought: ‘This is so cool,’” she recalls.
  But it took until the winter of 2020 for Jana and her flatmates to consider
  building one themselves. “It’s kind of complicated; you need to fill in a lot
  of paperwork,” she says. This involved three different departments of city
  government, and her group needed to cost everything up before they started.
  But she had a couple of things on her side. First, she lived with a carpenter,
  who could handle the nitty-gritty of actually building it. Second, the
  organisation told her there was another parklet being taken down on the other
  side of town that they could pick up and reassemble. The final hurdle was
  getting the street on board, with some residents pushing back against the
  idea. “While we were building it, I remember there were a few people looking
  at it very weirdly. A few days later, we had neighbours say: ‘Why would you
  take away a parking space?’” Jana says. But they seem to have come around.
  This spring the grätzloase saw more construction as they installed a
  retractable sunroof. “We had a weekend of building together. Everybody that
  walked by said: ‘Oh! This is so nice.’” The parklet is a huge source of pride
  for Jana, but it comes with certain challenges. In winter she has to deal with
  clearing snow from the decking, and during the summer the plants need watering
  every day. The grätzloase also includes a box where neighbours can exchange
  their unwanted things. “Sometimes people just leave trash there, and it’s up
  to me to figure out how to get rid of it,” Jana says. And as the person
  responsible for putting together the parklet, she’s also responsible for
  taking it down – should she ever move, she’ll need to find a new custodian or
  be forced to deconstruct it. Vienna consistently scores highly on
  environmental and livability rankings – even if its quality-of-life crown was
  nicked by Copenhagen in June. But these accolades obscure the fact that some
  districts are distinctly lacking in greenery, particularly in the centre-west
  of the city. “Vienna has more journeys by car than 26 cities in Europe,
  including London, Paris and Berlin,” says Rafael Prieto-Curiel, a researcher
  at the Complexity Science Hub in the city’s third district. He has collated
  mobility data from hundreds of places around the world. Despite its excellent
  public transport network, a quarter of journeys in Vienna are still taken by
  private vehicles – a figure that ought to be a lot lower, he argues. Removing
  parking spaces could be one way of encouraging this. “Asphalt gets super hot –
  so if you have less asphalt, the city is more livable,” Prieto-Curiel says.
  Research shows Vienna saw nearly 50 days of extreme heat last year, a number
  that’s been on the rise. He would like the city to go further and commit to
  tearing out paving en masse, as Paris has done recently. Building parklets
  could be one way of warming people up to the idea. Sabrina Halkic, the
  managing director of Local Agenda 21, describes them as an example of
  “tactical urbanism” – low-cost, often citizen-led improvements to the built
  environment. She sees the grätzloasen as a gateway to further changes. “Once
  people see that something can be done to make the situation better, they
  develop this bigger vision,” she says. In 2021, her organisation built a
  grätzloase in collaboration with a school: “We had [a parklet on] these four
  parking spaces. After those were a success, they said: ‘Why don’t we change
  the whole street?’” Last year they convinced the city to pedestrianise the
  entire road. Jana and Sabrina agree one of the scheme’s biggest pluses is it
  creates new places to hang out. In a city sometimes characterised – perhaps
  unfairly – as grumpy and unwelcoming, more communal space means a chance to
  chat to people you wouldn’t speak to otherwise. One Friday evening a group of
  friends is braving the drizzle to drink cocktails and catch up at the
  grätzloase. Even later on, at a time when some neighbours may start
  complaining about noise, it’s nothing but smiles and “good evenings” from
  people passing by. Jana compares her parklet with the fate of a restaurant one
  block over. It closed down a decade ago, with its chestnut tree-lined garden
  paved over to make way for new apartments. The grätzloase – a place where
  friends can meet for the sake of meeting – is showing that things can be
  different.
