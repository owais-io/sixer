  lives

  Marianne Faithfull led different lives and was cast in various roles. Some
  roles she chose and wrote herself; others were forced upon her, like an ugly
  hat or an ill-fitting suit. She was the convent girl and the teenage bride,
  the 60s It girl and the rock star’s girlfriend. She was the pop singer, the
  folk singer, the tragic addict and the indomitable survivor. Broken English, a
  flawed but ardent new documentary from Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard,
  effectively arranges all of these incarnations like museum exhibits and
  invites its subject to review each one in turn – and then smash the glass to
  set them free. Faithfull broke the mould, and so it is fitting that the film
  of her life should do the same, except that Forsyth and Pollard’s main conceit
  feels jerry-rigged and overdramatised to the point where it risks obscuring
  our view of the woman herself. We’re ostensibly inside “the Ministry of Not
  Forgetting”, an institution dedicated to examining truths and myths and the
  porous line between the two. It’s a defiantly analogue place, stuffed with
  tape decks and rotary phones, and presided over by Tilda Swinton in the role
  of a sharp-suited bureaucrat. Faithfull is the project and Swinton its
  exacting overseer. “We need to take a proper look at Marianne’s role as a
  destabilising influence,” she says by way of moving the action forward. Given
  her formidable reputation, one might imagine that Faithfull would have balked
  when confronted with this kind of art school posturing, but she seems game
  enough and graciously consents to be interviewed – very gently, it must be
  said – by the ministry’s record keeper, who is played by George MacKay. She’s
  relaxed and charismatic, happy to wander back across her past lives. But her
  health has been ravaged by emphysema and Covid and she’s vague on some details
  and unwilling to revisit some others, and has to occasionally pause to insert
  an oxygen tube. In this way, Broken English catches the legend’s last glow,
  just before the light went out for good. The ministry’s project purports to be
  a dispassionate investigation. In reality, it’s an appreciation, a
  reclamation, a film that lovingly toasts Faithfull’s fabulous, confounding
  career. She was the major’s daughter with the cut-glass accent who sang As
  Tears Go By and wrote the extraordinary Sister Morphine. But she was framed by
  the press as Mick Jagger’s muse, a good girl gone bad, and suffered through a
  decade of addiction before her galvanic reinvention. In the late 1970s she
  engineered a fresh role as a new wave powerhouse, the creator of the tour de
  force album from which this film takes its name. Faithfull was inconsistent
  and capricious, a self-confessed romantic, drawn to beauty and death. But she
  was also the casualty of a misogynistic culture that refused to acknowledge
  her as an artist and could barely contain its delight when she stumbled. The
  film-makers stumble a little themselves at this point by having Zawe Ashton
  and Sophia Di Martino crop up as an adoring Greek chorus, energetically
  fulminating on their idol’s behalf. But there’s no ignoring the impact of the
  archive montage in which a succession of sexist broadcasters excitably grill
  Faithfull about her celebrity lovers and debilitating drug use. “I was a kid,”
  she tells one as a way of explaining her missteps. “I didn’t grow up.” And
  while her later incarnation as the art scene’s weathered Mother Courage
  arguably risked replacing one cliche with another, here at last was one that
  she had scripted herself and could wholly lean into. Forsyth and Pollard were
  responsible for the fine Nick Cave documentary 20,000 Days on Earth back in
  2014. Cave makes a late appearance here as well, rolling into the ministry to
  assist on what would prove to be Faithfull’s final performance, filmed shortly
  before her death in January of this year. After all the fussy bells and
  whistles – the elaborate setup, the constraining conceit – it’s only right and
  proper that Faithfull should be allowed the last word. Appropriate, too, that
  she should go out with a song. • Broken English screened at the Venice film
  festival.
