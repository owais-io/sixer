  Some couples applying for a Santander mortgage will see the maximum they can
  borrow increase by £130,000 overnight after the bank loosened its lending
  rules. Santander is the latest in a line of lenders to allow some borrowers to
  access bigger mortgages after intervention by the City regulator and new
  guidelines from the Bank of England designed to help more people on to the
  housing ladder. However, brokers said Santander was unusual in that it would
  now be allowing some higher earners with smaller deposits to borrow an extra
  24% at a stroke. The bank gave the example of a couple with an £80,000 deposit
  or the same amount of equity in their property, where one earns £75,000 a year
  and the other £50,000. On Monday they could borrow a maximum of £556,500,
  assuming a standard mortgage and a 25-year term, but on Tuesday this will rise
  to £687,500. That is 24% more than before. Santander gave other examples where
  the extra amounts people would be able to borrow were smaller – 12% in one
  case, and 4% in another. In the last few months, many banks and building
  societies have announced changes to their rules. Some have loosened their
  “stress test” rules, which check that repayments will remain affordable even
  if mortgage rates go up, while others have increased their loan-to-income
  lending caps above the traditional 4.5:1 ratio. In March, the Financial
  Conduct Authority said the tests that some lenders were doing “may be unduly
  restricting access to otherwise affordable mortgages”. In July, the Bank of
  England issued guidelines that meant lenders could offer more high
  loan-to-income mortgages. Santander’s changes are a result of it updating its
  loan-to-income rules. The extra that people will be able to borrow will depend
  on how much they earn and the size of their deposit, or how much equity they
  have. The new rules mean applicants earning a total of £100,000 or more can
  now access 5.5 times their income on all loan-to-value (LTV) levels up to 90%.
  In other words, they will need a minimum deposit or equity of 10% of the
  home’s value to be eligible for those terms. Aaron Strutt, of the broker
  Trinity Financial, said: “Lots of the banks and building societies have made
  changes to their lending rules recently, but not many of them are offering to
  provide up to 24% more to borrowers with smaller deposits, even if they are
  higher earners.” David Morris, the head of homes at Santander UK, said 2025
  was “quickly becoming the ‘year of the buyer’”. The changes would “hopefully
  help more would-be buyers access the money they need to buy the home of their
  dreams,” he said.
