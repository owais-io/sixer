  The New Zealand air force has evacuated three people from a US research base
  in Antarctica in a high-risk operation that required navigating through
  extreme weather and round-the-clock darkness. The air force said on Wednesday
  the United National Science Foundation requested a medical evacuation for
  three of its staff members based at the McMurdo Station, one of whom needed
  urgent medical care. The crew of the C-130J Hercules flew on Tuesday
  afternoon, working through the night to complete the mission, the air force
  said. Between March to October, Antarctica is plunged into constant night and
  can experience dangerous storms. Temperatures at the McMurdo Station fell to
  -24C on Tuesday. Travel to the icy continent during this period is restricted
  to emergencies, with crews having to navigate extreme conditions, changing
  weather and landing on ice. Mid-winter flights to Antarctic are one of the
  most challenging operations the air force perform, said air commodore Andy
  Scott. The US team had to clear a runway and ensure the ice was “groomed and
  suitable for landing”, before the flight could depart New Zealand, Scott said.
  “Although they determine it is safe, it’s still an extremely challenging
  environment to fly in on night vision goggles due to the extreme weather
  conditions, which are highly changeable at this time of year and makes
  accurate forecasting a challenge,” he said. “This, coupled with there being no
  airfields available to divert to once the aircraft is past a certain point
  south adds to the risk, so these missions are not taken lightly.” Once on the
  ice, the plane’s engines are kept running to keep them warm while it is
  refuelled, known as “hot refuelling”. The Hercules flew to Antarctica with a
  doctor on board to care for the patients during the flight. The plane landed
  back in Christchurch on Wednesday morning, after a 19.5 hour round trip. In a
  statement, the US embassy expressed its “deep appreciation” to the air force.
  “This mission wasn’t just difficult; it was one of the most technically
  demanding operations an aircrew can face,” said Melissa Sweeney, the US chargé
  d’affaires in New Zealand. “This required absolute precision … This is the
  kind of mission that tests every ounce of skill and bravery,” Sweeney added.
