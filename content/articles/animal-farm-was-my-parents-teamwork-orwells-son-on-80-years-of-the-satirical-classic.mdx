  As the second world war reached its height, the winter of 1943-4 was one of
  the coldest of the century. My parents were living in a poorly heated flat in
  Kilburn, north-west London. My mother was working at the Ministry of Food. She
  was deeply involved in BBC Radio’s Kitchen Front which tried to help people
  conjure nutritious meals from their rations. My father became literary editor
  of Tribune magazine in November 1943. He was only required in the office three
  days a week, which gave him the time to write Animal Farm. Every evening, my
  father would read what he’d written to my mother under heavy blankets in bed.
  It was the only warm place in the flat. They would discuss the developing
  story and where it might go next. Lettice Cooper, the novelist and my mother’s
  Ministry of Food colleague, remembered my mother updating them every morning
  with the animals’ latest adventures. That my father and mother worked together
  so closely is no surprise. My father respected my mother’s talents greatly and
  later told a friend she had helped plan Animal Farm. Indeed, for some years,
  my mother had been typing and copy-editing my father’s writing and offering
  him detailed corrections and revisions. She was probably more deeply engaged
  with Animal Farm than with his previous work, perhaps even suggesting it
  should be a “beast fable” rather than the originally planned political
  polemic. The result of my parents’ teamwork, by the time Animal Farm was
  finished in February 1944, was one of the most beautifully written books of
  the century. On one level, Animal Farm is an ever-relevant satire of the
  Russian revolution and its betrayal into Stalinist autocracy. That was an evil
  my father and mother knew first hand. During the Spanish civil war they had
  witnessed the Stalinists slander, imprison, torture and murder dozens of their
  friends and comrades who did not slavishly follow the Soviet party line. They
  even had to flee Spain themselves under threat of Stalinist arrest and
  execution. Nothing dispels political illusions quicker than being pursued by
  fanatical murderers. These experiences, and the endless darkness of Stalin’s
  famines, gulags and purges, convinced my father that Soviet Russia was the
  very opposite of true socialism. He believed fervently that if democratic
  socialism was to flourish in the west, then the “myth” that Russia was a
  socialist state had to be debunked. But there were profound challenges that
  had to be overcome before Animal Farm could be published. There was a
  deep-rooted institutional reluctance to allow any criticism of Soviet Russia
  while it was a British ally leading the destruction of Nazi Germany. This
  attitude was compounded by relentless Soviet government lobbying and the
  comprehensive infiltration of British institutions by Soviet agents. Peter
  Smollett (AKA Smolka, Soviet agent codename ABO) was head of Soviet relations
  at the Ministry of Information and the now notorious Cambridge spy Guy Burgess
  was a BBC producer. Everywhere, negative stories about Russia were quietly
  downplayed or suppressed and positive ones megaphoned. In this climate, five
  major publishing houses (at least one of them advised by Smollett) turned down
  Animal Farm as an inappropriate attack on a vital wartime ally. Even Faber,
  following its director TS Eliot’s advice, doubted “that this is the right
  point of view from which to criticise the political situation at the present
  time”. Finally, in July 1944, Fredric Warburg of Secker &amp; Warburg, known
  for courageously publishing controversial leftwing books, agreed to take it
  on. Even then, paper shortages and possibly ongoing reluctance to offend
  Britain’s ally, meant Animal Farm was not published until 17 August 1945. When
  it finally appeared, my father was surprised at how little fuss there was
  about his bold satire of Stalinism and dictatorship. But relations with Russia
  were by then rapidly cooling and, as my father said, people were “fed up with
  all [this] Russian nonsense”. Animal Farm’s time had come. Since its first
  publication 80 years ago, it has sold more than 11m copies and never been out
  of print. But Animal Farm is more than just a satire of the Russian
  Revolution. This “fairy story” (as my father called it) is an eternal warning
  against political leaders who hijack potentially noble movements for their own
  selfish purposes. My father thought all politicians should be watched
  hawkishly, confronted truthfully (whatever the price) and kicked out when they
  put their interests before those of their country. Animal Farm has had a
  remarkable life story, playing its part in democratic protests behind the iron
  curtain and more recently in Myanmar, Zimbabwe and Ukraine. It remains an
  unforgettable inspiration to all those fighting for freedom. In a world where
  authoritarianism, nationalism, xenophobia and political lying are all on the
  rise, we need Animal Farm by our side more than ever now.
