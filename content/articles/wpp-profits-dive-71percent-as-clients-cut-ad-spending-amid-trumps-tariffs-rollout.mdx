  Clients including carmakers and consumer goods companies are cutting their
  advertising spending amid Donald Trump’s tariffs rollout, WPP has said as it
  reported a 71% slump in profits and a strategic review. The advertising
  agency, formerly the largest in the world, cut its global workforce from
  111,000 last year to 104,000 as of the end of June as it struggles with weak
  spending and the rise of artificial intelligence. WPP’s pre-tax profit dropped
  by 71% to £98m in the first half of its financial year. It has also halved its
  interim dividend to 7.5p a share before a strategic review that will be led by
  its incoming chief executive, Cindy Rose. She will take over from Mark Read on
  1 September. The company warned of slowing spending by ad agencies, which
  worsened between April and the end of June. “I have never seen a more volatile
  market,” Read told the Guardian. “I think a lot of clients are distracted by
  the macro, tariffs, figuring out what to do.” Read, who announced his
  departure in June, leaves WPP in a vulnerable state. Shares in the business
  have fallen by two-thirds during his tenure, and last year the company lost
  its crown as the biggest ad agency in the world by revenue as it has struggled
  to keep pace with its peers and compete with the growing use of AI-generated
  ad campaigns. He added that AI developments meant WPP could probably do its
  work with “fewer people”. “But at the same time, there will be more work in
  the future that AI will enable,” Read said. Rose, a top executive at
  Microsoft, has been on the board of WPP since 2019. At Microsoft she has been
  responsible for working with large clients to use digital technology and AI
  for business transformation. Investors hope her appointment will sharpen WPP’s
  focus on its AI capabilities. Read said it was “only natural” for a new chief
  executive to look at the strategy of the company. WPP has recently lost a
  series of significant client work, including Coca-Cola’s media business in
  North America, its two-decade relationship with the US media conglomerate
  Paramount and Mars’s $1.7bn (£1.25bn) global media planning and buying
  business. While WPP has increased its annual investment in AI to £300m, it
  faces intense competition from big tech companies such as the Facebook owner
  Meta, which has developed AI tools that allow advertisers to fully create and
  target campaigns on social media sites. These tools are expected to be rolled
  out by the end of next year. Last month WPP cut its forecast of revenues and
  profits for this year, blaming a challenging economic backdrop, which prompted
  the shares to drop by 19%. The stock fell by 4.5% in early trading on Thursday
  and is down by more than half in the year to date. Reuters contributed to this
  article.
