  Much like its namesake, Jesus Christ Superstar comes with a storied history.
  There have been at least four Broadway productions and many revivals, tours
  and adaptations of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1971 biblical rock
  musical. Just last month, the UK saw a revival met with acclaim. In Los
  Angeles’s version, not without “backlash”, Cynthia Erivo is the Holy Messiah.
  Jesus, clad in white cloth and cool white boots, faces betrayal at the hands
  of Judas (played by a magnetic Adam Lambert). In the first half of the show,
  as the apostles ask Jesus about his plans, and as lepers ask him to heal them,
  Erivo’s Jesus is restrained and she doesn’t quite make the role fully her own:
  Jesus is composed even in uncertainty, steady even when overwhelmed. But
  immediately into the second act, after Jesus realizes a disciple will betray
  him and as he pleads with God against the death that awaits him, Erivo lets
  despair take over in Gethsemane, stoking a tender touchpoint that makes Jesus
  feel human but commanding, helpless and then resolute. There is no doubt that
  you’re in the presence of a mastery of art form, of unbridled talent as Erivo
  sinks to her knees and resigns to God’s will – tears filling her eyes, the
  music simple and her crystalline voice carrying into the night. The outpour at
  first doesn’t feel quite earned but, on true skill and discipline, becomes
  moving and stunning to witness, enthralling the audience into a minute-long
  standing ovation. Judas, a juicier role that runs from rebellion to
  righteousness to sorrow, is a punk delight. Lambert is perfectly cast,
  harnessing a despair that’s mightily accessible throughout: he splits the
  difference between someone you’d meet at a bar who’s got some regrets and
  someone who was born at the gates of hell. In Damned for All Time / Blood
  Money, as Judas wrestles with whether or not to betray Jesus and tell
  Pharisees and priests where he is so that they can capture him, Lambert is a
  wavering flag, a lilt of evil. After Jesus is taken and Judas realizes the
  pain he’s wrought, Lambert offers in Judas’ Death a window into a sorrow we’ve
  all reached for before, a glimmer of hope that you’re not as bad as what
  you’ve just done. Hamilton’s Phillipa Soo, playing Mary Magdalene, brings a
  buttery voice and is a smart match to Erivo’s, and governor of Judea Pontius
  Pilate (Raúl Esparza), a commanding presence. But perhaps because of these
  heavyweights, other moments are more forgettable: the choreography (especially
  the apostles’) feels relatively simple and fades into the background, and the
  fanfare of King Herod (played by a last-minute John Stamos filling in for Josh
  Gad, who has Covid) in Herod’s Song could have offered a thicker moment of fun
  and delight, but Stamos is too much bravado over jeer. The set design for the
  most part leaves something to be desired, primarily a large screen hovering in
  the back; on it are graphics that aim to be camp but land more lazily –
  sometimes more literal camp with a mountain range of REI-type graphics,
  sometimes Vaporwave-like art you’d find at a Miami DJ set. But the holiness of
  the Hollywood Bowl venue is undeniable: as Jesus’s followers fawn and plead or
  when the orchestra softens with a solo nigh, a sense of devastation seeps in,
  the sky above the outdoor amphitheater a deep, navy hue, God’s Earth the
  stage. Despite the unevenness of Jesus’s conviction and some rushed ensemble
  songs, this rendition captures the tragedy of devotion and the contradictions
  of betrayal. “I don’t know how to love him,” sing Mary and Judas, in separate
  scenes – and still, you know they do.
