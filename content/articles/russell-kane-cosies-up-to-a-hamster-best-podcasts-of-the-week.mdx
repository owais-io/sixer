  Pick of the week Evil Animals With Russell Kane “Is this creature a
  misunderstood marvel or a furry little psychopath?” That’s what comedian
  Russell Kane is asking in this animal-themed spin-off series from his hit Evil
  Genius podcast. He’s starting (dangerously) small with the hamster. Helping
  him to decide whether they are “pet shop pin-ups or nugget-size narcissists”
  are fellow funny woman Laura Smyth and zoologist and hamster expert Jules
  Howard. Hollie Richardson Widely available, episodes weekly The Secret Life of
  Songs The second series of this impressive indie podcast sees musician Anthony
  T Jackson analyse the musical and cultural DNA of hits from the 70s and 80s.
  First up is Donna Summer’s gamechanging disco banger I Feel Love, produced by
  Giorgio Moroder and famously dubbed “the sound of the future” by Brian Eno.
  HJD Widely available, episodes weekly Do Not Disturb After 20 years as a
  flight attendant, Sherise Blackman made the leap to writing during the
  pandemic – and thank heavens she did. Her debut audio drama is both warm and
  risque, as a trio of Black British friends – voiced by Judi Love, Saffron
  Coomber and Blackman herself – navigate man troubles, health scares and queer
  love. Hannah J Davies Audible, all episodes out now Jacqueline Wilson Raised
  Us “Bog off!” Tracy Beaker actor Dani Harmer is the first guest to help
  celebrate the magical work of Jacqueline Wilson in this four-part podcast by
  Cosmopolitan. Wilson – whose books guided so many millennial teenagers – joins
  in and it is a nostalgic treat to hear them reminisce over bringing Beaker to
  life on screen. Hollie Richardson Widely available, episodes weekly Instant
  Classics Classicist Mary Beard and the Guardian’s chief culture writer
  Charlotte Higgins look at figures from the ancient world to find parallels
  with today’s political figures. The first question: which Roman emperor does
  Donald Trump most resemble? It’s more for those with a pre-existing passion
  for the classics, but we’re promised future topics with broader appeal. Alexi
  Duggins Widely available, episodes weekly
