  Almost five centuries ago a community of monks in the West Country of England
  gathered to sing, imploring their God to help them endure the challenges of
  medieval life. Thanks to an extraordinary discovery of music that survived
  Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century, the
  songs created by the Buckland Abbey monks were ringing out again across the
  hills and woods of the Tavy valley in Devon this weekend. The themes are heavy
  – the threats from disease and crop failures, not to mention powerful rulers –
  but the polyphonic style is bright and joyful, a contrast to the sort of
  mournful chants most associated with monks. “It’s an extraordinary rich,
  textured sound,” said Prof James Clark, a University of Exeter historian, as
  the university’s chapel choir rehearsed at Buckland. “They’re all singing
  together but following different melodies. It’s a sort of melodious cacophony
  of sound.” Clark found the music while researching Buckland Abbey for the
  National Trust. Only one book – rather boringly setting out the customs the
  monks followed – was known to exist, held in the British Library. “I didn’t
  hold out a great deal of hope it would suddenly open up the lost world of
  Buckland Abbey,” said Clark. But in the back of the Buckland Book, he came
  across some leaves of parchment. “Those leaves contained pieces of chant –
  text and notation. Though there were 800-plus monasteries in medieval England,
  you can count almost on one hand pieces of music that survived. “The Tudor
  state scrapped Latin worship and the lyrics and music that went with it were
  largely discarded. Most of this stuff is lost. But there it was, shoved into
  the back of the book.” The bulk of the book was written in the 15th century
  but Clark was able to date the music to the early 16th century. “That made it
  especially exciting because it transports us to that last generation of monks
  of the medieval English tradition that had been there for a millennium,” he
  said. It chimed with another Buckland document from the same era. “By
  extraordinary serendipity, it turned out to be the contract for the employment
  of an organist and choirmaster.” His name was Robert Derkeham, and he would
  have been hired to improve the singing of the dozen monks who lived at
  Buckland and the local boys brought in to sing the treble parts. Clark said it
  was clear that, as well as worshipping God, the monastery was trying to
  impress patrons by creating wonderful music. “Monasteries were competing in a
  very crowded marketplace for investment from patrons,” he said. “One of the
  strategies was to upgrade the music. Buckland bought in expertise to turn what
  may have been a rather ragged choir into something more professional. They
  were being responsive to cultural change, keeping up with the times and
  impress their audience.” Derkeham remained at the monastery for more than 15
  years, until it was closed and he was pensioned off. Clark said the text was
  dark. “It is calling out to what we might call an Old Testament God. One calls
  out to God to defend his people; one says, ‘stay the hand of the avenging
  angel’; one talks about being in despair. “I like that sense that it carries
  us back to a moment in time. In our world, medieval religion is becoming ever
  more difficult for us to grasp. I think this helps us return to an
  understanding that it was a sensory experience,” said Clark. “If we’re going
  to do these people who died 500 years ago some sort of justice as historians,
  we’ve got to understand the world as they saw it and as experienced it.” The
  book has been loaned to Buckland by the British Library and can be viewed at
  the abbey. The University of Exeter Chapel Choir will perform the music live
  in Buckland Abbey’s medieval Great Barn on 16 and 17 August.
