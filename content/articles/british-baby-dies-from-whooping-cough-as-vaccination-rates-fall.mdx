  A baby in the UK has died from whooping cough, marking the first such death in
  the country this year. The infant’s mother had not been vaccinated against the
  highly infectious disease, which affects the lungs and airways. This death
  occurred as vaccination rates among children and pregnant women in the UK have
  fallen to their lowest levels in 15 years. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can
  be fatal for babies, who are at the highest risk of severe illness or death.
  The child, thought to be under the age of one, was taken ill and died between
  March and June this year, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA),
  which is responsible for protecting the public from infectious diseases and
  other threats. It follows the death of a child from measles at Alder Hey
  children’s hospital in Liverpool last month and the deaths last year of 11
  children in England after an outbreak of whooping cough. Dr Gayatri
  Amirthalingam, the UKHSA deputy director, said: “Sadly, with a further infant
  death in the second quarter of 2025, we are again reminded how severe whooping
  cough can be for very young babies. Our thoughts and condolences are with the
  family who have so tragically lost their baby.” The agency warned last week
  that vaccination rates for primary schoolchildren were at the lowest levels
  for 15 years. Almost one in five children starting primary school this week in
  England are not fully protected from diseases including whooping cough, polio,
  tetanus and diphtheria. This puts the UK well below the World Health
  Organization’s 95% threshold for herd immunity for all childhood vaccines.
  Only 83.7% of five-year-olds have received both doses of the measles, mumps
  and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while uptake of the four-in-one preschool booster
  vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria
  – stood at 81.4% among five-year-olds in England. From next year, the NHS will
  begin vaccinating all babies against chickenpox, or varicella, by combining it
  with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in a new MMRV. Vaccine rates
  among pregnant women for whooping cough reached a peak of 76% in 2016 but fell
  to 59% by March last year. Since the deaths last year, vaccination rates among
  mothers recovered to 73%, but are still below the peak. “Ensuring women are
  vaccinated in pregnancy has never been more important,” Amirthalingam said.
  “Vaccination is the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that
  pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time,
  ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the
  womb so that they are protected from birth. “The recent increase in uptake of
  the whooping cough vaccine among pregnant women across the country shows that
  even more mothers are taking steps to protect their newborns. We want to
  ensure every expectant mother is offered the vaccine at the optimal time and
  understands that this vaccine is the best way to protect their baby during
  those crucial first weeks after birth. “If you are pregnant and approaching 20
  weeks, and haven’t been offered the whooping cough vaccine, please speak to
  your GP or midwife today to find out how you can get your vaccine.”
