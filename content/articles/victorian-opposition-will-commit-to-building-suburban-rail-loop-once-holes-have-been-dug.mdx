  The Victorian opposition has committed to proceeding with Labor’s signature
  infrastructure project, the Suburban Rail Loop, if elected to government next
  year and tunnelling has begun. The Coalition’s public transport spokesperson,
  Matthew Guy, who previously went to two elections vowing to scrap the $34.5bn
  project, told an ABC Radio forum on Tuesday there would be no choice but to go
  ahead with it come November 2026. “If the project has commenced and the
  tunnels are half constructed, well, we can’t fill them in. It will cost us
  more to stop a project than complete it,” Guy said. “So the project will then
  proceed, there’s no doubt about that. We’ll have to make sure that it’s
  managed appropriately – and unlike every other major project – managed on time
  and on budget, which would be rare.” Until now, the Coalition had committed to
  pausing the project and reassessing it if elected. Speaking later on Tuesday,
  opposition leader Brad Battin said he had an “identical” view to Guy on the
  issue but denied the party had changed its position. “The government have a
  responsibility right now. They could stop the project before December, before
  the holes have been dug. But should they not do that, and they dig two holes
  in the ground, the project will continue,” he said. However, Battin expressed
  doubt the tunnelling work would begin by then. “Let’s wait and see what
  happens when it comes to the boring machines, and if the government can get
  anything [done] on time,” he said. “But if there are two holes in the ground
  and the boring machines have started, we will go through the process and I
  guarantee you we will manage that project better.” The Labor minister
  overseeing the project, Harriet Shing, told the forum that tunnel boring
  machines would arrive in December. “They will be in the ground and doing their
  work next year,” she said. The Victorian government has committed about $9.3bn
  for the first stage of the loop, SRL East – a 26km stretch of tunnels between
  Cheltenham and Box Hill – while the Albanese government has pledged $2.2bn.
  The loop is eventually meant to connect Box Hill to Melbourne airport and then
  on to Werribee, though there has been no timeline or budget for this final
  stage. The project has been credited with helping Labor in the eastern
  electorates that are set to benefit first. But within the caucus, some Labor
  MPs have expressed concern about its cost and it beginning in the
  well-serviced east and not in the west, where there are several safe Labor
  seats but less transport infrastructure.
