  I respect the fact that David Renton has researched and written on the far
  right (Lessons from an asylum hotel counter-protest: calling our opponents
  ‘fascist’ doesn’t work, 29 August). However, I cannot agree with his argument
  that we should focus on the violence that a significant number of men involved
  in the protests, and riots following Southport last year have shown to women.
  I think this would be like a red rag to a bull to the many protesters not
  involved in crimes of domestic violence. They would simply call it out as a
  lefty slur against all men protesting against immigration. This is, therefore,
  no more of a nuanced argument than calling people Nazis and fascists. Calling
  men out as wife-beaters simply won’t cut it. Having said that, I believe
  Renton is also wrong on Tommy Robinson. He may not reference Hitler’s Mein
  Kampf, but deliberately targets single Muslim men, a fact Renton acknowledges.
  Robinson is an Islamophobe. If we can’t get that blatant fact out there as our
  argument, then I’m afraid we are, as they say, screwed. Desmond Hewitt
  Marlborough, Wiltshire • The charge of fascist has been used far too loosely
  in response to official behaviour for decades, and, unless people have studied
  modern history, there’s a good chance that it means nothing to them. But
  “racist” is clear, unambiguous, and justified. There’s too much talk of
  “legitimate concerns”, enabling racists to claim that they are acting for
  their communities. Racism must be called out and confronted, or otherwise it
  will become the dominant, respectable route to government in our democracy.
  Rod Penny Poole, Dorset • I admire David Renton’s optimism about how to combat
  those protesting outside hotels, but, as shown with Brexit, Trump (twice) and
  many public policies, you can’t fight feelings with facts. Richard Wetherell
  London • Surely one way to disarm the “jelly-bellied flag-flappers” (Rudyard
  Kipling) would be for counter-demonstrators to put aside all distaste and
  themselves turn up en masse bearing St George’s flags. Paul Roper Bridport,
  Dorset • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please
