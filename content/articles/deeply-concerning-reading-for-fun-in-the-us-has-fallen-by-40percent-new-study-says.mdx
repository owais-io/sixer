  The number of Americans who read for pleasure has fallen by 40%, according to
  a new study. Researchers at the University of Florida and University College
  London have found that between 2003 and 2023, daily reading for reasons other
  than work and study fell by about 3% each year. The number saw a peak in 2004,
  with 28% of people qualifying, before falling to 16% in 2023. The data was
  taken from more than 236,000 Americans who participated in the American Time
  Use Survey and the study was published in the journal iScience. The definition
  of reading in the survey wasn’t limited to books; it also included magazines
  and newspapers in print, electronic or audio form. Jill Sonke, study
  co-author, called it “a sustained, steady decline” and one that is “deeply
  concerning”. “Reading has historically been a low-barrier, high-impact way to
  engage creatively and improve quality of life,” Sonke said. “When we lose one
  of the simplest tools in our public health toolkit, it’s a serious loss.”
  While all groups saw a decline, there were bigger drops among certain groups
  such as Black Americans, people with lower incomes or education levels, and
  those in rural areas. More women than men also continue to read for fun. Daisy
  Fancourt, study co-author, said: “Potentially the people who could benefit the
  most for their health – so people from disadvantaged groups – are actually
  benefiting the least.” The study also showed that those who read for pleasure
  have tended to spend even more time reading than before and that the number of
  those who read with their children hasn’t changed. “Our digital culture is
  certainly part of the story,” Sonke said of explanations to the figures. “But
  there are also structural issues – limited access to reading materials,
  economic insecurity and a national decline in leisure time. If you’re working
  multiple jobs or dealing with transportation barriers in a rural area, a trip
  to the library may just not be feasible.” Last year in the US, sales of
  physical books rose slightly after two years of declines. Adult fiction was
  the main driver, with Kristin Hannah’s The Women leading the pack. The
  literacy level in the US is estimated to be about 79%, which ranks as 36th
  globally.
