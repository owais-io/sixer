  The Lionesses are simply the most successful England football team in history,
  winning back-to-back European Championships and becoming the first England
  senior team to win a major tournament on foreign soil. It is an incredible
  achievement and one that will reverberate through the women’s game for many
  years to come. The head coach, Sarina Wiegman, is simply world class; it’s an
  overused phrase but absolutely fitting in this case. To reach five major
  finals in a row (including a European Championship win and a World Cup final
  with the Netherlands before joining England) is a record that may never be
  surpassed. She was an inspired choice by Kay Cossington, the former Football
  Association technical director who targeted her for her ability to build a
  strong culture and sense of team as much as her obvious tactical acumen. The
  Lionesses, like their manager, also demonstrate exemplary leadership qualities
  on and off the pitch. On the pitch, they are wonderfully resilient and
  determined and simply do not know how to give up. In the semi-final, as even
  the most ardent England fan was losing hope, they found a way in the 96th
  minute to claw themselves back into the competition. They had to come from
  behind three times in the competition and emerged victorious from two penalty
  shootouts (how very un‑English) to retain their trophy. Off the pitch, they
  are visible and vocal ambassadors for the game, demanding equal access for
  girls to play and ensuring that when the baton is passed on to the next
  generation the game is left in a better place. They utilised their platform to
  speak out on a range of issues from periods to autism, mental health and
  bereavement and also took a stand against the abhorrent racism directed at
  Jess Carter. The Lionesses are the powerful role models our young girls so
  desperately need. While the England men’s team, under Gareth Southgate’s
  leadership, embodied a more inclusive vision of Englishness (captured
  beautifully in Dear England) the Lionesses have embodied a strong powerful
  sense of a modern young woman. So, congratulations Sarina and the Lionesses, I
  couldn’t be a more proud English woman. But, with the players now on a
  well-deserved break, attention will soon turn to the launch of the Women’s
  Super League season and the need to maximise the momentum from the summer. The
  Lionesses captured the imagination of the nation. TV audiences peaked at 16
  million for the final, the biggest audience of the year and something that
  would have seemed unimaginable not so long ago. More than 65,000 fans came to
  London last Tuesday, in unprecedented scenes for women’s sport, to
  congratulate their heroines and celebrate their achievements. Even the most
  ardent naysayers have to admit – women’s football has a passionate and growing
  fanbase. And it is this very fanbase that presents football with its biggest
  growth opportunity. A recent Nielsen report estimated that women’s football
  fans worldwide will reach 800 million by 2030. The women’s football fanbase is
  young, diverse, female skewed and passionate about the women’s game, its
  values, its inclusiveness and its accessibility. Clubs’ marketing and PR
  strategies need to reflect this and understand that the way the women’s game
  is consumed is different from the men’s game. Targeting this fanbase in this
  way will bring clubs new fans through the turnstiles, new brands and new
  revenues. Now who couldn’t get behind that opportunity? The challenge for WSL
  Football (the new company overseeing women’s professional football), working
  tirelessly to grow the game, is the varying levels of commitment, expertise
  and investment from the clubs to do just this. Arsenal offer proof that
  investing in a great product, marketing it to this new fanbase and providing a
  great match day experience can create a viable women’s football team. They
  have already sold 15,000 season tickets and, come the opening fixture, the
  Emirates Stadium will be sold out with Gooners welcoming back both their
  Lionesses and their Champions League‑winning heroines. But many clubs are just
  scratching the surface, focused on the behemoth that is men’s football. And I
  do understand. If you are responsible for a global brand where the majority of
  revenue comes from the men’s game, this will be your main focus, but
  forward-thinking leaders of clubs cannot miss this new growth opportunity. A
  modern progressive club, attracting purpose-driven brands and engaging the
  next generation of young fans will need a thriving men’s and women’s team. The
  younger generation expect better. And if you can’t or won’t invest in it there
  are plenty who will. Women’s football is becoming fertile ground for investors
  and private equity as club audiences, revenues and valuations grow
  exponentially. Michele Kang’s purchase of London City Lionesses and Alexis
  Ohanian’s 10% investment in Chelsea is only the tip of the iceberg. These
  investors bring in much needed revenue to bolster the first team as well as a
  start-up mindset with the capability and focus to drive commercial growth. The
  worst thing that clubs can do now is nothing, whether that’s not selling a
  stake to attract the expertise and investment required or not investing
  themselves. Put bluntly, it’s time to put up or sell out. Women’s football, in
  my lifetime, will become the second biggest sport in the world behind men’s
  football. If you cannot see this after Euro 2025, then you need to take the
  blinkers off. It’s time to step up and invest. The Lionesses’ legacy depends
  on you. Kelly Simmons is a consultant for Run Communications’ women’s sport
  division, Run X, and former director of the women’s professional game at the
