  An economist with a strong grasp of politics, Meghnad Desai, who has died aged
  85, put telling the truth ahead of the pursuit of personal ambition. His work
  as professor at the London School of Economics had the wide perspective that
  came from his Indian heritage, and his interest in Labour politics led to him
  becoming an active member of the House of Lords. The first of his books,
  Marxian Economic Theory, was published in 1973. I was one of his many students
  who benefited from the use of his book Applied Econometrics (1976). Testing
  Monetarism (1981) predicted the demise of the money-supply targeting that was
  then being pursued by Margaret Thatcher’s government. Marx’s Revenge: The
  Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism (2002) contains
  perhaps his best-known contribution to the discipline. He asserted that Karl
  Marx had been misunderstood: he never said that capitalism was going to
  collapse anytime soon. On Meghnad’s reading, Marx expected capitalism to
  continue until it had exhausted its productive potential, which given
  globalisation, could take a very long time. Appointed to the Lords by Neil
  Kinnock in 1991, he became a frontbench economics spokesman, but was sacked
  three years later by John Smith when a theoretical speculation of his ran
  counter to Labour’s need for a presentable tax policy. Meghnad backed a
  proposal to widen the scope of the VAT net to include food and children’s
  clothing. This view was subsequently supported in 2010 by Sir James Mirrlees’
  review for the Institute for Fiscal Studies as to how a more rational tax
  system could operate, but it was not a political headline that Labour was
  looking for in 1994. More presciently, he pointed out in early August 2022
  that if Liz Truss were elected as Conservative leader and so the new prime
  minister, which she was a month later, then she would crash the pound. On the
  international stage, Meghnad championed a move away from a narrow focus on
  material progress in measuring development, and proposed instead a human
  development index. This found its way into the human development reports
  produced by the UN. With particular regard to India, Meghnad was an early
  proponent of, and an optimist about, the market-based reforms that were first
  introduced in 1991 and were to mark a turning point for Indian economic
  growth. In a tribute at the time of his deah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi
  called him a “distinguished thinker and reformer”. His later writings included
  Nehru’s Hero: Dilip Kumar in the Life of India (2004), on the film star who
  brought method acting to Indian cinema; Rethinking Islamism: The Ideology of
  the New Terror (2006), distinguishing between the religion and the militant
  mindset; and The Rediscovery of India (2011), covering the last 500 years of
  the region’s history. He turned his hand to fiction too, with Dead on Time
  (2009), featuring a British prime minister, and an autobiography, Rebellious
  Lord (2020). He published more than 200 articles in academic journals and
  books, and was co-editor of the Journal of Applied Econometrics from 1984 to
  1991. In British political life, he was chairman of the Islington South and
  Finsbury Labour party between 1986 and 1992; the constituency’s MP was Chris
  Smith. When in 2020 Meghnad felt that the Labour party had not done enough to
  counter antisemitism, he became a non-affliated peer, and then, in 2023, a
  crossbencher. Born in what is now Varodara, in Gujarat state, Meghnad was the
  son of Mandakini and Jagdhishchandra Desai, a civil servant. He started
  secondary school at the age of seven and matriculated at 14. Then he was
  educated at the University of Bombay and subsequently won a scholarship to
  attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained his PhD at the age of
  23 under the supervision of the Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein. After a short
  spell at the University of California, Berkeley, he arrived as a lecturer at
  the LSE in 1965, becoming professor in 1983 and emeritus in 2003, and
  president of the Association of University Teachers in Economics (1987-90). At
  the LSE he was head of the Development Studies Institute (1990-95), and
  founded and headed the Centre for the Study of Global Governance (1992-2003).
  In 1970, he married Gail Wilson, a lecturer at the LSE. They had three
  children, Tanvi, Nuala and Sven. The editor of his book on Dilip Kumar was
  Kishwar Ahluwalia. After his first marriage ended in divorce, he married
  Kishwar in 2004, and his family then expanded to include her three children,
  Gaurav, Mallika and Priyanka. In 2008, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the
  third highest civilian honour awarded by India. Six years later, Meghnad
  founded the Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust, and as chair of the trustees, he
  raised money and worked with the UK government to help erect the statue in
  Parliament Square in 2015. He also supported Kishwar in her role as chair of
  the Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust, the NGO responsible for creating and
  running the Partition Museum, which opened in Amritsar in 2017. Meghnad’s
  kindness and generosity were evident when the economics internship I had been
  offered at a government department in 1979 fell victim to spending cuts by the
  incoming Thatcher government. He quickly found money to offer me a research
  assistant post, and encouraged many people early in their careers. His
  open-mindedness showed in his insistence, when I was an undergraduate, that I
  read widely, including John Rawls, the advocate of “justice as fairness”. He
  is survived by Kishwar, his children and four grandchildren, Om, Ira, Chloe
  and Kiko. • Meghnad Jagdishchandra Desai, Lord Desai, economist, born 10 July
  1940; died 29 July 2025
