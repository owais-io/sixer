  Your new film The Ballad Of Wallis Island scores an impressive 96% on Rotten
  Tomatoes. Who would you most like to hurl 96 rotten tomatoes at? Do I have to
  hurl them at the same person, or can I split them? Can they be living or dead?
  Let’s take 40 to hurl at Hitler. I wouldn’t mind keeping 10 back just in case
  I need to hurl them at a random person. That leaves 46. How rotten are they?
  Maybe I’ll eat 10, which leaves 36. Is there anyone I can help you with?
  Plenty. Although we’re on Zoom, so I’d need my rotten tomatoes to be virtual.
  Well, I’m your man. I can go round if you like. Else I think I’ve done
  everything I need to. The other 36 go down the garbage chute, I’m afraid. In
  Peep Show, your character was thrown in a lift in your sleeping bag and
  water-boarded by Mark, Jez and Super Hans. Have you ever been rudely evicted
  in real life? I was rudely evicted in Edinburgh about four years ago, where I
  am now. They threw me out and my stuff was gone thank to some scandalous
  landlords. I think I managed to grab one bag of stuff, but when I went back to
  get the rest, it was gone. Definitely lost in that transaction was a very nice
  radio. The writing on the wall really was when I arrived and they had a toilet
  roll holder in the lounge. I don’t know what was going on in that place. You
  never know quite where you’re going to get with Edinburgh accommodation. I’m
  here now. Who last addressed you as “Timothy?” A nurse on Tuesday. What’s the
  shortest poem you’ve ever written? “Tanya Googled herself. Still nothing.”
  You’re also about to star in follow-up to the US version of The Office, The
  Paper, which follows the staff at a small-town American newspaper. What would
  you do if you were editor of the Guardian for the day? I don’t really read
  newspapers. I just buy them to do the crossword. I think I’d probably make the
  Guardian bigger again, because it’s small now. I’d make it an unwieldy,
  difficult thing to read, and put the cryptic crossword on the back page. The
  sports section currently is wrapped up in the culture section. I’d free that,
  because that’s the only bit that I really read. You also play Sidekick Simon
  to Alan Partridge. What does Steve Coogan smell like? I imagine Partridge
  smells lightly of Brut aftershave. Coogan: a more high-end aftershave. What’s
  been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? I guess it’s when you
  fanboy someone, isn’t it? I’ve since met Mike Atherton, the [former] England
  cricket captain, and he was lovely. But I was at a book signing in Cheltenham
  and – you tell me if this is cringeworthy – my friend and I followed him at
  safe distance to a pub and then sat at a safe distance on a different table. I
  think it’s really cringeworthy because you get people who pluck up the courage
  to say: “I think you’re fantastic.” But I didn’t even have that courage. I
  just sort of sat nearby. I wasn’t even close enough to tell you what
  aftershave he was wearing. Please explain the virtues of the humble fig roll,
  a biscuit you have famously been pictured eating in the past. It’s a fantastic
  biscuit. The best part is that you can kid yourself into thinking it’s healthy
  because it does have fruit in it. So the optics are good. It is not a dark
  chocolate McVitie’s digestive situation which you clearly know is bad for you
  because of the chocolate. Also, it’s a very nice hard biscuit. There’s some
  crunch to it, but it’s very good for dipping in coffee. It softens very
  quickly and I would say is certainly in my top three biscuits at this stage.
  McVitie’s have recently come out and said you should be eating your digestives
  chocolate-side down. I can see the benefits in eating them upside down. The
  tongue tastes more of the chocolate and the chocolate doesn’t coat the roof of
  the mouth. Is that the idea? I just don’t think that’s something I can get
  entirely on board with, unfortunately, so I don’t think I’ll be doing that.
  When did you last cry? I last cried watching a play about Bill Shankly, the
  former Liverpool manager. It was a beautiful production in Liverpool with a
  community choir on stage, very emotional, and the perfect play. I cried more
  or less throughout, amazingly. Would you rather die at the bottom of the ocean
  or deep out into space? I think both are pretty lonely, but space is more
  spectacular, isn’t it? Puts you on the map. It would be a decent death element
  to my Wikipedia page. The Ballad of Wallis Island is out in Australian cinemas
  from 28 August. Tim Key is performing Loganberry at Pleasance Courtyard and
  Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 August, then at Wilton’s Music Hall,
  London, 10-22 November
