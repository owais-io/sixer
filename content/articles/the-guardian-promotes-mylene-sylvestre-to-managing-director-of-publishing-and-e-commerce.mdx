  Guardian Media Group today (Tuesday 2 September) has announced that Mylene
  Sylvestre has been promoted to managing director of publishing and e-commerce.
  This new move is part of the Guardian’s commercial strategy to innovate and
  diversify its product portfolio. As audiences evolve, the Guardian is
  increasingly tapping into its print and digital products to create greater
  value for its readers across both channels. In her expanded role, Sylvestre
  will take on commercial responsibility for the Filter, the Guardian’s
  independent product reviews guide, collaborating with editorial teams
  globally. She will continue to lead on print publishing, including the
  development of new digital formats. Sylvestre has been at the Guardian for
  almost three decades, driving many major commercial print and publishing
  milestones - from the move to the tabloid format, the transformation of
  Guardian Weekly into an award-winning magazine, to the successful relaunch of
  the Guardian’s Saturday print package. In her previous role, as director of
  publishing she reshaped the department, to secure long-term commercial
  sustainability of the Guardian’s print products protecting vital revenues.
  Beyond publishing, Sylvestre is a committed advocate for inclusivity in
  leadership in media. She is a trustee of two industry non-profits - ACE and
  Newstraid, and co-founder of the Women of Colour Global Network (WOCGN), a
  cross-industry organisation supporting professional women of colour at every
  stage of their careers. In her new role, Sylvestre will report directly to
  chief supporter officer Liz Wynn. Liz Wynn, chief supporter officer, Guardian
  Media Group, says: “As our audience needs continue to evolve, we see
  increasing opportunities for the Guardian’s print and digital products to
  mutually reinforce each other. Mylene has been instrumental in shaping the
  Guardian’s publishing success over many years and this new role is a natural
  next step. Her experience, creativity and commitment to innovation will be
  invaluable as we continue to diversify our product portfolio and grow new
  areas of the business.” Mylene Sylvestre, says: “This is an exciting moment
  for our print and digital reader revenue teams, as we join forces to
  accelerate the Guardian’s growth strategy. Through combining our publishing
  expertise, with close editorial collaboration, we have a real opportunity to
  expand our product offering on a much larger scale. We are diversifying into
  new areas, such as our affiliates business, while ensuring we continue serving
  our readers in fresh and meaningful ways. I’m delighted to join Liz’s team to
  support her vision and see it come to fruition over the next few years.”
