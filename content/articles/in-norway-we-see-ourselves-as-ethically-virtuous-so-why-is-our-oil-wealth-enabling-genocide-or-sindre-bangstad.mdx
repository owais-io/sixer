  Oil has made Norway extremely rich. We have the world’s largest sovereign
  wealth fund, which was established with petroleum revenues in 1990. Headed by
  the wealthy banker and art investor Nicolai Tangen, the Government Pension
  Fund Global (GPFG), has a current value of more than 20 239bn Norwegian kroner
  (£1.4tr). With holdings in about 8,500 companies in 69 different countries, it
  is the largest single investor in the world. Norway also purports to have a
  human-rights-based foreign policy, and the sovereign wealth fund is supposed
  to adhere to a set of ethical guidelines. Companies may be excluded if there
  is a risk that they contribute to or are responsible for serious human rights
  violations, or are involved in the sale of weapons to states that violate
  international law in armed conflicts. A Council on Ethics makes
  recommendations about exclusions from the GPFG’s investment portfolio, but
  only after the fact. Since 2024, the government has repeatedly cautioned
  Norwegian business not to invest in companies that support Israeli occupation
  policies or human rights violations. But it seems to have had few problems
  with the fact that the sovereign wealth fund has investments totalling 22.7bn
  Norwegian kroner (£1.6bn) in 65 Israeli companies. Since the Hamas atrocities
  of 7 October 2023 and Israel’s subsequent retaliation in Gaza, the oil fund
  has actually increased its investments in Israel by 66%. These are managed by
  three Israeli investment companies, one of which has clear links to Israeli
  cabinet ministers. In April this year, the UN’s special rapporteur Francesca
  Albanese warned that Norway’s sovereign wealth fund had investments in Israeli
  arms companies and was a “major European source of investment for Israel’s
  ongoing occupation”. She warned of the risks of complicity with violations of
  international law. The Norwegian minister of finance, Jens Stoltenberg (a
  former Nato secretary general), rebuffed Albanese, but many Norwegian NGOs
  stepped up the pressure. In June, a 118-page report from Historians for
  Palestine – based on research that could easily have been done by the oil
  fund’s ethics council – revealed Norwegian state investments in Israeli
  companies believed to be involved in the genocide in Gaza. The report was sent
  to the Ministry of Finance but gained little traction. Then, as Norwegians
  began taking their summer holidays, another news site documented investments
  by the wealth fund in Israeli companies, including Bet Shemesh Engines, which
  provides maintenance and supplies parts for the Israeli air force’s F-15, F-16
  and Apache helicopters, which have terrorised Gaza’s civilian population; and
  Next Vision Stabilized Systems, which produces cameras for drones used by the
  Israeli army in Gaza. A none too subtle clue about Bet Shemesh’s activities
  may be gathered from the company’s own website, which declares that it is
  “particularly proud to support IAF’s frontline fighter aircraft and
  helicopters”. At a time when the number of Palestinians killed by the IDF had
  already exceeded 20,000, and legal scholars increasingly began referring to
  Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide, the GFPF increased its shares in Bet
  Shemesh, whose share market value had skyrocketed. Opposition parties on the
  left in Norway have long demanded that the oil fund’s investments in Israel
  should be pulled completely. But as recently as June, a parliamentary majority
  voted down that proposal. One of the stock responses to critics of investing
  in Israeli companies is that there should not be any “political interference”
  with investment decisions. Yet four days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine
  in 2022, the Ministry of Finance instructed that the GPFG divest from Russia.
  It was not until the liberal-conservative Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten this
  month published the news of the GPFG’s investments in Bet Shemesh that this
  turned into a full-blown political scandal. Stoltenberg at that point demanded
  a full review of the fund’s investments in Israeli companies. The government
  has now announced that the GPFG will divest from 17 Israeli companies,
  including Bet Shemesh Engines, and that the fund’s Israel investments will no
  longer be managed by Israeli investment companies. The prime minister, Jonas
  Gahr Støre, has however ruled out the total divestment from Israel that
  opposition parties on the left have called for. But media disclosures about
  the GPFG’s investments keep coming. The latest relate to fund stakes in two
  Israeli banks whose loans have played a key role in Elbit, Israel’s largest
  private arms manufacturer. Elbit was the first Israeli company the GPFG
  divested from, in 2009, citing its involvement in violations of international
  law. “Nordic exceptionalism” comes naturally to Norwegians: we like to think
  of ourselves as a beacon in a dark world, leading the way in Europe on ethics
  and virtue. Norway formally recognised the state of Palestine in 2024 (which
  the Israeli far-right government described as an act that rewarded terrorism).
  But the scandal over the sovereign wealth fund is testing both that self-image
  and the political consensus about our ethical and human-rights-based foreign
  policy. Most Norwegians say they want our sovereign wealth fund’s investments
  out of Israel, surveys indicate. But with the country heading for a general
  election on 8 September, the issue of collectively profiting from investments
  in companies that supply the perpetrators of genocide in Gaza is converting a
  moral dilemma into a political turning point. Voters face a choice between a
  centre-left government committed to building national wealth via investments
  in Israel; a rightwing party (and the main opposition) that wants to ignore
  the ongoing genocide in Gaza and increase trade with Israel; and the leftwing
  calling for total divestment from Israel. So far, polls indicate that foreign
  policy is higher up the agenda for voters than ever before. If this is
  accurate, the governing Labour party may be severely punished for its stance.
  This could open the door to a government which would be even worse on the
  issue of Palestine. But if an ethical foreign policy means anything, then Gaza
  must be a defining issue for Norway, a mirror for Norwegians too. Sindre
