  I’m not sure I’ve ever bought a bag of oven chips. My mum bought them in the
  1980s and 90s, but they were never nice, and sometimes resembled cardboard.
  I’ve always assumed they were among the most processed foods on the planet, so
  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste and even health scores of the
  brands tested here, which I assessed using the Yuka app. Most are low in salt,
  sugar and saturated fat, and had relatively simple recipe formulas. While a
  few brands included concerning ingredients – such as disodium diphosphate and
  artificial flavourings – most use a blend of sunflower and rapeseed oil, with
  no hazardous additives. However, nearly all contained a small amount of
  dextrose, a sugar that feels unnecessary here, not least because potatoes
  already have a natural sweetness. Just two brands were dextrose-free, earning
  them an extra point. To improve crunch and texture, many brands coat their
  chips in a mix of flours and starches, typically wheat, rice, maize or pea
  flour, and sometimes with raising agents. Though not essential, these coatings
  contribute to golden, crisp exteriors that, when done well, enhance the chip;
  done badly, however, they bring a slightly processed edge. Overall, the
  results of this test were genuinely impressive, so much so, in fact, that I’m
  now planning to develop my own version of oven chips at home. There wasn’t
  much to go on regarding sustainability, although I awarded a point where
  products disclosed the variety and origin of the potatoes used. Some
  highlighted their use of maris pipers – a classic chip variety prized for its
  high starch and low moisture content, creating that ideal fluffy interior and
  crunchy exterior. Every bag I tested was packaged in LDPE 4 plastic or
  similar, which is recyclable only in-store, so a missed opportunity for more
  accessible recycling. *** The best oven chips *** Best all-rounder: Morrisons
  the Best triple-cooked skin-on chips £2.85 for 750g at Morrisons (38p/100g)
  ★★★★★ Rich, savoury flavour with a crisp, golden, skin-on exterior and fluffy
  interior. Excellent texture and thick cut. Coated in maize, rice, pea flour
  and dextrose. Made with British potatoes. Gluten-free. Remarkable value. ***
  Best bargain: Tesco home-style straight-cut oven chips £2.65 for 950g at Tesco
  (28p/100g) ★★★☆☆ Golden brown and very long, which is quite fun. A chewy yet
  crunchy exterior and sweet, earthy flavour with hints of baked potato. British
  potatoes coated in rice and maize flour with modified starches. Gluten-free
  and outstanding value. *** And the rest: Waitrose No 1 frozen triple-cooked
  chips £3.25 for 750g at Waitrose (43p/100g) ★★★★☆ A perfectly even, golden
  exterior and lovely, chunky shape. Really tasty, with rich, umami-laden notes
  from the beef fat. The coating includes potato, maize starch, and rice and pea
  flours, but it’s well-executed and contributes to a satisfying crunch.
  Gluten-free. Pricey, but still reasonable value. *** Strong Roots proper chips
  £3.75 for 750g at Ocado (50p/100g) ★★★★☆ Skin-on and beautifully browned with
  a chunky cut. Fluffy and delicious with a clean, simple flavour because of the
  refreshingly short ingredients list – these are just maris piper potatoes and
  sunflower oil, so they are gluten- and dextrose-free. The only chip to earn an
  extra sustainability point due to Strong Roots’ B Corp status. More expensive
  than many others, but fair value given the ethical credentials. *** Koffmann’s
  classic chunky chips £3.50 for 800g at Ocado (44p/100g) ★★★★☆ Fresh-tasting,
  homemade feel and a clean flavour. Smooth, creamy interior with a crisp,
  skin-on exterior and chunky round cut. Coated with rice flour, potato starch,
  dextrin and turmeric. Gluten-free, though no provenance details. *** McCain
  naked oven chips straight cut £1.98 for 900g at Asda (22p/100g) £2 for 900g at
  Sainsbury’s (22p/100g) ★★★☆☆ A nostalgic 1980s-style oven chip with decent
  crunch, though the interior was moist and smooth, rather than fluffy.
  Remarkable to see just two ingredients (potatoes and oil), not least because
  at this price point processed foods often have more complex formulas.
  Gluten-free and dextrose-free, too. Incredible for the money. *** Birds Eye
  crispy chips £2.48 for 900g at Asda (28p/100g) £2.50 for 900g at Tesco
  (28p/100g) ★★★☆☆ Golden, thanks to the addition of turmeric and pepper
  extract. A moreish, savoury-sweet flavour with enjoyable crunch (because of
  the bicarb, potato starch and rice flour coating). Closer to a french fry than
  a classic chip. Contains disodium diphosphate, a phosphate additive that some
  may wish to avoid. Gluten-free. *** M&amp;S home-style chips £2.80 for 1kg at
  Ocado (28p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Classic golden chip shop-style chip with a clean,
  vegetal flavour, crunchy coating and moist centre. British potatoes coated in
  wheat, corn and rice flour batter. Not my favourite, but excellent value and
  one of the rare dextrose-free products. *** Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference
  chunky chips £3.50 for 1.2kg at Sainsbury’s (29p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Thick-cut and
  well-browned with a soft, slightly oily interior. Sweet but not especially
  flavourful. Dusted with flours for added crunch. One of the only products
  detailing origin and potato variety (these are made with British maris
  pipers). Good value but not as tasty as I’d expected. Contain gluten, too. ***
  Aunt Bessie’s crispy skin-on home-style chips £3.40 for 800g at Ocado
  (43p/100g) £3.90 for 800g at Sainsbury’s (49p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Beautiful colour and
  long cut with a welcome crunchy and fluffy texture. However, the flavour feels
  a little artificial and less natural than many of the others, and these
  contain artificial flavourings, too, so with superior products at lower
  prices, I’d shop elsewhere. Gluten-free.
