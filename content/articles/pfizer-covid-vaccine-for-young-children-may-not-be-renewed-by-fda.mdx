  Pfizer’s Covid vaccine for young children may not be renewed by the US Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA) this fall, prompting Moderna to fill possible
  gaps in supply, according to an email obtained by the Guardian. The move would
  pull the only remaining Covid vaccine for all children under five from the
  market. The Moderna vaccine is only approved for children with one or more
  health conditions, and the pediatric Covid vaccine from Novavax is only
  available for children aged 12 and up with health conditions. “It certainly
  would create a hole in the availability of vaccines,” said Georges Benjamin,
  the executive director of the American Public Health Association. “And to do
  it this late in the season – I think clearly it’s inappropriate.” According to
  an email from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases
  (NCIRD), Pfizer said the FDA recently informed the pharmaceutical company that
  it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its pediatric Covid
  vaccine for the 2025 respiratory season. The email was sent on Friday to state
  and local vaccination grantees. The Pfizer vaccine is given to children
  between the ages of six months and four years. Pfizer expects its Covid
  vaccine for children aged five to 11 to be fully licensed this fall, the email
  said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is “in discussions”
  with Moderna about rapidly increasing its Covid vaccine supply for young
  children, according to the email. That includes internal planning about
  volume, timing and potential supply gaps. “We are working to ensure there will
  be sufficient supply,” said Chris Ridley, a Moderna spokesperson. Pfizer did
  not respond to media inquiries by publication time. On Monday, communications
  director for the US Department for Health and Human Services (HHS), Andrew
  Nixon, told the Guardian: “The Covid-19 pandemic ended with the expiration of
  the federal public health emergency in May 2023. We do not comment on
  potential, future regulatory changes. Unless officially announced by HHS,
  discussion about future agency action should be regarded as pure speculation.”
  In July, Moderna received FDA approval of its Covid pediatric shot. But the
  vaccine was only approved for children with one or more health conditions that
  make them more vulnerable to Covid. This move could limit access to Covid
  vaccines. “We already have a low number of people using the vaccines to start
  with,” Benjamin said. “There hasn’t been enough promotion of vaccinations for
  kids, and then you have Mr [Robert F] Kennedy’s [Jr] unscientific statements
  about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, particularly Covid vaccines, for
  both pregnant women and kids. It has muddied the waters of what people know
  about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.” The vaccine is extremely
  effective, especially against hospitalization and death. Yet only 5.6% of
  children aged six months to four years are vaccinated against Covid, and about
  15% of children aged five to 17 are vaccinated, according to the CDC. While
  older adults have the highest rates of hospitalization and death, children
  continue seeing hospitalization rates from Covid similar to rates in 2020 and
  2021. And there are other concerns with Covid infection. “We don’t know the
  long-term impact for kids who have gotten Covid as a disease. We do know it
  does cause a multi-systemic inflammatory process in a number of kids, which is
  very severe, and we don’t know the long-term implications for long Covid in
  kids,” Benjamin said. Covid cases are rising in many parts of the US amid
  other vaccine restrictions proposed and implemented by health officials.
