  Samsung’s seventh-generation Flip phone trims the fat, gains a bigger cover
  screen on the outside and a larger folding display on the inside, but
  fundamentally doesn’t reinvent the wheel. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 joins the
  book-style Z Fold 7 as Samsung’s two flagship folding phones for 2025. Like
  its predecessors, the Flip’s biggest selling point is that it takes one of the
  largest screens on a Samsung and folds it in half for a more pocket-friendly
  size. Costing from £1,049 (€1,199/$1,099/A$1,799) it is similar in price to
  the regular S25+ and super-thin S25 Edge, but with a slightly larger screen.
  The Flip 7 is slightly taller and wider than its predecessor accommodating the
  larger 6.9in inner display. It is also thinner than the Flip 6 by 1.2mm when
  folded, but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference, unlike the
  transformational change given to the Fold 7 this year. The new larger cover
  display on the outside fills the top half of the Flip 7 encircling the cameras
  and LED flash. It is able to fit more text from notifications and widgets on
  display, but it also looks far better than predecessors. Choose a good
  wallpaper and it looks stunning, particularly in the dark metallic blue
  colour. The Flip 7 has hardened glass on the outside, but the internal screen
  is still covered by a necessarily softer layer that picks up fingerprints,
  suffers from glare and can be easily marked. It requires more care than a
  regular slab phone. The Flip is water resistant but not dust resistant, so
  must be kept away from fine particles that might gum up its hinge.
  Specifications Main screen: 6.9in FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED Infinity Flex Display
  (397ppi) Cover screen: 4.1in AMOLED 120Hz (345ppi) Processor: Samsung Exynos
  2500 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256 or 512GB Operating system: One UI 8 based on
  Android 16 Camera: 50 +12MP rear, 10MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, nano sim
  + esim, wifi7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSS Water resistance: IP48 (1.5-metre
  depths for 30 minutes) Folded dimensions: 85.5 x 75.2 x 13.7mm Unfolded
  dimensions: 166.7 x 75.2 x 6.5mm Weight: 188g Fast and snappy, but a little
  short on battery life The Flip 7 has a Samsung Exynos 2500 chip, which is a
  high-end processor similar to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite used in the rest
  of Samsung’s flagship phone line. It won’t win any raw performance awards, but
  day to day it made the Flip 7 feel rapid with a solid gaming experience, even
  if the phone got quite warm during prolonged sessions. The battery life is
  falls slightly short of the Flip’s predecessors lasting about 36 hours between
  charges while on a mix of 5G and wifi and actively using the screen for about
  six hours. That roughly matches the smallest S25 model and means the Flip 7
  will see out a heavy-use day with most people needing to charge it nightly.
  Note that prolonged use on 5G had a greater drain on the battery than
  Qualcomm-equipped Samsung phones. One UI 8 The Flip 7 is one of the first
  Samsung phones, alongside the Z Fold 7, to run One UI 8 (Android 16) out of
  the box. It is one of the best versions of Android available offering deep
  customisation and solid performance. It looks and behaves very much like the
  software on the standard S25 line, including various AI tools across writing,
  image editing and generation, transcription and translation, and so on. It
  also has Google’s AI services including Gemini and Circle to Search. The Now
  bar is great, showing currently ongoing activities such as sport scores, music
  playback, timers, alarms and other bits. The Flip 7 has some additional tools
  to make use of the folding form. The useful flex mode moves the content, site
  or app to the top half of the screen and puts controls on the bottom half when
  you fold the Flip into an L-shape. It also has multiple tools to use the
  outside screen. You can view notifications, answer texts, control music or
  system settings, access various widgets including a voice recorder and
  calculator, plus talk to Gemini without opening the phone. A handful of apps
  including Google Maps, messages, WhatsApp, Netflix and YouTube can be opened
  on the outside screen too. But to use other apps on the cover screen requires
  downloading Samsung’s MultiStar plugin from the Galaxy Store, which is simple
  enough but should be a default feature. Samsung will provide Android and
  security updates until 31 July 2032. Camera The camera is one of the weaker
  areas of the Flip 7. It has a 50-megapixel main and 12MP ultra wide camera on
  the cover screen and a 10MP selfie camera on the inside. The selfie camera is
  OK but not great, suffering in low light though perfectly fine for video
  calls. Instead you get much better results using the main camera for selfies
  with the cover screen as the viewfinder. The main camera does shoot great
  photos outdoors and in good light, with plenty of detail and solid colours,
  but can be a bit dark, grey and grainy indoors or in difficult lighting
  conditions. The ultra-wide camera is decent for landscapes but struggles in
  lower light settings. The camera has plenty of fun modes, including the
  ability to shoot photos and video partially folded like an old-school handycam
  or propped up for hands-free selfies. Overall the Flip 7 shoots decent photos
  but its cameras aren’t quite on par with what you get on standard flagship
  phones. Sustainability The battery has an expected lifespan of at least 2,000
  full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is
  generally repairable. Inside screen repairs cost about £294. Samsung offers a
  self-repair programme, as well as Care+ accidental damage insurance that
  reduces the cost of repairs to £119. The Flip 7 is made from recycled
  aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements
  and steel, accounting for 18.2% of the weight. Samsung offers trade-in and
  recycling schemes for old devices, and breaks down the phone’s environmental
  impact in its report (pdf). Price The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 costs from
  £1,049 (€1,199/$1,099/A$1,799). For comparison, the Z Fold 7 costs £1,799, the
  S25 Edge costs £1,099, the S25+ costs £999, the Z Flip 7 FE costs £849, the
  Motorola Raze 60 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Xiaomi Mix Flip costs £640.
  Verdict The Flip 7 is Samsung’s most attractive flip phone yet, but the
  biggest upgrade is the larger cover display on the outside. The rest of the
  phone is pretty similar to its predecessors. The internal folding display is
  great, but soft and needs care. The fingerprint scanner in the power button is
  fantastic, but is placed a bit too high up the side of the phone. The cameras
  are decent but not up to the same standards of regular flagship phones, while
  the battery life is a bit on the short side. The software is great and comes
  with seven years of updates. But it all feels very iterative. The Flip 7 is
  the still the best way to fit a large screen in a small pocket, but it’s
  crying out for the kind of transformational redesign given to its larger Fold
  7 sibling this year. Pros: bigger outside screen, great large screen that
  folds in half, IP48 water-resistant, great software with seven years of
  updates, plenty of AI features, attractive design, fun. Cons: expensive, less
  durable than a regular phone and costly to fix, no dust resistance, camera
  lacks telephoto zoom and not up to par with regular flagship phones, not a
  major update.
