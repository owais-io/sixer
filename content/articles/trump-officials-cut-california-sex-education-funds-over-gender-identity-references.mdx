  The Trump administration has terminated a grant that provided millions of
  dollars for a California sex education program after the state refused to
  remove all references to gender identity, transgender people and nonbinary
  people from its curriculum. Advocates fear more states could lose more money
  in a burgeoning war between the Trump administration and supporters of
  comprehensive sex ed. In June, the federal Administration for Children and
  Families warned California that it had 60 days to remove the references from
  the curriculum for the state’s Personal Responsibility Education Program
  (Prep), a federally funded sex-ed program that aims to prevent pregnancy and
  childhood STIs. It argued that such references were outside the program’s
  scope. On Tuesday, California notified the Trump administration that it would
  not change its Prep curriculum, arguing that the materials were medically
  accurate, necessary to help prepare young people for the complexities of adult
  relationships and had already been approved by the Administration for Children
  and Families. Moreover, the letter argued, its materials were in line with the
  law, while the administration’s threat was not. Government records indicate
  that California’s Prep grant was worth roughly $6m, although Reuters reported
  that California now stands to lose a total of about $12m in federal funding.
  The Administration for Children and Families did not immediately reply to a
  request for clarification. “California’s refusal to comply with federal law
  and remove egregious gender ideology from federally funded sex-ed materials is
  unacceptable,” Andrew Gradison, the acting assistant secretary at the
  Administration for Children and Families, said in a statement. “Accountability
  is coming for every state that uses federal funds to teach children delusional
  gender ideology.” Examples listed in the June letter included a middle-school
  lesson plan stating that “there are also people who don’t identify as boys or
  girls, but rather as transgender or gender queer. This means that even if they
  were called a boy or a girl at birth and may have body parts that are
  typically associated with being a boy or a girl, on the inside, they feel
  differently.” Another example was from a high school lesson: “Remind students
  that some men are born with female anatomy, some women are born with male
  anatomy.” In total, the Trump administration distributes about $75m each year
  to more than 50 states, territories, tribes and organizations to teach Prep to
  students. It has demanded that all recipients of Prep money turn over their
  curricula, from teachers’ manuals to PowerPoint presentations to parental
  consent forms, for a “medical accuracy review”. The future of other federally
  funded sex ed programs may also be in doubt. The Trump administration has also
  informed recipients of funding for the $101m Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program
  (TPPP) that their curricula cannot include information about gender identity
  or diversity, equity and inclusion. Experts and advocates worry that the
  federal government will increasingly weaponize sex ed funding to strangle
  efforts not only to teach young people about LGBTQ+ rights and issues, but
  also to undermine comprehensive sex ed writ large. “It’s an inappropriate use
  of federal authority,” said Lisa MF Andersen, a historian who co-authored the
  book Touchy Subject: The History and Philosophy of Sex Education. She could
  not think of any precedent for the Trump administration’s actions. “It’s a
  really weirdly political method to use – to try to use funding instead of
  trying to use legislation,” she said. “A lot of these things should be left up
  to Congress.” During Donald Trump’s first term, his administration abruptly
  informed dozens of TPPP recipients that their grants would end years earlier
  than planned. Courts later ruled that Trump’s actions were unlawful. Although
  sex ed policy is largely set at the local and state level in the US,
  presidential administrations still hold enormous sway over it because of their
  ability to pour billions of dollars into the kinds of programs that they
  prefer. Project 2025, the famous playbook of conservative policies written by
  the thinktank Heritage Foundation, urges federal agencies to specifically
  increase their scrutiny of PREP and TPPP “so that they do not promote abortion
  or high-risk sexual behavior among adolescents”. The playbook also recommends
  that these programs’ grant money should be given to curricula that prioritizes
  “sexual risk avoidance”, or abstinence-only-until-marriage sex ed. The federal
  government already maintains a separate grant program, known as the Title V
  State Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program, that devotes about $50m
  annually to abstinence-only sex ed. Research has repeatedly found that
  abstinence-only sex ed has failed to persuade people to avoid premarital sex.
  The California department of public health did not immediately respond to a
  request for comment on the state’s defunding. But Jorge Reyes Salinas,
  communications director for the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Equality
  California, said that stripping California of funding would have long-lasting
  consequences for young people. “Studies consistently show us that LGBTQ+
  students, especially trans and nonbinary youth, face higher rates of bullying,
  harassment and suicide. Especially now, we’re seeing those numbers skyrocket,”
  Reyes Salinas said. “Inclusive education reduces stigma and saves lives.”
