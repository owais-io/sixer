  I’m watching overtourism in action. Within the iridescent marvel that is
  Croatia’s Blue Cave, four boats holding about a dozen people each have an
  allotted 10 minutes before we motor back out again so that the next batch of
  visitors can float in. About 1,500 people a day visit this beautiful grotto on
  the island of Biševo, the biggest attraction within the Vis archipelago, two
  hours and 20 minutes south of Split by ferry. After paying the €24 entrance
  fee, I’m left underwhelmed by this maritime conveyor belt. At least the
  45-minute foot ferry from Komiža, on the archipelago’s main island of Vis, to
  Biševo’s Mezoporat Bay, the launch point for boats to the Blue Cave, is only
  €4. Many of the other cave visitors are on one of the countless speedboat
  tours departing from all over Dalmatia and crowding into Mezoporat Bay before
  whizzing off elsewhere. I’m staying on Vis itself to take a longer, slower,
  more satisfying look at the island, where I spent a night three years ago and
  which I’ve been hankering to revisit ever since. Despite the overwhelming
  popularity of the nearby Blue Cave and its speedboat tours, plus the boost in
  tourism on Vis after much of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was filmed here in
  2017, I know there’s a quieter, mellower side to the island, and it doesn’t
  take long to find it. In sleepy Rukavac on Vis’s south-eastern coast, British
  couple Xania and Craig Wear welcome me into one of their four guest rooms in
  the large stone house they renovated after moving here 20 years ago. The
  former PE teachers run WearActive, offering yoga, kayaking, paddleboarding and
  cycling in Rukavac. On their seven-day, “relaxingly active” holidays you can
  do as much or as little as you like. “Actively relaxing”, I find, is just as
  fitting a description. Xania serves delicious plant-based food on the large
  shaded terrace, which has views of the sea. But before breakfast we walk to
  the flat rocks of Bili Bok beach, where Craig puts me through my yoga paces.
  Clean, salty air fills my lungs as I lunge and stretch by the Adriatic. I
  follow this with a swim at nearby Srebrna beach. Late afternoons are spent
  lazing on the pebbles at Tepluš beach, 10 minutes’ walk from the house. I
  could get used to this. The next morning, my hosts suggest kayaking 6 miles
  (10km) from Rukavac to Stiniva Bay, Vis’s most famous beach and a place of
  peerless beauty. Two giant limestone cliffs curve round the pebbly beach,
  nearly meeting in the middle. From the top of the hill behind the cliffs
  there’s a steep, rocky footpath to the beach, but it’s infinitely more
  enjoyable to paddle on to the beach, where only kayaks, paddleboards and small
  rubber dinghies are allowed. Craig is on a paddleboard, while Xania and I
  share a kayak, and my husband has a single kayak. At 8.30am there are only
  about four people here, and we have a blissful, peaceful swim. Craig knows
  I’ve always wanted to learn how to paddleboard, so on the way back to Rukavac
  we stop in tranquil Ruda bay. After some expert instruction, I’m on the board
  and paddling away, initial jitters soothed by the hypnotic motion of gliding
  on the water. Now I see what all the fuss is about. Away from the water, my
  husband and I get to know Vis more intimately, crisscrossing its
  vineyard-covered interior and heading up and down its winding mountain roads.
  Its capital, Vis town, dozes during the day, most restaurants closing while
  the sailing crowd cruises. It comes alive at night, the restaurant terraces
  along the Venetian harbour buzzing in the summertime warmth. Smaller Komiža is
  the place for lunch, with everything from cheap pizzerias to smart
  restaurants. Near Gusarica beach we find Konoba Jastožera, a restaurant built
  on stilts over the water, where lobster pots hold the restaurant’s
  speciality.It’s only when I hear the soundtrack to the Mamma Mia! films that I
  realise we’ve stumbled on one of the sequel’s filming locations, and instantly
  expect high prices and low quality. Wrong on both counts. As long as we don’t
  order lobster, it’s one of the most affordable restaurants we’ve seen so far,
  with two courses for €25. It’s not all money, money, money here. For an island
  that was off limits to foreigners until 1989, when the Yugoslav army base here
  closed down, Vis seems to be taking its time in developing its tourism
  (Biševo’s Blue Cave aside). I spot a few military tours about, taking people
  to the huge network of tunnels and bunkers left behind by the army. I get a
  fascinating glimpse into 1944 Vis when I hike up to the collection of caves at
  the foot of Mount Hum, where future Yugoslav president Tito and his fellow
  partisans hid from the Nazis. Then there’s the growth of active holiday
  companies bringing more people to the island, which Xania sees as a positive
  thing, even if it means more competition. “Vis would then become an island
  that’s known for its adventure holidays,” she says. “And then you have more
  people coming to do that kind of tourism.” I nod in agreement. The island’s
  natural rhythm – slow, unhurried – is one to be savoured, not raced through.
  The trip was provided by WearActive, which offers seven-night active holidays
  from €1,590pp, including breakfast, four lunches, three dinners with wine,
  five days of activities, transfers to restaurants on four evenings and from
  Vis town ferry terminal
