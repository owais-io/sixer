  climate program

  The Trump administration’s decision to abruptly terminate a $3bn program
  helping hundreds of communities prepare for climate disasters and
  environmental hazards is unconstitutional and should be overturned, a court
  will hear on Tuesday. A coalition of non-profits, tribes and local governments
  is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the agency’s
  administrator, Lee Zeldin, for terminating the entire Environmental and
  Climate Justice (ECJ) block grant program – despite a legally binding mandate
  from Congress to fund the Biden-era initiative. It’s a first-of-a-kind
  proposed class-action lawsuit that would force the EPA and Zeldin to reinstate
  the program and each individual grant, rather than forcing the recipients to
  sue individually. The $3bn ECJ program was created by Congress through the
  2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – a longstanding source for ire for Trump
  and his polluting industry allies – to help historically disadvantaged
  communities come up with local solutions to improve resilience in the face of
  worsening climate shocks and environmental degradation. It was intended by
  Congress to fund community-based projects across the country to tackle
  longstanding and pressing environmental harms that cause death and ill health
  from hazards including industrial pollution, lead pipes, flooding and urban
  heat islands. Almost 350 rural and urban groups, towns and tribes were
  selected by the EPA from 2,700 applicants, through a rigorous process that
  included long-term accountability and oversight over the funds. In February,
  Zeldin’s EPA, under the direction of the Trump administration, began
  terminating the entire ECJ program, as part of a broader assault on climate
  science, climate action and environmental justice measures. In June, 23 grant
  recipients sued after the entire block grant was terminated and the funds
  frozen overnight. The plaintiffs come from every region of the country and
  include the Indigenous village of Pipnuk in Alaska, the Deep South Centre for
  Environmental Justice in New Orleans, Appalachian Voices, which works with
  legacy coal communities, and Kalamazoo county in Michigan. Several non-profit
  legal advocacy groups – EarthJustice, Southern Environmental Law Center,
  Public Rights Project and Lawyers for Good Government – filed the proposed
  class-action lawsuit alleging that the wholesale termination violated the
  separation of powers and is therefore unconstitutional. They also argue that
  the Trump administration’s decision was both “arbitrary and capricious” – in
  other words, made without proper reasoning or consideration of the
  consequences, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. On Tuesday,
  attorneys representing the coalition will argue for preliminary relief at the
  US district court for the District of Columbia (DDC), to force the EPA to
  immediately reinstate the ECJ program and unfreeze the funds. “This was an
  unlawful action that went against the will of Congress and violated the
  separation of powers,” said Ben Grillot, senior attorney with the Southern
  Environmental Law Center. “The administration terminated the entire program
  simply because they don’t like it, without any reasoned decision making or
  consideration of the impacts. The decision was both arbitrary and capricious,
  and unconstitutional, and should be overturned.” The Trump administration has
  filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the DDC does not have jurisdiction,
  and this is a contractual case for the US court of federal claims. Under
  contract law, the 349 grant recipients would be forced to sue individually for
  breach of contract and damages, but with no possibility of the ECJ program
  being reinstated as Congress intended. A ruling on if and where the case
  continues is expected later this month. The judge will rule separately on the
  plaintiffs’ motion for the case to proceed as a class action. The EPA said it
  did not comment on pending litigation.
