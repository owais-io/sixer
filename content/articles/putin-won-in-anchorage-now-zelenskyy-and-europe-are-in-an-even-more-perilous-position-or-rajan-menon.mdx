  Donald Trump portrays himself as a hard-nosed dealmaker. Yet in the run-up to
  Friday’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, his claim that the
  Russian leader held him in high regard and was therefore serious about ending
  the war in Ukraine sounded naive. Putin doesn’t let sentimentality shape his
  political and military decisions. Nor has he disavowed his longstanding claim
  to four Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk and Luhansk, which together comprise
  Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south.
  Despite Russia’s overwhelming numerical advantage in troops and weaponry,
  Putin occupies only one province, Luhansk, almost entirely. Yet he persists.
  In the days before his meeting with Putin, Trump said the Russian economy
  “stinks” and that falling oil prices would cause Russia’s war to run aground.
  The war has certainly placed severe strains on Russia’s economy, including
  high inflation and interest rates, labour shortages and a lack of investment
  by private businesses. Earnings from oil sales, a key source of state income,
  have also shrunk by 18% this year due to falling prices. There has even been
  talk of a recession. But these pressures have not prompted Putin to reassess
  his war plans. He ignored Trump’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which
  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accepted right away. Likewise, he
  was unfazed by Trump’s threats to impose additional sanctions – with “severe
  consequences”, as he put it just before the summit – if Russia did not relent.
  Trump returned from Anchorage empty-handed for other reasons. Successful
  summits require painstaking advance work by leaders’ subordinates; this one
  was arranged in haste. Given the rush, it was unsurprising that the Anchorage
  talks ended hours ahead of time. (The working lunch the two delegations were
  to have was cancelled.) During his post-summit press conference, Trump gamely
  praised Putin’s goodwill and said that they had agreed on “many points” during
  discussions that he described as “productive”. Yet he failed to identify a
  single point of agreement and, atypically, didn’t stay to answer reporters’
  questions. Putin came out ahead in Anchorage. He didn’t agree to Trump’s pet
  proposal for a ceasefire. It was Trump who ended up accepting Putin’s position
  that a ceasefire must be preceded by a comprehensive peace agreement that
  addresses the “root causes” of the war. Putin did show some flexibility by
  agreeing to freeze the frontline if Ukraine were to withdraw from Donetsk and
  Luhansk, and thus the entire Donbas, enabling Russia to acquire lands it has
  failed to conquer despite more than 40 months of fighting. Yet this offer
  could prove to be a trap. If Zelenskyy, who arrives in Washington for talks
  with Trump on Monday, refuses to do this, Putin may be able to look on as
  Trump tries to coerce the Ukrainian leader, forcing Europe to take sides. If
  Trump fails, Putin can paint Zelenskyy as the real obstacle to peace. Trump
  had declared that there would be no future talks if the summit failed – which
  it did, as he couldn’t obtain a ceasefire, his main objective – yet in
  Anchorage, he spoke of follow-up meetings. Putin concurred, mischievously
  suggesting Moscow as the venue, but without indicating that he was open to
  including Zelenskyy and European leaders. By agreeing to further negotiations
  and keeping Trump’s hopes for a peace deal alive, Putin may have ensured that
  the efficacy of additional US sanctions on Russia remains untested. By simply
  showing up in Anchorage, Putin demonstrated that the western policy of
  isolating him won’t work. Zelenskyy and European leaders are undoubtedly
  relieved that the duo didn’t unveil a deal to end the war by partitioning
  Ukraine. Still, Trump’s readiness to accept Putin’s insistence on this
  bilateral meeting after US efforts to include Zelenskyy failed had already
  sown more mistrust between Washington and Europe. Now Trump has embraced
  Putin’s view that there can be no ceasefire without an overall agreement that
  addresses all aspects of the conflict. He has also in effect endorsed Putin’s
  call for Ukraine to cede Donbas in exchange for a freeze of the frontline.
  These shifts will increase Ukraine and Europe’s distrust of Trump – to Putin’s
  advantage. Putin’s confidence in Russia’s eventual victory has been bolstered
  by Trump’s decision, taken well before the summit, to cease direct weapons
  deliveries to Ukraine – assistance that totalled $65.9bn while Joe Biden was
  the US president. Russia will continue bombing Ukraine’s cities, and its
  ground troops will keep pushing to grab even more land. In this respect, the
  summit has changed nothing. What has changed since Trump’s return to the White
  House, though, is the US’s role in the war. Ultimately, Trump believes that
  Russia’s invasion does not threaten the US so it’s up to the Europeans to
  support Ukraine’s defence, a point JD Vance reiterated shortly before the
  summit. European countries have been increasing its defence spending and
  military support to Ukraine. But it had better be prepared to do even more and
  summon the unity to stay the course. Meanwhile, the lure of additional talks
  with Putin will keep alive Trump’s illusion that continued diplomatic
  engagement with Russia and his self-proclaimed deal-making skills will
  eventually end the war – clearing the path to the Nobel peace prize he covets.
