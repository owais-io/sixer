  Good morning. A powerful earthquake that hit eastern Afghanistan has left more
  than 800 people dead and injured about 2,500, according to Taliban officials.
  The magnitude 6 earthquake hit four provinces in eastern Afghanistan around
  midnight on Sunday, with the rugged, mountainous region of Kunar the worst
  affected, triggering landslides and flooding. The earthquake was shallow,
  taking place close to the Earth’s surface, which is known to cause greater
  destruction. Several aftershocks were reported throughout the night and into
  Monday morning, which could even be felt in the capital, Kabul, more than 100
  miles away. Is the death toll expected to rise? Yes, it’s expected to rise
  significantly as local hospitals report being inundated with casualties and
  hundreds still remain unaccounted for. Medics at the provincial hospital in
  Asadabad in Kunar described the situation as an overwhelming crisis, with new
  patients arriving every few minutes. Trump says he plans unconstitutional
  executive order to mandate ID for voters Donald Trump has said he will issue
  an executive order to mandate identification for all US elections, a move
  likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional. “Voter I.D. Must Be Part
  of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To
  That End!!!,” the US president said on Truth Social late on Saturday. Trump
  also said he wanted to ban all voting by mail except for those who are very
  ill or in military service. The US constitution grants primary authority to
  regulate elections to the states, while empowering Congress to enact election
  laws or regulations. It gives no explicit authority to the president to
  regulate voting. Why does Trump want to mandate ID for voters? The voting
  reform push by Trump stems from baseless claims that the 2020 election he lost
  was stolen from him. Judge orders US to halt deportation of hundreds of
  Guatemalan children A US judge yesterday ordered an emergency halt to a plan
  by the Trump administration to deport a group of nearly 700 unaccompanied
  Guatemalan children back to their home country after immigrant advocates
  lawyers called the plan “illegal”. Attorneys for 10 Guatemalan minors, ages 10
  to 17, said in court papers filed late on Saturday that there were reports
  that planes were set to take off within hours for the Central American
  country. What happened yesterday? A federal judge in Washington said those
  children couldn’t be deported for at least 14 days, and after a hastily
  scheduled hearing yesterday, she enforced that they needed to be taken off the
  planes and back to the Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities while the
  legal process plays out. In other news … A suspect has been arrested over the
  murder of the former Ukrainian parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy has said. Doctors have found a drug that is better than aspirin at
  preventing heart attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform
  health guidelines worldwide. The United States has suspended visa approvals
  for nearly everyone who holds a Palestinian passport, the New York Times
  reported yesterday. An extravagant – and continuing – makeover of the White
  House’s decor has taken place during the president’s second term. One color

  urchins devastated Pacific kelp. In recent years, scientists have staged a

  projects in the world. To do so, they’ve recruited an army of hammer-wielding
  divers to smash and clean up the voracious urchins. Don’t miss this: I’m a
  liberal who loves hunting. Allow me to change your mind In Missoula, where I
