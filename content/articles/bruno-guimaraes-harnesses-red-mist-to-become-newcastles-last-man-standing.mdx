  It was never him. Those outside may have thought it was him, and he might
  himself have thought it was him. Alexander Isak was appreciated, inspired awe
  as he became close to the Premier League’s greatest striker, and was even
  loved, as the celebratory chant hailing their striker from Sweden – to the
  tune of Abba’s Gimme Gimme Gimme – rang around pubs and playgrounds alike. Yet
  he was never quite The One. As St James’ Park cheered in response to the home
  lineup being read out over the speakers, nobody received the roar that Bruno
  Guimarães did. Even after a late, dramatic defeat to the Liverpool that have
  spent this summer as the Geordies’ bogeyman, threatening to take Isak away,
  that tumult will endure. It is bittersweet now, as the supporters nurse a deep
  sense of betrayal over their absent forward, that Isak and Guimarães were
  dually complicit in the funniest, and most touching, of moments during March’s
  celebrations following the Carabao Cup win. Isak mischievously prodded
  Guimarães into singing the X-rated version of the Sandro Tonali song, even
  though the Brazilian had just promised Ant and Dec he wouldn’t swear, like a
  conniving elder brother pushing his unwitting younger sibling headfirst into
  trouble. Like family. Now the roles are reversed, with Isak having taken his
  ball home and Guimarães wearing the long trousers. “There’s a lot of outside
  noise around this fixture,” wrote the Brazilian in his captain’s column in the
  match programme, “but it’s the noise our fans create tonight that’s going to
  make the difference.” Guimarães has always, despite that giddy on-stage faux
  pas in the delirium of the cup winning celebrations, been a skilled
  communicator. Six weeks after he arrived in Europe, Covid-19 hit and the
  French season shut down. He spent the best part of the next four months
  indoors, away from friends and family, and emerged from it speaking excellent
  French, and as one of the team leaders as Lyon emerged from hibernation to
  reach the Champions League semi-finals. When he left less than 18 months later
  to join an intended Newcastle revolution which was far from a sure thing
  Guimarães clicked with the city, and its fans, instantly. Kieran Trippier will
  always be rightfully recognised as the first name to take that leap of faith
  in early 2022 with Newcastle glued to the Premier League’s basement but
  Guimarães was the first young star with other options to arrive, to believe in
  what the Geordies dreamed of with the same almost blind optimism. He left a
  strong side to join a struggling team, talking of the future and of the
  Champions League while the ink was still wet on his contract. On nights like
  these Guimarães tends to be different, less inspired by the atmosphere but
  unleashed, the embodiment of Eddie Howe’s famous phrase “intensity is our
  identity”. His getting pumped up started in those programme notes, which
  contained a thinly veiled shot at Isak. “For me, representing Newcastle United
  and our supporters makes me as proud as it did on my first day here,” he
  continued. “Both of my children are Geordies and it’s a privilege to be
  captain of this club and to wear the black and white shirt.” Yet this was
  almost a tentative Guimarães at the start, as Tonali sped around into
  challenges like a de facto Guimarães early on, like the real thing was
  stopping himself from being overexcited by the occasion. Despite being
  absolutely crunched by Ryan Gravenberch in the first 10 minutes he kept his
  counsel, perhaps to his and his team’s detriment. After a spell of home
  pressure ratcheting up an already bubbling atmosphere – which might have led
  to tangible reward with a centre-forward of renown – Gravenberch’s
  against-the-tide opener came from a shot taken early with Guimarães electing
  to jockey rather than challenge, with the Dutch midfielder’s strike sliding
  past Nick Pope. Perhaps Anthony Gordon’s rush of blood to the head underlined
  the wisdom of this usually most effervescent of characters keeping his powder
  dry. For later, it was Guimarães that brought Newcastle back into it, heading
  in to halve a 2-0 deficit when it was hard to see where a goal might come
  from, when even the crowd had dampened and stopped believing. The goal didn’t
  just wake St James’ – it woke Bruno too. As he piled a clearance into Milos
  Kerkez to win a throw in front of the dugouts he yelled, gesticulating with
  both arms to the crowd to keep up the renewed pace. As his team continued to
  chase the game he clattered into a barely arrived Federico Chiesa, treading
  his habitual tightrope between yellow and red. In the immediate aftermath of
  Will Osula’s unlikely equaliser he did so again, shaking Tino Livramento by
  the shirt as he won a free-kick to stem any instant Liverpool reaction. This
  is him. There is no poker face; when he’s angry he can’t hide it, neither when
  he’s labouring. We see every sinew stretch. Here he was last man standing,
  with Tonali and then Joelinton succumbing to second-half injuries. And yet,
  after Rio Ngumoha’s remarkable late, late winner, it still wasn’t enough. But
  Newcastle know that whatever their current headaches and shortcomings their
  skipper will never stop trying to drag them further, whatever the odds.
