  Maëva Squiban fuelled joyous scenes in the Haute-Savoie, winning the first
  high mountain stage of the 2025 Tour de France Femmes in Chambéry, just 24
  hours after taking victory in stage six in Ambert. The French rider, who
  celebrated draped in a Breton flag, was part of a 13-rider breakaway that
  splintered on the first climb, the Côte de Saint-Franc, and then gradually
  dwindled as the gradients started to bite. Squiban, a former French junior
  champion when 15 years old, finally shed her last companion, Mareille
  Meijering, 2km from the top of the Col du Granier and accelerated clear alone.
  “At the start, I made a joke about attacking again,” she said, “but in the end
  it wasn’t a joke.” On the fast descent of the Granier, overlooking Chambéry,
  Squiban, nudging 80km/h on the narrow road, again held off the pursuing group
  of race favourites, including the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma, and
  rival Demi Vollering, to take successive stage wins. Further down the Granier,
  Kim Le Court’s time in yellow appeared to have come to an end when the group
  of favourites picked up the pace, and her closest rival, France’s Pauline
  Ferrand-Prévot, briefly became race leader on the road. But Le Court was saved
  by her fearless descending. The Mauritian did not panic and her dogged pursuit
  of the group containing Niewiadoma, Vollering and Ferrand-Prévot paid off when
  she rejoined them close to the finish. “I think I almost died a few times on
  the descent,” Le Court said. “The last 4km of the uphill were difficult. My
  body just completely shut off. “Once I got to the top, I knew I had to do the
  best downhill of my life to try and come back. I did a recon of the descent a
  few weeks ago so I knew what was coming, and I just had to go full gas. I
  think I went 10 times faster than the recon.” Meanwhile, on the eve of the
  toughest mountain stage in the race, Ferrand-Prévot’s drastic weight loss was
  the subject of some scrutiny after images of her racing jersey, pinned at the
  sleeve so it didn’t hang loosely, emerged in the Dutch media. The debate has
  been fuelled by comments made by French rider Cédrine Kerbaol who, alarmed by
  the weight loss among her peers, told French media: “We’re in a dangerous
  moment. There are a lot of people that have won big races with very low
  weight, and young girls, who are trying to perform, will take them as an
  example. What’s happening is not great.” “Top-level sport is extreme in every
  way,” Rutger Tijssen, sport technical manager at Ferrand-Prévot’s Visma-Lease
  a Bike team, told Sporza. On Saturday, when the women’s peloton will tackle
  both the 13km-long Col de Plainpalais and, later, a summit finish on the
  “beyond category” Col de la Madeleine – an 18.6km climb to 2,000m –
  power-to-weight ratios will be pivotal. “Pauline’s leaner than in the spring,”
  Tijssen said, “but this also requires different things when you have to climb
  the Col de la Madeleine. Then it’s logical that you adapt.” Ferrand-Prévot won
  the Olympic mountain bike title at Paris 2024 but has since devoted herself to
  road racing with the goal of winning the Tour de France Femmes. “She’s not
  much leaner than she was a year ago,” Tijssen said. “Of course, she stays
  healthy. You know what’s happening and you make choices, which we monitor.”
  The next 48 hours will decide the outcome of the race, which includes summit
  finishes on the Madeleine and at Châtel, as well as the daunting climb of the
  Col de Joux Plane on Sunday. Only 35 seconds currently separate the top five
  in the overall standings, but with more than 6,000 metres of climbing still to
  come, those gaps are certain to widen.
