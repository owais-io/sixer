  OpenAI is taking on Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Chinese rival DeepSeek by
  launching its own freely available artificial intelligence models. The ChatGPT
  developer has announced two “open weight” large language models, which are
  free to download and can be customised by developers. Meta’s Llama models are
  available on a similar basis, and OpenAI’s move marks a departure from
  ChatGPT, which is based on a “closed” model that cannot be customised. Sam
  Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said the company was excited to add to a
  stack of freely available AI models “based on democratic values … and for wide
  benefit”. He added: “We’re excited to make this model, the result of billions
  of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the
  most people possible.” OpenAI said the models could underpin an AI agent that
  operates autonomously, and that they were “designed to be used within agentic
  workflows”. Zuckerberg, similarly, has said that making models freely
  available and customisable will “ensure that more people around the world have
  access to the benefits and opportunities of AI” and that power is not
  concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies. However, Meta has
  said his company may need to be “careful” about taking a similar approach with
  highly advanced AI models. DeepSeek, a Chinese rival to OpenAI and Meta, has
  also released powerful models that can be downloaded and customised freely.
  OpenAI said the two models, called gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b-two,
  outperformed similarly sized models on reasoning tasks, with the larger, 120b
  model achieving a near-equal performance to its o4-mini model in terms of core
  reasoning. The company added that during the testing process it had created
  “maliciously fine-tuned” versions of the models to simulate biological and
  cybersecurity threats but found they were “unable to reach high capability
  levels”. The existence of freely available, powerful AI models that can be
  customised by developers has alarmed some experts who have warned that they
  could be adapted to cause serious harm, such as developing bioweapons. Meta
  has defined its Llama models as “open source”, meaning they can also be
  downloaded and customised freely, while their training datasets, architecture
  and training code are also provided. However, the Open Source Initiative, a
  US-based industry organisation, has said the restrictions Meta places on using
  its models mean it does not qualify as fully open source. OpenAI has used the
  term “open weight”, in effect a notch down from open source, which means the
  model can still be fine-tuned – but its workings are not fully transparent to
  the developer. OpenAI’s announcement came amid speculation that a new version
  of the model that underpins ChatGPT could be released soon. On Sunday Altman
  shared a screenshot of what appeared to be the company’s latest AI model,
  GPT-5. Meanwhile, Google has outlined its latest step towards artificial
  general intelligence (AGI) with a new model that allows AI systems to interact
  with a convincing simulation of the real world. The Genie 3 “world model”
  could be used to train robots and autonomous vehicles as they engage with
  realistic recreations of environments such as warehouses, according to Google.
  Its AI division, Google DeepMind, argues that world models are a key step to
  achieving AGI, a hypothetical level of AI where a system can carry out most
  tasks on a par with humans – rather than just individual tasks such as playing
  chess or translating languages – and potentially do someone’s job. DeepMind
  said such models would play an important role in the development of AI agents,
  or systems that carry out tasks autonomously. “We expect this technology to
  play a critical role as we push toward AGI, and agents play a greater role in
  the world,” DeepMind said.
