  Licence to burn: Victoria is changing the way it deals with rubbish – is it
  moving too fast?

  On Melbourne’s suburban fringe, plans have been quietly taking shape that will
  change how Victoria deals with its rubbish. Last Wednesday, seven
  waste-to-energy plants were given the green light, in addition to four already
  approved – a total surpassing the rest of the country combined. Together, the
  new projects will have a licence to burn through 2.35m tonnes of rubbish a
  year – more than double the 1m-tonne limit the Victorian parliament set when
  it first legislated the waste-to-energy scheme in 2022. But the plan faces
  opposition – from some residents of outer-suburban communities slated to host
  the plants, and also from within Labor’s own ranks. Legalise Cannabis MP
  Rachel Payne says she is worried about how fast the program is growing. “This
  is the most significant shift in how we manage waste in Victoria’s history and
  while on paper it sounds great, we really don’t know enough about it,” Payne
  says. Next Wednesday, she will use a motion in parliament to call for a pause
  and a review of the economic, social and environmental impacts of
  waste-to-energy in the state. A similar inquiry, put forward by the Nationals,
  has also been established in New South Wales. ‘Quick fix’ Waste-to-energy – a
  process that involves burning non-recyclable waste in high-temperature
  furnaces to generate electricity or heat – has experienced a surge of interest
  in Australia as landfills near capacity. Sign up: AU Breaking News email One
  plant is already operational south of Perth, in Western Australia, with
  another under construction nearby, and there are proposals in NSW, Queensland
  and South Australia. The practice however, remains banned in the ACT. Victoria
  began exploring waste-to-energy as part of an overhaul of its waste and
  recycling system after China’s 2018 decision to restrict recycling imports. In
  2020, the state released a new waste policy, citing a need to develop the
  industry to help reach its target of diverting 80% of waste from landfill by
  2030. But an auditor-general’s report, released in April, said there had been
  little progress: “The proportion of waste going to landfill has not changed in
  the four years since the circular economy policy started.” Payne says as a
  result, the state has embraced waste-to-energy as a “quick fix solution” to
  meet its goal. Victoria’s first waste-to-energy project, at a Maryvale paper
  mill in the Latrobe Valley, has joined with nine councils in Melbourne’s south
  east to take up to 95% of their waste because there is no space left for it
  locally. Part of this plan involves a new waste transfer station in Hampton
  Park, within Payne’s upper house region, where rubbish would be collected and
  trucked to Maryvale. But the Environment Protection Authority refused the
  application in April, citing risks to human health and the environment due to
  odour and noise emissions near homes. This decision is now under appeal. Payne
  says there’s been little consultation with the community, which is culturally
  diverse and lower-income. “Just think if this was happening in a more affluent
  area – there would be much more community outrage, they wouldn’t want it in
  their back yard,” Payne says. “Working-class suburbs shouldn’t be the literal
  dumping ground for these sites.” The auditor-general’s report identified three
  more facilities in development with a combined annual capacity of 1.1m tonnes.
  It found if the government approved additional licences, up to its 2m-tonne
  cap, Victoria could divert up to 87% of current waste from landfill. Since the
  report, the cap has been lifted even higher, to 2.5m tonnes. This has allowed
  for seven more licences to be granted: to Cleanaway Operations, HiQ EFW
  Victoria, Knox Transfer Station Pty Ltd, Liquid Power Co Pty Ltd, Melbourne
  Water Corporation, Recovered Energy Laverton Pty Ltd and Zerogen Holdings Pty
  Ltd. Recycling Victoria says many are still in feasibility stages with final
  locations to be confirmed through EPA and planning approvals processes.
  Concerns over health impacts In Wollert, north of Melbourne, resident Julie
  Ahmad first learned of the proposal for a plant 7km from her home via a social
  media post in February 2024. “I was very concerned because the community did
  not know anything about it. I knew nothing about it. There was no information
  about what this incinerator entails,” she says. At that time, the proposal was
  380,000 tonnes per year capacity, but by the Wednesday 13 August announcement
  that had grown to 760,000 tonnes. Cleanaway, who will operate the Wollert
  site, says it has been talking to the community since the project was
  announced in 2021, including in person and online information sessions,
  one-on-one meetings and in languages including Arabic, Hindi and Urdu.
  “Cleanaway also established a stakeholder reference group made up of local
  residents from a range of diverse cultural and religious backgrounds with an
  interest in the proposal, providing an active channel between the local
  community and Cleanaway,” a spokesperson said. Ahmad, who has co-founded the
  No Northern Incinerator Wollert in response, says her main concerns are about
  the environmental and health impacts of the plants. Dr Peter Tait, a general
  practitioner and member of Public Health Association of Australia, the peak
  body for public health professionals, undertook a review of the health impacts
  of modern waste-to-energy plants, published in 2019. Tait says the health
  risks associated with waste incineration were “low, but not nothing”, and
  could be high in certain circumstances. The majority of incinerators plan to
  burn municipal solid waste – the sort of material in kerbside bins – and its
  the plastics and metals in common garbage that could emit furans and dioxins
  in the process of being burnt. “If we’re going to build them, then they need
  to be built to the highest possible standard, and more importantly, they need
  to be operated to the highest possible standard,” Tait says. He recommends
  real-time, continuous monitoring of emissions and contamination at the plants,
  and in surrounding communities and nearby food-growing area, and for residents
  concerns to be taken seriously. In Wollert, nearly 2,500 people have signed a
  parliamentary petition opposing the project. Sponsored by local Labor MP
  Bronwyn Halfpenny, the petition says the proposed site is within 2km of a
  retirement village, 400 metres from a creek and several schools. Among its
  signatories is the energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, who represents the
  neighbouring Mill Park electorate and who steered the waste-to-energy strategy
  through parliament in 2022. A similar facility proposed in Lara, which is yet
  to secure government approval, is fiercely opposed by local Labor MP Ella
  George and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, whose federal seat takes in
  the area. But with Victorians sending 4.5m tonnes of rubbish to landfill each
  year, the pressure will only grow about how to manage it.
