  A New Zealand woman has appeared in court charged with neglecting a child,
  after a bus driver discovered a toddler stowed in a suitcase within the
  luggage compartment. Police were called to a bus depot in Kaiwaka, 60 miles
  (100km) north of Auckland, after the bus driver became concerned about a bag
  moving during a scheduled stop. “When the driver opened the suitcase, they
  discovered the two-year-old girl,” DI Simon Harrison said. “The little girl
  was reported to be very hot, but otherwise appeared physically unharmed.” The
  luggage had been stored beneath the bus passengers, in a separate compartment.
  The girl was in hospital undergoing an extensive medical assessment, Harrison
  said. He added that the driver prevented “what could have been a far worse
  outcome”. “We would like to acknowledge and commend the bus driver, who
  noticed something wasn’t right and took immediate action,” Harrison said. A
  27-year-old woman appeared in the North Shore district court on Monday
  afternoon, after being charged with ill-treatment and neglect of a child.
  Court documents allege the woman had been travelling from Whangārei to
  Auckland on a bus and had placed the child in a closed suitcase in the bus
  stowaway, local news outlet Stuff reported. New Zealand’s ministry for
  children, Oranga Tamariki, has been notified. In a statement to the Guardian,
  the bus company, Intercity, said it was aware of an incident involving a
  passenger on one of its services. “Police were called to respond, and they are
  now investigating the matter. No one was harmed during the incident and the
  service resumed,” a spokesperson said. As it was now an active police
  investigation, the company was unable to comment further.
