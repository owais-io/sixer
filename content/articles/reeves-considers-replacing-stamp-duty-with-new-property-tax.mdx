  The Treasury is considering a new tax on the sale of homes worth more than
  £500,000 as a step towards a radical overhaul of stamp duty and council tax,
  the Guardian has been told. As the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares the
  ground for tax rises in this autumn’s budget, senior ministers have tasked
  officials to study how a new “proportional” property tax could be implemented
  and model its impact before reporting back to ministers, who have been briefed
  on the proposals. Officials are initially examining a potential national
  property tax, which would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes, sources
  said. They are also studying whether, after the national tax, a local property
  tax could then replace council tax in the medium term in an effort to repair
  battered local authority finances. No final decisions have been made. A
  national tax could be implemented during this parliament, while it is
  understood an overhaul of council tax would take longer, at least requiring
  Labour to win a second term in office. The policy options are being considered
  as part of a large tranche of work within the Treasury aimed at tapping into
  the vast cumulative rise in house prices in recent years that risks
  entrenching inequalities and making council tax – which is based on early
  1990s property values – more unfair. If the plans came to fruition, they could
  provide valuable political cover for Reeves, both in terms of raising extra
  revenue without breaking Labour’s pledge to not raise levies on working people
  and as policies that would be likely to appeal to many of the party’s MPs and
  members. There has been increasing pressure on the chancellor to consider more
  wealth-based taxes, notably from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and
  the additional tax on more expensive homes could be presented in this light.
  The national tax would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than
  £500,000 when they sell their home. The amount paid would be determined by the
  value of the property, with the rate set by central government, which would
  directly collect the proceeds via HM Revenue and Customs. It would not replace
  stamp duty on second homes. Current rates of stamp duty vary depending on
  whether someone is a first-time buyer and are banded in steps upward depending
  on the value of the property being bought. It would take time to phase in a
  replacement to stamp duty, and a range of options are being considered for
  phasing in changes. The revenue raised by stamp duty on primary residences
  varies considerably from year to year, depending on housing market conditions.
  In the last financial year, it raised £11.6bn, according to government
  figures. Over time, it is believed the new national property tax would be a
  more reliable, consistent source of revenue and ultimately raise the same
  amount as stamp duty. The levy would only affect about a fifth of property
  sales, compared with about 60% with current levels of stamp duty, which is
  paid by the buyer of a home. The average price of a home in the UK was
  £272,664 in July, according to Nationwide. Sources said Treasury officials
  were, in part, drawing on the findings of a 48-page report from the
  centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.
  Onward’s report proposes a dual approach of a national and local “proportional
  property tax” on property, based on its value. It is written by Dr Tim Leunig,
  who worked as a government adviser for more than a decade and was closely
  involved with devising the furlough scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  Leunig wrote: “These proposals would make it easier and cheaper to move house,
  for a better job, or to be near family, as well as being fairer. It should not
  be the case that a terrace house in Burnley pays more than a mansion in
  Kensington – and it wouldn’t be under these proposals.” The government has
  already showed signals of adopting some of the steps towards council tax
  Leunig laid out in his report: “The first step would be to end the overfunding
  of various councils in affluent areas of inner London, particularly
  Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea councils.” This is similar
  to the approach laid out this summer in a consultation on how to redistribute
  from richer to poorer councils. The idea of a new local annual property levy
  to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan would result in
  owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to £500,000 paying
  varying rates of tax dependent on the value of their home. They would pay a
  minimum of £800 a year and the funds this generates would go directly to local
  councils, whose finances have been severely stretched in recent years. Rayner
  has already raised the prospect of ramping up redistributions of funds to
  address regional inequalities, which she has argued are exacerbated by the
  existing council tax system, which replaced the poll tax in 1993. A
  spokesperson for the Treasury said: “As set out in the plan for change, the
  best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy – which is
  our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing
  this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the
  economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn. “We are committed to keeping
  taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s
  budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to
  raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national
  insurance or VAT.” Economists from the right and left of the political
  spectrum have heavily criticised stamp duty and council tax. Stamp duty
  applies in England and Northern Ireland. There are different approaches to
  some land taxes in Wales and Scotland. Council tax banding based on older
  property values is considered flawed and out of date by economists in all
  parts of the UK and is believed to be ripe for reform. In June, the government
  launched a consultation on how to reform the allocation of funds raised by
  council tax. Labour said the “fair funding review” aims to fix the “broken
  funding system we inherited” which has “left local authorities across the
  country in crisis”. The strategy has already met a backlash after it emerged
  deprived inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds. The
  Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic thinktank, has said that while
  reform was very much needed, the proposed changes in the government’s funding
  review appeared to run counter to an “expectation that deprived and urban
  areas would win at the expense of more affluent and rural areas, the
  government’s baseline funding reform proposals are not particularly
  redistributive to poor, urban areas of England”. While any wealth-related tax
  could provoke strong criticism from rightwing opponents, ministers have shown
  willingness to ignore such criticism for policies that generally affect
  wealthier people, such as adding VAT on private school fees and changes to
  inheritance tax for some farms. If billed as a part of a longer-term
  replacement of stamp duty, this could also be helpful given the existing levy
  is unpopular and widely seen as a blunt tool and a block on the property
  market. Using property taxes as a replacement for council tax would be complex
  to implement and almost inevitably require a second term in office, but there
  is an increasing acceptance among all the main parties that the current system
  for local government funding is obsolete and unviable. Labour has already
  committed to the biggest shake-up of council structures in England for decades
  but does not want to oversee the predicted series of local authorities
  declaring effective bankruptcy, especially as many will be run by the party.
  Last week, the Guardian revealed that the Treasury was also looking at ways to
  raise more money from inheritance tax in an attempt to ease pressure on the
  country’s finances, in the run-up to Reeves’s autumn budget.
