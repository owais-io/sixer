  Your Edinburgh festival article (‘It’s a brigade of old gits!’ Miriam
  Margolyes, Andy Linden and the older performers storming Edinburgh, 12 August)
  mentions Miriam Margolyes’ appearance in the 1963 Cambridge Footlights revue.
  I stage-managed that show and have many happy memories of it. The custom was
  that only one girl student would be included in the cast, something Miriam
  fiercely disapproved of. Still etched in my memory is her line as she sashayed
  down to front centre stage: “Here I come, one rose in a bunch of pansies!” It
  was an end-of-an-era moment – the following year there were two girls in the
  cast. Tim Fell Winchester • Nesrine Malik says 10 out of 14 recent posts on X
  by Keir Starmer were about immigration and small-boat arrivals (Here’s the
  truth about Britain’s immigration hysteria: Starmer and co have whipped it up
  to get cheap votes, 11 August). Well, that really cut through to the racist
  mob in Nuneaton on Saturday. They ended their protest by marching through the
  streets chanting “Keir Starmer is a wanker”. Andy Pettit Coventry • Good
  Friday is not a “movable feast” (Letters, 11 August). Yes, it is movable day,
  as the date is set according to the lunar cycle, but it is definitely not a
  feast day. No communion happens. It’s part of the point of the day. Rev Canon
  John Longuet-Higgins Hartpury, Gloucestershire • So Japanese interval walking
  is the latest exercise trend (Japanese interval walking: the viral exercise
  trend that could put a spring in your step, 9 August)? In my younger days, we
  called it “Scouts’ pace” and knew that it was the quickest way to get
  anywhere. Nigel Meredith Dursley, Gloucestershire • Surely Jeremy Corbyn’s new
  party should be called New Old Labour (Letters, 11 August)? David Prothero
  Harlington, Bedfordshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
  publication in our letters section.
