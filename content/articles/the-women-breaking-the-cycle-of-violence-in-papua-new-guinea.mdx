  In a country where violence is often shrouded in silence, Tahina Booth is
  trying to break the cycle with something as simple as passing a ball. The
  former athlete runs programmes aimed at reducing harm to women in some of
  Papua New Guinea’s most dangerous regions. Her story starts with pain. “I was
  raped at age seven,” she says. “That experience shaped the questions that have
  driven my life: why is violence normal? And what would it take to build
  something different – especially for girls growing up in places like mine?” In
  Papua New Guinea, two-thirds of women will experience violence in their
  lifetime. Earlier this year the brutal murders of two women in separate acts
  of extreme violence sparked national outrage and renewed calls for action.
  Leading human rights activist Ruth Kissam says gender-based violence – which
  includes domestic and sexual violence, and killings related to sorcery
  accusations – permeates every level of society. Violence is often not reported
  due to fear of retaliation or a lack of faith in the justice system. “It’s a
  pandemic within our homes and communities,” Kissam says. “The reality is that
  for many women in PNG, violence is a daily experience, not an isolated event.”
  Yet scattered across the country, women like Booth and Kissam are working to
  change mindsets. Booth runs sport-based programmes that teach about
  leadership, gender equality and healthy ways to resolve conflict. Other women
  work in villages at a smaller scale to deal with the impact of violence. Booth
  says she sees change through her programs. “The most powerful thing was
  watching families and elders come and sit on the sidelines … then stay behind,
  asking questions. That tells you something,” she says. “It’s about the village
  beginning to unlearn and relearn, together.” ‘I’ve been through it too’ On the
  north-east coast of Papua New Guinea, in Morobe province, Betty Awo works with
  her community. When women encounter violence, she is often the first person
  they call. Awo is not a police officer or a lawyer, but a mother and a
  survivor. She listens, writes affidavits and counsels couples. Sometimes she
  finds them a place to stay for the night. Awo, who lives in Huon, is part of
  the Morobe Gender-Based Violence Action Committee and is involved with other
  local women’s groups. But mostly she works alone, walking from home to home,
  offering help where she can. “I’ve been through it too,” she says. Awo also
  runs awareness sessions about gender violence and sorcery-related violence,
  going into schools and communities. She says it’s making a difference:
  children now speak up when they see abuse – they tell their parents to stop
  fighting. Village leaders are no longer silent; they call Awo when something
  happens. She doesn’t get paid and there’s no funding. Sometimes she runs out
  of phone credit. She is waiting on a small grant that could help her build a
  safe house. But Awo is hopeful about the difference her work makes. She says
  some broken homes have been rebuilt after her awareness sessions, and people
  are starting to understand the law. “People are changing,” she says. “They
  know violence is wrong.” She believes this work must come from the ground up –
  from people like her, who know their communities and care deeply. “When you
  stand up,” Awo says, “you help others find the courage to stand too.” Hundreds
  of kilometres away in conflict-riven Hela province, Maureen Mokai sees the
  same problems repeated. Here, the local councillor and community leader from
  Tari does her bit to help people struggling with violence. She works with
  dozens of people in what she calls a “peace programme”. Young people, male and
  female, as well as women displaced by violence take part in workshops teaching
  skills, from farming to sewing and ways of healthy living. Mokai says the
  sessions give people a sense of purpose; they build confidence and are better
  able to cope with challenges and conflict. She says this hands-on, practical
  work is changing outlooks in her community. “When they have mental health
  training, their minds change,” Mokai tells the Guardian. She shows small
  groups how to plant and make money for their family. “They have more food.
  They feel that they are changing. That makes them reduce violence. Yes, we
  still live in violence, [but with] my programmes I do community backyard
  change.” ‘Systemic failure’ to protect most vulnerable Papua New Guinea has
  laws to protect women and children – including the Family Protection Act to
  criminalise domestic violence – and provides some legal avenues for victims.
  NGOs and shelters provide some support, while local initiatives such as the
  Haus Krai movement and church-led awareness campaigns have made some progress
  in shifting societal attitudes towards violence. Still, laws are rarely
  enforced, and shelters have severely limited resources. Kissam, who has
  focused on sorcery accusation-related violence, says gender-based violence is
  often considered a private matter, rather than a crime, and that harm to women
  is exacerbated by deeply held cultural norms, weak law enforcement and limited
  support services for survivors. “The violence women and girls endure is not
  just an individual issue but a systemic failure to protect our most
  vulnerable,” she says. As the country prepares to mark 50 years of
  independence, prime minister James Marape has said the moment must be a
  turning point. In March, he described gender-based violence as an “epidemic”
  threatening society. “Why do we turn a blind eye to the suffering of our
  wives, daughters and sisters?” Marape said. “For 50 years we have talked about
  development … about a brighter future for our country. But how can we claim
  success when our women continue to live in fear?” He said the next 50 years
  “must be built on a foundation of respect for women”. Marape and other leaders
  have stressed individuals should act to stop violence. Last month, deputy
  prime minister John Rosso said men must take personal responsibility for
  ending violence against women and children. “We should not only look to the
  government for these solutions. It is each and every male person’s
  responsibility to make certain that we do not perpetrate violence against
  women and children,” Rosso said at an event in Lae in July. Back in Port
  Moresby, Booth is doing what she can to help shift attitudes and behaviour.
  The former elite athlete founded the Grass Skirt Project to address
  gender-based violence. “Sport was where I first learned fairness, voice, and
  confidence. That’s what I’ve built the Grass Skirt Project around.” She
  creates sport-based programmes with coaches, teachers and young people.
  Earlier this year her team led a project in Hela province. “We saw boys
  passing the ball to girls, youth talking about trauma out loud for the first
  time,” she says. After the session, one of the young men who took part said:
  “We used to sit and plan fights. Now we sit and plan games.” Booth connects
  survivors with referral services and coaches are trained in working with
  trauma. She says her work creates “spaces where people feel safe to speak”.
  She has an ambitious goal of reaching 1 million young people through her
  programmes by 2050. Challenges remain and the emotional toll is heavy – but
  Booth says the work is making a difference. “We want a PNG where girls can
  play, boys can cry. I’ve lived the realities we’re trying to shift.” Booth
  says women like Kissam and others across Papua New Guinea are “doing bold
  work” and together they are looking at how to “build a stronger front”. She
  hopes more women will join and help make a difference. “Start where you are.
  We need you now.”
