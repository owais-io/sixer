  Caroline Alcorso’s first protests were with her family on Tasmania’s Franklin
  River in 1982 – blockades against the damming of the waterways that grew into
  Australia’s Greens movement. She was also on the Sydney Harbour Bridge last
  Sunday, marching alongside an estimated 225,000 to 300,000 others to call for
  an end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, and says the collective mood reminded her
  of those times on the river. Hall Greenland was also there. The 81-year-old
  former Greens candidate, who was part of the anti-Vietnam war movement and
  attended the Freedom Rides, says the protest “was a return to the spirit of
  the 60s and 70s”. “It was the biggest and most exhilarating [march] that I’ve
  been on,” he says. “It was just the full spectrum … of Australian society. The
  young and the old … It was inspiring.” Alcorso, who is a current Greens
  member, says it’s political rather than social attitudes to protest that have
  changed in Australia in recent decades – supported by “appalling” media
  coverage. “We don’t have alternative views in the main political parties any
  more,” she says, recalling the Labor party’s response to the Franklin protests
  and support for protecting the river. In recent years, New South Wales has led
  the pack in introducing what Greenland calls “authoritarian” anti-protest
  laws, including giving police broad discretion to penalise people disrupting
  major roads or infrastructure. Other states have rolled out a suite of similar
  laws. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The backlash against
  ‘kneejerk law-making’ Protest in Australia is broadly lawful, with the
  constitution holding the implied right to freedom of political communication.
  Yet a report released by the Human Rights Law Centre last year found at least
  49 laws enacted by governments that have constricted the right to protest over
  the past 20 years. In Queensland, protesters who disrupt mining equipment can
  face one year in prison. South Australia has fines of up to $50,000 and three
  months in prison for obstructing a public place – laws introduced in 2023 only
  days after an Extinction Rebellion demonstration. NSW has enacted the highest
  number of anti-protest laws of any state, according to the report. In 2022, in
  response to blockades at Port Botany by climate group Blockade Australia, the
  state introduced harsh anti-protest laws that can see protesters face a
  maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment and $22,000 in fines for blocking
  major facilities. “This kneejerk law-making is catching up to the government
  because it leads to poorly justified, sometimes unconstitutional legislation –
  and that unites a broad church of actors against it,” says Anastasia
  Radievska, a protest rights campaigner with the Australian Democracy Network.
  In 2023, after a legal challenge by the “knitting nannas”, the NSW supreme
  court knocked back sections of the anti-protest laws introduced by the former
  Liberal government because they infringed on the implied freedom of political
  communication. Laws passed under the current Labor government also give police
  powers to issue move-on orders to protestors “in or near” places of worship,
  regardless of what the protest is about. In Victoria, there have been
  discussions about whether to introduce a permit system like in NSW, where
  organisations can submit a “Form 1” notice to police. But this is now
  considered unlikely after the state’s new police chief said there was no need
  for such a system. Permit regimes are increasingly operating as a de facto
  “authorisation” system, according to the Grata Fund and Australian Democracy
  Network’s In Defence of Dissent report. Maria O’Sullivan, an expert in protest
  law at Deakin University, says the “to and fro” of court proceedings around
  protest permits created significant challenges. She points to the Sydney “Stop
  All Black Deaths in Custody” march in 2020, which was opposed by police and
  was only declared an authorised public assembly after a last-minute decision
  by the court of appeal. “It’s not ideal for protesters to have to go to court
  to protect their … right to freedom of assembly,” she says. “Significantly,
  [those] protesting about police violence and deaths in custody had to
  negotiate with the police in order to have the protest.” There are also
  growing concerns about the jailing of protesters in Australia, as well as
  onerous bail conditions. Between 2019 and 2024, according to the In Defence of
  Dissent report, “64 peaceful protesters in NSW were subject to police bail
  conditions that ban them from associating with either members of a specific
  protest group or ‘issue motivated groups’ generally”. Former Greens candidate
  Hannah Thomas was hospitalised in June after being arrested by police at a
  Palestine protest and faces losing vision in one eye. She claimed the new NSW
  laws had “emboldened” the police in interactions with protesters. How the
  court sided with the protesters It was touch and go whether the Sunday Sydney
  Harbour Bridge protest would go ahead with legal protections. Organisers the
  Palestine Action Group (PAG) applied to police a week out for legal
  protections and support facilitating what they then estimated to be a protest
  attended by 10,000 people. The police sought an order in the NSW supreme court
  prohibiting the public assembly. Lawyers for the police argued there were
  major public safety concerns, including the risk of crowd crush. Felicity
  Graham, who acted for PAG, argued tens of thousands of people would turn up
  regardless of whether it was authorised or not. Just over 24 hours before the
  protest was due to start, the court sided with the protesters. In the
  judgment, Justice Belinda Rigg said disruption and inconvenience alone were
  not enough to stifle the right to political protest and noted “significant
  support for the march” from Amnesty International, trade unions and members of
  parliament. Amal Naser, an organiser with Palestine Action Group, says in her
  experience, how NSW police interact with the near-weekly protest is often
  shaped by the government’s views on the protest. She says police usually help
  facilitate an “orderly and peaceful” march, but when political pressure
  increased, “there was increased pressure from police”. The ‘people’s will’
  Naser thinks Sunday’s protest will have positive flow-on effects for the right
  to protest, and that its scale made it almost impossible for the police to
  enforce the anti-protests laws. “The precedent that was formed in this case
  showed that the court does respect the right to protest,” she says. “Our rally
  effectively undermined a large aspect of the anti-protest regime … because we
  were able to get this Form 1 through the courts. No matter what amount of
  legislation you throw at us, there is enough stamina among the masses to
  challenge these undemocratic practices.” It seemed possible the bridge march,
  which made global headlines, could turn the political tide in NSW – both on
  attitudes to protest and on Gaza. On Tuesday, members of the right and some of
  the left Labor faction attempted to move a motion endorsing the right to
  protest and condemning the destruction of Gaza and the “Israeli government’s
  endorsement of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the territory”. The Labor
  premier, Chris Minns, stared down the revolt, with caucus agreeing to a more
  moderate motion that recognised the scale of Sunday’s protest. But tensions
  are still simmering within the party over Minns’ handling of the protest, with
  member of the left faction Anthony D’Adam delivering a fiery speech to
  parliament on Thursday night. He accused the premier and the caucus of gagging
  and bullying him, and “stultifying the internal culture of the party”. Naser
  says Sunday’s protest means politicians can no longer ignore public sentiment.
  “Politicians have definitely now seen that the … people’s will is demanding
  action on Gaza,” she says. “The Albanese government should reflect on the
  failures of the Howard government in response to the Iraq war protests, and
  reflect on whether or not 10 or 20 years from now, they want to be looked at
  as a government who did not … listen to the will of a people.” • Do you know
