  Large parts of coastal New South Wales are braced for a weekend of wild
  weather similar to the coastal low that struck the state earlier this month,
  according to Bureau of Meteorology forecasts. A low system forming off the
  north coast of NSW could bring widespread rain and strong winds from the
  Hunter region across Sydney to the Illawarra, beginning on Friday night and
  into Saturday. Sydney residents woke up to a wet Wednesday, with cold
  temperatures and widespread areas of rain expected around central and eastern
  NSW. The rain is expected to continue for days before the low is forecast to
  develop and rapidly deepen, bringing rain and driving large waves into coastal
  areas. The BoM meteorologist Jiwon Park said it was still too early to say
  which areas could be worst hit or how bad the weather could get. But such
  systems typically bring “impactful weather in terms of the wind and the rain
  and surf conditions”, Park said. Moderate to heavy rainfall could cause flash
  flooding in some areas, he said. “We may well be issuing severe weather
  warnings for heavy rain, damaging winds and hazardous coastal conditions”, BoM
  senior meteorologist Christie Johnson added in a briefing on Wednesday
  morning. “This is a dynamic weather event; forecasts are likely to change
  before the weekend as we get more information about the position of that low.”
  The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) on Tuesday warned residents to be
  prepared for extreme weather and heavy rainfall. Daily rain totalling 50-100mm
  could hit parts of the Hunter, the Central Coast and Sydney metro area. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email Nicole Hogan, the assistant commissioner of the
  SES, urged residents to monitor weather alerts and prepare a response plan
  should they be affected by severe weather. “That means planning what you will
  do and where you will go if you are impacted by severe weather,” Hogan said.
  “We ask everyone to stay informed by downloading the Hazards Near Me app and
  setting up a watch zone for their area, so you are alerted with the latest
  warnings and advice.” Hogan noted that many catchments across the state were
  still wet from recent weather events and may respond “quickly” to rainfall,
  creating dangerous situations. “Flash flooding and renewed river rises are
  possible with the forecast rainfall,” she said. Park said models showed a peak
  period of rainfall on Saturday with damaging winds up to 60km/h and gale-force
  gusts up to 90km/h along the coastal fringes. As soon as the low-pressure
  system makes landfall, the bureau forecast a secondary low-pressure system
  would head towards the north coast of NSW on Sunday. That system was forecast
  to affect areas north of Port Macquarie or Nambucca Heads, although Park said
  the main risks on Sunday would be strong winds and intense surf with the
  potential for coastal erosion. “The high-impact areas may be subjected to
  change, as we get a clearer idea of what this system will do toward the
  weekend,” Park said. “There is a potential for such an event and that’s why
  SES has issued these warnings pre-emptively.” The BoM was also warning snow
  was possible above 1,000 metres in the central and northern ranges in the
  coming days due to the low-pressure system. NSW SES officials said those
  conditions could cause some disruptions to transport routes due to icy roads
  outside the usual alpine regions. A powerful storm pummelled parts of NSW
  earlier this month, leaving tens of thousands without power, and the SES
  responded to more than 1,300 calls in a 24-hour period.
