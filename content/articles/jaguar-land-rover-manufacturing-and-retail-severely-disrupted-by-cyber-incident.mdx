  Jaguar Land Rover’s manufacturing and retailing activities have been “severely
  disrupted” by a cyber incident, forcing it to shut down its systems. Britain’s
  largest carmaker said there was no evidence that any customer data had been
  taken. “We are now working at pace to restart our global applications in a
  controlled manner,” JLR said in a brief statement. “At this stage there is no
  evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production
  activities have been severely disrupted.” JLR said it had “proactively” shut
  down its systems and taken “immediate action to mitigate” the impact. The
  Liverpool Echo reported that workers at the company’s Halewood plant in
  Merseyside were told early on Monday morning not to come into work because of
  the incident. Shares in JLR’s Indian owner, Tata Motors, fell by 0.9% in
  Mumbai after it informed investors of a cyber incident on Monday. JLR told its
  parent company that it was “working at pace to resolve global IT issues
  impacting our business”. One cybersecurity specialist said the speed of the
  shutdown underlined the seriousness of the threat facing JLR’s operations.
  “JLR’s decision to proactively shut down global manufacturing suggests this
  attack may have been targeting their operational systems, not just customer
  data,” said Oakley Cox, a director at the UK cybersecurity firm Darktrace.
  “The speed of their response is telling – you don’t typically halt production
  across multiple sites unless there’s genuine concern about operational
  impact.” JLR did not give more details about who was behind the cyber
  incident, when it was discovered or how long it would take to recover from it.
  The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre was contacted for comment. In April,
  Marks &amp; Spencer revealed it had been the victim of a devastating
  cyber-attack which resulted in the closure of its online store for almost
  seven weeks and cost it hundreds of millions of pounds. The Co-op was attacked
  in the same month and forced to shut down parts of its IT system. Both had
  been targeted by ransomware, which locks up a victim’s computer files. JLR has
  given no indication that its incident also involves such malware. In May, the
  luxury retailer Harrods said that it had been targeted, and restricted
  internet access across its websites after attempts to gain unauthorised access
  to its system. Four people including three teenagers have been arrested at UK
  addresses as part of an investigation into the trio of retail cyber-attacks.
  The disruption at JLR comes as it faces falling profits amid the impact of US
  tariffs and declining sales. The carmaker reported that underlying pre-tax
  profits fell by 49% to £351m in the three months to June, which included a
  period when the company temporarily paused exports to the US. A subsequent
  trade deal between the UK and the US cut car export tariffs from 27.5% to 10%.
  However, the pause contributed to a near £700m drop in revenue, down 9.2% year
  on year to £6.6bn. The incident comes during one of the busiest weeks for car
  retailers, with UK dealerships selling their first 75-plate vehicles. Autocar
  reported that JLR dealers had been unable to register cars with the new plate.
  JLR also said in July that it had to delay the planned launches of its new
  electric Range Rover and electric Jaguar models until 2026, after initially
  aiming for late 2025. The company told staff over the summer that it would axe
  up to 500 management jobs in the UK as part of a voluntary redundancy round.
  JLR, which is headquartered in Coventry, employs 32,800 people in the UK
  across 17 different sites. Last month it announced PB Balaji would become its
  new chief executive and would take the reins in November. Balaji, who is the
  group finance chief of Tata Motors, will become the British carmaker’s first
  Indian chief executive. He will replace Adrian Mardell, who is retiring after
  three years in the top job and 35 years working for the company. More than one
  in four UK businesses had been the victim of a cyber-attack in the past year
  and many more risked “sleepwalking” into such disruption unless they took
  urgent action, according to a survey of facilities managers, service providers
  and consultancies undertaken by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
  (Rics).
