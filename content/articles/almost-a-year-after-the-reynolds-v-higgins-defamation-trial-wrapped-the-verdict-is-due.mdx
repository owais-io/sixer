  Almost a year after the five-week defamation trial between Linda Reynolds and
  her former staffer Brittany Higgins wrapped up, a Western Australian supreme
  court judge is due to hand down his verdict. The judge will weigh up the five
  weeks of evidence presented over August and September 2024, to determine
  whether Higgins defamed Reynolds, formerly a federal WA Liberal senator, in
  social media posts in 2022 and 2023. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The court
  heard evidence spanning the five-year period from when Higgins was allegedly
  raped by Bruce Lehrmann in 2019 in Reynolds’ ministerial office to the week of
  the trial in Perth. Lehrmann pleaded not guilty before his criminal trial
  collapsed due to juror misconduct. Then in April 2024 Justice Michael Lee
  found in a separate defamation trial – launched by Lehrmann – that on the
  balance of probabilities he had raped Higgins. Lehrmann is awaiting the ruling
  on his appeal against that decision. Here’s a refresher on the Reynolds v
  Higgins case to bring you back up to speed. Why is Linda Reynolds suing
  Brittany Higgins? In July 2023 Higgins wrote “It is time to stop” in an
  Instagram story that featured a news story reporting Reynolds’ intention to
  refer Higgins’s $2.445m compensation for personal injury from the federal
  government to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Higgins’s story
  continued accusing Reynolds of harassing her in the media and in parliament.
  Two days later, Higgins tweeted: “I’ve just received a concerns notice from
  [Linda Reynolds] threatening defamation over an Instagram story. I’m
  considering my legal options.” Reynolds then threatened to take Higgins to
  court over the social media posts, saying she had “had enough”. In August she
  followed through on that threat, filing a writ. Court documents show that
  Reynolds alleged Higgins’s posts were in breach of a settlement and release
  signed in March 2021. That settlement allegedly contained a non-disparagement
  clause. The two parties were unable to resolve the conflict through mediation
  and the case ultimately went to court in August 2024. What did we hear in
  court? The majority of it came from Reynolds herself and witnesses she called.
  Higgins, on the other hand, did not appear, and her defence was provided
  solely through her lawyer, Rachael Young SC. Higgins, Young told the court,
  had tried to effect change in Parliament House by publicly sharing her alleged
  rape in stories on news.com.au and The Project in 2021. In those interviews,
  Higgins claimed that her alleged sexual assault became a political “problem”
  for Reynolds, her then boss, as well as the wider Morrison government.
  Reynolds, however, disputed that claim, saying she had been supportive of
  Higgins, and that Higgins’s claim of a political cover-up was a lie that
  damaged Reynolds’ physical and mental health. Both parties claimed the other
  had harassed them through the media and via their political opponents over a
  three- to four-year period after Higgins’s allegations against Lehrmann became
  public, along with secondary allegations against Reynolds, that she had not
  taken adequate care of Higgins. Reynolds told the court the continued
  criticisms from Higgins and her now husband, David Sharaz, had made her feel
  like a “punching clown”. She claimed the couple’s social media posts worked
  like a press release machine, generating critical headlines about her. In the
  trial, Young countered that Higgins felt she was the victim of continued
  harassment by Reynolds, and offered three examples: when Reynolds called
  Higgins a “lying cow”, which was later leaked to the media; Reynolds’ texts
  with Lehrmann’s then barrister, Steven Whybrow, which gave an “impression” she
  was biased against Higgins; and Reynolds’ decision to leak confidential
  documents to Janet Albrechtsen, a columnist critical of Higgins at The
  Australian. How much is at stake? That’s for the judge to decide but the court
  heard last September how much Reynolds’ team is hoping for. The former
  senator’s lawyer, Martin Bennett, said Reynolds should receive a “substantial”
  payout along with a permanent injunction to prevent Higgins from making any
  further disparaging remarks. Bennett argued that without awards “in excess” of
  the statutory maximum – which in WA is $500,000 as of 1 July – Higgins would
  continue to pursue “her truth” through a book deal, and possible movie or
  television deals. Higgins’s lawyer, on the other hand, said any damages
  awarded to Reynolds if she won should be assessed by “how far her reputation
  has fallen” since mid-2023 when the tweets were posted, not since the
  allegations against Lehrmann and Reynolds first publicly aired in February
  2021. Young referred to defamation cases with far smaller payouts, such as
  when Peter Dutton sued a refugee advocate for calling him a “rape apologist”
  and was awarded $35,000 before the case was overturned on appeal. Bennett,
  however, referred to other cases with payouts at the half million-dollar mark.
  Is this Reynolds’ final case connected to the rape? In a word, no. The Nacc
  found “no corruption” in June 2025 after investigating Reynolds’ referral of
  the personal injury settlement. It concluded that the former attorney general
  Mark Dreyfus had “no inappropriate intervention” when he approved Higgins’s
  settlement in December 2022 without the involvement of Reynolds and her legal
  team. Reynolds has separately taken the issue to the federal court, alleging
  that Dreyfus had a conflict of interest when he signed the settlement.
  Documents released to the WA supreme court last year showed Reynolds was asked
  by government solicitors not to attend the mediation with Higgins in December
  2022 or make any public commentary about Higgins. The documents said this was
  to maintain the confidentiality of information related to the settlement and
  civil claims to give the commonwealth the “best position to achieve a
  resolution at the mediation”. Reynolds is suing the commonwealth and its
  lawyers for damages and legal costs in an effort to “vindicate and restore her
  reputation”, the statement of claim said. • This article was amended on 27
  August 2025 to clarify that the social media posts relating to Linda Reynolds
  were published in 2022 and 2023. Initially the article stated the posts were
  published in 2023.
