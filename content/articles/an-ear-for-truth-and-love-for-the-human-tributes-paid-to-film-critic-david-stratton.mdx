  Legendary film critic David Stratton has been remembered for his “incredible
  insight”, “humility” and “deep love of cinema” in tributes after his death at
  age 85. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Stratton had shared his
  love of cinema with the entire nation while co-hosting the television programs
  The Movie Show and At The Movies with fellow critic Margaret Pomeranz. “All of
  us who tuned in to At the Movies respected him for his deep knowledge and for
  the gentle and generous way he passed it on,” Albanese said. “We loved his wit
  and his sharp insight, and the deep love of cinema that underpinned it all.
  And in his chemistry with Margaret Pomeranz, he helped deliver one of
  Australia’s truly great TV partnerships.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  minister arts minister, Tony Burke, said he was deeply saddened by Stratton’s
  death and that “his love of film shone through” during this life. “You would
  see a movie because David told you to. Countless stories reached countless
  Australians because of David,” Burke said. “We saw more, learned more, felt
  more, laughed more and cried more because David shared his love of screen with
  us.” The ABC’s managing director, Hugh Marks, said Stratton had made an
  enormous contribution to the public broadcaster during his decades on screen.
  “Incredible insight, a love of the craft of moviemaking and a respect for his
  audience, David was a credit to our industry,” Marks said. “We are thinking of
  his family and friends at this time.” The SBS managing director, James Taylor,
  said the broadcaster was “deeply saddened” by Stratton’s death and credited
  his work co-hosting The Movie Show between 1986 and 2004 for “introducing
  generations of viewers to cinema from Australia and around the world. His
  legacy endures in every thoughtful review and every inspired viewer.” Actor
  Rachel Griffiths told the ABC that Stratton was a “a champion of Australian
  stories”. “He was gentle in manner and had a curiosity that I’ve found rare in
  my career,” she said. “Most notably, he was humble – never putting himself as
  the overlord of the creative – but as a servant to creativity. “He had an ear
  for truth and a love for the human, and knew almost instantly when a new
  talent had announced itself.” The Melbourne international film festival said
  Stratton’s “deep passion for cinema and his lifelong commitment to championing
  Australian film brought countless stories to audiences and inspired
  generations”. The Sydney film festival said Stratton’s achievements were “too
  innumerable to list in totality” but would include “his successful fight
  against censorship of films in Australia”. It also praised his “support for
  emerging film-makers from Australia and around the world” and for “fostering
  of a brave and adventurous cinema culture in Australian audiences”. In a
  statement, Screen Australia said Stratton was “a champion of Australian voices
  and stories on screen. “His passion for cinema and support for the local
  screen industry will be long felt and never forgotten.”
