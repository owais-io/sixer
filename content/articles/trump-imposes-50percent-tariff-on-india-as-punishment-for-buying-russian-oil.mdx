  Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on most US imports from India, making good on
  a threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies over its purchases of
  discounted Russian oil. The tariffs, which came into effect just after
  midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk inflicting significant damage on the
  Indian economy and further disrupting global supply chains. US tariffs of 25%
  on Indian goods went into force earlier this month, but Trump announced plans
  to double the rate, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, which the
  White House has argued is indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine. The
  US president has significantly increased US tariffs on goods from much of the
  world since reentering the White House in January, straining relations with
  economies of allies and rivals and fueling fears of higher inflation. This
  latest move leaves Indian exporters facing among the highest US duties Trump
  has slapped on goods from overseas. Brazil is also grappling with 50% tariffs
  on its exports to the US. Ministers in India argue it has been unjustly
  singled out for its trade relationship with Russia and officials caution the
  country will likely work more closely with Moscow and Beijing – and drift
  further from Washington – as a result. Most Indian goods exports to the US
  (worth $87.3bn to the US last year, according to the US trade representative)
  now face steep duties, although some key products including smartphones are
  set to be spared, for now. The action, confirmed in a notice by the US
  Homeland Security Department earlier this week, prompted some economists to
  predict a precipitous fall in trade between the two countries. “I don’t care
  what India does with Russia,” Trump claimed on Truth Social, his social
  network, last month. “They can take their dead economies down together, for
  all I care.” In India, the mood has been defiant. The country’s government has
  refused to halt purchases of Russian oil, and prime minister Narendra Modi
  urged Indians to buy local. “All of us should follow the mantra of buying only
  ‘Made in India’ goods,” Modi said on Tuesday, encouraging shopkeepers to
  display big signs promoting domestic products. “Pressure on us may increase
  [from the tariffs], but we will bear it,” he added. Goldman Sachs’ chief India
  economist, Santanu Sengupta, warned that sustained 50% levies could push gross
  domestic product (GDP) growth below 6%, from a forecast level of around 6.5%.
  Rival exporters from Turkey to Thailand, facing lower US tariffs, are already
  scooping up American buyers with offers of cheaper goods. About 30% of India’s
  exports to the US – including pharmaceuticals, electronics, raw drug materials
  and refined fuels – worth $27.6bn, remain duty-free. But sectors like
  textiles, gems and jewellery, and seafood, long reliant on the American
  market, face shrinking order books. “At a 50% tariff, it is very difficult to
  export,” Sengupta said. The effects are already visible. The Federation of
  Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) reported textile and apparel manufacturers
  in Tirupur, Delhi, and Surat had already halted production due to “worsening
  cost competitiveness”. “Indian goods have been rendered uncompetitive compared
  to competitors from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, and other
  south-east and south Asian countries,” said FIEO president SC Ralhan. Indian
  shares tumbled ahead of the tariffs, with the benchmark BSE Sensex dropping
  1%, or 849 points, to 80,876 in Mumbai on Tuesday. The US, India’s largest
  export market, accounts for nearly a third of shipments in key sectors such as
  gems, jewellery and textiles, highlighting the potential economic impact. Even
  if the tariff row eases, trust in future relations with Washington is probably
  the biggest casualty. “Trump has blown it. The hard work between the two
  countries, which inherently did not trust each other but still managed to
  build a solid strategic relationship, is now at risk,” said a senior Indian
  trade official, who requested anonymity. “It is going to take a long time to
  reboot, and it probably won’t happen until Trump is out.” “At a working level,
  the countries must cooperate, but politically, neither can afford to appear
  weak,” the official added. S Jaishankar, the external affairs minister, called
  Washington’s demand that New Delhi stop buying Russian crude “unjustified and
  unreasonable” and accused the west of hypocrisy, noting that Europe trades far
  more with Russia. To avoid the extra US tariff, India would have to replace
  about 42% of its oil imports. While Trump has accused India of indirectly
  funding Russia’s war against Ukraine through its purchases of Kremlin crude,
  he has not taken similar action against China, another major purchaser. He has
  also sought to diffuse tensions with Moscow, inviting the Russian president
  Vladimir Putin to Alaska for a summit earlier this month and even mooting a
  trilateral meeting with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of
  efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Despite tensions, Jaishankar said
  US-India trade talks continue. “We are two big countries, we need to have
  conversations … the lines are not cut,” he said. Earlier hopes for a trade
  deal capping tariffs at 15% were dashed after India refused to open its
  agriculture market to US farm goods for fear of harming the country’s poor
  farmers. India has pivoted toward Russia, which it calls an “all-weather
  friend”, and Jaishankar travelled to Moscow recently to meet Putin, who is
  expected to visit New Delhi later this year. Modi will also make his first
  trip to China in seven years to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
  summit, aiming to stabilise relations after a deadly 2020 Himalayan clash put
  ties into a deep freeze. “India will tiptoe toward China, but not in a full
  embrace. There is a trust factor from the past with China, and much history to
  reconcile, but the reality is that India must do business with China,” said
  another senior Indian official, who also asked not to be named. “The current
  [Trump] administration may set a record for the highest number of own goals
  with a top bilateral partner over such a short period of time,” said veteran
  South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.
