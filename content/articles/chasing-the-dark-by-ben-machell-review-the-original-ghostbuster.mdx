  My first and only experience with a Ouija board occurred when I was 11, at a
  friend’s house. It was good, spooky fun until it wasn’t. I recall movement and
  the start of a message before we recoiled from the board. Later that evening,
  I learned that my grandfather had died. While I realise now that a boy with a
  terminally ill relative and a lurid imagination was not the most reliable
  witness, I remember wanting to believe that I’d had a brush with the uncanny.
  When Times journalist Ben Machell’s dying grandmother bequeathed him a crystal
  ball, he began idly searching for mediums and happened across the work of a
  man named Tony Cornell. Between 1952 and 2004, Cornell worked (unpaid and to
  the detriment of two marriages) for the Society for Psychical Research (SPR).
  Weeding out deception and delusion from accounts of paranormal activity to
  find out what, if anything, remained, Britain’s most diligent parapsychologist
  was more claims adjuster than ghostbuster. His answering machine filled up
  with pleas to investigate strange happenings around the country: a trawlerman
  mauled by an invisible hound, a house that bled water, a rural bungalow
  plagued by fires and expiring pets. Machell has honoured Cornell with an
  entrancing biography. Drawing on boxes of tapes and documents, an unpublished
  memoir and interviews with relatives and contemporaries, he hears “the steady
  voice of a rational man methodically tapping the wall between reality and
  something else”. Cornell’s approach was approvingly described as
  “probing-doubt”: curious without being credulous, sensitive yet rigorous. In
  1977, he clashed with two SPR colleagues over the infamous Enfield
  poltergeist: a hoax, he decided, but they got a bestselling book out of it
  while Cornell’s work, Machell writes, was largely “unheralded, unrewarded and
  appreciated only by a small group of people”. Machell’s elegantly thrilling
  yarn encompasses the broad history of paranormal research in the UK. In the
  middle of the 19th century, the tension between science and religion inspired
  a craze for “proof” of life after death in the form of spiritualism – seances,
  clairvoyants, automatic writing – and a subsequent desire to assess its
  veracity. The SPR was founded in 1882, in a “spirit of exact and unimpassioned
  inquiry”. Its members, including Lewis Carroll, future prime minister Arthur
  Balfour and psychologist William James, pioneered concepts such as telepathy
  and ectoplasm while exposing fraudulent mediums and “spirit photographers”.
  The SPR proved so adept at debunking charlatans that Arthur Conan Doyle led a
  mass exodus of aggrieved spiritualists in 1930. The author’s nemesis was the
  American researcher JB Rhine, whose new field of parapsychology focused on
  psychic phenomena rather than the spirit realm. A poltergeist, for example,
  might actually be “recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis” – the violent
  discharge of mental energy by the living. Rhine’s secular approach appealed to
  Soviet materialists, who explored telepathy as a potential cold war weapon.
  The physiologist Leonid Vasiliev, whom Tony Cornell visited in Leningrad in
  1962, possibly at the behest of MI6, claimed that explaining extrasensory
  perception would be as significant as discovering atomic energy. The more
  concepts such as telekinesis excited the public, though, the more uneasy the
  group’s rationalist wing became. In the 1970s, the decade of Uri Geller and
  Stephen King’s Carrie, Cornell’s mentor Eric Dingwall snapped and repudiated
  parapsychology for feeding a “new occultism”. Yet Cornell persisted. Even as
  he exposed numerous instances of mischief, attention-seeking and
  hallucination, he personally encountered a handful of phenomena that defied
  rational explanation. It was a mind-boggling experience in postwar India, too
  good to spoil here, that set him on this path in the first place. He still
  sought answers. During the 1990s, to his surprise, Cornell’s answering machine
  fell silent. He wondered whether conspiracy theories had supplanted the
  paranormal in the public imagination, or perhaps digital distractions had
  dulled our receptivity to psychic disturbances. But had he not died in 2010,
  he would have seen a new generation of ghost hunters do a roaring trade on
  YouTube, where there is no financial incentive for his brand of cautious
  analysis. As Dingwall feared, entertainment has trumped genuine investigation.
  Like many a biographer, Machell falls half in love with his subject. Cornell
  was respected within the SPR for his diplomacy and his “consistent willingness
  to be wrong”. Parapsychology may not be widely accepted as a branch of
  science, but Cornell had a true scientist’s commitment to doubt and
  impartiality. At a time when beliefs leave facts in the dust, it’s easy to
  share Machell’s admiration for a man who was willing to say: “I don’t know.” •
