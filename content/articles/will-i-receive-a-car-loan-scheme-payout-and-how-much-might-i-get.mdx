  Millions of people are in line for payouts after the City regulator announced
  on Sunday that it would launch a compensation scheme for people affected by
  the car finance scandal. Here we explain who might be eligible, how much they
  might receive, and what they need to do. Why is this happening now? On Friday,
  the supreme court largely overturned last October’s court of appeal ruling on
  car finance that could have led to compensation payouts of up to £44bn. The
  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set out its plans for a redress scheme 48
  hours later, saying it would consult on a scheme covering loans dating back to
  2007, with estimates putting the total cost to lenders at between £9bn and
  £18bn. Why is there a redress scheme when justices mostly backed lenders? It’s
  partly because the FCA has been running its own investigation into so-called
  discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), a particularly controversial
  type of car finance. With these deals, motor finance lenders – typically banks
  – gave dealers the power to set interest rates on car loans, with dealers
  getting more commission the higher the interest rate. This practice, which
  allegedly incentivised dealers to overcharge customers, was banned by the FCA
  in 2021. Given the regulator’s concern, it was always likely that many DCA
  cases were going to be in line for compensation; about 14.6m contracts
  included this arrangement between 2007 and 2020. The FCA is proposing that the
  compensation scheme covers DCAs “if they were not properly disclosed”, –
  believed to be the case for the vast majority of the loans. However, the
  supreme court also upheld one of the three test cases on Friday – not a DCA
  case – deeming it “unfair”. This was due to the size of the commission paid to
  the car dealer – a particularly large 55% of the total cost of the credit (in
  other words, the interest and fees) – and a failure to explain the structure
  of the deal clearly enough in documents provided to the customer. The FCA said
  that that court decision “makes clear that non-disclosure of other facts
  relating to the commission can make the relationship unfair”. Many people,
  therefore, who signed car finance deals between 2007 and 2024 whose agreement
  did not include a DCA may still be in line for a payout if there are unfair
  elements. However, this potential payout will depend on the facts of each
  case. Clearly a large commission could be a factor, some will depend on how
  financially literate the borrower was when they signed the contract, and how
  much information was provided to them. I think I’ve been affected, how do I
  get my money? The regulator will start consulting on the scheme by early
  October. The consultation is due to take six weeks and the FCA aims to
  finalise the scheme “in time for people to start receiving compensation next
  year”. People who have already complained do not need to do anything as they
  should be “in the system”. For the rest, the FCA says: “Consumers concerned
  they were not told about commission and who think they may have paid too much
  for the finance should complain now.” The MoneySavingExpert website has free
  tools that create an email for you to send to the relevant lender based on
  your answers to a few key questions. Or you can complain yourself. It is free
  and simple, the FCA says. You will need to complain to the company you were
  paying each month, and ideally do it in writing. Complaining now gives the
  company concerned a chance to track down your information, and if there is a
  problem it is probably better to know now rather than later. Should I use a
  claims firm? The short answer? No. Claims management companies and consumer
  law firms have been touting for business for some time, and appear to be
  ramping up their efforts to encourage people who may have lost out to sign up.
  But the FCA and Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) are concerned that some
  firms are not telling consumers about free alternatives, are making bold and
  sometimes misleading claims about payouts, and are charging fees worth up to
  30% of any compensation. Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said: “Our
  aim is a compensation scheme that’s fair and easy to participate in, so
  there’s no need to use a claims management company or law firm. If you do, it
  will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.” How much money might
  I get? The FCA estimates “most individuals will probably receive less than
  £950 in compensation”. It has said previously that in the case of loan
  agreements that included a DCA, consumers may have been overcharged by £1,100,
  as a result of paying too much interest on a typical £10,000, four-year car
  finance deal. Some claims law firms have said some clients were charged much
  more, amounting to several thousand pounds in hidden commission. Also, because
  the FCA thinks that the scheme should cover agreements dating back to 2007,
  there will be people who bought several cars during this period, who may be
  entitled to multiple payouts. However, the FCA has indicated that it would
  need to balance the interests of consumers, firms and the broader economy when
  setting up a scheme. Presumably, that may mean people might not get back all
  of their “loss”. That said, any amount people get is likely to be boosted by
  interest, which could add up to a reasonable amount if it is several years’
  worth. The FCA said it planned to consult on an interest rate for each year of
  the scheme based on the average Bank of England base rate that year, plus 1%.
  “This would be in the ballpark of a simple [ie, not compound] interest rate of
  3% per annum,” it said. Will there still be records of my car loan after all
  this time? Yes, this is a concern, as it is thought that most banks typically
  purge customer data after six years. The FCA ordered firms to stop deleting
  car finance documents when it launched its initial investigation in January
  last year. But the files relating to customers with contracts that ended more
  than six years earlier may have already been lost. The Financing and Leasing
  Association, which represents leading car loan providers, said: “We have
  concerns about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes
  back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information,
  and the evidence base will be patchy at best. We will be interested to see how
  the FCA addresses this point in its consultation.” However, many people will
  have kept their paperwork. During the payment protection insurance (PPI)
  scandal, banks were urged to err on the side of consumers, even when there was
  no documentation, but it is not yet clear if this will happen with car loans.
