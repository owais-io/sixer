  have bled’

  Guards at Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail deployed teargas and
  engaged in a mass beating of detainees to quell a mini-uprising, it was
  reported on Friday. The allegations, made by at least three detainees in phone
  calls to Miami’s Spanish language news channel Noticias 23, come as
  authorities race to empty the camp in compliance with a judge’s order to close
  the remote tented camp in the Everglades wetlands. The incident took place
  after several migrants held there began shouting for “freedom” after one
  received news a relative had died, according to the outlet. A team of guards
  then rushed in and began beating individuals indiscriminately with batons, and
  fired teargas at them, the detainees said. “They’ve beaten everyone here, a
  lot of people have bled. Brother, teargas. We are immigrants, we are not
  criminals, we are not murderers,” one of the men reportedly told Noticias 23
  in a call. The detainees claimed a fire alarm was sounding continuously, and a
  helicopter was heard circling overhead. Reports of “inhumane” conditions and
  brutality at the camp, where migrants are held in metal cages as they await
  deportation, have become commonplace. Donald Trump and Florida’s Republican
  governor, Ron DeSantis, celebrated its harsh environment as they toured the
  facility together when it opened last month. Kathleen Williams, a federal
  judge in Miami, last week ordered Alligator Alcatraz to close within 60 days
  for breaching environmental laws, and on Wednesday refused a motion by
  attorneys for the state of Florida and the Trump administration to stay her
  order. It was not clear when the latest incident is alleged to have taken
  place, and the Guardian was unable to independently confirm details. The
  Florida division of emergency management (FDEM), which operates the jail on
  behalf of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), denied it had
  occurred. “These reports are manufactured. There is no uprising happening at
  Alligator Alcatraz. Detainees are given clean, safe living conditions and
  guards are properly trained on all state and federal protocols,” Stephanie
  Hartman, the department’s director of communications, said in an email.
  Protesters who have maintained an almost constant presence at the jail’s gates
  since its 2 July opening said they were unaware of any incident amounting to
  an uprising, but have chronicled other reports of abuse taking place there.
  “People held inside the facility were on hunger strike for more than 14 days,
  despite the DeSantis administration denying it. What they apparently did was
  ship people who were hunger striking out to other facilities, Krome [in
  Miami], to Texas etc, to break it up,” said Noelle Damico, director of social
  justice at the Workers Circle. “[An uprising] would not surprise me given the
  abuses that people have experienced.” DeSantis told reporters on Wednesday
  that authorities have “increased the pace of the removals from there”, after
  Kevin Guthrie, executive director of FDEM, revealed in a memo, reported by the
  Associated Press, that “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals
  within a few days”. The governor announced plans earlier this month for a new
  immigration jail in north Florida, to be called “the deportation depot”, while
  other states have joined the push to build detention camps with names mocking
  immigrants, including the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana, and the “Cornhusker
  Clink” in Nebraska.
