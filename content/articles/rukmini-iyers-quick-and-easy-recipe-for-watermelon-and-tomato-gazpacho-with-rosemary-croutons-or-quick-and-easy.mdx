  I can’t make gazpacho without thinking of Pedro Almodóvar’s Women on the Verge
  of a Nervous Breakdown. If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you
  do, and not just for the iconic spiked gazpacho scene. This version is also
  spiked, but more tamely with watermelon, which lends a wonderful sweetness.
  You can go as simple or as extra as you like with the toppings: I, of course,
  like to go extra with cherry tomatoes of varying colours, ice cubes, micro
  basil, finely cubed cucumber and a swirl of my best extra-virgin olive oil to
  finish. Watermelon and tomato gazpacho with rosemary croutons Green pepper
  haters, you really must include a quarter of one here – it adds the necessary
  slight bitterness to offset the sweet tomatoes and watermelon. Prep 20 min
  Cook 20 min Chill 1 hr+ Serves 4-6 For the gazpacho 350g cherry vine tomatoes
  650g roughly cut fresh watermelon, rind and seeds removed 150g cucumber ½
  small red onion 2 small garlic cloves ¼ green pepper 5 slices good-quality
  white bread, challah ideally 60ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for
  serving 1 tsp sea salt flakes For the croutons 5 slices good-quality white
  bread, again, challah ideally, cut into 1½cm cubes 1½ tbsp olive oil ½ tsp sea
  salt flakes Tips of 6 rosemary sprigs To serve (all optional) Halved cherry
  tomatoes – a mix of yellow and orange looks nice Diced strawberries Finely
  chopped cucumber Ice cubes Sprigs of roasted rosemary Heat the oven to 180C
  (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. For the croutons, tip the cubed bread into a baking
  tray with the oil, sea salt and rosemary, mix well to coat, then roast for 20
  minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Meanwhile, tip all the gazpacho
  ingredients into a food processor and blitz smooth. (I hate to add an extra
  step, but if you transfer this in batches to a high-speed blender and blitz
  again, you will get more soup and less pulp after the sieving process.) Strain
  the soup in batches through a coarse sieve into a clean bowl – use a wooden
  spoon and really push all the liquid through, leaving the bits of pepper skin
  and tomato seeds in the sieve. Once all the gazpacho has been sieved, chill
  the lot in the fridge for at least an hour. Serve in shallow bowls topped with
  your choice of halved cherry tomatoes, diced strawberries, finely chopped
  cucumber and ice, along with the croutons and rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with a
  little extra-virgin olive oil and serve immediately.
