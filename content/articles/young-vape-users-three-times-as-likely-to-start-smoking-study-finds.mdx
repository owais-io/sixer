  Young people who vape are three times as likely to start smoking, develop
  asthma and have poor mental health as those who do not, according to a study
  that lays bare the health impacts of e-cigarettes. Vaping among young people
  is consistently linked to later smoking, according to the largest umbrella
  review of all the evidence on youth vaping, which warns that e-cigarettes
  could act as a gateway. The researchers found associations with other harmful
  consequences including asthma, cough, injuries and mental ill health, as well
  as possible risks of respiratory disease, headaches, poor oral health and
  substance use. Su Golder, an associate professor in health science at the
  University of York and an author of the research, said: “The consistency in
  the evidence is striking. Across multiple studies, young people who use
  e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support
  stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated
  with vaping.” The researchers concluded that although it was not yet possible
  to definitively say vaping leads children to smoke, precautionary policies to
  restrict sales and marketing of vapes to young people were needed. Dr Ronny
  Cheung, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, said the study “adds to the
  mounting evidence that youth vaping is a serious threat to health and
  wellbeing, with strong links to smoking and other harmful behaviours”. Cheung
  urged the government not to further delay implementing the tobacco and vapes
  bill, which will limit the flavours, packaging and marketing of vapes. The
  World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described the rise in children
  vaping around the world as alarming. Figures compiled by Action on Smoking and
  Health this year showed that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had
  tried vaping, amounting to an estimated 1.1 million children, triple the
  levels in 2020. For the new study, which was published in the journal Tobacco
  Control, researchers examined 56 reviews, most of which suggested that young
  people who vape are about three times as likely to start smoking as those who
  do not vape. Asthma was the most common respiratory health condition, with
  consistent associations of between 20% and 36% increased risk of being
  diagnosed with the condition, and a 44% risk of worsening symptoms. The
  researchers acknowledged that the umbrella reviews were of variable quality
  and that it was difficult to prove a causal relationship since the evidence
  was mostly observational. They urged further research to better understand
  whether vapes are genuinely acting as a gateway to smoking. Last month,
  researchers at the University of Michigan established that a third of UK
  teenagers who vape will go on to start smoking tobacco, meaning they are as
  likely to smoke as their peers in the 1970s were. Hazel Cheeseman, the chief
  executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said: “The rise in teen vaping in
  recent years is very concerning and needs urgent action from government. Vapes
  are effective quit aids for adults who smoke and while they are less harmful
  than smoking, they are not risk free and should not be used by children.” Dr
  Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said the
  research showed “that vaping users are more likely to engage in certain
  behaviours, but whether vaping is truly a cause of these behaviours is beyond
  the scope of the data”. He added: “The associations demonstrated are both
  extensive in scope and strong in magnitude – it is clear that vaping users are
  at higher risk of many diseases than non-users. A causal explanation to the
  findings is both plausible and consistent with the evidence provided but such
  a finding can only be made conclusively by a randomised trial. Ann McNeill, a
  professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, noted that many of
  the studies on which the researchers drew for the study were “rated critically
  low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making
  any conclusions”. She said there could be other reasons for the consistency of
  the relationship between vaping and cigarette smoking – for example, a young
  person having a sensation-seeking or impulsive personality. Other research
  looking at population-level trends in vaping and smoking had found that as
  youth vaping increased in a population, smoking reduced, she said. John Dunne,
  UK Vaping Industry Association director general, said: “We have seen a lot of
  research from the scientific community about vaping which does not stand up to
  scrutiny and this latest study seems to fit the bill. “We need to stop
  demonising vaping because until the relative risks of cigarettes and vaping
  are understood by smokers then 220 people will needlessly die in the UK of
  smoking-related illnesses every day.” A Department of Health and Social Care
  spokesperson said: “Our health advice is clear, while vapes are less harmful
  than smoking and can be an effective quit aid for smokers, children and
  non-smokers should never vape. “The worrying rise in youth vaping requires
  attention – that’s why we commissioned this research, the largest
  comprehensive review of the health impacts of youth vaping to date. “We are
  taking decisive action through the landmark tobacco and vapes bill and
  single-use vape ban, which will put an end to the cycle of addiction and stop
  the next generation getting hooked on nicotine.”
