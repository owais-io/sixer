  Another dispute has been added to the sprawling legal saga surrounding Rebel
  Wilson’s directorial debut, The Deb, with the film’s lead actor issuing a
  notice to Wilson threatening legal action against her in Australia. Lawyers
  representing Charlotte MacInnes issued the concerns notice to Rebel Wilson,
  indicating their intentions to sue for defamation in Western Australia. The
  claims of defamation against MacInnes, sent to Wilson on Thursday, centre
  around several Instagram posts Wilson made about MacInnes’s interactions with
  one of the film’s producers. According to the concerns notice, seen by
  Guardian Australia, Wilson alleged in an July 2024 Instagram video that there
  had been “inappropriate behaviour towards the lead actress of the film”.
  Wilson went on to publish several Instagram stories alleging that MacInnes had
  complained to her that she had been sexually harassed during filming. An
  Instagram story allegedly published by Wilson said: “When an actress on her
  first feature film is asked by a producer to stay in the same apartment as
  them, and then makes a complaint to me as the director saying said producer
  ‘asked her to have a bath and shower with her and it made her feel
  uncomfortable’ – what am I supposed to do? Of course I reported it. There is
  no world where this is acceptable.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Wilson
  allegedly went on to say in the Instagram story that MacInnes had “now changed
  her story”, saying this was linked to the fact that MacInnes “has been
  employed now by this ‘producer’ in the lead role of a production … and given a
  record label”. In the concerns notice, MacInnes denies making the claims
  alleged by Wilson, and says the imputations they contain are “false and
  seriously defamatory” and that Wilson knew them to be false because MacInnes
  gave a statement to the Daily Mail in September 2024 saying there “was no
  truth to them”. Two other disputes are playing out in court – in the US and in
  New South Wales – relating to the film, which premiered at the Toronto film
  festival in September but has not been released. Wilson is being sued for
  defamation by three of the film’s producers, after the Australian actor made
  claims to her 11 million Instagram followers that the producers of The Deb had
  engaged in theft, bullying and sexual misconduct. In July 2024, the producers
  – Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron and Vince Holden – filed a defamation suit
  against Wilson in the US, alleging in court documents filed to the Los Angeles
  superior court that Wilson fabricated “false and malicious lies” on Instagram
  in retribution for the producers’ refusal to grant her writing and music
  credits. In October, Wilson launched a countersuit, repeating many of the
  allegations she had initially made on social media. The case remains before
  the court. A separate complaint was lodged two weeks ago when one of the
  production companies behind The Deb filed a lawsuit against Wilson in the NSW
  supreme court, accusing the Pitch Perfect actor of deliberately sabotaging the
  film’s release, alleging threats and defamatory claims had caused the
  production company financial and reputational damage. Wilson said on Instagram
  the proceedings “made no sense” and she “wanted nothing more than to have the
  film released and have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to make this
  happen”. In MacInnes’s concerns notice, her lawyers write that by “publicly
  disclosing our client’s name as an alleged victim of sexual harassment,
  without her consent, and then accusing her of lying about it as justification
  for identifying her”, Wilson engaged in conduct that was “improper,
  unjustified and lacking in bona fides”. The concerns notice also alleges harm
  to MacInnes’s reputation from posts from The Deb’s Instagram account – which
  MacInnes’s lawyers say Wilson “posted or caused to be posted” – that showed
  MacInnes performing on Len Blavatnik’s luxury yacht in Cannes. According to
  the notice, the posts said MacInnes was “in a culturally inappropriate Indian
  outfit … ironically singing a song from a movie that will never get released
  because of her lies and support for the people blocking the film’s release. So
  glad you got your record deal Charlotte at the expense of the 300 people who
  worked on The Deb and really wanna see it released.” MacInnes’s lawyers allege
  that Wilson’s “reputation as a leading Australian star in the international
  film industry means that [her] statements carry particular weight within the
  film industry” and that Wilson’s large Instagram following meant claims she
  made on the platform would have a wide reach. MacInnes is seeking damages and
  costs, as well as a permanent injunction on Wilson publishing similar claims
  about her. Wilson and her representatives were approached for comment.
