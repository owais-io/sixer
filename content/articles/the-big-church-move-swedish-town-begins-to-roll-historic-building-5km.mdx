  After eight years of planning, a cost of more than 500m kronor (£39m) and an
  early morning blessing, a church in northern Sweden began a slow-motion 5km
  journey on Tuesday to make way for the expansion of Europe’s biggest
  underground mine. The 672-tonne Kiruna Kyrka, a Swedish Lutheran church
  inaugurated in 1912, is to be slowly rolled to its new home over two days, at
  a pace of half-a-kilometre an hour. In a huge multi-decade operation, the
  whole of the Arctic town is being moved as an iron ore mine operated by the
  state-owned mining company LKAB weakens the ground, threatening to swallow the
  town. More than 10,000 people, including the Swedish king, Carl XVI Gustaf,
  are expected to line the streets – which have been widened especially to
  accommodate the church – to see the move of the red wooden building. The
  operation was tested successfully on a 30-metre stretch over the weekend. In
  the latest version of “slow TV”, dozens of cameras have been set up along the
  route to enable people across Sweden and the world to watch what is being
  billed by the broadcaster SVT as “Den stora kyrkflytten” (the big church
  move). The church, designed by Gustaf Wickman, is one of Sweden’s most-loved
  older buildings. It is known for its architecture that resembles a lávvu (a
  Sámi hut). On Wednesday, a church service and coffee event will be held in an
  attempt to break a world record for church coffee. There will also be musical
  entertainment, including a concert with the singer Carola. The church is
  expected to reopen at its new location at the end of next year, but the city’s
  entire relocation is not expected to be completed until 2035. The church is
  one of 23 cultural buildings being relocated in what LKAB has described as “a
  unique event in world history”. The mine’s operator gave residents the option
  to either financially compensate those affected by the town’s relocation or
  rebuild homes or buildings. The expansion has attracted criticism, including
  from the Sámi community, who fear that fragmentation of the land will make
  reindeer herding more difficult and threaten the town’s Indigenous culture and
  way of life. Karin K Niia, a reindeer owner and board member of Gabna Sameby,
  a Sámi village that has its year-round lands in Kiruna municipality, said the
  moving of the church was a “big show” to distract from the destruction of the
  town and the culture of its Indigenous people. The church was just “one small
  part of Kiruna” that had been chosen to be preserved, she said, accusing the
  company of “land-grabbing” the grazing territory needed to support Sámi
  culture. “It feels rather difficult to see the move of the church when I’m
  well aware of the consequences that mining activities have on everything
  around it: biodiversity, the air, pollution of water, reindeer and wildlife in
  general,” she said. “They have planned it all in order to get people’s
  attention, media attention on this state-owned company and their action to
  preserve the church as a symbol for the cultural heritage of Kiruna.” Stefan
  Hämäläinen, senior vice president of urban development at LKAB, said: “The
  move of Kiruna church is necessary for it to continue to exist at all. LKAB
  has moved a vast amount of buildings in the ongoing urban transformation that
  began planning over 20 years ago. We are obliged to compensate for what is
  affected by the mine. In the same way, we seek constructive solutions when
  mining operations affect reindeer herding, as it is an important part of Sami
  society and culture.” It has previously declined to specify the cost of the
  move, but on Tuesday the chief executive, Jan Moström, said it had cost more
  than half a billion kronor. He insisted it was worth the money. “If the mine
  is to remain, we have to move Kiruna city centre. Kiruna city centre without
  the church, I can’t see it – so there are no alternatives,” he said during
  SVT’s live broadcast. The altarpiece of the church, a pastel landscape by the
  late Prince Eugen of Sweden, and the more than 2,000-pipe organ have been
  carefully wrapped for the journey, and the ground around the church’s former
  location dug out so that beams could be placed underneath. “The church is
  sitting on a beam system, then two rows of trailers were brought in,” the LKAB
  project manager, Stefan Holmblad Johansson, said. These were slid underneath
  the beams. The bell tower, which is a separate structure, will be moved next
  week.
