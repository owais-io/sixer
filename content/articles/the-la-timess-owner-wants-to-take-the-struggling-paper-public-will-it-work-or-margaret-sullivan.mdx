  When the legendary journalist David Halberstam wrote his landmark 1979 book
  about American journalism, The Powers That Be, he focused on four media
  organizations: the Washington Post, Time magazine, CBS and the Los Angeles
  Times. His choice of the LA newspaper made perfect sense. Influential and
  successful, it was owned by a prominent California family, the Chandlers. The
  paper had high standards, a raft of Pulitzer prizes, and a hard-charging
  Washington DC bureau that competed successfully with its east coast rivals.
  For reporters and editors, the LA Times was a prestigious career destination;
  if you got there, you probably stayed. Nearly 50 years later, the Los Angeles
  Times is much smaller in staff size and circulation size and is losing tens of
  millions of dollars a year. The beleaguered staff was rocked – again – in
  recent weeks with the news that the owner, the billionaire Patrick
  Soon-Shiong, wants to take the newspaper public in the next year. This would,
  he said, “democratize” it. He offered few details, though, as he made the
  announcement on a late-night talkshow during an interview with host Jon
  Stewart, who was roundly criticized for his softball approach. Certainly, the
  paper has been through hell over the decades. It endured many years of owners
  far more focused on profits than on the best interests of the reading public.
  Roughly a decade ago – long after the Chandlers had sold the paper – the Times
  was part of the laughably named and poorly run “Tronc” chain that was busy
  diminishing the Chicago Tribune and other journalistic institutions. The staff
  was shrinking, the hope for profits disappearing and the newsroom’s morale
  low. Then, salvation seemed to arrive. Soon-Shiong, a former surgeon who made
  his fortune in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, bought the paper in 2018,
  coming in hot with promises of restoring the paper’s greatness and public
  mission. Champagne corks popped as the new owner’s view of newspapers as a
  public trust seemed to offer relief from all the drama of recent years. But –
  ever so sadly – those promises have turned out to be mostly hollow, though the
  paper remains the largest news organization in the American west and has a
  respected editor in Terry Tang, formerly of the New York Times. Though it has
  many talented journalists who still churn out important investigations, break
  news and win major awards, it is drowning in red ink and laid off 20% of its
  staff last year. Paid subscriptions are fewer than 300,000, compared with 11m
  at the New York Times and (as of 2023) more than 2m at the Washington Post.
  The billionaire doctor has become closer to Donald Trump and may have allowed
  that relationship to affect the paper’s editorial integrity. Last year, he
  blocked a planned presidential endorsement of then vice-president Kamala
  Harris, causing a cascade of subscribers to cancel and the top opinion editor
  to resign. (Some reports suggested the decision was related to Gaza.) Many a
  journalist, especially on the opinion side, has walked out the door, and a
  celebrated top editor, Kevin Merida, departed last year after disagreements
  with the Soon-Shiong family. Can Soon-Shiong’s latest notion of taking the
  paper public improve this sorry situation? The plan seems far from ideal.
  After all, the large regional newspapers that have thrived in the US are those
  with local ownership committed to the best journalistic practices – including
  editorial independence. The best owners have protected that while working
  toward financial success in this challenging new digital environment.
  Consider: the Philadelphia Inquirer is owned by a local non-profit. The Boston
  Globe is owned by Boston-based John W Henry, whose portfolio includes the
  Boston Red Sox. And the Minnesota Star Tribune is owned by Glen Taylor, a
  Minnesota-based businessperson and former state senator. The worst owners, by
  contrast, are predatory chains such as Alden Global Capital, a Manhattan-based
  hedge fund intent on wringing the last profits from waning newspapers. They
  don’t seem to care about the public mission or about building a sustainable
  future for their papers. Granted, we’re a long way since “the powers that be”
  and from the rich heyday of newspapers when 30% profit margins were nothing to
  marvel at, and when regional papers like the Baltimore Sun and the Chicago
  Tribune boasted foreign bureaus and newsrooms of 400 or more. The industry is
  in sharp decline. No local newspaper has had an easy time since the business
  model changed so radically 20 years ago with the precipitous loss of print
  advertising. But those with reasonably enlightened local ownership have fared
  the best. The LA Times, under Patrick Soon-Shiong, could have been in that
  enviable category – but it didn’t go that way. The chances of restoring the
  gleam to this journalistic jewel can only be described as uncertain. And, for
  many reasons, that’s a shame. Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist
