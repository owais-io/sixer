  Weight loss drugs can reduce by half the risk of heart patients being
  hospitalised or dying early, according to the largest study of its kind. The
  class of drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, have been found to offer “dramatic
  benefits” to heart patients, significantly cutting their risk of falling
  seriously ill or dying prematurely from any cause. The discovery, revealed at
  the world’s largest heart conference in Madrid, mean they could be given to
  millions of heart patients to help them stay out of hospital and live longer.
  Weight loss drugs mimic the glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1 hormone, which makes
  people feel full, and were initially developed to treat diabetes. In recent
  years evidence has emerged suggesting they could prove to be lifesaving across
  a range of conditions beyond obesity. Now the results of major new research,
  presented at the European Society of Cardiology annual conference, show weight
  loss drugs could reduce the risk of people with heart conditions being
  hospitalised or dying early by as much as 58%. In the study, US researchers
  from Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit network of doctors and hospitals
  headquartered in Boston, analysed real-world data from more than 90,000 heart
  failure patients who were obese and had type 2 diabetes. All had heart failure
  with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the most common form of the
  condition. The results showed those taking semaglutide were 42% less likely to
  end up in hospital or die prematurely, compared with a proxy for placebo. In
  the same study, tirzepatide cut the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure
  or death from any cause by 58%. Globally, more than 60 million people have
  heart failure. Previous studies have suggested that weight-loss drugs may
  improve heart failure symptoms, but their effect on important outcomes such as
  hospitalisation and death has never been evaluated in large populations until
  now. The study results presented in Madrid were simultaneously published in
  JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. “Despite the widespread
  morbidity and mortality burden of HFpEF, current treatment options are
  limited,” said the study author Dr Nils Krüger, of Brigham and Women’s
  hospital and a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.
  “Both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well-known for their effects on weight
  loss and blood sugar control, but our study suggests they may also offer
  substantial benefits to patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes by reducing
  adverse heart failure outcomes. “Our findings show that in the future, GLP-1
  targeting medications could provide a much-needed treatment option for
  patients with heart failure.” The findings add to the evidence that weight
  loss drugs may help tackle or prevent heart conditions. In May, a trial found
  that people taking semaglutide had a 20% lower risk of heart attack, stroke or
  death due to cardiovascular disease. The University College London study also
  found semaglutide brought about cardiovascular benefits, regardless of
  someone’s starting weight or the amount of weight that they had lost. Dr
  Carlos Aguiar, the vice-president of the European Society of Cardiology and a
  world-renowned expert in heart failure, who was not involved with the study,
  welcomed the findings. “What this shows is that there is a benefit in using
  one of these two agents, semaglutide or tirzepatide, to reduce the risk of
  hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality. “We thought that we
  actually might not really find a treatment that would work well for a
  significant proportion of these patients, and what’s been a good surprise is
  that these drugs that are working through weight loss, but possibly through
  other effects that go beyond weight loss, are potentially reducing the rates
  of hospitalisation and mortality in patients with heart failure.” Aguiar, a
  cardiology consultant at Hospital Santa Cruz in Carnaxide, Portugal, said more
  evidence would be required before doctors could recommend rolling out weight
  loss drugs to heart patients specifically to cut their risk of adverse health
  outcomes, but the study results were “good news”. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a
  consultant cardiologist and clinical director of the British Heart Foundation,
  said: “These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting a role for
  weight loss drugs for patients living with both heart failure and obesity, to
  reduce hospital admissions and death. “It’s crucial that eligible heart
  failure patients have the opportunity to be considered for these therapies,
  alongside other evidence-based heart failure medicines.”
