  A black coat is like a mortar and pestle: you only need one good one to see
  you through the years. A sleek black coat can be worn almost anywhere too,
  from a fancy night out to over tracky dacks for a pop down to the shops. But
  before you know it, the versatility of the aforementioned coat can unwittingly
  slide into monotony over winter. It’s my third winter with my trusty black
  coat – a cashmere and merino wool blend oversized number from The Curated.
  It’s seen the insides of many offices, pubs and train carriages, and it visits
  the dry cleaner once a year. Over a week, I challenged myself to style it five
  different ways. I naturally try to mix up my outfits as much as I can (because
  wearing the same black puffer jacket every day isn’t good for my mental
  health). I layer with thermals so I can still wear summer pieces, and style up
  outfits with accessories. A bulky belt, bright scarf or playful bag can help
  refresh a well-worn formula. Most of my accessories are secondhand. Some of
  the pieces I’m wearing here have been bought from a street vendor in Newtown’s
  Pride Square, a London car boot sale and various op-shops around Melbourne.
  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips
  for the weekend, every Saturday morning Office: day one Layers are your best
  friend in winter. I’m wearing a shrunken (oops!) wool sweater from McIntyre as
  my base – it was once roomy, but after an accidental hot wash it has become a
  snug, but still wearable undershirt. On top I’ve added an op-shopped red
  cardigan and scarf, all bundled under my coat. Layers don’t have to be
  particularly bulky to keep you warm. A little colour coordination doesn’t hurt
  anybody, either; there’s a recurring thin red stripe down these hand-me-down
  pants from my partner’s mum. Hot tip: wearing knee-high boots under flared
  pants adds extra warmth. Office: day two There comes a time in the middle of
  winter when I become sick to bits of rotating through the same five pants. I’m
  currently there. I don’t believe in separate summer and winter wardrobes,
  especially with how tumultuous our climate is. My silky skirt and woven
  handbag don’t scream sub-10-degree temperatures, but that’s exactly why I
  gravitated towards them. I find that pairing cold-weather essentials (such as
  this coat and these leather boots) with brighter and lighter pieces is a
  simple way to shake me out of my winter fashion slump. Changing the hemline
  from pants to a calf-grazing skirt alters the way the coat sits. When both the
  skirt and coat fall at a similar height, it makes the coat look full-length.
  Weekend: day one Since I saw LA cool girls declare that black coats pair well
  with activewear, I’ve wanted to pair my black coat with activewear. My first
  foray in that direction is draping a HoMie hoodie over my shoulders like a
  shawl. Immediately, I felt as if I could step into an Erewhon undetected. The
  contrast between a dapper coat and a casual hoodie adds a playful,
  celebrity-running-errands-paparazzi-shot energy to a get-up. And as my mother
  says, it’s always good to bring an extra layer. Weekend: day two To make a
  black coat feel less corporate and more casual, I like to create oversized
  silhouettes. Baggy pants, a generous scarf (this one’s from New Zealand label
  Wynn Hamlyn) and a trucker hat tone down the coat’s formality. Playing around
  with how you button a shirt can switch up its vibe, too. One button says “I’m
  off-duty”; all buttons done up say “I mean business”. Night out A black coat’s
  a black coat. No amount of colourful styling will change that. When the outing
  calls for it, I lean into its monochromatic sharpness. For a friend’s birthday
  out on the town, I paired a velvet bodysuit with some secondhand Levi’s jeans,
  and topped off the outfit with a chunky belt and striped handbag. When
  colour’s limited, mix up your textures instead.
