  Republicans

  The Missouri governor, Mike Kehoe, has moved to help the Republican party gain
  an additional seat in Congress, calling a special legislative session to
  redraw congressional districts in his state. Kehoe’s announcement on Friday
  followed a pressure campaign from Donald Trump, who has urged Republican
  states to reshape district boundaries to more heavily favor Republicans,
  boosting the party’s chances of maintaining control of the House of
  Representatives in 2026. The announcement came hours after Texas governor Greg
  Abbott ratified a new congressional voting map that is designed to help
  Republicans gain five more congressional seats in next year’s elections. Trump
  has also pushed Indiana lawmakers to redraw that state’s maps, and has pushed
  lawmakers in Florida and Ohio to help net three or more seats for the
  Republican party. The president celebrated Kehoe’s announcement on social
  media, and urged Missouri lawmakers to pass “a new, much fairer, and much
  improved, congressional map, that will give the incredible people of Missouri
  the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional Maga Republican in the 2026
  midterm elections”. In response, Democratic-led states sought to fight back by
  redrawing their district maps as well, but the party controls fewer state
  legislatures. California’s governor Gavin Newsom has signed two redistricting
  bills to counter Texas’s move, which will have to be approved by voters on 4
  November. Following the approval of Texas’s new congressional maps, the
  Democratic Governors Association released the following statement:
  “Republicans can’t defend their toxic and unpopular agenda of gutting
  healthcare for millions of Americans, so they’re trying to rig our elections
  before a single vote has even been cast. “Democratic governors are on the
  frontlines of this fight – and they will use every tool available to stand up
  for their states and ensure fair representation.” It is highly unusual for
  states to redistrict in the middle of a decade; they normally adjust their
  districting following the decennial census, to reflect population changes.
  Kehoe also said the special legislative session would focus on initiative
  petition reform, which would render citizen-led initiative petitions – such as
  those overturning Missouri’s abortion ban and enacting a minimum wage increase
  and paid sick days – harder to enact. Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democratic
  representative from Missouri whose district could be carved up when maps are
  redrawn, said that in remaking the state’s congressional maps, “lawmakers
  would be working to drown out Missouri voices in favor of a single man a
  thousand miles away”. “But let us be clear: should this effort move forward,
  we will not concede,” he added. “I will not surrender the voices of the people
  who entrusted me to fight for them.”
