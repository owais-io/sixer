  A Texas judge has expanded a restraining order against former congressman Beto
  O’Rourke and his political organization over its fundraising for Democratic
  state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a legislative session on
  congressional redistricting. Tarrant county judge Megan Fahey, a member of the
  conservative Federalist Society and past president of the Fort Worth
  Republican Women’s Club, said in a four-page order published on Saturday that
  O’Rourke and his political group, Powered by People, are barred from sending
  money out of Texas. Fahey found that “harm is imminent to the State, and if
  the Court does not issue this order, the State will be irreparably injured”
  because “defendants’ fundraising conduct constitutes false, misleading, or
  deceptive acts under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act”. Fahey said that
  financial institutions and political fundraising platforms, including ActBlue,
  the main online platform for Democrats, are “immediately restrained from
  removing any property or funds that belong to, or are being held for”,
  O’Rourke or Powered by People “from the State of Texas”. The order came in
  response to a complaint from Ken Paxton, the far-right Republican attorney
  general who is seeking to unseat Republican senator John Cornyn, and also
  attempting to revoke the charter of O’Rourke’s group. On Saturday, O’Rourke
  said his group had donated more than $1m to Texas Democrats since the start of
  the redistricting session prompted their out-of-state walkout. He said the
  group received “more than 55,000 donations” and the money benefited the Texas
  legislative Black caucus, the Texas house Democratic caucus, and the Mexican
  American legislative caucus. Many Texas Democrats have been in Chicago under
  the protective wing of Governor JB Pritzker since early August, each accruing
  fines of $500 a day for failing to attend a session called by the Republican
  Texas governor, Greg Abbott, that would probably add five seats to the
  Republican slate in Congress after next year’s midterm elections. California’s
  governor, Gavin Newsom, has responded in kind, unveiling a plan last week to
  redraw voting lines in his state that could add five safe Democratic seats in
  Congress, if Texas proceeds. Currently, only one in five seats in the House of
  Representatives are considered competitive. The California plan came as Texas
  Democrats are reportedly preparing to make their way home to launch a new
  chapter in the redistricting war after a series of nationwide protests on
  Saturday called “Fight the Trump Takeover National Day of Action”. “We were
  playing chess and they were playing tic-tac-toe,” Texas sate representative
  Jolanda Jones told Austin’s KVUE. “We were able to stop them, so their numbers
  didn’t matter. I think it was a gangster move. It was boss, and I’m proud of
  us.” With members of the Democratic delegation expected to attended a second
  special legislative session in Austin on Monday, meeting the numbers required,
  the Texas redistricting measure is expected to pass. Paxton celebrated the
  judge’s decision, saying that in Texas, “lawless actions have consequences,
  and Beto’s finding that out the hard way.” Paxton said in a statement that
  O’Rourke’s “fraudulent attempt to pad the pockets of the rogue cowards
  abandoning Texas has been stopped” and that “the cabal of Democrats who have
  colluded together to scam Texans and derail our Legislature will face the full
  force of the law, starting with Robert Francis O’Rourke.” O’Rourke, who ran a
  brief campaign for the Democratic party presidential nomination in 2020, filed
  his own lawsuit against Paxton earlier this month that requested a block on an
  investigation into his group and alleged that Paxton was engaged in a “fishing
  expedition, constitutional rights be damned”. O’Rourke said at a protest in
  Austin on Saturday that Democrats were “not going to bend the knee. We’re
  going to stand and fight wherever we have to – from the statehouse to the
  courthouse, from Texas to California.”
