  This week’s parole hearings were the latest twist in the saga of Lyle and Erik
  Menendez, who have been behind bars since their arrest in 1990 for killing
  their parents with shotguns. At their televised trial, which was a 1990s media
  sensation, the brothers said the killings were an act of self-defense after
  years of sexual abuse by their father. A panel of California commissioners
  denied Erik Menendez parole on Thursday. Then on Friday, Lyle Menendez was
  also denied parole. Here are four key takeaways from the hearings this week.
  The Menendez family supports their bid for freedom More than a dozen relatives
  of the two brothers testified in favor of their release at the parole
  hearings, and they reacted with anger to the decision to keep them behind bars
  for at least three more years. “How is my dad a threat to society!!!!!” Erik’s
  stepdaughter Talia Menendez wrote on Instagram. “This has been decades of
  torture to our family. How much longer???” Erik’s wife, Tammi Menendez,
  accused the presiding commissioner of the two-person panel, Robert Barton, of
  bias in a post on X. During the hearing Barton told Erik Menendez, “Contrary
  to your supporters’ beliefs, you have not been a model prisoner,” and cited
  his possession of a contraband phone. Netflix and TikTok have generated new
  sympathy for the brothers Support for the brothers has grown since a
  generation of younger Americans were introduced to the case by the release of
  the Netflix series Monsters, in which Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny played
  their parents, and a Netflix documentary, featuring phone interviews with both
  Lyle and Erik. The new media attention has propelled support for the brothers
  on social networks, including TikTok and Instagram. Even so, the fictional
  drama series, which suggested without evidence that the brothers had an
  incestuous relationship, was denounced by family members as a “grotesque
  shockadrama”. In a statement, the family called Monsters “a phobic, gross,
  anachronistic, serial episode nightmare that is not only riddled with
  mistruths and outright falsehoods but ignores the most recent exculpatory
  revelations”. Erik Menendez also called the series a “dishonest portrayal” and
  criticized what he called “horrible and blatant lies” in the series. The
  brothers have argued for a new trial based on new evidence of sexual abuse
  Lawyers for the brothers filed a petition to a Los Angeles superior court
  judge in 2023 in which they argued that two pieces of evidence discovered
  after their trials support their claims that they were sexually abused by
  their father. If the judge agrees, the brothers could be granted a new trial
  or given reduced sentences. The first piece of evidence is a letter,
  discovered by a reporter, in which Erik described years of sexual abuse by his
  father to a cousin when he was 17. The second piece of evidence is the
  testimony of a former member of the boyband Menudo who said in a 2023
  documentary that the father of the Menendez brothers had sexually assaulted
  him when he was a teenager. The new Los Angeles county DA opposes the release
  of the brothers The movement to release the Menendez brothers suffered a
  setback last November, when George Gascón, the progressive prosecutor who had
  supported a reduction in their sentences – from life in prison without the
  possibility of parole – lost his bid for re-election as Los Angeles county
  district attorney to Nathan Hochman, a Republican who opposed parole. On the
  eve of the election last year, Gascón said in a statement that society’s
  understanding of the impact of sexual abuse had evolved. “Since the original
  prosecution of the Menendez brothers more than nearly three decades ago, our
  office has gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding
  sexual violence. We recognize that it is a widespread issue impacting
  individuals of all gender identities, and we remain steadfast in our
  commitment to support all victims as they navigate the long-lasting effects of
  such trauma,” Gascón wrote. Less than two weeks later, Gascón lost to Hochman
  by nearly 20 points. On Thursday, Hochman said in a statement that the
  decision to deny parole to Erik Menendez “does justice for Jose and Kitty
  Menendez, the victims of the brutal murders carried out by their sons on
  August 20 1989”. “The prior administration’s motion for resentencing failed to
  examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight
  into, and taken complete responsibility for, their crimes,” Hochman added, in
  reference to Gascón’s moves to make parole a possibility.
