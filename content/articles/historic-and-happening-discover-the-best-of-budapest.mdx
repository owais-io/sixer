  Budapest isn’t just Hungary’s capital – it is also its cultural heart, a
  cosmopolitan city packed with architectural marvels, natural beauty and a
  vibrancy that pulses in everything from fashion to food. Wander along the
  Danube that separates the original cities of Buda and Pest and you’ll come to
  one of Europe’s most awe-inspiring creations, the Hungarian Parliament
  Building. Neo-gothic on the outside, neo-Renaissance within, this magnificent
  building sets the stage for Budapest’s captivating collection of baroque and
  art nouveau structures. Just a short two-and-a-half-hour flight from London
  with British Airways, the city is ideal for a weekend away, or a longer break,
  when you can take in the architecture at a more leisurely pace. One of the
  most enjoyable introductions to Budapest is a ride on the city’s distinctive
  yellow trams, specifically line 2. This runs all along the Pest embankment,
  giving you superb views of Buda across the river. Hop off at the 19th-century
  Chain Bridge and take the cute Sikló Funicular up to the Vár (Castle Hill),
  home to some of the city’s most grandiose buildings. Visitors can’t resist
  Fisherman’s Bastion, a 19th-century fortress with ornate towers and turrets –
  not to mention fabulous views of the city. Its equally ornate neighbour, the
  gothic Matthias Church, dazzles with its intricately patterned tiled roof and
  soaring spires. In the midst of all this splendour is the enormous Buda
  Castle, which originally dates from the 13th century and now houses the
  Hungarian National Gallery and its vast collection of Hungarian and
  international art and artefacts over the past millennium. Cross the Danube to
  Pest for more cultural treasures, notably the Museum of Fine Arts, an
  impressive neoclassical building housing more than 100,000 by European masters
  and one of central Europe’s most significant collections of Egyptian
  antiquities. Its setting is just as impressive – right beside Heroes’ Square,
  the largest in Budapest, which was built in 1896 to commemorate the millennium
  of the Hungarian settlement of the Carpathian basin. Here in this handsome
  open space, people gather regularly for cultural events and festivals. It’s
  also the gateway to City Park (Városliget), which has some of Budapest’s most
  enticing attractions spread across 121 hectares (300 acres). One not to be
  missed is the Széchenyi Thermal Baths, whose thermal springs flow into indoor
  and outdoor pools set within a fantastically lavish neo-baroque complex
  painted in vivid yellow. Wallowing in thermal baths is a Hungarian pastime as
  important as stopping for a coffee, a cake and a good gossip in a coffeehouse,
  and Széchenyi is one of the most delightful places to soothe the body and
  spirit. If you’re in Buda, you could take in the Rudas Thermal Bath, which has
  a 16th-century Turkish bath as its centrepiece, as well as a contrasting
  modern rooftop pool overlooking the Danube. Don’t be in too much of a rush to
  leave City Park, however. In the summer, go boating on City Park Lake. When
  Budapest turns into a winter wonderland later in the year, the frozen lake
  becomes a magical setting for ice-skating. Music lovers, meanwhile, will be
  enthralled by the House of Music Hungary, a unique futuristic music museum
  designed by Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto and which has proved a hit since
  it opened in 2022. Under an undulating roof surrounded by trees, it combines a
  music museum with an open-air stage, concert halls and exhibition spaces –
  typical of the creative spirit that flows through the city. As you make your
  way back towards the centre of the city, you’ll walk along Budapest’s grandest
  avenue, Andrássy Avenue, which combines stately villas with major cultural
  institutions including the grand Hungarian State Opera House. Shoppers know
  Andrássy Avenue as the place to browse luxury boutiques such as Louis Vuitton
  and Gucci. Throughout this district runs bustling Váci Street, the main
  pedestrianised artery lined with shops and restaurants. Head to the Central
  Market Hall, whose stalls showcase mouthwatering local produce in a splendid
  neo-gothic hall. Or, alternatively, make the most of the city’s burgeoning
  Michelin-starred restaurant scene. You’ll find a two-star venue in modern
  Hungarian, Stand and six one-star offerings, from Salt to Borkonyha
  Winekitchen. There are also Bib Gourmand options in Goli (the nickname locals
  gave to the historic building), with its Mediterranean and Middle Eastern mix,
  and N28 Wine and Kitchen, where 95% of the wines are Hungarian. In the midst
  of buzzing Pest is another of Budapest’s architectural highlights, the
  imposing 19th-century St Stephen’s Basilica. Not just a place of worship, it
  also hosts weekly concerts and other cultural events within its glittering
  interior. Climb to the top of its dome and you’ll be rewarded with panoramic
  views of Budapest, including the beautiful green and gold Zsolnay-tiled roof
  of the art nouveau Postal Savings Bank. Save one of Budapest’s most relaxing
  sights for last – the green oasis that is Margaret Island in the Danube is
  ideal to jog around or explore by bike. Lose yourself in nature within wooded
  trails and landscaped parks, before going for a swim in the thermal waters of
  Palatinus Strand Baths. There’s no better way to enjoy the stunning panoramic
  views of the city than to take time out on the island with a picnic. With that
  in mind, don’t forget to pack a bottle of the country’s fine Tokaji white or a
  rich red wine – it’s the perfect way to savour them. Find out more and book
  your Budapest trip at ba.com. When you fly with British Airways, you’ll enjoy
  a generous hand-baggage allowance and best of British service. You’ll also be
  able to book an ATOL-protected holiday package with British Airways Holidays,
  with the option of low deposits and flexible payments
