  Mexican-themed chain Guzman y Gomez plans to open at least 15 restaurants in
  the US despite doubling its losses on its “relentless” bid to expand into the
  competitive American market. Despite its struggles in the US, GYG recorded
  more than $1bn in sales across its network for the first time and more than
  doubled its net profit to $14.5m in the 12 months to July – its first year on
  the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Australian investors were rattled even
  though Guzman y Gomez lifted its overall revenue by 23% to $1.181bn, with
  GYG’s share price plummeting by nearly 20% by close of trade on Friday after
  it published its yearly financial results. The company’s co-chief executive
  officers, Steven Marks and Hilton Brett, told investors their ambition was to
  “become the best and biggest restaurant company in the world”. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Marks and Brett said they were committed to their North
  American expansion and were “relentlessly focused on demonstrating proof of
  concept” in the US. The duo said each American restaurant would need to make
  at least US$3m a year in order to be sustainable and “while it will take time,
  we are seeing momentum”. Guzman y Gomez lost A$13.2m on its US stores in the
  12 months to 30 June, up from a $6.5m loss in the 2023-2024 financial year.
  There have been considerable doubts over whether the Sydney-headquartered
  company can crack the US market, which is notoriously difficult for Australian
  food retailers due to different tastes, supply chains and portion sizes.
  During the year, Guzman y Gomez added two urban strip restaurants to its
  network in Chicago, taking the total number of restaurants in the Illinois
  capital – where the company is beginning its foray into the American market –
  to seven. The company’s strategy focuses on building density in the Chicago
  market by “expanding inwards from the suburbs” in a bid to “to deepen
  penetration and strengthen brand presence”. In February, Marks conceded to
  investors the company’s US sales weren’t “growing as fast as we’d like”.
  Nevertheless, Guzman y Gomez plans to open two new US stores in the 2025-26
  financial year and expects its losses in the American market to increase
  slightly during the 12-month period. Marks and Brett told investors they were
  optimistic given it took them 12 years for their Australian restaurants to
  average $40k per week in sales and another seven years to reach $100k. The
  company fared much better at home over the past year, reporting network sales
  of nearly $1.1bn in Australia, partially driven by an increase in night-time
  and breakfast trading with the increased rollout of 24/7 stores. When it
  debuted on the ASX in June last year, the company won over investors by
  announcing plans to increase the number of its Australian stores from fewer
  than 200 to more than 1,000 – a figure chosen to rival McDonald’s – and build
  its international network. Marks and Brett said Guzman y Gomez was “on track”
  to open 40 new restaurants in Australia a year within four years and remained
  confident they could reach 1,000 stores. The company had 256 restaurants
  around the world as of 30 June after opening 39 new restaurants in the 12
  months prior, including 32 in Australia, four in Singapore, one in Japan and
  the two new US stores.
