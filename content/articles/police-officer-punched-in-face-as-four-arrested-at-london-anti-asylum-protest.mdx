  A police officer was allegedly punched in the face and four people were
  arrested at an anti-immigration protest march in London on Sunday. The
  Metropolitan police said they had been facilitating a peaceful demonstration
  along Manchester Road and Westferry Road on the Isle of Dogs before “a small
  number of masked protesters then became aggressive towards members of the
  public and police”. The group had reportedly moved into Canary Wharf shopping
  centre at about 4.30pm. A section 60 AA order was issued to “prevent people
  concealing their identity with masks”, as well as a section 35 dispersal order
  which directed protesters to leave. Both orders last until midnight, police
  said on Sunday evening. The Met said: “Arrests were made for common assault by
  a protester on a member of the public, possession of class A and B drugs,
  assault on police/public order offences and failure to disperse. “One of our
  officers was punched in the face – luckily they did not suffer significant
  injury.” The protest, involving between 50 and 100 people, began outside the
  Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf on Sunday afternoon. Some
  anti-immigration demonstrators were seen carrying union flags and placards.
  About 100 counter-protesters held banners bearing slogans including “stand up
  to racism” and “stop the far right”. The group also chanted: “Say it loud and
  say it clear, refugees are welcome here.” Commander Adam Slonecki, in charge
  of policing London this weekend, said: “This afternoon we have unfortunately
  seen more disorder, following the five arrests made yesterday in the West
  Drayton area. “Today’s protest saw many community members attend, including
  women and children, and we worked to ensure the safety of those there to
  peacefully represent their views. “Those who arrive at protests masked and
  intent on causing trouble will continue to be dealt with robustly at future
  protests.” He added: “We remain in the area to deter any further disorder and
  provide reassurance to local residents and businesses.” Elsewhere on Sunday,
  three people were arrested after hundreds of protesters gathered again outside
  the Bell hotel in Epping calling for the removal of asylum seekers housed
  there. Essex police said a woman was arrested on suspicion of breaching a
  section 14 order, requiring demonstrators to stay in a prescribed area during
  the protest. A man was also arrested “on suspicion of inciting racial hatred
  after an emblem was reported to have been set alight” on Friday, while another
  was arrested for breaching the section 14 order in place after reportedly
  refusing to leave when the assembly on Sunday had ended. Police added that all
  three remained in custody on Sunday evening. Several protesters were seen
  waving union and St George’s cross flags during Sunday’s protest. “Send them
  home, please protect me,” read a T-shirt worn by one young girl, while a boy
  held up a sign saying “deport foreign criminals”. Police put in place a
  dispersal order “to prevent and deal with any antisocial behaviour”, and a
  section 60 AA order, both of which remained in place on Sunday evening. The
  Bell hotel became a focal point for protests in July after an asylum seeker
  staying there was accused of sexually assaulting two 14-year-old girls. He has
  denied the allegation, telling a court on Wednesday that he did not touch the
  girls. The latest protests come two days after an appeal court overturned a
  temporary injunction that had blocked the use of the hotel to house asylum
  seekers. Stuart Hooper, assistant chief constable with Essex police, said:
  “We’ve consistently said that we will always seek to facilitate lawful protest
  but that does not include a right to commit crime, and we’ll take a firm
  approach to anyone intent on doing that. “And, to reiterate to the public, the
  strength of feeling in Epping is not lost on me – or anyone in Essex police –
  and I would urge anyone who wants to make their voices heard to please do that
  peacefully and within the parameters outlined.”
