  Is terrorism really a vicar with a peaceful placard? As parliamentarians who
  are passionate about democracy and civil liberties, we know that both are
  under threat. A growing number of organisations encourage violence and
  intimidation in pursuit of political aims. MPs are besieged with threats,
  advised not to hold in-person surgeries and are grieving still for two
  colleagues killed in the past 10 years. Anti-migrant protests and threats are
  encouraged by the far right to take place across the country. Yet attempts to
  address all this are increasingly destabilising public confidence in politics,
  emboldening those who fan the flames of hatred by claiming a “two-tier”
  response. Without change, the danger that someone will get hurt – or killed
  again – will only grow. Driven by both homegrown and overseas extremism, and
  social media algorithms, there is a growing trend for direct action to end in
  physical harm or destruction in order to get noticed. Proscription is the
  primary tool open to governments to put a hard stop to this, but with nearly
  100 organisations and hundreds more Britons now labelled “terrorists” in
  recent weeks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain parity between
  the organisations proscribed within the public mind. For any law to be
  effective, it has to be workable and legitimate. For it to defend democracy,
  it must also not be designed – or be seen to be designed – to spare ministers
  the difficulties of dealing with dissent. Proscription puts the person
  peacefully expressing opposition into the same category as the person planting
  a bomb or shooting a bullet. We came down on different sides in last month’s
  vote on whether to proscribe Palestine Action, and neither of us have ever
  supported the group. But we both agree what is happening now neither protects
  protest nor makes protest policeable. We have three shared convictions. First,
  no one – including elected politicians and the police – should face violent
  threats or intimidation for doing the job that we ask of them, even if we
  disagree with how they do it. Second, everyone should be able to protest and
  engage in non-violent disruption without being lumped in with Islamic State,
  al-Qaida or the IRA. Third, legislation to uphold our civil rights and to stop
  intimidation should be cause-blind: protecting those whom we wish to beat at
  the ballot box by enabling all citizens to be heard and parliamentarians to do
  our jobs. How, then, should the government respond? First and foremost with
  common sense. Urgent police guidance should be issued to head off the car
  crash that proscription enforcement is rapidly becoming, by setting out a test
  of proportionality for any interventions. Proscribing the original Palestine
  Action group was said to be about stopping those inciting direct harm and
  violence. Going after people with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty –
  some who may or may not even support Palestine Action but feel strongly about
  Palestinian rights – confuses rather than clarifies the government’s
  intention. People must be able to protest about the horror in Gaza, and the
  focus should be on what is happening in Palestine, not in Parliament Square.
  The government should be much more transparent about how it is upholding our
  constitutional rights. There is no free speech if one half of a political
  debate lives in fear of being targeted for disagreeing. We need mechanisms to
  stop those who use violence, threaten migrants or hound women instead of
  raising their voices to achieve their goals. Lord David Anderson, the former
  independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, argued that proscription should
  always be a time-limited process – and we agree. It should also be targeted at
  real terrorists whose explicit intention is to kill innocent civilians. No
  democratic state should make arbitrary decisions and must actively seek the
  consent of citizens. As it stands, how proscription is achieved – short
  parliamentary debates in both houses and, in the case of Palestine Action,
  bracketing the organisation along with two far-right groups in a single vote –
  fails this test. To have the ability to proscribe a group as “terrorists”,
  ministers and government must do much more to show the public how and why that
  is the case. We must also address the glaring inconsistencies and real gaps in
  law these cases reveal. Legislation on public order focuses on specific
  practices; proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits
  between this to recognise when organisations themselves encourage members
  repeatedly and deliberately to escalate intimidation in pursuit of their aim.
  Extreme groups create a climate of violence, leaving refugees waiting to be
  firebombed, Jewish citizens attacked, black and Muslim citizens living in
  fear, and women increasingly vilified. Getting the balance right means
  abolishing offences such as “recklessly encouraging support” of a proscribed
  group and focusing instead on those who organise this criminality. Setting out
  how and when behaviour threatens our democracy – as distinct from criticising
  state policies – would also better maintain the integrity of the seriousness
  of terrorism charges. Stopping organisations that are not simply accidentally
  violent, but intentionally so, means a new offence is needed, distinct from
  the battery of existing criminal ones. This would recognise how groups that
  encourage violence and intimidation go beyond existing public order offences,
  disentangling non-violent direct action from violence or attacks on property
  and terrorism. The alternative – accepting that harm to individuals is an
  inevitable risk of protest because people feel strongly about something – is
  not tenable. Terrorism is different from terrifying opponents, but both are or
  should be criminal offences. The failure to make that distinction is both
  increasingly infecting the policing of protest and undermining the legitimate
  right to protest. Anyone who thinks this situation is simple – either an
  egregiously authoritarian power-grab from the government or a sincere
  intention to block violent thuggery – isn’t paying attention. The status quo
  has come to mean equating peaceful witness with terrorism, and isn’t
  sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn’t a problem that threatens
  our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide in our democracy.
  Without action, it will be those with the loudest voices and the most lethal
  actors who win. Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for
  Walthamstow. Peter Hain was the Labour MP for Neath from 1991 to 2015 and now
  sits in the House of Lords Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
