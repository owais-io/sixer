  Lando Norris has said he will “chill out and just go for it” in an effort to
  bridge the gap to his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, after the British
  driver was forced to retire from the Dutch Grand Prix and the Australian took
  a 34-point lead in the world championship. Norris was just nine points behind
  Piastri going into the 15th round of the season at Zandvoort but an oil leak
  cost him dear. With seven laps to go when he was in second place and just over
  one second behind Piastri, Norris was left helpless as his car ground to a
  halt by the side of the track. Nine meetings remain this season and Piastri
  has enough of a lead that catching him will take a herculean effort from
  Norris, which the British driver acknowledged. “It’s only made it harder for
  me and put me under more pressure but it’s almost a big enough gap now that I
  can just chill out about it and just go for it,” he said. “The only thing I
  can do is try to win every race. That’s going to be difficult, but I’ll make
  sure I give it everything I can.” Piastri dominated from pole in Zandvoort and
  was unlikely to have been passed by Norris even had he made it to the flag.
  The British driver conceded that clawing back the points in the fight against
  his teammate, who now has seven victories this season, would be an immense
  task. “It’s just close, I have a good teammate, he’s strong,” Norris said.
  “He’s quick in every situation, every scenario. It’s hard to get things back
  on someone who’s just good in pretty much every situation.” Piastri, however,
  was far from taking anything for granted, despite the advantage. Asked if he
  thought he could now play the percentages on the run-in to the title he was
  unequivocal. “No, there’s still a long way to go,” he said. “I need to keep
  pushing and trying to win races still. I wouldn’t say it’s a very comfortable
  margin. As we saw today, it can change with one DNF very, very quickly.”
  McLaren have yet to confirm if the oil leak came from the engine or chassis
  after a very unusual reliability failure in the most recent phase of the
  turbo-hybrid era – poor fortune which Norris had to accept. “It’s not like in
  the olden days when you used to pretty much blow up every other race,” he
  said. “Then I think it was inevitable. We don’t expect it nowadays. It’s just
  frustrating, unlucky, and that’s it.”
