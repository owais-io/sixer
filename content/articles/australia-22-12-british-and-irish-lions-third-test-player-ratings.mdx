  Australia Tom Wright Another confident outing from a quality operator
  throughout the series. Joined the attack well and his kicks from hand
  regularly created territorial advantage. 7 Max Jorgensen Carried the ball for
  quite a few metres, including plenty on the way to scoring a poacher’s try.
  Aggressive all game. 7 Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii Glimpse of his quality to put
  Pietsch in the corner to open the scoring. Also put in a rattling tackle to
  dislodge the ball from Tadhg Beirne late on, but anonymous for large spells. 6
  Len Ikitau Held up just short on a dart to the line that should have had him
  on the scoreboard. Summed up a display that did not reach the heights of
  previous weeks. 6 Dylan Pietsch Opened the scoring with a dazzling diving
  finish; the zenith of a performance that was emblematic of his team. Popped up
  all over the park making aggressive interventions in attack and defence. 9 Tom
  Lynagh Left proceedings early after taking a knock in the 35th minute. Up to
  that point it was a broadly competent outing in howling conditions. 6 Nic
  White What a way to end a Test career. Led from the front in setting the
  rhythm and pace of the team, kicked beautifully from the base of the ruck and
  took winding up the opposition scrum-half to pantheon levels. 9 James Slipper
  If last week showed what he could do in the loose, the veteran was back on top
  form in the scrum this time out. At his age it is a lot to ask to do both. 6
  Billy Pollard Caused a flutter of worry with a poor throw at his first
  lineout, but redeemed minutes later by winning a turnover penalty. Solid
  enough after that. 6 Taniela Tupou Brought his considerable mass to bear in an
  impressive scrum performance. One 20-metre carry just after the weather break.
  7 Nick Frost Chief architect of a transformed lineout and senior wrecking ball
  to the disintegrating Lions. 8 Will Skelton Much is made of the lock’s
  physical stature, which he employed to great effect. Just as important is his
  evil henchman approach that unsettled the Lions all game. 8 Tom Hooper Led the
  team in carries as he tirelessly took the fight to the opposition in attack.
  Was not found wanting in defence, either. 8 Fraser McReight Made the breakdown
  his arena for much of the game, winning turnovers and being a general menace.
  Also topped the tackle chart for his team. 8 Harry Wilson Always willing to
  work harder than anyone else, even if he is coming off second-best physically,
  which he often was. 6 Replacements Brandon Paenga-Amosa (for Pollard, 72) n/a;
  Angus Bell (for James Slipper, 57) 6; Zane Nonggor (for Tupou, 60) 6; Jeremy
  Williams (for Skelton, 63) 7; Langi Gleeson (for Hooper, 77) n/a; Tate
  McDermott (for White, 58) 8; Ben Donaldson (for Lynagh, 33) 7; Andrew Kellaway
  (for Jorgensen, 77) n/a. British &amp; Irish Lions Hugo Keenan Bundled over
  his own line early on and had a mix up with a clearing kick outside the 22 in
  second half. Other than that, a competent job in tricky conditions. 6 Tommy
  Freeman A few decent runs before his early exit, but second fiddle to the
  irrepressible Pietsch. 6 Huw Jones Not the ideal context for a classy 13 to
  operate in given the downpour and disjoined nature of his team. Pushed to the
  wing, where he shanked an attempted chip and chase into touch. 5 Bundee Aki
  This was a game when a big carrier should have set the tone, but he was
  penalised in key moments, dropped too many balls and was easily marshalled by
  the Wallabies. 4 Blair Kinghorn Offered more security out wide under the high
  ball than the departed Lowe, but did throw a loose pass that set up the second
  Australia score. 6 Finn Russell Some inventive kicks to keep his side
  interested. A tricky day for an outside-half whose forwards were second-best,
  but has to take responsibility for some of the imprecision in the backs. 6
  Jamison Gibson-Park His quiet authority is usually such a boon to any team,
  but that was decisively shouted down by the performance of White. 5 Andrew
  Porter Energetic with carries in the loose, but splintered under the pressure
  of Tupou and Skelton’s weight in the scrum. 5 Dan Sheehan A poor performance
  by his standards. Throws were stolen or misdirected too often, no try to his
  name and faded under the captaincy pressure when Itoje left the field. 5 Tadhg
  Furlong Lost out to Slipper in the tight and his team did not have enough ball
  for him to show some of his physicality on the hoof. 5 Maro Itoje Limited
  impact due to a head injury, but was right up there as one of the better
  performers before early exit. Plenty of tackles and worked hard. Unable to win
  a lineout, however. 6 James Ryan Was trying manfully to duplicate his impact
  off the bench last week and mostly failing until accidental knee to the head
  removed him from action. 6 Tadhg Beirne In a good match for back-rowers the
  Ireland man again showed his quality. Stole an early lineout, won some jackal
  turnovers and was full of running even late on. 7 Tom Curry Not as hugely
  effective as his previous two outings, but led the tackle line from the front
  on a day when the Lions had to do a lot of defending. 7 Jack Conan Put in an
  honest shift as always. Was caught with the ball on the ground by Hooper at
  one point, which summed up his general lack of ascendancy. 6 Replacements:
  Ronan Kelleher (for Sheehan, 57) 5; Ellis Genge (for Porter, 42) 5; Will
  Stuart (for Furlong, 57) 6; Ollie Chessum (for Itoje, 27) 5; Jac Morgan (for
  Ryan, 42) 6; Ben Earl (for Conan, 63) 5; Alex Mitchell (for Gibson-Park, 71)
  n/a; Owen Farrell (for Freeman, 37) 5
