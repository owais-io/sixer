  Australia made light work of Samoa with a flawless performance in Salford,
  registering their record margin of victory in a Women’s World Cup game to move
  top of Group A after the opening round of fixtures. With the competition
  expanding from 12 teams to 16, it was perhaps expected there would be some
  one-sided results. This was categorically one of those as the Wallaroos began
  their campaign with a dominant victory to tee up what will almost certainly be
  a winner-takes-all clash with USA next Saturday in York to qualify with
  England. They scored 11 tries, including seven in a blistering first-half
  performance to not only surpass their record 62-0 victory over South Africa,
  in the 2010 tournament, but move ahead of England on points difference. Samoa
  showed plenty of spirit, but they were well beaten on their first World Cup
  appearance since 2014. Australia’s coach, Jo Yapp said: “I’m really proud of
  the girls, because they work so hard behind the scenes. We know Samoa are a
  tough side and they never roll over, so full credit to them. The confidence to
  move the ball was great and in that first half we were clinical, more than we
  have been recently. To keep them at nil, because they were throwing a lot at
  us in the second half, was great.” The writing was on the wall from the first
  minute for Samoa, when Harmony Vatau kicked out on the full from inside her
  own 22. From the resulting lineout they illustrated their superiority as
  Katalina Amosa drove over, with Sammy Wood converting. It set the tone for
  what would follow. Five minutes later, some fine handling freed Miller to
  score in the corner before Caitlyn Halse broke from deep to score Australia’s
  third. The Wallaroos secured their bonus point inside 15 minutes as Emily
  Chancellor powered over before Eva Karpani was the latest beneficiary of
  another strong maul to make it 33-0. Miller scored her second after another
  wonderful piece of play allowed the winger a simple finish in the corner, but
  as half-time approached Samoa did begin to show signs of improvement with the
  ball, but errors would continue to be their undoing. Those errors were
  allowing Australia to extend their lead almost every time they advanced into
  Samoan territory. Their seventh try came when Miller completed her hat-trick
  as she combined with fellow winger, Maya Stewart. The biggest roars of that
  first half came whenever Samoa pushed hard for their first points in
  Australian territory, but by the break they had been unable to breach the
  Wallaroos’ line. To Samoa’s immense credit, they were much more resolute after
  half-time. While they had some chances to score their first points and came up
  short, they were proving a much sterner test after the interval. The first
  Australia try of the second half arrived on 53 minutes when centre Cecilia
  Smith brought up their half century. It would take another 15 minutes for them
  to score again with Samoa showing some magnificent spirit before Australia’s
  maul proved too dominant again, this time Adiana Talakai scoring. The record
  try arrived four minutes from time. After Melina Grace Salale was sent off for
  a dangerous tackle, Talakia forced her way over for her second and the
  Wallaroos’ 10th before Halse scored her second in the final minute. Samoa’s
  coach, Ramsey Tomokino, said: “Our players now understand what it’s like to be
  at a Rugby World Cup. It’s not the result we wanted, but full credit to
  Australia. We knew Australia were going to be tough. The message at half-time
  was ‘let’s win the second half’. It was a better second-half effort from our
  players.”
