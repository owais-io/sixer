  You had to see Jeff Buckley to believe him. Jon Pope, a veteran of the
  Australian music industry, was tour manager for the singer on his first visit
  to Australia, in 1995. Three days after Buckley’s first show at the Metro in
  Sydney on 28 August, the road crew were preparing for a much more intimate gig
  at the Lounge in Melbourne for an audience of a few hundred. Pope had an
  unusual request to make, per Buckley’s management. “You know those old cash
  registers that would go ‘ping’ when the tray would pop out? I had to tell them
  to turn them all off,” he remembers, laughing. The bar manager was aghast.
  “You’ll understand why when he starts playing,” Pope tried to reassure him.
  When Buckley and his band took the stage, the effectiveness of the edict
  became apparent. Buckley’s voice, and his band, soared and swooped. It was a
  masterclass in dynamics: in the silences between and sometimes during songs
  (the brief drop-out in So Real, for example), you could hear the proverbial
  pin drop. It is now 30 years since that first tour by Buckley to Australia
  (where his career first began to gain international traction) and 31 years
  since the release of his only finished album, Grace. The anniversary coincides
  with a revival of interest in Buckley, with a documentary, It’s Never Over,
  Jeff Buckley, showing first at Sundance and the Melbourne international film
  festival earlier this month. And in September, singer Katie Noonan is touring
  a 20-date Buckley tribute show, with shows at Melbourne’s Hamer Hall and
  Sydney’s Enmore theatre already sold out. Sign up for our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As an
  18-year-old, Noonan saw Buckley for the first and only time on his second and
  last tour of Australia, in February 1996. “I had never heard a voice used that
  way – never before, never since,” she says. “He was a once-in-a-lifetime.”
  Buckley’s death in 1997 at the age of 30 (an impromptu swim in the Wolf River
  in Memphis ended tragically when he was dragged underwater by a passing
  tugboat and drowned) has left a difficult legacy. A contentious unfinished
  album, Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, was released in 1998, followed by
  a seemingly endless stream of live recordings and assorted barrel-scrapings.
  Those live recordings are almost all variations of the songs Buckley recorded
  for Grace, one of the most acclaimed albums of the last three decades. Buckley
  simply didn’t live long enough to fulfil his enormous talent. Overfamiliarity
  has bred a degree of contempt. So too the many pale imitators, not to mention
  the buskers laying waste to his version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah on
  seemingly every street corner. As a witness to those shows though, I can
  confirm: Buckley was the real deal. A few days after his performance at the
  Lounge, I drove 13 hours from Brisbane to Sydney to see the last gig of the
  tour at the Phoenician Club, recorded by Triple J for Live at the Wireless. (I
  still give thanks to my then-partner, who brazenly purchased our tickets
  before we were officially an item.) He had it all. He could sing like a bird,
  he was a great guitar player, he was a superb bandleader, he had the songs
  (Lover, You Should Have Come Over sounded like an instant standard). He was
  also a gifted interpreter of other artists’ material: no one else could tear
  through the MC5’s Kick Out the Jams, then slip effortlessly into Nina Simone’s
  crushing Lilac Wine. It didn’t hurt, of course, that he was terribly
  good-looking. Warwick Brown, who runs the Melbourne record emporium Greville
  Records, was an early convert. Already a fan of Buckley’s father Tim, he’d
  heard Jeff’s first release, the EP Live at Sin-é, before Grace appeared in
  August 1994. “The day it came in, we stayed back after work to smoke a joint
  and lie on the floor and listen to it,” he remembers. “It just blew our
  minds.” Brown points out that if Buckley isn’t exactly a hip name to drop now,
  he wasn’t at the time, either. Coming at the tail end of grunge, Buckley was
  covering Van Morrison, Édith Piaf, even Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Alongside
  Hallelujah and Lilac Wine, Grace also featured a rendition of Benjamin
  Britten’s Corpus Christi Carol as delicate as gossamer. But it wasn’t an
  instant hit. “It was the sort of record you had to turn people on to, which is
  hard to believe these days,” Brown remembers. The Lounge show was full of
  hardcore music nerds, so perhaps Buckley was preaching to the choir, but once
  the show finished, “everyone was a fanatic”. By the time his Australian tour
  finished at the Phoenician Club, he was a star. Six months later, Buckley was
  back in Australia, playing more shows to much bigger rooms. “We tripled the
  audience,” Pope says. It was unusual for an international artist to return to
  Australia within such a short time frame, but Australia (and increasingly
  France) remained his stronghold. Back in the United States, he was still a
  cult act. Noonan drove from Brisbane down to Seagulls, a sports club on the
  Gold Coast, to see him: “It was a hugely transformative event in my life. I
  just went, whatever this band is doing, I want to do that, whatever that is.”
  But to Brown, Buckley looked exhausted at this point. “I heard someone say
  ‘It’s great to have you back,’ and he said, ‘I haven’t been home since last
  time I was here.’” After Buckley died, he says, “It was so painful that I
  don’t think I could listen to him for a long time without that sadness that
  came with it. I just couldn’t believe it. It was such a tragic, silly way to
  die, and I wish we were talking about his fifth album, not his first one. He
  was a phenomenal artist.” It is the younger music fans who come through
  Brown’s shop who are the acid test of Grace’s longevity. “We’re all jaded old
  men, but then 20-year-olds come in and go, ‘What the fuck is this?!’ That’s a
  sign of good music. Grace is a record that just never stops selling. We would
  sell a copy of that record every single day.” Really, though. You had to be
  there.
