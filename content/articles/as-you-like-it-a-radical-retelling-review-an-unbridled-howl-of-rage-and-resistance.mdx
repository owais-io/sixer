  As You Like It: A Radical Retelling review – an unbridled howl of rage and
  resistance
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  ‘Aren’t you sorry you forced me to learn English?” If that sounds more like
  The Tempest’s Caliban than anything in As You Like It – well, don’t expect
  Cree- and Lakota-heritage writer and performer Cliff Cardinal’s “radical
  retelling” to resemble the original. Instead, it features Cardinal himself,
  performing and deconstructing the kind of “land acknowledgment” with which
  public performances in North America are nowadays introduced. To Cardinal, the
  ritual is a vacuous apology in lieu of reparations or reversal of the original
  offence. But, if we’re in the acknowledgment game – well, there are plenty of
  other issues around Indigenous life, and the lives of those of us in the
  audience, that could use some acknowledging. What follows bears scant
  similarity to Shakespeare, only a little to theatre, and slightly more to
  lecture-meets-standup; Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette leaps to mind. Like Nanette,
  Cardinal’s show majors in making its audience as uncomfortable as possible, as
  he arraigns us with Britain’s history of genocidal violence, the feebleness of
  our presumed allyship with oppressed groups – and, latterly, with the
  discovery of the remains of hundreds of Indigenous children at school sites
  around Canada. He prowls the stage, wired, angry, cracking bleak jokes, as one
  disgruntled festivalgoer after another makes for the exit. That’s
  understandable: this is a confrontational performance. It’s also one created
  in a North American context, that loses something in translation at the
  Edinburgh international festival – not least its audience’s stake in the “land
  acknowledgment” convention. Not all of Cardinal’s transpositions to the UK
  feel well informed. Some of his generalisations, about white prejudice and
  virtue signalling, rankle and feel cynical. His arguments take “jumps in
  logic”, by his own admission, that make them hard to follow. But there are
  hard truths here, too, about the stubbornness of systemic subjugation and the
  racism inherent even in positive representations of Indigenous life. In any
  event, Cardinal seems beyond aesthetic or ideological fine-tuning at this
  point, and his As You Like It is less “insinuating with us in the behalf of a
  good play” (in Rosalind’s words), more howl of pain and anger. It’s an act of
  reverse colonisation, seizing our space and making it his own. It’s not always
  agreeable, but it demands to be heard. • At Church Hill theatre, Edinburgh,
  until 23 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
