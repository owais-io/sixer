  Two teenagers have been detained for the “sadistic” torture and killing of two
  kittens found cut open and hung in a wooded area in London. A 17-year-old boy,
  who said he had dreamed of killing a human, butchered a small black kitten and
  hung it with rope near Ruislip, in the north-west of the capital, in May.
  Judge Rai said the killings were “without a doubt the most awful offences
  against animals I have seen in this court”. The judge said the boy’s actions
  were “extensively planned” and “clearly premeditated”, and told him that he
  had seemingly attacked kittens because “they have emotion and you would have
  power over them”. The judge continued: “You said sorry in your [police]
  interview but reports also show that you struggle to show empathy and realise
  that the kittens would suffer.” The boy, who cannot be named because of his
  age, had spoken of his desire to “get away with murder”, a hearing at London’s
  Highbury Corner magistrates court was told on Monday. Notes on his phone read:
  “I really wanted to murder someone. Every day I was researching how to get way
  with murder. “I have come close. I have killed cats to reduce my urges. I have
  skinned, strangled and stabbed cats.” The teenager, along with a 17-year-old
  girl, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animals
  by mutilating and killing them. The pair also each admitted one count of
  possession of a knife at Ruislip golf course. There was no reaction from the
  boy as he stood in the dock and was handed a 12-month detention and training
  order. The girl, who also cannot be named, was sentenced to nine months in
  custody. Valerie Benjamin, prosecuting, told the court the boy’s “sadistic”
  actions showed a degree of planning in looking for animals, researching how to
  kill them and his “desire to go on to killing humans and how it would be to
  get away with murder and killing a homeless person”. A month after their
  arrest, the pair were reported missing and were found at a bus stop with a bag
  containing clothes, toiletries and tins of tuna, the Metropolitan police said.
  The boy admitted his role in the animal cruelty during his police interview,
  Benjamin said. He had no previous convictions. She added: “He gave a prepared
  statement saying he was sorry for what he had done and took responsibility
  saying he was in a bad state of mind. “He said he suffered depression,
  anxiety, hallucinations and self-harm.”
