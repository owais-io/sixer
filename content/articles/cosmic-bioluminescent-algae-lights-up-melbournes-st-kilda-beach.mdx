  Beachgoers in Melbourne have been treated to the “cosmic and magical” sight of
  bioluminescent algae off St Kilda beach this week. Richard Pensak, a marine
  biologist at local environment group Earthcare St Kilda, spotted the bright
  pink-coloured cloud in the water on Sunday, and immediately knew what it was.
  When he returned to the water after dark, crowds had already gathered to see
  the “really pretty and sparkly” spectacle. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It
  just lights people up,” Pensak said. Bioluminescent algae is a rare but not
  unprecedented sight in Port Phillip bay. The natural phenomenon, known as “sea
  sparkles” or “red tide” is caused by an algae called noctiluca scintillans:
  beautiful to look at but potentially irritating to fish due to high levels of
  ammonia and reduced oxygen levels in the water. Pensak described seeing the
  effect first-hand as a “bucket list” item, while acknowledging its flipside –
  that the algae’s expanded range is associated with rising ocean temperatures.
  Ryan Abramowitz, a local author and illustrator, described the iridescent blue
  of the algae rippling on the water’s surface as “awe-inspiring” and like
  “shimmering galaxies whirling and swirling across the shore”. Visiting the
  beach on Monday evening, he splashed through the cold early spring water to
  see the “stunning rhythmic trails” of light. “I go for night swims all the
  time, but this was definitely the most cosmic and magical,” he said, “an
  exquisite unfolding for the first day of spring”. Abramowitz said he had seen
  bioluminescent algae before in Sydney and Bali, but never before in Melbourne.
  First documented in Sydney Harbour in 1860, the bioluminescent algae has
  become a much more common sight in Australian waters since the 1990s,
  particularly in Sydney and Tasmania. Prof Shauna Murray, an algae expert and
  marine biologist at the University of Technology Sydney, said the species had
  proteins called luciferase that enabled it to glow at night. The phenomenon is
  quite common along Australian coasts, she said, and a natural part of the
  ecosystem, expanding farther south into Tasmania due to warming waters off the
  east Australian current.
