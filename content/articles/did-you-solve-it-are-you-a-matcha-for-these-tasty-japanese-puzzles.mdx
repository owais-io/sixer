  Earlier today I set you three puzzles from Tasty Japanese Morsels in
  Recreational Mathematics. Here they are again with solutions. 1. Squid game
  Two octopuses will face off in a boxing match. Each octopus requires eight
  gloves. (There is no distinction between left and right gloves.) The rules of
  octopus boxing stipulate that an octopus must only wear gloves of the same
  colour. There is a bag containing 16 red gloves and 16 green gloves. Find the
  minimum number of gloves that must be drawn at random from the bag to
  guarantee that the colours of the gloves of the two octopuses are (a) the
  same. (b) different. (c) either the same or different. Solution (a) 31 (b) 24
  (c) 23 (a) If the lone glove left behind is red, both octopuses can wear green
  gloves. If the lone glove left behind is green, both octopuses can wear red
  gloves. (b) Imagine the first 16 choices are all of one colour. You will then
  need 8 of the other. (c) With 23 gloves, at least 7 are one colour (say red)
  and at least 8 are the other (say green). If there there exactly 7 red, then
  both octopuses can wear green. If there are more than 7 red, one can wear red
  and the other green. (Likewise, if at least 7 are green, and at least 8 are
  red, we get the same result.) 2. Sum-o wrestling. The diagram below represents
  a multiplication in which all but two of the digits have been replaced by
  stars. Reconstruct the computation. Solution Replace the stars with letters A
  to J. H must be 1 since F plus the carry of (D+G) must be 10 or larger. In
  fact, since the carry of D+E can at most be 1, it must be the case that H = 1,
  I = 0, and F = 9. We also know thanks to the given 1, that D + G = 11. Also,
  note that E = J Now to the multiplications. We know that 2 × AB = FG =
  ninety-somthing. So A = 4. And since C x AB = DE, we can deduce that C is 1 or
  2. (If it was 3 or larger C x AB would have threedigits.) Suppose C = 1. Then
  AB = DE, which means that D = A = 4. However, we know G must be even, since G
  = 2 x B, so D + G is even, but this contradicts D + G = 11. Hence C = 2 and D
  = F = 9. It follows that J = E = G = 2 and B = 6. 3. Another boxing puzzle A
  restaurant uses 4 × 4 and 5 × 5 Bento boxes each divided into exactly eight
  square sections, as shown in the diagram below. The chef has asked you to
  create Bento boxes with rectangular boxes. Each Bento must still have eight
  square sections, even though, as in the example, the square sections do not
  have to be all of the same size. Design a 4 × 6 Bento box, a 3 × 9 Bento box,
  and a 5 × 6 Bento box. Solution Here’s the 4 x 6 and the 3 x 9 And here’s the
  5 x 6 I hope you enjoyed these puzzles. I’ll be back in two weeks. Arigato!
  Tasty Japanese Morsels in Recreational Mathematics is published by the
  American Mathematical Association. All the diagrams above are taken from the
  book. I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I’m
  always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one,
  email me.
