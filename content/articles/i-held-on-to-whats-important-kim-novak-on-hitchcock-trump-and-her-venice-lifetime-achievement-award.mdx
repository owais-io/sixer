  She was the No 1 box office star in the late 50s, but for decades Kim Novak,
  the star of Alfred Hitchcock’s masterpiece Vertigo, has lived a life of quiet
  seclusion. Now, at the age of 92, the last of the great, glamorous movie stars
  of Hollywood’s golden era is back in the spotlight. She is being honoured with
  a lifetime achievement award at the Venice film festival, where a documentary
  about her life and career, Kim Novak’s Vertigo, is premiering. For Novak, it
  is a tribute not just to her acting but to her lifelong refusal to be
  controlled and manipulated by Hollywood, or anyone else. “It’s incredible to
  feel appreciated and to receive this gift before the end of my life,” she says
  in her unmistakable husky voice when we meet on Zoom. “I think I’m being
  honoured as much for being authentic as for my acting. It has sort of come
  full circle.” Novak’s haunting performance in Vertigo – as both Madeleine, an
  enigmatic society wife, and Judy, the ordinary shopgirl hired to impersonate
  her – is at the heart of what makes the film the greatest of all time. The
  fragile presence she brought to the parts was only possible because the story
  felt personal. “I identified so much with Judy and Madeleine because they were
  both being told to change who they really were,” she recalls. “They had to
  become something that didn’t represent them.” The actor’s devotion to
  preserving her identity can be traced back to her shy, introspective childhood
  and her early years in Hollywood. Born Marilyn Novak in Chicago to a railway
  dispatcher and a factory worker (both Czech immigrants), she grew up in a
  rough neighbourhood where she endured bullying for being different. She found
  refuge in art, studying at the Chicago Art Institute and supporting herself
  with modelling jobs. It was during a trip to Los Angeles that she was spotted
  by Columbia Pictures, who signed her in 1954. That’s when the transformation
  began. Harry Cohn, who infamously ruled the film production company with an
  iron fist, demanded that she change her name because there could be only one
  Marilyn in Hollywood, and “nobody’s gonna go see a girl with a Polack name”
  (she won a battle to keep her surname). He also shamed her into losing weight
  and had her teeth capped and her hair bleached. “They hired you because they
  thought you have something special, and then the first thing they’d do is try
  to give you a new face,” Novak recalls. “They’d want the mouth of Joan
  Crawford, the hair of Jean Harlow. So by the time you left the makeup chair,
  it wasn’t even you any more. I needed to fight to keep my own sense of who I
  was.” Novak is lively and energetic, with a remarkable memory and a ready
  sense of humour. It’s easy to understand why audiences were quickly mesmerised
  by her. Her breakthrough came with Picnic in 1955, which won her a Golden
  Globe, and she followed that with acclaimed roles opposite Frank Sinatra in
  The Man with the Golden Arm and Pal Joey – on which she performed My Funny
  Valentine. When Vertigo came along in 1958, Novak was 25 and at the height of
  her fame. On set, she found a rare creative freedom. “The thing I absolutely
  adored about Hitchcock was he allowed you to become the character in the way
  you saw fit. More insecure directors want to think for you, act for you, and
  therefore you have nothing to offer.” It also helped that her co-star, James
  Stewart, matched her emotional vulnerability, in an era when showy, theatrical
  performances were common. “Working with Jimmy was the greatest thing that
  could have happened to me. He was a reactor, not an actor, just like me. We
  bounced off each other.” By contrast, she found other actors difficult. Kirk
  Douglas, for example, was “constantly using moves and looks … he’d say: ‘I’ll
  show you the rhythm of the scene.’ It threw me. It was unnatural,” she
  recalls. Novak’s struggle to maintain her sense of self extended into her
  personal life, too. With Sinatra, work blurred into a romance that was heavily
  covered in the gossip pages. As was her clandestine love affair with Sammy
  Davis Jr, which ended after Cohn threatened Davis with mob violence, insisting
  it would be “bad for business” if Novak were involved with a Black man. Nearly
  70 years later, a new film, Scandalous!, directed by Colman Domingo, will
  dramatise that relationship, with Sydney Sweeney playing Novak. Novak does
  take issue with the title. “I don’t think the relationship was scandalous,”
  she says. “He’s somebody I really cared about. We had so much in common,
  including that need to be accepted for who we are and what we do, rather than
  how we look. But I’m concerned they’re going to make it all sexual reasons.”
  Despite Cohn’s coerciveness, or because of it, Novak feels the Columbia boss
  played a crucial role in Hollywood dynamism at the time. After his death in
  1958, she began receiving substandard scripts, which she describes as “painful
  and humiliating”. She made a few more quality films, including Bell Book and
  Candle, and Strangers When We Meet, but by the mid-1960s she had grown weary
  of the industry’s relentless pressures. “I feared becoming ‘Kim Novak’. Every
  time I played a role, I took on part of it. I was beginning to lose myself and
  what I stood for.” When her home in Big Sur was ravaged by fire and later
  destroyed in a mudslide, she took it as a sign that it was time to step away
  entirely. She relocated to Oregon, where she met and married Robert Malloy, an
  equine veterinarian, in 1976. “He was very authentic,” she says. “My mother
  said: ‘You should marry this man, he could ground you.’ And that was true.”
  Away from the glare of cameras and gossip, Novak also finally returned to her
  first love: painting. It became a lifeline during bouts of depression (Novak
  was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the early 2000s) and after the death of
  Malloy in 2020. “Art is the thing that saved me, I paint at least eight hours
  a day,” she says. “I miss Robert a lot. But living alone is satisfying for me.
  I learned from my mom that I had to be the captain of my own ship.” She has
  also found solace in her animals. “They could tell me more about me than I
  could. Like my goat: if I would dare wear a scent, he’d take his horns out and
  want to bite me, because he felt that it wasn’t me.” She has largely stayed
  out of the public eye, except for a rare appearance at the Oscars in 2014 when
  she presented two awards. But the experience was a painful reminder of why she
  had left Hollywood. For the event, Novak had fat injections in her cheeks, and
  the online reaction to her appearance was swift and cruel. Donald Trump joined
  the onslaught, tweeting that Novak should sue her cosmetic surgeon.
  (Coincidentally, the US president recently hailed Sweeney after it emerged she
  was a registered Republican). Novak was devastated by the criticism, but
  instead of shrinking she spoke openly about bullying and mental health. How
  does she feel about all of that now? “I’ve always had a strong feeling against
  bullies,” she says. “How I feel about the president has got nothing to do with
  what he said about me at the Academy Awards. I didn’t like what he said, and
  that’s when I spoke up about bullies. But since then he has become way more
  than just a bully. While I tolerated what he said and didn’t speak back to him
  on that, I will not tolerate what he’s telling me and everyone else to do.”
  “Dictatorships are taking over the world, including in the US,” she adds. “Too
  many people are not standing up for their rights and for what matters in life,
  like truth and honour and decency. For our democracy and freedoms. “I cannot
  tell you how strongly I feel about this. People are afraid to speak out, and I
  understand. But we’ve got to stand together and make ourselves heard.” That
  instinct that drives Novak to speak out now was present in the ways she
  challenged the system at the height of her career – including creating her own
  production company and going on strike over a salary that was lower than that
  of her male co-stars. Announcing her award, the Venice film festival director
  Alberto Barbera called her “a rebel at the heart of Hollywood”. Does she
  believe progress has been made for women in the industry today? “We make
  progress, but unfortunately then we always go back,” she says. “It inevitably
  always goes back to sex appeal. It still matters too much how we look. Social
  media and AI are able to show all kinds of stuff that isn’t real. They’re
  today’s bad directors, trying to remake women.” In Alexandre O Philippe’s new
  documentary, Novak revisits the shadows of her past. If her life has been one
  long journey of self-discovery, I wonder if it’s safe to say she has finally
  found herself. “Yes,” she says firmly. “I’m proud that I held on to what’s
  important. Of course there are many things I wish I had done differently, but
  they’re little things God and everyone else can forgive me for.” And how would
  she like to be remembered? She pauses. “I would like them to think that I was
  true to myself. That I kept my standards high and lived by them.”
