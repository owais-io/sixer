  Amazon has issued a rare statement reminding fans of The Summer I Turned
  Pretty to “keep the conversation kind” after online bullying against the
  actors in the hit romance series. “The show isn’t real but the people playing
  the characters are,” the show’s official social media accounts on Instagram,
  TikTok and X said on Wednesday. The caption accompanied a video graphic that
  reads: “The summer we started acting normal online.” On X the show’s account
  also reshared an earlier “PSA for the Summer community” posted before the
  season three premiere in July, which instructed fans that there was a “zero
  tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech”. Now on its eighth of 11
  episodes in its third and final season, The Summer I Turned Pretty has become
  a runaway hit for Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service – as well as
  attracting a vocal fanbase. Based on the novels of the same name by Jenny Han,
  the series follows Belly Conklin (Lola Tung) as she finds herself in a love
  triangle with two brothers competing for her attention: Conrad (Christopher
  Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). Online the fanbase is split into two
  warring camps – team Conrad v team Jeremiah. Many posts poke fun at the
  actions of each love interest as well as Belly’s wavering – though, as the
  show has moved towards its climactic finale, its stars and creators have
  spoken out about the sometimes vitriolic nature of the posts. “When people
  have an attachment to the characters, they want to see it come together at the
  end,” Tung told Teen Vogue in July. “But people get a little scary about it.
  Please don’t threaten to kill someone if something doesn’t go your way – I
  promise you, it’s not that serious.” A New York Times Q&amp;A last week asked
  Casalegno about playing “one of the internet’s most hated boyfriends” – to
  which he responded that he no longer checked Instagram. “Amazon did a good job
  of stepping in and being like, ‘Hey, no bullying,’” he said. “Though, not
  really going so well.” Variety reported that Casalegno had received public
  death threats for his role as Jeremiah as well as previous backlash over his
  social media activity, including for liking conservative political posts.
  Sources close to the production told Variety that Amazon had issued the
  warning as producers have seen “more opportunity for toxic behaviour online” –
  namely “anonymous, overly harsh criticisms”. Amazon’s statement comes one day
  after Han shared her own thoughts. “I know fans of the show are passionate and
  no one has bad intent,” the author wrote in an Instagram story on Tuesday.
  “But even in jest, posting images of a woman being slapped or choked is not
  funny.” The final season of The Summer I Turned Pretty ends on 17 September.
