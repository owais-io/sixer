  One of the benefits of a habitual tendency to say yes to anything that will
  get me on television is the unexpected friendships that can bloom on the
  dancefloor, in the jungle or, in this case, in the MasterChef kitchen. I was a
  contestant in 2016. Among the others was the England rugby international Neil
  Back, who had been part of the World Cup-winning squad of 2003 and could make
  a Russian oligarch’s close protection team look like the Cheeky Girls. I was
  not a noted sportsman in my youth – I have grown to enjoy watching sport but
  have never been at home in the culture of the clubhouse, the changing room or
  the training ground. However, Neil and I hit it off instantly. Within two days
  we were breaking into wardrobe to find out from the names on the aprons who
  our opposition would be. Within a week he was holding me aloft in an
  improvised lineout, a testament to his strength rather than my athletic grace.
  We talked about all sorts of things – shared life experience, unshared life
  experience – and one day he taught me something that changed my life. It is
  not an insight that others have not had. Indeed, it is obvious, a simple
  thing, but like so many obvious and simple things it is inexhaustibly
  difficult, too. It came up when we were thinking about which chips are best
  with burgers. I’m a french fry man myself, as slender and light as you like,
  but Neil goes for the chunky kind – cut immaculately, thrice cooked, then
  stacked as neatly as a Le Corbusier brise-soleil. I was struck by the intense
  focus Neil brought to this task, which he rehearsed over and over at home
  before we got to the kitchen. I asked why and he said: “Perfect practice makes
  perfect performance.” Of course it does, I thought, but then he said this was
  a mantra in the England team that won the World Cup. And of course, if Jonny
  Wilkinson had not practised and practised and practised kicking goals, we
  would have gone home as runners-up rather than winners. Perfect practice makes
  perfect performance, for what is a perfect performance other than practice
  that does not go wrong? I knew a bit about practice because I am a pianist and
  have been since childhood. I have practised countless pieces, scales and
  arpeggios, acquiring the 10,000 hours of experience that doing anything
  decently requires. But I was lackadaisical, and while I found it quite easy to
  execute some tricky passages, there were others that were too much for me –
  too quick, too dense, too complex to play accurately or musically. When I was
  young I used to busk my way through them, hitting the sostenuto pedal when I
  got to an unplayable bar to blur the inaccuracies. I would also affect what I
  thought were Lisztian flourishes at the keyboard as a distraction. I don’t
  suppose I fooled many people, but it got me through. When I ran away to London
  and joined a pop band, I had to learn to play in a different way. It is only
  now, in my 60s, that I have returned seriously to the classical repertoire I
  played in my teens. It is interesting to revisit who you were as a teenager 45
  years later, and discover what has endured and what has changed. What has
  endured for me is a deep love of music, and what has changed is a willingness
  to try to play it properly; not to busk my way through difficult passages but
  to face them squarely, break them down, put them together slowly and
  methodically, to practise and practise and practise, and to discover the
  obvious thing: if you practise, you get better. This has not only made me a
  better pianist than I was then, even if I am not yet back to peak technique;
  it has made me a better musician. By that I mean more patient, more focused,
  more willing to engage. It’s been a life lesson, too. I read a story recently
  about a man who visited Rachmaninov, the greatest pianist of his day, at home
  in Los Angeles. As he approached the front door, he could hear the great man
  practising in his music room. What titanic flourishes, what miracles of touch
  and dexterity poured forth? A chord of two notes, played very slowly, over and
  over and over again. Richard Coles is a writer, broadcaster and Church of
  England clergyman • The author’s footnote on this article was amended on 4
  August 2025. An earlier version said Richard Coles was a former Church of
  England clergyman; however, while he no longer has a parish, he still is a C
  of E clergyman.
