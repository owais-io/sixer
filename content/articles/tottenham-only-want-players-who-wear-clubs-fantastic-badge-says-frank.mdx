  Thomas Frank has made it clear that he only wants players at Tottenham who are
  committed to the club’s “fantastic badge” as the dust begins to settle on the
  Eberechi Eze saga. Spurs reached an agreement with Crystal Palace for the
  transfer of the England forward on Wednesday and believed they had one with
  the player as well. Yet hours later, Arsenal swept in to gazump them and are
  primed to confirm his arrival in a £67.5m deal. If it is a coup for Arsenal
  and a dream move for Eze, who supported the club as a boy, it has been an
  episode Spurs would rather forget. They failed in a bid for Nottingham
  Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White in July and are without their two main central
  attacking midfielders, Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison. Both have
  long-term injuries. Frank did not want to talk specifically about Eze at his
  press conference on Friday, which was ostensibly to preview Saturday’s Premier
  League visit to Manchester City. But he had a message for the club’s
  supporters and it was hard to think he did not have Eze in mind as he
  delivered it. “There has been a lot of links,” Frank said. “There’ll be a lot
  of links in the future. And just to generalise that … to make it very, very
  clear … I don’t want any players that don’t want to come to the club. Who
  don’t want to wear this fantastic badge. We don’t want them here. “That’s very
  clear and I’m also pretty sure that the fans will feel the same. If they [the
  signings] don’t want to put the fantastic shirt over their head, play for the
  badge, play for the club, really enjoy it, no problem. We don’t want them. I
  think that’s a key message.” Mikel Arteta refused to comment on the Eze deal
  as he prepared for the visit of Leeds on Saturday evening because the player
  was not yet a part of his squad. But the Arsenal manager did echo Frank in
  talking up the importance of signing players who identify with the club. “The
  number one thing is that they want to be with us, that they feel something
  special to come to us,” Arteta said. “We’ve done very well in the last few
  years to create a group of players and to build this spirit in the team and if
  they are supporting Arsenal, so much the better. The stronger the feeling, the
  better because it brings a different edge, a different will and an emotion to
  what you do. That always brings something extra.” Frank said he was confident
  of adding to his squad before the closure of the window and it sounded as
  though he knew it was essential to do so. He name-checked six options for his
  front line – the new signing Mohammed Kudus, Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke,
  Richarlison, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel. He did not include Manor Solomon,
  Kulusevski or Maddison. Frank was asked whether the group would suffice
  without reinforcements for a season that will include a Champions League
  return. “It’s a good question,” he said. “Of course we need to do everything
  we can to make sure we are as competitive as possible. I think we’ve got six
  good front players and then Kulusevski – he will come back in this season.
  That’s a big thing. It’s probably longer term with Maddison, unfortunately.
  But I am also pretty confident that we will sign a player before the end of
  the window.” Spurs have added João Palinha along with Kudus for the starting
  XI but they have lost Son Heung-min to Los Angeles Galaxy plus Maddison, who
  has ruptured his ACL, for the majority of the season. Is the squad stronger at
  present than it was last season? “You can say that’s two players in, two
  players out, so it’s probably pretty similar,” Frank said. “It’s up to me,
  together with the players and the staff, to make sure we can compete and then
  do what we can to strengthen.” Frank said Richarlison wanted to stay and that
  he wanted to keep him, in the face of rumours about the striker’s future.
  “There’s been no talks about anything else,” he said. Arteta, meanwhile,
  believes Arsenal will be better equipped across the attacking third this
  season. “More creativity, more weapons, having the ability to bring different
  profiles on the pitch at different stages in the game,” he said. “This is
  something that for sure we’re going to have more of this season.” The Palace
  manager, Oliver Glasner, praised the impact that Eze had for him after he took
  over from Roy Hodgson in February 2024, culminating in the famous winning goal
  against Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final. “I’m a big NBA fan and the
  crunch time is when the superstars are on the court,” Glasner said. “Ebs, in
  crunch time, when we needed him, he was here. This is what I will always
  remember. This is what great players are doing. We could count on Ebs in the
  crunch time, in the final, in the very important games. This is what he gave
  to Crystal Palace.”
