  Texas Democrats said on Thursday they are prepared to return to the state
  under certain conditions, ending a nearly two-week-long effort to block
  Republicans from passing a new congressional map that would add five GOP
  seats. The lawmakers said they would return as long as the legislature ends
  its first special session on Friday, which Republicans have said they plan to
  do. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will immediately call another
  special session. The Democrats also said they would return once California
  introduces a new congressional map that would add five Democratic seats,
  offsetting the gains in Texas. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, is
  expected to announce what he has teased as a “major” redistricting
  announcement on Thursday. Gene Wu, chair of the Texas house Democratic caucus,
  said in a statement that he and his colleagues “successfully mobilized the
  nation against Trump’s assault on minority voting rights”. “Facing threats of
  arrest, lawfare, financial penalties, harassment and bomb threats, we have
  stood firm in our fight against a proposed Jim Crow congressional district
  map,” he said. “Now, as Democrats across the nation join our fight to cause
  these maps to fail their political purpose, we’re prepared to bring this
  battle back to Texas under the right conditions and to take this fight to the
  courts.” The lawmakers said in a statement that returning to Texas would allow
  them to build a strong public and legislative record that could be used in
  legal challenges against the map.
