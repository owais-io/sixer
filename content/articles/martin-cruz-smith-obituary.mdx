  The opening image of Martin Cruz Smith’s 1981 novel Gorky Park – three
  faceless corpses breaking through a grey Moscow thaw – was unforgettable.
  Smith brilliantly gave his readers a metaphor for his Soviet detective Arkady
  Renko, an intelligent but dark investigator constrained to work within a
  bureaucracy that cannot even admit the presence of organised crime, and for
  the society around him that looks away from its truths. Published at the
  height of the Ronald Reagan cold war, the novel became an immediate
  bestseller. Critics compared Smith to Graham Greene and John le Carré in
  vision and subtlety. Gorky Park won the British Crime Writers’ Association’s
  Diamond Dagger as best novel of the year, but was overlooked for the US
  equivalent, the Edgar Allan Poe award. Michael Apted’s 1983 film, starring
  William Hurt as Renko and written by Dennis Potter, met with an opposite
  reaction. Smith thought it too much Potter, and one British critic dubbed it
  “Roubles in the Rain”. Renko appeared in 10 more novels, the last of them,
  Hotel Ukraine, published in July. Though Smith, who has died aged 82, may have
  seemed an overnight success, in fact he had been publishing for some years
  under various pseudonyms. He was born Martin Smith, in Reading, Pennsylvania.
  His father, John, was a factory worker and jazz sax player; his mother, Louise
  Lopez, was a jazz singer who played the clubs in Philadelphia. A onetime Miss
  New Mexico, she later became a Native American activist. Martin won a
  scholarship to Germantown academy in Fort Washington, and managed to get into
  the University of Pennsylvania to study sociology – but switched to creative
  writing. After graduating in 1964, he sold ice-cream over the summer to fund a
  European “art and romance” trip with his college sweetheart, Emily Arnold.
  They broke up in Rome; he went on to Spain and tried selling used cars to US
  servicemen. Smith returned to Pennsylvania and worked for Associated Press,
  covering the minutiae of everyday reporting. He moved to the more exciting
  tabloid Philadelphia Daily News, then in 1967 to New York to become editor of
  For Men Only, a cheesecake leftover from the 50s, with images of women in
  bathing suits and undergarments decorating adventure stories, true sex and
  crime, most of which Smith wrote himself, under pseudonyms. By now, he and
  Emily had reunited; and they married in 1968. When he was fired from For Men
  Only in 1969, they moved to Portugal, where he wrote a satirical novel about a
  young speechwriter to vice-president Spiro Agnew. Back in the US, the small
  paperback house Belmont published Smith’s first novel, The Indians Won (1970),
  a densely plotted alternate world sci-fi in which Sitting Bull’s victory over
  Custer launches an independent country in the middle of America; and bought a
  redone version of his Agnew book, which became The Analog Bullet (1972). A
  mainstream house, Putnam, published two thrillers about an art dealer named
  Roman Grey, which both gained Edgar nominations; Gypsy in Amber (1971) as best
  first novel and Canto for a Gypsy (1972) as best novel. Putnam had also bought
  the rights to Gorky Park after a pitch that included the promise of an
  American co-star for Renko. But by now, Smith had been inspired by the novels
  of the Scandinavians Per Wahlöö and Maj Sjöwall, which blended their morose
  detective Martin Beck with a sharp dissection of society in sometimes wintry
  Sweden, and his vision of his book had changed. While he argued with his
  editors about dropping the American detective from the story, he had a family
  to feed, so he took on as much pulp writing as he could, mostly under
  pseudonyms, and produced 17 novels in eight years under four different names,
  including three Nick Carter novels, and six as Simon Quinn about The
  Inquisitor, a former CIA agent turned hit man for the Vatican. Nightwing
  (1977) was the first Martin Cruz Smith novel. He took the name Cruz from his
  mother’s family, to separate himself from at least six other Martin Smiths
  (including, of course, himself). The novel mixed Hopi Native American
  mysticism into a tale of a plague spread by vampire bats; Cruz called the 1979
  movie, directed by Arthur Hiller, “the worst film ever made”. But his
  relations with Putnam had ground to a halt; at one meeting an executive sat
  clipping his toenails while Smith talked. The film advance allowed him to buy
  back the rights to Gorky Park; and his agent immediately sold them to a
  perceptive Random House for $1m. His next book, Stallion Gate (1986) told of
  the Los Alamos atom bomb project and the lives of his mother’s people in the
  New Mexico desert. His second Renko novel, Polar Star (1989), put the
  detective on a fishing ship during perestroika. Although he had made only one
  two-week trip to Moscow while writing Gorky Park, relying on friends and expat
  journalists to help out, Smith’s research for all his later books was copious,
  and often illustrated by his own drawings. Yet sometimes it seemed that his
  inner vision of Gorky Park was something that defied research. If none of his
  other novels matched Gorky Park’s success, many are very good. In his
  standalones, including December 6 (aka Tokyo Station in the UK, 2002), about
  an American nightclub owner about to flee Tokyo on the eve of Pearl Harbor,
  and Rose (1996), which moves between Somalia and the mine girls of Wigan,
  there is so much frenetic plotting and layered background as to overcome his
  own fine eye, like the ghost of his pulp plotter sitting down to write with
  him. In 1995, Smith had begun to show signs of Parkinson’s disease. Emily
  became first his research assistant, transcribing interviews and taking notes,
  and, later, his fingers as well, an interpreter of what he wrote as she
  watched words jump in his mind. She might be seen in Tatiana (2013), in which
  an interpreter plays a key part in the plot. In the penultimate Renko novel,
  Independence Square (2023), set in Ukraine on the eve of the Russian invasion,
  the detective shows signs of Parkinson’s. Speaking of the disease, Smith
  explained how he was able to keep working. “Sometimes, I don’t find the first
  word I’m after, but I’ll take the second word, or the third word. Because I
  like new ways of expressing things.” Smith is survived by his wife, daughters,
  Nell and Luisa, and son, Sam. • Martin Cruz Smith (Martin William Smith),
  writer, born 3 November 1942; died 11 July 2025 • This article was amended on
  1 August. The Gorky Park film did not win an Oscar for its screenplay.
