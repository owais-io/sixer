  The Trump administration has frozen $108m in federal research funding to Duke
  University after the federal government announced this week that it was
  investigating allegations that the school engaged in racial discrimination in
  the form of affirmative action, according to a person familiar with the matter
  and media reports. The National Institutes of Health reportedly halted the
  funding to the private university in North Carolina, said the person who spoke
  to the Associated Press on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss
  internal deliberations. CNN and ABC News also reported the funding freeze. The
  development came as, earlier this week, the Department of Health and Human
  Services and the Department of Education issued a joint letter to Duke,
  stating that it had been made aware of allegations of what it called racial
  preferences in Duke’s “hiring, student admissions, governance, patient care,
  and other operations”. Duke is the latest institution to have its federal
  funding held up as the government investigates allegations of antisemitism and
  policies that support greater diversity, equity and inclusion that the Trump
  administration alleges are unlawful. It follows other investigations by the
  administration into top-flight private universities, including the Ivy
  League’s Harvard, Columbia and Cornell. Duke did not immediately comment on
  the reported funding freeze. In Monday’s letter to Duke, the Trump
  administration states that it has been made aware of allegations that Duke
  University and Duke Health are engaged in practices that, “if true, would
  violate Titles VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section 1557 of the Affordable
  Care Act, and render Duke Health unfit for any further financial relationship
  with the federal government”. “These practices allegedly include illegal and
  wrongful racial preferences and discriminatory activity in recruitment,
  student admissions, scholarships and financial aid, mentoring and enrichment
  programs, hiring, promotion, and more,” the letter from the government states.
  The letter does not provide any specific examples. “Racism is a scourge when
  practiced by individuals, but it is especially corrosive when enshrined in the
  nation’s most eminent and respected institutions,” the letter, signed by the
  US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and the education secretary, Linda
  McMahon, adds. The letter orders Duke to end any practices at its health
  system that give “benefits or advantages” based on race. Saying Duke is
  unlikely to be capable of an “honest and trustworthy review”, the letter takes
  the unusual step of requesting a new merit and civil rights committee that
  would be approved by the government and authorized by the school’s board of
  trustees. The panel would be tasked with identifying and ending any racial
  preferences. If problems remained after six months, the administration would
  pursue legal enforcement, the letter said. The education department separately
  opened an investigation into the Duke Law Journal on Monday over allegations
  that it gave advantages to prospective editors from underrepresented groups.
  The Trump administration has used federal research funding as leverage in its
  unprecedented effort to reshape universities that Trump has described as
  hotbeds of liberalism. It has presented a crisis for universities that rely on
  federal grants as a major source of revenue, spurring some to take on debt and
  find other ways to self-fund research. Duke University spent $1.5bn on
  research last year, with nearly 60% coming from federal sources, according to
  the university’s website. Even before the latest funding freeze, Duke faced
  financial turmoil. Last week, university leaders said almost 600 employees had
  accepted voluntary buyouts but that layoffs would still be needed. Officials
  said they needed to reduce costs amid uncertainty around federal research
  funding and a hike to the university’s federal endowment tax. The Trump
  administration has been ratcheting up pressure on universities in hopes of
  striking deals such as one that Columbia University signed last week. The Ivy
  League school agreed to pay a $200m settlement over three years to the federal
  government and make changes to admissions, hiring, student discipline and more
  in exchange for regaining access to federal funding, among other things. In
  exchange for Columbia’s concessions, the White House will reinstate $400m in
  federal funding it had stripped from the university earlier this year over
  allegations that it allowed antisemitism to fester on campus. The Columbia
  deal was met with mixed reactions from students, faculty and alumni. The
  administration has described it as a template for other universities including
  Harvard, which has been in talks with the administration even as it battles
  the White House in court.
