  Arnold Schwarzenegger brags in his X profile that “I killed the Predator”, but
  even he was shocked when, as the freshly elected governor of California more
  than 20 years ago, he saw how unfairly the state’s electoral boundaries were
  carved up. One district in the eastern part of the state had such a long, thin
  middle section it was nicknamed the “swan”. Another was known as the “Jesus
  district” because you had to walk on water to get from one side to the other.
  Yet another, in LA’s San Fernando Valley, was memorably described by the
  Stanford law professor Pam Karlan as “a ghastly-looking, multi-headed,
  insect-like polygon with 385 sides”. This was the time-honored dark art of
  gerrymandering, practiced in state after state by whichever party happened to
  have a majority in the state legislature and wanted to keep things that way.
  To Schwarzenegger, though, a political neophyte after his long career as a
  Hollywood action hero, it looked a lot like election-rigging. “For a long time
  I thought that was something that happened way back in the 1800s,”
  Schwarzenegger said in a 2005 address to the state, “but the practice is still
  alive and well today.” What shocked Schwarzenegger was not that Democrats,
  then as now in control of the state legislature, were stealing seats from
  Republicans. (Decades earlier, Republicans had done much the same in the
  opposite direction.) It was, rather, that gerrymandering neutered the power of
  people’s votes. The year before his speech, in 2004, not a single one of
  California’s 153 congressional and state legislative seats changed party
  hands. “What kind of democracy is that?” he asked. It was an unusual question
  for any US politician to ask – most elected officials, of both parties,
  accepted gerrymandering back then as part of the price of doing business – and
  it set Schwarzenegger on a reformist path he has never relinquished. First, he
  proposed appointing a panel of judges to take over from the state legislature
  in redrawing district lines. When that was rejected by voters, he advocated
  instead for an independent redistricting commission, which began redrawing
  state legislative lines in 2008 and congressional district lines in 2010 – a
  reform that has proved enduringly popular with voters and has made California
  one of the most competitive states in the union for seats in the US House of
  Representatives. It’s a legacy Schwarzenegger has no intention of
  relinquishing, not even now that Texas Republicans, acting on the orders of
  Donald Trump, have redrawn their state maps to add another five
  Republican-leaning congressional districts, and California’s governor, Gavin
  Newsom, has vowed to “fight fire with fire” with an initiative to suspend
  California’s independent commission and add five Democrat-leaning districts in
  the Golden state. “I’m not going to go back on my promise,” Schwarzenegger
  told the New York Times last week. “I’m going to fight for my promise.”
  Schwarzenegger, a rare moderate Republican in an increasingly radical party,
  is an outspoken Trump critic and said he hated what the president had asked
  the Texas Republicans to do. But, he said, sinking to the same level in
  California was no answer, and it made no difference to him that Newsom was
  pitching his plan as a temporary arrangement. “We are not going to go into a
  stinking contest with a skunk,” he said. “We are moving forward.” To underline
  that he meant business, Schwarzenegger appeared for the interview – and later
  in a post on X – in a T-shirt that read: “F*** the politicians, terminate
  gerrymandering.” Thus the stage is set for a showdown between the current
  California governor, who will take his emergency redistricting proposal to
  voters in November, and the formidable former holder of the same office.
  Already, Schwarzenegger has started tapping into his old political networks to
  set up a campaign and fundraising machine to thwart Newsom, and according to
  his staff he is planning a major policy address – in effect, a campaign launch
  – sometime in September. The issue is energizing Republicans across
  California. Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker, has ambitions to raise
  more than $100m to defeat Newsom’s Proposition 50, also known as the Election
  Rigging Response Act. Charles Munger Jr, the billionaire son of Warren
  Buffett’s longtime business partner Charles Munger Sr, is reported to have
  pledged $30m towards the same effort. The California Young Republican
  Federation has described Newsom’s initiative as a “dangerous power grab” –
  echoing almost exactly Democratic rhetoric about the Trump-inspired
  gerrymander in Texas – and Steve Hilton, the leading Republican candidate
  running to succeed Newsom next year, is helping to spearhead a legal
  challenge. Hilton argues that the independent redistricting commission was
  already skewed unfairly in favour of the Democrats, since Republicans won a
  little under 40% of vote in California last November but hold just 17% of
  California’s 52 House seats. “If we had truly independent districting and fair
  representation, Republicans would have an extra 12 House seats today,” Hilton
  says, rounding the number in his party’s favour. (Commissioners would counter
  that he is overlooking a handful of highly competitive races in
  Republican-leaning districts that Democrats won by narrow margins.) The first
  polls on Newsom’s initiative are inconclusive, with voters seemingly split
  between liking independently drawn districts and a narrow plurality –
  especially Democrats – understanding the desire to counter what the
  Republicans are doing in Texas. Independents and Republicans are far more
  skeptical, if not outright hostile. Still, the campaign to stop Newsom will
  start at an inherent disadvantage, since Democrats have not lost a statewide
  election since 2006 and California voters, while not as liberal as Republican
  politicians sometimes like to portray them, have consistently shown a visceral
  dislike of all things Trump. Schwarzenegger is likely to be the most powerful
  weapon in the anti-Newsom arsenal, because he has no fondness for Trump and
  because his embrace of independently drawn electoral boundaries transcends any
  partisan allegiance. Since leaving office in 2010 he has campaigned in favour
  of independent commissions around the country – in states that lean both blue
  and red – and has spoken outside the supreme court when the justices have
  considered gerrymandering cases. He is also likely to serve as a bridge
  between Republican partisans and civic groups like the League of Women Voters
  of California, which views Newsom’s initiative as a slippery slope from which
  there may be no easy recovery. “Temporary exceptions rarely stay temporary,”
  the League warned in a statement. “Once you break a safeguard, you don’t just
  risk one or two or three elections, you set a precedent that future
  politicians can and will use again … Long-term damage to democratic norms will
  outlast any short-term gain.” California’s state legislature voted on Thursday
  to put Newsom’s initiative on the ballot but, after Texas voted to finalize
  its own maps, stripped out language that would have automatically abandoned
  California’s proposed partisan gerrymander if Texas chose to reverse course.
  Democratic lawmakers argued the escape clause was unnecessary because the
  Texas legislature had already acted. But scrapping it may also create the
  perception that Democrats, who enjoy a supermajority in the state legislature,
  have lost interest in playing fair – exactly the scenario Schwarzenegger
  warned against back in 2005. “The system is rigged to benefit the interests of
  those in office … not the interests of those who put them there,” he said
  then. “And we must reform it.” • This article was amended on 23 August 2025 to
  clarify that Republicans in California hold 17% of California’s 52 seats in
  the US House, not 17% of all the US House seats as an earlier version stated.
