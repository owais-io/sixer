  Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach’s drama starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam
  Driver as a divorcing couple engaged in a raging custody battle, won universal
  acclaim from critics and numerous awards, including six Oscar nominations and
  one win, for Laura Dern’s barnstorming attorney. But perhaps the highest
  honour has just been revealed by the Wall Street Journal, which reports that
  audio of the central couple screaming at one another has been judged so
  upsetting it is now being used to deter wolves from attacking livestock. “I
  need the wolves to respond and know that, hey, humans are bad,” a US
  Department of Agriculture district supervisor in Oregon told the WSJ. His
  teams employ “drone cowhands, whose quadcopters have thermal cameras that can
  reveal any wolf lurking in the darkness”. The predator is then spotlit and
  treated to audio blasted over a loudspeaker. Aside from Baumbach-scripted acid
  insults, tracks include fireworks, gunshots and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck. The
  practice is know as “wolf hazing” and is employed rather than culling as grey
  wolves are on the federal government’s list of endangered species. Happily,
  Driver and Johansson’s Academy Award-nominated performances have proved just
  as impactful for canines as humans. “Drones were deployed in the Klamath Basin
  of southern Oregon after 11 cows were killed by wolves there in a 20-day
  period,” reports the WSJ. “Over the next 85 days, when drones were on patrol,
  only two were killed.” Other emotionally volatile high-points in the 2019 film
  include Driver’s feeling rendition of Steven Sondheim’s Being Alive and Dern’s
  caustic broadside about the double standards by which mothers and fathers are
  judged (which found an echo in America Ferrera’s speech in the 2023 film
  Barbie, which was also co-written by Baumbach). It is not believed either of
  these moments are also being broadcast to pests. Marriage Story premiered at
  the Venice film festival in 2019 and was named on many critics’ best of the
  year lists, coming second on the Guardian’s year-end roundup. In his five star
  review of the film, Peter Bradshaw singled out the “central rage-filled
  confrontation” for praise. “This does feel theatrical,” he wrote, “but in such
  a lucid and intelligent way.”
