  A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed an unprecedented lawsuit filed by the
  Trump administration earlier in the summer against all 15 judges serving on
  Maryland’s federal district court – a case that opposed pausing some
  deportations from the state. In a 37-page ruling, US district judge Thomas
  Cullen of Virginia’s western district – who was nominated and confirmed to his
  position during Donald Trump’s first presidency – wrote that “any fair reading
  of the legal authorities cited by defendants leads to the ineluctable
  conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss”. “To hold
  otherwise,” Cullen added, “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart
  from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.” The
  Trump administration had challenged an order issued by Maryland’s chief
  district judge that temporarily barred the government from deporting
  undocumented immigrants for two business days if they filed challenges to
  their detention. Trump’s justice department argued that the order exceeded the
  court’s authority and violated federal law. But Cullen, who was nominated to
  the bench by Trump in 2020 and was assigned the case because all Maryland
  district judges were named as defendants, wrote that the judges were
  “absolutely immune” from lawsuits over their judicial actions. And Cullen said
  that instead of suing, the administration should have challenged the order
  though other legal channels, such as appealing against the order. “As much as
  the executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch
  of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power
  is not ordinary,” Cullen wrote. “In their wisdom, the constitution’s framers
  joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign. That
  structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and
  encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those
  disputes must occur in a manner that respects the judiciary’s constitutional
  role.” He added that if the administrations’s arguments “were made in the
  proper forum, they might well get some traction”. But he said that “as events
  over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times – at
  least regarding the interplay between the executive and this coordinate branch
  of government”. It was “no surprise that the executive chose a different, and
  more confrontational, path entirely”, Cullen’s ruling said. “Instead of
  appealing any one of the affected … cases or filing a rules challenge with the
  judicial Council, the executive decided to sue – in a big way.” In a footnote,
  Cullen also criticized the Trump administration’s attacks on judges across the
  country throughout his second presidency, which began in January. “Over the
  past several months,” he said, Trump administration officials had described
  federal district judges around the country as “left-wing”, “liberal”
  “activists”, “radical”, “politically minded”, “rogue”, “unhinged”,
  “outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional”, “[c]rooked,” and worse.
  “Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a
  hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive
  to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both
  unprecedented and unfortunate,” Cullen wrote. Among the judges named in the
  lawsuit was US district judge Paula Xinis, who ruled in April that the Trump
  administration had unlawfully deported Kilmar Ábrego García to El Salvador and
  ordered the US to return him.
