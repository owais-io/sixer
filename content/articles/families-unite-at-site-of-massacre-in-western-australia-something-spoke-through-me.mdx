  Warning: This article contains historical records that use racist and
  offensive language, and descriptions of events that will be distressing to
  some readers. It also contains references to Indigenous Australians who have
  died The trees have a voice here. A gentle whispering of the needle-like pins
  of the casuarina pines as they rustle in the winds. Some say if you walk by
  the banks of the Greenough River you might see the eyes of spirits glowing
  among the dense trees and shrubs. We’re on Naaguja country, about a 30-minute
  drive south from Geraldton, a coastal city in Western Australia. This spot is
  known by the traditional owners as Bootenal (pelican) Springs – and the
  namesake birds glide across the languid surface of the river. Despite the
  idyllic surroundings, no one wants to be here when the fading light turns
  black. A Naaguja man, Derek Councillor, speaks softly behind a thick grey
  beard. He drives along a bumpy dirt track, towards a closed-off field, his
  white Toyota four-wheel drive stained with the red dust of the surrounding
  hills. His granddaughter Kehlani sits in the front seat, her long brown hair
  underneath the borrowed wide brim of his Akubra hat. At the going down of the
  sun, Derek says, the wails of the children can be heard, followed by the cries
  of women and finally the men. “It’s scary at night-time,” he says. The farmers
  whose homes dot the surrounding hills, descendants of settlers to this region,
  have also heard the spirits and the dead, he says. “They’ll see a big fire
  burning, then they’ll come down to have a look,” Derek says. “Then they’ll get
  here and there’s no fire. They go back to their block, and then they’ll hear
  people singing and dancing, and then they’ll come and check it out again.
  There’s nobody there.” The Toyota bumps along, into the dusk. Bootenal Springs
  is a massacre site. One hundred and seventy years ago the river turned red
  with blood. The Naaguja people say their ancestors await their blood to be
  answered. “This is what we know,” says Derek’s cousin Theona Councillor. Her
  light brown eyes are warm, her voice calm but measured, each word carefully
  chosen. “This is our story, and we will tell it.” A ‘bad place’ The
  Councillors have heard the story since their childhood, passed down by Derek’s
  father. The knowledge was imparted with a shift of the eyes and a solemn
  warning about Bootenal as a “bad place” before, when Derek was a teenager, his
  father gradually expanded the story of bloodshed. In the early 1850s European
  settlers hungry for land had begun to stretch out from the port cities of
  Perth and Fremantle, encroaching on the territories of neighbouring tribes.
  They brought their families, cattle, crops and fences. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email They were taking up tens of thousands of hectares, clearing land,
  planting potatoes. “All of a sudden, our people couldn’t go there, they’d jump
  the fences … Sheep would go missing,” Derek says. Aboriginal people also began
  to go missing. The killings were sporadic at first. Settlers were angry with
  Naaguja for taking their livestock. The Naaguja, in turn, made threats against
  the settlers for encroaching on their lands. In the winter of 1854, John Nicol
  Drummond led a campaign against the Naaguja people. A self-appointed inspector
  of police, the botanist had learned local languages including Noongar and
  relied on intel he had gleaned to launch the attack. He gathered landowners,
  station hands and farmers to attack Naaguja families camped on the banks of
  the Greenough River. The story from Uncle Harold Councillor is that the
  settlers came over the hills from east to west at dawn, shooting as they went.
  The sun coming up behind them blinded the family groups who were camped
  staying there. The death toll is disputed. Officially, the settlers recorded
  that 30 men, women and children were killed. But the Councillors believe the
  toll was much higher. “Someone dropped a zero – it was at least 100,” Derek
  says. ‘Calls of their blood must be answered’ Theona has brought her daughter,
  grandchildren and cousins with her to Bootenal Springs on a bright warm day.
  They pick through the brush and scrub, avoiding the tangled roots and grasses.
  They are not alone. The Councillors and other Naaguja elders are meeting with
  the ancestors of the perpetrators – families descended from the founding
  settlers of the town. Theona has told Guardian Australia she will speak the
  truth. “This is what we know,” she says. “This is our story, and we will tell
  it and they are to listen. The calls of their blood must be answered.” Now, on
  the riverbank, she introduces her cousins Avriel Maher, Edna Corbett and Peta
  Watkins to the white families they have travelled to meet. “Margaret [is a]
  Criddle – her ancestor was one of the ones who rode in on the horses – and
  Amanda is the Drummonds,” Theona explains. “They’re coming for their side of
  the shield and we’re coming for our side.” Margaret Jones, born Criddle, and
  Amanda Rowland, born Drummond, are nervous. Amanda has driven here from her
  home in Cervantes, about 200km up the coast. This is not their first meeting
  with Theona and Derek, with the families having attended the 170th
  commemorations of the massacre last year. A circle of sand to mark the
  ceremonial dance is still there from that meeting, yet to be blown away by the
  winds. Plaques honouring the place and its history can be seen glinting in the
  sun. They are interpretative commemorations, created by the pioneers and the
  elders. Jones tells of the chill she felt arriving then, the sickness she felt
  in her stomach when standing by the casuarina she-oaks before the realisation
  hit: it was a killing ground. This was once a traditional camping site,
  abundant with bush foods. Families would spend nights clustered under the
  whispering trees, sheltering in a safe place to rest and hear Dreaming
  stories. The Bimarra Dreaming snake, a major creation spirit, once slithered
  its way through here. Derek gathers everyone in a clearing, under a large
  casuarina. Theona’s daughter and grandchildren listen attentively, nodding as
  the story unfolds. On the morning of the massacre, as the sun rose, the
  warriors were out hunting so it was mostly women, children and elders at the
  riverbank. “All the people were massacred in this spot here,” Derek says.
  “There was no mercy for anyone, all the women and children were killed that
  day.” He adds: “We don’t tell it with hate, we remember our past but don’t
  dwell on it.” But he points out that someone has gouged out selected words on
  one of the plaques. “Our people”, “our land” and “women and children were
  killed” have been struck through. Just days after we visited, more of the
  memorial was vandalised. Police are investigating. ‘I don’t want to lose that
  unsettledness’ There’s a saying in Geraldton: shake a tree and out pops a
  Criddle. The family has been in the region since the 1850s. But now those
  descendants are reckoning aloud with what the trees once whispered. Margaret
  Jones – “Auntie Marg” to Theona – is warm and quick with a hug. She’s quick to
  tears too. Her family’s involvement in the massacre was hidden over time. On
  the drive to the site, she says confronting that history has not been easy.
  “I’m a bit nervous, I have to say,” she says. “There’s still a whole raft of
  emotions. “I don’t want to lose that unsettledness in me – because if I get to
  a place where it becomes commonplace, then I will lose the part that my family
  members played here.” The group has come together thanks to Margaret’s cousin,
  George Criddle, who cracked open the family history books during PhD research.
  George began writing letters to their fifth-great-grandmother after being
  inspired by the Gumbaynggirr academic and historian Dr Gary Foley to “look in
  the mirror”. “I didn’t want to know this about my family, and I didn’t want to
  have that knowledge as a reflection on who I am and who my family is,” George
  says. It was something their father didn’t want to discuss, George says, and
  relations became strained. “That silence, that colonial silence, was just so
  obvious and so thick,” they say. They feared that opening up with their family
  about what they knew would lead to exile, anger or rejection: “That whole
  period, I was worried that I’d be kicked out.” Instead, it launched a period
  of greater understanding. Confronting that uncomfortable and contested history
  began a reckoning in not just the Criddle family but the wider community.
  Derek led a cultural tour. “It was really profound for my family,” Criddle
  says. “It was very difficult for everyone but it was also a release, because
  finally we’ve got the true history, or we’ve got connection to a history that
  had been silenced.” It’s a reckoning that has been years in the making. ‘I
  dropped six generations of shit’ We meet local historians and other curious
  community members at the Greenough Museum in Geraldton. Artefacts of
  colonisation are all around us. A gleaming wagon wheel and embroidered
  tapestries on the walls provide a thin veneer of genteel pioneering history, a
  backdrop to our circle of plastic garden chairs. Dusty enamelled canisters
  line the kitchen benches and heavy jarrah floors support a table long enough
  to seat a platoon. Amanda says that as a child she took pride in belonging to
  a “foundational family”. “I grew up feeling I was very, very special,” she
  says. “Information started to filter through as a teenager, when I realised it
  wasn’t all fabulous, brave pioneer stuff.” The commemorations of the 170th
  anniversary, and her subsequent work with Theona exploring the history through
  art, has allowed her to acknowledge that legacy and the benefits conferred
  upon her family for their role in frontier violence. “There was a war [that]
  my family did really well out of,” she says. “Here was an Aboriginal person
  and Naaguja people, inviting me to really look at this. It is just really
  profound for me. “I dropped six generations of shit, basically. The land, the
  people, something spoke through me.” She remains shaken by what she learned
  and is still learning. “I didn’t know that women and children were killed,”
  she says. Each time she visits the site, Drummond says, she is horrified anew.
  “You think you have heard it all and then,” she pauses. The wind also pauses,
  and the she-oaks stop talking. “I don’t know how I feel really, there’s always
  something to tip you over. But I thank the Councillors.” Theona understands
  being unmoored by history and its losses. “They’re losing their comfortable
  untruth – where it feels good and safe but it’s actually not the truth,” she
  says. “I think they need to release themself. They need to actively seek it,
  release it. We can’t do it for them. They have to do it.” Derek says the
  stories must keep being told. “We want to remember them today and that’s why
  we still tell their story,” he says. “We don’t let them fade off and disappear
  in history.” • Indigenous Australians can call 13YARN on 13 92 76 for
