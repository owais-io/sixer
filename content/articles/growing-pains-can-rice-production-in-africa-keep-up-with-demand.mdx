  Salmata Ouattara remembers 2023 as the turning point for her rice farm. June
  is usually the peak of the rainy season in Ivory Coast, but in the preceding
  years she and other farmers in M’Be on the outskirts of Bouaké, the country’s
  second biggest city, would wait weeks for rainfall. Then in September, they
  would watch helplessly as their farmlands were flooded. Some abandoned their
  farms, frustrated by fluctuating crop yields. For Ouattara, that was not an
  option. As her family’s breadwinner, proceeds from the farm catered to the
  needs of her three children as well as requests from other relatives. Then
  another farmer mentioned a concept called Smart Valleys that had helped solve
  similar issues and double his income. “Before, I made 2 tonnes a year [and]
  earned at least 400,000CFA [west African francs, equivalent to £528.60],” said
  Ouattara, who has since added maize, tomatoes and cucumbers to her portfolio.
  “But as soon as we put Smart Valleys into practice, I made 4.5 tonnes, which
  makes me 900,000CFA (£1,189.34).” Smart Valleys is a low-cost initiative by
  the nonprofit organisation Africa Rice that aims to help farmers get better
  control over the water on their land, for example by using channels, in order
  to reduce flooding and increase yields. It also helps farmers diversify crop
  production. The programme – backed primarily by Japan’s agriculture ministry –
  focuses on inland valleys, low-lying areas between hills with fertile soils
  that are ideal for agriculture but rarely cultivated due to poor water
  control. Its head, Elliott Dossou-Yovo, said the valleys cover 190m hectares
  in sub-Saharan Africa, of which only 10% is cultivated. “In the past, farmers
  were trying to produce rice only once a year and failing,” said Dossou-Yovo.
  With his team’s support, fields that used to be abandoned during the dry
  season are cultivated with alternative crops, thereby diversifying farmers’
  portfolios and increasing their incomes. Africa Rice, established in 1971, set
  a goal to double rice production within a decade in 2009, when it changed its
  name from West Africa Rice Development Association. Since achieving that
  target, it has ambitiously turned to self-sufficiency for member states by
  2030. The core of its work happens a few miles away from Ouattara’s farm at an
  800-hectare research campus, where there are facilities including testing
  sites, a seed science lab and gene bank with 22,000 rice varieties used by
  scientists to develop improved strains. Funders include the Gates Foundation,
  the World Bank, and donor partners including Islamic Development Bank and
  African Development Bank, though member states also make contributions. The
  need for Africa Rice arose because in the 1960s and 70s, rice consumption and
  population growth surpassed food production rate in west Africa, Baboucarr
  Manneh, its Gambian-born director general, said. Today, rice that was
  previously reserved for feasting occasions, is arguably the continent’s most
  popular staple. “Rice is very popular because it is easy to cook,” he said.
  “It used to seem like a luxury food to many consumers, compared with maize and
  millet. If you go to Sierra Leone, they used to consume a lot of roots and
  tubers etc, but people now associate those foods with poverty so they prefer
  rice.” Sali Atanja Ndindeng heads the rice sector development programme, which
  develops new varieties in conjunction with market trends and analyses samples
  received from partner institutions in member countries to help identify good
  grain quality. “Our goal is to make rice not just an energy-dense food, but a
  nutrient-dense food … and at the same time, reduce the impact of rice causing
  peaks in glucose levels when people consume it,” he said. One way to do this,
  the team thinks, is to promote the consumption of parboiled rice – which some
  studies have shown has a lower impact on blood sugar levels – in countries
  such as Ivory Coast, where it is historically unpopular, to mirror countries
  like Nigeria where it is prevalent. Ndindeng’s teams also make pop rice that
  can be ground to instant flour for children to eat with milk and chocolate as
  well as rice crackers integrated with local items including ginger, hibiscus,
  soy and tamarind which are high in zinc and iron, to tackle deficiencies in
  those micronutrients. Many barriers are holding back member countries from
  reaching self-sufficiency. For years, cheap imports have flooded African
  markets from Asia, where producers benefit from heavy subsidies. Africa
  imports about 40% of rice it consumes – about 15 to 16 million tonnes every
  year. More than half of the imports come from India alone. In July 2023, India
  banned rice exports, citing the need to consume more locally. “That created a
  panic in Africa,” said Manneh. “African ministers had to go to India to
  negotiate.” Only a fifth of rice fields in Africa use irrigation, with the
  rest relying on unpredictable rainfall, so member states are being guided on
  building climate-resilient systems. Tanzania is self-sufficient and exporting
  within east Africa. In west Africa, Nigeria, is close to doing so. Manneh is
  hoping for more success stories on a national level, but also on an individual
  level with farmers such as Ouattara, who are still stunned by what science is
  doing for their lives. “They welcomed me … They guided me and I thank them,”
  she said.
