  Major new research has found that men are paid more than women in 98% of
  occupations, with female workers in Australia typically paid 70 cents for
  every $1 earned by their male colleague after a decade in work. The report
  also showed that gender segregation in Australian workplaces was proving
  stubborn to shift: in about seven in 10 occupations there had been no progress
  on gender balance in 15 years. The 30% average pay gap across workplaces
  identified in Jobs and Skills Australia’s new report stretches to nearly 40%
  for First Nations women. Megan Lilly, a JSA deputy commissioner, said the fact
  that men were paid more than women on average in almost all of the 688
  occupations analysed in the landmark report was even more remarkable when
  considering the substantial range of workplaces where women dominate. Experts
  blame the persistent gender pay gap in large part on the “motherhood penalty”
  – the phenomenon where Australian women’s earnings drop by 55% in the five
  years after having their first child. A higher likelihood of returning to
  part-time rather than full-time work, and missed opportunities for promotion
  during time away, mean that penalty is only slightly improved 10 years after
  giving birth. Less than two weeks out from Jim Chalmers’ economic reform
  roundtable, Lilly said “politicians and policymakers need to grapple with
  these findings and find strategies and policies to deal with economic
  inequality”. “Gender occupational segregation is actually a handbrake on our
  economy.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email More gender-balanced occupations
  tended to have more equal pay, but the research revealed these jobs were in a
  minority: only one in five Australian workers were in occupations with a
  relatively equal mix of men and women. Ambulance officers and paramedics,
  dentists, and barristers were roles that had become less male-dominated, while
  vets and school principals had moved from gender parity to moderately higher
  shares of women. But gender segregation was most acute in lower-skilled
  occupations, where there had been little change in the mix of men and women in
  a decade-and-a-half. While no occupation showed meaningfully higher pay for
  women over men, the report found that occupational pay gaps widen to be at
  their worst among the most segregated occupations – regardless of whether they
  were male- or female-dominated. Female registered nurses, for example, were
  paid $89,720 on average, or 21% less than the $114,420 typically paid to their
  male peers. That’s despite women accounting for 90% of that workforce and only
  working 10% fewer hours. Even in the case of childcare – where almost the
  entire workforce were women – men were typically paid 14% more: $56,240,
  versus $48,340, according to the JSA’s analysis of Australian Taxation Office
  data. Amid a nationwide shortage of workers in key areas of the economy, the
  report also showed that the most gender segregated occupations – such as in
  blue collar construction, and “pink” collar nursing and aged care – were also
  where these labour shortages were at their most acute. Lilly said essentially
  excluding half of the population from certain occupations was part of the
  problem. “Gender segregation is exacerbating skill shortages, exacerbating the
  pay gap, and too many cohorts of women are disadvantaged. And this is all at
  the expense of a more inclusive and productive society,” she said. “Fix
  segregation and you fix occupational shortages and gender pay gaps.”
