  ‘You can’t run a certification based on vibes’ – does B Corp still signal a
  business that cares?

  Princess Polly, available on Asos in the UK, has a lot in common with other
  ultra-fast fashion brands. Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and
  PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind
  of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time
  of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a £6 pink mini
  dress to an £82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for £3 and
  barrel-leg jeans from £8. But there is one key difference between Princess
  Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing
  the certification’s integrity into question. B Corp is the world’s most
  recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception
  in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its “high standards of
  social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,”
  including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for
  “beneficial”. The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to
  caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long
  verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by
  measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers.
  However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a
  buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that
  doesn’t seem to align with B Corp values. Dale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral
  certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says
  the news left her “deeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.” “[Now]
  it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick
  enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor
  to environmental damage,” she says. Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand
  designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly’s business model, which
  relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. “It contributes to a
  hyperconsumerist culture,” says its managing director, Emma Wallace. “The root
  [problem] of overproduction … needs to be addressed.” A new report from the
  Apparel Impact Institute (pdf) attributes the apparel industry’s 7% emissions
  increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin
  polyester. On its website, Princess Polly says: “We’re on a mission to make
  on-trend fashion sustainable”, and notes it has introduced a range of
  measures, including using “lower-impact materials” such as recycled polyester
  and organic cotton in 30% of its “new arrivals”. Sustainability campaigners
  and industry observers voice scepticism. “It’s greenwashing,” says Alden
  Wicker, the founder of the Substack EcoCult, which reports on sustainability
  issues in the industry. “You can’t run a certification like this based on
  vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and
  consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.” B
  Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess
  Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually
  associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded
  soap company Dr Bronner’s dropped the certification, stating: “Sharing the
  same logo and messaging … [with] companies with a history of serious
  ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social
  certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us”. David Bronner, the
  company’s CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. “It’s
  just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if
  that’s your product offering, then that’s inherently not better for the
  world.” Princess Polly says it’s “proud of its environmental, social and
  governance progress”, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical
  sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a “valid
  ethical manufacturing audit”) and environmental impact (it has pledged to
  reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant
  (you can read its policy here) and it only has a vague commitment to paying
  living wages. In a statement provided in response to specific questions about
  Princess Polly’s certification, B Lab, the business behind B Corp, wrote: “B
  Corp certification is holistic; it doesn’t evaluate a product or service, nor
  is it exclusively focused on a single social or environmental issue.” With
  about 10,000 companies certified, now including various well-known
  multinationals, B Lab says the movement is “intentionally diverse”. But to
  some, this broad-church approach reveals another shortcoming. “If your theory
  of change is engaging big and questionable players and helping them be
  marginally better, you need to distinguish companies that are going way beyond
  that,” says Bronner. Companies that apply for status answer more than 200
  questions to measure positive impact across governance, workers, community,
  environment and customers, and are then given a score. The minimum score for
  certification is 80 points but critics point out a business can be weak in one
  area and make up for it in another. Businesses must reapply for certification
  after three, and then five, years. At least some of the contention is with
  using a points-based system that brands can leverage by hiring consultants
  able to help them navigate the application process. In other words, says
  McCarthy: “large companies can afford teams of lawyers and document writers”,
  which are resources less likely to be available to smaller businesses. Change
  is coming. After a five-year consultation process, the certification is due to
  be updated next year. Under B Lab’s new standards, companies will need to meet
  minimum requirements across seven areas including: climate action,
  environmental stewardship and circularity. Since 2024, the sustainable fashion
  designer and activist Amy Powney has been pursuing B Corp certification for
  her new label, Akyn. She says the new B Corp standards are more onerous for
  circularity, waste, overproduction and human rights, so “it will be
  interesting to see if [Princess Polly] pass in three years”. As for the
  ongoing desirability of the B Corp label and its ability to signal brand value
  to conscious consumers, the jury remains out. Powney will still apply and at
  Kowtow the certification remains useful. “It has empowered our team to work on
  the tough stuff, ask questions of our suppliers and collaborate on solutions,”
  says Wallace. For Bronner, who won’t be returning, the new standards are
  “directionally getting better but still failing in certain fundamental ways”.
  Bondi Born’s McCarthy remains sceptical: “I’ll wait and see whether B Corp as
  a brand continues to dilute itself until it’s meaningless – or not.” To read
