  “Still haven’t seen the Rolling Stones,” says Venus Williams, smiling, as she
  reminisced about her unforgettable professional tennis debut at the age of 14
  in Oakland, California, an occasion that justified years of hype surrounding
  her stratospheric potential. Her first ever professional tennis match took
  place next door to a Rolling Stones concert. Now, 31 years later, at 45 years
  old, Williams is still here. Three weeks after returning to professional
  tennis for the first time in 16 months with a straight sets singles victory
  over the then world No 35 Peyton Stearns at the Citi Open in Washington, which
  marked her as the second-oldest woman in history to win a WTA Tour-level
  singles match and also silenced criticisms about her enduring presence on the
  tour, Williams now takes her comeback to the Cincinnati Open. Once one of the
  most precocious youngsters of her time, a US Open finalist by the age of 17,
  Williams continues to compete. She is one of the greatest tennis players of
  all time in her own right, a seven-time singles grand slam champion, Olympic
  gold medallist and former No 1 in singles. Despite all she has achieved, her
  enduring love for her sport means she continues to step on the practice court
  every day with the aim of being the best player she can be. “Love is the key,
  right?” says Williams. “If you don’t love it, then get out of it. If you can,
  if you have that luxury, not everyone has that luxury. For me, I think a lot
  of the motivation for me is just to come back and try to play in the best
  health that I can. “I never stopped hitting the ball, even when I was away,
  not as intensely as you would if you were playing tournaments, but I was still
  going out there. And I think that at the end of the day, you have to live your
  life on your own terms. Your terms should be yours. Doesn’t matter what anyone
  else says or what anyone else thinks, if you get to live life on your own
  terms of life, [do] that. And I firmly believe in that.” This comeback,
  however, is not merely about striking a tennis ball. Last month, Williams
  revealed she has suffered with fibroids for years, non-cancerous tumours that
  develop in and around the uterus, which left her with excruciating symptoms
  including pelvic pain and heavy bleeding. In addition to the significant
  impact fibroids has had on Williams’ everyday life, it also affected her
  tennis career. She says she had been misdiagnosed for years. Last week, in the
  aftermath of her returning in Washington, Williams posted a series of videos
  from exactly a year ago when she was undergoing an open myomectomy surgery to
  remove the fibroids and a large focal adenomyoma in her uterus, tissue from
  the lining of the uterus that had grown in her uterine wall. “I was told I was
  inoperable,” she wrote. “I was told I could bleed to death on the table. I was
  told to get a surrogate and forget the hope to carry my own children. I was
  misdiagnosed. I went untreated for years and years and years.” As she has
  returned to the court, Williams has used the publicity around her return to
  shine a light on women’s medical issues. “I just remember after my surgery, I
  was feeling so much gratitude but I was able to have the resources to finally
  get through that, and I remember that was the biggest feeling that I had. And
  at that point, I was nowhere near playing professional tennis, but now a year
  later, I’m in a completely different space, and I have a clean bill of health,
  thank God, and I’m ready to play and compete.” The next competitive challenge
  for Williams will be the 22-year-old world No 51 Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro. On
  the day Bouzas Maneiro was born, 24 September 2002, Williams had already won
  four grand slam singles titles, reached No 1 and contested the previous three
  consecutive major finals against her younger sister, Serena. The elder
  Williams sibling said the US swing was the focus for her return and she is
  unlikely to compete after the US Open. The rest is unknown. “I’m very much in
  the moment,” she said. “I don’t think you should ever rule me out. That’s all
  I can say.”
