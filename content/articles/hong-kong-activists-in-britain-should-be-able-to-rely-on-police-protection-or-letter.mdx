  The UK has become a hunting ground for authoritarian regimes targeting
  dissidents, journalists and students. It is appalling that Hong Kong activists
  who sought refuge here met fear, harassment and intimidation from the
  government they had escaped, only to receive inadequate protection and little
  coordinated response (Hong Kong democracy campaigner accuses UK police of
  asking her to ‘self-censor’, 1 August). Amnesty International has repeatedly
  documented the Chinese government’s transnational repression, including the
  surveillance and intimidation of students and activists here in the UK. This
  includes an alarming escalation in threats against the Hong Kong community,
  with bounties placed on the heads of UK-based pro-democracy activists. Last
  week, parliament’s joint committee on human rights issued a report exposing
  major gaps that are putting Hong Kong and Chinese activists’ freedom at risk,
  including the lack of a clear definition of transnational repression, patchy
  police responses, no dedicated reporting mechanism, and failure to collect
  even basic data on the scale of the threat. Initial steps taken by the
  government to address transnational repression are welcome, but the recent
  police response, as illustrated by your report, exposes the huge gap between
  policy and practice. The police must be given more extensive and consistent
  training to increase their awareness of these incidents and must act to
  protect Carmen Lau and other activists’ right to free speech – they must not
  be complicit in silencing them. The government must now act on the above
  recommendations from the committee’s report. Protections must be real, visible
  and trusted by those they are supposed to serve. It must work with affected
  activists and communities to define transnational repression, track it and
  confront it, before silence becomes the new norm. Sara Rydkvist Hong Kong
