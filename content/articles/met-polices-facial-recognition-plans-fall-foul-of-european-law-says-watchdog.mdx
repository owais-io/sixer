  Scotland Yard’s plan to widen the use of live facial recognition technology is
  unlawful because it is incompatible with European laws, the equalities
  regulator has said. As the UK’s biggest force prepares to use instant
  face-matching cameras at this weekend’s Notting Hill carnival, the Equality
  and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said its use was intrusive and could have a
  “chilling effect” on individuals’ rights. The development will be a blow to
  Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, who has backed the use of
  the technology at mass events such as this weekend’s carnival, which 2 million
  people are expected to attend in west London. The EHRC has been given
  permission to intervene in a judicial review launched last month by the
  anti-knife campaigner Shaun Thompson. Thompson, a black British man, was
  wrongly identified by live facial recognition (LFR) as a criminal, held by
  police, then faced demands from officers for his fingerprints. Data seen by
  the EHRC shows that the number of black men triggering an “alert” by the
  technology is higher than would be expected proportionally when compared with
  the population of London, it said. A letter last week from 11 anti-racist and
  civil liberty organisations, disclosed in the Guardian, urged the Met to scrap
  the use of the technology over concerns of racial bias and the impending legal
  challenge. LFR technology captures and analyses the faces of individuals
  passing in front of real-time CCTV cameras. It extracts unique biometric data
  from each face and compares it against a “watchlist” of thousands of people
  sought by the police. There is at present no specific domestic legislation
  regulating police use of LFR, with police using common law powers instead. The
  Met insists that the Equality Act 2010 places legal obligations upon them to
  eliminate discrimination. The EHRC said that the claim brought forward by
  Thompson “raises issues of significant public importance” and will provide
  submissions “on the intrusive nature of LFR technology” which focus on the way
  in which the technology has been used by the police. The Met’s policy on LFR
  technology was unlawful because it was incompatible with articles 8 (right to
  privacy), 10 (freedom of expression), and 11 (freedom of assembly and
  association) of the European convention on human rights, the watchdog said.
  Rebecca Vincent, the interim director of Big Brother Watch, said the EHRC’s
  intervention was “hugely welcome”. She added: “The rapid proliferation of
  invasive live facial recognition technology without any legislation governing
  its use is one of the most pressing human rights concerns in the UK today.
  Live facial recognition surveillance turns our faces into barcodes and makes
  us a nation of suspects who, as we’ve seen in Shaun’s case, can be falsely
  accused, grossly mistreated and forced to prove our innocence to authorities.”
  John Kirkpatrick, the chief executive of the EHRC, said: “There must be clear
  rules which guarantee that live facial recognition technology is used only
  where necessary, proportionate and constrained by appropriate safeguards. We
  believe that the Metropolitan police’s current policy falls short of this
  standard.” The Met said last month it would deploy specially mounted cameras
  at entries and exits of the two-day event in west London. Rowley wrote on
  Tuesday that the technology would target the “small minority” who committed
  serious crimes, including violence and sexual offences. A spokesperson for
  Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “The mayor is committed to working
  closely with partners to help deliver a safe and welcoming Notting Hill
  carnival for all. “All live facial recognition deployments are an operational
  decision for the Met. “The mayor is committed to ensuring the Met is open and
  transparent around where, when, why and how live facial recognition technology
  is used. Sadiq and his Office for Policing and Crime will scrutinise and
  oversee its use to ensure there’s trust and confidence in policing as we
  continue to build a safer London for everyone.” Alba Kapoor, racial justice
  lead at Amnesty International UK, said: “The Equality and Human Rights
  Commission’s intervention is absolutely correct. Facial recognition technology
  has been proven repeatedly to be discriminatory, being less accurate in
  scanning the faces of people of colour and leading to wrongful arrest, causing
  distress and harm. These systems violate our right to privacy, our rights to
  freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, and to equality and
  non-discrimination. “No matter who we are, we should all feel safe to move
  freely without risk of harassment or false arrest. The Met’s plans to use this
  dangerous and discriminatory tool of surveillance should be immediately
  scrapped.” A Met spokesperson said: “We believe our use of LFR is both lawful
  and proportionate, playing a key role in keeping Londoners safe. We welcome
  the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s (EHRC) recognition of LFR’s
  potential in policing. “The Court of Appeal has confirmed the police can use
  LFR under Common Law powers, with the Met carefully developing a policy to
  operate the technology in a way which protects people’s rights and privacy.
  “As part of this model, we have strong safeguards in place, with biometric
  data automatically deleted unless there is a match. Independent research from
  the National Physical Laboratory has also helped us configure the technology
  in a way that avoids discrimination.” The former senior Met officer in charge
  of Brixton, Lord Paddick, who is now a non-executive adviser to the force,
  previously said that he welcomes the use of LFR technology at carnival. “The
  Met doesn’t get everything right, but I trust those responsible for the
  development and deployment of live facial recognition, and compared with other
  police crime prevention measures, such as blanket, no-suspicion stop and
  search, it is much less intrusive,” he wrote.
