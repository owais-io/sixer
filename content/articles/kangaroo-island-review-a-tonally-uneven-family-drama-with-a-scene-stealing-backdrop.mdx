  I suppose it was just a matter of time before an Australian film arrived
  called Kangaroo Island. That title certainly has an air of exportability –
  and, in director Timothy David’s drama about family and home, an emotional
  double meaning. The “island” represents psychological places in which we
  strand ourselves, and the “kangaroo” represents the ways we hop over our … um
  … oh, who am I kidding? There’s no double meaning: it’s just the name of the
  actual island, located south-west of Adelaide, where most of the story takes
  place. But this film certainly has international audiences in mind, beginning
  in Los Angeles where we meet Lou (Rebecca Breeds), an actor who some time ago
  caught the proverbial midnight train from Kangaroo Island and arrived in
  Tinseltown with big dreams. She’s had a few gigs, but is in a career slump
  when she receives a plane ticket back home from her father, Rory (Erik
  Thomson). Lou has no intention of actually going but, when engaged in an
  awkward situation with a police officer who pulls her over, uses the ticket to
  prove she’s in a rush. This leads to the first of several plausibility
  stretching moments: the cop insists on giving her a lift to the airport. I
  assume this would be a breach of protocol at the very least – are cops even
  allowed to be that helpful? The next comes at the airport, where Lou decides
  to kill time by getting smashed at a bar. The film cuts to her waking up from
  a nap and uh-oh, she’s on the plane back home! Meaning she has drunk enough to
  board without really wanting to, but sober enough to be allowed on the flight?
  Authenticity is everything in a modestly staged, relationship-centric drama
  like this; the last thing this film needs is for us to question whether it’s
  believable. These moments are miscalculations by screenwriter Sally Gifford,
  though the film steadies when Lou arrives home, deploying several characters
  with whom she has complex longstanding relationships. These include her
  father, her born-again sister Freya (Adelaide Clemens) and her ex-boyfriend
  Ben (Joel Jackson), who is now Freya’s husband. Sign up for the fun stuff with
  our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every
  Saturday morning Ben’s a bit of a douchebag, prone to making unhelpful
  confessions about still having feelings for Lou. I didn’t quite buy this
  character; he felt more like a device for dramatic conflict than a person per
  se. But Lou, Freya and Rory are well developed and multifaceted. For me, the
  relationship between the two sisters was the highlight: a very authentic
  depiction of starkly different people – Lou being the more freewheeling,
  outgoing kind – with lots of hot emotions and unresolved issues between them.
  Breeds, a former Home and Away star, gives Lou multitudes, crafting a
  character who’s headstrong but vulnerable, and has a dangerous edge. You can
  feel she’s capable of turning her life around but also sense she might go off
  the rails and pull others down with her. Boosted by strong supporting
  performances from Thomson and Clemens, Breeds elevates a film that has quite a
  lot going for it but is tonally uneven; it can feel genuine one moment and
  confected the next. Some story developments are naturalistically divulged,
  such as the real reason Rory wanted Lou back on the island, which emerges
  around the dinner table at their family home – situated a stone’s throw from a
  stunning beach (cue lots of pretty shots and visual scaffolding). Others feel
  much more contrived. Kangaroo Island has so few settings that, when Lou makes
  a trip to the general store, you can feel something is up; this trip must have
  special narrative significance. Indeed, an important plot development is
  divulged there that relates to the future of the family property, exacerbating
  tensions between Lou and Freya. Sometimes I thought Kangaroo Island was about
  to devolve into Hallmarkian slosh and lose me completely, only for David (a
  first-time feature film-maker) to get me back on side, more or less, by
  creating small moments that really resonate. Kangaroo Island is in Australian
  cinemas from 21 August
