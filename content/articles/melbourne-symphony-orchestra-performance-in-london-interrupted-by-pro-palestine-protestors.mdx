  Melbourne Symphony Orchestra performance in London interrupted by
  pro-Palestine protestors

  Pro-Palestine protesters have interrupted a performance by the Melbourne
  Symphony Orchestra (MSO) at the BBC Proms in London, accusing the
  organisation’s management of silencing artists who have criticised Israel’s
  conduct in Gaza. The Jewish Artists for Palestine group interrupted the
  performance for more than 10 minutes on Friday night, with some members
  shouting from the upper stalls of Royal Albert Hall, including claims the MSO
  “silenced artists” and “silenced protest”. Videos uploaded to social media of
  the protest show some members of the group carrying a sign with the “Jewish
  Artists for Palestine” name and another reading “complicit in genocide”. “The
  MSO has blood on its hands,” one protester shouted during the interruption.
  “You silenced Jayson Gillham.” In a statement, the Jewish Artists for
  Palestine said “we reject Zionist funding, censorship and complicity in our
  cultural institutions”. The MSO has been contacted for a response to the
  protest and the claims made. Gillham, an acclaimed pianist, is suing the MSO
  over a cancelled Melbourne concert he was contracted to perform at on 15
  August 2024. Gillham claims the event was cancelled in an attempt to silence
  him over his stance on the crisis in Gaza. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Shortly before his cancellation was announced, at a previous concert Gillham
  had played a short piece called Witness, composed by Australian multimedia
  artist Connor D’Netto, which was dedicated to journalists who had lost their
  lives in the Gaza conflict. While introducing the work, Gillham addressed the
  audience, stating more than 100 Palestinian journalists had been killed, and
  that the targeting of journalists in a conflict was a war crime under
  international law. In an email sent to patrons, the MSO said Gillham would no
  longer perform on 15 August because of “a series of introductory remarks” made
  without MSO’s “approval”. “The MSO does not condone the use of our stage as a
  platform for expressing personal views”, the email said, adding that Gillham’s
  remarks had caused “distress”. The MSO subsequently issued a statement denying
  Gillham had been discriminated against because of his political views, saying
  the action management took in response to the artist’s on-stage comments was
  “not and never has been about free speech”. But MSO management also said it
  had made “an error” in cancelling the performance, saying “we have been
  engaging constructively with Jayson and his management and are seeking to
  reschedule the concert”. On Friday, the interruption was met with booing by
  some sections of the crowd. The BBC, which broadcasts the performance,
  apologised for the disruption. The BBC spoke to one audience member, Angela
  Tanner, who said it took security “quite a while” to remove the protesters.
  “The whole programme had to start again and has been put into a different
  order after the piano was put on to the stage and taken off again,” she told
  the BBC. In a statement reported by the BBC, the broadcaster said “there was a
  disturbance at tonight’s Prom which meant the concert was paused for a few
  minutes and the live broadcast on BBC Radio 3 diverted to pre-recorded music”.
  “The incident was dealt with swiftly by the Royal Albert Hall. “Our priority
  is always the safety and wellbeing of everyone who attends the BBC Proms, and
  we would like to thank our staff and the performers whose response helped keep
  disruption to a minimum,” the BBC spokesperson said. In May, the federal court
  ordered Gillham’s case to proceed to trial, which is scheduled to begin on 1
  December. Gillham was contacted for comment.
