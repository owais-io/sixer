  Australians are starting to spend a little more as household budgets recover
  and interest rates and inflation ease, the country’s biggest companies have
  said. ASX-listed businesses have reported their earnings through August,
  showing rising customer spending on overseas flights, pints at the pub, and
  running shoes. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Those aged 20 to 34 spent more
  on non-essential goods in the three months to June than they had a year before
  when they were cutting back, Commonwealth Bank reported. Meanwhile, growth in
  non-essential spending doubled among 35 to 54-year-olds. Shopping remains weak
  across the board, but CEOs mentioned “green shoots” in a few key areas. Here’s
  where Australians have upped their spending as incomes recovered.
  International travel International flights boomed in the year to June, as
  customers turned from local holidays to overseas adventures. Qantas Group
  carried 1.8 million more passengers in the first half of 2025 than it did in
  the first half of 2024. The single biggest contributor to that was a
  730,000-trip jump in Jetstar international flights. Jetstar’s domestic flights
  saw the biggest increase in trips than any other Qantas Group branch the
  previous year, when Australians’ appetite for overseas travel was under
  pressure from surging air fares as pandemic restrictions lifted and the rising
  cost-of-living. The budget carrier’s popularity shows money remains front of
  mind, with Qantas forecasting 12% growth for Jetstar international and 8% for
  Qantas international. Flight Centre reported surging travel in June and July
  to countries in Australia’s region, including China, Japan, New Zealand and
  Vietnam, rather than long-haul destinations, which the company attributed to
  budget consciousness along with efforts to avoid the Middle East and the US.
  Webjet reported lower domestic holiday bookings and rising international
  bookings. Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed locals took a million
  more short-term trips overseas in the year to June than they did the year
  before. Pub nights Growing crowds have bought pints and pub feeds during
  sports seasons, even as general alcohol spending slows, the country’s largest
  hotel owner reported. Endeavour Group’s 350 venues saw sales growth double in
  the year to June, running higher than 4% after picking up less than 2% in the
  previous 12 months, with chief executive Kate Beattie calling it a “buoyant
  market”. “We do see pubs really enjoying a renaissance as a destination for
  socialising,” she said. Beattie said spending momentum surged in the first
  half of 2025 and carried through to August with a boost from the British and
  Irish Lions rugby union tour, which Commonwealth Bank and NAB also noted. “We
  saw particularly Guinness sell well during that event period, which probably
  reflects the demographic that was actively enjoying the festivities,” Beattie
  said. Bega, which sells cheese and other dairy products to pubs and clubs,
  reported an increase in pub meal purchases. Runners Sports footwear sales
  boomed as run clubs exploded in popularity and marathons sprang up around the
  country, with leading chains Rebel and The Athlete’s Foot recording strong
  sales. Rebel reported especially strong sports footwear sales, helping its
  overall sales pick up by nearly 5% or about $60m. The Skechers, Hoka and
  Merrell sports shoe brands reported strong sales through the year, with parent
  company Accent Group’s chief executive, Daniel Agostinelli, pointing to sport
  fashion’s rising popularity. “A lot of it is sport-inspired and that’s sort of
  what the market’s wanting at the moment, and that’s starting to bleed into the
  lifestyle space,” Agostinelli said. Lifestyle and fashion sneakers have been
  slower to regain customers, with Accent writing down the value of skate shoe
  brand Vans by nearly $4m and struggling to boost growth at sneaker chain
  Platypus. Nintendo Switch 2 The Nintendo Switch 2 launch in June provided such
  a significant boost to sales at electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi that investors
  worried it wouldn’t be able to keep the momentum going. JB’s overall
  Australian sales rose nearly $500m annually in 2024-25, with games hardware a
  key contributor. Its profit margin was shaved down to 22% as consumers swapped
  to cheaper staple electronics while competition and promotional discounts
  ramped up. The Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier in August said the
  device’s “much-anticipated launch [and] record sales” contributed to an
  overall $550m lift in national monthly retail trade, the biggest jump since
  lockdowns lifted in late 2021. Gamers aren’t splashing out on their screens to
  match, though, with shoppers swapping high-quality TVs for cheaper
  alternatives, according to JB Hi-Fi’s chief operating officer, Nick Wells.
  “Pretty consistent with what we’ve seen, TVs in [2025] have been a bit more
  challenging, particularly average selling prices [with] people trading down,”
  he said. Black market goods Incomes may be rising but customers are still
  looking for a discount if they can find one, and online resale markets have
  fuelled a boom in shoplifting according to major retailers. Power tools at
  Bunnings, tech products at Officeworks and higher-priced Kmart products are
  being targeted for theft and resale, according to Rob Scott, chief executive
  of parent company Wesfarmers. Organised crime, rather than opportunistic petty
  theft, was responsible for the surge, Anthony Heraghty, chief executive of
  Rebel’s parent company, Super Retail group. “It is not the kid shoving a
  T-shirt in the bag, it’s someone grabbing a rack of tennis rackets and then
  selling them on a marketplace,” he said. “[They’re] coming in and taking
  thousands of dollars in one move and usually assaulting the team members on
  the way out.” The stock loss dragged profits down from the year before, even
  though Rebel cut costs and sold more goods. Streetwear retailer Universal
  Store told investors it had to set up a dedicated anti-theft manager for loss
  prevention for the first time. The black market for tobacco has also continued
  its steady rise, with most recent data indicating national nicotine
  consumption is steady even though legal sales are slumping. Tobacco sales fell
  by nearly a third in the year to June at Ampol petrol stations, contributing
  to a $30m slide in the company’s convenience store revenue for the first half
  of 2025, according to Kate Thomson, executive general manager of retail. “We
  have seen … tobacco get worse [so] certainly it’s not improving, as some may
  have hoped,” Thomson said Those who are still buying legal smokes prefer
  classier, higher-margin tobacco products, though, boosting Ampol stores’
  pre-tax profit margin to 40%, from 37% in 2024 and less than 30% in 2020.
