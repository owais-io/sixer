  The Taliban have issued an order targeting underground beauty salons operating
  in secret across Afghanistan, warning the women running them that they have
  one month to stop or face arrest. Officially, all beauty salons were closed by
  the Taliban in August 2023, shuttering 12,000 businesses with the loss of more
  than 50,000 female beautician jobs. Yet clandestine salons have continued to
  operate within communities across the country. Now, the Taliban have said that
  they intend to root out and eliminate these underground businesses, issuing
  orders to community leaders and elders across the country that they must
  identify clandestine beauty salons and report those running them to the “vice
  and virtue” police. Frestha, a 38-year-old mother of three young children,
  said she had been operating her beauty salon business in secret since they
  were banned in 2023 because she had no choice but to work and no other way of
  earning money. “When the Taliban closed our salons, I was the only breadwinner
  in my family; my husband was sick, and I had three children whose expenses I
  had to cover,” she said. “But also I kept working because I feel so good when
  I could bring beauty back to a woman. When a woman looked at herself in the
  mirror and smiled, her happiness became my happiness. “Now, I don’t think I
  can keep going because the risk is too high [but] I don’t know any other work.
  Our situation is very bad, but in this world there is no one to hear our voice
  or support us,” she added. Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in
  August 2021, women have been banned from most forms of paid employment and
  girls prevented from attending secondary school or university. Human rights
  groups say the Taliban operate a de facto system of gender apartheid,
  preventing women from engaging in any kind of public life. As well as shutting
  beauty salons, gyms and other communal spaces, women are also prevented from
  walking in public parks, travelling without a male chaperone, must cover
  themselves completely when leaving the house and are not allowed to be heard
  speaking in public.
