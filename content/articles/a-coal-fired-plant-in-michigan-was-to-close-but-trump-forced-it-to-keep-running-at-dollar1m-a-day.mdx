  Donald Trump has made several unusual moves to elongate the era of coal, such
  as giving the industry exemptions from pollution rules. But the gambit to keep
  one Michigan coal-fired power station running has been extraordinary – by
  forcing it to remain open even against the wishes of its operator. The hulking
  JH Campbell power plant, which since 1962 has sat a few hundred yards from the
  sand dunes at the edge of Lake Michigan, was just eight days away from a
  long-planned closure in May when Trump’s Department of Energy issued an
  emergency order that it remain open for a further 90 days. On Wednesday, the
  administration intervened again to extend this order even further, prolonging
  the lifetime of the coal plant another 90 days, meaning it will keep running
  until November – six months after it was due to close. The move, taken under
  emergency powers more normally used during wartime or in the wake of disaster,
  has stunned local residents and the plant’s operator, Consumers Energy. “My
  family had a countdown for it closing, we couldn’t wait,” said Mark
  Oppenhuizen, who has lived in the shadow of the plant for 30 years and
  suspects its pollution worsened his wife’s lung disease. “I was flabbergasted
  when the administration said they had stopped it shutting down,” he said. “Why
  are they inserting themselves into a decision a company has made? Just because
  politically you don’t like it? It’s all so dumb.” The 23 May order and the
  latest edict, by the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, both warn that the
  regional grid would be strained by the closure of JH Campbell with local homes
  and businesses at risk of “curtailments or outages, presenting a risk to
  public health and safety” without it. “This order will help ensure millions of
  Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload
  power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining,” Wright
  said in a statement on Thursday. But Miso, the grid operator for Michigan and
  14 other states, has stressed it has had “adequate resources to meet peak
  demand this summer” without JH Campbell and Consumers Energy had already set
  about making plans for life after its last remaining coal plant. “What’s
  remarkable is that this is the first time the energy secretary has used these
  powers without being asked to do so by the market operator or power plant
  operator,” said Timothy Fox, an energy analyst at ClearView. “It shows the
  Trump administration is prepared to take muscular actions to keep its
  preferred power sources online.” Wright – whose department has bizarrely taken
  to tweeting pictures of lumps of coal with the words “She’s an icon. She’s a
  legend” – has said the US “has got to stop closing coal plants” to help boost
  electricity generation to meet demand that is escalating due to the growth of
  artificial intelligence. The administration has also issued a separate
  emergency declaration to keep open a gas plant in Pennsylvania, although it
  has sought to kill off wind and solar projects, which Trump has called “ugly”
  and “disgusting”. The president, who solicited and received major donations
  from coal, oil and gas interests during his election campaign, has signed an
  executive order aimed at reviving what he calls “beautiful, clean coal” and
  took the remarkable step of asking fossil fuel companies to email requests to
  be exempt from pollution laws, again under emergency powers. So far, 71 coal
  plants, along with dozens of other chemical, copper smelting and other
  polluting facilities, have received “pollution passes” from the Trump
  administration according to a tally by the Environmental Defense Fund,
  allowing greater emissions of airborne toxins linked to an array of health
  problems. Coal is, despite Trump’s claims, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels
  and the leading source of planet-heating pollution. Trump has launched a
  “political takeover of the electricity grid” to favor fossil fuels, according
  to Caroline Reiser, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The
  result of this will be higher electricity bills, more pollution in our
  communities and a worsening climate crisis,” she added. In Michigan, the cost
  of keeping JH Campbell open is set to be steep. Consumers Energy initially
  estimated its closure would save ratepayers $600m by 2040 as it shifts to
  cheaper, cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind. Reversing this
  decision costs $1m a day in operating costs, an imposition that midwest
  residents will have to meet through their bills. It is understood the company
  privately told outside groups it fears the administration could keep adding
  90-day emergency orders for the entire remainder of Trump’s term. “Consumers
  Energy continues to comply with the [Department of Energy] order and will do
  so as long as it is in effect,” a company spokesperson said. “We are pursuing
  recovery of the costs of running the Campbell plant in a proceeding currently
  before [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. Timely cost recovery is
  essential.” Should the Trump administration go further and force all of the US
  fossil fuel plants set to retire by 2028 to continue operating, it will cost
  American ratepayers as much as $6bn a year in extra bills, a new report by a
  coalition of green groups has found. This would almost certainly be met by
  legal action – Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, has already filed a
  lawsuit arguing the “arbitrary and illegal order” to extend JH Campbell’s
  lifespan will unfairly heap costs upon households in the state. Trump’s
  efforts may bear some fruit, with US coal production expected to tick up
  slightly this year, although the longer-term trend for coal is one of decline
  amid cheaper gas and renewables. “The administration may slow the retirement
  trend although they are unlikely to stop it,” said ClearView’s Fox. “The
  economics don’t change but the administration could be a savior for these
  plants at least while Donald Trump is in office.” For those living next to and
  downwind of coal plants, there is a cost to be paid that isn’t just monetary.
  Tiny soot particles from burned coal can bury themselves deep into the lungs,
  causing potentially deadly respiratory and heart problems. The closure of such
  plants can lift this burden dramatically – a recent study found that in the
  month after a coal facility was closed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2016,
  the number of childhood asthma visits to local hospitals declined by 41% and
  then continued to fall by about 4% each month. The study shows “the closure of
  a major industrial pollution source can lead to immediate and lasting
  improvements in the lung health of the those who live nearby”, said Wuyue Yu,
  research co-author and postdoctoral fellow at the NYU Grossman School of
  Medicine. For those living in the township of Port Sheldon, a mostly bucolic
  setting on the shore of the vast Lake Michigan, a pollution-free future
  beckoned once JH Campbell had been scheduled to close, with lofty plans for
  new parkland, housing and a battery plant touted for the site. Now there is
  uncertainty. Last week, a few dozen residents and activists held a protest
  event next to the sprawling plant, which hummed and whirred in the summer
  heat, one 650ft chimney puncturing the horizon, another, smaller flue striped
  red and white, like a candy cane. Dozens of train cars full of coal, hastily
  procured after the plant’s supply was used up ahead of a closure that has been
  scheduled for four years, backed up in the sunshine. When burned in the huge
  1.5GW plant, this coal emits about 7.7m tons of carbon dioxide a year. “Trump
  is just trying to keep the money coming into coal companies as long as he can,
  I suppose,” said David Hoekema, who has lived a couple of miles from the plant
  since 2006 and has had to clean coal dust from his windows. Trump easily won
  this county, called Ottawa, in last year’s election, but Hoekema said even his
  staunchest conservative neighbors don’t want the coal plant. “I’ve not met
  anyone along the lake shore who says, ‘Oh yeah, let’s keep this open’ – even
  the conservative Republicans are concerned about their health,” he said.
  “Republican ideology says local control is best but the Trump administration
  is saying, ‘We don’t care what the hell states do, we will impose our order on
  them.’ I know there’s a lot of competition, but this would have to be one of
  their craziest decisions.” The Department of Energy did not respond to
  questions about its plan for JH Campbell once its latest extension expires.
  The battle over the coal plant’s future has taken place to a backdrop of a
  scorching summer in Michigan, one of its hottest on record, with algal blooms
  sprouting in its lakes, both symptoms of an unfolding climate crisis. “The
  talk in neighborhoods has been how hot it’s been this summer – my kid was
  prepared to be outside every day and it’s been so hot so often it’s been
  irresponsible to do that,” said Stephen Wooden, a Democratic state lawmaker
  who added that Michigan residents are also “pissed off” about increasing power
  bills. “We’re seeing the impacts of climate change daily, it is impacting our
  state,” Wooden said. “And this is being caused by the continuation of
  outdated, expensive fossil fuels that Donald Trump wants to prop up.”
