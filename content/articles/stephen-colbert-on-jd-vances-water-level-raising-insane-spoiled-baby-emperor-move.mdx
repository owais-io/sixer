  Late-night hosts took aim at JD Vance over his unusual birthday demand and
  Donald Trump over his disastrous tariffs. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show,
  Stephen Colbert called it “a significant day for our economy” with Trump’s
  controversial tariffs finally kicking in. He said it’s a day to “set your
  clocks back to more expensive” with import taxes now the highest they’ve been
  since the Great Depression. Colbert said it’s “never a great sign to be
  compared to the worst thing ever”. Tariffs on certain countries are lower if
  negotiations have been successful or “if the president’s mad at you they can
  be much higher”. This week saw Apple announce $100bn worth of additional
  investment in the US, but there is a smaller pool of American workers with the
  skills necessary to make an iPhone. “I believe America’s children can do
  anything!” Colbert joked. The company’s CEO, Tim Cook, was filmed this week in
  the Oval Office giving Trump a gift which was partly made of 24-carat gold.
  Colbert called it “lavish corporate bottom-smooching”. In the same press
  opportunity, Trump again slammed Colbert for having “no talent” but did
  concede that he has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon, whom he said also
  had no talent. “We’re all equally untalented,” Colbert said, before adding:
  “Thank you for watching, sir.” Colbert said that while we are “plunging
  headfirst into techno-feudalism”, the Secret Service is busy raising the water
  level of an Ohio river for Vance’s family boat trip to celebrate his birthday.
  He called it an “insane spoiled baby emperor move”. Seth Meyers On Late Night,
  Seth Meyers said that Trump “clearly has no interest in doing the job of
  president” and doesn’t “know or care what his own administration is doing on a
  daily basis”. He is too busy renovating the White House with plans revealed
  this week for a new $200m ballroom decked out in gold. Trump has said it’s
  important as there hasn’t been a president like him who has been good at
  ballrooms before. Meyers commented that it’s “never been a problem that our
  presidents weren’t good at ballrooms”. To show how little Trump knows about
  the day-to-day, he played a clip just after the US illegally bombed Iran in
  which he was told by a reporter that the intelligence community said it had no
  evidence that Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, which the president called
  false. This week when he was asked about Robert F Kennedy Jr’s decision to
  cancel $500m in contracts for vaccine development, he also appeared confused.
  “For a guy who watches cable news all day, you sure seem caught off-guard by
  the news,” Meyers said. There are also plans to put a nuclear reactor on the
  moon, a decision bragged about on Fox News with claims that “Trump doesn’t
  play by the rules”. Meyers admitted that this is true as at Nasa, rule No 1 is
  “don’t blow up the moon”. Ignoring the inflation that’s ballooning thanks in
  part to Trump’s tariffs, the administration is instead having to deal with the
  fallout of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Trump “flew into a rage again” after
  being asked about it this week. It’s still proving to be “explosive for Trump
  and his Maga base” and so this week a dinner was planned on Epstein strategy
  involving high-ranking loyalists. Nothing like a “secretive cabal” of powerful
  people to settle the conspiracy theorists, Meyers noted. It was reportedly
  planned by Vance, whom Trump threw under the bus when he was asked about it
  this week. “No matter how much you try to appease Trump or suck up to him,
  he’s eventually going to betray you,” he said.
