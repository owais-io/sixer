  I travel for food. It’s usually the first reason I’d want to go to a
  destination – maybe I’ve seen a dish, some cuisine or produce that I’m
  intrigued by. It inspires me to research the place and build up an itinerary
  based on what I want to eat. For example, I’ve got some family in Hong Kong,
  so I often go on trips there. I love wonton noodles and I’ll plan a whole day
  around trying different noodles all across Hong Kong. What to eat is
  everything. My background is Cantonese and I’ve always interpreted love and
  the reason for living through my stomach. I grew up in a Chinese takeaway in a
  tiny village on the south coast of England. My parents worked super long
  hours, six days a week. On their day off, they always made sure that we had a
  family meal out to try different cuisines. My curiosity comes from learning
  about food with them at an early age, being inquisitive about different
  cultures. I’m so grateful to them for that. My parents aren’t the type to ever
  verbally express love, so that was their way of making sure we knew we were
  loved and felt taken care of. Everyone can communicate through cooking – there
  might be common ingredients or techniques that connect us and transcend
  language barriers. Food is a beautiful way of being able to travel from the
  comfort of your home. Travel is such a privilege and one not everybody has.
  Being introduced to different flavours and seasonings helps you feel
  transported to a place without having to physically be there. When I find
  myself in between holidays, my groceries become my travel plans. I add
  slow-roasted peppers or ‘nduja to take me to southern Europe. Or maybe some
  chimichurri if I want to pop over to Argentina. It’s a way to introduce your
  taste buds to the flavour palette of that cuisine or region, using bits you
  can find on Ocado. If I’m feeling particularly adventurous (or ravenous) I
  might combine regions, and travel the world in one sitting. An
  around-the-world tapas, if you will. Ocado has a huge variety of globally
  inspired products so it’s my go-to shopping destination when I fancy a
  culinary adventure. It really is a dream travel buddy. The barbecue culture of
  Japan and Korea I went on a girls’ trip to Okinawa in Japan with my mum and my
  two sisters a year and a half ago. I had some of the best-tasting vegetables
  I’ve ever eaten. Okinawan food culture is similar to Cantonese – very minimal
  seasoning. Every dish was delightfully light but also so full of flavour, and
  that goes for their barbecued and grilled food too, which I love. The meat is
  just so fresh and they pair really beautiful fruits with meat. Like taking
  bitter gourd, a really bitter kind of melon, and then combining it with fatty
  slices of pork belly seared on the barbecue. Delicious! There’s a massive
  barbecue culture in both Japan and Korea. The focus is on the quality of the
  beef and pork. Take Japanese wagyu – the fat and marbling gives it a unique,
  tender texture and flavour. Over in Korea, you have incredible marinades,
  which can be a lot sweeter and stickier than what we might typically have at
  British barbecues. For my holiday at home tapas, I would use spicy Korean
  chilli paste (gochujang) to marinate skewers of pork belly with cherry
  tomatoes and courgette. I use such a wide range of ingredients that gathering
  what I need for recipes can be time consuming, but with the range at Ocado I
  can pretty much find anything I need and add it alongside all my usual
  groceries. As you can tell, when I’m taking a culinary adventure to either
  Japan or Korea, I very much have a grilling on my mind … M&amp;S Collection

  CJ Taeyangcho red pepper gochujang paste The ethos of the mediterranean
  Another of my favourite countries for food memories is Greece. I just got back
  from an island-hopping holiday where I got engaged (in Santorini!) so it’s a
  very special place for me. A lot of my love for Mediterranean and southern
  European food is in the sun-soaked ingredients, like olive oil and olives,
  that are so integral to the cuisines of the various cultures. Think sweet,
  slow-roasted tomatoes with a glass of sparkling wine or a local crisp white
  wine with seafood. In southern Europe and the Med, you have time to properly
  relax over sundowner drinks and small, snacky plates of whatever’s fresh that
  day. You can feel the attitude towards life in how they enjoy the food and
  drink. I’m reminded of Mallorca, Malta, Lisbon, Faro: all places where it’s
  about enjoying a slower pace of life … M&amp;S olive &amp; antipasti sharing
  platter M&amp;S semi-dried tomatoes &amp; Italian mozzarella Daylesford
  Chateau Leoube sparkling Provence rosé The spice of South Africa Whenever I
  speak to any of my friends who have been to South Africa, they always talk
  about three things: safari, the quality of the meats and the quality of the
  wines. The way peri peri, the spicy chilli sauce, is incorporated into South
  African cuisine is fascinating – the flavours are used generously across South
  African grills and barbecues. I researched the history behind the sauce and
  discovered that peri peri has travelled the world. There’s inspiration from
  Angola and Mozambique – those spices and bold flavours. Here in the UK, peri
  peri is associated with a cheeky Nando’s. Sometimes we can take a dish for
  granted and we don’t think about the journey it’s made across centuries to
  land on our plate. But when you learn about it, it’s fascinating. I pair peri
  peri sauce with the cool creaminess of Ocado’s onion and garlic dip – try
  slathering on a burger bun, you won’t be disappointed … Ocado onion &amp;
  garlic dip Ocado large seeded burger buns Ocado peri peri chicken grills The
  zing of Latin America Whenever I think of Latin America, I think of the
  vibrancy, the bold flavours – fresh, spicy and steamy. All of the countries
  are so different from one another, but they share a focus on fresh flavours.
  They create the most incredible marinades and seasonings using chilli peppers
  and limes to make it citrusy and bright. It’s a region I would love to see
  more of – to go to Argentina and Brazil and try all the meats and chimichurri.
  In Mexico I embarrassed myself – I thought that you simply downed a tequila
  shot. But I was humbled and learned that’s just what Brits do. You’re actually
  meant to savour it and sip it. When I want to bring the Latin American vibe to
  my kitchen, Ocado has everything I need, from tequila to tortilla chips. I
  thought of making an elderflower margarita as a nice way of combining the
  flavours of Britain and Mexico … Casamigos Reposado tequila St Germain French
  elderflower liqueur Chimilove mild chimichurri Gran Luchito lightly salted
  tortilla chips M&amp;S Grill 4 king prawn skewers with nduja marinade Life
