  Hot off a gig where she was selling a bar of “morning wood” soap containing
  her used bathwater, the actor Sydney Sweeney is making headlines for another
  dubious advert. This one is for American Eagle and the campaign line idea is
  that Sweeney, clad in denim, has great jeans. Get it? An apparel company
  employing a zeitgeisty actor and exploiting an obvious genes/jeans pun to flog
  denim would not normally be noteworthy. But the ad has sparked an intense
  online discussion, one which has now bubbled up to the White House, about
  whether having a blond-haired, blue-eyed actor – who happens to keep pretty
  quiet about politics – talking about her great genes is a racist dog-whistle
  and nod to eugenics. The supporting evidence for this is a campaign video
  (which appears to have been removed after backlash) in which Sweeney, looking
  at the camera suggestively, says: “My body’s composition is determined by my
  genes.” There’s then a little joke about the cameraperson looking at her
  breasts before she continues: “Genes are passed down from parents to
  offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye
  color … My jeans are blue.” In a TikTok reaction video with almost 300,000
  likes, one influencer accuses the Euphoria actor of ignoring the current
  political climate. “It’s literally giving, I don’t know if I should say this,
  Nazi propaganda,” the TikToker proclaimed. (Probably shouldn’t have said that,
  to be honest.) She also asked, exasperated: “Why do you need to sexualize
  jeans so much?” Oh, my sweet summer child, have you never seen an advert
  before? Sex supposedly sells (although studies refute this piece of
  advertising wisdom) and even toothpaste will get sexualized. The pockets of
  liberal outrage over the Sweeney ad have been a godsend to Fox News, which has
  covered the backlash to the ad campaign 28 times more than it covered the
  Epstein controversy this week. Even White House staffers have spoken out about
  this extremely important issue. “Cancel culture run amok,” the White House
  communications manager, Steven Cheung, wrote of the ad on X. “This warped,
  moronic and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way
  they did in 2024 ...” The conservative TV personality Megyn Kelly also decried
  the “lunatic left” getting upset about nothing. You wait your whole life for
  an advert with a weird fixation on genetics to come out and then, what do you
  know, two come along at once. Instead of the American Eagle controversy
  fizzling out after a couple of days of online outrage, the story took on new
  dimensions this week after people noticed that a new Dunkin’ ad for its Golden
  Hour refresher (some kind of alarmingly yellow beverage) also mentions
  genetics. “This tan? Genetics,” actor Gavin Casalegno, says in the ad. “I just
  got my color analysis back. Guess what? Golden summer, literally!” More like
  Angry Influencer summer, literally! “Why are ads so obsessed with genetics all
  of a sudden?” one TikTok user commented on Dunkin’s post. Another asked:
  “Genuinely, what does a drink have to do with genetics?” (Again, have none of
  these people ever seen an advert before? Chocolate has nothing to do with
  gorillas, and the Cadbury’s “drumming gorilla” ad is one of the greatest
  pieces of marketing of all time.) It is established wisdom that you need at
  least three examples to call something a “trend”. Unless a toothpaste advert
  featuring bright white teeth (the result of my superior genetics!) drops while
  I write this, we’re currently at “weird coincidence” rather than full-blown
  conspiracy. But this isn’t to say that we should dismiss all the buzz as a
  load of influencers getting angry about nothing. Adverts hold a mirror up to
  society and the repeated reference to genetics does say something about the
  current moment. Perhaps what it screams the loudest is that brands are no
  longer concerned about trying to look progressive. For just under a decade
  (ending around 2022) we were very much in the era of woke-vertising, where
  brands were busy trying to co-opt feminism and activist culture. There was,
  for example, that famous Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad in 2017 in which Jenner
  creates world peace by giving a police officer at a protest a Pepsi. In the
  same year a financial firm installed a “‘Fearless Girl’” statue by the famous
  Charging Bull in Wall Street, to make a point about how investment banking is
  empowering, actually. And even Victoria’s Secret got a “feminist” rebrand in
  2017. Ad agencies also spent a lot of time pulling together panels about how
  important diversity is. (I worked in advertising for a long time and was on a
  lot of those panels.) Now that Trump has declared war on DEI, a lot of
  companies have gleefully done away with pretending to care about diversity or
  feminism. While I don’t think the American Eagle and Dunkin’ ads are in any
  way a nod to eugenics, I’m also not sure that they would have come out in
  2020, when the George Floyd protests meant racism was a national conversation.
  There would probably have been a lot more sensitivity to how references to
  genetics might get perceived. The repeated reference to genes also reflects
  the way in which certain eugenicist views have started to move from the racist
  fringes into mainstream culture. Elon Musk has repeatedly said he wants smart
  people to have more kids, for example; a common refrain in pro-natalist
  circles. Meanwhile Simone and Malcolm Collins, who have been dubbed “hipster
  eugenicists”, have generated a million headlines for their quest to have an
  army of genetically optimized children via IVF. Meanwhile more startups are
  popping up that promise to screen IVF-created embryos for “desirable” traits.
  One service has suggested that people who use their service might end up with
  a child who is, on average, six IQ points smarter than the child they would
  have had through natural conception. American Eagle may not be selling
  eugenics to the masses quite yet, but we are certainly entering an era of
  designer genes.
