  The Indonesian government is working on plans to treat 2,000 people from
  war-ravaged Gaza, holding a series of inter-ministerial discussions to discuss
  logistics, legality and foreign policy implications relating to the highly
  sensitive proposal, according to a senior government official. Indonesia
  announced earlier this month that it would provide temporary medical
  assistance to 2,000 Palestinians from Gaza, with the uninhabited island of
  Galang identified as one possible site. Located just south of Singapore, the
  island was once home to a former camp for Vietnamese refugees and most
  recently the site of a pandemic hospital. In Muslim-majority Indonesia, a
  nation that has no formal diplomatic relations with Israel, and has long been
  a staunch supporter of Palestinian statehood, government officials have been
  reluctant to provide any details, saying it is just one option being
  considered. But reflecting a level of seriousness about the proposal, various
  ministries, including the coordinating security ministry and the ministries of
  health and foreign affairs have met to discuss how it would be implemented,
  said Dave Lakono, deputy chair of the parliament’s commission I, which
  oversees defence and foreign affairs. “These discussions have focused on
  logistical feasibility, medical readiness, and legal frameworks,” Laksono told
  the Guardian, “Commission I has also been briefed on the strategic
  implications, particularly regarding Indonesia’s foreign policy posture and
  regional stability.” Plans at this stage remain “exploratory”, he said, with
  Galang island identified as one site due its historical use for humanitarian
  purposes and existing infrastructure. Other sites, including facilities in
  West Java and Central Java that have proximity to major hospitals and
  logistical hubs are also being considered, he said. The Indonesian government
  appears to be considering several possibilities, with the use of large
  military hospitals in Jakarta, and also a site in Jordan, a country with which
  Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subinatio has particularly strong relations,
  also raised during ministerial discussions, according to one senior official
  with direct knowledge of the talks. Officials acknowledge the plan will be
  politically delicate, with some national Islamic leaders accusing the
  government of being “deceived” by Israel, and questioning what guarantees
  would be in place to ensure their return. “One of the issues is how to make
  sure the right to return of the Palestinians can be respected because we know
  that many are worried that this kind of policy can be interpreted in other
  ways,” said Abdul Kadir Jailani, the director general for Asian, Pacific and
  African affairs at Indonesia’s ministry of foreign affairs, stressing that no
  final decision had been made on Galang. “So we have to make sure it will be
  consistent with the principle of international humanitarian law, and in
  particular how to respect the right to return of the Palestinians.” “One of
  the most important things is that we are not going to do that without approval
  and support from relevant stakeholders, in particular Palestinian authorities
  and countries in the region,” he added, “The implementation of this plan has a
  high level of complexity, particularly in terms of its political and technical
  aspects.” Indonesia was able to conduct its second humanitarian airdrop on
  Gaza in two days this week, a move Jailani said was facilitated with support
  and coordination from neighbouring Jordan. Axios reported this July that
  Israel’s spy agency The Mossad had visited Washington to seek US support in
  convincing countries to take hundreds of thousand of Palestinians from Gaza,
  with Indonesia among several countries reportedly receptive to the idea. Any
  permanent relocation would be hugely controversial in Indonesia, but so far,
  criticism of the Gaza plan has been relatively muted in the south-east Asian
  country. “At the moment there are so many issues in the headlines so the Gaza
  issue to be honest is not that widely reported in the media,” said political
  analyst Kennedy Muslim. “It’s not a major issue in Indonesia at the moment.”
  Parliament member Laksono stressed that any measures to accept Palestinians
  from Gaza would be temporary, with coordination with agencies such as Unrwa
  and ICRC to establish clear documentation, medical records, and repatriation
  protocols. “Our objective is to provide care, not resettlement, and to support
  their eventual return once conditions in Gaza allow,” he said. “This is a
  delicate undertaking, and we are fully aware of the geopolitical sensitivities
  involved.”
