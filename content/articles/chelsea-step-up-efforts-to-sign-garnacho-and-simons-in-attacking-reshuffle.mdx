  Chelsea are to step up attempts to sign Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester
  United and Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig and could sell Nicolas Jackson, as they
  continue to reshape their attacking options. The club have brought in Liam
  Delap, João Pedro and Jamie Gittens, and moves for Garnacho and Simons are
  understood to be their priority. Garnacho has played no part in United’s
  pre-season and is thought to be available for about £50m, although Chelsea are
  understood to be reluctant to pay that. The Argentina forward is believed to
  be keen to move to Stamford Bridge after Ruben Amorim made clear the
  21-year-old is not part of his plans at Old Trafford. Chelsea have yet to make
  an official approach but are likely to do so, with United seeking to balance
  their books as they close on the signing of Benjamin Sesko from Leipzig.
  Chelsea are in talks with the German club over Simons, who is understood to
  have agreed personal terms despite interest from Bayern Munich. The
  22-year-old, who can play in several attacking roles, joined Leipzig from
  Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m after two successful loan spells. He
  is expected to cost about €70m (£61m) and Leipzig are targeting Liverpool’s
  Harvey Elliott as a potential replacement. Jackson is understood to prefer to
  stay at Chelsea despite the arrivals of Delap and Pedro dropping him down the
  pecking order, but Chelsea are believed to be willing to sell the Senegal
  striker for the right price. Newcastle could be an option if, as expected,
  they miss out on Sesko, and Jackson also has interest from Milan and other
  Italian clubs but Chelsea could demand £80m. Chelsea’s 19-year-old Spanish
  striker Marc Guiu is poised to join Sunderland on loan having completed his
  medical on Wednesday, and Everton have completed the £28m signing of the
  midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury‑Hall on a five-year contract. Burnley are closing
  in on signing Armando Broja for £20m and are likely to pay a similar fee for
  Lesley Ugochukwu. Borussia Dortmund are also in talks with Chelsea over a
  permanent deal for Carney Chukwuemeka, who spent part of last season on loan
  in Germany. Chelsea have sold Kepa Arrizabalaga, Noni Madueke, Djordje
  Petrovic and João Félix for combined fees that could reach well above £100m.
  They are also hoping to offload Raheem Sterling, who spent last season on loan
  at Arsenal and has been linked with clubs in Turkey, together with Axel
  Disasi, Renato Veiga, Christopher Nkunku and Ben Chilwell. The Netherlands
  defender Jorrel Hato became Chelsea’s latest summer signing when his £37m move
  from Ajax was confirmed on Sunday.
