  Anthony Albanese has criticised calls for further actions against Israel as
  “slogans” as he faces intensifying pressure from his own MPs, Labor members
  and the Greens to reconsider his position on the war and humanitarian crisis
  in Gaza. It comes as the Zionist Federation of Australia, a national Jewish
  organisation, revealed it is “deeply troubled” by the scenes in Gaza and has
  urged Israel to ensure sufficient aid flows to Palestinian civilians “without
  delay”. Ed Husic, Albanese’s former science minister and now a backbench Labor
  MP, has also urged Australia to immediately join the UK and France in
  preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood, describing it as a tide of
  “moral momentum”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email On Wednesday, Australia
  joined 14 other countries to describe the recognition of Palestine as “an
  essential step towards the two-state solution”, linking progress on statehood
  to the upcoming United Nations general assembly meeting in September. The
  prime minister will hold more talks with his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer, in
  coming days, but stopped short of matching Starmer’s promise to recognise the
  state of Palestine in September unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and
  commits to a two-state solution. “What I’ve said is that it’s not the
  timeline, that’s not what we’re looking at. What we’re looking at is the
  circumstances where recognition will advance the objective of the creation of
  two states,” Albanese said at Parliament House. “I’ve said for a long time, my
  entire political life, I’ve said I support two states … that’s my objective.
  Not making a statement, not giving a political point, but achieving peace.”
  Husic, an increasingly outspoken member of the Labor caucus, said recognising
  statehood would deprive terror group Hamas of its power over Gaza and
  ultimately speed up the peace process and the flow of urgently needed
  humanitarian aid. “Hamas is built largely on grievance,” Husic said in the
  hours after Starmer’s announcement on Wednesday. “That grievance gets removed
  with the establishment of a state of Palestine, nurtured with the cooperation
  and support of the international community, progressed through the development
  of democratic institutions.” The opposition finance spokesperson, James
  Paterson, said the opposition still maintained Palestinian recognition should
  only occur at the end of a peace process, adding it would otherwise be
  “extremely counterproductive”. “Premature recognition of a Palestinian state
  before Hamas has been dismantled, before the Palestinian Authority recognises
  Israel’s right to exist, before they give up their aims of using terrorism to
  abolish the Israeli state, I think, would be extremely counterproductive,” he
  told ABC radio. Albanese this week accused Israel of a breach of international
  law in blocking aid into Gaza, saying “you can’t hold innocent people
  responsible” for the actions of Hamas, and warning that Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  government is “losing support” internationally. But he dismissed calls for
  further sanctions against the Netanyahu government as “slogans” compared with
  the federal government’s action so far. In May, Australia joined with the UK,
  Canada, New Zealand and Norway in placing financial sanctions and travel bans
  on two Israeli government ministers for “inciting violence against
  Palestinians in the West Bank”. “What we are about is meaningful action, not
  slogans,” Albanese said in Canberra on Wednesday. “We have, I think, taken
  appropriate action and it’s been, as I say, sanctioning ministers in a
  democratic government. If you can point to a comparison where that’s occurred,
  I’d be happy to hear it.” The Zionist Federation of Australia said it is the
  “collective moral obligation” of Israel and the United Nations to address the
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza in a statement contrasting with reported denials
  of starvation by the Israeli embassy in Australia. The group’s president,
  Jeremy Leibler, said “our humanity also compels us to recognise the pain and
  suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza. We are deeply troubled by
  the reports of hunger in parts of Gaza.” The comments followed the sanctioning
  of Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi last week in the Senate after she held up a
  protest sign against Israel during the governor general’s address. The Greens
  moved a motion on Wednesday afternoon, supported by Labor, describing Israel’s
  blockade as illegal and at risk of causing “mass death from starvation”.
  Senator David Shoebridge said Albanese’s criticisms that alternative
  approaches were just “slogans” was “deeply insulting”, adding sanctions
  against the Israeli government were necessary actions. “As the prime minister
  himself acknowledged today, empty slogans without action will not feed
  starving children in Gaza,” Shoebridge said. Support from within Labor’s
  rank-and-file for sanctions and Palestinian statehood continues to grow. The
  Victorian Labor state conference will debate a motion from rank-and-file
  members on the weekend urging further sanctions on Israel and the recognition
  of the state of Palestine. Similarly-worded motions circulated by the Labor
  Friends of Palestine have also passed in more than 80 local Labor branches in
  recent weeks. On Tuesday, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, avoided
  criticising Israel. Asked directly if people in Gaza are facing starvation,
  Ley repeatedly said only that it was a “complex situation”.
