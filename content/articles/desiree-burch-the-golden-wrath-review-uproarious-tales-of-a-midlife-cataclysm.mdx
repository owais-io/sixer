  Desiree Burch: The Golden Wrath review – uproarious tales of a midlife
  cataclysm
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  Desiree Burch is 46. For most comedians, this is the time to deliver your
  mildly grumpy show about middle age: the bodily decay; the annoying habits of
  the generation coming up behind you. That all features in The Golden Wrath,
  but it’s ratcheted up to the nth degree. For Burch, middle age isn’t a mild
  development, it’s a cataclysm. The perimenopause apparently has 66 separate
  symptoms, and Burch’s mind and body are weathering not a slow decline but an
  all-out attack. All-out attack is Burch’s performance style too, in a show
  that hurls at us her experience of hormonal female midlife. It’s a blast –
  because our host is a charismatic, bombastic stage presence, and because she
  textures the comedy of ageing with moral indignation alongside the physical
  indignity. Burch sets the scene by placing herself generationally, holding up
  her own gen X experience (“we walked so you could run”) against those of the
  boomers, millennials and gen Z’s in the room. This isn’t always novel (“Do you
  guys remember the rotary phone?”), but it’s playful and relatable, skilfully
  softening us up for the onslaught to come. Suffice to say, hers is not a
  perspective on the perimenopause that will have anyone looking forward to
  their 40s. She talks about the joints that suddenly stop working, the
  infuriating sleeplessness, and there’s a loud, lurid routine about “juicy
  pussies” v vaginal dryness. All those endless symptoms are itemised in a spoof
  advert for this grim life-stage, which Burch warns can last a decade. Arguably
  the show overplays its hand, making little allowance for other, milder
  experiences of female midlife, and overstating the degree to which menopause
  narratives are unheard. A strand protesting about gender inequalities in
  medicine, with reference to a connection between menopausal “brain fog” and
  her mother’s dementia, feels underdeveloped. A subplot about her mum’s
  marriage and Burch’s childlessness are imperfectly integrated. But Burch’s
  extreme take on hormonal change remains uproarious, and is supplemented with
  strong standalone sections on her aversion to brushing her teeth and the
  contents of women’s handbags (AKA “a miniature bodega in every Louis
  Vuitton”). The change may be brewing for our host – but her standup skills are
  undimmed. • At Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 10 August. Then touring from 3
  October. • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
