  The UK exchequer is chasing about £90m in unpaid taxes after a temporary
  staffing business was rescued from insolvency proceedings in an £18m deal that
  reimbursed private funders in full. The main assets of Challenge Recruitment
  Group, which counted Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Co-op among its top customers,
  were acquired from administration in July by the US website swipejobs, in what
  appears to be the second time the British staffing business has emerged from
  insolvency while owing tens of millions of pounds to the exchequer. The levels
  of debt owed by Challenge to HM Revenue and Customs has emerged as the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is under pressure to announce tax rises in her
  autumn budget in order to shore up the public finances. Swipejobs paid £4.9m
  as part of a “pre-pack” administration deal for the pick of Challenge’s
  contracts supplying staff to a series of huge UK brands, as well as £12.7m to
  the collapsed group’s secured lenders, Close Brothers and Praetura Asset
  Finance, according to a report by administrators FRP. A pre-pack
  administration is a restructuring deal agreed in advance of a company entering
  insolvency – a staged process that frees the acquired business of debt and
  leaves administrators to use receipts to at least partly pay creditors.
  Challenge’s remaining creditors, including HMRC, will probably be repaid a
  fraction of what they are owed. When the deal to acquire Challenge assets from
  administration was announced on 12 July, a statement by the UK group made no
  mention of the company’s difficulties. It said: “We’re proud to announce that
  Challenge-trg Group has been acquired by swipejobs … Together, we are in an
  even better position to deliver exceptional results and enhanced operational
  efficiency; all underpinned by market-leading technology.” Four Challenge
  businesses in administration owe HMRC about £34m, according to the
  administrator’s report. A fifth company, TLR White Trading, owes a further
  £56m to HMRC relating to “five months of VAT and four months of PAYE” incurred
  by the wider Challenge business. TLR White Trading entered a separate
  insolvency process in April 2025, six months after being spun out of the
  Challenge Recruitment Group in October 2024. The new standalone company had
  the sole function of providing “temporary staffing and payroll services” to
  the wider Challenge group and was funded by the larger business in order to
  settle its “payroll costs”. The latest Challenge insolvency comes after the
  same recruitment business, then called IF Trade Co, transferred its main
  contracts to Challenge-trg in 2022, before entering administration with debts
  to HMRC of about £34m, according to further documents filed with Companies
  House. Two brothers, Richard and Thomas Cropper, were directors of both IF
  Trade and Challenge-trg. The siblings then sold a 75% stake in Challenge to an
  employee ownership trust for an undisclosed sum in October 2024, nine months
  before the group companies entered administration. Swipejobs said it had
  acquired Challenge assets on a “go-forward basis” and that the brothers have
  been given a six-month consultancy contract. The Croppers did not respond to
  efforts to contact them. HMRC estimates that “phoenixism” – the art of
  liquidating a company and allowing the directors to rise from the ashes in a
  new entity, free of debts – cost the exchequer about 22% of the £3.8bn of tax
  losses reported in 2022 to 2023. An HMRC spokesperson said: “As the chancellor
  announced in her spring statement, the government is taking action to improve
  collaboration between HMRC, Companies House and the Insolvency Service to
  tackle those using contrived corporate insolvencies and dissolutions –
  so-called ‘phoenixism’ – to evade tax.”
