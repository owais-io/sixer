  When the UK government announced the creation of the Alan Turing Institute in
  2014 it promised a “fitting memorial” to the renowned computer scientist and
  artificial intelligence pioneer. More than a decade on, Britain’s leading AI
  institute is in turmoil as staff warn it may be in danger of collapse and
  ministers demand a shift in focus to defence and security work. “The ATI brand
  is well recognised internationally,” says Dame Wendy Hall, a professor of
  computer science at the University of Southampton and the co-chair of a 2017
  government AI review. “If it ceases to be the national institute for AI and
  data science then we are at risk of weakening our international leadership in
  AI.” Turing’s legacy, as the mathematical genius who helped crack the Enigma
  code, outlined key concepts of AI and invented the eponymous test to discern
  whether a computer can show human intelligence, has been rebuilt and burnished
  in recent years. In 2013 he received a posthumous royal pardon 59 years after
  his death, having been convicted of gross indecency in 1952 after admitting a
  sexual relationship with a man. A year later he was immortalised in the
  Oscar-winning film The Imitation Game and in 2021 he became the face of the
  £50 note. A cornerstone of that legacy is in trouble, however. This month a
  group of staff filed a whistleblower complaint with the Charity Commission,
  which has a regulatory role over ATI because the nominally independent
  organisation is a registered charity – albeit largely funded by the UK
  government. The complaint raised eight points of concern including the
  possibility that £100m of government funding might be withdrawn, which “could
  lead to the Institute’s collapse”. “These concerns are so significant that
  many staff now believe the institute’s charitable status and public
  credibility are at risk,” said the complaint, which also raised concerns about
  internal governance and culture as well as oversight of spending. It is the
  latest in a series of staff broadsides at management. In March last year more
  than 180 staff wrote a letter to leadership expressing “serious concerns”
  about the organisation’s approach to diversity after it appointed four men to
  senior roles. In December more than 90 staff warned in another letter that
  ATI’s credibility was in “serious jeopardy” amid a restructuring that was
  threatening jobs – and research projects. ATI has recently notified about 50
  staff – or approximately 10% of its workforce – that they are at risk of
  redundancy and is shutting down projects related to online safety, tackling
  the housing crisis and reducing health inequality. This is part of an overhaul
  dubbed Turing 2.0 under which the institute will focus on three key areas:
  health, the environment, and defence and security. A recent letter from the UK
  technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has made clear the overhaul does not go far
  enough. Writing to ATI’s chair last month, Kyle demanded the institute switch
  its main focus to defence and security, adding that ATI’s “longer-term funding
  arrangement” could be reviewed next year. “Moving forward, defence and
  national security projects should form a core of ATI’s activities, and
  relationships with the UK’s security, defence, and intelligence communities
  should be strengthened accordingly,” Kyle wrote. He also indicated that
  leadership changes might be needed. “To realise this vision, it is imperative
  that the ATI’s leadership reflects the institute’s reformed focus,” he wrote.
  “Careful consideration should be given to the importance of an executive team
  who possesses a relevant background and sector knowledge to lead this
  transition.” It is against this backdrop – long-running staff dissatisfaction
  with leadership, a strategic and financial overhaul, and then a bombshell from
  the government – that the whistleblower complaint was filed. ATI is led by
  chief executive Jean Innes, who has had senior roles in the civil service and
  tech sector, and is chaired by Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon’s UK
  operations and interim chair of the UK’s competition watchdog. Gurr responded
  to Kyle last month with a letter pledging to “step up” on defence and national
  security as well as boosting the UK’s self-sufficiency in AI – or “sovereign
  capabilities”. “We will step up at a time of national need,” Gurr wrote.
  However, Gurr added that ATI will “continue to drive forward high-impact work
  in environment and healthcare” where it fits with the “government’s missions
  and the interests of our philanthropic and private funders”. At a recent
  meeting between staff and ATI leadership, held remotely, Gurr faced pointed
  questions about the new direction raised by Kyle and the institute’s
  restructuring. One attender said the atmosphere was difficult, describing the
  mood among the more than 100 employees during the meeting as “contemptuous
  throughout”. In an internal note to staff this week, Innes and Gurr confirmed
  a new working group of government officials and ATI staff had met to discuss
  the new direction. It also confirmed people would be leaving through
  redundancies and non-renewal of contracts. ATI’s goals include to “advance
  world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well
  as driving an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding UK
  universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, UCL and Warwick, with its
  research work including teaming up with the Met Office to improve weather
  forecasting, creating cardiac “digital twins” to study heart disease and
  improving air traffic control. A source who worked in the previous
  Conservative government said Labour’s concerns about the institute are “far
  from new” and there had been disquiet in political circles about the
  institute’s performance for some time, with multiple university stakeholders
  blurring its focus. In that context, the source said, it makes sense to double
  down on what the institute does well – defence and security – or “just shut it
  down and start again”. Prof Jon Crowcroft, the Marconi professor of
  communication systems at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Lab, and an
  adviser to Innes, says the institute’s staff have become unsettled. “I think
  the crisis in terms of people is real. A lot of people are still there because
  they believe it’s a good, open institution doing valuable public work. But
  they’re also wondering where their job is going to be,” he says. He adds: “I
  have not seen a plan A for keeping all the staff happy, which would mean
  keeping some non-defence and security projects. The reason why staff have
  issued these letters is because they have not seen that.” Referring to ATI’s
  base at the British Library in London, he says: “Nor have I seen a plan B for
  what happens if too many people leave, because so many projects have gone,
  which means the core funding is not viable and they cannot justify the size of
  the building they are in.” There are “mixed views” on the looming shift to
  defence and security, according to a current staff member who says they have
  listened to a “diverse” array of concerns among colleagues. “We understand the
  national importance issue. Very few of us are saying that work shouldn’t
  happen. But we think a singular focus would be too narrow. Turing’s strength
  comes from applying AI to a wide range of societal challenges, from health to
  the environment, with responsible innovation at the heart.” The staff member
  adds: “Those areas are still important, and with the right leadership we could
  fulfil the vision and purpose that brought us here in the first place.” The
  staff member adds that Gurr’s letter pledging to double down on defence and
  security, while still working on health and environment, leaves ATI in a
  “precarious standoff” with government. “The leadership is hoping the
  government’s attention, or its personnel, shifts,” they said. Hall says the
  institute has no choice but to change. “Clearly there is not much money around
  and the institute needs to do what the government asks. If it doesn’t, then
  presumably the government will close it down.” She adds: “The institute has
  ceased to be what it was initially set up to be, which was a national
  institute for data science and AI. The government has asked it to focus on
  defence and security. Whether the UK needs such an institute is for the
  government to decide. Personally I would like to see the justification.”
  Crowcroft, who defends the quality of the institute’s work, says the UK has
  always been strong in AI and is “probably now stronger still”, pointing to
  multiple generations of AI expertise produced by universities such as
  Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College and Edinburgh as well as the success of
  London-based Google DeepMind and the establishment of UK-based AI units by
  leading US tech firms such as Microsoft and OpenAI. A spokesperson for ATI
  said the institute was going through “substantial” change to continue to
  deliver in its unique role as the UK’s national institute for data science and
  AI. “As we move forward, we’re focused on delivering real-world impact across
  society’s biggest challenges, including responding to the national need to
  double down on our work in defence, national security and sovereign
  capabilities.” A government spokesperson said the technology secretary wants
  ATI to show value for money for taxpayer, which can be achieved by “giving the
  institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it
  where the British public expects it to be”. Turing’s legacy will live on. But
  in terms of the institute that bears his name, its longevity is in doubt.
