  In 2024, the suspected Porepunkah gunman Dezi Freeman told the Victorian
  supreme court his firearm licence had been taken. “I had my firearms licences
  cancelled and lost my club membership,” Freeman wrote in a submission. In the
  hearing, he sought to challenge the cancellation of his driver’s licence.
  Freeman, who has described himself as a photographer and “homeless disability
  pensioner”, was disqualified from driving for two years after refusing to
  submit to a drug test and for using a mobile phone while driving. He described
  the serious hardship caused to himself and his family by the loss of his
  driver’s licence, and claimed there had been “years of homelessness and being
  constantly attacked by police”. “The stress, hardships, injustice, misery and
  poverty exacerbated by not being able to drive affects us all,” Freeman wrote.
  His application for judicial review was dismissed. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Freeman has a history of run-ins with law enforcement and has shared in
  the past some forms of pseudo-legal beliefs, where adherents make arguments
  that deny the authority of the state. Police confirmed on Friday that
  Freeman’s gun licence remained revoked at the time he allegedly killed two
  officers and injured another at his high country property on Tuesday.
  Pseudo-legal beliefs grounds for cancellation As part of its investigation
  into gun control, Guardian Australia has found pseudo-legal ideas are an issue
  in firearm disputes across the country, with police in some cases citing
  “sovereign citizen” beliefs as grounds to cancel licences and remove weapons.
  Freeman’s disdain for authority appears to be extreme, but at the other end of
  the spectrum, police have raised concerns about the use of sovereign citizen
  arguments for several years. One Queensland man’s firearm licence was
  cancelled after police received correspondence indicating he held “sovereign
  citizen beliefs”, including that “the laws in force in Queensland” did not
  apply to him. The man had attempted to arrest a policeman and filed
  “voluminous” material appealing against his licence revocation, including
  claims that a certificate of birth registration was designed “to fraudulently
  turn a child into property of the Reserve Bank”. In another Queensland case, a
  woman caught speeding used language in a letter to police that “indicated she
  held sovereign citizen ideologies”, according to court documents. “She
  effectively asserted that the Queensland police had no authority to fine her
  for speeding, and that she was not the named person on the infringement notice
  but rather her ‘strawman’ name was what appeared thereon.” A “strawman” name
  is what some adherents to pseudo-law believe is created when their name is
  written in all capital letters on a birth certificate. They claim this
  identity is separate legally from their actual identity, and they use this
  argument to reject the authority of governments and courts. Police then took
  the step of cancelling her firearm licence, but she successfully overturned
  the decision, admitting that her use of these arguments was misguided and
  wrong. In another matter, Queensland police cancelled a man’s firearm licence
  on suspicion he was “an adherent to pseudo-law beliefs”, however the tribunal
  found there was no evidence he’d held such beliefs and found he was a fit and
  proper person. It’s unclear how often pseudo-legal beliefs play a role in
  licence revocations across all states and territories, as police forces do not
  routinely report reasons for firearm licence cancellation. ‘You’re on
  sovereign ground’ In other cases, adherents to pseudo-legal ideologies have
  been able to arm themselves without a licence. In early November 2022, police
  approached a property in Binnaway in NSW intending to arrest the resident in
  relation to an intimidation charge. On arrival, police found a house
  signposted with a “sovereign land” plaque. The offender told police that he
  would not leave his home. “You’re on sovereign ground, you will be neutralised
  if you fucking hurt me, or try and do anything to me,” he said. After a
  12-hour standoff, police attempted to enter the house and the offender fired a
  shot at police, hitting an officer’s ballistic shield. He was not licensed to
  own a firearm, but was found with a prohibited .22 calibre long rifle, another
  bolt-action rifle and a .410 single shot shotgun. After eventually being
  arrested, the man was sentenced to six years’ prison, with the judge finding
  his mental health, affected by the death of his son, moderated his level of
  moral culpability. However, the judge noted that: “The offender maintains his
  sovereign citizen beliefs which often arouse tension when interacting with any
  branch of government or authority”. In another case, a man affiliated with a
  pseudo-legal group was charged with firearm offences after a police raid found
  firearms and ammunition hidden inside a piano. He was also not a licensed
  firearm owner. At the time of sentencing, the judge said that the group he led
  “promotes a sovereign citizen ideology”. Government warned of threat posed by
  conspiracy theories and guns In 2022, former Victorian Greens leader, Samantha
  Ratnam, secured the support of the Victorian government to establish a
  parliamentary inquiry into far-right extremism. While the inquiry was borne
  out of concerns about the rise of neo-Nazi activity, it also identified the
  growth of the ‘sovereign citizen’ movement during the pandemic, “in opposition
  to public health orders like vaccine and mask mandates and stay-at-home
  restrictions”. The inquiry found violent extremism posed a risk to politicians
  and public figures in Victoria, with access to firearms “obtained legally or
  illegally” by members of far-right groups a “significant concern”. Among its
  12 recommendations was to advocate for a national firearms database and review
  of the state Firearms Act, to expand the fit and proper person test to prevent
  people who are members of violent extremist groups obtaining a licence. The
  government accepted the recommendation but said the law already allowed police
  to refuse licence applications to members of extremist groups. Ratnam has
  described the response as “lacklustre”. “The government hasn’t taken the
  threat seriously, they just haven’t moved with the urgency that it
  necessitated. We were sounding the alarm because we could see it happening, we
  saw some of the thinking that was coming out of these groups first-hand,” she
  said. Her successor, Ellen Sandell, urged the government to revisit the
  recommendation. “The experts have given us the roadmap for how to stop the
  rise of far-right extremism and conspiracy theorists – now the Labor
  government must act,” Sandell said. However, the Victorian government’s
  position hasn’t changed. “Victoria has strong laws in relation to gun
  ownership and storage,” a government spokesperson said. They said there were
  early intervention schemes across prisons and community corrections services
  to combat signs of radicalisation, as well as programs in schools to address
  racism and racial discrimination.
