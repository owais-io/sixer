  My friend and former colleague Frank O’Gorman, who has died aged 84, spent his
  entire career in the department of history at the University of Manchester,
  advancing from an assistant lectureship in 1965 to a personal chair in 1992
  before retiring in 2002. A gifted teacher and a rigorous but popular tutor, he
  wrote a number of books on 18th- and 19th-century topics, including The Long
  Eighteenth Century (1997), which examined the transformational change that
  took place in Britain between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Reform
  Act of 1832. Born in Manchester, Frank was the son of Maud (nee Lewtas) and
  Ernest O’Gorman, a metal dresser with Metropolitan-Vickers. He was educated at
  St Bede’s college in Manchester, and graduated from the University of Leeds
  with a history degree before moving to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
  where he studied for a PhD. His book The Rise of Party in England: The
  Rockingham Whigs 1760-82, published in 1975, arose from that doctoral
  research. Outside his academic work at Manchester, where he and I were
  colleagues in the history department for many years, Frank loved cruises with
  his wife, Elsa (nee Buch Kristiensen), a college lecturer, whom he married in
  1965. He was also a good tennis player and continued with the game well into
  middle age. Interested in comedy writing, he took an MA in the subject at
  Salford University during his retirement. An extrovert with a generous, warm
  personality and a sardonic, often self-deprecating sense of humour, Frank
  enjoyed the company of close friends, with whom he would voice his trenchant
  views on current affairs. He is survived by Elsa, their two children, Annelise
  and Adam, and four grandchildren, Oscar, Mathilda, Kristian and Ellie.
