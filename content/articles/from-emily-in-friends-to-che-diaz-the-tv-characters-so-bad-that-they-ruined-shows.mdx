  shows

  Sometimes, all it takes to change your relationship to a TV show is one
  character. Viewers are all enjoying the One Day-meets-High Fidelity vibes of
  BBC Two’s nostalgic romance Mix Tape. However, none of them can stand the
  cassette-crossed lovers’ spouses. Yes, for every role that becomes a firm
  viewer favourite, another is reviled by the show’s fanbase. Lena Dunham’s
  latest creation, Too Much, seems to be entirely populated by unappealing
  characters. Meanwhile, Peppa Pig devotees are in a porcine pickle over the
  imminent onscreen arrival of a new little sister, baby piglet Evie. Cartoon
  swine devotees fear this gimmicky addition will upset the delicate balance of
  the four-way family unit that has been beloved by preschoolers for 21 years.
  If the oinking blockbuster ain’t broke, why fix it? The current hate figures
  won’t be the last to spoil a successful programme. We name and shame the
  unlucky 13 characters who ruined TV shows … Che Diaz (And Just Like That)
  Vanity Fair dubbed the character “divisive”. The New York Times called them
  “polarising”. Just two of the euphemisms for being downright awful. As
  Miranda’s love interest in the Sex and the City sequel, so-called comedian Che
  was much maligned as an unsubtle caricature of a non-binary person. The
  character simply made no sense, let alone as a match for the hitherto
  heterosexual Miranda. They spoke as if they had swallowed a gender studies
  textbook. They laughed at their own non-jokes. They generally jarred with
  fans. Some feel similarly about Carrie’s rekindled relationship with Aidan,
  with his mullet, whispery tones and cringe-inducing phone sex. Shudder. Bran
  Stark (Game of Thrones) That noise isn’t dire wolves; it’s howls of protest
  from fans. The problematically named “Bran the Broken” spent most of HBO’s
  fantasy saga on the sidelines – wearing furs, sitting in trees and making
  gnomic pronouncements like a creepy schoolkid in the corner of the playground.
  He even disappeared for an entire season and wasn’t much missed. No wonder it
  was, ahem, “controversial” when this passive fringe figure was suddenly picked
  as Ruler of the Six Kingdoms. A widely reviled choice. Uncle Albert (Only
  Fools and Horses) With mega-rated Christmas specials and a dodgy lock-up full
  of lovely jubbly catchphrases, the Trotter brothers once ruled the sitcom
  roost. Cushty. While they ducked ’n’ dived around Peckham, Grandad rarely left
  his armchair in Nelson Mandela House but added a bass note of world-weary,
  hat-clad, croaky-voiced craftiness. When the actor Lennard Pearce died in
  1984, he was replaced by the wackier Uncle Albert – a salty old sea dog with
  Captain Birds Eye’s beard and precisely one joke, which was starting every
  sentence with “During the war … ” The decline began, hastened by Del finding
  love with Raquel and Rodders falling for Cassandra. You plonkers. Scrappy-Doo
  (Scooby-Doo) “Puppy power! Lemme at ’em, Uncle Scoob! Scrappy dappy Doo!” Pipe
  down, you insufferable brat. When the Hanna-Barbera cartoon suffered a ratings
  slump, producers brought in Scooby’s rambunctious nephew to join the
  ghost-hunting gang as an uncalled-for comic foil. The annoying ankle-biter
  sparked an immediate backlash. “Zoinks,” indeed. Scrappy was so hated that The
  Simpsons mocked him with the rapping, surfing Poochie in
  cartoon-within-a-cartoon The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show. Emily
  Waltham (Friends) Crowbarring a token British actor into an American show
  rarely works. So it proved when Helen Baxendale earned a big-money transfer
  from Cold Feet to Friends. Intended to turn the Ross ’n’ Rachel saga into a
  love triangle, Emily was an unfunny wet blanket who just got in the way. She
  spent most of her screen time storming out of rooms in jealous huffs. Her
  arrival led to the ropy London episodes, complete with cameos from Sarah
  Ferguson and Richard Branson. Emily’s sole saving grace: the gasp-inducing
  moment when Ross accidentally said Rachel’s name at the altar. Pivot! Nate
  Shelley (Ted Lasso) The Apple TV+ hit is a feelgood sports-com about teamwork,
  optimism and compassion. Did it really need to turn one of its supporting
  characters into an unconvincing panto villain? Shortly after arriving to
  manage AFC Richmond, our titular hero spotted the kit man’s tactical nous,
  promoted him to assistant coach and nicknamed him Nate the Great. How did Nate
  repay him? By demanding all the credit for Richmond’s success, bullying
  colleagues and mocking his mentor’s panic attacks – before leaving to manage
  the club’s arch rival. Nate the Grate, more like. The Moon family (Frasier)
  Physiotherapist-cum-housekeeper Daphne Moon may have been lovable, but
  whenever her family from back home in Blighty turned up, it was painful to
  behold. Her brother Simon was a regular visitor to Seattle, appearing in nine
  episodes as a boozy, boorish numpty, but the actor Anthony LaPaglia
  inexplicably spoke in a ropy cockney accent, rather than a more logical
  Mancunian one. Even more inexplicably, he won an Emmy for the role. Equally
  bad was their battleaxe mother, Gertrude (Millicent Martin). Dana Brody
  (Homeland) The Showtime series was a tense, knotty espionage thriller about
  the cat-and-mouse relationship between CIA spook Carrie Mathison and
  Marine-turned-al-Qaida sleeper agent Sgt Nicholas Brody. Homeland wasn’t an
  angsty teen soap. Yet this is exactly what it turned into during scenes
  involving Brody’s sulking, whining daughter Dana. She at least met her
  petulant match in the vice-president’s hit-and-run driver son Finn, played by
  a 16-year-old Timothée Chalamet. Wonder what happened to that guy? In other
  “annoying offspring of TV action men” news, see Jack Bauer’s daughter Kim from
  24 – notably when she got trapped in a snare and menaced by a wild cougar.
  Dammit, Jack! Andy Bernard (The Office US) The Office: An American Workplace
  wasn’t just a rare US remake worthy of the British original. It became a truly
  great sitcom in its own right. Cracks appeared, however, when Dunder Mifflin
  boss Michael Scott departed and preppy sales rep Andy Bernard was promoted to
  regional manager. Arrogant and anger prone, he lacked Michael’s bumbling
  humanity and drained the show of its gentle charm. It was like replacing David
  Brent with Finchy. Henrik Sabroe (The Bridge) The first two series of the
  border-straddling Nordic noir were all-timers, following the unlikely duo of
  neurodiverse Swedish sleuth Saga Norén and her slobby, sarky Danish
  counterpart Martin Rohde. When the second run ended with Martin jailed, Saga
  needed a new sidekick, hence the arrival of the handsome but haunted Henrik.
  The pair soon entered into a relationship (eyeroll). With more focus on the
  detectives’ private lives, the crime drama lost its way. Back to Sarah Lund’s
  jumpers, then. Elsbeth Tascioni (The Good Wife) Recurring character Elsbeth
  was a Chicago defence attorney for whom words such as “quirky” and “kooky”
  might have been invented. All “I’m so random!” pronouncements and
  primary-coloured outfits, she was a tryhard irritant who somehow became a fan
  favourite. Amid the high-class legal drama, it felt as if she had wandered in
  from a tonally different, inferior show. Which she then got, landing her own
  spin-off, the Ronseal-titled Elsbeth. There’s no accounting for taste. Cousin
  Oliver (The Brady Bunch) The disastrous introduction of this previously
  unmentioned Brady family member coined the US terms “Cousin Oliver syndrome”
  and “add-a-kid” – shorthand for a failed bid to boost flagging ratings with a
  supposedly cute child. This blond, bespectacled devil spawn is among the most
  hated characters in sitcom history. Six episodes after Oliver’s arrival, ABC
  axed the show. A decade later came another example: Sam, the bowl-cut best
  friend of Gary Coleman’s Arnold, who joined the Diff’rent Strokes cast for its
  final two series. It might take diff’rent strokes to move the world, but Sam
  could do one. The Man in Black (Lost) The pointless polar bear. The hatch. The
  Others. The Dharma Initiative. The giant foot statue, Jack’s tattoos.
  Flashbacks, flash-forwards and sideways flashes. There were many points at
  which the plane crash drama disappeared up its own rear propeller but the
  clincher came when a middle-aged man in black became the personification of
  evil. He had previously appeared as the Smoke Monster, then was able to
  inhabit the dead. He turned out to be the villainous twin of the mysterious
  Jacob, white-clad protector of “The Heart of the Island”. All clear? Thought
  not.
