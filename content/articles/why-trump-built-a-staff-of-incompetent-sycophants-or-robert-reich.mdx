  Last week, Trump officials reportedly left behind documents describing
  confidential planning for the Trump-Putin meeting in a public area of an
  Alaskan hotel. That’s nothing compared with the actions of Emil Bove, Trump’s
  new nominee for the US court of appeals for the third circuit, who reputedly
  told subordinates at the Department of Justice that they should “consider
  telling the courts ‘fuck you’” and ignoring any court order blocking a planned
  deportation flight. Then there’s Billy Long, a former auctioneer and
  Republican congressman who Trump nominated and was confirmed less than two
  months ago to head the Internal Revenue Service, with “little background in
  tax policy beyond promoting a fraud-riddled tax credit”. Long has already been
  fired after clashing with the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Long was the
  sixth person to head the IRS this year. Let’s not forget EJ Antoni, whom Trump
  just nominated to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after firing former
  chief Erika McEntarfer for presiding over a disappointing jobs report earlier
  this month. Antoni is that rarity who has drawn harsh criticism from
  economists on the right as well as the mainstream for being ignorant,
  unprincipled and incompetent. He recently celebrated that “all net job growth
  over the last year went to native-born Americans”. I haven’t even mentioned
  the towering ineptitude of Trump’s cabinet picks, such as Pete Hegseth, Pam
  Bondi, Kash Patel, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kristi Noem. How to explain the
  rise of so many incompetent and unprincipled people? Easy. They could never
  succeed on their own merits. As soon as their incompetence became apparent –
  which was likely to be as soon as they took the first job that required some
  degree of intelligence and integrity – they were fired. So they learned that
  to be rewarded with promotions, money and power, they cannot rely on the
  normal processes and systems of recognition for jobs well done. If they’re to
  make anything of themselves, they must instead become ass-lickers, lap dogs
  and sycophants. They must latch on to someone who values loyalty above
  integrity or competence, someone for whom fawning obsequiousness is the most
  important criterion for being hired and promoted, ideally someone who cannot
  tell the difference between a groveling toady and a knowledgeable adviser.
  Enter Trump. History is strewn with the wreckage of dictatorships that have
  attracted and promoted incompetent people lacking talent or integrity. As
  Hannah Arendt explained in her classic The Origins of Totalitarianism:
  Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents,
  regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of
  intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.
  Early in his career, Trump apprenticed himself to Roy Cohn, an unprincipled
  lawyer who taught the young Trump how to gain wealth and influence through
  ruthless bullying, profane braggadocio, opportunistic bigotry, baseless
  lawsuits, lying, and more lying. Yet as Trump’s “fixer” with politicians,
  judges and mob bosses, Cohn remained utterly loyal to Trump and his father,
  Fred. Years later, in his book The Art of the Deal, Trump drew a distinction
  between integrity and loyalty. He preferred the latter, and for him, Cohn
  exemplified it. Trump contrasted Cohn with all the hundreds of ‘respectable’
  guys who made careers out of boasting about their uncompromising integrity but
  have absolutely no loyalty …. What I liked most about Roy Cohn was that he
  would do just the opposite. Cohn died a disgrace, disbarred by the New York
  State Bar for unethical conduct after attempting to defraud a dying client by
  forcing him to sign a will amendment leaving Cohn his fortune. People who
  climb upward by sacrificing their integrity to slavish subservience almost
  always fall on their faces eventually. Blind ambition trips them up. They
  cannot explain or defend their behavior by relying on principled competence
  because, like Cohn, they are unprincipled and incompetent to their cores. The
  people they latch onto meet similar fates but for a different reason. Leaders
  who value loyalty above all else find themselves surrounded by sycophantic
  crackpots and fools. As a result, they receive no objective or useful feedback
  about their actions – no warnings beforehand and no criticism afterward. All
  they get are commendations – “Wonderful idea, sir!” “Brilliant execution,
  sir!” These cocoons of flattery seal off such leaders from the real-world
  consequences of what they do – which inevitably leads them to make grave
  mistakes. Some of those mistakes eventually cause their downfalls. This
  perverse symmetry – the certain demise of grovelers because they’re
  incompetent and unprincipled and the inevitable downfall of those to whom they
  grovel because they never get useful and truthful feedback – marks the path of
  all totalitarian systems. It’s the path on which Trump now treads. This is not
  necessarily cause for hope. If history is any guide, many innocent people
  suffer before the incompetent grovelers and the vain objects of their
  groveling meet their inevitable fates. America and the world are already
  suffering. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of
  public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a
  Guardian US columnist. His newsletter is at robertreich.substack.com. His new
  book, Coming Up Short: A Memoir of My America, is out now
