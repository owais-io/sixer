  The legality of the system designed to penalise jobseekers has been thrown
  into doubt after the commonwealth ombudsman found a government department’s
  automatic system unlawfully cancelled payments. The ombudsman has found 964
  jobseekers had their payments unlawfully cancelled between April 2022 and July
  2024 by the automated IT system that underpins the targeted compliance
  framework system. TCF is designed to make sure jobseekers meet requirements
  such as attending meetings with an employment provider and applying for jobs
  to continue to receive their payments. Payment cancellations have been paused
  since January after the government found a further 1,326 people had financial
  penalties “applied incorrectly” due to an IT issue. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email On top of this, 45 people had their payments illegally cancelled because
  the system continued to operate in error. On Wednesday the ombudsman found the
  payments had been cancelled unlawfully and recommended the government continue
  to pause cancellations until the it could review the legality of the entire
  TCF system. The ombudsman, Iain Anderson, said he had investigated
  cancellations in which public servants working at the Department of Employment
  and Workplace Relations had failed to consider individual circumstances before
  cancelling a payment as laid down by law. “They were just automating the
  cancellation without considering the individual circumstances of the jobseeker
  and whether it was appropriate to cancel the payment or not,” he told Guardian
  Australia. “The target compliance framework itself has been very problematic
  in that regard.” Anderson said that in 2022 DEWR was also meant to put in a
  “digital protection framework” to ensure jobseekers were treated fairly but
  the department had failed to do so. Anderson said the secretary of DEWR,
  Natalie James, needed to be “completely confident” the system was working
  properly before the cancellations resume. “The targeted compliance framework
  has had a number of different problems, and so the secretary of DEWR needs to
  do much more than simply look at the unlawful cancellation issue. “They need
  to be really certain that the entire target compliance framework is going to
  comply with the law and be fair.” He said there were also concerns as to
  whether the suspension of payments, which happens in tens of thousands of
  cases each month, was legal. “We have some concerns as to whether the
  suspension process is happening fairly and reasonably,” he said. On top of
  this, Guardian Australia understands a Deloitte report into the IT system that
  underpins the TCF has found that it is not functioning within the proper legal
  frameworks. The Deloitte report – which has yet to be published – recommends
  overhauling the TCF’s IT system to ensure that the suspension or cancellation
  of payments is done legally. The Greens have called for the government to
  abolish the TCF and release the report. “It is clear that the TCF is an
  expensive hangover from a conservative government which has been heartlessly
  prolonged by this Labor government for far too long,” Senator Penny
  Allman-Payne said. The DEWR is also conducting a legal review to examine the
  way decisions are being made under the legislation. The ombudsman will
  continue to investigate the TCF with another report due out later in the year.
