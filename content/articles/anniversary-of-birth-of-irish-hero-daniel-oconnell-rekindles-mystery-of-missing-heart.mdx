  missing heart

  On his deathbed Daniel O’Connell, the man known in his time as “the Liberator”
  of Ireland, made a request: “My body to Ireland, my heart to Rome and my soul
  to heaven.” On Wednesday Ireland marked the 250th anniversary of his birth
  with speeches and pomp and a nagging question: where is the heart? After his
  death in 1847 O’Connell’s heart was sent to Rome and kept as a prized relic in
  the Irish College at St Agata dei Goti, or the church of the Goths, but in
  1927 authorities discovered it was gone. It is still missing, and the
  commemorations this week prompted calls for a renewed search to find it. “It’s
  a travesty if it was just left like that,” Maurice O’Connell, the statesman’s
  great-great-great-grandnephew, told RTÉ. “I think with the 250th anniversary,
  if you’re not going to search now, you’re never going to do it, so at least
  there’s some impetus behind it. I’m sure there’s interest in government to
  help the Daniel O’Connell story. But you’ve got to try and find it.” The
  descendant would like to see the heart laid to rest on Abbey Island in County
  Kerry, where O’Connell’s wife, Mary, is buried. “It would be fantastic if the
  heart was reunited with her.” The Kerry-born barrister and MP became the
  founding father of Irish nationalism by securing Catholic emancipation and
  leading an attempt to repeal the Act of Union that incorporated Ireland into
  the UK. His oratory and mobilisation of huge rallies inspired civil rights
  movements around the world. William Gladstone called O’Connell “the greatest
  popular leader the world has ever seen”. Statues of him dot Irish towns and
  cities, his name adorns thoroughfares and his remains lie beneath a round
  tower in Dublin’s Glasnevin cemetery. Of his heart, however, there is no
  trace. The heart was embalmed and is believed to have been placed in an urn
  stored behind a marble plaque in the wall of the Irish College’s church. When
  the Irish College moved to another location in 1927 there was no sign of the
  urn. One theory is that it was swept up with other remains during works to
  expand the Bank of Italy, which encroached into the church’s crypt, and
  reinterred at the Campo Verano cemetery. Another theory is that it was
  transferred to a silver casket that was then targeted by thieves. “What a
  tragedy to think that the heart of O’Connell could have been swept up and
  taken and stolen,” a historian, John Crotty, told RTÉ. “But that is the
  worst-case scenario. The distinct hope has to be that it was swept up in the
  Campo Verano move, or that it does remain underneath the chapel of the Goths
  still to this day.”
