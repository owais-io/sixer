  Chris Froome suffered a life-threatening injury to his heart in the training
  crash in France last week that left him hospitalised with a broken back and
  broken ribs. The four-time Tour de France winner also sustained a pericardial
  rupture, a tear to the sac that surrounds the heart, in the crash. “It was
  obviously a lot more serious than some broken bones,” his wife, Michelle
  Froome, told the Times. “He’s fine, but it’s going to be a long recovery
  process. He won’t be riding a bike for a while.” Froome was airlifted to the
  Sainte Anne Toulon military hospital, in the Var, the highest level trauma
  centre in that part of France. His team, Israel-Premier Tech, had initially
  stated that the 40-year-old had suffered a collapsed lung, five broken ribs
  and a lumbar vertebrae fracture. Last spring, Froome was reluctant to
  speculate on his retirement date. “I haven’t 100% decided that I’ll be
  retiring at the end of this year,” he said. “Chances are, yes, I’ll be calling
  it a day, but I’m just keeping the door open.” However, the gravity of the
  injuries he suffered in the crash has now increased speculation that he may
  soon announce his retirement from racing. Meanwhile, the Dutch sprinter Olav
  Kooij, teammate of Jonas Vingegaard at Visma-Lease a Bike, overhauled Norway’s
  Tord Gudmestad to win the opening stage of the 2025 men’s Tour of Britain in
  Southwold. Kooij, who took four stage wins in the 2023 edition of the race,
  picked up where he left off on the Suffolk coast, but only after overhauling a
  violent acceleration from the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider. “It was a lot
  of headwind after the last corner and a little rise as well,” he said. “It was
  a bit of a waiting game, to make the last push in the final few metres.
  Gudmestad was really strong, but he was pushing into the wind and I had some
  slipstream from him. I had enough in the legs to get past him.” Kooij has
  already set his sights on adding to his British win tally. “I don’t think I’ll
  beat getting four wins like I did a few years ago,” he said. Geraint Thomas,
  riding his final professional race, almost missed the start to his own
  farewell party after his flight to Stansted airport, late on Monday evening,
  was delayed. “I wasn’t sure if I was going to get here yesterday, with the
  flights and stuff,” he said before the stage began. “Flights were being
  cancelled all over the place.” In the end, Thomas arrived at his race hotel in
  the early hours of the morning and got only a few hours sleep. “The main thing
  is enjoying it, really making the most of it. I’m not really in the shape to
  win myself, but we’ve got some good guys here to perform,” he said of his
  Ineos Grenadiers team.
