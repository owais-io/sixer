  Michael Adams edged nearer the all-time record for British Championship titles
  last weekend when the Taunton-based grandmaster won his ninth national
  championship at Liverpool. Adams, who relaxes by watching cricket at
  Somerset’s county ground, has now equalled Henry Atkins’s total of nine
  championships from the first half of the last century, but remains one short
  of Jonathan Penrose’s 10 crowns from the second half. Adams’s first British
  title was in 1989 at age 17, still the youngest ever, but in the next 20 years
  he concentrated on the world championship, coming within a hair’s breadth of a
  reunification match with Garry Kasparov in 2004 before losing in the Fide
  final. Starting with 2010, Adams made the British championship his priority,
  and he won five crowns in the next decade. Literally so, for the event trophy
  has been in the shape of a crown since the very first championship in 1904,
  and engravers now struggle to find space on it to add new names. Between 2010
  and 2019 Adams won the British title five times, setting up his current record
  attempt. He still retains his international ambitions, is the reigning world
  over-50 champion, and is competing in the strong Rubinstein Memorial beginning
  on Friday at Polanica-Zdroj, Poland. Two titles are still required before
  Adams can surpass the 10 championships of the late Penrose, and that may be
  difficult. A new generation of talents is emerging in England, encouraged by a
  £1.5m support grant over three years for elite talents announced by the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, last month. The funding, which will start in April
  2026, will be split equally between the Department for Education and the
  Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The pre-tournament favourite and top
  seed was Nikita Vitiugov, but the former Russian champion struggled to find
  his best form and was defeated decisively by Stuart Conquest in the final
  round, in an encounter which was awarded the joint best game prize. The 2025
  championship was keenly fought, with six players sharing the lead at the start
  of round nine. Adams won after a speed tie-break with fellow veteran Conquest,
  58. Final leading scores were Adams, Conquest, and Peter Roberson (eliminated
  in the first round of tie-breaks) 7/9, Gawain Maroroa Jones, Svyatoslav
  Bazakutsa (Ukraine), and Jonah Willow 6.5. The championship marked a
  breakthrough for junior talent. England’s youngest ever grandmaster Shreyas
  Royal, 17, was among the leaders for seven rounds, including an elegant win
  against Marcus Harvey, before falling into a trap against Conquest. Bodhana
  Sivanandan, 10, continues to break records. The Harrow primary schoolgirl, who
  at eight won three world girls gold medals with a combined total of 33
  straight wins, achieved her third and final norm for the WIM title with a 2300
  rating performance, a full year younger than the previous record. In the final
  round, Sivanandan became the youngest girl ever to defeat a grandmaster in a
  classical game when GM Peter Wells overstepped the time limit in a lost
  position. At 10 years five months, Sivanandan was six months younger than the
  previous world record holder, Carissa Yip of the US, who defeated GM Alexander
  Ivanov at the 2014 New England Open (not 2019, as widely misquoted) aged 10
  years 11 months. Yip has been the US woman champion for the past two years.
  Three-time British champion and taketaketake.com host David Howell called
  Sivanandan’s achievement “extraordinary”. Supratit Banerjee did best of the
  rising talents. The Surrey 11-year-old achieved his first international master
  norm, easily a UK age record, defeated two grandmasters in succession, and
  displayed remarkable maturity and stamina, including drawing a 145-move game.
  Banerjee is again in action this week at the Kingston Invitational organised
  by the Guardian’s Stephen Moss followed immediately by the Northumbria Masters
  in Newcastle. It is a tough schedule for an 11-year-old. The Mindsports
  International is also under way in London. There was criticism of the British
  Championship format after round eight of nine came with 28 players, more than
  a quarter of the field, separated by just a single point. Possible remedies
  are to restore an 11-round championship, with two extra double round days
  early on; and/or raising the rating floor for entries. However, Alex
  Holowczak, the influential English Chess Federation director of events, has
  said: “I see one round per day as sacrosanct for the British.” The prize money
  (Adams received £4,400) is low for an era in which life-changing amounts are
  on offer for international chess events. When the government grant for elite
  talent becomes available, it would be reasonable to earmark at least £25,000
  to boost the national championship prize money at the University of Warwick in
  August 2026. In 1954, first prize in the British Championship was £35 and
  second was £15. They were shared after several weeks of a 10-game playoff.
  Just saying … 3985: 1…Rxd6! 2 Qxd6 (else Black wins with his extra knight)
  Bf3! 3 Resigns. If 3 g3 (to stop Qxg2 mate) Qc1+ 4 Bd1 Qxd1+ 5 Kh2 Qh1 mate.
