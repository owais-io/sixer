  During Dan Ndoye’s couple of seasons at Bologna, he kept a few shirts – with
  his name and number on the reverse – stashed in the glove box of his car in
  case he bumped into young supporters around town. Naturally, he had a pen
  handy for autographs, too. It is a nugget that epitomises his down-to-earth
  character, which radiates as he discusses his £35m move to Nottingham Forest
  this summer. “If I can give away a couple of shirts here, I will do so with
  pleasure,” he says. “Sometimes a small gesture can make a big difference.” As
  a kid who idolised Neymar, a signed shirt from one of his heroes was the stuff
  of dreams. Ndoye, who trained with his Forest teammates for the first time
  last week, was born in Nyon to a Senegalese father, Saliou, and a Swiss
  mother, Virginie, and came through the ranks at Lausanne. The 24-year-old
  values his African roots – he visits his grandmother in Dakar when time allows
  – and incorporated them into his now-trademark celebration, where he mimics a
  growling big cat displaying its claws. “I was always asking myself: ‘What
  celebration can I do that represents myself?’ The Senegal national team are
  known as the Lions of Teranga and my mum, since I was a kid, always called me
  a little lion, because every time I would always give my best.” Ndoye is
  family-oriented; for example, he has selected the No 14 shirt at Forest
  because it is the date of his mum’s birthday in April. His husky, Alpha, which
  his sister, Eva, persuaded him to get a few years ago, helps take his mind off
  things when needed. “I’ve worked really hard to arrive here. There have been
  ups and downs but I’m a focused person. I always try to give my best, and I
  think if you do that you’ll get your rewards. It’s been a long journey, but I
  think this is the beginning. I have a lot of work to do to improve again. I
  want to become a better player.” Those who have shared his journey speak of an
  authentic, upbeat character who is almost always smiling. “I am just living my
  dream because I always dreamed of being a football player,” he says. It has
  been a fine 12 months for Ndoye, who starred for Switzerland at Euro 2024 then
  enjoyed a breakout season in Serie A; he scored eight goals, plus the only
  goal against Milan in Rome at Stadio Olimpico to clinch the Coppa Italia,
  sparking joyous scenes in Piazza Maggiore. “It was an amazing experience to
  win the club’s first trophy for 51 years and something that will always stay
  with me. Now I’m ready to give my best in my new shirt and I hope it’s going
  to be a good season.” He reflects fondly on his time in Bologna and got under
  the skin of the city. Ndoye often attended basketball matches at Virtus
  Bologna, the oldest team in Italy and one of the oldest across Europe. He is a
  big basketball fan and in the summer Switzerland’s double-header in the US
  presented the chance to study Utah Jazz at close quarters as part of a
  team-bonding event. “I like to see other sports and see how they work and I
  like to take a bit of everything from every sport I like so that I can put it
  into my professional journey.” He enjoyed quizzing the coaches and honed his
  technique under the hoop. “I try, but I’m not so good, you know,” he says with
  a smile. Ndoye had interest from the Serie A winners, Napoli, who will play in
  the Champions League this season, but preferred Forest, where he signed a
  five-year contract. A positive rundown of the club from Remo Freuler, his
  Bologna teammate who played for Forest, helped. Joshua Zirkzee and Riccardo
  Calafiori, also former clubmates, could also paint a picture. “As soon as I
  got the interest from Forest, I knew that it was the perfect next step for my
  career. I spoke with the directors and the coach and it was really clear for
  me that was the right move for me. If I choose this club, it’s because I’m
  fully confident in my choice. I spoke a lot with my family about it. I know
  it’s an ambitious club, and I’m ambitious as well. I think we can achieve
  great things, there’s a great manager and team. If we put everything together,
  it can be a really good season for us.” Nuno Espírito Santo hopes Ndoye will
  provide Forest with a bounce after the £55m departure of Anthony Elanga for
  Newcastle. This week Nuno voiced concerns his team were “short of solutions”
  but in Ndoye, who made a name for himself as an instrumental part of the Basel
  side that reached the Conference League semi-finals two years ago, they have a
  player determined to hit the ground running. He concedes he may need to adapt
  to the intensity of the Premier League but his English needs little work. “I
  used to watch things like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. Every time if I
  can put something on in English – with the subtitles in French – it can help
  me.” Forest begin at home to Brentford on Sunday and will play in Europe for
  the first time in 30 years; Crystal Palace’s demotion to the Conference League
  means Forest, who finished seventh, will play in the Europa League. The
  Premier League, which Ndoye says is the best in the world, was the obvious
  lure but those European nights promise to be magical occasions. “To bring
  European football to the City Ground will be something special … I’m proud to
  be part of this journey.”
