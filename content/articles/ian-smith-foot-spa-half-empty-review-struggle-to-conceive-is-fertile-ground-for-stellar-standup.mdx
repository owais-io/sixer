  Ian Smith: Foot Spa Half Empty review – struggle to conceive is fertile ground
  for stellar standup
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  Reviewing Ian Smith’s breakout show Crushing two summers ago, I compared the
  Yorkshireman to Rhod Gilbert, another comic who gets very het up at the most
  trivial provocation. Smith’s follow-up show mirrors Gilbert in a different
  way, by addressing an issue the Welshman became associated with in standup and
  documentary: infertility. Foot Spa Half Empty is about Smith’s low sperm
  count, discovered as he and his partner start trying for a child. It arranges
  a suite of humiliating stories and manic overthinking comedy around the more
  substantial tale of our host’s visit to a clinic to have his sperm tested – in
  Smith’s hands, it’s as surefire an anecdote for self-abasing standup as it’s
  possible to imagine. Give or take a weak ending, it’s a killer stage return
  from a man now increasingly recognisable from your TV screens. Not that fame
  has gone to his head; Google (“people also search for Robert Mugabe”) has seen
  to that. He did briefly worry that success might defang a comic style rooted
  in anxiety and failure. But lo, big-time Smith still sweats the small stuff,
  and very funnily. See his section about being mocked for being a poor skier,
  another deconstructing the phrase “wrong place, wrong time”, and a memorable
  set piece about a gull with a steak knife in its beak harassing punters in a
  beer garden. These are big-impact routines, all the funnier for their tone of
  voice, which combines a relish for the absurd, an inability to let things go
  and an adhesive relationship with indignity. All come into play as the
  36-year-old relates his fertility journey, which finds him buying a magic
  spell from Amazon (“And if that worked, I’m scared of that baby …”),
  roadtesting old wives’ tales, and pontificating on the milestones that signal
  we’re getting old – which include, in Smith’s case, a father-son tutorial in
  extra-strong mints. You can bet that phrase “extra strong” gets a workout from
  Smith: not a man to leave a casual figure of speech un-interrogated. It may be
  wearisome to possess, but Smith’s worrisome personality is catnip for comedy
  lovers. With him at the mic, laughs, at least, go forth and multiply. • At
  Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
