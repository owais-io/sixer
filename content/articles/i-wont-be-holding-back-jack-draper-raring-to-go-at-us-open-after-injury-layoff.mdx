  Jack Draper believes he will not be held back by any physical pain as he faces
  the challenge of finding his form at the US Open after a seven-week injury
  hiatus. Draper, the fifth seed in New York, has not competed in singles since
  a difficult loss to Marin Cilic in the second round of Wimbledon after
  learning that he had been suffering from bone bruising in his left arm. “It
  was something I was playing through for a while,” said Draper, who plays the
  qualifier Federico Agustin Gómez in the first round on Monday. “I first
  started feeling it probably towards the middle of the clay season. I felt like
  my arm was shutting down a little bit when I was hitting forehands and on the
  serve. It kind of got progressively worse. Then on the grass it got quite
  painful. So I didn’t know what I was dealing with. “After the grass, I got it
  checked out. I had some bone stress, bone bruising, in my humerus on my left
  side. It is one of those where, if you keep playing with it, it could become
  very, very serious. So I had to take some time out. Saying that, it was not so
  bad, because I could obviously do a lot of other things as well physically. It
  wasn’t like I had to stop completely.” Although he was in pain at times during
  the grass season, Draper does not believe the injury played any role in his
  Wimbledon loss, which he said was purely down to his struggles to adapt to the
  surface. “It’s an injury which takes time to heal,” said Draper. “A bone can
  heal, but it might be giving me some discomfort, that’s for sure. It’s not
  something which I’m going to go out on Monday and feel like it’s holding me
  back at all. But at the same time, I have been looking after this for the last
  month or so, so I’m looking forward to just getting back to competing. I think
  that will take my mind off a lot of things. I don’t feel like I’ll be holding
  back at all.”
