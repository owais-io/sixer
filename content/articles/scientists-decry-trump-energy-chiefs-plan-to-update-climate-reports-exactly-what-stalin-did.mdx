  The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, is facing growing criticism from
  scientists who say their “worst fears” were realized when Wright revealed that
  the Trump administration would “update” the US’s premier climate crisis
  reports. Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins
  earlier this week that the administration was reviewing national climate
  assessment reports published by past governments. Produced by scientists and
  peer-reviewed, there have been five national climate assessment (NCA) reports
  since 2000 and they are considered the gold standard report of global heating
  and its impacts on human health, agriculture, water supplies and air
  pollution. “We’re reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on
  those and with comments on those reports,” said Wright, who is one of the main
  supporters of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil
  fuels, which are the primary cause of the climate crisis. Wright was speaking
  days after his agency, the Department of Energy, produced a report claiming
  concern over the climate crisis was overblown. That energy department report
  was slammed by scientists for being a “farce” full of misinformation. Speaking
  to CNN this week about the national climate assessment reports, Wright claimed
  they “weren’t fair in broad-based assessments of climate change”. He added:
  “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find
  stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said. In recent weeks the
  Trump administration deleted the website that hosted the periodic, legally
  mandated, national climate assessments (the most recent report is hosted on
  the Guardian website and can be read in full here). Asked about Wright’s
  comments on the national climate assessment reports, respected climate
  scientist Michael Mann said in an emailed comment to the Guardian: “This is
  exactly what Joseph Stalin did.” In a statement on Thursday, Dr Rachel
  Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and one of the
  authors of the sixth NCA report due in 2028 that the administration dismissed
  earlier this year, said she was dismayed by Wright’s comments. “Secretary
  Wright just confirmed our worst fears – that this administration plans to not
  just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to
  downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing
  it. “The process for developing the congressionally mandated National Climate
  Assessment reports is rigorous, with federal agencies and hundreds of
  scientists constructing this solid scientific foundation that decision makers,
  businesses and the public rely on to stay safe in a world made more perilous
  each day by climate change. “People across the country are already reeling
  from climate-fueled worsening heatwaves, floods, wildfires and storms. Lying
  about that reality doesn’t change it; it just leaves people in harm’s way. We
  urge Congress to intervene to safeguard the integrity of the NCA reports so
  they remain vital, lifesaving tools in the fight against climate change.” The
  NCA reports are published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration (Noaa) and a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNN that
  Wright was “not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports”. In
  May, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union
  said they would join forces to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate
  crisis’s impact after the NCA contributors for the 2028 publication were
  dismissed. The energy department’s climate report last week was published on
  the same day the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to undo
  the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which allows the agency to limit
  planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other
  industrial sources. This raised concerns that the Trump administration was
  attempting to scrap almost all pollution regulations in steps likely to
  trigger battles in the courts in the coming years.
