  blind box toys like Labubus

  Jess has never touched a slot machine, played the lottery or bought a
  scratch-off, but she fears she may have a gambling problem nonetheless. This
  July, the 28-year-old found herself spending up to $270 a week on blind boxes
  – that is, surprise items that are sold in sealed, opaque packaging.
  Activewear companies, bookshops and even candy stores all sell mystery bundles
  of their products, but the brands currently dominating the market produce
  collectible toys with cute but unusual names. If you want a complete
  collection of Labubu, Smiski, Dimoo, Pucky, Skullpanda or Sonny Angel
  figurines, then you will have to buy blind box after blind box, sighing at
  every duplicate and praying the next package contains the creature you need to
  finish the set. “It’s silly but it is very addictive,” says Jess, who is based
  in Ireland but prefers not to reveal her full name or occupation. Jess started
  buying Labubu dolls in April after seeing them on TikTok: these strange,
  toothsome and fuzzy monsters have exploded in popularity this year thanks to
  celebrity endorsements and social media hype. Pop Mart, the Chinese company
  behind Labubus and many other mystery collectibles, is now estimated to be
  worth $40bn – but in June, the company’s stock briefly plunged after a Chinese
  state media publication condemned blind box marketing as predatory. Jess
  believes she is addicted to blind boxes: after she tried banning herself from
  buying them in July, she “snapped” and suddenly found herself ordering 25
  more. Sitting at home and waiting for parcels to arrive, she would itch to go
  out and physically get some more: “I would end up buying stuff that I didn’t
  care about just for the thrill of opening a box.” Jess found herself
  purchasing mystery plushies from the brand Squishmallows, which she doesn’t
  even like. “I’d open them and be like, ‘Why do I now have this squishy
  lobster?’” Jess says opening blind boxes feels like gambling because of the
  highs and lows: “Whenever you get the one that you want, it’s unreal.” On
  social media, it’s easy to see the impulse buying provoked by blind box
  marketing. In one TikTok video with 2.6m likes, a woman buys a $27.99
  Skullpanda, looks at the list of possible toys inside the box and says she
  would “be happy with any of them” except the Christmas tree dolls. Lo and
  behold, the box contains the Christmas tree, and – visibly frustrated – she
  rushes back to the store to buy a second box. Another $27.99 later, she
  becomes the less-than-proud owner of two Christmas trees. In a different
  video, a man buys six bags of mystery Disney pins at $44.99 each, but after
  ending up with 17 duplicates and an incomplete set, goes back to buy two more,
  bringing his total spend to almost $360. And some buyers don’t just seek the
  toys they personally like – they also hunt for the “rare” or “secret” items
  that are more uncommon and thus more valuable. “The buyer’s guilt that I get
  nearly every time after I’ve spent is insane,” Jess says, adding that she
  could have used the money for her forthcoming wedding. “If it were to continue
  like this, it would become dire, because who can pop off £1,000 [$1,300] in a
  couple of months on literal shit?” Jess says she feels “debilitated” by her
  habit. “Sometimes I open things and I don’t want them.” Dana Nguyen is a
  27-year-old from Monterey, California, who has spent $4,000 on Labubu dolls
  since the start of this year (on the Pop Mart website, Labubu dolls and
  figurines range in price from $19.99 to $959.50 each). This April, Nguyen
  realised she had a problem when she went to her PO Box and saw 20 parcels
  waiting for her. “I’m telling myself I want to fly to Europe, I want to travel
  the world, but how can I do that if I’m spending $4,000 on fur, cotton, vinyl,
  whatever these things are made of?” When asked to describe the feeling she
  gets when opening blind boxes, she says: “Honestly, that’s gambling. I’m gonna
  say it flat out: it’s straight gambling. “I always tell myself I won’t be one
  of those people in Vegas gambling on the slot machines or on the tables – and
  then I’m over here doing the exact same thing.” *** Adults in America are
  buying more toys than ever before. In the first half of 2025, the number of
  toys bought for grownups increased 18% – and in 2024, adults bought more toys
  for themselves than for preschoolers for the very first time. Enthusiasts
  offer easy explanations for their “kidulting”, summarised neatly in one BBC
  headline: “Adults buying kids’ toys to escape global turmoil.” As Nguyen puts
  it: “You’re already struggling as it is, with the economy, with society, and
  you think: OK, let me just have a little sweet treat because I’m not able to
  afford other luxuries in life.” Meanwhile, collecting is a very compelling
  habit. Cary Lee is an Australia-based marketing specialist who researches
  consumer behaviour. Lee has found six main reasons that people collect,
  including a sense of achievement, an extension of selfhood, community
  membership and a desire for a legacy. Lee’s studies have shown that the
  financial motivation to build a collection (for instance, the idea it might be
  worth something one day) is relatively weak compared with these intrinsic,
  emotional incentives. “We have an innate part of us which wants to acquire
  items to make a collection,” he says. Toy companies, of course, are well aware
  of this. In a 2020 prospectus for potential investors, Pop Mart wrote: “While
  traditional toys are primarily for children to play with, pop toys target
  young adults between 15 years old and 40 years old in general, who seek for
  emotional value from expressing personality and attitude.” The company
  declared itself “relentless” in its desire to “attract and build a
  fast-growing, young and passionate fanbase” and argued that blind boxes in
  particular inspire repeat purchases “due to unpredictability and fun”. In
  2019, Pop Mart asked market research company Frost &amp; Sullivan to survey
  more than 1,000 consumers and found that, “around 70% of pop toy consumers
  would purchase blind box toys three times or more for a specific toy design
  they want”. Lee has conducted studies on blind boxes and has found that most
  US consumers often come across their first blind box in stores and buy them
  impulsively. Yet regardless of the outcome – whether they get the toy they
  like the look of or a dud – people are often compelled to go back and buy
  another box. One of Lee’s papers uncovered “an addictive loop of impulsive
  purchases”, arguing there was “a ‘dark side’ to a seemingly innocuous
  product”. Online, an oft-repeated defence for the hyperconsumption of
  collectible toys is: “It makes me happy. It’s not harming anyone” – but is
  that really true? Beyond the environmental impact – not only are the toys
  themselves plastic, the packaging is often elaborate and multilayered to add
  to the thrill of unboxing – there is also personal wellbeing to consider.
  Nguyen says she initially hid the scale of her spending from her husband
  (whose business she helps run), and her mental health suffered at the peak of
  her blind box addiction. “I have bipolar and I have very manic episodes where
  I’m willing to take more risks than I normally would,” she says. After
  high-energy episodes, sometimes she finds herself irritable and in a low mood.
  “You just want a little quick fix. It’s a perfect selling point for people
  like me who are struggling with their mental health, to just have that little
  sweet treat, to have that little bit of serotonin or dopamine in their
  systems.” Now that she has restricted herself to purchasing fewer blind boxes,
  Nguyen says: “I feel like my nervous system has calmed a lot more.” Eddie is a
  34-year-old cashier from Mississippi who recently spent about $400 on blind
  boxes in a single month. “It made me feel sick to my stomach because I didn’t
  feel like I was in control of what I was spending,” he says. “I’d immediately
  have buyer’s remorse after making a purchase, and sometimes, I wasn’t even
  excited to get the package. I was more worried about the damage I’d done to my
  savings and finances.” A burgeoning field of study into these gambling-like
  mechanisms and their impact has researchers concerned. Leon Xiao is an
  assistant professor at the City University of Hong Kong who researches video
  game law and the challenges of regulating gambling-like products. Xiao’s work
  has historically focused on “loot boxes”, which are digital blind boxes sold
  for real money inside video games. (The items inside often help players
  perform better in the game.) Yet Xiao is intrigued by the increased
  “gamblification” of physical merchandise. “I’ve seen T-shirts being sold in
  blind boxes, chocolates in blind boxes,” he says. While Xiao pours cold water
  on one Chinese study published in 2022, which found that engaging with blind
  boxes was positively associated with suicide risk in young people – “that’s
  obviously going too far. There’s also a paper about drinking milk tea or boba
  linked to suicidal ideation” – he is troubled by other research findings. One
  longitudinal study published in 2023 found that young people who bought loot
  boxes participated in more gambling six months later than those who did not.
  One of Xiao’s own studies has found a correlation between buying mystery card
  packs and experiencing gambling problems. And a paper published this July
  argued that loot box spending can be associated with psychological distress
  and an increased risk of “extreme distress”. Xiao says: “We are concerned
  about vulnerable people spending more money and experiencing harm.” Xiao
  wonders whether new consumer laws might be the answer. In China, a set of
  advisory guidelines released in 2022 asked companies to publish probability
  disclosures, set age and spending limits, and even implement “pity mechanics”
  whereby customers are offered the item they desire after making a number of
  purchases. These guidelines also banned the sale of blind boxes to kids under
  age eight and required older children obtain parental permission before buying
  them – but in practice, enforcement is not so stringent. In the US, the
  Federal Trade Commission has looked into video game loot boxes and even fined
  one developer $20m for unfairly marketing to children and misleading players
  about the odds, but the FTC declined to comment on blind boxes when contacted
  by the Guardian. In 2018, loot boxes were declared illegal under existing
  gambling laws in Belgium, but Xiao’s research has found that enforcement
  remains a problem there, too. Jesper Andersson is a 23-year-old from Sweden
  who realised in 2024 that he had spent more than $4,000 in just a few months
  on mystery packs in the video game Fifa. “I’ve gambled normally on football
  and stuff like that, but I get anxious if I even lose $10. But when I drop
  $100 on Fifa, I don’t even care,” he says. “It’s hard to explain why, it just
  feels very different.” Perhaps it feels different because Andersson’s Fifa
  pack habit started as a child – without his own disposable income, he asked
  for Fifa coins every Christmas for nine years. A number of children’s toys are
  now sold via a mystery mechanism: LOL Surprise! dolls, Mini Brands, and
  endless Disney figurines and plushies. It’s easy to see how youngsters are
  becoming acclimatised to this type of consumption, which could arguably
  normalise gambling. *** In June, Bethan found herself with no money left for
  gas thanks to her Labubu habit. The 55-year-old – who has just passed the
  California bar exam and asked to use a pseudonym – got hooked on the dolls in
  May. “It became like a game. Some of the time – most of the time – I didn’t
  want the stuff. I just liked the excitement of waiting, finding and obtaining
  them,” she says. Bethan has spent hundreds of dollars on Labubus (and knockoff
  “Lafufus”) in just a few months; while she has been able to pay her bills, she
  has had to borrow money for gas, has no money left for emergencies, and has
  increased her credit card debt. “There are things I didn’t normally have to
  save up for but now I have to,” she says. But Bethan is not just motivated by
  the blind box mechanism – in fact, she has numerous packages sitting unopened
  in her house. She is compelled by a sense of competition; Labubus can sell out
  quickly online, and Bethan prides herself on tracking down sellers to get her
  hands on new releases. “For me, it’s getting them before everybody else … at a
  low price before they go up,” she says. As problematic as these compulsive
  behaviours can be, they could be exacerbated by new ways of shopping. Pop Mart
  runs a number of channels on TikTok where it drops new products in live
  streams, forcing consumers to scramble to add them to their carts. “I
  genuinely spent three weeks every day trying to get one Labubu,” Jess says,
  “I’ll never forget feeling how I felt when I got one.” Another app, Whatnot,
  hosts live stream auctions where people bid on collectibles and other products
  – it’s currently the 15th most popular free iPhone app. Eddie says Whatnot
  exacerbated his problem spending. “The hosts and the chat make these kind of
  shopping events more fun but also parasocial,” he says. “You see other people
  spending even more than you.” Eddie found it hard to keep track of his
  spending inside the app: “I never saw an overall total from a shop until my
  order arrived at my house.” Lee, the marketing expert, says “scarcity
  marketing” like this can be very psychologically compelling. He argues that
  time limits on drops and auctions can create a “fear of missing out”,
  compelling consumers to act impulsively. Defenders of blind boxes note that
  baseball cards have been around for over a century – and millennials bought
  mystery playing cards or stickers as kids. Yet, Lee says, what has changed now
  is the amount of money at stake and how easy it is to spend that money using
  digital platforms. While a pack of Pokémon cards might have cost a few dollars
  in the 1990s, most of the blind boxes offered on Pop Mart’s website range in
  price from $15-$26 – though the most expensive one currently available is
  nearly $300. Bethan says she has “cut back” on blind boxes, but has not
  stopped. Andersson last spent money in Fifa a month before we spoke, while
  Eddie is now trying to stay away from blind boxes. Nguyen has managed to
  recoup her money by reselling her collection online during the peak of Labubu
  popularity, but she still has unpopular ones sitting around that she cannot
  sell. Jess faces similar problems – she has tried to sell some of the Labubu
  figurines she does not like online but has found no one else likes them
  either. “They’re definitely not in as high demand as they were at the start of
  this year.” Jess is now prepared to sell her toys for half of what she paid
  for them. Yet although she now has “quite a large collection of stuff and
  nowhere to put it”, she is still buying more blind boxes. Her ultimate aim is
  to cut down to one box a month. Most of the people I speak to would like to
  see greater regulation of blind boxes, although when I first bring up the
  idea, Jess admits: “My first reaction was: ‘No! Please don’t take these away
  from me.’” But she does believe blind boxes are akin to gambling, so suggests
  there should be “greater warnings about what you could be sucked into”. “I
  definitely convinced myself at the start that it wasn’t something that could
  could hurt me, because of the nature of collecting cute things,” she says.
  “But it’s very underhanded, how it can affect you without you realizing.”
