  At this weekend’s state conference, Queensland Liberal National party members
  will debate banning gender-affirming care for children, repealing a ban on
  conversion practices and adopting a policy “whereby batteries, solar panels
  and wind turbines should no longer be deemed as renewables”. Seven separate
  motions reference “gender ideology”, gender-affirming care or transgender
  people, but the word “abortion” does not appear on the agenda for the LNP’s
  first convention since winning last year’s state election. Last October, party
  leader David Crisafulli became just the second modern Liberal elected as
  premier of Queensland to last longer than a week. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email He used last year’s convention to announce his election-winning “adult
  crime, adult time” slogan. It became the centrepiece of the party’s
  small-target law and order strategy; the party has since legislated to
  sentence children as adults for 33 offences, in violation of the state’s Human
  Rights Act. Since winning he has urged the party to maintain a moderate face,
  and to steer clear of controversial social issues such as abortion, which was
  perceived to have hurt the party during the campaign. Last December,
  Crisafulli’s government passed a motion banning debate about abortion in
  parliament for four years. “We don’t exist for culture wars,” Crisafulli told
  the LNP state council last year. But many of the issues for debate brought to
  the convention by party units – effectively, ordinary members – reflect
  current battles within the culture wars. The party branch in Lytton has
  proposed that the convention call on the state government to “ban all gender
  surgeries and chemical drug treatments for persons under 18 years of age
  across all private and public hospitals”. The LNP’s women’s branch will also
  sponsor a motion along similar lines, calling on the state government to ban
  transgender people from using bathrooms corresponding to the gender they
  identify with, with an exception for children. The LNP health minister and
  former leader, Tim Nicholls, announced a ban on transgender children receiving
  gender-affirming care in public hospitals in January. The party’s Metro South
  region, representing southern Brisbane, will propose that the party ought to
  repeal elements of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 2020, a law which bans
  conversion practices. The branch claims it criminalises a medical practitioner
  “if they seek to identify or treat the underlying reasons for a child
  presenting with gender confusion”. The same branch will also propose that the
  party adopt a policy to “retire” anti-discrimination laws passed last year
  under Labor. Labor had been considering banning religious schools from
  homophobic or other forms of discrimination at the time. Implementation of the
  laws was indefinitely paused by the attorney general, Deb Frecklington, in
  March. It says that retiring the bill would “provide clarity for faith-based
  institutions to operate and recruit staff according to their values”. Metro
  South will also propose calling on the state government to welcome back health
  workers sacked for refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic. It
  will also argue for a motion calling on the state and federal party “to adopt
  a policy whereby batteries, solar panels and wind turbines should no longer be
  deemed as renewables”. The party passed legislation this year which green
  groups say restricts approvals of wind projects such that some coalmines have
  an easier approvals pathway. The bill also exempts Olympics venues from
  planning rules. LNP Women also proposed a policy of introducing a 50% target
  of male primary school teachers by 2035. The party has repeatedly refused to
  adopt a gender target akin to Labor’s for its elected ranks on the basis that
  it opposes quotas on principle. The convention is made up of ordinary members
  of the party, organised within party units such as the Young LNP, state
  electorate councils and federal divisional councils. It will be held from
  Friday to Sunday in south Brisbane. Motions passed are not binding on MPs or
  the government but determine general policy and indicate the feeling of the
  party’s base. The federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, will make a speech on
  Friday. Crisafulli and the Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, will both
  make reports, as will the federal Nationals leader, David Littleproud. The
  party president, Lawrence Springborg – himself a former state MP and
  opposition leader – will step down at the conference.
