  Jeremy Corbyn will open a two-day public tribunal into alleged British
  complicity in Israeli war crimes in Gaza on Thursday, at which former
  diplomats, UN specialists and international law academics will examine the
  Foreign Office’s handling of the crisis. The tribunal is being jointly chaired
  by the former Labour leader and is the kind of political initiative that will
  be a thorn in Keir Starmer’s side as his party seeks to retain the backing of
  leftwing and Muslim voters at the next election. The tribunal, which will be
  livestreamed from London, has been framed to look at what has happened in Gaza
  over the past two years, Britain’s legal responsibilities, any evidence of
  British covert support for Israel, and whether the government’s actions match
  any legal obligations to prevent a genocide. A former Foreign Office
  whistleblower, Mark Smith, will give evidence, as well as the UN special
  rapporteur on human rights in the occupied territories, Francesca Albanese.
  Other witnesses will be a lawyer for the family of Jim Henderson, a World Food
  Kitchen aid worker killed on 1 April 2024; Prof Nick Maynard, an Oxford
  University surgeon who has been given a humanitarian award for his work in
  Gaza; and Palestinian journalists including Abubaker Abed and Yousef Alhelou.
  An Israeli historian, Dr Raz Segal, has been asked to explain why many
  scholars regard Israel’s handling of Gaza and the West Bank as “a textbook
  case of genocide”, a view he took in late 2023. UK ministers have defended
  their stance on Gaza, saying they rapidly imposed a ban on all arms sales to
  Israel, except for F-35 parts that were sold on to Israel, suspended talks on
  a new partnership agreement and imposed sanctions on two ministers in Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s government. One of the points of the inquiry will be the degree to
  which RAF surveillance planes have slipped from looking for hostages held by
  Hamas into aiding the wider Israeli military campaign inside Gaza. It may also
  look at the intersection between the Ministry of Defence and the Israeli arms
  industry. Separately, Dr Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian mission to
  the UK, speaking at the Chatham House thinktank on Tuesday, said a de facto
  annexation of the West Bank was happening and the UK should ban the import of
  all products from illegal settlements in Palestine. He said a long list of
  settler products being imported into the UK had been provided to the Foreign
  Office. “Be real, don’t be half-committed and don’t zigzag and dance around
  the issues. Illegalities must be marked,” he said. Zomlot also called for UK
  visa waivers to be withdrawn from Israeli settlers living illegally in the
  West Bank and any UK dual citizens serving in the Israeli army. He welcomed
  the UK steps taken so far but described “most of them as half measures not
  designed to create real leverage”. He said: “The UK had a legal obligation to
  stop the genocide in Gaza, to stop the annexation and to recognise the state
  of Palestine.” The UK plans to recognise a Palestinian state at a UN
  conference in New York on 22 September. Along with Corbyn, the Gaza tribunal
  is chaired by Neve Gordon, a professor of human rights law at Queen Mary
  University of London and vice-president of the British Society for Middle East
  Studies, and Dr Shahd Hammouri, a lecturer in international law at Kent
  University. Tribunal organisers say they hope their unofficial and necessarily
  limited inquiry will stir public demands for an official state-funded inquiry
  into the British government’s handling of the Gaza crisis under Labour and the
  Conservatives. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has described the
  west’s handling of the Gaza crisis as the darkest moment in diplomacy in the
  21st century, but there is little UK government appetite to review the lessons
  of that failure.
