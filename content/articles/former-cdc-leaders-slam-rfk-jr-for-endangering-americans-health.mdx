  Nine former officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have
  said that Robert F Kennedy Jr’s leadership of the US health and human services
  department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and
  “unacceptable”. They also warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every
  American, regardless of political leanings”. In a guest essay for the New York
  Times, the former CDC leaders said Kennedy’s actions were “unlike anything we
  have ever seen at the agency”. The letter comes days after Kennedy sought to
  dismiss Susan Monarez, the CDC director he appointed just months earlier.
  Monarez refused to leave her post, and was later fired by Donald Trump.
  Monarez said through lawyers the clash came after she refused to sign off on
  Kennedy’s directives. In the essay, titled We Ran the C.D.C.: Kennedy Is
  Endangering Every American’s Health, the former leaders, including Rochelle P
  Walensky, Mandy Cohen and Tom Frieden, said they were concerned Kennedy is
  “focusing “on unproven ‘treatments’ while downplaying vaccines” and cancelling
  medical research “that will leave us ill prepared for future health
  emergencies”. The former officials accused Kennedy of replacing “experts on
  federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his
  dangerous and unscientific views”. The letter comes as the Trump
  administration is pushing back on criticism of Kennedy’s leadership. The White
  House said last week that Trump and Kennedy aim to make the agency “more
  public-facing” and “more accountable,” and that they would be “strengthening
  our public health system and restoring it to its core mission of protecting
  Americans from communicable diseases, investing in innovation to prevent,
  detect and respond to future threats”. The arguments over the direction of the
  CDC center in part on disagreements over vaccination policies. Monarez was
  reportedly fired after clashing with Kennedy over vaccine policy. In a sign
  that it is a debate even Trump can’t escape, the president on Monday in a
  Truth Social post called on pharmaceutical companies to “justify” the success
  of the Covid vaccines that were initiated during his first term. “Many people
  think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree! With
  CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it
  NOW.” Trump added that while the drug companies “go off to the next ‘hunt’ and
  let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC”, they
  should “figure out the success or failure” of Covid drugs. The White Househas
  named deputy health secretary Jim O’Neill to serve as acting CDC director.
  O’Neill is a biotech investor and former speechwriter for the health
  department during the George W Bush administration. He can only serve as an
  interim leader of the agency until a permanent director is confirmed by the
  Senate. Following Monarez’s firing, hundreds of CDC staffers rallied outside
  the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta in protest. Three senior CDC leaders,
  Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel Jernigan, resigned from their
  posts. In Monday’s Times editorial, the nine former CDC officials stepped in
  to Covid vaccine dispute, saying Operation Warp Speed “produced highly
  effective and safe vaccines that saved millions of lives” during the pandemic.
  “During our respective CDC tenures, we did not always agree with our leaders,
  but they never gave us reason to doubt that they would rely on data-driven
  insights for our protection, or that they would support public health
  workers,” they added.
