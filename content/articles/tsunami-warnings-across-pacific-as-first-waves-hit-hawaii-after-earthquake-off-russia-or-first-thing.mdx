  Good morning. One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded triggered a
  series of tsunami warnings and evacuation orders stretching across Japan, the
  US west coast and much of the Pacific, with reports of waves up to 4 meters
  high in some remote regions of eastern Russia. The 8.8-magnitude earthquake
  struck at a depth of 19.3km (12 miles) and was centred 126km (80 miles)
  south-east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city along Russia’s Avacha Bay, the
  US Geological Survey said. Initial reports suggested damage was most
  significant in Russia, where a tsunami with a height of 3 to 4 meters was
  recorded along parts of the shore. What was the damage in the US? Smaller
  surges hit Hawaii, although a major, destructive tsunami was not expected and
  no damage was recorded. Hours later, parts of the US west coast were being hit
  by waves. What have people been told to do? Officials said residents should
  stay away from the water, saying the first waves were not necessarily the most
  powerful. This is a developing story. Follow live updates here. UK to
  recognize state of Palestine in September unless Israel holds to a ceasefire
  The UK will formally recognize the state of Palestine this September as a
  result of the “increasingly intolerable” situation on the ground in Gaza,
  unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution in the
  Middle East. Keir Starmer’s cabinet has agreed a roadmap for peace in the
  region after coming under intense domestic pressure over the mounting
  humanitarian crisis in the territory, and calls to follow France in
  acknowledging statehood. The prime minister recalled his cabinet from its
  summer break to approve the plan after holding talks with Donald Trump in
  Scotland. The US president said the issue had not come up but that he did “not
  mind” the UK taking a position, even if he would not. The Israel prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, posted on X that Starmer had rewarded “Hamas’s
  monstrous terrorism”. What will recognizing Palestine mean? It is in effect a
  formal, political acknowledgment of Palestinian self-determination – without
  the need to engage in thorny practicalities such as the location of its
  borders or capital city. Read our explainer here. What else is happening? A
  group of high-profile Israeli public figures, including academics, artists and
  public intellectuals, have called for the international community to impose
  “crippling sanctions” on Israel amid mounting horror over its starvation of
  Gaza. US placed on rights watchlist over health of its civil society under
  Trump A group of global civil society organizations have placed the US on a
  watchlist for urgent concern over the health of its civic society, alongside
  Turkey, Serbia, El Salvador, Indonesia and Kenya. A report released by the
  non-profit Civicus placed the US on its watchlist after “sustained attacks on
  civic freedoms” across the country, according to the group. What did Civicus
  say about the US? “[It] appears to be sliding deeper into the quicksands of
  authoritarianism. Peaceful protests are confronted with military force,
  critics are treated as criminals, journalists are targeted, and support for
  civil society and international cooperation have been cut back,” Mandeep
  Tiwana, Civicus’s secretary general, said in a statement. In other news …
  Donald Trump suggested yesterday that Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender,
  “stole” Virginia Giuffre and other young female staffers by hiring them away
  from the US president’s Mar-a-Lago country club. The Senate yesterday
  confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for Trump, to a lifetime seat
  on a federal appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated
  for ignoring court orders. Trump shortened his deadline for Russia to end its
  invasion of Ukraine to 10 days. The president told reporters he had not heard
  from Vladimir Putin, adding: “It’s a shame.” Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te,
  will delay an expected trip to allies in Latin America due to domestic issues,
  amid reports the US opposed a stopover in New York. Stat of the day: UCLA
  agrees to $6.5m settlement with Jewish students over pro-Palestinian protests
  The University of California, Los Angeles, will pay nearly $6.5m to settle a
  lawsuit by Jewish students and a professor who said the university allowed
  antisemitic discrimination to take place on campus during last year’s
  pro-Palestinian protests. The protests attracted national attention after
  counter-protesters staged a violent attack on pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
  UCLA also faces a lawsuit from more than 30 pro-Palestinian protesters. Don’t
  miss this: We face daunting global challenges. Here are eight reasons to be
  hopeful The world is an awful place in many ways, and the crises we face are
  daunting, writes John D Boswell. Looking past the dark headlines, however,
  there are profound reasons to be optimistic for our future: we are actually
  making incredible progress on global poverty, health, longevity and climate
  change. … or this: Brain injuries and legal battles – the NFL’s persistent
  problem with CTE Though the motive for Monday’s evening’s shooting at the NFL
  headquarters remains unclear, police found a note in which the shooter railed
  against the NFL and blamed football for giving him CTE, an incurable brain
  illness. Whatever the truth, his note is sure to reopen the existential debate
  that has followed the sport for decades. Climate check: Trump administration
  moves to scrap climate rule tying greenhouse gases to public health harm Lee
  Zeldin, Trump’s director of the Environmental Protection Agency, yesterday
  proposed revoking a scientific declaration that has long been the central
  basis for US action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight the climate
  crisis. The “endangerment finding” is the legal underpinning of a host of
  climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants
  and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. Last Thing: Salvador

  $26,000-$40,000 A painting bought for £150 ($200) at a house clearance auction
  in the UK has been identified as a work by Salvador Dalí and is now valued at
