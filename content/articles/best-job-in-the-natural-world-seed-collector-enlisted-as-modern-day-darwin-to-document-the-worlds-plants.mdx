  It was described as “the best job in the natural world”: an expedition
  botanist for Cambridge University Botanic Garden who would follow in the
  footsteps of Charles Darwin and go on plant-collecting adventures around the
  world. Within days of the job advertisement going viral, six people had sent
  it to Matthew Jeffery and suggested he apply. “I was already working as a tree
  seed collector for the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew Gardens, collecting native
  trees from across the UK, and I’d done a lot of European plant exploring –
  particularly of alpine plants – on holidays with friends,” says Jeffery, 31,
  who has degrees in biology and plant taxonomy and had worked in horticulture
  at Chelsea Physic Garden and Kew. After realising he had the right skills for
  the unique role, which involves organising and leading international
  expeditions to collect and observe wild plants and seeds, he decided to apply.
  “Every job I’ve done has been a dream job for me – I’ve been very lucky – but
  this job has an incredible potential to work in diverse places and with
  diverse plants,” he says. “It was too good an opportunity to pass up.” Jeffery
  was appointed in March: it is believed to be the first time a British botanic
  garden has hired an expedition botanist in modern history. “It’s very
  daunting,” he says – but also inspiring. “I learn a lot more from talking to
  people from different places about local plants and their uses than I could
  ever learn from reading about them in a book. Different cultural viewpoints
  and histories can also completely change how you perceive something, and add
  value and insight, so when you come back to the UK, you have a totally
  different outlook on how you would grow these plants, treat them or even think
  about them.” Like Darwin, he is excited about exploring the world and hopes to
  make discoveries with the help of the expert botanists he will encounter. “It
  would be really cool to find a new species,” he says. “Obviously, the people
  from the country we’re working in would be best placed to find that, but just
  to be there when it happens.” In preparation for his first trip, Jeffery was
  given advanced wilderness medical training on how to survive and deliver first
  aid in a remote environment. “Most of the risks and dangers of the expeditions
  are the same as they would be in the UK, because there are very few places
  left in the world that are really extreme and remote – but I might be going to
  some of those places,” he says. Jeffery recently returned from his first
  expedition to Croatia where he and his colleague, Andrea Topalovic Arthan,
  worked with botanists from the University of Zagreb to collect seeds and
  record data about plants in wet grasslands. “This is a habitat under threat
  because of land use change and increasing drought levels,” he says. Seeds they
  brought home included Eriophorum latifolium, a cottongrass that is rare in
  Croatia but grows well in the UK. On Plješevica mountain, they also collected
  data about populations of alpine and subalpine plants, including high-altitude
  saxifraga and bellflowers known as Edraianthus, taking samples to press and
  dry for the herbarium in Cambridge. Working alongside local botanists on such
  expeditions means seeds and knowledge are shared across international borders,
  helping to ensure rare and threatened plant populations can be protected and
  boosted in a plant’s country of origin, as well as in Cambridge, Jeffery says.
  After an expedition to South Africa this summer, he is planning to collect
  more wild seeds from Croatia in September. These will be brought home to
  Cambridge to diversify the botanic garden’s living collection and aid
  scientific research and conservation. “What’s so interesting about Croatia is
  the environmental gradient across the country: the coast has a dry
  Mediterranean climate and as you go inland it becomes much more temperate and
  continental European,” he says. At the border between the two climates, plants
  that like cooler, wetter conditions grow next to Mediterranean plants that
  prefer dry heat. “And the species overlap quite considerably – so the plants
  growing at those borders potentially have the capacity to deal with both
  climates to some degree. They are more adaptable than usual, one way or the
  other.” Within the space of a few metres, the habitat and species composition
  of the plants change completely. “That shows they are very adapted to their
  specific niche. But it also shows how under threat they could be – how easily
  you could lose that whole population if the environment changes slightly.” It
  was while he was in the isolated grasslands with his Croatian colleagues,
  observing the plants, that the unique set of challenges an expedition botanist
  must face hit home for the first time. “There was a mother bear with her cub
  in the area and we were warned she was very aggressive.” Their only means of
  defence, he says, was to make as much noise as possible “so the bear would be
  aware we were there” and avoid them. As the light started to fade, Jeffery’s
  Croatian colleague Katarina Husnjak Malovec came up with a novel solution:
  loudly playing a mixture of Croatian music and 80s and 90s hits from her
  phone. “We now have a bear deterrent soundtrack,” he says. Find more age of
  extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston
