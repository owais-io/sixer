  One mark of whether someone has the boldness to be a good pop star is how they
  respond to overhearing someone slagging them off. A few weeks ago, the
  Icelandic-Chinese jazz-pop phenomenon Laufey was at a coffee shop close to her
  Los Angeles home when her ears pricked up at the mention of her name (it’s
  pronounced “Lay-vay”, by the way). “I used to love her,” a young woman told
  her friends. “I’ve met her and she’s so sweet, but her music is unlistenable
  now.” In that split-second, Laufey realised that she could do the Normal
  Person Thing (slink away unnoticed and furiously text her group chat), or do
  the Pop Star Thing. She spun around to face the group. “I’m so sorry,” Laufey
  said, her voice dripping with honeyed sarcasm. “I try my best.” The thought of
  being confronted by a celebrity you are gossiping about is enough to send most
  of us into an early grave, and I nervously laugh as Laufey tells me the story
  one morning in New York. She laughs too, perhaps a little shocked by her
  ballsiness. “I wasn’t even trying to clap back,” she says. “They didn’t know
  what to say, they were so dumbfounded.” This goes against much of what I
  thought I knew about Laufey. The 26-year-old has drawn an obsessive fanbase
  for winsome love songs that marry her jazz and classical training with sticky
  pop hooks. Her music is a giddy tumble into a retro-modern world of soft teen
  romance, with aurora skies, sunset kisses and crushes who leave you on “read”.
  It surges with the big feelings of modern young womanhood, swaddling them in
  tulle and sending them airborne amid cascading orchestration. Over the peppy
  bossa nova of her breakout, TikTok-buoyed hit From the Start, she comes across
  as an Austen heroine who speaks internet, tortured by the “burning pain” of
  listening to a crush “blah blah blah”-ing interminably about a new partner.
  Her fans, often young women, are drawn into Laufey-land by her big-sister
  energy: an edition of her 2023 album Bewitched came with a themed board game.
  At first glance, with her retro jazz-influenced sound, you might not peg
  Laufey as the most likely superstar, one who has racked up nearly 5bn Spotify
  streams and a string of sellout shows across the world. But you could also see
  her music as a lighter and more literal take on the vintage-hued introspection
  that has made Lana Del Rey and Billie Eilish stadium-fillers around the globe.
  Now Laufey is keen to rough up her reputation as gen-Z’s favourite jazz
  savant, at least a little. Her new album A Matter of Time splits the
  difference between sugar-plum symphonics with imperfect notes and vocals that
  crack with emotion. One song has jolting strings that she compares to a
  scream. “I wanted to make more of a statement on this album,” she says. “I’ve
  become known as a bit of a soft singer. I am that, but I also want to show
  parts of myself that aren’t that pretty.” She arrived in the hotel lobby this
  morning on time and as neat as a pin, with a cardigan-wearing bunny rabbit
  dangling from her handbag. (The critter, named Mei Mei, is Laufey’s mascot and
  alias of sorts – she releases alternative versions of her songs under its
  name, and it is also available to buy, with a portion of the proceeds aiding
  music education as part of the Laufey Foundation.) “Do you want to go in
  there?” she asks, leading me into a side room and getting out the best
  biscuits: “It’s the guests-only lounge.” The place is done up like a hunting
  lodge, with artfully oxidised mirrors, a wall-mounted antelope head and, most
  bizarrely, given that it is summer, a burning log fire. When I comment on the
  strangeness, Laufey says, wryly: “Well, it’s now reached a very cool 24
  degrees.” After beating Bruce Springsteen to take home the 2024 Grammy award
  for best traditional pop vocal album, Laufey’s career has gone into overdrive.
  She’s now a fashion week fixture, trading air kisses with Naomi Campbell on
  the front row of the Chanel show in July, and has celebrity pals in Olivia
  Rodrigo, Chappell Roan, PinkPantheress and the indie sensation Clairo, whom
  she recently challenged to a spicy chicken wing-eating contest on a Hot Ones
  episode. She has won over industry legends: earlier this year, she duetted
  with Barbra Streisand on a heartfelt cover of her song Letter to My 13 Year
  Old Self. “It’s beautiful to see a young artist inspired by jazz greats like
  Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday make such a deep connection with her fans,”
  said Streisand. This autumn, Laufey will embark on her first arena tour, with
  two nights at Madison Square Garden. She says she was driven by a “hunger” to
  imbue the new experiences of a whirlwind few years into her new album. It
  radiates a sense of adventure, dovetailing between twangy campfire country to
  swoony ballads and sherbert-spiked pop. The record is produced by Laufey and
  longtime collaborator Spencer Stewart: between them, they can play just about
  any instrument you have heard of, as well as some you may not have. I was
  unfamiliar with the celesta, an obscure kind of idiophone that Stewart and
  Laufey play on the record (it sounds like a child’s musical jewellery box). On
  the Busby Berkeley-worthy confection Lover Girl, she knowingly leans into her
  Cupid-struck image, while on Carousel, Laufey reckons with inviting a partner
  into her circus-like life while a seasick accordion plays. The rapturous
  Forget-Me-Not, recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (for which she was
  a teenage cello soloist), is her most accomplished work of composition to
  date; her voice soars among flurries of flutes. “I wanted the album to reflect
  all sides of my emotional scale,” she says, huddling in air-con that has
  apparently been set to “Himalayan”. “Within one day, I will have a happy hour
  and a crying hour. I have no interest in making an album that’s one vibe
  throughout.” But there is, she says, an emotional through-line about learning
  to accept yourself while falling in love with someone else. She won’t talk
  about her relationship status today though, and I ask if internet scrutiny
  makes it hard to write candidly about her dating experiences. “There’s always
  a line of ambiguity,” Laufey says, before smiling mischievously. “But if you
  get into a situation with me, you kind of know that I might write about it.”
  There’s a playful looseness to Laufey that suggests she has settled into her
  success. She says that hasn’t always been easy. After her Grammy win, she
  struggled to balance the new attention with a punishing touring schedule. “I
  was a little bit scared,” she says. “I had a more shocking kind of success
  than I thought I would ever have. With the flurry of it all, it got a bit hard
  for me to keep up mentally.” It wasn’t just the shows; it was that being a pop
  star means being a piñata for online opinion. “It was the battle of seeing a
  bad photo of yourself online, or hearing bad comments about yourself,” she
  says. “It was tough.” Laufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir always knew what it meant to
  work. She was born in Reykjavík to a mother who is a professional violinist
  for the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, with maternal grandparents who are music
  professors. Aged four, Laufey began piano lessons, then added cello lessons at
  eight, cramming schoolwork around a dizzying schedule of rehearsals and
  performances. She credits that relentless regimen with giving her the strength
  – vocal, mental and muscular – to play for extended periods. When we meet,
  she’s in the middle of a six-date summer run of orchestral shows across the
  eastern United States. After an early brush with the spotlight as a finalist
  in Ísland (Iceland) Got Talent in 2014, Laufey won a scholarship to the
  prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston, and began posting performances
  of jazz standards from her dorm room. In 2021, she released her debut EP,
  Typical of Me, which drew from the music of 20th-century Tin Pan Alley and
  found fans in Billie Eilish and Willow Smith. A Matter of Time marks her
  creative world opening up. Two spry new songs were created with Taylor Swift
  collaborator and the National founder member Aaron Dessner at his Long Pond
  Studios, in an experience that Laufey says “opened a third musical eye”. And
  she is more lighthearted than ever on Mr Eclectic, a bossa nova-inspired track
  featuring Clairo that pokes fun at men who mansplain classical music to her.
  “I just think it’s funny to be the type of man who performatively reads a
  beaten-up paperback outside a coffee shop,” she says, her nose wrinkling.
  “I’ve dated guys like that, but this is a forever type of man. Why do you
  think all philosophers are men? They just had the platform and the audacity.”
  Laufey’s spicy side makes me like her a whole lot more, not least because it
  feels refreshing after years of interviewing media-trained artists who won’t
  tell you their favourite colour in case it conflicts with their Dulux brand
  deal. That candour can also be seen in A Matter of Time’s waltzing Snow White,
  which addresses what she calls her lifelong struggle with body image and
  identity. In the video, set amid the jaw-dropping Icelandic tundra, she sings,
  “I don’t think I’m pretty, it’s not up for debate,” into a mirror while
  pulling at the side of her left eye to emphasise its shape. Today, she feels
  that her insecurity about her looks is as under control as anyone’s. (“We all
  have our moments,” she says.) She enjoys fashion, and attended the Met Gala
  last year wearing a custom veil featuring the notation of a favourite Bach
  classical piece. She can’t remember which violin fugue it was in the moment
  and pulls up the Spotify app on her phone. “It was this,” she says, as a
  delicate composition tinnily plays. “But it’s on guitar for some reason.” That
  won’t do. “Come on, violin!” she whoops, scrolling on. Laufey hopes that
  someone will be doing the same thing with her music a few centuries from now.
  “I think often about how artists in the past were not led by external
  sources,” she says. “Ella Fitzgerald wasn’t putting a 20-second clip of her
  new song out and having people read it to filth. I try so hard to not let
  [social media] shape my art.” I wonder if that’s a challenge, given that
  social media has helped to power her fairytale rise since the very beginning.
  “Honestly” – her voice drops to a whisper – “I love it. I literally have a
  career because an audience on social media showed me there was a space for the
  type of music I make. I know that if I had gone to a label six years ago and
  said: ‘I’m going to make music that’s a mix of jazz and classical and about my
  own experiences, and I’m gonna play arenas one day,’ they would have said,
  ‘Bullshit.’ They would not have put a dollar down on my name. “I don’t know
  what miracle happened that I get to have this career,” she says. She’s
  determined to make every moment of it count. She drains the last of her iced
  coffee and heads off to a fitting for her upcoming tour. After that, she’ll go
  to Electric Lady Studios to work on more music – no matter that her new album
  isn’t even out on the day we speak. She jumps into a car with blacked-out
  windows, nattering away to her assistant in Icelandic. I can’t understand what
  she is saying, but it sounds like Laufey is planning her next move. A Matter
  of Time is out now.
