  Into a Finnish labyrinth One of the most magical places I’ve been is Lake
  Saimaa in eastern Finland – a huge labyrinth of islands and tranquil forests
  where you don’t come across many people. We rented a lakeside cabin (typically
  they cost from about €100 a night, sleeping two) and watched the midnight sun
  shimmer across peaceful waters. Days were spent kayaking between uninhabited
  islets or hiking pine-scented trails, with only the call of black-throated
  divers (or loons) for company. We visited the Linnansaari national park on an
  archipelago in the middle of the vast lake (the largest in Finland and fourth
  largest freshwater lake in Europe), where encounters with rare Saimaa ringed
  seals await. It’s nature’s embrace at its purest – remote, quiet and utterly
  rejuvenating. Anthony Canyons and forests in Montenegro Last autumn, I visited
  Durmitor national park in northern Montenegro, a quiet and beautiful place in
  the Dinaric Alps. The road there passed through thick pine forests and opened
  on to wide valleys surrounded by tall, rocky mountains. I walked to the Black
  Lake (Crno Jezero), where the water was so still it perfectly reflected the
  autumn colours of the trees. In the hills, shepherds looked after their sheep,
  and small villages sold fresh cheese and honey. I also gazed down into Tara
  River Canyon, which is among Europe’s deepest gorges; right at the bottom,
  several thousand feet below me, I could see the bright turquoise ribbon of the
  river. Lorna Walkden Cycling through the Bosnian countryside My partner and I
  cycled the Ćiro trail in Bosnia Herzegovina. We picked up the trail in Ivanica
  and followed it for more than 80 miles to Mostar. It follows the route of the
  Dubrovnik to Mostar railway line, which closed in the 1970s, and has a lot of
  spooky, bat-filled tunnels. We barely met another person on the route. One
  night we camped overnight in a pub beer garden because we were worried about
  mines. Stunning scenery, spooky history, and we saw tortoises on the trail.
  Anna Fenton Pyrenean hideaway, Spain If there was ever a jaw-dropping way to
  enter Spain it has to be over the peaks of the Pyrenees to the village of
  Ochagavía in Navarre. Nestled in the valley of Salazar, its cobbled streets
  and whitewashed homes are surrounded by rivers, forests and peaks where
  walkers mingle with birds of prey, chamois, marmots and an occasional hermit.
  When civilisation and replenishment are needed, Sidrería Kixkia, a restaurant
  in Ochagavía, will fill your very grateful tank with local cider and a very
  meaty menu. Liz Owen Hernandez Remote islands off northern Germany We stayed
  at the charming seaside resort of Cuxhaven in Germany and took the horse-drawn
  carriage over mud flats to visit the tidal island Neuwerk with its
  extraordinary 700-year-old lighthouse. I’d also recommend a ferry trip beyond
  Neuwerk to incredible Heligoland island to see the 47-metre-high Lange Anna
  sea stack and the large gannet colony. You can see the craters left by the
  British in 1947 when the occupying authorities decided to blow up the
  remaining German military installations on the island in one giant explosion,
  having already bombed the island severely in 1945. Yet the tiny island with
  its red cliffs and grassy plateau survived somehow, and is now home to more
  than 1,000 people. Sue Kyson Kayaking between icebergs, Iceland Starting in
  Reykjavík, with my 15-year-old, I took a rental car for a road trip, staying
  in small hotels and hostels on the way. We went kayaking between icebergs in
  the Jökulsárlón lagoon, snowmobiling and ice-climbing on the Sólheimajökull
  glacier and whale-watching near Húsavík. We were amazed to see the molten lava
  on the Reykjanes peninsula, as well as the interactive volcano museum near
  Vik. Highlights for my teen included taking a ferry to the island of Grímsey
  to snorkel with puffins while they were diving for fish. Karen Guenzl
  Brittany’s quiet side Tucked away in western Morbihan, an hour from Vannes and
  the Breton coast, Inguiniel is a quiet corner of Brittany, where rolling hills
  and forests invite you to slow down. We stayed at picture-perfect Camping Pont
  Calleck, which was ideal as a walking and cycling base. From there we cycled
  to Le Faouët, a town with a pretty square, a 16th-century market hall, and
  striking gothic chapels. As evening fell, our ride took us along the River
  Scorff past weirs and watermills and eventually to a quiet auberge for a
  traditional Breton meal. Kevin Atkins Winning tip: bathed in constant
  daylight, Norway’s Svalbard The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (which used
  to be called Spitzbergen) in summer is bathed in constant daylight because it
  is entirely within the Arctic Circle. Dog sledding on wheels is a great way to
  experience this remote landscape, guiding your teams of eager huskies over the
  tundra, past mountains necklaced with puffy Arctic cottongrass flowers. Boat
  trips, passing near the town of Barentsburg, the inhabitants of which are
  mostly Russian, allow closeup views of slumbering walruses, minke whales and
  dozens of seals. Nearby, huge cliffs at Alkhornet are the breeding ground for
  thousands of birds, and below the nests, arctic foxes wait patiently for their
  next meal. Afterwards, rent a floating sauna cabin, leaping into the sea to
  cool off. Caroline
