  Children under 15 years old made up almost a third of outpatients treated for
  wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Gaza last
  year, statistics published in The Lancet reveal. The figures were released by
  MSF in correspondence with the respected medical journal and come from six
  health facilities in Gaza supported by the international medical NGO. The
  facilities are predominantly in the south and centre of the devastated
  territory. More than 90,000 outpatient consultations involving wounds were
  carried out at the facilities in 2024. Bombs, shelling or shooting was
  involved in just under half of these, MSF said. The death toll in the Israeli
  offensive launched following the Hamas raid into Israel in October 2023 has
  risen to over 62,000, according to the ministry of health in Gaza which is
  used by much of the UN, and which the British government says is a “reasonable
  figure”. Of these, more than half are women or children. The proportion could
  be higher. Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database
  indicate five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have
  been civilians, the Guardian revealed last week. Israeli officials say they
  take all “feasible” precautions to avoid civilian casualties and accuse Hamas
  of using civilians as human shields. On Monday, Israel twice struck Nasser
  hospital, the last functioning public hospital in southern Gaza, killing 20
  people, among them five journalists. Witnesses said the second strike came
  just as media and rescue crews arrived 15 minutes after the first bombing.
  Statistics of wounded during the Israeli offensive have received less
  attention. More than 150,000 have been injured, according to the Gaza health
  authorities. “Explosive weapons are designed to be used in open battlefields,
  but are increasingly being used in urban areas,” MSF said. “The makeshift
  shelters in which people live following frequent displacement offer almost no
  protection against explosive weapons, and especially their secondary effects
  such as blast, shrapnel, and incendiary impact.” In two MSF hospitals, nearly
  60% of lower-limb wounds were related to explosive weapons, often with open
  injuries to bone, muscle, or skin, the organisation noted. MSF said: “Most
  immediate fatalities occur at the scene of impact and thus are not captured in
  our data. Under-reporting of both injuries and deaths could be prevalent in
  vulnerable populations who are often not able to move away from sites of
  impact such as infants, children, people with disabilities, and older adults.”
  The harsh conditions of life in Gaza, where much of the population live in
  makeshift tents and basic infrastructure such as sanitation systems or roads
  has been destroyed, contribute to the burden on the few functioning health
  facilities in the territory. Just over half the wound care-related conditions
  recorded by MSF were injuries due to unsafe living conditions, domestic
  accidents, and road accidents. MSF said it was facing critical shortages of
  essential supplies and was rationing food for patients being cared for in its
  facilities to only one or two meals daily. “It is likely we will not be able
  to offer any food for our patients in the coming weeks. MSF reiterates our
  call for an immediate and standing ceasefire ... We urge the Israeli
  government to directly allow and protect impartial and unrestricted medical
  aid into Gaza,” the organisation said. Israeli authorities said they
  facilitate the entry of medical supplies to Gaza. Earlier this month a
  spokesperson for COGAT, the ministry of defence agency responsible for
  administering Israeli restrictions, told the Guardian that, since the
  beginning of the war, more than 45,000 tons of medical equipment have been
  transferred to the Gaza Strip by 3,000 trucks. UN agencies and doctors who
  have worked in Gaza have said that there is a critical shortage of medical
  supplies, which NGO Physicians for Human Rights have attributed to the
  “limited and delayed flow of humanitarian aid permitted by Israeli
  authorities”. The Hamas attack into Israel which triggered the conflict killed
  1,200, mostly civilians. About 250 people were abducted.
