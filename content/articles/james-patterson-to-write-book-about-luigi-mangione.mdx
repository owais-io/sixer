  Bestselling crime writer James Patterson and investigative journalist Vicky
  Ward are writing a book on the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson,
  while actor Dave Franco said this week that he would be “open” to playing
  accused murderer Luigi Mangione in a biopic if one were to be made. Mangione
  is currently awaiting trial for the murder of Thompson, who was shot and
  killed in Manhattan on 4 December last year. “This is a story about the
  American Dream Gone Wrong,” said Patterson in a statement on the book, which
  does not yet have a title or release date. “It’s also a story of one young
  man’s descent from Ivy League graduate to notorious accused killer to
  so-called political martyr.” Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to federal
  charges of murder, using a weapon with a silencer, and two counts of stalking.
  The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said earlier this year that she had
  directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty. “Like millions around
  the world, Vicky and I were riveted by coverage of the five-day manhunt from
  Midtown Manhattan to Altoona, Pennsylvania,” Patterson said. Mangione was
  eventually arrested in a McDonald’s. “This story touches all of us,” said
  Ward. “It goes to the heart of the social, cultural and political issues
  dividing the US right now. Nothing is more of a reviled black box than the
  health insurance industry, and it’s time to open it up, through a crime that
  has caught the attention of the country.” The book will be published by
  Little, Brown in the US, which also published The Idaho Four, Patterson and
  Ward’s recent book on the murder of four students. The news comes in the same
  week that Franco said he would be open to playing Mangione in a biopic when
  asked on the talkshow Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Tuesday. “No
  one has approached me about it yet, I’ll say that … More people in my life
  reached out about this exact thing than anything else that has ever happened.
  Let’s just say I am open if it’s the right people, and let’s leave it at
  that.” After the shooting, Mangione gained an avalanche of support on social
  media. The online fandom has sparked criticism for glorifying an alleged
  murderer. “The suspect, who police now believe to be Mangione, was a fit young
  man and I think it’d be mistaken to overlook the degree that likely propelled
  the story,” Jared Holt, a senior research analyst at the Institute for
  Strategic Dialogue, told the Guardian in December. “The other feature of
  Mangione is one that plays an outsized role in every single point of American
  life: his race,” wrote Ben Makuch in the Guardian at the time. “If he were
  Black or Latino, this story would likely have played out very differently.”
