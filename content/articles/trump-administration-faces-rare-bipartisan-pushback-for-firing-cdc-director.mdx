  The Trump administration is facing rare bipartisan pushback for firing the
  director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amid turmoil
  at the US’ top infectious disease agency that prompted dozens of staff to walk
  out of its headquarters in protest on Thursday. The White House has said Susan
  Monarez, who was confirmed as director of the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention just a month ago, was fired as she was “not aligned with the
  president’s agenda” – only for Monarez to refuse to depart. The official’s
  lawyers have said that, as a Senate-confirmed appointee, only Donald Trump
  himself can remove her. Monarez was reportedly fired by Robert F Kennedy Jr,
  the US health secretary, for refusing to remove agency officials and
  committing to restricting proven vaccines. Kennedy, who previously founded an
  anti-vaccine group, has long spread misinformation about immunizations and
  this week placed new restrictions on who can get Covid vaccines. This stance,
  along with concerns about budget cuts and political interference to the work
  of the CDC, prompted the resignation of four top agency leaders. On Thursday,
  dozens of CDC staff walked out of their Atlanta headquarters in support of
  Monarez and the other departed leaders. The extraordinary turmoil at the CDC
  has provoked bipartisan alarm in Congress, earning the Trump administration a
  rare rebuke from normally slavishly loyal Republicans. “She’s been on the job
  for only three weeks and I am very concerned and alarmed by this removal,”
  Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, said of Monarez. Collins
  said there was “no basis” to remove the CDC director. Bill Cassidy, another
  Republican senator who chairs the senate health committee, said that an
  upcoming meeting of the Department of Health and Human Services committee that
  advises on vaccine use should be postponed due to the attacks upon the CDC.
  “If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as
  lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current
  turmoil in CDC leadership,” Cassidy said, adding that “serious allegations”
  have been made about the lack of scientific process in vaccine
  recommendations. Bernie Sanders, the independent senator, said that people of
  all political persuasions should be alarmed by the attempt to restrict access
  to vaccines, which he called “one of the greatest public health achievements
  of the 20th century”. “We are witnessing a full-blown war on science, on
  public health, and on truth itself,” Sanders said. “In just six months,
  Secretary Kennedy has dismantled the vaccine review process, narrowed access
  to life-saving Covid vaccines and filled scientific advisory boards with
  conspiracy theorists and ideologues.” The Trump administration shows no sign
  of backing down, however. In a press briefing on Thursday, Karoline Leavitt,
  the White House press secretary, criticized one of the departing CDC officials
  for using the term “pregnant people” in his resignation letter. “I understand
  there were a few other individuals who resigned after the firing of Ms
  Monarez,” she said. “One of those individuals wrote in his departure statement
  that he identifies pregnant women as pregnant people, so that’s not someone we
  want in this administration anyway.” The official, Demetre Daskalakis,
  resigned from his position as director of the National Center for Immunization
  and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC on Wednesday, accusing the administration
  of using the agency to “generate policies and materials that do not reflect
  scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the
  public’s health”. Daskalakis responded to Leavitt’s remarks in an interview on
  CNN. “I find it outrageous that this administration is trying to erase
  transgender people,” he said. “I very specifically used the term pregnant
  people, and very specifically added my pronouns at the end of my resignation
  letter to make the point that I am defying this terrible strategy at trying to
  erase people and not allowing them to express their identities. “So I accept
  the note from the press secretary and I counter that with: I don’t care.”
