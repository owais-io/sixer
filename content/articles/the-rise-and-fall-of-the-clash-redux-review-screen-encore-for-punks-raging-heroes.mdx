  The Rise and Fall of the Clash Redux review – screen encore for punk’s raging
  heroes
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-07T06:00:26Z'
bodyText: >-
  Here’s a downbeat, slightly miserable documentary about the Clash, a “redux”
  in fact by director Danny Garcia of his 2012 film The Rise and Fall of the
  Clash. Perhaps that earlier version had more to say about how the Clash came
  raging out of London’s punk scene in the 1970s; this one only really gets
  going in 1982 when Joe Strummer boots drummer Topper Headon out of the band
  for heroin addiction, then a year later kicks out guitarist Mick Jones. Rise
  and Fall Redux is a portrait of the band as a sinking ship, finally disbanding
  in 1986. It is a film groaning with talking heads. Pick of them is Viv
  Albertine of the Slits who sums the Clash up nicely when she says: “They were
  best when they were small and angry … when they were hard and angry and poor.”
  Others indulge in a bit intellectual waffle. The only member of the classic
  lineup to appear is guitarist Mick Jones, not taking it too seriously. Asked
  about the secret of the band’s success, he grins slyly: “It was a mix of luck
  and fortunate timing.” There are interviews too with the disgruntled drummers
  and guitarists hired in later years to replace Headon and Jones, poorly paid
  and seemingly badly treated by the band’s svengali-like manager Bernard
  Rhodes. In the end this a film for Clash fans, with little in the way of
  explainers; there’s not much, for example, about where the band came from or
  what it was like in the early days. There’s no recap of the stories about how
  Strummer met Jones and bassist Paul Simonon in a London dole queue, or how
  they were so frequently spat at on stage that in 1978 Joe Strummer contracted
  hepatitis from an audience member. It would benefit from a little more of the
  glory days, a little rise with the fall. • The Rise and Fall of the Clash
  Redux is in UK cinemas from 8 August.
