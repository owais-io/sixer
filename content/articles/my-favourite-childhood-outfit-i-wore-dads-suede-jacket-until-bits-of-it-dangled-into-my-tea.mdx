  My favourite childhood outfit: ‘I wore Dad’s suede jacket until bits of it
  dangled into my tea’

  I loved Dad’s old suede jacket. He’d had it for as long as I could remember,
  an artefact from his more rock’n’roll days, and it had been worn into buttery
  softness. When the lining finally disintegrated, and the suede thinned to
  imminent oblivion, he decided to retire it. But I couldn’t bear to see it go.
  I tried it on and felt great – like a chip off the old block. It wasn’t at all
  heavy and the softness extended to the buttons that were covered in matching
  suede material. Sure, it had a patina of London grime and smelled of Old
  Holborn tobacco, but I thought it was cool. I was about 13 and couldn’t afford
  to buy a suede jacket in a million years, so I claimed it as my own, and set
  about bringing it back to life, like the singing mending mice in Bagpuss. Mum
  and I picked out some blue fabric, which was incongruously bright, in
  hindsight. After she relined the jacket for me (a woman of many talents, she
  papered that wall behind me in the picture, too) it felt as good as new, if
  not better. What had been part of my dad’s identity became mine and I wore it
  until sections of suede had broken free and started dangling skankily into my
  tea – at which point it was unquestionably deceased. I had a habit of nicking
  Dad’s clothes, and they often became some of my favourite adolescent looks.
  The threadbare checked shirt I used as a nightshirt (and decorated by sewing
  tiny novelty buttons all over it – toadstools, pineapples and what-have-you);
  the suit jacket I took when I got a bit older, and wore as a coat (it wasn’t
  very warm, but who cares when you’re a teenager?); the pleated, heavy-wool
  kilt from when he was a small boy that I wore as a miniskirt. I was a big fan
  of badges and a Playboy bunny one was my favourite at the time. With its
  combination of cute rabbit and the naughty, sexy, adult world it signified –
  plus the sense that I was being subversive by wearing it – that bunny caught
  my imagination as womanhood loomed The hat must be mentioned, too. Everyone
  was wearing bowler hats or wide-brimmed variations in the 80s – Bananarama,
  Debbie Gibson, Madonna – but my hat inspiration came from the 1985 cover of
  Face magazine with Felix Howard who, at 13, had starred in Madonna’s Open Your
  Heart video. For this iconic shot, he was styled in a black felt hat with a
  strip of newsprint reading “Killer” tucked into the ribbon. Also of note: the
  Chinese lucky dolls I’d hung from the top button of the jacket. These were
  from one of my all-time favourite childhood shops, the late Neal Street East
  emporium in London’s Covent Garden. It was full of treasures from China, Japan
  and beyond – and had a “basement bazaar” of thrillingly affordable nicknacks,
  such as the fan you can just about see on the wall behind me in the hat
  picture. It was a magical place and everything I ever bought there felt
  magical, too.
