  Morning everyone. Scientists have denounced a claim by Adani that its exports
  of coal from Australia are helping advance sustainable development. In other
  news, Anthony Albanese is fighting off pressure from his backbenchers to take
  a tougher line on Israel, religious schools in New South Wales are growing
  fast, tsunami warnings have been downgraded in large parts of the Pacific, and
  the 10 Australian poetry collections you can’t miss. Australia Class divide |
  Enrolments in religious schools have increased by a record 30% in NSW in the
  past decade, new data shows – and not necessarily correlating with student
  beliefs. Independent schools in general have enrolled almost two-thirds of the
  state’s additional students since 2000. Rates hope | Yesterday’s low inflation
  figures have raised hope for an interest rates cut – indeed they show a cut is
  overdue, our regular columnist Greg Jericho points out. But slow growth is not
  all good news, our economics editor writes. ‘Wilful disinformation’ | An Adani
  claim that its Australian export program, whereby coal is sent through the
  Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, is advancing the United Nations’
  sustainable development goals has been denounced by leading scientists. Car
  claims | Car companies continue to sell vehicles that use much more petrol and
  emit more toxic fumes than advertised, despite repeated investigations
  identifying discrepancies in marketing, an AAA report claims. Mushroom order |
  A court order has been placed on Erin Patterson’s house preventing it from
  being sold in case compensation claims are made against her for killing three
  members of her family with a deadly mushroom lunch. World Tsunami downgrade |
  A major tsunami is not expected to strike Hawaii after the first waves hit the
  islands after a powerful magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s eastern
  coast, one of the strongest ever recorded. However, authorities ordered
  evacuations on Ecuador and Chile’s Pacific islands. Follow developments live.
  Exclusive | A former CIA officer who helped lead the intelligence assessments
  over alleged Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election has said
  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is ignorant of the
  practices of espionage after she accused Barack Obama and his national
  security team of “treasonous conspiracy” against Donald Trump. Migration boom
  | The population of England and Wales has grown by 700,000 – the
  second-largest annual increase in more than 75 years – largely due to
  international migration. ‘Moral failure’ | A British-Israeli woman who was
  held hostage by Hamas for more than 15 months has accused Keir Starmer of
  “moral failure” after he set the UK on course to recognise a Palestinian
  state. It comes as aid workers in Gaza said Israel’s new measures to improve
  the humanitarian situation fall short of what is needed. Climber dies | Laura
  Dahlmeier, a German double Olympic biathlon champion, has died days after she
  was seriously injured by a rockfall while climbing in the Karakoram in
  Pakistan. Full Story Why do we age in dramatic bursts, and what can we do
  about it? Ian Sample hears from Prof Michael Snyder about his study of ageing
  and how it might be a series of episodes rather than a linear process.
  In-depth Two decades ago, a historian warned Brisbane would become the first
  200km city as it sprawled from Noosa to the NSW border. As the state
  government eschews putting more townhouses and apartments in existing city
  areas, Andrew Messenger reports on how the dire warning looks like coming
  true. Not the news Australian poetry is having a moment and to mark Australian
  Poetry Month the artistic directors of Red Room Poetry share a list of
  unmissable titles. From Ali Cobby Eckermann to Luke Davies, and from Nam Le to
  Judith Wright, there’s something for seasoned readers and newcomers alike.
  Sport Swimming | Mollie O’Callaghan carried on where she left off in the
  Olympics by winning the 200m freestyle at the world championships in Singapore
  on a night of mixed fortunes for Australia’s team. Cricket | Ben Stokes has
  been ruled out of the final Test match of England’s series against India
  starting at the Oval later today with a grade-three muscle tear in his
  shoulder. Media roundup The Age reports that Victoria has kept its AA credit
  rating despite the budget blowout from the suburban rail loop project. Weather
  experts think they might have found a new weapon to tackle the threat of
  another algal bloom in South Australia, the Advertiser reports. A prominent
  Gold Coast developer has died suddenly aged 39 while exercising at a gym, the
  Bulletin reports. What’s happening today Courts | Judgment expected at the
  federal court in X’s case against the eSafety commissioner. Economy | RBA
  deputy governor Andrew House speaks at the Barrenjoey Economic Forum in Sydney
  at 9.20am. Art | Archibald Prize people’s choice winner announced at 11am.
