  Johnny Vegas: Art, ADHD and Me 9pm, Channel 4 Johnny Vegas (and his
  “longsuffering personal assistant” Bev) is hugely endearing in this two-parter
  following his public art project. The comedian graduated from art college 25
  years ago and is committed to making a sculpture that gives something back to
  his beloved home town of St Helens – a welcome departure from other recent
  celebrity art exhibitions. His journey was filmed over four years; along the
  way, we see him navigate a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity
  disorder. Hollie Richardson MasterChef 8pm, BBC One The BBC has made the
  surprising decision to air the new series of the long-running cooking
  competition, despite the judges Gregg Wallace and John Torode having been
  sacked. Fans and contestants – although not Sarah Shafi, who has been edited
  out after telling the show’s producers she did not want it to be broadcast –
  may argue that their enjoyment shouldn’t be ruined because of the action
  taken. HR Destination X 9pm, BBC One Rob Brydon’s competition blindfolds
  contestants, sends them on a bus around Europe and asks them to guess where
  they are at the end of each episode. With so many red herrings and impossibly
  hard clues, applying logic feels futile. Still, it’s weirdly addictive. HR The
  Moors Murders: A Search for Justice 9pm, BBC Two Nearly 60 years have passed
  since Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were tried and convicted, but the remains of
  a 12-year-old victim, Keith Bennett, are yet to be found. The second episode
  of this documentary continues to analyse new evidence and leads in the hope of
  finally bringing the case to a close. Ellen E Jones The Fortune Hotel 9pm,
  ITV1 If Jet2 holidays did The Traitors … Stephen Mangan returns as a trickster
  Caribbean hotel manager who gives each team of two guests a suitcase – most of
  them empty, one with an “early checkout card” in it and another holding a
  £250,000 prize. Before they start guessing and swapping, they need to get into
  the hotel – but there isn’t room for everyone. HR Air India Crash: What Went
  Wrong? 10pm, Channel 4 A quick turnaround enables this documentary to assess,
  two months on, why a London-bound Air India jet hit buildings in Ahmedabad
  just after takeoff, killing 260 people. Experts sift through theories
  involving pilot error and failures of software and electrical systems. Jack
  Seale Live sport The Hundred cricket: Manchester Originals v Southern Brave
  3pm, Sky Sports Main Event. The women’s game is followed by the men’s at 6pm.
