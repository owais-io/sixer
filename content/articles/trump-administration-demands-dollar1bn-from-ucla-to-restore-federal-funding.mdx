  The Trump administration is seeking a $1bn settlement from the University of
  California, Los Angeles, a White House official said on Friday. The person was
  not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of
  anonymity. The Trump administration has suspended $584m in federal research
  funding from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health,
  the Department of Energy and other agencies, the university’s chancellor,
  Julio Frenk, said in a message to UCLA staff and students this week. Last
  week, the justice department notified the university that an investigation by
  the department’s civil right division had “concluded that UCLA’s response to
  the protest encampment on its campus in the spring of 2024 was deliberately
  indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students” in
  violation of federal anti-discrimination law. “This disgusting breach of civil
  rights against students will not stand: DOJ will force UCLA to pay a heavy
  price for putting Jewish Americans at risk and continue our ongoing
  investigations into other campuses in the UC system”, the US attorney general,
  Pam Bondi, said in a statement. UCLA is the first public university whose
  federal grants have been targeted by the administration over allegations of
  civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The
  Trump administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar
  allegations against private colleges. The new University of California
  president, James B Milliken, who oversees a university system of 10 campuses,
  six academic health centers and three affiliated national laboratories,
  confirmed on Friday that the university had received notice from the justice
  department and was reviewing it. “Earlier this week, we offered to engage in
  good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its
  critical research mission,” Milliken said. “As a public university, we are
  stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely
  devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict
  great harm on our students and all Californians. “Americans across this great
  nation rely on the vital work of UCLA and the UC system for technologies and
  medical therapies that save lives, grow the US economy, and protect our
  national security,” he added. UCLA recently reached a $6m settlement with
  three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued the university, arguing
  it violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters in 2024
  to block their access to classes and other areas on campus. The university has
  said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to
  implement recommendations. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, expressed
  outrage at the proposal he attributed directly to the president. “He has
  threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine unless we do his
  bidding,” Newsom said at a news conference with Texas lawmakers in Sacramento
  on Friday. “We will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic
  freedom on this extraordinary public institution. We are not like some of
  those other institutions that have followed a different path,” Newsom added,
  apparently referring to two private universities, Columbia and Brown, which
  have agreed to pay large settlements to resolve investigations by the Trump
  administration in recent weeks. California Senator Scott Wiener echoed that
  language, writing on Instagram: “In another mob boss fascist move, Trump is
  now trying to extort UCLA for $1B, force it to adopt his racist, transphobic,
  xenophobic policies &amp; accept a monitor to control the university. Hard no.
  UCLA is a California public university subject to California law &amp; built
  on California values. The answer is no.”
