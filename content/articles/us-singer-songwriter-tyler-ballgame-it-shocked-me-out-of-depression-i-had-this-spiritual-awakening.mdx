  US singer-songwriter Tyler Ballgame: ‘It shocked me out of depression. I had
  this spiritual awakening’

  Four years ago, Tyler Perry’s stepfather offered him a job in the office of
  his dog-training company in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Perry had little else to
  fill his time: he was 29 and living in his mother’s basement, uncertain what
  he should do with the rest of his life. In 2017, he had left Berklee College
  of Music, where he had ostensibly studied songwriting, but largely smoked weed
  and skipped class. The songs he wrote then were introspective and folk-driven,
  in the lineage of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith – artists he had been drawn to
  in his senior year of high school, who had spoken to him just as depression
  had first set in. “I was depressed for, like, 10 years,” he says. In idle
  moments in the office, he would scour Craigslist, imagining a different life
  in New York or Nashville or LA. One day, on a whim, he applied for a
  recruitment job at a commercial real estate company in Los Angeles. He lied
  about his experience, and the fact he didn’t have a degree. “I just wrote a
  really good email,” he says. “And 20 minutes later they called me. I went
  through two interviews in a day, and then they said: ‘Can you be here in two
  weeks?’” Perry had never been to Los Angeles. That evening, he talked it over
  with his family and friends. “And my mom said: ‘What do you have to lose? A
  few thousand dollars? You can always come back.’ So I moved to Venice Beach,
  California.” In a clip of Perry that began to circulate online last autumn,
  the singer was filmed at Eagle Rock bar The Fable performing Help Me Out – a
  song that longs for self-acceptance the way one might yearn for a lover. He
  moves around the stage with a sensuous majesty, a large man in triple denim,
  flicking his hair, courting the mic stand, his voice moving effortlessly from
  earth-deep to celestial. There is something of Elvis and Roy Orbison and Harry
  Nilsson; the kind of easy, confident performance that feels like alchemy. In
  person, Perry is a faintly beatific presence, sitting in a Brighton cafe in
  the gap between shows at the city’s Great Escape festival. He speaks gently,
  his conversation ranging from the suburbs of Rhode Island to the free kombucha
  at WeWork via countercultural philosopher Alan Watts’s thoughts on ego. What
  quickly becomes clear is the distance between the solid assurance of Perry’s
  stage self and the more tentative man sitting across the table. Before all of
  this – before the dog-training office and the real estate application – Perry
  had begun working with a counsellor and dietician named Courtney Huard. For a
  couple of years the pair worked on improving Perry’s sense of body positivity
  and mental health, and the impact was immense. “She was an incredible person
  and I’m really lucky I came across her,” Perry says. Around the same time, he
  discovered the work of self-help teacher Eckhart Tolle and his book The Power
  of Now, and took an Enneagram personality test. “I pinned my personality to a
  wall, and I got to see it for the first time,” he says. “And it shocked me out
  of depression. I had this kind of spiritual awakening.” The problem was that
  this newly awakened Perry did not fit quite so well with his catalogue of
  melancholy folk songs. For years, when he played live, he had hidden behind
  his guitar, his voice flat and whispered. “I was wanting to be ‘cool’ in that
  sense of ‘mystical, can’t grasp it …’” he says. “But I don’t think that’s
  necessarily me.” In California, he lived out of a suitcase, worked for the
  property company in the day, and at night played open mics across the city.
  Mostly he would play a couple of his own folk songs, and then a cover of Roy
  Orbison’s Crying. It was this last song that hit the sweet spot. “People would
  freak out, and it would be like it was my birthday,” he says. “Everybody in
  the place looking at me and clapping.” He realised that covering Orbison’s
  song called on the skills he had first learned doing musical theatre in high
  school: a supported singing voice, a sense of generosity and occasion. Perry
  wondered if this might be a new direction for him – one that drew on all of
  his musical loves, from showtunes to Fleet Foxes, via Jonathan Richman and the
  Who’s 1969 rock opera, Tommy. He dreamed up a character for himself, called it
  Tyler Ballgame – a nod to the nickname of legendary Boston Red Sox baseball
  player, Ted Williams, and a joking put-down to himself, a man who had spent
  years squandering his talent in his mother’s basement, being the very opposite
  of a sporting legend. He set about working out how this Tyler Ballgame might
  write and perform. At Berklee, Perry had attended a performance studies class
  taught by Livingston Taylor (brother of singer-songwriter James Taylor). The
  classes were held in a theatre, and on the first day, Taylor invited each of
  his 40 students to stand on the stage. You had to go up and hold your palms
  out to the audience, and shift your weight from one foot to the other in time,
  and look everybody in the eye. It struck Perry as brilliant. In Los Angeles,
  Perry remembered the class, and it struck him as an act of radical presence;
  something Tyler Ballgame might do. He started to try it in his live shows.
  “I’d reach out to the audience and look them in the eye. Like, we’re both here
  to do something. I’m trying to connect, and we’re going to live this
  experience together.” The songs came with an ease. Soulful, and sad sometimes,
  but also brimming with something hopeful and alive. They carried the richness
  and simplicity of the classics. Perry relocated to East Los Angeles, began
  collaborating with other neighbouring musicians, and playing live as much as
  he could. One day, the producer Jonathan Rado, famed for his work with Miley
  Cyrus and the Killers, happened to see an Instagram story of a Tyler Ballgame
  show and contacted him. The singer went over to Rado’s studio shortly
  afterwards and over the next couple of weeks, the pair recorded more than an
  album’s worth of material. Word of Tyler Ballgame soon spread, and by last
  autumn, record labels had begun making fevered bids to sign him. In the end,
  Perry went with the British independent Rough Trade, connecting with them over
  a shared love of Nick Drake and Arthur Russell. “I had a lot of options and it
  was really flattering and really crazy,” he says, “but I just kept coming back
  to Rough Trade, because of that kindred spirit of whatever music I make
  naturally, in my soul, they already love, because they’ve already put out all
  the music that I love.” Perry makes for easy company, and after an hour and a
  half of conversation I ask if there is anything else he might like to tell me.
  “I don’t know,” he says slowly, and hesitates. “Maybe I’d like to mention my
  counsellor, Courtney, again,” he says. “She had her life taken, really
  horrifically.” Huard was killed by her husband, who later killed himself.
  Perry learned of her death when a friend sent him a news article from his
  local newspaper back in Rhode Island. Perry saw the photograph and was
  stunned. At that precise moment he had been writing Help Me Out, a song
  largely inspired by Huard. “She made me realise your value is not tied to the
  size of your body, or how people look at you – things which had kept me from
  even being on stage at all. “There are so many people on the messageboards of
  her funeral posts and her obituary saying: ‘She set me on the course of my
  life.’ She was a really special person, and it just shows how precious life
  is. So I live for her.” It is a hot afternoon, but Perry takes to the stage at
  the UnBarred Brewery wearing a woollen jumper. He looks out to the crowd,
  gently spreads his palms, and begins to sing. It is a golden performance, the
  songs sounding almost as if they have always existed, and Perry entirely
  mesmerising. As he plays, I think of something he told me over lunch – about
  the freedom and fluidity of performance. “I want to be totally in the flow
  state, like gone,” he said. “Where nothing is canned or prepared or
  contrived.” Some shows, he told me, you get it, and the rest of the band get
  it, and the audience gets it, too. “And then it’s like real magic. It’s a
  celebration of the joy of performance and the joy of music.” Today as Perry
  and the band play, the air is filled with a kind of joy – with something like
  real magic in the warmth of a Sussex afternoon. Tyler Ballgame’s new single
  New Car is out now. He plays the End of the Road festival, nr Blandford Forum,
  30 August, and The Lexington, London, 10 September.
