  Good afternoon. The former Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has posed
  alongside Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin at a military parade in Beijing’s
  Tiananmen Square to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world
  war. Andrews, the most senior Australian at the event, stood several rows
  behind the North Korean dictator, who is facing complaints of alleged crimes
  against humanity. The presidents of Russia and China, Vladimir Putin and Xi
  Jinping, appear alongside Kim in the front row, with the leaders of Iran,
  Indonesia and several other countries also in the group photo. The Victorian
  MP Vicki Ward said Andrews had attended as a “private individual”, while the
  opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said Andrews needed to explain his presence and
  “what that actually tells the world”. The former federal foreign affairs
  minister and New South Wales premier Bob Carr is also in Beijing, but
  reportedly did not attend the military parade. Top news Australian Greens
