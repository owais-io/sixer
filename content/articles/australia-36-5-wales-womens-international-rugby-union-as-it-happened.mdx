  The rain is coming down again here in Sydney and many fans are heading across
  the road to the famous Percy’s at the North Sydney Hotel to warm up with a tot
  of whiskey or a pint of Guinness. Time for me to join them, me thinks. Thanks
  for your company tonight and stay tuned for a match report. Tune into this
  same bat channel tomorrow for the Guardian’s live coverage of the third Test
  between the Wallabies and the British &amp; Irish Lions in Sydney from 7pm
  AEST. The Welsh will be happy with a 1-1 series. They arrived on these shores
  at the No 10 ranked team in the world and a young and radically revamped side
  sprang an almighty upset on the Wallaroos in Brisbane to run out deserving
  21-12 winners. Normal service has resumed in Sydney but the Welsh can go to
  the World Cup with plenty of hope. A huge crowd has stayed behind after the
  siren here at North Sydney Oval as the Wallaroos celebrate with family,
  friends and fans. This is not only a great victory party but also a farewell
  for the Rugby World Cup campaign that kicks off on August 23. Great win for
  the Wallaroos. They were disappointed by their performance last week and knew
  they needed to deliver this week. A six tries-to-one victory will please them
  no end and give Jo Yapp’s side a much-needed injection of confidence ahead of
  their Rugby World Cup opener v Samoa in three weeks time. 80th minute:
  Marsters is over! Or is she? The gold maul looked to have planted their
  veteran over the line but the officials have seen something to say otherwise.
  No try! That’s a shame Australia have been denied 40-points, but 36-5 will
  have to suffice. 79th minute: Australia aren’t done yet. Wales are wilting
  fast in the slush and the Wallaroos charge back within the enemy 22. We have
  word that Australia’s No 8 Tabua Tuinakauvadra has earned player of the match
  honours for her titanic two-try performance. As the second tick down,
  Australia drive for the corner in a rolling maul. It wheels left and right.
  Desiree Miller flies in to put her shoulder to the wheel. They’re over the
  line. Can they land it? 77th minute: Great try from the most-capped Wallaroo
  of all time. Wales were brave but they were weary and the big Wallaroo veteran
  simply couldn’t be denied. Desiree Miller lines up the kick as the rain
  returns. She aims for the famous Moreton Bay fig at the north end but misses
  to the left. 76th minute: Piper Duck gets within a metre of the line but is
  dragged down into the mud. How are Wales hanging on here? Australia win a
  penalty. Do they turn the screws and take the penalty. No way. They want
  another try. Sure enough, a fast lineout and Ash Marsters breaks away and
  crosses to score! 74th minute: Australia win a scrum despite a mighty drive
  from the Wales pack. Halse quickly goes wide but the pass is long but way too
  high for her winger to reel in. It’s Wales lineout but Australia spoil.
  They’re back in possession, grinding towards a sixth try. Wales build the wall
  and absorb the charge of the gold forwards. Wallaroos go wide and Hinds has a
  snipe herself but can’t split the line. 71st minute: Great run by Caitlyn
  Halse! The Australian fullback cut through and made 30-metres in quicktime.
  Swamped, she tries a kick for Desi Miller but muffs the contact and Miller
  makes the tackle, driving her opposite number through the mud into the corner.
  The Welsh come to the rescue but too late. 68th minute: Now Australia are back
  on the attack. Wales look weary now but grimly they hang on. Kate Williams
  leads the rearguard, rushing up and jolting the ball loose. Good hit and it
  wins the visitors a brief reprieve. Bridie O’Gormon and Samantha Wood are
  leaving the field after sterling shifts in the gold jersey tonight. 67th
  minute: Wales finally get a chance to counter but Waiaria Ellis makes a
  brilliant covering tackle to haul down Carys Phillips on the 22. Australia
  attack the ruck but go off their feet. Penalty Wales. They try a lineout and
  win it. Now they spin it but a high pass results in a knock-on. Ref calls it
  as backwards and Wales go to the corner. They maul within 10-metres but a low
  ball from the scrumbase is spilled. Australia swoop on the crumbs and clear it
  to Caitlyn Halse who reefs it long. 50-22? Yes! 64th minute: Wood chips it
  over the Welsh line to pin them yet again. Australia have Tia Hinds on the
  field now for Moleka. There’s another kick for the corner by Halse and she
  chases her dribbling grubber into the in-goal. It gets away but she gets a
  finger on it and raises her arm to appeal to the ref. No dice, Caitlyn. That’s
  a Halse alarm. No try. 60th minute: Here comes another gold wave. Ash Marsters
  goes up the middle then Samantha Wood has a dip. Australia are inside the
  Welsh 22 and now they go wide where Waiaria Ellis gets it within 10-metres of
  the line. They move back to the middle but cough it up. What can Wales muster?
  Not much. They lose the turnover ball in heavy contact. That was O’Gormon who
  jarred it loose. 56th minute: This is starting to get nasty for Wales. It’s
  been all Australia since the second quarter of this match. Lydia Kavoa comes
  on for the Wallaroos. Piper Duck greets her with gusto. This is shaping as a
  great night for Australia’s women’s side. Strewth! Australia shoved Wales
  right off the ball in that scrum and almost won it against the feed. They’re
  celebrating but no, Wales get the whistle. “Driving up” is the call from the
  ref. Tuinakauvadra has a double! The Wallaroos had the Welsh pinned on their
  line and sure enough they went fast and short to their big No 8 and she
  crashed over in the corner. Again Wood’s radar deserts her on the conversion
  and the kick sails wide. 5oth minute: We have a hardy crowd of 4561 crammed
  into this grand old gladiatorial arena and they are loving what they’re seeing
  from the Australians on the verge of their World Cup campaign later this
  month. There’s a little TMO delay here as they look at a deliberate knockdown
  from the Welsh. Sure enough Pyrs has been handed a yellow card and is off.
  Meanwhile, Australia have huddled up and look to be plotting a move… 48th
  minute: Desiree Miller is away down the sideline! She swerves one, bumps
  another , then fends a third before finally loosing a pass to Moleka but it
  goes to ground on the next offload. Thrilling run by the pig-tailed speedster
  from Sydney’s eastern suburbs! Great try by Tabua Tuinakauvadra after her
  fellow forwards laid the platform. Even in the clutches of two Welsh defenders
  she couldn’t be stopped. Try in the cormer and it’s too tight and angle for
  Wood’s boot as the conversion is unsuccessful. 45th minute: O’Gormon and
  Pohiva thunder into contact for the Wallaroos. Ouch! Berthan Lewis reels out
  of the tackle. The Welsh are holding on but the gold chargers keep coming. How
  long can the visitors hang on here? Uh-oh, here comes the powerful Australian
  No 8 at speed. Tabua Tuinakauvadra is over! 42nd minute: We have word that
  Alex Callender won’t return to action after going down injured in the second
  minute of this Test. No word yet on the seriousness of the injury but fingers
  will be crossed across the nation the Wallaroos co-captain will still be able
  to make the flight to London next week. Meanwhile, Australia pick up where
  they left off, Desiree Miller and Georgia Friedrichs winning a turnover on
  halfway. Notch one up to the pocket rockets! This sets the home side up
  nicely… The rain has stopped. Will the Wallaroos? Here we go with the second
  half… After their shocker last week, Australia has rebounded brilliantly
  tonight. Despite a traditional Welsh welcome of driving rain and slush
  underfoot, the Wallaroos held their feet – and their nerve. All the early
  pressure was delivered by the Welsh but possession didn’t become points.
  Instead the gold wall held fast, repelling raid after raid (despite also
  gifting the Welsh penalties). When finally they found themselves in the
  visitor’s half, the girls in gold made it count. Maya Stewart scored the first
  try out wide but the Welsh quickly responded with a try of their own to
  Jasmine Joyce. That one try apiece parity lasted a slender minute though.
  Australia charged up the middle and Faitala Moleka dummied and ducked over to
  make it 14-5. A try in the shadows to Katalina Amosa just before halftime made
  it 16-point margin and Australia’s game to lose. It’s been a bruising
  encounter so far. Big second half coming up! Katalina Amosa has picked it up
  and touched it down! What a strike before the break. That try, after striong
  mauling and relentless pressure from the Australians, will demoralise the
  Welsh and put real confidence in the home side for a confidence-boosting
  victory before they fly to England for the World Cup. They weathered the early
  storm and then returned the blowtorch with interest, piling on three tries and
  making the most of every opportunity. Wood adds the extras. 40th minute: Wales
  have a scrum on their own line. They win it and Evans scampers a yard or two
  from the s scrum base. But she hits heavy traffic and the Wallaroos win a
  turnover from Samantha Wood who got that familiar black headgear over the ruck
  and her hands on the ball. One last shot for the Wallaroos in this first half…
  38th minute: That was a weird option by the Australians to spurn another try
  when they had Wales rattled. The rain, which is now falling heavily again,
  conspired to make Wood’s penalty kick a damp squib. But the Wallaroos have the
  ball back now and are pounding it one out from the breakdown. They refuse to
  clear to the backline fanned to the left and pay for it as Wales win a
  turnover. 36th minute: Australia are back on top now but Wales have a scrum
  near halfway. They win it and wheel to the right but the Wallaroos have won a
  penalty through Tabua Tuinakauvadra who got a handf on it and won it back. Can
  Australia ram home the advantage with a third try? No they won’t. They’re
  going for the three. But Wood blots her copybook by putting it well short of
  the black dot. Quick reply from the Wallaroos! After a brilliant run from
  Faliki Pohiva they march downfield, commit too many Welsh to the ruck and then
  the Australian flyhalf does it all herself, tapping down close to the posts.
  Another great kick from Samantha Wood extends the lead to nine points Great
  try from Jasmine Joyce in her 50th Test. She had space to work with but two
  Wallaroos swamped her from either aside as she took the ball. But strength and
  experience got her over the line. The kick sails wide… 27th minute: The Welsh
  attack week was a revelation and they’re coming again, defying slippery
  confitions to keep the ball in hand. They go right now and Jasmine Joyce hits
  it at speed… 25th minute: Wales win their lineout with a neat play to the
  front. They rumble within five metres of the line and pound the line. Now they
  feed their backs and Carys Cox dives into contact and is tackled just short.
  The Wallaroos are desperate but they’ve erred again and Wales will go to the
  lineout again from five out. They muff the catch, knocking on under pressure
  from Leonard and Moleka clears to safety 22nd minute: Keira Bevan has knocked
  on at the base of the scrum and she thought she’d got away with it. But
  despiute the onfield ref having her back turned, the touchie has swooped on
  the fumble and Australia win the scrum. Faitala Moleka clears to the 22. 20th
  minute: That try was a great result for Australia after so little possession
  in the first 20 minutes of this game. But the Wallaroos made the most of their
  first foray into Welsh territory and it was the silky skills of Halse and
  Stewart who got them on the scoreboard. Unfortunately they’ve started the
  resumption with an offside play by Emily Chancellor and that gifts Wales the
  ball and puts them back on the attack. That ill-discipline won’t please Jo
  Yapp. Wonderful try for Stewart! She set herself up perfectly in space on the
  right and Halse sent a bullet pass her way and Stewart sped the 15-metres into
  the corner. A lovely kick from the sideline adds the extras in front of the
  famous Ken Irvine scoreboard. 16th minute: Maya Stewart, the Wallaroos highest
  tryscorer, still hasn’t had a touch in her return game. But the veteran has
  got the ball now via a ripped Halse pass to the right and she’s over! 14th
  minute: Australia are spinning it wide, left and right, but there’s no real
  gains. O’Gormon knocks on. But she’s been saved by a penalty against the
  Welsh. Halse will kick this into the corner and the Wallaroos will load up and
  launch an attack on the line. 12th minute: Finally the Wallaroos enter the
  Welsh half and they maul from the 22. They win the lineout and go wide.
  Michaela Leonard makes a half-bust and offloads as Australia close in. But
  they’ve spilt the ball and the Welsh have scopped up the crumbs. 9th minute:
  The Wallaroos are landing some heavy shots in defence but the Welsh are still
  in the red zone. First scrum of the night and the Wallabies have won a penalty
  for driving in. Wallaroos enforcer Bridie O’Gorman won that for the home side
  and her teammates mob her in appreciation. 6th minute: Wales are perched on
  the Wallaroos line. Michaela Leonard hauls down Keira Bevan as Australia hang
  on. Georgia Evans rumbles it within inches of the line. But just as the gold
  jerseys repel another advance and kick it clear, Wales win a penalty. Will
  that pressure turn into points? No, Wales are spurning three to chase five!
  3rd minute: Oh no! Australia’s co-captain Alex Callender is down already.
  Months on She’s lasted just a couple of minutes. Callender is straight off the
  field and down the tunnels. Wales resume on the halfway and they are
  thundering into contact, Keira Bevan and Sisilia Tuipulotu leading the
  charges. They edge the ball up to the 22… 2nd minute: Some areial jousting to
  start as players guage the grip in the grass underfoot. Caitlyn Halse puts it
  high but ate Williams dents the line. Desiree Miller drags her down for the
  home side. Here’s the kick-off… and we have lift-off in the Wallaroos last
  Test before the World Cup later this month. Here come the players. Wales
  running on with heads high after claiming their first away win in 818 days
  last week. Now the Wallaroos… choosing to adopt a saunter. I’m no body
  language expert but that strut reeks of revenge for last week’s shock defeat.
  And now for a rousing Welsh anthem… As the Wallaroos return to the sheds after
  a vigorous warm-up in torrential rain, the skies have momentarily cleared and
  a few stars are poking through. North Sydney Oval is a grand old arena – home
  to the mighty North Sydney Bears in rugby league for 115 years – but the old
  grass is draining nicely with no evident pools on the field of play. Weather
  was a key factor last week in Brisbane with an electrical storm sending the
  players scurrying to the sheds in the first quarter. It proved a crucial
  intervention from on high. The Wallaroos lost all the momentum they’d
  established early while Wales regrouped and came out much stronger after the
  break. There’s a healthy crowd trickling in given the rain bomb that is
  hitting Sydney at the moment, many wearing the red of Wales and the British
  &amp; Irish Lions, of course. We are on Cammeraygal land tonight and a Welcome
  to Country is underway… And here’s how the visitors lineup… WALES (1-15):
  Gwenllian Pyrs, Carys Phillips, Sisilia Tuipulotu, Gwen Crabb, Abbie Fleming,
  Kate Williams (co-c), Bethan Lewis, Alex Callender (co-c), Keira Bevan,
  Kayleigh Powell, Lisa Neumann, Courtney Knight, Carys Cox, Jasmine Joyce, Nel
  Metcalfe. REPLACEMENTS: Molly Reardon, Maisie Davies, Jenni Scoble, Alaw Pyrs,
  Georgia Evans, Meg Davies, Lleucu George, Catherine Richards To continue the
  spirit of revamp, co-captain Kate Williams returns to the side tonight in the
  back-row. Wales have also selected elected to field a brand new front-row with
  Gwenllian Pyrs, Carys Phillips and Sisilia Tuipulotu all starting. There’s
  also a late change as Hannah Dallavalle replaces Lleucu George in the 23. And
  congratulations to Welsh winger Jasmine Joyce who wins her 50th cap tonight.
  WALLAROOS (1-15): Faliki Pohiva, Katalina Amosa, Bridie O’Gorman, Kaitlan
  Leaney, Michaela Leonard, Piper Duck, Emily Chancellor (c), Tabua
  Tuinakauvadra, Samantha Wood, Faitala Moleka, Desiree Miller, Trilleen Pomare,
  Georgina Friedrichs, Maya Stewart, Caitlyn Halse. REPLACEMENTS: Tania Naden,
  Lydia Kavoa, Alapeta Ngauamo, Ashley Fernandez, Ashley Marsters, Layne Morgan,
  Tia Hinds, Waiaria Ellis. The headline inclusion for Australia is winger
  (Wallaroos’ all-time leading try-scorer) Maya Stewart who returns from knee
  surgery in May. Stewart starts on the right wing in one of five changes by
  coach Yapp. Stewart’s return shifts Waiaria Ellis to the bench while Faitala
  Moleka and Samantha Wood form a new-look halves combination, starting at
  flyhalf and scrumhalf respectively. Tia Hinds and Layne Morgan move to the
  reserves alongside last week’s starters Lydia Kavoa and Ashley Marsters, with
  Western Force’s Alapeta Ngauamo also on the pine to replace the injured Eva
  Karpani (back) and Bree-Anna Browne (leg). Former captain Michaela Leonard and
  Piper Duck both come into the starting pack while Faliki Pohiva has overcome a
  hamstring injury and will start in the front row. Wallaroos centre Trilleen
  Pomare will notch her 40th Test cap, becoming the second player to do so in
  history, while captain Emily Chancellor will reach her 30th milestone. Good
  evening and welcome to live coverage of the women’s rugby international
  between Australia and Wales at the beautiful (but very soggy) North Sydney
  Oval. This is the second clash between these sides after Wales got the
  chocolates in game one last Saturday, upsetting the Wallaroos 21-12 in stormy
  Brisbane. That clash was the first ever between these sides on Australian soil
  and the home side were expected to boss the visitors as they had done in seven
  wins across the last eight matches. Since Australia’s 37-5 victory last year,
  the odds against Wales had lengthened even further. Indeed, the tourists went
  into the first Test with a new coach, new captain, three debutants and seven
  players under the age of 21! Yet, after leaking an early try to Annabelle
  Cody, the women in red rallied, going to half-time leading 14-12 after a Nel
  Metcalfe double. Post-oranges they quickly crossed the stripe again through
  Hannah Jones, then bravely held the Wallaroos scoreless for the final 38
  minutes of the game. The result was huge for Wales and a disaster for
  Australia. Jo Yapp’s side take a 2025 win-loss of 2-4 into this game.
  Encouraging victories over the Fijiana and USA in May have since been undone
  by heavy losses to New Zealand (twice) and Canada before last weekend’s
  boilover to a side ranked four slots below them in the world rankings. Since
  the Brisbane boilover Wales have risen from 10th to 9th and Australia have
  slumped from 6th to 8th. So there’s plenty on the line tonight for both sides,
  particularly given this will be the last Test before the Rugby World Cup in
  England. Australia will announce their 32-player squad on 11 August ahead of a
  first pool match against Samoa on August 23. The Wallaroos then face the USA
  in York (Aug 31) before a monster match with England at Brighton on 7
  September. Kick off tonight is 7pm (or 10am BST) and I’ll be back shortly with
  the team lineups.

She had space to work with but two Wallaroos swamped her from either aside as she took the ball. But strength and experience got her over the line. The kick sails wide… 27th minute: The Welsh attack week was a revelation and they’re coming again, defying slippery confitions to keep the ball in hand. They go right now and Jasmine Joyce hits it at speed… 25th minute: Wales win their lineout with a neat play to the front. They rumble within five metres of the line and pound the line. Now they feed their backs and Carys Cox dives into contact and is tackled just short. The Wallaroos are desperate but they’ve erred again and Wales will go to the lineout again from five out. They muff the catch, knocking on under pressure from Leonard and Moleka clears to safety 22nd minute: Keira Bevan has knocked on at the base of the scrum and she thought she’d got away with it. But despiute the onfield ref having her back turned, the touchie has swooped on the fumble and Australia win the scrum. Faitala Moleka clears to the 22. 20th minute: That try was a great result for Australia after so little possession in the first 20 minutes of this game. But the Wallaroos made the most of their first foray into Welsh territory and it was the silky skills of Halse and Stewart who got them on the scoreboard. Unfortunately they’ve started the resumption with an offside play by Emily Chancellor and that gifts Wales the ball and puts them back on the attack. That ill-discipline won’t please Jo Yapp. Wonderful try for Stewart! She set herself up perfectly in space on the right and Halse sent a bullet pass her way and Stewart sped the 15-metres into the corner. A lovely kick from the sideline adds the extras in front of the famous Ken Irvine scoreboard. 16th minute: Maya Stewart, the Wallaroos highest tryscorer, still hasn’t had a touch in her return game. But the veteran has got the ball now via a ripped Halse pass to the right and she’s over! 14th minute: Australia are spinning it wide, left and right, but there’s no real gains. O’Gormon knocks on. But she’s been saved by a penalty against the Welsh. Halse will kick this into the corner and the Wallaroos will load up and launch an attack on the line. 12th minute: Finally the Wallaroos enter the Welsh half and they maul from the 22. They win the lineout and go wide. Michaela Leonard makes a half-bust and offloads as Australia close in. But they’ve spilt the ball and the Welsh have scopped up the crumbs. 9th minute: The Wallaroos are landing some heavy shots in defence but the Welsh are still in the red zone. First scrum of the night and the Wallabies have won a penalty for driving in. Wallaroos enforcer Bridie O’Gorman won that for the home side and her teammates mob her in appreciation. 6th minute: Wales are perched on the Wallaroos line. Michaela Leonard hauls down Keira Bevan as Australia hang on. Georgia Evans rumbles it within inches of the line. But just as the gold jerseys repel another advance and kick it clear, Wales win a penalty. Will that pressure turn into points? No, Wales are spurning three to chase five! 3rd minute: Oh no! Australia’s co-captain Alex Callender is down already. Months on She’s lasted just a couple of minutes. Callender is straight off the field and down the tunnels. Wales resume on the halfway and they are thundering into contact, Keira Bevan and Sisilia Tuipulotu leading the charges. They edge the ball up to the 22… 2nd minute: Some areial jousting to start as players guage the grip in the grass underfoot. Caitlyn Halse puts it high but ate Williams dents the line. Desiree Miller drags her down for the home side. Here’s the kick-off… and we have lift-off in the Wallaroos last Test before the World Cup later this month. Here come the players. Wales running on with heads high after claiming their first away win in 818 days last week. Now the Wallaroos… choosing to adopt a saunter. I’m no body language expert but that strut reeks of revenge for last week’s shock defeat. And now for a rousing Welsh anthem… As the Wallaroos return to the sheds after a vigorous warm-up in torrential rain, the skies have momentarily cleared and a few stars are poking through. North Sydney Oval is a grand old arena – home to the mighty North Sydney Bears in rugby league for 115 years – but the old grass is draining nicely with no evident pools on the field of play. Weather was a key factor last week in Brisbane with an electrical storm sending the players scurrying to the sheds in the first quarter. It proved a crucial intervention from on high. The Wallaroos lost all the momentum they’d established early while Wales regrouped and came out much stronger after the break. There’s a healthy crowd trickling in given the rain bomb that is hitting Sydney at the moment, many wearing the red of Wales and the British &amp; Irish Lions, of course. We are on Cammeraygal land tonight and a Welcome to Country is underway… And here’s how the visitors lineup… WALES (1-15): Gwenllian Pyrs, Carys Phillips, Sisilia Tuipulotu, Gwen Crabb, Abbie Fleming, Kate Williams (co-c), Bethan Lewis, Alex Callender (co-c), Keira Bevan, Kayleigh Powell, Lisa Neumann, Courtney Knight, Carys Cox, Jasmine Joyce, Nel Metcalfe. REPLACEMENTS: Molly Reardon, Maisie Davies, Jenni Scoble, Alaw Pyrs, Georgia Evans, Meg Davies, Lleucu George, Catherine Richards To continue the spirit of revamp, co-captain Kate Williams returns to the side tonight in the back-row. Wales have also selected elected to field a brand new front-row with Gwenllian Pyrs, Carys Phillips and Sisilia Tuipulotu all starting. There’s also a late change as Hannah Dallavalle replaces Lleucu George in the 23. And congratulations to Welsh winger Jasmine Joyce who wins her 50th cap tonight. WALLAROOS (1-15): Faliki Pohiva, Katalina Amosa, Bridie O’Gorman, Kaitlan Leaney, Michaela Leonard, Piper Duck, Emily Chancellor (c), Tabua Tuinakauvadra, Samantha Wood, Faitala Moleka, Desiree Miller, Trilleen Pomare, Georgina Friedrichs, Maya Stewart, Caitlyn Halse. REPLACEMENTS: Tania Naden, Lydia Kavoa, Alapeta Ngauamo, Ashley Fernandez, Ashley Marsters, Layne Morgan, Tia Hinds, Waiaria Ellis. The headline inclusion for Australia is winger (Wallaroos’ all-time leading try-scorer) Maya Stewart who returns from knee surgery in May. Stewart starts on the right wing in one of five changes by coach Yapp. Stewart’s return shifts Waiaria Ellis to the bench while Faitala Moleka and Samantha Wood form a new-look halves combination, starting at flyhalf and scrumhalf respectively. Tia Hinds and Layne Morgan move to the reserves alongside last week’s starters Lydia Kavoa and Ashley Marsters, with Western Force’s Alapeta Ngauamo also on the pine to replace the injured Eva Karpani (back) and Bree-Anna Browne (leg). Former captain Michaela Leonard and Piper Duck both come into the starting pack while Faliki Pohiva has overcome a hamstring injury and will start in the front row. Wallaroos centre Trilleen Pomare will notch her 40th Test cap, becoming the second player to do so in history, while captain Emily Chancellor will reach her 30th milestone. Good evening and welcome to live coverage of the women’s rugby international between Australia and Wales at the beautiful (but very soggy) North Sydney Oval. This is the second clash between these sides after Wales got the chocolates in game one last Saturday, upsetting the Wallaroos 21-12 in stormy Brisbane. That clash was the first ever between these sides on Australian soil and the home side were expected to boss the visitors as they had done in seven wins across the last eight matches. Since Australia’s 37-5 victory last year, the odds against Wales had lengthened even further. Indeed, the tourists went into the first Test with a new coach, new captain, three debutants and seven players under the age of 21! Yet, after leaking an early try to Annabelle Cody, the women in red rallied, going to half-time leading 14-12 after a Nel Metcalfe double. Post-oranges they quickly crossed the stripe again through Hannah Jones, then bravely held the Wallaroos scoreless for the final 38 minutes of the game. The result was huge for Wales and a disaster for Australia. Jo Yapp’s side take a 2025 win-loss of 2-4 into this game. Encouraging victories over the Fijiana and USA in May have since been undone by heavy losses to New Zealand (twice) and Canada before last weekend’s boilover to a side ranked four slots below them in the world rankings. Since the Brisbane boilover Wales have risen from 10th to 9th and Australia have slumped from 6th to 8th. So there’s plenty on the line tonight for both sides, particularly given this will be the last Test before the Rugby World Cup in England. Australia will announce their 32-player squad on 11 August ahead of a first pool match against Samoa on August 23. The Wallaroos then face the USA in York (Aug 31) before a monster match with England at Brighton on 7 September. Kick off tonight is 7pm (or 10am BST) and I’ll be back shortly with the team lineups.
