  As US warships carrying cruise missiles and marines powered towards
  Venezuela’s coastline this week, supporters of the South American country’s
  president, Nicolás Maduro, warned a dastardly imperialist plot for an
  Iraq-style invasion was afoot. “No one will lay their hands on this land!”
  Maduro thundered, calling on patriots to help repel the supposed regime change
  operation by joining his “Bolivarian militia”. Donald Trump’s allies posted
  incendiary social media messages, warning the Venezuelan autocrat the end was
  nigh. “Your days are seriously numbered,” Trump’s former national security
  advisor, Michael Flynn, proclaimed, urging Maduro to buy “a one-way ticket to
  Moscow”. Another Trump supporter, Congressman Carlos Gimenez, celebrated “the
  largest military presence we have ever had off the coast of Venezuela” and
  told Maduro to accept “his time is up!” The naval buildup and bellicose
  rhetoric might suggest Latin America is on the brink of an extraordinary
  foreign intervention, the likes of which the region hasn’t seen since US
  troops invaded Panama to overthrow its dictator, Manuel Noriega, in 1989. On
  Thursday, Cuba’s foreign ministry accused the US of seeking to turn “the
  waters of the Caribbean Sea into a war zone”. But Venezuela experts and former
  US diplomats are skeptical Caracas is about to suffer a Baghdad-style “shock
  and awe” assault. “This is all performance on both sides,” said Christopher
  Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House. “No one
  in their right mind thinks that with 4,500 people you can invade a country
  that’s got mountains, jungle and multiple urban centres,” Sabatini added,
  referring to the number of US military personnel being deployed to the
  Caribbean Sea as part of an “amphibious ready group” theoretically capable of
  launching an attack from the sea. James Story, the US’s top diplomat for
  Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, was similarly doubtful, suspecting the
  mobilization was “more about a show of force” than a “utilization of force”.
  Story believed many Venezuelans were so furious with Maduro’s destruction of
  the country’s economy and theft of last year’s presidential election that they
  wouldn’t necessarily oppose him being deposed by a foreign force. “But the
  belief that somehow this particular group of ships and the US government
  portends a military engagement, I don’t believe that to be true,” added Story,
  who thought insufficient assets were being deployed for a military attack.
  “Would it be capable of firing missiles, for instance, and doing a surgical
  strike against Fuerte Tiuna [the military base where Maduro is believed to
  live]? Yes, it could do that. But you could do that without such an
  ostentatious display of force as well. So the idea of there being an invasion,
  I don’t believe to be true,” said Story, who also believed Trump was generally
  against “meddling militarily in the affairs of other countries”. Evan Ellis, a
  Latin America specialist from the US Army War College, told the Financial
  Times the naval deployment would allow the US to put “a lot of forces on the
  ground pretty quickly”. Their “logical mission” would be “a snatch-and-grab
  operation to bring Maduro to justice”. But the academic, who served under
  secretary of state Mike Pompeo during Trump’s first administration, was not
  convinced Trump was “committed to pulling the trigger” on such a mission yet.
  Officially, Trump’s Caribbean deployment is part of US efforts to combat Latin
  American narco-traffickers, including a Venezuelan group called the Cartel de
  los Soles (Cartel of the Suns). Trump officials have accused Maduro of leading
  that cartel – charges the Venezuelan rejects – and recently slapped a $50m
  bounty on his head – twice the value once offered for Osama bin Laden’s
  capture. In July, Trump signed a secret directive authorizing the use of
  military force against Latin American cartels considered terrorist
  organizations, including the Venezuelan group. But Sabatini suspected Trump’s
  mobilization was largely about rattling the inner circle around Maduro and
  provoking “a massive defection” that would end his 12-year rule. “It’s amateur
  psyops,” Sabatini said, predicting such efforts would founder, just as they
  did in 2019, when Trump backed a botched attempt to topple Maduro by using
  threats and sanctions to encourage a military uprising that flopped. Back
  then, Trump’s national security advisor, John Bolton, claimed Maduro was
  “surrounded by scorpions in a bottle” and his downfall was “only a matter of
  time”. Six years on Maduro remains president and seems stronger than ever
  having claimed a third six-year term after allegedly stealing last July’s
  election. Thomas Shannon, a veteran US diplomat who has worked on Venezuela
  since the 90s, believed Trump was well aware the 2019 “regime-change effort”
  had failed “miserably”. That explained why the US president had started his
  second term trying a different approach: engaging with Maduro and sending his
  special envoy, Richard Grenell, to Caracas to negotiate. Licences allowing US
  energy firms such as Chevron to operate in Venezuela – which boasts the
  world’s largest known oil reserves – were initially left in place. “He even
  lets people know that there’s some degree of admiration for Maduro as a strong
  leader,” Shannon recalled. By May, however, Trump needed the support of
  Republican hardliners for his “big beautiful bill” for taxation. That required
  him to toughen his stance on Venezuela – at least superficially: hence the
  increasingly aggressive rhetoric and, now, the naval deployment. Asked on
  Thursday if Trump was considering strikes on military facilities in Venezuela,
  the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called Maduro the “fugitive
  head” of a “narco-terror cartel” and said: “The president is prepared to use
  every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country
  and to bring those responsible for justice”. “I think it’s intimidation,”
  Shannon said of the naval buildup, although that did not mean it was
  risk-free. “The danger … is that when you have that kind of military presence,
  the potential for something going wrong is always significant. And so the
  question is, what’s next?” Story and many Venezuelans suspect the answer is
  more of the same. “The safe money is that Maduro’s not going anywhere – that’s
  the easy call,” said the ex-diplomat, who saw no evidence of a serious plan
  for what might happen if Maduro was overthrown or how to handle the political
  and social chaos that would ensue. “I don’t think anybody has a good idea of
  what comes next, which to me implies that no one’s ready to take Maduro out,”
  Story said. On the calm streets of Caracas there is little sign of imminent
  conflict or change. As he took a break from playing football near Fuerte
  Tiuna, a 31-year-old accountant who gave his name as Hidalgo said he doubted
  the sabre-rattling would come to anything. Hidalgo hoped a democratic solution
  could be found for Venezuela’s political deadlock and that bloodshed could be
  avoided. “History teaches us that after this kind of conflict, what follows is
  chaos,” he said. “When there’s this kind of conflict it’s the innocent who
  always pay the price.”
