  KPop Demon Hunters: everyone is talking about it at school and on social
  media, but … what is it?

  OK, so what actually is KPop Demon Hunters? I’ve heard it mentioned by parents
  at school, by kids and randomly on social media but I am too lazy to Google
  it. Also, Google is terrible now. It’s been touted by Netflix as the
  platform’s most-watched original animated film ever. It tells the story of
  three hunters who use music’s power to move and connect hearts to create a
  barrier – the “golden Honmoon” – that will keep the forces of evil demons at
  bay. But probably just as importantly, it has everything: characters that
  grow, gorgeous animated visuals and a soundtrack I’ve been playing on repeat.
  That sounds great! Big fan of demon hunting. But is it for kids, adults, or
  both? Like many animated productions, it can be watched on multiple levels. I
  put the film on for my niece and nephew, who loved the action and fun
  animation. However, just as viewers can enjoy Wall-E or Spirited Away with
  childlike wonder at any age, the film’s story and characters might resonate
  with adults just as much. The characters of KPop Demon Hunters deal with
  survivors’ guilt, pressures to perform and finding their voices in a chaotic
  world. Are BlackPink in it? Or other legit K-pop stars? My K-pop knowledge is
  extremely limited. Though my kids occasionally sing the ‘ah pt pt’ song, if
  that helps. No BlackPink. In, fact the singing stars of KPop Demon Hunters
  come from relative obscurity. EJAE, who provides the singing voice for the
  main character, Rumi, had been considered an K-pop unsuccessful debut, and
  went on to find success on the other side of the recording booth, writing and
  producing. The same could be said for Andrew Choi – the singing voice of
  another major character, Jinu – whose career hadn’t gone far before this. It’s
  quite meta, really – that a movie about the pressures to keep up appearances
  has now shot two relative unknowns, previously unable to meet the K-pop
  industry’s infamous standards for beauty and perfection, to stardom. Even
  though it seems really popular, I haven’t seen ads for it. I only know about
  it from people talking about it in real life and on social media. What’s going
  on? It seems like Sony, the corporation behind the studio that created Kpop
  Demon Hunters didn’t have enough confidence to sell it themselves. According
  to Forbes, Sony sold the rights to KPop Demon Hunters to Netflix for just
  US$100m so I can imagine the hair-tearing frustration when the movie caught
  fire. Not only has it risen to the top of Netflix but four of its songs,
  Golden, How It’s Done, Soda Pop and Your Idol, took two out of five spots in
  Billboard’s top 5 charts. It’s safe to say the execs at Sony had no idea how
  much audiences would love it, and they paid dearly. Wow, OK. So is it good? It
  sounds like it is good. The fact that an entire month after its streaming
  release, its theatrical “sing-a-long” release in cinemas has packed out
  cinemas with kids and adults alike, says it all. In a world of AI slop, turns
  out the kids just want to be inspired by something Golden.
