  Ambulance services have taken 15 people to hospital after a bus veered into a
  pedestrian zone near Victoria station in central London. The driver of the 24
  bus, pedestrians and passengers were injured in the collision on Thursday
  morning, with witnesses saying they heard a big crash when the bus smashed
  into barriers at about 8.20am. Sam Genders, a maintenance worker who was
  working on a building on Allington Street when the bus crashed nearby, said:
  “It crashed into the barriers right in front of us. The bus driver crawled out
  the front covered in blood. All the glass was smashed. A lot of the passengers
  were injured. We were trying to help everyone out and get them off the bus. It
  was horrible, horrible scenes. “If the barrier wasn’t there, we probably
  wouldn’t be here right now.” His colleague Dave Short said emergency services
  arrived quickly and that an air ambulance arrived to take away injured people.
  “We were lucky. Lucky [also] that no one was crushed underneath it,” said
  Short. The London ambulance service said it treated 17 people, discharging two
  at the scene. There were no fatalities. Mohammed Ali, 40, a public safety
  officer at Victoria station, said he rushed to the scene after hearing the
  crash and saw about seven people injured. “There was blood all over the place
  and passengers lying on the floor,” said Ali, who immediately called emergency
  services. He said the bus should have turned right but that it appeared to
  have lost control and driven straight into a pedestrian zone. Ali said there
  was initial concern about smoke coming from the bus, which people said could
  have been caused by a damaged battery. There was a large emergency service
  response, including the air ambulance, several paramedics teams and the fire
  service. The police cordoned off a large area and said the road would remain
  closed for several hours. Pictures from the scene showed a large area cordoned
  off and crowds gathered around the site of the incident, which happened during
  the morning rush-hour. The Metropolitan police said in a statement that they
  had launched an investigation and were appealing for information from
  witnesses. Emit Suker, 47, told the PA Media news agency: “[The bus] was
  coming from Westminster – it was going really fast and came off the road.
  There were about 15, 16 people inside the bus. People were screaming – it was
  terrible.” Another witness told PA: “I heard a massive crash – came outside
  and there was a woman on the floor with loads of people around her. Lots of
  people from the gym had run out to help her.” A trail of diesel fuel running
  down Allington Street has forced police to ban smoking in the area over safety
  fears. Rosie Trew, TfL’s head of bus service delivery, said: “Our thoughts are
  with the people who have been injured following a bus incident at Victoria
  Street. We are working with the police and the operator, Transport UK, to
  urgently investigate this incident. “This must have been a distressing
  incident for everyone involved and we have support available for anyone
  affected.”
