  These past few weeks I have met dozens of businesses from across the United
  Kingdom. Pub and restaurant owners in Cornwall and Kent. Defence manufacturers
  in Belfast and Moray. Investment opportunities in Aberdeenshire and Port
  Talbot. I have seen an economy that has the ingredients for success – a
  skilled and committed workforce, world-class universities, innovative
  businesses. You don’t hear Reform or the Conservatives talk of this success.
  They want you to believe the economy is broken. That our best days are behind
  us and that the path of decline is inevitable. I fundamentally reject that. It
  is not the country I see around us, and it is not the future I believe in.
  Britain’s economy is not broken, but I know that in recent years it has got
  stuck. Austerity, a chaotic Brexit and Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget led
  to more than a decade of stagnation. Our economy became trapped in a cycle of
  low growth, repressed investment and stagnant income that weakened our
  competitiveness on the global stage. The months and weeks before any budget
  are filled with people speculating about – or claiming to know – what tax and
  spend decisions I will take or what the Office for Budget Responsibility will
  conclude. This budget is no different – I get that. I will set out the
  decisions I take in a responsible manner. But just as my focus over the past
  12 months has been about kickstarting economic growth for the benefits of
  working people, so will my next. Because Britain’s productivity problem is not
  an abstract, technocratic one – it directly affects every working family in
  Britain who feel they are squeezing every penny to make ends meet. When
  businesses can’t grow, wages stagnate and there is less money in the pockets
  of working people. When infrastructure is inadequate, costs rise, and
  opportunities are lost. When skills do not match economic needs, potential
  goes unfulfilled. With lower productivity, tax revenues go down and our public
  services face cuts. And with the world changing, Britain has been left too
  exposed to global shocks. Working people across Britain are striving and
  grafting, but they haven’t had the tools they need for the job. They have not
  seen their incomes rise as a reward for their hard work. There is that sinking
  feeling that families and businesses across the country feel at the end of
  every month that they are working hard, but getting nowhere. There is nothing
  progressive – nothing Labour – about an economy that is not productive and
  does not reward those who contribute. Since I became shadow chancellor and
  then chancellor, I have known that breaking this cycle will require our
  sustained effort across many fronts. Because if renewal is our mission and
  productivity is our challenge, then investment and reform are our tools. It’s
  investment into our infrastructure, from the train lines and roads that
  connect businesses and communities to each other to the building of new houses
  that working people need to fulfil the dream of owning a home. It’s investing
  in British workers and raising skills in this country, so we end business
  reliance on cheap migrant workers. We are providing that investment and
  unblocking the barriers to it too. Breaking down the planning system to get
  Britain building, cutting the unnecessary red tape that has stifled innovation
  rather than enabled it, and filling the skills gaps that are leaving
  businesses unable to expand and working people unable to progress. We are
  making progress: wages grew faster in our first 10 months in power than the
  first 10 years of Conservatives, 384,000 more jobs have been created, trade
  deals now struck with the United States, India and the European Union, the
  cost of a representative new variable rate mortgage lower than when we were
  elected, and millions of working people getting a pay rise from a boost to the
  national minimum wage. But I know there is more to do – and that is what this
  autumn will be about. Because I do not accept decline as inevitable. If
  Labour’s first year in power was about fixing the foundations, then the second
  year is about building a stronger economy for a renewed Britain. A renewed
  economy that works for working people – and rewards working people. That is my
  priority. That is my mission. That is what I am determined to deliver. Rachel
