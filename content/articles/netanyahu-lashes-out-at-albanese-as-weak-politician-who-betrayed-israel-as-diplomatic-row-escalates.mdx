  Benjamin Netanyahu has launched an extraordinary broadside against Anthony
  Albanese, labelling Australia’s prime minister “weak” in a social media post,
  hours after local Jewish groups called for calm in diplomatic relations.
  “History will remember Albanese for what he is: A weak politician who betrayed
  Israel and abandoned Australia’s Jews,” read a post on X from the account of
  Israel’s prime minister, on Tuesday evening Australian time. Albanese’s office
  was approached for comment. It came shortly after Australia’s peak Jewish
  group urged composure on Tuesday as Israel’s foreign minister warned of
  “additional measures” against Australia amid a diplomatic “tit-for-tat” over
  visa cancellations. “There are real-life consequences here and we want to see
  the countries work through any issues before things get out of hand,” said
  Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australia
  Jewry. The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, accused the Albanese
  government of “choosing to fuel” antisemitism after cancelling the visa of the
  far-right Israeli politician Simcha Rothman ahead of his planned speaking tour
  in Sydney and Melbourne later this week. Sa’ar also announced he would revoke
  the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, in a
  move labelled “unjustified” and “undermining international efforts towards
  peace and a two-state solution” by Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong.
  The escalating diplomatic row followed Australia’s decision earlier this month
  to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly in September after
  new commitments by the Palestinian Authority. The opposition leader, Sussan
  Ley, said while the prime minister deserved respect it was a “two-way street”
  and accused Albanese of making “bad decisions”. “It is up to Anthony Albanese
  to explain how he is going to repair this relationship which is now in tatters
  as a result of his failures of leadership,” she said. Rothman’s visa was
  cancelled by the home affairs department on Monday, citing “an unacceptable
  risk” to order in Australia and concern the member of Netanyahu’s governing
  coalition would make “inflammatory statements to promote his controversial
  views and ideologies”. In a Hebrew-language video message shortly after his
  statement, Sa’ar warned Australia was “persecuting Israel” and his government
  would “take additional measures”. But Jewish groups in Australia called for
  cooler heads to prevail in light of the countries’ “extensive economic,
  scientific and cultural ties”. Ryvchin said both countries should end the
  “diplomatic tit-for-tat that erodes the goodwill and cooperation built up over
  decades”. “Calm heads need to take control of the situation otherwise there
  will be a risk to some $2bn dollars in bilateral trade, extensive investment
  in Australian start-ups, vital security cooperation and the Israeli-made
  medicine and medical technology that we all rely on,” he said. The
  Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council said while it did not agree with
  many of Rothman’s views, it found the decision to cancel his visa to be a
  “disturbing precedent”. “It is very disappointing that Australia and Israel
  have regressed from a close friendship to unproductive diplomatic jousting,
  which of course was started by unwarranted and hostile actions by the
  Australian government,” the council said in a statement. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy
  Leibler, told the Jewish Independent website on Tuesday that Rothman’s views
  were “out of step with mainstream Israeli opinion and with the values of most
  Australian Jews”. But he criticised the decision to ban him, saying: “It is
  one thing to disagree strongly with an elected representative of a democracy
  and ally, it is quite another to deny them entry on that basis. Australia
  ought not to set such a precedent.” The progressive Jewish Council of
  Australia supported the decision but questioned why Rothman had been granted a
  visa in the first place. “As with Russia, members of Israel’s ruling coalition
  parties should already be subject to sanctions by the Australian government,
  including Rothman,” its spokesperson, Bart Shteinman, said. “Israel’s
  aggressive decision to retaliate to Rothman’s visa refusal by expelling
  Australian diplomats to the Palestinian Authority is a major escalation in
  hostilities against Australia. “If it needed any further demonstration, Israel
  is not interested in maintaining a relationship with the Australian government
  and cares little what strong words or statements it issues.” The department
  cited Rothman’s previous statements as part of its decision to revoke the visa
  they approved on 8 August. These included his claim in May that children
  within Gaza are “enemies” who should not be allowed to flee into Israel as
  “you don’t let them conquer your country with refugees”. In another example
  cited, Rothman was reported to have said the idea of a two-state solution
  between Israel and Palestine had “poisoned the minds of the entire world” and
  was the “first step toward the destruction of the state of Israel”. The
  department said that if it was publicly known that Rothman had entered
  Australia with the government’s permission, it “may encourage others to feel
  emboldened to voice any anti-Islamic sentiments”. The right-leaning Australian
  Jewish Association, who invited Rothman and organised the speaking tour, said
  it would host an online event with Rothman on Sunday evening, stating, the
  “show will go on”. Sa’ar’s decision to revoke the visas of three Australian
  diplomats – who are based in East Jerusalem and work in the West Bank – is
  expected to complicate Australia’s work with the Palestinian Authority. The
  foreign affairs department is working to remove the affected representatives.
