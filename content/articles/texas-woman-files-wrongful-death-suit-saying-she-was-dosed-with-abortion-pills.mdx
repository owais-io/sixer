  A Texas woman has sued a man she says dosed her with abortion pills against
  her will as well as the provider who she says supplied the pills. The woman,
  Julia, whose name has been changed for privacy, on Monday filed a federal
  wrongful death lawsuit against the telemedicine abortion service Aid Access
  and its founder, Dr Rebecca Gomperts, as well as a man, John (whose name has
  also been changed), a US marine who Julia said impregnated her and
  subsequently dosed her with abortion pills. Julia is being represented in the
  lawsuit by Jonathan Mitchell, a lawyer who masterminded the Texas six-week
  abortion ban and has become one of the major architects of anti-abortion
  strategy in the post-Roe v Wade era. Mitchell has represented men in lawsuits
  who have sued abortion providers after accusing their female partners of
  undergoing abortions against their wishes, but this case is thought to be the
  first of its kind with a female plaintiff. After Julia revealed her pregnancy
  to John, he repeatedly pressured her to get an abortion and went so far as to
  order abortion pills online from Aid Access, a service that ships abortion
  pills to all 50 US states, according to Julia’s lawsuit, which includes
  extensive screenshots of texts between John and Julia. When Julia refused to
  take the pills, John allegedly browbeat her and suggested that he testify
  against Julia in her ongoing divorce proceeding against her ex-husband. Julia
  told John that her ex-husband had physically and emotionally abused both Julia
  and her three children, the lawsuit alleges. Then, in April 2025, John
  proposed that he come over to Julia’s house for a “trust building night”,
  according to the lawsuit. While Julia stepped outside to let her dog in, John
  allegedly dissolved at least 10 abortion pills into her hot chocolate.
  Typically, US abortions consist of two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol.
  While mifepristone is usually swallowed, misoprostol is meant to dissolve
  slowly in the vagina, under the tongue or in the cheeks. Soon afterward, Julia
  began cramping and bleeding, her lawsuit alleges. John said that he would pick
  up Julia’s mother, so that she could watch Julia’s children while they went to
  the emergency room. However, John did not return. Julia then allegedly
  discovered the box of mifepristone that John had ordered from Aid Access,
  which John had left at her house. The box was empty. Julia also allegedly
  found an orange pill bottle containing both mifepristone and misoprostol
  pills. She rushed to the ER but ended up miscarrying eight weeks into her
  pregnancy. There is no medical test that can determine whether abortion pills,
  if taken orally, caused the end of a pregnancy. The lawsuit, which was
  previously reported by Autonomy News, is now seeking “nominal, compensatory,
  and punitive damages”. In addition to accusing John, Aid Access and Gomperts
  of violating multiple laws in Texas – where virtually all abortions are banned
  – it alleges that the trio also violated the federal Comstock Act, a
  19th-century anti-vice law that outlaws the mailing of abortion-related
  materials. Legal experts long regarded the Comstock Act as a dead letter,
  since Roe v Wade kept its ban on abortion-related materials from taking effect
  for decades. However, since the US supreme court overturned Roe in 2022,
  anti-abortion advocates such as Mitchell say it can now be revived. They have
  repeatedly cited the Comstock Act in lawsuits, in the hope that courts will
  decide to let it take full effect. Aid Access, Gomperts and the US marines did
  not respond to a request for comment. Reached by phone, John said he had no
  comment on the lawsuit. Telemedicine groups including Aid Access are currently
  mailing abortion pills through the use of “shield laws”, which have been
  enacted in a handful of blue states since Roe fell. These laws, which aim to
  protect abortion providers from facing civil and criminal liability if they
  mail pills to people who live in states that ban abortion, have proven
  critical to post-Roe abortion provision, as abortion pills make up an
  increasing share of all US abortions. Between 2023 and 2024, Aid Access
  shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents, according to a
  new study released on Monday. However, shield laws have not been tested in
  court. Recently, Texas sued a New York court official for refusing to fine a
  New York-based abortion provider, as the official had said that New York’s
  shield law blocked him from enforcing the fine.
