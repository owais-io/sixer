  Disgraced New South Wales MP Gareth Ward has been remanded in custody to await
  sentencing after he was convicted last week for serious sex offences against
  two young men. He will be sentenced on 19 September. Justice Kara Shead said
  she was “unpersuaded” that the offender, because of his profile or
  disabilities, could not be managed in a custodial setting. The 44-year-old MP
  for Kiama was emotionless as he received the news in the dock. Ward had been
  permitted to remain free after last week’s verdict under strict bail
  conditions requiring him to remain at his either his residence on the South
  Coast or his flat in Sydney. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Prosecutor Monika
  Knowles applied to the NSW district court on Wednesday to have Ward jailed.
  She noted that due to the seriousness of Ward’s crimes that there was
  virtually no chance he would avoid a custodial sentence. On Friday, a jury
  found Ward guilty of three counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual
  intercourse without consent. The lesser convictions carry a maximum penalty of
  five years and the more serious rape conviction a maximum penalty of 14 years.
  Shead said she did not regard either Ward’s profile as an MP, or his physical
  disabilities – he is almost legally blind due to eyesight issues associated
  with albinism – as giving rise to special or exceptional circumstances that
  would warrant him remaining free after a conviction. However, she agreed he
  should be assessed for protection and be provided with a laptop with as large
  a screen as possible and with a pdf reader to assist him in preparing for
  sentencing. Ward’s barrister, Edward Anderson, had argued that placing his
  client in a general remand prison prior to sentencing would put him at risk of
  harm or degrading treatment given his unique circumstances. “Mr Ward, given
  the combination of his occupation and profile (as a member of parliament), the
  nature of his offending, the combination of his not-insignificant disabilities
  which have been largely overcome outside custody so he can lead a normal life
  – he would be a particularly vulnerable person in custody,” he said. “This
  unique combination would make him a particular target in custody … for
  physical violence or otherwise,” he said. Knowles responded that there were
  processes in place to manage a person in Ward’s position. “Mr Ward is not the
  first high-profile person to find himself in a this situation,” she said.
  Expulsion from parliament The Minns government is expected to move a motion
  next Tuesday to expel Ward from the NSW Parliament. It is expected to be
  supported by the opposition. Ward has not yet indicated whether he will appeal
  but has continued to say he is innocent. Expulsion motions have rarely been
  used and can be appealed. The matter will become more complicated if Ward
  appeals. A successful motion would trigger a byelection in Ward’s South Coast
  seat. In 2013, Ward invited a drunk 18-year-old man to his South Coast home.
  The man told the jury that Ward plied him with drinks before indecently
  assaulting him three times in one night, despite his attempts to resist. Two
  years later, the MP sexually assaulted an intoxicated political staffer after
  a midweek event at NSW Parliament House. Ward had enjoyed a strong personal
  following in the seat and was re-elected in 2023 as an independent despite
  having been charged with the serious sex offences in the months before the
  election. He had previously held the seat as a member of the Liberal party. •
