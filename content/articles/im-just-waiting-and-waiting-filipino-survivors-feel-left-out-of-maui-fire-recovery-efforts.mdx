  Alfred Dasugo, 84, says he’s tired of waiting for help. A Filipino immigrant,
  Dasugo has called Lahaina home for more than a half century. As a young
  musician, he performed at the Royal Lahaina Resort with famed ukulele player
  Nelson Waikiki. Later, he spent 25 years working for Maui county parks and
  recreation, coaching volleyball and basketball to generations of youths. After
  the catastrophic 2023 Maui wildfires engulfed the town, killing at least 102
  people and destroying more than 2,000 homes, Dasugo bounced between hotels
  under a temporary housing program fully funded by the Federal Emergency
  Management Agency (Fema). Then, after 18 months, the agency began charging him
  rent. Dasugo appealed to Fema, which deducted only a fraction of his rent,
  leaving him with a hefty bill of $1,215 a month. Unable to afford rent and
  three meals a day, he tried to get on food stamps, but was told his “income
  was too high”, even though he was living off social security checks. He
  applied for a host of temporary housing projects, but none had any openings.
  The wait time for some modular homes, he said, is two years. “All I’m doing is
  just waiting and waiting and waiting,” Dasugo said. Filipinos like Dasugo
  accounted for about 40% of Lahaina’s pre-fire population and form the backbone
  of its lucrative tourism industry. Two years after the deadliest US wildfire
  in more than a century, many say they have been left behind in Maui county’s
  wildfire recovery efforts due to long-standing socio-economic disparities, as
  well as language and cultural barriers. It’s a systemic failure that some
  advocates say reflects Hawaii’s colonial history and the exploitation Filipino
  immigrants have long faced. From 1906 to 1946, the Hawaiian Sugar Planters
  Association recruited more than 120,000 Filipino migrant laborers, called
  sakadas, to work on the islands’ sugar and pineapple fields. As the Hawaiian
  economy shifted from plantations to tourism, Filipinos became overrepresented
  in service jobs. Today, they are the largest immigrant and the largest
  undocumented group in Hawaii. Filipinos are “essentially seen and treated as a
  labor source” at “the bottom of the social hierarchy in Hawaii”, said Nadezna
  Ortega, a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and executive
  director of Tagnawa, a Filipino feminist disaster response organization in
  Hawaii. The disproportionately high number of Filipinos employed in the
  tourism industry has made them particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout
  of the wildfires, advocates say, as hotel occupancy rates and related jobs
  were slow to return to pre-disaster levels. “Most Filipino families in Lahaina
  are living paycheck to paycheck, and that was before the fire,” said Eric
  Arquero, executive director of Kaibigan ng Lāhaina, a non-profit supporting
  Filipinos and immigrants in west Maui. “We’re realizing basic needs like food,
  healthcare are now taking a secondary, tertiary backseat.” One in three
  Filipino wildfire survivors has experienced PTSD symptoms, and nearly half are
  struggling to put food on the table, according to a report from Tagnawa. This
  financial anxiety has also led to a spike in domestic violence. A more recent
  report from Tagnawa found that more than half of female Filipino fire
  survivors reported an increase in conflict at home. One in five said they felt
  unsafe in places where they sought shelter; a similar number reported engaging
  in “survival sex” – kissing, hugging, touching or intercourse – in exchange
  for housing, food or clothes. Community organizers say many Filipinos have
  been left out of relief programs that do not take into consideration their
  renter status and cultural background. Community surveys found that more than
  two-thirds of Filipino survivors were renters prior to the fire, but the
  $1.6bn in federal disaster funds were primarily earmarked for efforts to
  rebuild owner-occupied homes, leaving little for direct rental assistance. The
  process of rebuilding Lahaina has been excruciatingly slow for all. As of
  early August, only 45 homes in Lahaina have been rebuilt, with more than 400
  permits issued. No commercial buildings have been rebuilt. The majority of
  survivors remain in temporary housing or have left the island. In addition,
  Filipinos in Lahaina primarily speak Ilocano or Tagalog; nearly two-thirds
  live in non-English speaking households. Yet applications and information
  about resources are often only in English. “It’s been quite a road for an
  organization like ours,” said Arquero, of Kaibigan ng Lāhaina, whose
  translators helped bridge the gap between survivors and government agencies.
  “The Filipino community here became its own diaspora.” Arquero said direct
  translations from English to Tagalog and Ilocano were incredibly challenging
  and time-consuming for an organization that has limited resources and staff.
  Nelson Salvador, the interim executive director of the Hawaiʻi Workers Center,
  said the worst might still be forthcoming. Direct assistance programs through
  Fema are set to expire in six months, and if the government does not extend
  aid, he said evictions could rise after benefits end. In late May, Filipino
  organizers with the Hawaiʻi Workers Center launched the Lahaina Filipino Fire
  Survivors Association, a grassroots initiative to address the most urgent
  needs of survivors, including pushing for an extension of Fema assistance, a
  rental assistance program and a community advisory board made up of renters,
  including many Filipino families and workers. Another barrier survivors faced
  is new living arrangements that disrupted traditional support systems. Many
  lived in multigenerational households, relying on one another for care, and
  being separated into cramped hotel rooms was often a traumatizing experience.
  As a result, the mental and physical health of elders suffered from being
  isolated from loved ones, advocates say. Chamille Serrano, a bank worker, and
  her family have moved four times in the past two years, going from hotels to
  Airbnbs to a brief period of homelessness. Her grandson, she said, was just
  two months old when the fire erupted. “Even when we were moving from one place
  to another, it was also a full-time job,” said Cerrano, who immigrated from
  the Philippines to Lahaina in 1987. Since moving into a modular home in
  Lahaina last December, through a county-funded temporary housing program, she
  said she’s felt more at peace, knowing that her family won’t have to uproot
  their lives again until their old house is rebuilt. But the trauma still
  lingers. “Losing that house from my mom and my dad – I have not gotten to the
  acceptance phase,” she said, her voice breaking. “It’s been two years and it’s
  still fresh for me.”
