  David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog after going
  fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during the US
  vice-president’s trip to the UK. The foreign secretary hosted Vance and his
  family at Chevening House in Kent last week, where the pair fished from the
  property’s private lake. Anglers aged 13 and over must hold a rod licence to
  fish for freshwater species such as carp in England and Wales. Lammy failed to
  land a catch, but “all of my kids did”, Vance said. The Foreign Office said an
  “administrative oversight” meant licences had not been obtained in advance.
  Lammy bought them as soon as he was made aware, and wrote to the Environment
  Agency to acknowledge the breach. “He also thanked them for their work
  protecting Britain’s fisheries,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said. The
  agency confirmed the licences had since been bought. All fish caught during
  the visit were returned to the water. The fishing trip formed part of a wider
  UK tour by Vance, who was on holiday in the Cotswolds with his wife, Usha, and
  three children. The visit has combined family time with private political
  meetings and a heavy security presence in the normally quiet Oxfordshire
  countryside. Vance’s stay at Dean Manor, an 18th-century Georgian home,
  reportedly arranged by the former chancellor George Osborne, led to road
  closures, police checkpoints and the installation of a temporary helipad.
  Pippa and Johnny Hornby, who own the property, later apologised to residents
  for the “circus” caused by the vice-president’s security detail. Protesters
  from the Stop Trump Coalition held a “Vance not welcome” party in nearby
  Charlbury, attended by about 100 people carrying placards and cakes mocking
  the Republican politician. Some slogans took aim at Vance’s record on abortion
  and LGBTQ+ rights. On Wednesday evening, Vance was greeted by dozens of
  pro-Palestine protesters bashing pots and pans as he arrived at the luxury
  Carnell Estate near Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire. Vance has held informal talks
  with senior Conservatives, including the shadow justice secretary, Robert
  Jenrick, and the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp. He also attended a
  breakfast with Nigel Farage. According to US and UK officials, discussions
  with Lammy covered Ukraine, Gaza, trade and concerns from Washington about
  aspects of UK legislation, including the Online Safety Act. The Foreign Office
  said Lammy and Vance had enjoyed a warm and constructive meeting. Vance
  described the foreign secretary as a good friend and “very, very gracious
  host” despite his failure to catch a fish.
