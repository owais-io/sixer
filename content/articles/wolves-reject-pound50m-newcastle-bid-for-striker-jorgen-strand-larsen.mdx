  Wolves have rejected a £50m bid from Newcastle for Jørgen Strand Larsen and
  maintain the striker is not for sale. The club are aware Newcastle identified
  Strand Larsen as a key target but their stance is they cannot afford to sell
  the Norwegian before the transfer window closes on Monday. Wolves deem him
  irreplaceable owing to the timing and his record as a Premier League
  goalscorer. Newcastle are without a bona fide No 9 amid the continued absence
  of Alexander Isak and the departure of Callum Wilson at the end of his
  contract. The Wolves head coach, Vítor Pereira, deems Strand Larsen his only
  senior striker. The 25‑year‑old forward scored 14 top-flight goals for the
  club last season and joined in a £23m deal in July after a successful loan
  from Celta Vigo. Strand Larsen He was withdrawn towards the end of Wolves’
  defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday with what Pereira described as a minor
  achilles problem. Wolves have sold Matheus Cunha and Rayan Aït-Nouri this
  summer and the former club captain Nélson Semedo departed for Fenerbahce after
  rejecting a new contract. Pereira is hopeful of offloading Fábio Silva, a £35m
  signing in 2020, on a permanent deal, while Hwang Hee-chan and Sasa Kalajdzic
  could also move before the deadline. Newcastle have so far failed in attempts
  to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford, who are holding out for what they deem a
  fair price for the forward, while Benjamin Sesko preferred a move to
  Manchester United. Newcastle were also interested in Liam Delap and João
  Pedro, both of whom joined Chelsea. Pereira wants at least three more
  signings: a central defender, with the club pushing for Girona’s Ladislav
  Krejci, a central midfielder and a versatile forward are priorities.
