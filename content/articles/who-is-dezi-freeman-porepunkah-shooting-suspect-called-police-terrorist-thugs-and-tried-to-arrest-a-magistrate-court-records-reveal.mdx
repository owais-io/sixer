  Dezi Freeman, the man suspected of shooting and killing two police officers
  and injuring a third at a rural Victorian property, said he had a history of
  unpleasant encounters with the force, who he called “terrorist thugs”,
  “frigging Nazis” and “Gestapo” that wore “the Satanic symbol” of an “inverted
  pentagram” on their uniforms, according to court records. Freeman also has a
  history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. Victorian
  police chief commissioner, Mike Bush, said the suspect was believed to be
  “heavily armed” and remained at large on Wednesday night. Police had been
  executing a search warrant in relation to alleged sexual offending by Freeman,
  who was previously known as Desmond Filby. Court records paint a picture of a
  man with a deep distrust of police and embrace of conspiracies: he once, for
  example, attempted to arrest a magistrate during a bizarre court hearing in
  Wangaratta. Last year, a Victorian county court judge found Freeman was guilty
  of using a mobile phone while driving and refusing to provide a saliva sample
  to police in September 2020 on the Great Alpine Road. But he lodged a legal
  battle after the judge cancelled Freeman’s licence and disqualified him from
  obtaining a licence for a period of two years from 8 April 2024. A supreme
  court judgment published last November, after Freeman sought a judicial review
  of the county court decision, showed he tried to argue that the police radar
  device used to detect speed may have been influenced by power lines and
  transformers, or microwave transmissions, in the area. During
  cross-examination in the county court, he accused an officer of arranging for
  one of her colleagues to cancel Freeman’s firearms licence after the incident,
  which she denied. Freeman said: “How was it fair that when I haven’t arrested
  you for the multitude of crimes you have committed and I haven’t exposed you
  or other police to the multitude of crimes they have committed, for the logs
  in their eyes, how is it fair that you go after me for the splinter in mine?”
  He told the court he had a difficult childhood, but had overcome disadvantage,
  though “had a history of unpleasant encounters with police officers”. Freeman
  claimed that during the police intercept – which started while he was on the
  way to a local fish and chip shop with his children in the car, and ended when
  he sped down a dirt road in Porepunkah - he was acting in self-defence. “I
  felt threatened and preyed upon …. even the sight of a cop or a cop car … it’s
  like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier,” he said. “What’s worse than
  a swastika is the inverted pentagram, the Satanic symbol that they wear and
  they behave like it as well.” Freeman claimed he had been subject to past
  unlawful conduct by officers as part of a “a lifetime of bullying and
  predatorial (sic) behaviour by police”. A video of the interaction with
  officers, referred to in the supreme court judgment, showed Freeman calling
  the officers terrorists, and saying “out here with guns, guns, terrorising my
  kids again. I’ve been to court 15 times because of you corrupt scum. You
  corrupt filth.” Justice James Gorton noted in his supreme court judgment that
  Freeman, who represented himself in the proceedings, and in the county court,
  felt “genuinely aggrieved” at losing his licence for two years, as it would
  “seriously interfere with his and his family’s life” and lead to “hardship”.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email Freeman is believed to have lived in the
  region for most of his life. He claimed on social media to have taken a photo
  the nearby Kiewa Valley in about 2004 that was used in tourism brochures in
  the area. Other family members also live in the state north-east. In 2019,
  Freeman helped fundraise for his younger brother James Filby after the shock
  death of his wife. She died from a bacterial infection that also left James in
  intensive care. James Filby posted on Facebook this week: “My prayers are with
  the fallen police and their grieving familes(sic).” In 2021, Freeman was
  arrested while at a protest outside Myrtleford court, over 2019 allegations of
  sexual-related offending, according to a Border Mail article. In footage of
  him being taken into custody, the then 51-year-old man identified himself as
  Des Freeman when asked his name, the Border Mail reported. The Myrtleford
  court protest was in response to a private prosecution brought against the
  then Victorian premier Daniel Andrews accusing him of treason during Covid.
  But it was struck out by the magistrate because charge information had not
  been provided to Andrews. In a video posted on Facebook in December 2021,
  Freeman told magistrate Peter Dunn that he was under arrest for “aiding and
  abetting” and “perverting the course of justice”. “You are now in my custody
  and under arrest. You are not free to leave,” he said. Freeman has a history
  of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas and influencers.
  “Sovereign citizens” or pseudolaw adherents often have a range of
  conspiratorial beliefs, including that a country’s laws have become
  illegitimate and the government is corrupted, leading them to reject its
  authority. On a pseudolaw podcast in 2019, Freeman called himself a
  photographer from north-east Victoria. He described his battle with “newcomers
  from Melbourne” who he claimed had closed off a road “that’s been used for 120
  years”. He described his day in court, which included telling the magistrate
  he had “no rightful authority” and instructing police to arrest him. “The
  police officers were informed that it’s their duty to make the arrest, which
  they refused to do. No surprises there,” he said. “The law is the law. No one
  is above it. I don’t care if it’s the Queen or the Pope or ‘Scumo’ or whoever
  it is.” A 2018 episode of A Current Affair featured Freeman and his family
  complaining about a neighbourly dispute at their then Mount Buffalo property.
  The report said Freeman and his family complained about their neighbour’s dirt
  bike stunts, loud chainsaws and verbal abuse five years before the broadcast.
  Freeman described the dispute as “full out war” and said his neighbours were
  the “instigators” of it. The ACA report said Freeman and his family were
  leaving the property where they had lived for six years.
