  The actor Ray Brooks, who has died aged 86 after suffering from dementia, will
  be remembered by many television viewers for his mop of curly hair as he
  enjoyed a string of comedy successes in the 1980s and 90s. Later, switching to
  soap with EastEnders, he played Pauline Fowler’s second husband, Joe Macer,
  who killed Pauline in a Christmas Day row in 2006 that ended with him hitting
  her over the head with a frying pan. But Brooks had made an indelible mark on
  screen early in his career in two productions that captured contrasting sides
  of the swinging 60s. First came a starring role in the 1965 film comedy The
  Knack … and How to Get It, as Tolen, the sharp-dressing womaniser who tutors
  his fellow lodger, Colin (played by Michael Crawford), a shy teacher, in the
  art of seduction, with Rita Tushingham as Nancy, their guinea pig. The New
  York Times described Brooks as “the ultimate in cool, with his dark suit, dark
  glasses, hipster haircut, droopy eyelids and disrobing voice”. The director
  Richard Lester’s “new wave” style helped to make The Knack, based on Ann
  Jellicoe’s stage play, a landmark film of the 60s featuring fast-moving visual
  gags intercut with documentary-like asides from an older generation deploring
  the collapse of public morals. It won the top prize, the Palme d’Or, at the
  Cannes film festival. Brooks was collected from his London flat by a
  Rolls-Royce at the start of a journey via Heathrow that ended at the Carlton
  Cannes hotel. “Every big star of the day you can think of was there and
  anything we wanted we just signed for it,” he recalled. “It was a
  once-in-a-lifetime experience.” Glamour was replaced by social realism when
  Brooks was suggested to Ken Loach – another pioneering director who shot
  documentary-style – and cast as Reg, the husband of Carol White’s title
  character, in Cathy Come Home, based on a story by Jeremy Sandford. This 1966
  Wednesday Play on BBC television was an uncompromising attack on council house
  waiting lists and the policy of separating husbands from their homeless wives
  and children. Twelve million viewers watched the story of Reg losing his
  lorry-driver’s job, plunging his family into a downward spiral of poverty.
  Public and political outrage followed, and councils changed their rules on
  separating couples. Industry professionals later voted it the best television
  drama of the 20th century in a British Film Institute poll. But Brooks’s
  career failed to soar as he might have expected. In an interview in 2010, he
  said: “I don’t think I was ever that good an actor. I was more an image of a
  young man. I was never as good looking as, say, my contemporary, David
  Hemmings. And don’t forget this was the period of Terence Stamp. So there was
  a lot of competition.” He kept working, popping up as a character actor,
  mostly in television dramas, and building up a profitable career as a
  voiceover artist on commercials for products such as Flora, Whiskas, Marmite
  and R White’s lemonade. Brooks also narrated the fondly remembered BBC cartoon
  series Mr Benn (1971-72), adapted by David McKee from his own children’s books
  about a bowler-hatted man taken on adventures via a fez-wearing fancy-dress
  shop owner. Only 13 episodes were made, although they were repeated for more
  than 20 years – but Brooks earned nothing on top of his original fee. His
  television acting career was revived when he landed the role of a no-hope
  gambler, Robby Box, the poker-playing boyfriend of Jan Oliver (Sharon Duce),
  in the comedy-drama Big Deal (1984-86). He followed it by playing Max Wild,
  who walks out on his wife and grown-up daughter as he faces a midlife crisis,
  in the sitcom Running Wild (1987-89). Less successful was Roy Clarke’s
  comedy-drama The World of Eddie Weary (1990), with Brooks as Alex Conway, an
  actor playing a private detective in a TV programme. A series never followed
  the pilot episode. But he was back to winning ways as Tom Hollingsworth in the
  sitcom Growing Pains (1992-93), teamed again with Duce, this time with the
  pair as a middle-aged couple becoming foster parents. They had previously
  played the same parts in a BBC radio version (1989-90). Another fallow period
  ended when Brooks enthusiastically accepted the role of the widowed Joe in
  EastEnders (2005-07). But he was soon disillusioned with what he later called
  the “shabby sets and poor scripts” and “lack of rehearsal time”. Wendy
  Richard, who played Pauline Fowler, complained about the producers’ plans for
  her character’s marriage to Joe. After they went ahead, Richard resigned and
  was written out of the soap. Pauline’s death was followed weeks later by
  Joe’s, in a fall from a first-floor window. It was Brooks’s last screen role.
  Brooks was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to a single mother, Adelaide Roach,
  who worked as a bus conductor. She later told him that his father was called
  John Brooks and lived with a wife and two children just a short distance away.
  His mother went on to marry three times. She introduced her son to the arts,
  taking him to see films in the town’s cinemas and concerts at the Brighton
  Dome, and sent him for elocution lessons. He acted in local amateur dramatics
  and, on leaving Xaverian college, a Roman Catholic school, worked in the wages
  office for a bus company. In 1956, aged 17, he joined Nottingham Playhouse as
  an assistant stage manager and made his acting debut there, with two lines as
  John Hunter in a production that year of Treasure Island. Brooks’s early
  television parts included Lucius, Brutus’s servant, in Julius Caesar (1960),
  Terry Mills, training as a driver with a cab owner played by Sid James, in the
  sitcom Taxi! (1963-64) and Norman Phillips (1963-64), who replaced Dennis
  Tanner as an agency’s talent scout, in Coronation Street. In films, he
  appeared alongside Billy Fury in the pop musical Play It Cool and Alec
  Guinness and Dirk Bogarde in HMS Defiant (both 1962), as well as playing one
  of three teenage tearaways in Some People the same year. He also played a
  resistance fighter tackling Doctor Who’s enemies in Daleks – Invasion Earth
  2150 AD (1966) and a Spanish waiter in Carry On Abroad (1972). While slipping
  below star billing on TV, he found some compensation on the West End stage in
  the 70s and, at the National Theatre in 1981, he was acclaimed for his role as
  Weinberl in Tom Stoppard’s farce On the Razzle. He was a regular Jackanory
  storyteller on TV from 1969 to 1979 and wrote an autobiography titled Learning
  My Lines: From Cathy Come Home to EastEnders (2009). In 1963, Brooks married
  Sadie Elcombe (nee Markins). She died in 2021; their daughter, Emma, had died
  in 2003. He is survived by their sons, Will and Tom. • Raymond Michael Brooks,
  actor, born 20 April 1939; died 9 August 2025 • This article was amended on 14
  August 2025. Ray Brooks’ wife, Sadie, died in 2021.
