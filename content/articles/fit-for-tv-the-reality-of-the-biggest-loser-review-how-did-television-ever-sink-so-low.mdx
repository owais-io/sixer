  The mid-2000s were a peculiar time in television. After the dubious 90s
  innovations of Jerry Springer in the US were followed by the UK launch of Big
  Brother, it was clear that using the travails of so-called ordinary people as
  fuel for small-screen entertainment was an idea with legs. There was a mini
  goldrush of sorts as programme makers realised that conflict, extremity and
  dysfunction would always sell – and that any human-interest subject could be
  shoehorned into some version of reality TV. In Britain, ITV’s The Jeremy Kyle
  Show began casting its malign spell in 2005. In the US, something similarly
  queasy (and enduring) had arrived a year earlier in the shape of NBC’s weight
  loss bootcamp-meets-bearpit, The Biggest Loser, which took contestants living
  with obesity then belittled them with humiliating tasks such as moving food
  from one place to another using only their teeth. It deployed fitness coaches
  to scream abuse in their faces, and weighed them in front of a studio
  audience. For the series winner, there was, in addition to a newly slimline
  body, a large cash prize. The first former contestant we meet in this
  three-part documentary about the show is season eight winner Danny Cahill.
  Danny does not look like someone who has lost large amounts of weight. This is
  an intimation of trouble ahead. Could it be that losing weight over a
  recklessly short period of time is not a sustainable way of combating obesity?
  Might it even be dangerous? Quite possibly. We’re told that a high percentage
  of former contestants who later took part in a New York Times study put much
  of their weight back on after the show. And the study suggested the
  programme’s hothouse methods caused people’s metabolisms to slow, making them
  less able to process food quickly. How about aftercare? The Biggest Loser
  simply didn’t bother with it, as the producers openly admit. In the context of
  the stories in Fit for TV, that feels unforgivable. For season one winner Ryan
  Benson, weight loss quickly became a means to an end. “I lost all focus on
  getting healthy,” he says. “It was about winning.” Shortly after the final
  episode, blood was found in his urine. It was around that time that he was
  congratulated (after a fashion) by one of the show’s two fitness trainers, the
  permanently snarling Jillian Michaels. “Ryan, you just made me a millionaire,”
  she apparently said. Michaels declined to be interviewed for this series,
  which is a shame from a journalistic point of view but a relief in every other
  way. The show’s other gym beast, Bob Harper, does front up. He is fairly
  forthright in his defence of the show, claiming that many people were helped –
  although his habit of lifting his small dog on to his lap when difficult
  subjects arise feels revealing. He also manages, in four throwaway words, to
  make a watertight case against the show. “Everyone knows it’s diet,” he says,
  when discussing sustainable weight loss strategies. What offhand disdain for
  viewers and participants is contained in that short sentence. Everyone here is
  being taken for a mug. Because when it comes to the creation of TV, what use
  is a diet? Watching people not eating doughnuts and burgers is no fun. Can’t
  we push them until they vomit instead? The author and podcaster Aubrey Gordon,
  who has written and spoken extensively about weight-related issues, pinpoints
  the crucial problem. The Biggest Loser wanted to have its calorific cake and
  eat it. It encouraged participants to trust the process and then misled them
  at every turn. “The show was trying to do deep emotional work,” she says. “But
  it didn’t want to have people who were credentialed to do it.” And so, she
  suggests that the trainers became pseudo-therapists as well as drill
  sergeants. They were both carrot and stick. Ultimately, the documentary claims
  that they simply couldn’t be trusted, as evinced in their giving contestants
  caffeine pills to stimulate energy and suppress appetite, even as the
  programme’s resident medic was telling them not to drink coffee. Perhaps
  fittingly, this documentary feels somewhat frantic in places – it’s as jittery
  and frenetic as a caffeine-fuelled workout. It would probably have benefited
  from fewer voices, a little more analysis and a clearer narrative
  through-line. However, the stories it tells are powerful enough to stick in
  the memory, as warnings from recent history. As the age of truly nasty reality
  TV passes (for now), documentaries about these kinds of shows are starting to
  feel like their own microgenre, with their own tropes. As with earlier series
  about Jerry Springer (on Netflix) and Jeremy Kyle (on Channel 4), there is a
  limited, grudging mea culpa or two. There is also plenty of buck-passing.
  There are obvious villains and equally obvious victims. And somewhere at the
  back of it all is a sense that, even at this point, it’s all in the game. For
  now, TV’s appetite for extremity has taken a back seat to its willingness to
  acknowledge duty of care. This may not always be the case. • Fit for TV: The
