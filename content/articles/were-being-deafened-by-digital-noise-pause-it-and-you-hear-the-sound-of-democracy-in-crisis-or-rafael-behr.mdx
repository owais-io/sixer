  Returning from holiday, asked where I have been, I want to say “offline”. The
  more precise answer is France, where the internet is available. But I tried
  not to use it compulsively because there isn’t much point in getting away from
  it all if you carry it all with you on a phone and check it every few minutes.
  At some point in the past decade or so, the condition of vacation came to be
  defined more by detachment from the digital realm than departure from home.
  The break begins not in a departure lounge but with the act of logging off,
  setting the out-of-office email auto-reply, archiving work-related WhatsApp
  chats, deleting social media apps. The benefit isn’t immediate. The cacophony
  rings in your ears for a few days before you notice the stillness, the change
  in tempo. It is the difference between gliding on thermal currents of private
  thought and hurtling along rails, propelled by the burning urgency of other
  people’s opinions. The contrast is even starker in reverse, the roar of the
  tunnel as you go back to work, the jostle of notifications, the bowed head,
  scrolling the horizon away. I’m not an analogue nostalgist. I don’t prefer
  getting lost to having Google Maps. I don’t think people were better informed
  when they had fewer channels or were less vulnerable to superstition when
  clerical authority was absolute. We are now in the third decade of the first
  digital century. The revolution is irreversible and of unknowable duration.
  History has had a number of these explosive profusions of interconnectedness,
  driven by a radical innovation in communication technology. But not many. The
  writer Naomi Alderman calls them “information crises”, and argues that the
  present one is only the third. The printing press was the second. The
  invention of writing some time around the fourth millennium BC was the first.
  The comparison doesn’t have to be exact for us to marvel at the scale of what
  we are experiencing. It is immeasurable because we don’t know how far along
  the track we have travelled. AI is only getting started. Readers of the
  Gutenberg Bible in the late 15th century had no means of anticipating the ways
  that movable type would transform European social, cultural, economic and
  political organisation. Are we better equipped to imagine the world after
  another 100 years of digital Reformation? My measly fortnight of technological
  temperance isn’t likely to afford much additional perspective. But it is a
  reminder that the transformation under way is operating at a cognitive level.
  When you switch the information flow off for a moment, or just dial it down a
  bit, you appreciate how intense and overwhelming it is the rest of the time.
  Our brains evolved to handle the relatively limited dataset of an immediate
  physical environment, tracking the bush for predators, eking a survival
  strategy from scarce resources. We are organic processing units. Our capacity
  for rational judgment is limited by the rate at which we can turn signals from
  our senses into a workable mental model of the universe, and choose an
  appropriate course of action. It is an extraordinary talent, but fallible,
  especially in conditions of sensory overload. That doesn’t mean we are
  incapable of handling perception of the world on an altered scale, or at much
  higher speeds. We can adapt to the tsunami of additional stimulus, just as we
  adapted to life in cities after centuries of rural subsistence. But such
  accelerated transitions are turbulent, stressful and usually violent.
  Information crises generate cosmological upheaval. They change the way
  humanity organises and views itself. Hierarchies tumble. Social norms are
  recoded. Morality is redefined. New philosophies are hatched. Gods are
  discarded. Under the circumstances, it isn’t surprising that democratic
  politics is struggling to adapt. How is one parliament on a small north
  Atlantic island supposed to impose new rules for the application of technology
  that spans the globe, dissolves national borders and vaporises the authority
  of analogue institutions? In the short period of my internet abstinence last
  month, long-delayed provisions of the Online Safety Act came into force.
  Social media platforms and search engines are now obliged to restrict underage
  users’ access to content listed as harmful by the new statute – abuse,
  pornography, material promoting self-harm, terrorism and suicide. Tech
  companies have lobbied ferociously against the change. Donald Trump’s White
  House characterises it as an assault on free speech. Nigel Farage agrees and
  promises to repeal the act if he ever forms a government. Labour ministers
  have said the Reform leader’s position aligns him with the interests of
  paedophiles. As a law-abiding adult user of social media, I cannot judge
  whether the new restrictions perform their advertised function. The
  age-verification process is efficient, painless and feels no more or less
  sinister than any of the other personal data submissions we now routinely make
  as the price for a frictionless internet. There are reported cases of
  non-pornographic news and public health sites being blocked by accident. There
  are claims that the protections are easily circumvented with a modicum of
  digital knowhow. It seems plausible that risk-averse or lazy tech companies
  are applying ill-designed, overzealous filters. But the impact on political
  liberty – the impediment to free speech that might justify some of the lurid
  comparisons being made to totalitarian censorship – is probably still in the
  order of zero. Of course, any instrument for policing flows of information
  contains the theoretical foundations of a more repressive agenda. A future
  government could redefine “harmful” content to include criticism of the
  government, for example, or anything that undermines traditional family
  values. Liberal defenders of the new law should not be complacent about its
  potential misuse. But its most vigorous critics, especially in the Trump
  administration, are not credible advocates of political liberty. The cause
  they advance is not free speech as a civic virtue. It is the commercial
  interest of companies that control much of the world’s digital information
  infrastructure. The system is awash with toxic material. Poison flows into the
  public realm and the pump’s owners deny responsibility, resisting regulation
  for the same reason that polluters have done since the Industrial Revolution.
  Because they can. Because their business is more profitable when someone else
  cleans up the mess. The Online Safety Act can be flawed and necessary at the
  same time. It is just a tiny skirmish in the early stages of the battle to
  decide how power is wielded and by whom in a world reordered by the
  information crisis. It is a faint but vital signal – a cry for help by
  analogue politicians drowning in digital noise. Rafael Behr is a Guardian
