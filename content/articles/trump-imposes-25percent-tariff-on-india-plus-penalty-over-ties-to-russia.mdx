  Donald Trump has announced the US will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India
  plus an extra “penalty” for the country buying arms and energy from Russia
  amid the war in Ukraine. Washington has set a 1 August deadline for countries
  around the world to reach agreements on trade, including India, amid the US
  president’s sweeping global tariff war. While saying that Delhi was a
  “friend,” Trump used his Truth Social platform to criticise India’s trade
  policies and said the White House would impose a 25% tariff “plus a penalty”
  of an unspecified amount. He said the US had a “massive” trade deficit with
  India – when imported goods outstrip exports – and linked its “vast” purchases
  of military equipment and energy from Russia to Vladimir Putin’s war in
  Ukraine. Criticising Indian tariffs applied to US imports as “far too high”,
  he also accused Narendra Modi’s government of applying non-monetary barriers
  to trade that were among the most “strenuous and obnoxious” in the world.
  Trump wrote: “They have always bought a vast majority of their military
  equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with
  China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE —
  ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! “INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A
  PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
  TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!” Trump doubled down in a subsequent post, saying: “I
  don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies
  down together, for all I care. “We have done very little business with India,
  their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. Likewise, Russia
  and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s keep it that way,” he wrote.
  Figures compiled by Washington show the US trade in goods with India were an
  estimated $129.2bn (£97bn) in 2024, making it the US’s 10th largest trading
  partner. The US goods trade deficit was worth $45.7bn. Shortly after
  announcing the tariffs on New Delhi, Trump said he had struck a deal with
  India’s neighbour and rival Pakistan to jointly develop its oil reserves. “Who
  knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India some day!” he posted on Truth
  Social. Trump’s criticism of India comes as he ramps up pressure on Moscow
  amid growing frustration with Putin’s war in Ukraine. Trump had claimed before
  his inauguration in January that he would be able to end the conflict within
  24 hours of taking office. Dozens of large countries around the world remain
  locked in negotiations with Washington with only days to go before Trump’s
  deadline of 1 August to reach agreements on trade. The White House has
  threatened to unilaterally apply higher tariffs if deals cannot be reached.
  Washington and Brussels reached a deal on Sunday to limit an increase in US
  tariffs on most EU goods to 15%, after Trump had threatened to apply a border
  charge of 30%. Deals have also been reached with Japan, Vietnam and the UK,
  while an agreement in principle has been reached to extend talks with China.
  Global investors have been monitoring closely amid hopes that damage to the
  world economy can be avoided after Trump’s 2 April “liberation day” plan sent
  shock waves through international markets.
