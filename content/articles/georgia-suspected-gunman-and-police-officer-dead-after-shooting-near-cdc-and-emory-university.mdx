  A suspected gunman and a police officer are dead after law enforcement
  responded to reports of an active shooter near the adjoining campuses of the
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta,
  Georgia, on Friday, authorities said. “It is with profound sadness that we
  announce the death of one of our very own DeKalb county police officers,” Greg
  Padrick, the county’s interim police chief, said at a news conference on
  Friday night. The name of the officer who was fatally shot while responding
  was not immediately released. The Atlanta police department, the FBI and the
  Georgia bureau of investigation are investigating the incident. No civilians
  are believed to have been injured, Darin Schierbaum, the Atlanta police chief,
  told reporters, but several rounds hit buildings on the CDC’s campus. The
  gunman was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the
  CDC and died at the scene, Schierbaum said. Atlanta police said just after
  6.40pm local time there was “no ongoing threat to the Emory campus or the
  surrounding neighborhood. The incident involved a single shooter, who is now
  deceased.” Emory University had alerted students and staff earlier to an
  active shooter on their Atlanta campus, telling students to “RUN, HIDE, FIGHT”
  and avoid the area. Just after 6.30pm local time, another update from the
  university advised students that “Shelter in place has been lifted”, but that
  the police emergency continued and they should avoid the area. Witnesses told
  local media that shots were fired near the Emory Point CVS, which is close to
  the university’s Atlanta campus and the CDC’s Roybal campus. Employees at the
  CDC said bullets struck the windows of several buildings on the federal
  agency’s campus. One CDC employee sent photographs to the local CBS News
  affiliate in Atlanta showing what appeared to be shattered glass from the
  impact of gunshots on a federal building. “Twice this week, deranged criminals
  have targeted innocent Georgians,” Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, said in a
  statement, referring to the new incident and the mass shooting at Fort Stewart
  military base in south-east Georgia on Wednesday. “Each time, brave first
  responders rushed toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives,
  reminding us of just how crucial they are. Marty, the girls, and I are
  thankful for all those who answer the call to serve and who protect their
  fellow Georgians. We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers,
  along with those harmed this evening near the CDC center.” Staff at a deli
  near campus locked the doors and hunkered down inside. Brandy Giraldo, the
  General Muir deli’s chief operating officer, said staffers inside heard a
  string of gunshots. “It sounded like fireworks going off, one right after the
  other,” she said. The Associated Press contributed reporting
