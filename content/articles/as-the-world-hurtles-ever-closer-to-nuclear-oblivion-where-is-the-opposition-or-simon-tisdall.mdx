  Nuclear weapons – their lethal menace, dark history and future spread – are
  back in the headlines again and, as usual, the news is worrying, bordering on
  desperate. Russia’s decision last week to formally abandon the 1987
  Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty banning medium- and short-range
  nuclear missiles completes the demolition of a key pillar of global arms
  control. It will accelerate an already frantic nuclear arms race in Europe and
  Asia at a moment when US and Russian leaders are taunting each other like
  schoolboys. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has repeatedly threatened the
  west with nuclear weapons during his war in Ukraine. Last November, Russian
  forces fired their new Oreshnik hypersonic, nuclear-capable intermediate-range
  missile at Dnipro. It travels “like a meteorite” at 10 times the speed of
  sound and can reach any city in Europe, Putin boasted – which, if true, is a
  clear INF violation. Moscow blames its decision to ditch the treaty on hostile
  Nato actions. Yet it has long bypassed it in practice, notably by basing
  missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic sea, and Belarus.
  That said, Russia has a point about Nato. Donald Trump first reneged on the
  INF treaty way back in 2018. The subsequent huge buildup of mainly US-produced
  nuclear-capable missiles, launchers, planes and bombs in European Nato states
  has understandably alarmed Moscow. It should alarm Europeans, too. In the
  1980s, deployments of US Pershing and cruise missiles sparked passionate
  protests across the continent. In contrast, today’s ominous tick-tocking of
  the Doomsday Clock, closer than ever to catastrophe at 89 seconds to midnight,
  is mostly accompanied by eerie silence. Trump’s melodramatic claim last week
  to have moved US nuclear submarines closer to Russia came in response to crude
  threats from the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a notorious Putin
  stooge. It was another chilling moment. But this puerile standoff will have
  served a useful purpose if it alerts slumbering European public opinion to the
  growing risk of nuclear confrontation. Maybe people have grown complacent;
  maybe they have too many other worries. Maybe governments such as Britain’s,
  suspected of secretly stashing US nuclear gravity bombs at an East Anglian
  airbase, are again failing to tell the truth. (The UK government refuses to
  say whether or not American nukes are now at RAF Lakenheath.) Whatever the
  reason, it falls to the children of the cold war – to the daughters of
  Greenham Common, to the heirs of ban-the-bomb protesters, to CND’s
  indefatigable campaigners – to more loudly warn: this way lies extinction. Yet
  why is it that they alone sound the tocsin? It’s all happening again, only
  this time it’s worse, and everyone’s a target. If unchecked, today’s vastly
  more powerful nukes could turn the planet into a universal killing field. Last
  week’s ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
  atomic bombings should be seen as a warning as well as a reminder. The nuclear
  weapons buildup in Europe proceeds apace. The US already stores nuclear bombs
  in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey. Now the UK, too, has
  offered facilities – and is buying nuclear-capable fighter jets. Germany will
  host Tomahawk cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles next year. The US is
  expanding missile bases in Poland and Romania. Nato countries such as Denmark
  and Norway have joined missile exercises aimed, for example, at establishing
  “control” of the Baltic. All this is justified in the name of self-defence,
  principally against Putin’s Russia. Likewise, Nato’s decision in June to raise
  national defence budgets to 5% of GDP. The global picture is no less
  disturbing. The nine nuclear-armed states – Britain, China, France, India,
  Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia and the US – spent $100.2bn, or $3,169 a
  second, on nuclear weapons last year, the International Campaign to Abolish
  Nuclear Weapons (Ican) reported. That’s up 11% on 2023. Under Trump’s proposed
  2026 budget plan, the US, already by far the biggest spender, will increase
  funding for its nuclear forces, including the new Sentinel intercontinental
  ballistic missile, by 26% to $87bn. Doing its bit for global insecurity, China
  has more than doubled its nuclear stockpile since 2020, to 500 warheads. Who
  can doubt where all this is leading? For the first time since the cold war,
  Europe, Asia and the Middle East are being transformed into potential nuclear
  battlegrounds, with the difference, now, that atomic bombs and missiles are
  viewed not as deterrents but as offensive, war-winning weapons. The
  proliferation of lower-yield, tactical warheads supposedly makes “limited”
  nuclear warfare possible. Once that red line is crossed, an unstoppable chain
  reaction may ensue. The collapse of arms-control agreements – the New
  Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) will be next to lapse in February
  2026 – is destroying safety nets. Signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation
  treaty are bound “in good faith” to gradually disarm; instead, they are
  rapidly rearming. Dehumanised AI systems may raise the risk of accidental
  Armageddon. Rogue states such as Israel and North Korea constantly push the
  boundaries. Trump’s impetuosity and Putin’s psychosis increase the sense of
  living in a global shooting gallery. It might have been very different. In
  June 1945, a group of University of Chicago nuclear physicists led by James
  Franck told President Harry Truman that an unannounced atomic bomb attack on
  Japan was “inadvisable”. Detonating the new weapon would trigger an
  uncontrollable worldwide arms race, they predicted. Their warnings were
  rejected, their report suppressed. Now, the UN is trying again. In line with
  the 2021 treaty outlawing nuclear weapons, a high-powered, international
  scientific panel was tasked last month with examining “the physical effects
  and societal consequences” of nuclear war “on a local, regional and planetary
  scale”. The challenge is formidable, the outcome uncertain. But someone,
  somehow, somewhere must call a halt to the madness. It is still just possible
  to hope that, unlike in 1945, wiser counsels will prevail. Simon Tisdall is a
