  The clothing company Shein said it has opened an internal investigation after
  its website briefly displayed a shirt listing featuring an image resembling
  Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing Brian Thompson, the CEO of
  UnitedHealthcare, in New York last year. The image appeared to show Mangione
  in a short-sleeved white shirt, and the top was reportedly priced at just
  under $10. In a statement shared with various media outlets, the company said:
  “The image in question was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed
  immediately upon discovery.” Exactly when and for how long the shirt was on
  sale is unclear, with Shein uploading thousands of products every day, but
  searches for “Luigi Mangione Shein” on Google spiked on Tuesday and the
  listing began circulating across social media. An archived posting of the
  product description for the “Men’s New Spring/Summer Short Sleeve Blue Ditsy
  Floral White Shirt” shows the item was nearly sold out, with only one size
  left in stock. Mangione, 27, was arrested last December and charged in
  connection with the fatal shooting of Thompson. In April, he pleaded not
  guilty to all federal counts, including murder and stalking, and awaits trial.
  Prosecutors have announced they will pursue the death penalty if he is found
  guilty. After the killing, some people opposed to the US healthcare system
  framed Mangione as a folk hero, with some rallying outside the courthouse
  during his appearances and contributing thousands of dollars to Mangione’s
  defense fund. Others have condemned the glorifying of violence and
  vigilantism. Some online retailers, including Etsy, saw a wave of merchandise
  using his name. Amazon said it had removed any such products from its site.
  Shein, founded in China, has built its global reputation on inexpensive,
  fast-moving fashion trends that attract gen Zers and younger millennials. The
  company has also faced repeated criticism over labor practices, including
  allegations of forced labor that the company has denied, as well as scrutiny
  for its environmental footprint. A spokesperson for Shein said: “We have
  stringent standards for all listings on our platform. We are conducting a
  thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take
  appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies.” The latest
  incident comes as the EU justice commissioner, Michael McGrath, vowed to crack
  down on the sale of goods that break the law. He expressed shock at the
  dangers of some goods being sold by China-linked online marketplaces such as
  Shein and its main rival, Temu. Shein said at the time that it was “fully
  committed to ensuring the products we offer are safe and compliant”, while
  Temu said it had a “system of seller vetting, proactive monitoring and
  responsive takedowns to prevent, detect and remove unsafe products”.
  Meanwhile, the UK is reviewing rules that allow goods worth less than £135 and
  sent direct to a buyer to enter the UK without paying customs duty. The US
  recently scrapped its version of the “de minimis” rules, which allowed goods
  worth less than $800 and sent direct to American shoppers to escape customs
  duty and some checks. Shein had hoped to list on the London Stock Exchange
  this year, valued at as much as £50bn ($67bn). However, it is now thought to
  be pursuing a listing in Hong Kong after failing to win approval from Chinese
  authorities for a listing in the UK. British MPs and investors have also
  raised questions about conditions in the group’s supply chain.
