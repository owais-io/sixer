  The Great Art Fraud 9pm, BBC Two An art gallery wunderkind. A Made in Chelsea
  girlfriend. An $86m (£64m) art fraud that led to two years in prison. Inigo
  Philbrick, who was released last year, tells his story in this two-parter that
  unpicks how he sold the same paintings to multiple people at once. It also
  speaks to industry insiders and his now wife (Made in Chelsea’s) Victoria
  Baker-Harber. Here’s hoping he’s not going for Anna Delvey-style scam icon
  status, because he is quite unbearable. Hollie Richardson Saving Lives at Sea
  8pm, BBC Two The salutary tale of two overambitious amateur kayakers at
  Crantock in Cornwall is just the warmup this week for scary tales of the south
  coast when storms are raging. Later in Mudeford, a call comes in from a boy
  concerned about his windsurfing dad. Out at sea, the man has vanished. Jack
  Seale George Clarke’s Beautiful Builds 8pm, Channel 4 Another slightly
  bewildering dilemma: the kitchen and garden will be renovated, but the
  homeowners need to choose which gets a bigger budget. This time, in
  Derbyshire, wheelchair user Ben wants better accessibility in both spaces, and
  a design that works for the whole family. HR Destination X 9pm, BBC One So
  far, the BBC’s reality travel gameshow has varied from wrenching more gripping
  drama than you’d imagine possible from an, essentially, elaborate geography
  quiz to absolutely stultifying TV (what was that Venice episode about?). This
  week, the final four contestants battle it out in the penultimate episode –
  before Thursday’s final. Alexi Duggins Mudtown 9pm, U&amp;Alibi “Model?
  Richmond fucking sausage lips more like” might be the greatest insult ever
  hurled across a courtroom. But that’s not even dedicated magistrate Claire’s
  (Erin Richards) main case. She is taking the investigation of the arson a
  family friend has been accused of into her own hands – however, it goes much
  deeper than she realised. HR Limbs in the Loch: Catching a Killer 10pm, BBC
  Two A sensitive six-part documentary about a macabre case: the discovery of
  human limbs in Loch Lomond in December 1999, and a head that washed up on a
  South Ayrshire beach just over a week later. The story of the investigation is
  told here, starting with police doing a routine exercise in the loch with no
  expectation of finding anything in it. HR Film choice Thunderbolts* (Jake
  Shreier, 2025), Disney+ Calling its supervillain “Bob” suggests this entry in
  the Marvel Cinematic Universe has its tongue at least occasionally in its
  cheek. And, with Florence Pugh and David Harbour reprising their semi-comic
  roles from Black Widow as Yelena and Alexei, it’s a fun, if breathless, caper.
  Chuck in Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), disgraced former
  Captain America John Walker (Wyatt Russell) and Hannah John-Kamen’s Ghost and
  you have a new set of crime-fighting heroes ready to go. Simon Wardell The
  Claim (Michael Winterbottom, 2000), midnight, Talking Pictures TV The snow in
  the Sierra Nevada can bury a lot of things, but in Michael Winterbottom’s
  weighty version of Thomas Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge, it can’t keep the
  past covered for ever. Peter Mullan is at his brooding best as Dillon, the
  benevolent dictator of 1860s gold-mining settlement Kingdom Come. But two
  arrivals spell doom. There’s surveyor Dalglish (Wes Bentley) who may – or may
  not – send the railroad through his town; and there’s his wife, Elena,
  (Nastassja Kinski), and their daughter Hope (Sarah Polley), whom Dillon sold
  for a gold claim years earlier … SW
