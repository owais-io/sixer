  Ruby Tui was the player everyone was talking about when New Zealand’s Rugby
  World Cup squad was announced last month but not for the reason fans may have
  expected. The 33-year-old had not made the squad but, as is her nature, Tui is
  determined to turn her omission into a positive. “I do want young players to
  know selection doesn’t get easy,” she says. “But also it is team first, always
  and 100% of the time, especially when it’s hard.” The star of New Zealand’s
  2022 World Cup-winning squad, who has also won Olympic gold and silver, and
  the Sevens World Cup, Tui was squeezed out by competition in the back three
  with Ayesha Leti-I’iga and Portia Woodman‑Wickliffe getting the nod. While
  acknowledging that being left out was difficult, Tui’s focus is firmly on
  supporting the Black Ferns. “Everyone can be team first when it’s easy,” Tui
  says. “I think it is a cool opportunity for me to say I totally love and
  respect this team, which I absolutely and wholeheartedly do. I support
  everything. I am gunning for my team. I want players who are struggling with
  selection to see that and know you do get to a point where you are OK with it.
  “I have played for New Zealand since 2012 and I have won a World Cup, I have
  won an Olympics, I feel like it could have been a lot harder for other people.
  I am not the only one who didn’t make the team, I felt like there was a lot of
  hype around me but that doesn’t [mean it] hurt any less or any more. “There’s
  a lot of people who went through that at the same time, not just for New
  Zealand, there are a lot of people who missed out on this and it can be
  really, really hard. But I do want to show people I still feel a part of my
  team, I have been a part of it for a long time and I feel a part of the
  family.” Tui had made clear that if she were not selected she would want to be
  part of this groundbreaking World Cup in any capacity, and has landed several
  media jobs for the tournament – one as a BBC pundit. Tui sees that as a
  full‑circle moment after she went viral at the 2020 Olympics after a colourful
  BBC interview with Jill Douglas. Tui leans back, a beaming smile spreading
  across her face before her eyes squeeze shut with laughter as she remembers
  the interview, saying she did not realise it was live at the time. “We should
  reenact it,” she says of a potential reunion with Douglas in England. Tui
  debuted on the BBC for England’s opening win against USA alongside Gabby
  Logan, the former England head coach Simon Middleton and the former England
  player Maggie Alphonsi. Tui has had glowing reviews and says: “It felt right
  being there. It was a really fascinating experience. “In New Zealand, there’s
  a couple of people there but I think the viewership [on Friday] was like 2.5
  million or something which is half the population of the country I live in, so
  it was all quite surreal. I was very happy to be there. “It’s difficult to
  articulate how much it [being free-to-air] means to me. Everyday people, no
  matter where you come from or what you are up to, can watch these games. It’s
  truly magic, it’s truly real‑life magic that the Women’s Rugby World Cup, the
  greatest teams in the world, world record‑breakers, can be viewed by anyone
  who turns on their TV.” After the opening game, Tui travelled to York to cover
  New Zealand’s first match against Spain. The Black Ferns won 54-8 but Kaipo
  Olsen-Baker, Amy du Plessis and Leti-I’iga were injured, something Tui was
  “gutted” to see. New Zealand next face Japan on Sunday and having “got the job
  done with a bonus-point win” against Spain despite the injuries, Tui says they
  are not a team you to be underestimated. “Japan might not have the same speed
  or size but man they are fit. If you switch off for five minutes Japan will
  completely turn the game around and you will be down the other end of the
  field, as Ireland found out. It’s good New Zealand had a little peek at that
  game. It’s a reminder you can’t take Japan lightly at all, so I am really
  looking forward to it.” What is next for Tui as a player? While she did not
  confirm any specifics, there may be opportunities in Premiership Women’s
  Rugby. “I went into my DMs and there’s Saracens, Harlequins. I was like: ‘Is
  this what happens? Is this how it goes?’ I might go through some of my inbox
  and see what is going on. I don’t know, I have always lived my life and career
  with whatever feels good. If it feels right and it’s a bunch of mates and
  we’re going to have fun, like, yeah … but there’s so much going on right now
  [in terms of her career next steps]. It does seem like a sick competition, I
  do watch it … I’ll have to chat to Ilona [Maher, the USA international and
  former Bristol Bear] and see how she liked it.” Though absent from the World
  Cup squad, Tui’s presence remains undeniable. Whether that is through her
  sharp punditry, inspiration on and off the field, or her try-scoring ability,
  she is far from finished shaping the future of rugby.
