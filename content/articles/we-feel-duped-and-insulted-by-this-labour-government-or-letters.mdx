  Lord Falconer’s assessment of the government (Starmer’s team seen as ‘tired,
  same-again politicians’, says Labour peer, 9 August) does not acknowledge the
  depth of feeling on current issues, and his advice for the future is itself
  “same-again” and “tired”. After the last general election, Keir Starmer
  promised us hope and an assurance that the “broadest shoulders” would help to
  turn around the country after 14 years of disastrous and deeply damaging
  Conservative rule. However, the public clearly didn’t think that axing
  disabled people’s benefits or removing heating allowances from pensioners
  fitted the “broadest shoulders” definition. Rather large “fuck-ups”, as
  Falconer puts it, in a handful of weeks. The pro-Israel, pro-US foreign policy
  agenda, while a terrible genocide unfolds in Gaza, has also proved deeply
  unpalatable. The public feel duped and insulted by this “blue” Labour
  government, with its unashamedly authoritarian assault on democracy. I agree
  with the “same old, same old” sentiment: same lower- and middle-income earners
  paying the same price for the same old financiers, political lobbyists,
  rightwing campaign groups, global corporations, arms manufacturers and their
  vested interests. Yes, the 10-year NHS plan is welcome, but the failure to tax
  the super-rich and initiatives such as the environmentally catastrophic
  planning reforms outweigh any positive steps. Falconer suggests No 10 should
  unapologetically drive through ideological change, but that approach is
  doomed. Less of the tone-deafness and failure to read the room, and more
  consultation, more humanity, are what the people want. Sue Borges Stowmarket,
  Suffolk • Charles Falconer’s critique of Labour in government sums up the
  situation very well. I would just add that disillusionment and absence of hope
  combine to make this an unhappy, uneasy country. Yet our government apparently
  fails to see any link with increasing polarisation, conflict and crime. It’s
  proving a costly failure for us all, but especially for the people who are
  marginalised and vulnerable. We should expect better. Paula Jones London
