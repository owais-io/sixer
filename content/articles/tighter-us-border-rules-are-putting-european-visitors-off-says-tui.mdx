  Tighter border rules are putting European tourists off holidaying in the US,
  according to Europe’s biggest package trip operator. Tui’s chief executive,
  Sebastian Ebel, said there had been a “significant decline” in travel to the
  US, due to a multitude of factors including “the atmosphere, what you hear
  from border control”. He said European tourists were opting instead to visit
  Canada and other long-haul destinations such as Africa and Asia. The comments
  from Tui’s chief executive follow a string of reports of Europeans and other
  foreigners with valid visas for the US facing interrogation, detainment and
  deportation, including a British tourist, three Germans, a Canadian and an
  Australian who were each held and then deported. Sarah Shaw, from New Zealand,
  and her six-year-old son, who live in the US, are being held at a US
  immigration centre after they were detained crossing the Canada-US border.
  Donald Trump’s administration plans to impose bonds – some as high as $15,000
  for some tourism and business visas. It also plans a $250 “visa integrity fee”
  for visitors. Asked about the changes, Ebel said: “I expect that the impact
  will be seen, and this policy will change. Will it change in three months,
  will it change in three years? I have no idea.” Tui’s report of a decline in
  US travel by its customers comes as figures have highlighted a sharp fall in
  overall tourism to the country in recent months; the industry is expected to
  lose out on billions of dollars this year as a result of government actions.
  Travel from Canada and Mexico in 2025 has fallen by 20% compared with last
  year, according to the US Travel Association. Ebel played down the
  significance of the fall to Tui, saying its US business was “not of essence
  for us. It’s a nice long-haul business, good margins, but it’s not in the
  order of magnitude, not a big thing.” Ebel said customers would choose to
  visit places where there was “seamless travel” and called for travel between
  the UK and the EU to be made easier. British visitors are allowed to use
  e-gates but they still have to get their passports stamped until at least
  October because of Brexit restrictions. Ebel said: “I’m so happy that there’s
  seamless travel for me as a German, to Spain, to Greece. I would wish that it
  would be the same seamlessness to the UK. “It’s not seamless, and that’s not
  good for the UK, and it’s not good for Europe either.” Tui reported a 2% fall
  in summer bookings as a result of conflict in the Middle East, but said ticket
  prices were 3% higher, helping to balance out higher costs. A summer of
  heatwaves across Europe, and current extremely high temperatures across
  south-west France, Croatia, Italy and Spain, are also causing more
  holidaymakers to travel either ahead of, or after, the peak summer period, in
  what travel companies call the “shoulder season”, which usually refers to
  March-May and September-October. Ebel said this shift gave the company a “good
  outlook”, as the trend for customers travelling at other times of year and not
  just during the school summer holidays gave it more resilience. Tui increased
  its full-year profit guidance on Tuesday, following strong demand for stays in
  its hotels and for its cruises. Its shares rose more than 6%. Tui reported
  underlying pre-tax profit of €321m (£277m) between April and June, ahead of
  analysts’ forecasts, and 38% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier as
  it benefited from the late timing of Easter.
