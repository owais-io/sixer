  Something big is about to happen to households across England. Exhausted
  parents at the playground, wild-eyed as they respond to work emails while
  their kids charge past with anarchic abandon, gather their final ounces of
  energy. “Liberation day is coming,” they whisper. Finally, after six weeks of
  summer holidays, the kids are going back to school. But my own heady
  excitement at regaining some semblance of routine come September has been
  derailed by an adjacent exercise: procuring my daughter’s first school
  uniform. Call me curmudgeonly, but there’s few things I resent more than
  spending more than £300 to dress my four-year-old in a suit and tie. The
  British obsession with forcing children into business attire from an age when
  they can’t yet read or write is surely a form of national delirium. School
  uniform undoubtedly has worthy roots. It has prevailed in most schools since
  the 19th century, when it was introduced as a means to reduce the appearance
  of socioeconomic disparities and create a sense of community and cohesion. But
  can we say with any conviction that uniforms in their current tradition still
  do that? So extortionate they have become that some parents in England are
  skipping meals and turning to buy now, pay later services such as Klarna to
  afford them before the autumn term, according to a survey by the parenting
  charity Parentkind. At the small, south London state primary my daughter
  attends, the blazer alone costs £38. The branded cardigan, made of 50%
  acrylic, is £23. These, alongside the other compulsory items on the school’s
  list, must be bought from one specialist uniform supplier. Delivery is another
  £8. Ordered the wrong size? That’s a shame – returns are at your expense,
  unless you would rather go to the physical store, a mere 45 minutes and two
  train rides away in the neighbouring borough of Croydon. The school’s
  secondhand uniform shop thrives but is a victim of its own success – only the
  most organised can snap up the available stock in the required sizes before it
  sells out before the summer term is even over. It’s almost like the whole
  process has been designed to ramp up your blood pressure by 10 points.
  Government messaging says schools should make uniforms affordable and work
  with families who struggle to afford them. But there is no benchmark to say
  how they should be priced, nor any set rules that schools have to abide by.
  Indeed, some schools ask for as many as 10 branded items, pushing the cost of
  a child’s uniform with PE kit up to £400. The government recognises the
  problem – it has plans to limit branded student kit to three articles, plus a
  tie, from September 2026 in England, and the education secretary, Bridget
  Phillipson, has urged schools to bring in reasonable measures beforehand. “You
  don’t need a posh blazer to learn your times tables, and Shakespeare is just
  as inspiring in a supermarket sweater,” she wrote on X. I couldn’t agree more
  – especially when said blazer will probably be lost in the first week of term.
  Friends tell me they uphold a quiet form of resistance. One says that after
  her five-year-old lost his blazer twice in a row, she simply refused to
  replace it until the following year and ignored the headteacher’s protests.
  But in other parts of the country, it has become commonplace to hear stories
  of children being excluded for not wearing the correct uniform. I can’t help
  but wonder if these incidents could have been avoided if schools simply had
  more accommodating rules. And of course, enforcing dress codes falls to our
  notoriously time-rich teachers – as if teaching in 2025 doesn’t already give
  them enough to contend with. There is an argument that uniforms help to drive
  up standards, that being smartly dressed encourages a level of engagement with
  education. Or, for schools in big cities struggling to attract pupils, maybe
  it’s a way for them to stand out – a form of advertising their high standards.
  Private school-inspired uniform must appeal to some socially ambitious
  parents. But research on the impact of uniforms is mixed. “There is little
  robust evidence that introducing a school uniform will, by itself, improve
  academic performance, behaviour, or attendance,” says the Education Endowment
  Foundation. And however much uniforms have been modernised, they remain
  heavily gendered. New research from the University of Cambridge found school
  uniform policies could even be restricting young people from being active,
  particularly primary school-age girls. Anecdotal evidence suggests most
  uniforms are made from synthetic materials, chock full of forever chemicals
  that are breathed in when our children get hot. As our climate becomes more
  unpredictable and our school buildings suddenly feel woefully unfit to cope
  with the changing temperatures, it feels more important than ever that our
  children are dressed comfortably and that the fabrics they wear are not just
  breathable but also sustainable. Despite my protests, I’m not arguing for
  uniform to be abolished. Who could dislike its practicality on already chaotic
  school mornings? And I think they do achieve something unquantifiable in
  fostering a sense of community and cohesion. But here is my plea for reason:
  make them affordable, sustainable, and while we’re here make them easy to get
  hold of, replace and clean. At the heart of this issue is an existential
  question: what is school for? For children to develop and learn? Or to mould
  them in a one-dimensional way? Today we accept that success and achievement
  can look many different ways. And it doesn’t always come dressed in a suit and
  tie. Lucy Pasha-Robinson is an assistant editor on Guardian Opinion
