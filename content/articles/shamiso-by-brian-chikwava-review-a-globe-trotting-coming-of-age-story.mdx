  In the opening chapters of Zimbabwean author Brian Chikwava’s follow-up to his
  2009 debut Harare North, the eponymous teen protagonist is given a pendant by
  an elder of the family, the irrepressible Babamukuru Jimson. “A stone carving
  of Nyami Nyami, the River God, the spirit snake. My first instinct was fear
  that one day I would break it. It looked fragile, a needle of stone with Nyami
  Nyami’s serpentine body coiled up and gathered at the top, where instead of a
  snake’s head, a fierce fish’s head sprung out bearing sharp teeth. It was
  surprisingly heavy. I wore it straight away. A snake with a fish’s head. It
  was a strange form, as if all life forms were connected and fluid in their
  existence. No one had ever given me anything like this before.” It’s telling
  that Chikwava’s usually peppy narration slows to scrutinise this keepsake. The
  pendant is an emblem of Shamiso’s twisty, mixed path from girlhood to
  womanhood, a path reminiscent in places of both NoViolet Bulawayo’s We Need
  New Names and Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions. This curious talisman
  represents, too, her contrarian nature. “Why can’t you be like other girls?”
  Shamiso’s father shouts, after she’s been insubordinate at school. It’s a
  question the novel attempts to tackle throughout. This vibrant, sometimes
  surreal picaresque begins in a post-independence Zimbabwe. The country is
  fissured by suspicion and social unrest. Disquiet marks Shamiso’s family life,
  too: she has been abandoned by her unstable mother, who “lives for the bar and
  carries a brick in her bag”. She lives instead with her remote father, a
  former soldier whose desire for orderliness is at odds with Shamiso’s dreamier
  sensibilities. There is a striking, phantasmagoric scene in which, dusty and
  disoriented, Shamiso doggedly climbs mountains outside Harare, illustrative of
  her pursuit of an ineffable promise of something beyond the strictures of her
  sterile home life. Jimson, her Falstaffian, spirited elderly relative, is a
  self-taught artisan who nurtures Shamiso’s creative yearnings. Her hopes to
  give freer rein to this more imaginative part of herself are seemingly
  realised when she gets the chance to study art at the University of Brighton
  in England. The short novel bounds through Shamiso’s fish-out-of-water campus
  experiences and her attempts to settle herself into a bewildering new world
  with a host family. We also follow her post-graduation life as she scratches a
  living as a sculptor in London, producing works that she hopes possess the
  mystique and force of Nyami Nyami. It is a commonplace of the Bildungsroman
  that the lead’s self‑discovery is accelerated by encounters with educative
  external characters. In the earlier part of the novel, this function is
  fulfilled by vivacious Jimson. With his hare-brained get-rich quick schemes
  and hot temper, he is a highlight of the novel. In the Brighton section,
  Chikwava seems to imply that non-binary George will take on this
  horizon-expanding role. Together they drift through Brighton’s bars and clubs;
  George has a penchant for drag that is “wild, colourful, fun, scary, bold and
  fearful”. The implication is that George is a kind of incarnation of Nyami
  Nyami’s brilliant, powerful strangeness. I write with a general tentativeness
  here because George’s portrayal and, more broadly, the connection between the
  protagonist and George was one of a number of uncertainties I had about the
  novel. George is described as a “terrific human being”, but I wasn’t sure that
  the writing helped me believe in their charisma at all. Lost on me, too, were
  the stakes and status of a romantic relationship that blurs in and out of
  focus. When considering what exactly is going on between herself and George,
  Shamiso declares: “We understand each other, I think”. That equivocation was
  something I felt too and couldn’t get past when mulling over what held these
  characters together. The disjointed shape of the novel also puzzled me. While
  flinty concision is much praised at the moment, this book could have done with
  being fleshed out more, not least to enrich the relationship between George
  and Shamiso. Halfway through, Shamiso exults that she “loves life and makes
  fast, flash friendships even though [she] cannot hold a thought in [her] head
  for longer than five seconds”; the odd pace and proportions of the novel
  attest to this. Jimson seems to be a central character, but is wrested from
  the narrative far too soon. The depiction of Shamiso’s schooldays, especially
  when she is exiled to boarding school by her father – the eventual springboard
  for her life-changing voyage abroad – is compressed and truncated. In the
  final third, a modelling scam arises that seems like an important plot twist;
  but this soon fizzles out. Shamiso also stages a risky, seemingly impactful
  protest in the midst of a gallery opening but this ultimately proves to be
  fairly inconsequential, too. While there is often an admirable audacity in
  Chikwava’s original prose style – drily funny in its pinpointing of British
  racism; sensually imagistic in its capturing of juvenile scrapes in Harare –
  like the chimerical Nyami Nyami, this novel is a mixed bag. • Shamiso by Brian
  Chikwava is published by Canongate (£12.99). To support the Guardian order
