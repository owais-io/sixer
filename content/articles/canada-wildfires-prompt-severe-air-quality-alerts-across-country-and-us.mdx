  Billowing smoke from hundreds of out-of-control wildfires – most of which are
  in the Canadian Prairies – have caused severe air quality alerts across Canada
  and the United States. Detroit, Michigan, and the Canadian cities of Montreal
  and Toronto, recorded some of the worst air quality in the world on Monday,
  according to a ranking by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company. More
  than 700 active wildfires are currently burning across Canada and about
  two-thirds of them are now out-of-control, according to the Canadian
  Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), a non-profit organization that is
  owned by government agencies. One brush fire, in British Columbia, was
  reportedly caused when an osprey dropped a fish on to a power line, sparking a
  small blaze which was later extinguished. But most of the current fires that
  are causing the poor, smoggy air quality and reduced visibility are connected
  to warmer-than-average temperatures, drought conditions, decreased levels of
  snowpack and low soil moisture, according to Natural Resources Canada. All of
  those factors are driven by global heating, NRC says. Some others, including
  one discovered Thursday on the banks of Cameron Lake in British Columbia, were
  human-caused, according to officials. Monica Vaswani, a warning preparedness
  meteorologist with Environment Canada, said this year is shaping up to be a
  “particularly bad wildfire season”. “This is not unlike what we’ve been seeing
  in the last few years … unfortunately it’s kind of becoming a little bit more
  the norm,” she said. Vulnerable populations, including elderly people,
  children and those with respiratory or heart issues have been advised to
  reduce time outdoors in Toronto and the surrounding municipalities. There is a
  risk for the general population as well and indoor activities are recommended,
  said Vaswani. So far this year, 6,625,375 hectares of land in Canada have
  burned due to fires, which is about 140% higher than the same date in 2024
  when 2,785,140 hectares were burned, according to the CIFFC. The fires have
  also resulted in several evacuations across Canada in the last week. In
  northern Manitoba, a full evacuation order was issued for the Nisichawayasihk
  Cree Nation due to wildfires. More than 400 properties have been ordered to
  vacate as a result on the east coast of Vancouver Island – and the fire is
  180km north-west of Victoria, British Columbia. The Saskatchewan village of
  Pinehouse, located about 500km north of the city of Saskatoon, also was under
  an evacuation order this week. The largest fires in the country are now across
  the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with several larger than 100,000
  hectares. The smoke from those fires continues to drift down across the
  Canadian border with the United States. On Monday, air quality alerts were
  issued for Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, parts of Nebraska and regions
  in Illinois and Indiana. People in the eastern states of New York, Vermont,
  New Hampshire and Maine are also being advised by officials to limit outdoor
  activity due to the wildfires. • This article was amended on 6 August 2025. So
  far this year 6,625,375 hectares of land in Canada have been burned by
  wildfires, not sq metres as an earlier version said. That is about 140% more
  than at the same date in 2024, not 82% more than all of 2024. There were
  2,785,140 hectares burned in the year to date, not 2,785,140 sq metres in
  2024. It is British Columbia, not British Colombia. Also, the fire is 180km
  north-west of Victoria, not 80km.
