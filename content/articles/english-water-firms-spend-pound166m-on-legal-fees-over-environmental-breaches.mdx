  English water companies have spent £16.6m fighting legal action against
  regulators and campaigners over environmental breaches such as illegal sewage
  spills. Correspondence from the companies to the Commons environment, food and
  rural affairs (Efra) committee published on Tuesday reveals that millions of
  pounds of bill payers’ money has been spent over the past five years on
  expensive external lawyers enlisted to reduce liabilities for regulatory
  breaches. Helena Dollimore, the Labour MP for Hastingsand Rye and a member of
  the committee said: “As our water pipes have been left to crumble into
  disrepair with vital maintenance delayed, the water companies have wasted
  millions on expensive legal firms tasked with downplaying the extent of the
  sewage scandal. “My constituents will be outraged by what our committee has
  uncovered. That money should be spent fixing our broken water infrastructure
  not trying to deny the scale of the problem.” Top of the list is Thames Water,
  which incurred £7,528,266.40 in such legal fees over the past five years –
  £5,002,664.26 on enforcement of regulatory breaches by Ofwat, £2,451,177.47
  contesting Environment Agency investigations and £74,424.67 contesting fines
  from the Drinking Water Inspectorate. The debt-ridden company is currently
  pleading with the government to be let off fines and costs to prevent it
  falling into special administration. It chief executive, Chris Weston,
  recently told the Efra committee that overall regulatory liabilities could
  reach £1bn over the current price review period. Ofwat imposed a record £104m
  fine on Thames Water in May over environmental breaches involving sewage
  spills, after it failed to operate and manage its treatment works and
  wastewater networks effectively. A further £18.2m fine was levied for breaking
  dividend rules, the first penalty of its kind in the water industry. Ofwat
  said the company had paid out cash to investors despite having fallen short in
  its services to customers and its environmental record. Water companies have
  also spent money contesting claims from local people and campaigners. South
  West Water, for example, spent £17,380 spent challenging five loss-of-amenity
  claims initiated by customers over the five-year period. Southern Water spent
  £2.6m on external legal fees relating to seven regulatory actions. In all of
  them, the company said it had pleaded guilty as “early as possible”. “In
  accordance with our obligations under the sentencing guidelines [we] have
  engaged external legal counsel to act on our behalf to provide the courts with
  information on culpability, harm, aggravating factors, mitigation and other
  relevant matters,” it said. It was announced in March Yorkshire Water would
  pay a £40m fine after an Ofwat investigation found the company had discharged
  wastewater for an average of seven hours a day in 2023, with almost half of
  the sewage spills in breach of regulations that only allow dumping in
  exceptional circumstances such as extreme weather events. The documents
  disclose that the company spent £1.7m on solicitors’ fees during this
  investigation. company. The water companies have been contacted for comment.
