  Victoria’s mountain ash forests are thinning rapidly as the globe heats up,
  and could lose a quarter of their “giant” trees that grow up to 80m tall in
  the coming decades, research has found. Forests of Eucalyptus regnans – one of
  the tallest tree species in the world – lose about 9% of their trees for every
  degree of warming, according to a University of Melbourne-led study published
  in Nature Communications. “These are giants,” said lead author Dr Raphael
  Trouve. “They are the tallest flowering plant on Earth – that means they
  regularly reach 60 to 80m tall.” Sign up to get climate and environment editor

  data collected from mountain ash forests over more than 50 years to determine
  tree mortality rates and forest carrying capacity – the maximum number of
  trees of a given size that the forest can sustain. They found that forests
  growing in the warmest conditions had the lowest carrying capacity, which
  further decreased with rising temperatures. “We found that for each extra
  degree of temperature, the number of trees that the forest can sustain drops
  by 9%,” Trouve said. “By 2080 – with three extra degrees, as we expect – that
  tallies up to around a quarter of the trees gone.” The estimated forest loss
  did not include the additional impact of bushfires, which are expected to grow
  in severity as the planet warms up. The forest thinning was thought to be the
  result of increased competition for limited resources. “A growing tree needs
  space and resources to survive,” Trouve said. “Under resource-limited
  conditions, such as water stress, a big tree will outcompete smaller,
  surrounding trees, causing their deaths.” Changes in forest carrying capacity
  would probably have knock-on effects. “Its not just about trees, it’s about
  the carbon they store, the planet we need, the water we drink,” he said.
  Mountain ash forests are considered one of the Earth’s most carbon-dense
  ecosystems, storing more carbon per hectare than the Amazon. But as more trees
  died and decomposed, the forests would eventually shift from carbon sinks into
  sources of emissions, the study said. “Climate change is stressing forests all
  over the world, and that can be exacerbating the rate of thinning” said Dr
  David Bowman, a professor of fire science at the University of Tasmania with a
  background in eucalypt ecology, who was not involved in the study. Bowman said
  climate change – and the combination of heatwaves, rising temperatures and
  chronic droughts – was placing forests under enormous stress globally, and
  particularly affected those in mid-latitude, temperate environments. Giant
  trees were particularly vulnerable. “They’re getting exhausted,” he said.
  Then, as forests were dying and thinning, they became more open and more
  flammable, as fuel – in the form of leaf matter, litter, fine branches and
  stems – accumulated in the forest. The risk of bushfire then became a
  “nightmare scenario” for large trees – already struggling to survive – which
  would struggle to recover.
