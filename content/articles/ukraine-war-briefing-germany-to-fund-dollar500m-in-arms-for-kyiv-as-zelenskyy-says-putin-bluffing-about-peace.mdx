  Putin ‘bluffing’ about peace

  Germany plans to fund a $500m package of military equipment and munitions for
  Ukraine sourced from the US, Nato said on Wednesday. Alliance chief Mark Rutte
  commended Germany for the decision, saying: “This delivery will help Ukraine
  defend itself against Russian aggression.” Germany’s foreign and defence
  ministries said the support was focused on equipment such as “critical air
  defence capabilities” against Russian airstrikes that were “killing more and
  more civilians throughout Ukraine”. The Netherlands and Sweden have also
  pledged major contributions. Germany’s move came as Donald Trump said there
  would be “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin did not agree to stop
  his war in Ukraine after the summit between the US and Russian presidents in
  Alaska this Friday. The US president’s comment came after a virtual meeting
  with European leaders including Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who
  told the group that Putin “is bluffing” about seeking peace. “He is trying to
  apply pressure before the meeting in Alaska along all parts of the Ukrainian
  front,” Zelenskyy said, amid a sharp thrust from Russian forces into eastern
  Ukraine in recent days. “Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of
  Ukraine,” he said. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said the leaders had a
  “constructive and good” discussion with Trump. Keir Starmer is to welcome
  Zelenskyy to London on Thursday, the British prime minister’s office has said.
  On Wednesday, the prime minister said there was now a “viable” chance for a
  Ukraine ceasefire, and that Ukraine’s military backers – the so-called
  coalition of the willing – had drawn up workable military plans in case of a
  ceasefire, but were also ready to add pressure on Russia through sanctions.
  “For three and a bit years this conflict has been going, we haven’t got
  anywhere near ... a viable way of bringing it to a ceasefire,” Starmer told
  the European meeting. “Now we do have that chance, because of the work that
  the [US] president has put in.” Trump suggested he would push for a second
  summit if his meeting with Putin went well – this time including Zelenskyy,
  reports Patrick Wintour. “If the first one goes OK, we’ll have a quick second
  one,” Trump told reporters in Washington. “I would like to do it almost
  immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and
  President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to have me there.” Trump’s
  remarks followed what he described as a very good call with the European
  leaders in which he consulted about the goal and strategy for his summit. He
  pleased Europe’s leadership by giving reassurances that a ceasefire was his
  priority and he would not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full
  involvement. Russia wants to include the topic of a reduction in Nato troops’
  presence in any conversations about the future of Ukraine, the Polish prime
  minister said. Donald Tusk told reporters on Wednesday: “That is why it is so
  important that we build such a strong and united group of states, both in
  relation to Russia but also in relation to other allies, like the United
  States.” Fallen debris from Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an oil refinery
  in the Russian city of Volgograd, the governor said on Thursday. “Firefighters
  quickly began extinguishing the fire,” Andrey Bocharov, the governor, said on
  Telegram. “According to preliminary data, there were no casualties.” Russia’s
  defence ministry said air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed 44
  Ukrainian drones overnight, including nine over the Volgograd region. Russian
  hackers briefly took control of a dam in Norway earlier this year, the
  country’s counter-intelligence agency chief said on Wednesday, the first time
  Oslo has officially attributed the cyberattack to its neighbour. While in
  command of the dam in Bremanger, western Norway, on 7 April, the hackers
  opened a flood gate and released 500 litres (132 gallons) of water a second
  for four hours before the attack was detected and stopped, authorities
  previously said. No one was injured. The UK’s spy chief accused Russia in
  September last year of waging a “staggeringly reckless campaign” of sabotage
  in Europe, partly to scare European countries from helping Ukraine. Moscow
  denies the allegation.
