  Chelsea have a gold badge on the shirt for the next four years but they had
  lead in their boots for much of their opening game. This was a flat start to a
  possible title challenge from the new world champions, who were unable to lift
  themselves after being dragged back down to earth during this feisty London
  derby, and it could have been worse given that Crystal Palace’s diminishing
  faith in authority was not exactly helped by Eberechi Eze having the only goal
  of the game ruled out by a pedantic VAR intervention. It would have been some
  way for Eze to sign off for Palace, assuming that his widely anticipated move
  to Tottenham goes through this week. The playmaker appeared to have given
  Oliver Glasner’s excellent side the lead when he blasted an early free-kick
  past Robert Sánchez, although Palace’s mistake was forgetting that nothing is
  ever truly certain in modern football. They have already had one prize
  snatched away this summer – Uefa demoting them to the Conference League over a
  failure to comply with multi-club ownership rules – and endured more
  frustration when Darren England, the on-pitch referee, was sent to the
  pitchside monitor and penalised Marc Guéhi for straying within a metre of the
  Chelsea wall as he grappled with Moisés Caicedo. A correct application of the
  law? Probably, but it still felt like too much interference. Glasner was right
  to point out that such offences rarely draw censure. “Everyone in the stadium
  thought it was a goal,” the Palace defender Chris Richards said. “But you live
  and die by VAR and today we died from it.” Yet Palace keep battling. They
  still risk losing Guéhi and Eze, whose participation in this game had been in
  doubt when talks over a move to Spurs progressed on Saturday, but nobody will
  relish playing them at the moment. There is some serious talent at Glasner’s
  disposal – Adam Wharton offered elegance in midfield, while Daniel Muñoz and
  Tyrick Mitchell negated Chelsea’s wingers – and after following up their
  victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup final last season by beating
  Liverpool in the Community Shield, this was further proof of their discipline,
  skill and tactical excellence. It gave context to Chelsea’s stumble. They
  might be playing catchup already but it is too early to talk of dropped
  points. Palace will probably threaten to inconvenience Chelsea’s rivals
  further down the line. Enzo Maresca was relaxed afterwards, saying he saw no
  signs of lethargy. Equally, though, concerns over whether Chelsea will pay a
  price in terms of physicality after earning all that prize money during their
  triumphant, extended summer have not disappeared .They had a crunched
  pre-season after going all the way in the Club World Cup and, for all the
  celebrations before kick‑off, it was fair to wonder if Chelsea would be ready
  to go only 35 days after taking Paris Saint-Germain apart in New Jersey. Those
  misgivings about Chelsea’s rustiness became evident during an opening in which
  their passes went astray and their attackers struggled to find space. There
  was an early booking for Reece James, Caicedo was guilty of some
  uncharacteristic loose touches and Maresca will not take much pleasure from
  seeing his argument for his superiors to react to Levi Colwill’s long-term
  knee injury by signing a new centre-back grow stronger. Colwill, so crucial to
  the team’s buildup play from the back, was missed. Tosin Adarabioyo’s absence
  with a minor issue was another complication, although Maresca was pleased with
  how Josh Acheampong performed as the central centre‑back in possession. There
  was one errant pass from the 19‑year‑old, sparking the sequence that led to
  Eze’s disallowed free‑kick, but he grew more assured as the game progressed.
  Chelsea improved in the second half. Estêvão Willian offered excitement after
  replacing Jamie Gittens, who had a disappointing debut on the left flank, and
  almost snatched the winning goal. Andrey Santos, who replaced a tiring Enzo
  Fernández during the closing stages, was wasteful with a decent opportunity.
  Yet Cole Palmer was quiet and João Pedro was crowded out by Palace’s imposing
  back three before making away for Liam Delap. Palace had plenty of moments;
  there was one gorgeous piece of play from Wharton, pirouetting and sending
  Jean-Philippe Mateta through to test Sanchez, while Eze had a chance to win it
  on the counterattack. In the end the mind went back to Eze being denied by
  officialdom. “I think there was no influence with Eb’s strike but the referee
  said Marc was too close so we have to accept it,” Glasner said. Palace’s
  manager looked to the future, insisting that Eze will start in his side’s
  Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad on Thursday. Chelsea will
  continue to evolve. They created little and remain likely to strengthen their
  attack with Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons. A share of the spoils with a
  decent side is no cause for anyone to panic.
