  Perhaps the biggest insult for the visitors was that the first half was still
  going on when Chelsea finally broke through. They were into the ninth minute
  of added time when João Pedro leapt to make it 1-0 and the Fulham head coach,
  Marco Silva, began to make peace with the realisation that the footballing
  Gods were not on his side on an afternoon that offered further proof of how
  the introduction of technology has made the sport too pedantic, stop-start and
  open to being warped by blurred lines over subjective calls. This game
  completely changed when Josh King, Fulham’s gifted 18-year-old midfielder, had
  a fine goal disallowed in the 21st minute. It is tiresome to have to talk
  about refereeing decisions but sometimes there is no other choice. The video
  assistant referee system has brought us to this point. We pore over minute
  details, hunting for infringements, desperately seeking reasons to chalk off
  goals. Yet there was no major appeal from Chelsea when King scored. Trevoh
  Chalobah was in a heap at the other end of the pitch after being caught by
  Rodrigo Muniz but most people saw a good breakaway goal from the visitors.
  Muniz had possession and was pirouetting away from Chalobah, who came in from
  behind to challenge the striker. The justification was a “careless challenge”
  but how do you challenge when you already have the ball? In any case the bar
  is surely supposed to be higher for VAR interventions. Clear and obvious? The
  only thing beyond doubt here was Silva’s rage. It stung that the lengthy check
  meant that there were eight added minutes at the end of the first half. Fulham
  cleared a corner in minute eight, only for play to go on. Silva argued that
  the whistle should have been blown for half-time before Enzo Fernández
  delivered the next one for João Pedro’s opener. Fulham, who remain winless in
  the league, are not enjoying the rub of the green. They were on the wrong side
  of some refereeing decisions against Manchester United last week. Chelsea, by
  contrast, have had lucky escapes in their first two home games. They would
  have lost to Crystal Palace had Marc Guéhi not been penalised for “wall
  interference” when Eberechi Eze scored a free-kick. As it is Chelsea have
  opened their campaign with seven points from three games. They look weary
  after their exertions at the Club World Cup but Enzo Maresca, who hinted that
  the possibility of a long lay-off for Liam Delap may force him into the market
  for another forward, was pleased with his side’s resilience. They survived
  Delap departing with an early hamstring injury and fought for the victory.
  João Pedro’s fifth goal for the club lifted the tension before another
  interminable VAR review at the start of the second half concluded with
  Fernández making it 2-0 from the penalty spot. It was a strange occasion. Away
  from the refereeing, there was also the odd sight of Fernández responding to
  his assist for João Pedro by shushing the home fans before ripping off the
  captain’s armband and appearing to throw it at Chelsea’s fitness coach, Marcos
  Álvarez. Andrey Santos, a direct competitor for Fernández, had been sent out
  to warm up before the goal. “Enzo is a Club World Cup winner, a World Cup
  winner,” Maresca said. “When he is not good enough, he can recognise it. In
  the first half he was not good enough.” Chelsea had started the day with a
  flurry of transfer activity, announcing Christopher Nkunku’s move to Milan and
  agreeing to send Nicolas Jackson on loan to Bayern Munich. Life moves quickly
  in these parts. By lunchtime there were jokes about Chelsea rushing Jackson
  back from Germany to fill in up front. They became a reality within two hours
  of the final whistle, with Chelsea seeking to cancel the loan move. Already
  deprived of the ingenuity of Cole Palmer, there was further concern for
  Maresca when Delap went off after 14 minutes. A compressed pre-season is
  having an impact. Levi Colwill is out and Moisés Caicedo is not at top speed.
  Chelsea are fighting off fatigue. They adjusted without Palmer, Jackson’s
  replacements starting together again, João Pedro and Delap combining through
  the middle. There was another opportunity for Estêvão Willian and the bright
  young things in attack made a confident start. Yet the mood changed when Delap
  hurtled down the left and pulled up with a hamstring injury. Tyrique George,
  who is expected to leave before the transfer window shuts, came on to play up
  front. Jamie Gittens, the £48.5m summer signing from Borussia Dortmund, waited
  his turn. Alejandro Garnacho’s arrival from Manchester United is a good thing;
  Chelsea suddenly look short of bodies in attack. Maresca was not happy with
  their level during the first half. The action was scrappy but King’s movement
  and footwork caught the eye at the tip of Fulham’s midfield. The youngster
  looks like he belongs. There was conviction when he received Sander Berge’s
  pass, sped away from Tosin Adarabioyo, cut past the former Fulham defender and
  beat Robert Sánchez with a low finish. Fulham’s joy was short-lived. Michael
  Salisbury, the man in Stockley Park, told the referee, Rob Jones, to check the
  pitchside monitor. Silva erupted. He smirked and shook his head. The
  travelling fans howled when they saw a replay of Muniz’s challenge. Chelsea
  were still off the pace, though. Caicedo denied Timothy Castagne after more
  good work from King. Gradually, Chelsea built some momentum. George went close
  as half-time approached. Fernández delivered a corner and João Pedro rose to
  head home. Fulham screamed daylight robbery. Their indignation grew when Ryan
  Sessegnon lifted his arms to block Chalobah’s cross in the 50th minute. It was
  a clear handball. Another long check was required to rule out a foul by João
  Pedro but the penalty was given and a much happier Fernández made it 2-0. It
  was not Fulham’s day.
