  Liverpool have confirmed the signing of the 18-year-old centre-back Giovanni
  Leoni from Parma for an initial £26m. He has a six-year contract and is
  regarded by the club as a potential long-term successor to Virgil van Dijk.
  Leoni was a target for other clubs, including Newcastle, and is expected to go
  straight into the first-team squad. The 6ft 4in defender has played for
  Italy’s under-18s and under-19s. The signing was announced shortly before
  Liverpool start their Premier League title defence at home to Bournemouth, a
  game Leoni will be at Anfield to watch. Leoni, who played in Serie A for the
  first time last season, making 17 appearances, told Liverpool’s website of his
  excitement at joining. “I’m so honoured,” he said. “I was very happy [about
  Liverpool being interested]. When I saw this I said: ‘Wow, this is crazy.’” He
  will wear the No 15 shirt and said: “I want to improve a lot with my new
  teammates in training and after on the pitch, in the Premier League and the
  Champions League.”
