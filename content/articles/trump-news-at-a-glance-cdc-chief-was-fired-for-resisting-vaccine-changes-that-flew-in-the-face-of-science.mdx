  CDC director Susan Monarez was fired after resisting changes to vaccine policy
  that were advanced by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and that she
  believed contradicted scientific evidence, according to a former acting
  director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Richard
  Besser said Monarez told him there were “two things she would never do in the
  job. One was anything that was deemed illegal, and the second was anything
  that she felt flew in the face of science – and she said she was asked to do
  both of those”. Fellow CDC employees cheered the three departing officials who
  quit after Monarez’s dismissal as they left the Atlanta campus on Thursday, in
  a show of defiance toward Kennedy and his unscientific claims about vaccines.
  Here is the key Trump administration news of the day. CDC officials who quit
  in protest lead call to ‘get politics out of public health’ Senior CDC vaccine
  research and public health leaders who resigned told hundreds of supporters
  across the street from campus on Thursday that the Trump administration needs
  to “get politics out of public health”. The agency is reeling from the firing
  of the CDC chief, Susan Monarez. Monarez, who was confirmed as its head just a
  month ago and has refused to be removed. Four senior leaders – Debra Houry,
  Demetre Daskalakis, Daniel Jernigan and Jennifer Layden – then resigned in
  protest, citing the alleged spread of misinformation under the Trump
  administration and political interference in their work. Read the full story
  White House reportedly picks Kennedy deputy to replace fired CDC chief The
  Trump administration has reportedly chosen a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr to
  serve as the acting head of the CDC. The Associated Press and the Washington
  Post reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the decision, that the
  White House had selected Jim O’Neill, currently the deputy secretary of the
  Department of Health and Human Services. The decision would give Kennedy a CDC
  chief who will be on board with his efforts to overhaul federal vaccine
  policy, the Post reported. Read the full story Trump serious about pursuing a
  third term, Gavin Newsom warns The president is gravely serious about running
  for a third term in violation of the US constitution, California governor
  Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday, warning Americans to “wake up” to what he
  described as Trump’s flagrant disregard for democratic norms. “I don’t think
  Donald Trump wants another election,” Newsom, a Democrat, said during a live
  interview at a summit hosted by Politico in Sacramento. “This guy doesn’t
  believe in free, fair elections.” Read the full story White House seeks to use
  Chicago-area military base for immigration crackdown The White House has
  requested that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with
  immigration operations as the Trump administration plans a broader takeover of
  Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”. On Thursday, the Naval Station Great Lakes
  confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had reached out for
  assistance, telling the Associated Press that the DHS had requested “limited
  support in the form of facilities, infrastructure and other logistical needs
  to support DHS operations”. Read the full story US air force to grant military
  honors to fatally injured January 6 rioter The air force will provide military
  funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, the rioter fatally shot during the January 6
  Capitol attack, marking another step in Donald Trump’s aggressive
  rehabilitation of the attack. Read the full story Fed governor Lisa Cook sues
  Trump over ‘illegal attempt’ to fire her The Federal Reserve governor Lisa
  Cook has filed a lawsuit against the US president over his “unprecedented and
  illegal attempt” to fire her, calling it an effort to undermine the central
  bank’s independence. The lawsuit – filed by Cook in federal court in
  Washington on Thursday – sets the stage for a legal battle over Trump’s
  extraordinary push for greater control of the central bank. Read the full
  story What else happened today: A Washington senator has called for the Trump
  administration to provide “immediate answers” about reports that two
  firefighters were detained by border agents as they were responding to a
  wildfire in the state. How Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over
  the US’s biggest MDMA company: Antonio Gracias is part of the growing movement
  among Silicon Valley’s right wing, enamoured with the therapeutic and
  commercial potential of drugs like MDMA. Seven people have arrived in Rwanda
  as part of a deal to accept deportees from the US, the Rwandan government has
  said. The Trump administration has been negotiating arrangements to send
  people to third countries including South Sudan and Eswatini, formerly
  Swaziland, as part of its wider deportation drive. The family of 18-year-old
  Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz was shocked when they found out that US Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (Ice) had discreetly moved him out of California,
  according to California congresswoman Luz Rivas, who spoke with his relatives
  and reviewed federal detention records. Catching up? Here’s what happened 27
  August 2025.
