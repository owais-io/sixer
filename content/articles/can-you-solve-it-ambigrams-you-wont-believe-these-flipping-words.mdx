  Douglas Hofstadter is probably best known as the author of Gödel, Escher Bach,
  a classic of popular science writing published in 1979. In 1983, he coined the
  word “ambigram”, meaning a piece of text that can be read in more than one
  way, an art form pioneered in the 1970s by the typographers Scott Kim and John
  Langdon. Typically, an ambigram is a word or phrase that has left-right mirror
  symmetry, or reads the same upside down. Hofstadter, aged 80, is professor of
  cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University, and has
  produced thousands of ambigrams over the decades. Here’s one that is
  pleasingly self-referential, taken from his latest book, Ambigrammia. It has a
  vertical line of symmetry through the “g”, which means you can read it left to
  right, and also in a mirror. The ‘ambi’ when reflected reads ‘rams’. Here’s
  another one, geographically appropriate, that has 180 degree rotational
  symmetry. (It reads the same upside down.) Isn’t it clever? The dots
  underneath the “r” and the “t” do not distract from the letters, but when
  upside down are clearly the dots on two “i”s. Hofstadter describes each
  ambigram as a “pocket-sized creativity puzzle.” So I thought they would make a
  perfect challenge for this column. Flipping words Design an ambigram for the
  following words: 1. DAVE 2. OHIO 3. UTAH 4. RED 5. Your own name The aim in an
  ambigram is legibility. You want the word to be as readable as possible.
  Usually an ambigram has perfect symmetry (mirror or rotational) as in the the
  two examples above, but not always, as in ‘GREEN’ in the top image. You can
  use upper case, lower case, or a mixture of the two. You will need to
  experiment at first. How much you can tweak a letter without making it
  unrecognisable, and how much you can add without overwhelming the eye? With
  DAVE, the A and the V are (almost) inversions of each other. Harder is to see
  how to make an E into an upside down D. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with
  Hofstadter’s designs for 1 to 5. If you would like me to feature your designs
  of your names in that post, please either email me or tag me on Twitter or
  Bluesky. UPDATE: To see a gallery of designs for the above challenge click
  here. Ambigrammia by Douglas Hofstadter, with an introduction by Scott Kim, is
  out now on Yale University Press I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate
  Mondays since 2015. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would
  like to suggest one, email me.
