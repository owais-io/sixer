  The Tennessee attorney general’s office has subpoenaed four medical groups in
  the state for records of abortions performed over the last several years as
  part of a lawsuit over the exceptions to the state’s near-total abortion ban,
  court documents obtained by the Guardian show. The four subpoenas were issued
  this spring to Vanderbilt University medical center and a Tennessee hospital
  run by the national Catholic chain Ascension, as well as two smaller medical
  practices in Tennessee, Heritage Medical Associates and the Women’s Group of
  Franklin. Although each subpoena is different, they broadly ask these
  organizations to turn over extensive information about instances in which they
  may have provided abortions, including the number of abortions performed since
  2022 and, in some of the subpoenas, all “documents and communications” related
  to those abortions. When and if the medical providers turn in the records,
  they are legally allowed to preserve “all patient confidentiality as
  necessary”, according to the subpoenas. A protective order has also been
  issued to block the records from being used to investigate the hospitals and
  medical providers outside of the scope of the lawsuit, as well as to
  potentially mark even the anonymized patient records as “confidential”. The
  sweeping requests raise questions about red-state attempts to track abortion
  providers in a post-Roe v Wade US. In the three years since the US supreme
  court overturned Roe, reproductive rights activists have grown increasingly
  concerned about government efforts to collect information on abortions,
  especially as states such as Louisiana and Texas have recently launched
  efforts to penalize abortion providers. Mary Ziegler, a professor at the
  University of California, Davis who studies the legal history of reproduction,
  shared her concerns that the Tennessee subpoenas could have “a tremendous
  chilling effect”. “Republican legislators have recognized that doctors are
  already not performing procedures that they – Republican legislators – say are
  justified under exceptions,” Ziegler said. “The message being sent here is
  that every single decision, even ones that would have been legal, then would
  be second-guessed.” The subpoenas were issued as part of a 2023 lawsuit
  brought by several Tennessee women and doctors who are seeking to broaden the
  exceptions in the state’s abortion ban. Although Tennessee – like every other
  state with an abortion ban – technically permits abortions in medical
  emergencies, these women say they were denied medically necessary abortions.
  Doctors across the country have said that the exceptions embedded in abortion
  bans are worded so vaguely that they are incompatible with medical standards,
  forcing doctors to delay or deny care until a patient becomes sick enough to
  legally qualify for treatment. At least five pregnant women have reportedly
  died under abortion bans in Georgia and Texas. In the years since Roe fell,
  more pregnant Texas women have also begun to be diagnosed with sepsis – a
  life-threatening condition – or almost bled to death after they miscarried,
  according to reporting by ProPublica. Lawyers for Tennessee, however, have
  said in court that the state’s abortion exceptions are workable as written.
  Some doctors’ failure to accurately interpret the law does not justify
  amending the state’s ban, Tennessee has argued, especially since the state
  legislature passed a bill in 2025 that sought to clarify the circumstances
  under which people can get abortions. The subpoenas issued to the medical
  providers ask them to turn over “all protocols, policies, guidelines, practice
  guides or handbooks” that they have used to determine whether patients can get
  abortions. The subpoena for Vanderbilt also demands records from the Nashville
  hospital’s abortion committee, which deliberates on whether and how to provide
  legal abortions to patients, including all “documents and communications” that
  may reveal the resolution of each case considered by the committee. The other
  subpoenas were issued to at least one medical practice that employs a
  Tennessee doctor who is a part of the lawsuit. They ask those practices to
  count the number of abortions they have performed since 2020, two years before
  Roe fell. They also ask for records from instances in which doctors did not
  provide abortions because they felt that the Tennessee ban blocked them from
  doing so. The subpoenaed groups and Tennessee attorney general’s office did
  not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Despite the court
  protections in place to keep the subpoenaed records from leaking, assurances
  from state officials may not be enough to quell doctors’ fears of prosecution,
  Ziegler said. She pointed to the case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant
  woman in Georgia who was kept on life support until she delivered a baby via
  caesarean section in June. While Georgia’s attorney general said that the
  state’s near-total abortion ban did not force doctors to keep pregnant women
  on life support, Smith’s doctors reportedly felt that the language of the ban
  was so strict that they still had no choice but to keep her alive. “Prior to
  any of these data requests, a lot of physicians and providers were really
  anxious about civil or criminal liability,” Ziegler said. “I don’t see how
  this is going to help matters.”
