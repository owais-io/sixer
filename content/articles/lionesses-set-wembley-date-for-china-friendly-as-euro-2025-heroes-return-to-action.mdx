  England will play China in a friendly at Wembley on 29 November, their first
  confirmed fixture following the Lionesses’ Euros triumph at the weekend. The
  match will be the third of four friendlies for Sarina Wiegman’s victorious
  team across the autumn, with the first two, in October, still to be announced,
  and pits the Asian champions against their European counterparts. It will also
  be the Lionesses’ third Wembley fixture of 2025, following victories over
  Spain in February and Portugal in May. England’s autumn friendlies will help
  them prepare for their 2027 World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins in
  February. Wiegman’s side were World Cup finalists in 2023 and will be hoping
  to go one better in Brazil in two years’ time. England’s most recent meeting
  with China came during their run to the 2023 final. They won 6-1 in Adelaide.
  “After an incredible month and the celebrations this week, we are already
  planning ahead,” Wiegman said. “It will be special to have a final visit to
  Wembley this year and something for us all to look forward to once the new
  season starts. “There are not many opportunities for us to play non-European
  opposition in the calendar so I am happy we have been able to secure a top
  Asian side like China for this Fifa window.” The fixture with China, who are
  ranked 17th in the world, will be a 5.30pm kick-off and broadcast live on ITV.
  Meanwhile, the financial reward for winning the Women’s FA Cup has been frozen
  for another year after the FA confirmed the competition’s prize pot for the
  season on Wednesday, meaning it remains more than three times smaller than the
  men’s prize. There has been a slender increase in the overall women’s pot,
  owing to the introduction of a preliminary round for clubs in the seventh
  tier. Winning teams will each receive £600, before the first round of
  qualifying. However, the money awarded to teams winning fixtures in all of the
  subsequent rounds of the competition remains unchanged. The £430,000 reward
  winning the final is unchanged for a third straight year. By contrast, the
  winners of the men’s FA Cup final take home £2m. Taking into account their
  cumulative reward for a successful cup run from the fourth round, when Women’s
  Super League sides enter, a WSL team would receive £814,000 for winning the
  cup, whereas a cup-winning men’s Premier League would accumulate £3,910,000.
  The prize for winning a women’s first-round tie is £6,000, compared with
  £45,000 for men’s first-round winners. The overall men’s fund is some £20m
  whereas the women’s sits at around £6m.
