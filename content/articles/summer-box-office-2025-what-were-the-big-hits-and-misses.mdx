  Another post-pandemic summer is over and we have ourselves another reminder
  that Barbenheimer was a fluke with overall takings down again. With some early
  hits, such as Lilo &amp; Stitch, some had expected this season’s blockbusters
  to take the industry to the magic $4bn mark (something only achieved once
  since 2019, thanks to Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy), but that was not to
  be. Box office was around $3.53bn, a gentle rise from last year, which
  suffered from a rocky start and ended up at $3.52bn. But what was behind that
  number and which films should have helped push it even higher? Millennial
  nostalgia is king Summer has been overtaken by nostalgia for some time now,
  but this year was overtaken by a certain kind of nostalgia from a certain
  period of time. It was a season geared towards those who view the 2000s as a
  formative cultural period and the bets mostly paid off. In mid-May, the sixth
  instalment of the Final Destination franchise (which started in 2000 and saw
  sequels throughout the decade) overperformed, becoming the highest-grossing in
  the series. In June, Danny Boyle returned to the world of 2002’s 28 Days Later
  with the start of a new trilogy, racking up $150m worldwide, almost double
  that of the original. The summer’s biggest hit soon followed, a live-action
  remake of 2002’s Lilo &amp; Stitch, the only film this season to crack $1bn.
  The original had been a hit on release but its popularity grew over time as
  teenagers turned into parents, creating a new generation of fans. Then in
  August, a follow-up to 2003’s Freaky Friday brought back Lindsay Lohan and
  Jamie Lee Curtis and flew past $115m worldwide (with more to come). One could
  even credit the $844m success of another rote Jurassic Park sequel to a
  generation’s undying love for the original … It’s not going away anytime soon
  (a prequel series to Legally Blonde and sequels to Shrek and Scary Movie are
  in the works), but this summer also showed the limitations of nostalgia. A
  follow-up to late-90s slasher franchise I Know What You Did Last Summer did
  just about OK worldwide given its small budget ($64m from $18m), but it wasn’t
  the easy win that Sony had expected (it made half of the 1997 original without
  inflation and the number paled in comparison to the new Scream movies), and a
  mid-credits kicker suggesting more to come will probably be the last we’ll
  see. Sony also struggled with a return to the Karate Kid franchise, which made
  less than a third of the 2010 reboot. Unlike the aforementioned hits, both
  films required more knowledge of the ins and outs of franchises that hadn’t
  lived on in quite the same way (both had most recently been resurrected on
  TV). Animated panic The biggest family hits of the summer were live-action
  remakes of Lilo &amp; Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon (over $1.6bn
  combined), a relief for Disney (after struggling with Snow White) and a new
  source of income for Universal/DreamWorks. But the success also came with a
  bitter aftertaste as while they both hit big, animation in general suffered.
  Pixar might have scored last summer’s biggest hit with Inside Out 2 ($1.69bn
  worldwide), but post-Covid it’s been otherwise wobbly with even Toy Story
  spin-off Lightyear ($226m worldwide) failing to catch fire. This summer saw
  the company’s worst-ever opening weekend for Elio, a cursed production that
  saw a change of director and reportedly a panicked de-queering. The film ended
  up making just $152m on an estimated budget of up to $200m. Back in 2011,
  Sony’s first Smurfs outing made an impressive $563m worldwide, the
  ninth-highest-grossing film of the year. While the 2013 sequel dipped below
  with $347m and the 2017 reboot even lower with $197m, these numbers were still
  far more impressive than what this summer’s latest attempt achieved, as the
  franchise moved from Sony to Paramount. The Rihanna-led Smurfs made just $31m
  in the US and $109m globally, a number one would perceive as franchise-ending.
  There was also a significant downturn for The Bad Guys franchise, with the
  second film currently running at $150m internationally compared with the first
  one’s $250m, a disappointment given an $80m budget. This past weekend, A24
  also tried to give Chinese smash Ne Zha 2 the Hollywood treatment with a
  dubbed version, populated by stars such as Michelle Yeoh. But the film, which
  had already broken box office records with a staggering $2.2bn gross, had
  already made $20m stateside earlier in the year. Audiences roundly rejected
  the redo and the film tanked in 13th position with just $1.5m. The weekend was
  overshadowed by another animated success story … KPop goes the box office
  During the unsureness of the pandemic, Sony decided to offload some of its
  films to Netflix, a bundle that unwisely included a film called KPop: Demon
  Hunters. At that time, in early 2021, it was only in development and no one
  knew what it would later become. Even when it was released on Netflix in June,
  there was still little buzz surrounding it, something that often happens with
  the original films the streamer decides not to go big on (last year’s
  extraordinary thriller Rebel Ridge also found itself somewhat dumped). But
  fans found it fast and the film rose and rose until it became a smash, big
  enough to not only push a Ryan Reynolds action movie off the all-time
  most-watched list but also achieve a rare Netflix theatrical release. Last
  weekend, a singalong version was dropped into select cinemas (certain chains
  refuse to show Netflix films so they were excluded) and it made an estimated
  $20m in the US, topping the box office. It’s a fascinating case study for the
  industry and a frustrating one for Sony, which has had a bumpy year so far.
  It’s obviously not certain what would have happened had the film been released
  by the studio theatrically given the market for original animation, and the
  film’s unprecedented success on Netflix is probably tied to how much easier
  something can catch fire on such an accessible platform that allows for
  endless rewatching. But its unusual journey has left some money on the table,
  whether that would have gone to Sony or Netflix. This summer also saw more
  streaming success for Apple as it achieved its biggest hit to date with F1:
  The Movie, which made $604m, also becoming Brad Pitt’s highest grosser. It was
  released in conjunction with Warner Bros and the tech giant has yet to unveil
  its release date on Apple TV+. The strategy – release a big movie wide and
  make people at home wait until they can watch it for nothing – edges Apple
  closer to an old-fashioned studio. A secret weapon For a long while, it seemed
  the only two reliable genres in Hollywood were superheroes and horror (even if
  a superhero horror failed to capitalise) and as the former started to see a
  downturn, the latter worryingly followed. Last year saw a string of stumbles
  including Abigail, The First Omen, Never Let Go, The Watchers, Afraid and The
  Front Room, and pre-summer this year, things hadn’t improved much with Opus,
  The Woman in the Yard, Wolf Man and Until Dawn all underperforming. But in
  April, just before the season kicked off, Sinners, Ryan Coogler’s
  one-of-a-kind hybrid of horror, fantasy, action and period drama, was a
  sustained smash, sticking inside the top 10 until mid-June (it’s become the
  highest-grossing original live-action film since Gravity). Weeks after, Final
  Destination: Bloodlines also became the franchise’s top earner by a
  considerable amount (it made $285m globally compared with the fourth chapter’s
  $186m) and alarm bells had stopped sounding. What audiences wanted, as shown
  by the success of last summer’s Longlegs, was something that felt special, and
  the genre’s oversaturation had left so many horror films feeling stale and
  unnecessary. While Sinners, technically released in spring, will be arguably
  the year’s most encouraging success story, the summer’s big horror win came in
  August with the release of Weapons, Zach Cregger’s ambitious follow-up to
  sleeper hit Barbarian. Like Sinners and Final Destination 6, it was also a
  Warner Bros release (summer bonuses to the marketing department) and like
  those two films it also had a larger-than-usual budget for the genre. But
  since its release, it’s flown past $200m globally and reminded studios of the
  power of a well-marketed original thriller-horror at summer. Back in the M
  Night Shyamalan heyday, these would come every two years and while quality
  faded, audiences mostly didn’t (even The Happening made over $160m worldwide).
  It’s worth noting that horror was still no surefire thing this summer
  (Together, Bring Her Back, Dangerous Animals and I Know What You Did Last
  Summer all underperformed) but Cregger’s twisty conversation-starter, built
  around a secret you had to find out for yourself, felt essential to both teens
  and their parents and was the kind of buzzy, mid-budget, R-rated success that
  we don’t see much of these days. I imagine we’ll be seeing more of them soon.
  Empty arthouses The post-pandemic box office hasn’t been kind to the smaller
  movie, especially in the summertime. Pre-2020, films such as Hereditary, Sorry
  to Bother You and RBG found a way to distract audiences from sequels and
  superheroes, but indie breakouts have been harder to spot in the summers
  since. This year was another disappointing season for counter-programming with
  A24 out of luck with both Eva Victor’s Sundance breakout Sorry, Baby in
  specialty release ($2.3m US) and Ari Aster’s Covid western Eddington in wide
  release ($10.1m US). Neon also struggled to profit from Toronto film festival
  award winner The Life of Chuck ($6.7m US). Sony Pictures Classics couldn’t
  capitalise on the Austen celebrations with Jane Austen Wrecked My Life ($1.8m
  US) or The Bear’s Molly Gordon’s rising star with Oh, Hi! ($2m US).
  Vertical-released Ron Howard thriller Eden, blessed with a starry cast,
  couldn’t open past $1m on the same weekend, as Ethan Coen’s comedy Honey
  Don’t! struggled to make it to $4m. Even a starry Wes Anderson movie like The
  Phoenician Scheme couldn’t make it past $20m in the US (Asteroid City almost
  reached $30m). What did work for A24 was Celine Song’s Materialists, one of
  their more successful commercial plays of late. The Dakota Johnson-led
  romantic comedy rose to $36m in the US and $85m worldwide, impressive given
  both the $18m budget and the genre’s recent performance at the box office
  (Anyone But You remains the rare success story). Like that film, it managed to
  spark online chatter, this time over its themes and character choices, but it
  remains to be seen if Johnson’s other romcom of the season can repeat its
  success (last weekend’s Splitsville is a slow rollout). Internationally the
  film was also handled by Sony, giving it a much-needed win … And superheroes
  are back … but also maybe not? After superhero matchup The Marvels saw out
  2023 with a super-embarrassing result (making $206m globally from a budget of
  $374m, a record low for the MCU), Marvel wisely took a pause. Last year saw
  the release of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine (a monster hit at $1.3bn) but those
  films exist slightly outside of the regular churn (it was the first Deadpool
  film to be released by Disney). Originally scheduled for last year, this
  February’s Captain America: Brave New World failed to break even ($415m from a
  $180m budget with experts claiming it needed to make over $425m) and then the
  summer kicked off, as it always used to, with a major Marvel release, this
  year being Thunderbolts. Somehow, despite a ton more hype, the film did even
  worse, making it to just $382m from a similar-sized budget (a far cry from the
  $1bn days of Marvel’s time in the sun). On the other side of the ring, DC was
  also in need of a hit. In 2023, the Aquaman sequel made less half of what the
  original achieved, while The Flash was reported to have lost the studio around
  $200m. 2024 was also a year for licking wounds with just the non-DCEU sequel
  Joker: Folie à Deux released (a film that also bombed, losing an estimated
  $140m). This summer saw the official DC relaunch with James Gunn’s Superman, a
  $225m big bet that many saw as a predictor of not just the future success of
  DC but superhero movies in general. It ended up a decent-sized, if not super,
  hit, bringing in $605m to date, a notable success more in the US than
  elsewhere. It’s the third-biggest film of the year in the US, with $347m, but
  falls down to sixth globally (it made 42% of its gross internationally
  compared with, say, Jurassic World: Rebirth, which was at 60%). It came in
  slightly underneath Man of Steel’s $670m but it was encouraging enough to show
  interest in where DC is heading. That’s more than can be said for Marvel,
  however, with The Fantastic Four: First Steps yet to make it to $500m after a
  strong start led to steep declines week-on-week. It might have won the critics
  back (an 87% rating compared with The Marvels at 63%) but audiences will need
  more to turn up en masse once again.
