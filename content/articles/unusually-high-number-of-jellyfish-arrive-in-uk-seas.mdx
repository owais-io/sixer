  An unusually high number of jellyfish have arrived in the UK’s seas this
  summer, experts have said. Jellyfish blooms arrive for their yearly
  reproduction cycle by following the current of warm water to the coast. Warm
  sea surface temperatures, which are exacerbated by global heating, create
  favourable conditions for jellyfish. This contributes to a population bloom
  and a prolonged stay during the summer season, and experts say the conditions
  are likely to lead to the arrival of new jellyfish species that prefer warmer
  waters. With record-high sea surface temperatures in April and May this year,
  according to the Met Office, a greater number of jellyfish blooms are expected
  to populate the UK coast. Jellyfish are a foundational element of the aquatic
  food web, as they are types of plankton that form the bases of many food
  chains. Compass jellyfish, identified by dark stripes on their bells and long
  tentacles which cause a painful sting, are a particular favourite source of
  food for turtles, said Abigail McQuatters-Gollop, a marine conservation
  specialist at the University of Plymouth. A common but spectacular species
  that has arrived in great numbers in UK waters this summer is the barrel
  jellyfish, which can grow to a metre in diameter. It has a thick bell with
  frilly arms. This species has a relatively mild sting and is eaten by humans
  in some areas of the world, such as parts of Asia. Other jellyfish species
  that have been identified this year include moon, lion’s mane, blue and mauve
  stinger species. The number of jellyfish sightings recorded by the Marine
  Conversation Society in 2024 was 1,432, a 32% increase compared with the
  previous year. McQuatters-Gollop said some evidence suggests that we are “more
  likely to have more jellyfish blooms because of climate change and the water
  getting warmer.” But the jellyfish will not stay for long as they have a short
  lifespan, with some being born and dying within the same summer.
  McQuatters-Gollop said that after the summer, some of the jellyfish may follow
  the current back out into sea, while others may “live out their days in the UK
  and die when they use up all their food supply, break apart from a storm, or
  from old age after they reproduce”. Jellyfish are composed of 90% water, are
  susceptible to strong currents and can break apart easily. McQuatters-Gollop
  said that extreme weather conditions that can break apart the fragile bodies
  of jellyfish are an effect of climate breakdown. She said jellyfish have
  “beautiful colours, long tentacles streaming behind them, and look like
  something that belong in outer space. “I wanted to encourage people to safely
  observe jellyfish and fall in love with them, because they are amazing and I
  feel so lucky when I dive and swim alongside them.” • The byline of this
