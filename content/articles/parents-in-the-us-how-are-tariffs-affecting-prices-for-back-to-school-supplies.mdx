  We want to hear from families in the US. As the new school year approaches,
  have you noticed rises in the cost of back-to-school items? How have prices
  changed recently? What has been the effect on your family? Since taking office
  in January, Donald Trump’s tariff policies have upended trading relationships,
  rattled global markets and stoked fears of inflation. The latest wave of the
  president’s tariffs came into force on 8 August – and more than 60 countries
  around the world are scrambling to respond. The US is still threatening major
  tariffs on China, and other major foreign suppliers of US goods are already
  working out how to pass on the costs of the levies. Business leaders have
  warned that Trump’s high, volatile tariffs will force companies to raise US
  consumer prices. Tariffs are already affecting prices at retailers including
  Walmart and Best Buy. How has the cost of getting ready for school affected
  you? If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service
