  When Guillermo del Toro accepted the Bafta for best director in 2018, he used
  his speech to pay homage to Mary Shelley, calling her “the most important
  figure from English legacy”. “She picked up the plight of Caliban and she gave
  weight to the burden of Prometheus,” Del Toro said. “She gave voice to the
  voiceless and presence to the invisible, and she showed me that sometimes to
  talk about monsters, we need to fabricate monsters of our own.” Nearly two
  decades after first announcing his intention to adapt Shelley’s Frankenstein,
  the Mexican film-maker is finally unveiling his vision of the classic at the
  Venice film festival. Featuring Oscar Isaac as the obsessive scientist and
  Jacob Elordi as the monster, the film rekindles Shelley’s meditation on the
  fragile boundary between humanity and monstrosity. But its premiere comes in a
  year when Venice appears particularly fixated on monsters of every stripe.
  Alberto Barbera, Venice’s artistic director, said the “fil rouge” of this
  year’s event was monsters, from Del Toro’s fantastical creature to the “real
  monsters” of the last century. “We have films about dictators of the past and
  present, from Mussolini and Ceaușescu to Gaddafi and Putin,” he told the
  Guardian. “There are films about the monstrosity of war in Ukraine and Gaza,
  the monstrosity of crimes committed by normal people, and the menace of the
  atomic bomb, which is a real fear.” The lineup includes Olivier Assayas’s
  political thriller The Wizard of the Kremlin, which traces Vladimir Putin’s
  rise to power and stars Jude Law as the future president and Paul Dano as his
  spin doctor. Jihan K’s documentary My Father and Qaddafi examines the
  disappearance in Cairo in 1993 of her father, Mansur Rashid Kikhia, the
  peaceful opposition leader to the Libyan dictator. Mihai Mincan’s Milk Teeth,
  set in the final days of Nicolae Ceaușescu’s dictatorship, follows a young
  girl who becomes the last witness to her sister’s mysterious disappearance in
  a small Romanian town, while Pietro Marcello’s Duse is a portrait of the
  artist Eleonora Duse set against the backdrop of rising fascism in Mussolini’s
  Italy. The preoccupation with monsters is not accidental, according to Natalie
  Lawrence, the author of Enchanted Creatures: Our Monsters and Their Meanings.
  “We’ve always been fascinated and repelled by the monsters like Frankenstein,
  because they always speak to something in us we’re struggling with deep down,”
  she said. “Not all monsters are bad, of course. But monsters have always been
  the corporeal forms for society’s concerns. Terrible humans become the monster
  of historical events, or fictional beasts are created from mythic anxieties.
  So you have a spectrum: from the real, genocidal dictators of recent times,
  made monstrous, all the way to the ancient moloch monster-deities of death.”
  That fascination extends to war and nuclear dread. Kathryn Bigelow’s A House
  of Dynamite, starring Idris Elba and Rebecca Ferguson, follows White House
  officials confronting the threat of a missile attack on the US. “Multiple
  nations possess enough nuclear weapons to end civilisation within minutes,”
  Bigelow said. “And yet there’s a kind of collective numbness – a quiet
  normalisation of the unthinkable”. Kaouther Ben Hania’s The Voice of Hind
  Rajab tells the story of a five-year-old Palestinian girl killed in January
  2024 when her family’s vehicle was shelled by Israeli forces. The film
  incorporates harrowing recordings of a final phone call between the girl and
  rescue services. And the Ukrainian producer Alexander Rodnyansky, sentenced in
  absentia to eight and a half years in prison by a Russian court for his
  anti-war stance, will premiere his documentary Notes of a True Criminal,
  reflecting on Ukraine’s turbulent history and its personal toll. “We are
  living in really dangerous times,” Barbera said. “I’m part of the post-world
  war II generation that believed peace was permanent. But the world we knew is
  collapsing. We are dealing with wars in every corner, and the threat of
  nuclear weapons. Film-makers are responding with a return to a cinema of
  reality. They don’t always provide answers, but they always ask questions.”
  Barbera said he expected this year’s festival may also be marked by political
  demonstration. “But the films themselves already speak to the problems of the
  contemporary world. Venice is not a closed space; it is a space for
  confrontation.” A pro-Palestinian protest is expected to take place at the
  festival on 30 August, while the group Venice4Palestine called on the Biennale
  to withdraw invites to Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot, who star in Julian
  Schnabel’s In The Hand of Dante alongside Oscar Isaac, Al Pacino and Martin
  Scorsese, and who have supported Israel in the past. A total of 21 films will
  compete for this year’s Golden Lion, with a jury led by Alexander Payne, the
  director of The Holdovers. Among the most anticipated in competition are
  Yorgos Lanthimos’s Bugonia, starring Emma Stone; Noah Baumbach’s ensemble
  comedy Jay Kelly, featuring George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Laura Dern and Greta
  Gerwig; and Benny Safdie’s The Smashing Machine, with Dwayne Johnson and Emily
  Blunt. Jim Jarmusch’s anthology Father Mother Sister Brother, with Adam
  Driver, Cate Blanchett, Charlotte Rampling, Vicky Krieps and Tom Waits, and
  Park Chan-wook’s No Other Choice, starring Lee Byung-hun, are also in
  competition. Beyond the competition, the festival will feature Luca
  Guadagnino’s After the Hunt, with Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Chloë
  Sevigny, and Werner Herzog’s new documentary Ghost Elephants. Herzog will
  receive a Golden Lion for lifetime achievement, alongside Kim Novak, a
  Hollywood star of the 1950s who appeared in Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo.
