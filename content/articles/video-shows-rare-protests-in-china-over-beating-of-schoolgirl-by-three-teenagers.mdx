  A large protest erupted in the south-western Chinese city of Jiangyou, videos
  on social media have shown, after the beating of a young girl by three other
  teenagers caused public outrage. Protests of this scale are rare in China,
  where opposition to the ruling Communist party and anything seen as a threat
  to civil order is swiftly quashed. But bullying in the country’s
  ultra-competitive education system has touched a public nerve, with a
  high-profile killing last year prompting national debate over how the law
  deals with juvenile offenders. On Monday, police said two teenage girls were
  being sent to a correctional school for assaulting and verbally abusing a
  14-year-old girl surnamed Lai. The beating, which took place last month and
  caused multiple bruises to Lai’s scalp and knees, was filmed by bystanders who
  shared it online, police said. The onlookers and a third girl who participated
  in the abuse were “criticised and educated”, police said, adding that their
  guardians had been “ordered to exercise strict discipline”. The case drew
  outrage online from some lamenting that the teenagers’ punishment did not go
  further. Later on Monday, people gathered outside the city hall in Jiangyou,
  in Sichuan province, with large crowds stretching around the block, footage
  showed. Video confirmed as having been shot outside the city hall showed at
  least two people being forcibly pulled aside by a group of blue-shirted and
  plainclothes police, and a woman in a black dress being dragged away by her
  limbs. “They’re sweeping away citizens everywhere,” a person can be heard
  saying as the woman is dragged away. More footage taken after dark showed
  police wearing black Swat uniforms subduing at least three people at an
  intersection where there were hundreds of bystanders. In a video posted online
  by the YouTube account Yesterday BigCat, which shares content about protests
  in China, one protester angrily quotes one of the alleged attackers, who is
  reported to have boasted about being apprehended but then released by police
  several times in the past. On Tuesday, Jiangyou was the second top-trending
  topic on the Weibo social media platform, before it and related hashtags were
  censored. “The sentence is too light … that is why they were so arrogant,” one
  top-liked Weibo comment under the police statement read. Local authorities
  said on WeChat that police had punished two people for fabricating information
  about the school bullying case, and they warned the public against spreading
  rumours. In recent years, protests led by parents or triggered out of concerns
  for child safety have become increasingly common. In 2023, thousands of people
  protested in Shangqiu, a city in Henan province, after the death of a
  14-year-old student. The boy’s school said he had died by suicide, but his
  parents said his body showed signs of physical abuse and said he had been
  attacked. Last year Chinese authorities vowed to crack down on school bullying
  after a high-profile murder case. In December, a court sentenced a teenage boy
  to life in prison for murdering his classmate. The suspects, all aged under 14
  at the time of the murder, were accused of bullying a 13-year-old classmate
  over a long period before killing him in an abandoned greenhouse. Another boy
  was given 12 years in prison, while a third, who the court found did not harm
  the victim, was sentenced to correctional education. With Agence France-Presse
