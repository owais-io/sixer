  The US Department of Justice is seeking sanctions against a lawyer who sought
  to block the deportation of his client, in another sign the Trump
  administration is ramping up its efforts to enact mass deportations. Earlier
  this year, Joshua Schroeder, a California-based attorney, was able to briefly
  delay the deportation of his client, a Hmong man from Laos, through several
  court filings. The Trump administration filed a sanctions motion against
  Schroeder, Politico reported last week, and argued that the attorney made
  “myriad meritless contentions” in his filings and a “pattern of knowing or
  reckless misrepresentations”. The justice department is seeking “substantial”
  monetary sanctions. Schroeder’s attempts to block his client’s removal were
  ultimately unsuccessful. The motion by the justice department comes as Donald
  Trump has pledged to crack down on immigration attorneys and firms engaging in
  “unscrupulous behavior … that undermine immigration enforcement”. The
  president signed a memorandum in March instructing the US attorney general to
  prioritize sanctions against attorneys and firms that pursue “frivolous,
  unreasonable, or vexatious” lawsuits against the government. But advocates and
  civil rights organizers have warned the policies are meant to hamper the work
  of immigration lawyers, and fear Trump is weaponizing the justice department
  against those opposed to his agenda. Schroeder appears to be the first
  attorney individually targeted by the administration following the March memo.
  He told Politico the sanctions motion reminded him of Trump’s orders targeting
  large law firms associated with people the US president considers enemies, and
  appeared to be part of a broader strategy. “They’re able to go all the way
  down to the very bottom, that’s where I am – no offense to myself … It’s top
  to bottom. It’s not just this elite struggle,” he told the outlet. Schroeder
  is a solo practitioner whose firm focuses on constitutional law, intellectual
  property and immigration law, and a legal scholar who has previously written
  about how attorneys can use habeas corpus to get immigrants out of detention.
  Schroeder’s client is a Hmong immigrant who came to the US as a child and
  later served time in prison for attempted murder. He lived in Oklahoma with
  his wife when he was taken into custody by US immigration customs and
  enforcement during an April check-in. The attorney was representing his client
  pro bono, and in May filed an emergency motion in a Texas court to prevent his
  removal from the US. Schroeder argued that deporting him to Laos would put him
  in “direct threat to life and limb” because of the role of the Hmong aiding
  the US during the Vietnam war. In his filings, Schroeder highlighted the
  administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act in its deportation efforts, and
  argued the government could use that to “apply to any immigrant or disfavored
  U.S. citizen”. While Schroeder was able to temporarily block his client’s
  removal, he was moved to a facility in Guam and eventually deported in June
  after another judge dismissed the case, ruling that the government was
  deporting him not under the AEA but the Immigration Nationality Act. The Trump
  administration argued that Schroeder should be sanctioned for his conduct, and
  that he knowingly made baseless accusations against the government and acted
  in bad faith, “maintaining positions without bases in fact and law”. “Having
  been warned multiple times that his client had a valid removal order,
  Schroeder nevertheless persisted in delaying the lawful execution of that
  order,” the government’s filing said, adding that he “refused to give straight
  answers” regarding the grounds for his claims. “That is not the conduct of a
  forthright but mistaken advocate. His evasiveness evidences knowledge of his
  guilt and an unwillingness to accept responsibility for his actions.”
  Schroeder told Politico he was working “under very heightened pressure” to
  prevent his client from being moved outside the US. He does not expect the
  motion to be successful, but speculated the filing was intended to punish him
  and could discourage other lawyers from taking on certain cases. “I think this
  motion for sanctions is not going to work, but it might do what they want it
  to do anyway,” he said. The Department of Justice declined to offer comment
  outside the filing.
