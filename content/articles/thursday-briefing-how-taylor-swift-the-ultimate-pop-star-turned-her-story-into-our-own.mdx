  Good morning. Readers, I have a confession: like millions of romantics across
  the world, I am a Swiftie. The multiplatinum pop singer-songwriter speaks to
  me. It started when I was 16. Taylor Swift’s second studio album, Fearless,
  dropped in the UK in March 2009. That summer, much to my younger brother’s
  despair, I blasted Fifteen, Love Story, You Belong With Me and The Way I Loved
  You (the best song on the album – argue with the wall!) on repeat. I entered
  my 20s singing, badly, to 22 (and promptly stopped when a neighbour rightfully
  told me to shut up at 2am). I followed the ups and downs of her romantic
  entanglements, her REALLY cringey girl-gang era, watched in horror as she
  became a punchline and the target of mass contempt, and then smiled at her
  triumphant return during the pandemic with Folklore and Evermore. While I
  haven’t loved every album, and she’s been so prolific some have passed me by,
  I love that her music can transport me instantly back to being 15, 22, and
  now, gasp, 33. So yes, I was pleased to learn that American football superstar
  Travis Kelce and Swift, self-styled “your English teacher and your gym
  teacher”, announced their engagement this week. The news broke the internet,
  prompting push notifications from major news organisations (including the
  Guardian), sparking the BBC to even launch a specific liveblog, and lit up
  group chats, including mine. Is that embarrassing and corny? Probably. But I
  like that despite her very public breakups, she kept singing about love, and
  kept believing in it (alright, I’ll stop now). How has she managed to remain
  this successful, this adored, for nearly two decades? Why does Swift have such
  a hold on several different generations? To dig into this very important
  question, I spoke to Dr Lucy Bennett, an academic at Cardiff University’s
  school of journalism, media and culture. That’s after the headlines. Five big
  stories UK news | The fertility rate for England and Wales has fallen for the
  third year in a row to reach a record low, figures show. Last year’s total
  fertility rate of 1.41 was the lowest since comparable data was first
  collected in 1938. Gaza | Children under 15 years old made up almost a third
  of outpatients treated for wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans
  Frontières (MSF) in Gaza last year, statistics published in the Lancet reveal.
  US news | Two children were killed and 17 injured in a mass shooting at a
  Catholic school in Minneapolis on Wednesday. ChatGPT | Open AI is changing the
  way it responds to users who show emotional distress after legal action from
  the family of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who killed himself after months of
  conversations with the chatbot. Ukraine| Russian strikes killed at least four
  people in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and wounded at least 24 others, city
  officials said on Thursday morning. Casualty numbers were expected to rise. In
  depth: Songs that resonate Taylor Swift is quite possibly the most successful
  pop artist of her generation. She has reached this position, and a net worth
  of $1.6bn, thanks in large part to her devoted fans, who range from “oldies”
  like me to Gen Alpha tweens. But how has she been able to connect to girls and
  women of all ages? Dr Lucy Bennett told me it’s down to her impressive
  lyricism. “I think that Swift resonates so strongly with women across
  generations because her songwriting often captures universal experiences, such
  as love, heartbreak, friendship, and self discovery, in a way that feels both
  deeply personal and widely relatable.” Bennett added that many women, like
  myself, feel as though we have grown up alongside her. Our own personal
  milestones – first love, first heartbreak, moving out, being thrust from our
  childhood bedrooms into the adult world and the identity crisis we all seem to
  go through before turning 30 – seem to echo through her songs. “At the same
  time, her openness about vulnerability and resilience, and her willingness to
  challenge cultural double standards against women, makes her a powerful figure
  of identification not just for younger fans but also for older generations who
  recognise their own stories in her work,” Bennett said. *** Swift and her fans
  Swift’s relationship with her fans can be intense, with some corners of the
  so-called “Swiftie fandom” veering into toxicity. Bennett described it as one
  of deep connection, pointing to Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour, which
  “worked so well to enhance these connections, being particularly meaningful in
  the way it shifts through time, through Swift’s different personal situations,
  also allowing fans then to reflect on their own stories and experiences.” The
  announcement of her engagement sparked a flood of videos of fans weeping on
  camera. Many said it felt as though a close friend had just announced they
  were getting married. “I think Swift inspires such intense feelings in her
  fans due to the connection that people have with her and her music. Many have
  grown up with her, linking the music to their specific memories and different
  things they have gone through in life, and so feel an emotional bond with
  her,” Bennett said. For many fans, this is a parasocial relationship – where
  one person feels a sense of intimacy with someone they’ve never actually met.
  Which is, advantageously, a good way to build an empire. *** A savvy
  businesswoman Swift is a savvy businesswoman who has been successful largely
  in her ability to leverage personal life stories into these juggernauts of
  financially lucrative events. “The engagement has been announced in the lead
  up to the new album, so the focus and media frenzy around this may work to
  promote the album even further... In this way, her private life becomes not
  only a source of artistic inspiration but also a powerful driver of wider
  cultural conversation and commercial success,” Bennett said. This is perhaps
  what makes Swift stand out from her contemporaries. When she released her
  first album in the mid 2000s, she utilised Myspace heavily to tease out clues
  of her next move, jumping on Tumblr, X, and now YouTube, Instagram, and
  TikTok. “One of the things that makes Swift stand out compared to other pop
  stars is her intricate use of Easter eggs and coded messages for fans to
  decipher. While other artists have adopted similar practices, Swift has
  strongly elevated it, embedding hidden meanings, symbols, and narrative
  threads across her albums, videos and social media,” Bennet said. “This
  invites a kind of forensic engagement from fans, who search for clues in even
  the smallest details. The result is not just passive listening but an active,
  almost collaborative relationship, where fans feel drawn deeper into her world
  through the thrill of solving something.” *** Singing into the sunset Swift
  has released so much music over the past two decades – 11 original studio
  albums and counting – that fans who have connected with heartbreak and triumph
  always seem to have something new to return to. But will her engagement, and
  what many hope will be a blissful marital happily ever after, change her
  relationship with fans? Bennett doesn’t think so. “For some fans they may now
  feel even more invested in her future. The announcement provoked such an
  emotional response from some, and this is because we have lived the
  rollercoaster of her love life alongside her. For some, they feel a core part
  of her journey due to her music being so deeply personal. We have her songs
  about the heartbreaks, the disappointments in love, with many fans then using
  the music to reflect on their own situations,” Bennet told me. While some are
  worried her songs won’t have the same emotional intensity if she’s not singing
  about heartbreak, Bennet added that for many, this announcement is “the
  culmination of a journey they’ve been part of.” Either way, as Swift once
  sang, “long live all the magic we made”. What else we’ve been reading A
  beautiful piece from Amy Fleming about repurposing her dad’s old clothes,
  which also struck me as also a lament on time passing, and how hard it can be
  to let some things go. Phoebe As a people pleaser, I really enjoyed reading
  this account by Adele Parks on how the strong reactions to her decision to
  become a vegetarian taught her how to establish boundaries. Aamna I love
  seeing old petrol stations and this picture essay celebrates the best and most
  characterful of UK garages, including one mock-Tudor one from the 1920s and
  one in Devon that is now a tearoom. Phoebe There’s been lots of think pieces
  on the dangers of ChatGPT, but Imogen West-Knights says it best when she
  writes of her fear that the upcoming AI revolution will stop our ability to
  use our brains and, well, think. Aamna Marina Hyde was funny on a day in the
  life of Robert Jenrick, which involves driving around in a Range Rover while
  mulling over flag photo opportunities and what gags he could text to JD Vance.
  Phoebe Sport Football | League Two Grimsby stunned Manchester United with a
  12-11 penalty shootout win after a 2-2 draw in the second round of the Carabao
  Cup. US Open | Emma Raducanu rapidly dispatched Janice Tjen 6-2, 6-1 while
  Jack Draper has pulled out before the second round with arm injury. Cameron
  Norrie won a bruising battle with Francisco Comesaña 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-7 (0) 7-6
  (4) and set up a third‑round match with Novak Djokovic. Cricket | The Hundred
  will adopt a new system of player recruitment next season, with the draft to
  be dropped in favour of an open auction that gives franchises the chance to
