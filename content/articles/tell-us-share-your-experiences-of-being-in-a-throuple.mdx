  The Guardian’s Saturday magazine is looking for throuples to talk honestly
  about the experience of love and commitment. We’re particularly interested in
  talking to throuples living together under one roof, as well as throuples who
  are raising children as a unit of three parents. Is it easier to manage
  childcare duties when there are more adults in the room? Or more difficult? It
  is important that all parties agree to being featured. This means we need you
  to ask the other people involved whether they’re also willing to take part. We
  are hoping to feature existing throuples who are happily cohabiting, and also
  throuples who have broken up, and are willing to be candid about why they
  didn’t make it. The idea is to spotlight alternative ways of living and
  loving, and explore how we can reimagine the family unit.
