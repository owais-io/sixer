  Britain’s clean energy future risks creating “winners and losers” if
  lower-income households are not shielded from the costs added to energy bills
  to pay for it, the head of the energy regulator has said. Jonathan Brearley,
  Ofgem’s chief executive, said a “systematic approach” to sharing the rising
  costs of the government’s green power ambitions was needed to avoid poorer
  households facing soaring monthly payments. The regulator for Great Britain
  launched a root-and-branch review on Wednesday into how the costs of upgrading
  the energy networks can be recovered through home energy bills in a way that
  is fairer. The review could include plans to cut standing charges for
  lower-income households while wealthier customers pay a higher cost for
  upgrading the energy system. Brearley told the Guardian: “All of these changes
  that one might make to create a better energy system will have winners and
  losers. It may well be that the best thing to do is to have a more systematic
  answer to the question of affordability.” This would allow the country to make
  sweeping changes to the energy system “without always living in fear that
  you’re going to make some people on low income even worse off”, he added.
  Energy affordability has become a rising concern in Whitehall in recent years
  as gas and electricity bills have become a larger part of each household’s
  total costs, while the levies used to support grid upgrades and low-carbon
  energy projects have become a larger part of energy bills. This trend is
  likely to accelerate, according to industry experts. As Great Britain begins
  to rely more on cheaper homegrown renewable energy the cost of electricity may
  fall but the fixed costs levied on to bills will continue to rise to cover the
  costs of a changing energy system. Currently the cost of maintaining the pipes
  and wires that deliver the gas and electricity to homes and businesses is
  recouped through standing charges on home energy bills. These fixed daily
  charges, which also include the cost of fitting smart meters and other policy
  costs, are applied to energy bills regardless of how much energy a bill payer
  uses. This means cash-strapped households who are unable to heat their homes
  still bear the full brunt of covering energy network costs while vulnerable
  consumers – who are often high users of energy for medical or health needs –
  will also end up paying above the odds to maintain the grid. The standing
  charge has ballooned in recent years from an average of £182.27 a year five
  years ago to an average of £334.07 a year – or almost a fifth of the average
  annual energy bill. These costs have been described by the consumer champion
  Martin Lewis as “a moral hazard”, and could climb further as the UK prepares
  to invest heavily in upgrading its electricity grids to meet the government’s
  goal of creating a clean energy system by 2030. “We want to get under the skin
  of how those costs are allocated across the system,” Brearley said. “Is it
  still right that we have variable charges by region? If we are wanting to
  encourage people to use energy when [renewable energy] is more abundant, then
  is there a way to allocate these costs to do this? And should this be on the
  volumetric charge or the standing charge?”
