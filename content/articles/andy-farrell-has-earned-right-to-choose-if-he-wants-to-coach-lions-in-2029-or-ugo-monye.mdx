  Whether Andy Farrell is the British &amp; Irish Lions head coach on the 2029
  tour of New Zealand should ultimately come down to if he wants to do it. He
  has earned the right to choose. Those responsible for making the decision
  should not be looking at any other candidate. Why would you go hunting
  elsewhere and try to find someone else when you already have the best coach
  available right in front of you? Put simply, Farrell has delivered. He was
  told in no uncertain terms to deliver a first series win in 12 years and that
  is precisely what he has done. The Lions are closing in on a 3-0 series
  whitewash, something Farrell targeted from the start of the tour and that
  would bring about another significant slice of history. I’ve had the privilege
  of working with him and I know that the players love him. Putting together an
  international team is hard enough but choosing from four international teams
  and pulling them together is all the more difficult. Farrell has provided them
  with clarity from the outset. They’re not England, Ireland, Scotland or Wales
  players – they are Lions. Fostering that culture has been one of his greatest
  strengths. He makes players feel empowered, he treats them like adults and
  before we even talk about his tactical acumen, it is his emotional ability as
  a coach that makes him so outstanding. He is a force of nature and he has also
  handled Owen Farrell’s selection well. No one knows a player better than his
  dad and from the day the squad was picked, I had a strong feeling we would
  still be seeing Owen appear on this tour. His performance against the First
  Nations &amp; Pasifika XV – staying the course for 80 minutes despite such
  little game time previously – and his cameo in the second Test have justified
  his call-up. What really impresses me about Andy Farrell is that he keeps the
  job of head coach really quite simple. His remit is to win Test matches and so
  it’s not a surprise in the slightest to see that he has only made two changes
  for the clash in Sydney. You factor in certain issues – injuries, rest,
  recovery and where players are physically and mentally – but once you sift
  through that, selection becomes easier. He has parked sentiment – as seen by
  his decision to omit Sione Tuipulotu from the second Test in his home city –
  because nothing trumps picking the side that gives you the best hope of
  winning. If the Lions do go on and complete the 3-0 series win there will be
  questions about where they rank and how they measure up against some of the
  best sides of yesteryear. It’s difficult to assess and it’s subjective. In the
  short term I prefer to celebrate the achievement and worry about putting it
  into context further down the line. The danger with trying to do that now is
  that it could end up minimising it and I don’t think that’s fair on the Lions.
  I don’t think we are particularly good at celebrating things sometimes; we can
  look for reasons to shoot achievements down. And if the Lions play anywhere
  near their potential, I expect them to win again. The attitude has to be that
  the job is done but it is not complete. Maro Itoje, the captain, is a serial
  winner in a squad with plenty of them. It’s all over after Saturday, 80
  minutes and then this group will never be together again. They have
  demonstrated their character with their comeback victory last weekend but just
  imagine if they play to their potential in Sydney. It’s all within their gift
  and it’s an amazing privilege so they won’t be short of motivation. While I
  expect the Lions to wrap up the series in style, it is no foregone conclusion.
  I’ve been in the same position as the Wallabies. In 2009 we let ourselves down
  in the first Test, were much better in the second but came up short and then
  managed to salvage something in the third. The series may have slipped away
  but you’re playing for pride. We felt like we had put so much into that tour
  of South Africa and hadn’t achieved the result we felt we deserved. But we had
  another opportunity to get something out of the series and make people feel
  proud. We wanted to acknowledge the effort people had made in coming to
  support and the Wallabies will be desperate to give something back to the
  Australian rugby public. They have a sense of injustice about how last
  weekend’s match panned out, they are always fighting for oxygen against all
  the other sports that dominate in Australia and they have had to deal with
  questions over whether the Lions should even come back in 12 years’ time. All
  of that gives the Wallabies plenty to fight for.
