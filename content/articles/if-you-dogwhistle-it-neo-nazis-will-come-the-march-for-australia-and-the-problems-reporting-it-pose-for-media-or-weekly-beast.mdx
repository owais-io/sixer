  It can be a wicked problem, working out how to report on, for example,
  potentially racist marches. Do you refuse to give them airtime? Mention them
  but be sure not to glorify them? How much detail do you include? There are
  plans under way for a “March for Australia” that is taking place (according to
  one of the anonymous organisers – multiple people claim to be in charge) on 31
  August. Sydney’s Daily Telegraph strongly featured the flyer for the event,
  with the date and time and the March’s slogans at the top of the story.
  News.com.au worried that the protest had sparked a “divisive debate” (as
  opposed to itself being divisive). Both also pointed out racist links. The
  original flyer talked about taking Australia “back”, although it didn’t
  clarify to where. And it demanded “no foreign flags”, although the background
  showed the union jack. Comments on the social media pages of people reposting
  details about the march quickly filled up with racist garbage and conspiracy
  theories. The neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell described it as “our” public rally in a
  post to Telegram, calling for “White Australians” to assemble “against the
  traitors and foreigners” – even as some of the organisers denied any Nazi
  connections. No Robinson Crusoe Australia’s pledge to recognise a Palestinian
  state was labelled many things. Pointless symbolism. Important symbolism. A
  move that did not go far enough. A move that would enrage Donald Trump and
  Israel and please Hamas. And myriad tensions boiled over on Thursday with
  (some slightly confusing) reports that Hamas had welcomed the move, despite
  the Australian government’s pledge that there would be no role for Hamas in a
  future Palestine state. Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary
  as a free newsletter Among the febrile news yarns and think pieces about the
  significance of Australia’s move, particularly in the News Corp papers, there
  was little and sometimes no mention of the group Australia has joined. It came
  down to news.com.au to put it in perspective – Australia will join about 150
  other nations in pledging to recognise a Palestinian state. Most dangerous
  place on Earth to be a journalist Israel has now killed more than 190 media
  workers and journalists in Palestine, the Committee to Protect Journalists
  says, with an Al Jazeera team the latest victims. Al Jazeera puts the number
  at closer to 270. Anas al-Sharif and four of his colleagues were killed by an
  Israeli airstrike as they sat in a journalists’ tent near a hospital in Gaza
  City. On Thursday the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance released a video
  of more than 100 of its members reading the names of those killed. The MEAA
  media federal president, Michael Slezak, said journalists were “reporting on
  the horrors being inflicted on the civilians of Gaza … making it the most
  dangerous place on Earth to be a journalist”. The Israel Defense Forces
  bragged of the kill, announcing it on social media with bullseye emoji. They
  claimed al-Sharif was Hamas, with scant evidence. The Committee to Protect
  Journalists and al-Sharif himself had anticipated there would be retaliation
  for his reporting on starvation in Gaza. “If these words reach you, know that
  Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice,” he said. Killing
  journalists is a war crime and this attack was another strike on the flow of
  information from Gaza. ‘Pipeline’ threat Meanwhile, Sky News reckons it has
  found the real threat to press freedom. On Thursday The Australian published a
  piece about Victoria’s Respectful Relationships curriculum, which includes
  information about transgender issues. The piece referred to a
  terrifying-sounding “pipeline” from schools to transgender clinics. The
  Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, immediately hit back. “Transgender kids are
  15 times more likely to kill themselves … supporting those kids and supporting
  those families should be a priority because it’s the right thing to do,” she
  said. “What’s not right is this ongoing campaign to tear down programs that
  are about strengthening kids’ resilience, it’s about preventing bullying,
  about protecting kids against future harm, that’s what needs to stop.” She
  made it clear that she was referring to The Australian’s “ongoing campaign”
  and said the pipeline notion was “disgraceful” and “nonsense”. The Australian
  responded with a fairly straight news story about her comments. Sky News,
  though, was having none of it. Her “disturbing attack on free and open
  reporting” was in a “heated defence of a radical push of transgender ideology
  to five-year-olds”, it said. It was a “rant”, a “full-throttled attack”. Sky
  quoted Bella d’Abrera, the director of the foundations of western civilisation
  program at the Institute of Public Affairs, decrying “the indoctrination of
  children with fringe theories about sex and gender”. Fame then defamation case
  The chilling effect of Australia’s defamation laws may have thawed somewhat
  with a landmark ruling on the high-profile orthopaedic surgeon Munjed Al
  Muderis’s case. A joint investigation by Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes aimed
  to counterbalance years of extensive positive media about the surgeon
  (including in Guardian Australia) with claims from his patients about
  negligent post-operative care and more. Al Muderis launched a defamation case.
  The federal court dismissed it last Friday (he will reportedly appeal) in what
  has been called a significant test of a new public interest defence added to
  defamation laws in 2021. The long-running trial’s dismissal would have been a
  huge relief for many – not least for the investigative journalist Charlotte
  Grieve. Just three days after the decision the press release for her book on
  the case dropped. ‘Swimming against a tide’ The writer and host of Radio
  Atlantic Hanna Roisin, in Sydney for Friday’s Women in Media conference, says
  she wants to give people a visceral sense of how things have changed for women
  and for the media more broadly in the Trump 2.0 era. “The rules don’t apply
  any more,” she says. “We are flooded with preposterous lies all the time. “We
  are swimming against a tide that is bigger than we are.” That means going back
  to basics. “Our job is to record the truth using the tools we have as
  journalists,” she says. She sees some hope. For a while, she says, people felt
  they simply couldn’t deal with covering a second Trump term. “It’s very
  disorienting,” she says. “But I think people are finding their energy,
  especially women journalists. They’re finding their sources, they’re having
  fun with it.” On your marks Two weeks after he unveiled his vision for staff,
  the ABC’s managing director invited a handful of media reporters to the Ultimo
  boardroom for a briefing on how he plans to lead the ABC for the next five
  years. One of them was Guardian Australia’s media correspondent, Amanda Meade.
  She reports that if there was a message Hugh Marks wanted to send it was that
  the ABC is a no-nonsense organisation focused on quality programming. Under
  this MD the public broadcaster won’t focus on innovation and platforms. It’s
  all about the content. Even the lunch offered was pared down, befitting a
  cash-strapped corporation, with assorted wraps and salads in plastic cups
  provided to the journos and his inner circle. The former Nine Entertainment
  chief wants the ABC to be easier to work with when it comes to co-productions,
  with Marks admitting it is not the broadcaster of choice for many producers.
  It goes without saying that top of his wishlist is a big global hit like
  Bluey, only he wants to retain the distribution rights this time, so the ABC
  can make some money. The BBC got the best part of the Bluey deal, leaving
  Aunty nothing but the cultural cachet and the Australian broadcast rights. A
  franchise like MasterChef was mentioned and, before the public broadcaster
  purists turn their noses up, remember that the original was a BBC show that
  became a hugely successful global export. A new hire for Aunty Another new
  face at ABC News will be Clare Armstrong, who will jump ship from News Corp to
  become the national broadcaster’s chief digital political correspondent later
  this year. Armstrong is the national political editor of the Daily Telegraph,
  the Herald Sun, the Advertiser and the Courier-Mail. She’s based in Canberra
  and is a regular on Insiders. She’ll replace Jacob Greber, who moved to 7.30
  as political editor when Laura Tingle became the ABC’s global affairs editor.
  Armstrong said she was excited about her new role. “Every decision in Canberra
  has a ripple effect across the country and I’m looking forward to breaking
  stories and providing insight and analysis on the issues that matter most to
  Australians,” she said in a statement from the ABC. The news director, Justin
  Stevens, called Armstrong a “hugely talented and highly experienced political
  journalist and an acute analyst of national politics with a track record of
  breaking news”. She’s well respected, which will hopefully shield her from any
  bitterness at News Corp, which isn’t always the biggest fan of Aunty.
