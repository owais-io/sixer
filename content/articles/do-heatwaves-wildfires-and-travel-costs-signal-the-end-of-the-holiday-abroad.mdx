  It was a prediction nobody wanted to hear. On the main stage of the world’s
  biggest tourism fair, Stefan Gössling, a leading researcher in sustainable
  transport, had just calmly announced the looming death of the holiday
  industry. “We have already entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism,”
  said Gössling, to an uneasy audience of travel agencies, car rental companies,
  cruise operators and hoteliers. That prophecy may sound fanciful to
  holidaymakers in Europe and North America who have been jetting off this
  summer – as well as to industry executives delighted to see international
  tourism return to pre-pandemic highs last year – but Gössling argues that as
  carbon pollution stokes heatwaves, fuels wildfires and ruins harvests, the
  cost of foreign travel will soar, and fewer people will be able to afford it.
  “Eighty years ago, mass tourism started in Europe,” said Gössling, a professor
  at the business and economics school at Linnaeus University in Sweden, who has
  consulted for the UN and the World Bank. “Eighty years from now, I’m doubtful
  there will be much tourism left in the world.” Gössling is not short of
  examples of destinations already feeling the squeeze. Warm weather is melting
  snow that keeps Alpine ski resorts alive. Coastal erosion is stripping sand
  from southern European beaches. Droughts are forcing Spanish hotels to ship in
  fresh water as swimming pools lie empty, while wildfires are setting scenic
  Greek islands ablaze. The South Aegean islands in Greece, which include the
  tourist favourites Kos, Rhodes and Mykonos, are the “single most critical”
  hotspot on the continent, according to a study Gössling co-authored last month
  combining exposure to climate hazards with dependence on tourism. Next are the
  Ionian islands, which include Corfu. The financial strain caused by these
  issues, which travel companies will probably pass on to customers, will be
  compounded by the rising cost of food – from coffee to chocolate to olive oil
  – and the increasing need for insurance against extreme weather. “At the
  moment, it’s locally concentrated,” said Gössling, speaking to the Guardian
  earlier this year at the ITB Berlin, the world’s largest gathering of tourism
  companies. “But in the future, it will become more frequent, cover more
  places, and turn into something disruptive.” Whether this rise in costs could
  outpace expected growth in global incomes is up for debate – some damages can
  be avoided through adaptation, though this, too, comes at a price – but
  tourists may feel the pinch even in scenarios that keep volatile weather under
  control. If carbon pollution does fall sharply – necessary to stop global
  heating – it will cost the most in sectors such as aviation, which is limited
  by physical constraints. Some governments hope to slap carbon taxes on flights
  to help finance the energy transition and compensate poor countries for damage
  caused by fossil fuels, and green groups are pushing for a frequent flier
  levy, which would increase duties for each extra flight in a year. Despite
  Gössling’s blunt assessment of the tourism industry’s efforts to decarbonise –
  “what the whole sector is doing is greenwashing” – he is seen as a crucial
  voice in the industry, with the conference billing his speech a “must-hear
  session for anyone who cares about the future of travel and our planet”. Some
  things are moving in the right direction, he added, such as hotels putting
  solar panels on their roofs and people beginning to acknowledge the problem.
  “We have a huge difficulty making the step from there to action,” said
  Gössling. “But people have realised they are running into risks, and want to
  understand business risks. The message is not welcome, but it certainly makes
  people think.” In academic circles, Gössling is best-known for studies that
  put numbers on the growing carbon footprint of tourism (8.8% of planet-heating
  pollution) and the inequality in aviation emissions (only 2-4% of people fly
  abroad in a given year). His finding that 1% of the world population are
  responsible for half the emissions from air transport has underlined
  activists’ calls for governments to make premium and business travel a
  priority. “If that group travelled half as much – which still is a lot, it
  probably would still be sufficient even for business travellers – we could cut
  [aviation] emissions by 25%,” he said. “Just by making a very tiny group
  travel a little less.” But he is also quick to counter arguments that ordinary
  people in rich countries can keep flying to far-flung places and justify it by
  pointing to even more polluting demographics. “Our headache is long-haul
  travel,” he said, mentioning gap years and Gen Z influencers who sell travel
  as an aspirational lifestyle. “Everyone sees tourism as a system, where
  governments and companies are responsible,” said Gössling. “But we are the
  system. It’s our individual actions that accumulate to global problems.”
