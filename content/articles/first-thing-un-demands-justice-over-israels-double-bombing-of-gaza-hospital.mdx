  Good morning. The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful
  killings in Gaza, including its “double-tap” bombing of Nasser hospital which
  killed 20 people, among them five journalists, yield results and ensure
  accountability. “There needs to be justice,” said Thameen Al-Kheetan, the
  spokesperson for the UN’s human rights office. He added that the number of
  journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media
  workers. Israel twice struck Nasser hospital on Monday, the last functioning
  public hospital in southern Gaza. Witnesses said the second strike came just
  as rescue crews and journalists arrived to evacuate the wounded 15 minutes
  after the first bombing, killing first responders and media workers. The
  “double-tap” strike killed journalists working for Reuters, Associated Press
  and Al Jazeera, as well as independent journalists. What does international
  law say about the attack? It may constitute a war crime on many fronts, writes
  the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont. “What is striking about this incident is that
  each individual element – the targeting of a working hospital, of journalists
  and rescue workers, of civilian injured already under treatment – would be
  expected to draw accusations of a war crime in its own right,” he writes. Who
  were the five Palestinian journalists killed? Their names were Moaz Abu Taha,
  Mariam Abu Dagga, Mohammad Salama, Ahmed Abu Aziz and Hussam al-Masri, and you
  can read their stories here. “He loved his work deeply,” said the brother of
  Abu Taha. Meanwhile, what’s happening in Israel? Tens of thousands of people
  took part in demonstrations on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of
  disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end
  the war and calling off plans to attack Gaza City. Federal Reserve governor
  Lisa Cook to sue Trump administration over its attempt to fire her The Federal
  Reserve governor Lisa Cook will sue the Trump administration over its attempt
  to fire her over unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud, her attorney has
  said. Donald Trump announced he was firing Cook on Monday night, in an
  extraordinary move that marks the latest escalation in the US president’s
  attack on the central bank’s independence. What has Cook’s attorney said?
  Trump has “no authority” to remove Cook from the Fed’s board of governors,
  said a statement. “His attempt to fire her … lacks any factual or legal
  basis.” In the meantime, Cook plans to stay put on the Fed’s powerful board of
  governors and rate-setting policy committee. Trump imposes 50% tariff on India
  as punishment for buying Russian oil Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on most
  US imports from India, following through on a threat to punish one of the
  world’s largest economies for buying discounted Russian oil. The tariffs,
  which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk
  inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and further disrupting
  global supply chains. What’s the reaction so far in India? Ministers there
  argue it has been unjustly singled out for its trade relationship with Russia
  and officials caution the country will probably work more closely with Moscow
  and Beijing – and drift further from Washington – as a result. Meanwhile,
  what’s the latest on the Ukrainian frontline? Ukraine acknowledged for the
  first time on Tuesday that Russia’s army had entered the Dnipropetrovsk
  region, a central administrative area previously spared from intense fighting.
  In other news … A portrait by an Italian master stolen by the Nazis has been
  spotted on a real estate listing in Argentina, 80 years after the painting was
  looted from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam and bought by Hermann Göring.
  Norway’s $2tn sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, is selling its
  $2.1bn stake in the US firm Caterpillar, amid what it called “extensive and
  systematic violations of international humanitarian law” by Israel using
  Caterpillar bulldozers to destroy Palestinian property in Gaza and the West
  Bank. Australia’s spy chief said the Iranian government had “fanned the
  flames” of antisemitism in Australia, alleging that Tehran directed at least
  two arson attacks, in Melbourne and Sydney, in the last year. India’s supreme
  court has ordered an investigation into a vast private zoo founded by the son
  of Asia’s richest person, over allegations of illegal wildlife imports and
  financial misconduct. Stat of the day: Gambling logos and ads seen up to every
  13 seconds during big US sports games Since the supreme court overturned a
  federal ban on sports betting in 2018, the US gambling industry has surged.
  Researchers at the University of Bristol analyzed gambling marketing during
  the Stanley Cup and NBA finals games, finding 6,282 instances across 13 games
  – and as often as 3.5 times per minute for National Hockey League games. Don’t
  miss this: ‘Cultural criticism is at risk of erasure’ Media layoffs have swept
  the industry in recent years, but a spate of recent job losses have felt
  especially targeted, writes Jesse Hassenger. The Chicago Tribune is
  eliminating the position of film critic entirely, Vanity Fair is getting rid
  of its film critic and other journalists, and the New York Times recently
  reassigned four culture critics. Climate check: Deforestation has killed half
  a million people in past 20 years, study finds Deforestation has killed more
  than half a million people in the tropics over the past two decades as a
  result of heat-related illness, according to a study in Nature Climate Change.
  Researchers estimated that warming due to deforestation accounted for 28,330
  annual deaths between 2001 and 2020. Last Thing: ‘It was like the Nasa of
  puppetry’ – how we made 1990 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The performers
  and director of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film describe how
  they battled hellish costumes and slippery sets to bring the movie to life.
