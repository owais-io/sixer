  Even by the city’s own high standards, things have been strange in Washington
  DC lately. On U street Friday night, the usual throngs of drunken party goers
  were decidedly smaller. Lines outside clubs and bars were nonexistent. The
  week prior, residents of the District watched as the reality of US president
  Donald Trump’s “crackdown” unfolded in front of them. Police set up
  checkpoints in some of their city’s immigrant strongholds and approached other
  people at random. The mere presence of the military on the streets of the US
  capital has been an uneasy sight for many longtime Washingtonians, who already
  lack voting representation in Congress and are so frequently at the mercy and
  whim of the federal government. Yet even amid this uneasiness, on that same
  Friday night, 11,691 journeyed to the south-west waterfront to watch the
  NWSL’s Washington Spirit take on Racing Louisville. In the 51st minute of the
  match, patches of the crowd at Audi Field broke into a “free DC” chant – a nod
  to the District’s long-running quest to become the 51st state. Before long,
  the entirety of the stadium joined in. The match itself was an entertaining,
  end-to-end affair. The crowd at Audi Field felt energetic and invested,
  exploding into bedlam when the Spirit’s recent prize catch – Ballon D’Or
  nominee Sofia Cantore – smashed home the opener from distance. Louisville
  later equalized and took the lead late in the match but when Spirit attacker
  Rosemonde Kouassi salvaged a draw nine minutes into second-half stoppage time,
  the entire building shook. It’s the type of response that the stadium’s
  primary tenants, Major League Soccer’s DC United, can only dream of these
  days. Mired in last place, the club has watched as the Spirit have approached,
  if not wrestled away, their grip on the hearts and minds of local soccer fans.
  In just a few short years, the Spirit have used an ownership change and an
  accompanying influx of cash and ambition to mainstream themselves in the DC
  sports scene. United, MLS’ original dynasty, have done their part to step
  aside. With the exception of a few bright moments, the club has oscillated
  between being uninspiring and downright awful over the last decade, costing
  them the goodwill of many longtime fans. NWSL clubs across the country are
  making massive inroads in terms of popularity and relevance. But there are few
  other markets where the narrowing of the popularity gap between men’s and
  women’s clubs has been made so apparent as it has in DC, where the Spirit may
  have already eliminated the gap completely. “The whiplash of vibes could not
  be further apart,” said Douglas Reyes-Ceron, co-founder of Rose Room
  Collective, a supporters group that supports the Spirit and United alike.
  “It’s reaching a point on the DC United side, where it’s so fucking dire that
  people are just walking away. The Spirit have earned so much credence and
  cache with this fanbase that it’s just a lot easier to weather the storm with
  them.” United’s last home match, which took place before the deployment of
  federal troops, also featured a protest. As they have all year, supporters in
  the stadium’s north end chanted “sell the team” – a sentiment which used to be
  muted and sometimes felt a little unreasonable, but which has now become
  impossible to ignore. Some of those fans have supported the club since its
  inception 30 years ago. In that era, it drew big crowds and won three of the
  first four MLS Cups, then won another in 2004 – the last time it appeared in
  the league’s showpiece event. While other clubs built their own stadiums and
  found new revenue streams in the mid-aughts, United struggled to do so and
  languished at the decrepit, raccoon-invaded confines of RFK Stadium. Losses
  piled up and, in 2012, the club’s longtime ownership sold to Indonesian
  businessman Erick Thohir and current CEO and managing partner Jason Levien.
  Levien joined with promises to get a stadium deal done, and he did admirably
  well in doing so, brokering the deal with the District government that got
  Audi Field built. In the meantime, he sought to limit the club’s losses.
  United stopped spending money on staff, on players, or much of anything,
  really. The club began to lose touch with longtime fans and failed to attract
  new ones. Crucially, they lost the affection of the club’s latino fanbase, an
  essential component to success in the District, where immigrants from El
  Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico make up a little more than 10% of the
  population. The club experienced a resurgence in 2018 when Audi Field finally
  opened. They brought in English legend Wayne Rooney and for a time, matches
  once again became a happening. But the club hasn’t made the playoffs since he
  left to join Derby County. Many fans are upset, but more alarming is that even
  more of them simply don’t care any more. Like United, the Spirit are a league
  original, having taken the field during the NWSL’s inaugural season in 2013.
  But unlike United, the Spirit’s path towards relevance was more gradual. The
  club had a modest and passionate following and plenty of potential, but
  fortunes turned after Steve Baldwin bought the club in 2018. In 2021, the club
  was rocked by allegations that its head coach, Richie Burke, had been abusive
  towards players. Baldwin himself was accused of nepotism and incompetence and
  his co-owner, businesswoman and philanthropist Michele Kang, called on him to
  sell the team. What ensued was something straight out of a soap opera, with
  the two trading jabs in public and private and Kang eventually emerging with
  sole control. Kang has gone on to be among the loudest, most supportive voices
  of the women’s game in the US and worldwide – since taking over the Spirit,
  she has bought majority control in OL Lyonnes in France and the newly-promoted
  London City Lionesses in the Women’s Super League. Like Levien, Kang has had
  her shortcomings as an owner, butting heads with some of her staff as she
  learns the ropes of sports ownership. But her influence is undeniable. She has
  unquestionably maximized the value of some of the Spirit’s prized players –
  USWNT megastar Trinity Rodman in particular – pumping millions of her own
  money into player care, marketing and the rest of it. Perhaps more
  importantly, the Spirit under Kang have taken concrete steps to connect with
  their fans. The club established a supporters liaison, something United still
  lacks, and has spoken out on issues in a way that many clubs – MLS, NWSL or
  otherwise – do not. Amid the current madness in DC, the Spirit did well enough
  to address it in their own oblique way – via an Instagram post reading, in
  part: “As your neighbors, we walk beside you.” “The Spirit have still had
  their share of foolishness,” said Reyes-Ceron, “But when they made the
  foundation the way it is, that foundation can withstand a lot more bullshit.
  The community surrounding the team has grown a lot bigger and a lot more
  inclusive.” They have also done something else United haven’t done: win. The
  Spirit lifted the club’s first championship in 2021 and were runners up in
  2024. When results have faltered, few could blame a lack of ambition or
  financial investment. Quite the opposite, actually: it has sometimes felt like
  half of the Spirit’s roster is missing during any given international window.
  In the meantime, United have run out of excuses. For years the club blamed its
  stadium situation for their woes, saying that losses forced them into thrift.
  When they do finally spend money, the team often wasted it on players that,
  for one reason or another, just didn’t fit. Results never improved. Watching
  the club’s most recent big-name signing – former Crystal Palace and Liverpool
  striker Christian Benteke – is simultaneously inspiring and rage-inducing. His
  often beautiful play is entirely squandered by a downright dreadful team; an
  excellent finisher who rarely gets the chance to finish. United have cycled
  through coaches (four non-interim hires since 2021), through general managers,
  through players, through front office personnel. Levien, along with co-owner
  Steve Kaplan, have added a laundry list of minority owners over the years but
  their involvement remains constant. “The only common thread remaining is
  ownership,” said Reyes-Ceron. “The fanbase feels that way. It’s concentrated
  and pointed now.” The Spirit, meanwhile, feel as if they haven’t even touched
  their ceiling. Kang is now working alongside Levien to push the DC government
  toward renovating and expanding Audi Field, which is less than a decade old.
  The Spirit have averaged over 15,000 fans a game this year, third in the NWSL,
  and they’ve sold Audi Field out multiple times in the past few years, about as
  frequently as United have. In June, a Spirit match on a Sunday afternoon
  outdrew a DC United one a night prior, a first on a shared weekend for the
  clubs. The Spirit have their own challenges. They’ve set the bar high for
  themselves, having featured Rodman and any other number of quality players.
  Like Inter Miami in MLS, the Spirit are now among the league’s
  standard-bearers. Fans of the club expect ambition and excellence, unlike
  their landlords, for whom winning at all would be an improvement.
