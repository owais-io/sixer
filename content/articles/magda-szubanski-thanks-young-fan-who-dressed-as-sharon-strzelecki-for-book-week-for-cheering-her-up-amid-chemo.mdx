  Magda Szubanski has shared an update about her health from her hospital bed as
  she continues treatment for an aggressive form of blood cancer. Szubanski,
  well-known for her roles in Kath &amp; Kim and Babe, posted a video to
  Instagram on Sunday to thank a young fan who had “really cheered me up” with
  her Book Week costume of Szubanski’s Kath &amp; Kim character, the hapless
  netball fan Sharon Strzelecki. “This is a special shout-out to little
  10-year-old Annabella in Adelaide,” the 64-year-old actor said, adding: “Thank
  you so much for your ‘impression-ation’ of Sharon Strzelecki. Sign up for our
  rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday
  morning “I’m in here having chemo and it really cheered me up. I’m really
  touched and that was a beautiful thing to do. Thank you my sweet. Lots of love
  to you.” In the caption, Szubanski wrote: “Chemo is smacking me around right
  now.” The television cook Nigella Lawson and the comedian Dawn French were
  among thousands of commenters wishing her well, with Lawson writing: “Sending
  all the love in the world to you, Magda darling.” Szubanski revealed in May
  that she had been diagnosed with stage-four mantle cell lymphoma, posting a
  video showing she had shaved her head “in anticipation of it all falling out
  in a couple of weeks” as she underwent treatment in Melbourne. She said the
  cancer had been discovered “incidentally” after she underwent a breast
  screening that showed her lymph nodes were swollen. In August she was inducted
  into the Logies Hall of Fame, with the likes of the film-maker George Miller,
  Kath &amp; Kim’s Gina Riley, Richard E Grant and the politician Penny Wong all
  paying tribute. The US comedy actor Melissa McCarthy called her “one of the
  funniest humans, one of the smartest humans”. Szubanski was unable to attend
  the ceremony, sending in an emotional taped speech instead. “Let’s just get
  this out of the way – I am not being awarded this honour because I have got
  the cancer,” she said. “I am getting this because of 40 years of hard work –
  lobbying, bribing, threatening, whatever it took. Finally it has all paid
  off.” She thanked the public for their messages of support. “The love and
  support I have felt, like a tsunami, from the Australian public has been
  overwhelming and I have to tell you, it really helps … when I go online and I
  look at those messages, every time my heart lifts and I feel that much
  stronger to deal with the cancer.”
