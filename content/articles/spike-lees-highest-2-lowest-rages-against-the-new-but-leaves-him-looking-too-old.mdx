  “We’re jazz musicians,” the director Spike Lee recently said of his working
  dynamic with Denzel Washington in Highest 2 Lowest, a new crime thriller that
  marks the fifth collaboration between the two Oscar winners. “We respect Julie
  Andrews singing My Favorite Things, but when John Coltrane did it, you know,
  or when Miles [Davis] did his standard of My Funny Valentine, it’s a different
  thing.” The metaphor is no throwaway. Since Lee’s breakout on to the cultural
  scene in the 1980s, the Atlanta-born, Brooklyn-made auteur has been at pains
  to style himself as an outgrowth of old school storytelling traditions even as
  critics tarred him as a new-school disrupter. From She’s Gotta Have It to
  Chi-Raq, Lee has made the extra effort to venerate the athletes, artists and
  thinkers who have shaped his distinctly analog worldview. Highest 2 Lowest was
  meant to be a “reinterpretation and not a remake”, he said of High and Low,
  the 1963 Japanese crime noir directed by Akira Kurosawa – officially
  acknowledged in the new film’s end credits as “the master”. But ultimately Lee
  uses his latest joint as a Trojan horse to launch fresh attacks against a
  stubborn personal bugbear: the changing times. In Kurosawa’s film, Kingo Gongo
  (the pre-eminent Toshirō Mifune) is a shoe company executive forced to choose
  between certain financial ruin and saving his chauffeur’s son when a kidnapper
  mixes up their two boys. The same premise holds true for Washington’s David
  King – the golden-eared recording mogul behind Stackin’ Hits, itself a
  composite of Stax and other Black-owned labels of lore. As in the original,
  Highest 2 Lowest introduces King as he’s staking his sizable fortune to
  execute a leveraged buyout. And like Gongo, he feels compelled to do so to
  maintain a vintage quality standard. But where Gongo hopes to stem a tide of
  cheaply made, cardboard-grade shoes, King aims to protect his towering record
  catalog against unrelenting threats from AI and advertising. Never mind that
  this particular message is being brought to you by a man who has hawked
  everything from shoes to banking to water. In Highest 2 Lowest, characters
  make jokey references to insurance commercial mascots; one of them, Allstate’s
  Mayhem (Dean Winters) even crosses over into this production. From his midtown
  high rise corner office perch, surrounded by pictures of Aretha Franklin, LL
  Cool J and other music icons, King yearns for a past when real music was
  swingin’ and makes a goal of restoring those times for the sake of a greater
  cultural good. It’s a cognitive dissonance that Lee appeared to wrestle with
  in the real-life marketing for the film. Teasers for Highest 2 Lowest
  prominently tout the rapper Ice Spice, a one-hit wonder oft-derided as an
  industry plant. But her true screen time is limited to a brief meeting at
  Stackin’ Hits HQ that sees King smile politely at her character before rushing
  off to tend to more important business. In hindsight, the ruse is clear – Ice
  Spice was just the carrot to get young viewers through the turnstiles – and so
  is the contempt dripping from the auteur and his avatar. King doesn’t just
  work backwards. He lives in a literal past. His waterfront penthouse in
  Brooklyn’s trendy Dumbo neighborhood is a monument to Black history to rival
  the Smithsonian’s African American museum. Inside the King’s split-level
  domicile, Jean Michel Basquiat’s Now’s the Time competes for pride of place
  with Kehinde Wiley’s Investiture of Bishop Harold as the Duke of Franconia – a
  supreme homage of old from new commissioned for Lee himself, one of several
  movie props derived from the director’s personal collection. Lee’s tight focus
  on the decor and intentional cutaways – from the Toni Morrison portrait on one
  wall to Shepard Fairey’s Kamala poster on another – highlights the connection
  between these significant works. Lee is just as heavy-handed about the musical
  scoring in Highest 2 Lowest, which overpowers the story at times. When the
  film opened with grand shots of the New York skyline set to a straight
  performance of Oh, What a Beautiful Morning, I figured Lee would cut it off
  after 30 seconds or 45 seconds – especially after the low-key shade he threw
  at Julie Andrews. But, no, he lets the Oklahoma! standard run through to its
  three-plus minute conclusion. This, I suspect, was done to introduce younger
  filmgoers to Norm Lewis (who made history in 2006 as the first Black person to
  play Javert in a professional English-language production of Les Misérables on
  Broadway) and urge them to revel in a level of vocal genius that once seemed
  so routinely achievable without computer assistance. The first major action
  sequence in Highest 2 Lowest, set against a Puerto Rican festival in the
  Bronx, is underscored by an indulgent live performance from the Latin jazz
  pioneer Eddie Palmieri. With every classic song choice and artist photograph,
  which aren’t limited to the black-and-white glossies tacked around King’s
  corner office, Lee prevails upon viewers the superiority of his particular
  analog tastes. Where High and Low largely concerns itself with the question of
  class, Highest 2 Lowest wonders if there are any truly original cultural
  contributions after 2004 – apparently, the last year Stackin’ Hits was
  genuinely relevant. In his film, Kurosawa also interrogates contemporary media
  praxis before dismissing the press as a group-thinking, sensationalist herd.
  But Lee takes the critique even further through King, who doesn’t just rage at
  his son’s screen addiction but names the pushers: TMZ and its Black celebrity
  gossip knockoff, MediaTakeOut. The ragebait sets King up for a showdown with
  the kidnapper, a drill rap street sensation named Yung Felon played by A$AP
  Rocky. As Felon explains, he was pushed into the random scheme after King
  ignored his attempts to reach out and share his music. The conceit not only
  ignores the psychedelic era in which hip-hop comfortably finds itself now, but
  does even more to amplify the music’s association with what behavior
  conservatives might charitably characterize as unrefined, when they’re not
  outright calling it ghetto. (They minced even fewer words about jazz back in
  the day …) When King diagnoses Yung Felon as soulless and shrugs off his
  burgeoning following, a sign that would seem to suggest there’s some intrinsic
  value and authenticity in his art, Yung Felon shoots back with live rounds and
  fulfills his no-good thug stereotype. It’s quite the turnabout from Lee’s
  seminal 1989 film Do the Right Thing, which lionized hip-hop as a voice of
  protest and community. Lee presses this point home in an interpolated music
  video for Trunks, an A$AP track that’s lent to the Yung Felon character. Lee
  situates Washington’s King amid a phalanx of twerking stripper bottoms. Given
  the nearly two hours’ worth of carefully curated cultural celebration that
  came before, the moment initially struck me as crass. (Washington turns his
  back to camera for most of the scene, as reveling in it would be seen as
  beneath an actor of his caliber.) But crass is precisely the takeaway Lee was
  going for. Disappointingly, Highest 2 Lowest forgoes the opportunity to
  provide a modern spin on Kurosawa’s class allegory. Instead, it picks up a
  harangue Lee launched in the 2000 film Bamboozled, a strident broadside
  against what he saw as the corruption of modern Black cultural expression.
  Ironically, Lee saved this forceful rejection of new school values for his
  first production made in collaboration with A24 and Apple. The film’s rising
  action is basically a long and tortured product placement sequence for
  AirPods, Maps and two middling updates to A$AP’s Music catalog. Tellingly, the
  tech is exempted from the lowbrow status assigned to the other newfangled
  ideas struggling for light in the shadow of Lee’s unimpeachable taste. That
  Highest 2 Lowest failed to net a widespread theatrical release in the
  commercial exchange ultimately goes to show what today’s culture gatekeepers
  think about him, not Denzel – arguably an even more compelling box office draw
  with retirement looming. For Highest 2 Lowest to wind down with King charting
  a new path with a classic female lounge act (Aiyana-Lee) just puts the fine
  point on Lee’s weak indictment of These Times. You just wonder how much longer
  he can carry on whingeing nostalgic like this, Grandpa Simpson-style, before
  turning into a relic himself. • This article was amended on 20 August 2025 to
  include the name of the 1963 Akira Kurosawa film, High and Low, in the second
  paragraph.
