  Arsenal have been informed that they would have to pay more than half of
  Eberechi Eze’s release clause up front to sign the England forward, with
  Crystal Palace determined not to allow him to leave for less than a fee that
  could reach up to £67.5m including bonuses. It is understood Arsenal officials
  have held initial talks with Palace over a deal for Eze, who has two years
  left on his contract at Selhurst Park. Palace are believed to have indicated
  that they are not willing to accept any bids below the 27-year-old’s release
  clause and want £35m in advance, with the rest of his initial £60m fee due in
  instalments. The clause includes up to £7.5m in add-ons and is thought to
  expire before the Premier League season kicks off on 16 August, although that
  is not understood to affect Palace’s valuation of the player they signed from
  Queens Park Rangers in 2020 for a fee worth up to £19.5m. QPR are believed to
  be due 15% of any profit Palace make on the sale. Arsenal officials are
  understood to have met with Eze’s representatives last month to discuss
  personal terms and he is thought to be keen to return to the club where he was
  released as a 13-year-old. Having committed more than £200m on six players
  during this window, Arsenal are hoping to move on several fringe players that
  could help fund a move for Eze. There is interest in Leandro Trossard from
  other Premier League clubs as well as Borussia Dortmund, with the Belgium
  forward yet to sign an extension on his deal that expires next summer,
  although Arsenal have an option to extend it by 12 months. Reiss Nelson is
  being targeted by Fulham, while Albert Sambi Lokonga, Oleksandr Zinchenko and
  Fábio Vieira would also be allowed to depart for the right price. With the
  appeal against their demotion from the Europa League due to be heard at the
  court of arbitration for sport on or before 11 August, Palace are also facing
  uncertainty over the future of captain Marc Guéhi. He is wanted by Liverpool
  but the Premier League champions have so far been reluctant to meet Palace’s
  valuation for the defender, whose contract expires next summer. Palace are
  believed to have lined up Ousmane Diomande from Sporting as a potential
  replacement for Guéhi, while they are also interested in Bilal El Khannouss of
  Leicester. But with goalkeeper Walter Benítez and defender Borna Sosa the only
  new additions to the squad so far, manager Oliver Glasner has admitted his
  disappointment at Palace’s lack of activity. “Even though all the players are
  still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far,” the
  manager told Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung during the club’s pre-season
  tour. “I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new
  players earlier this year. “As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we
  don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day
  like last year, another false start is possible”. Glasner has yet to reopen
  talks about extending his contract, which expires at the end of next season.
  Palace failed to win any of their opening eight Premier League fixtures last
  season but went on to finish 12th and picked up their first major trophy
  thanks to Eze’s winner against Manchester City in the FA Cup final. They
  return to Wembley to face Liverpool in the Community Shield on 10 August.
