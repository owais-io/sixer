  For nearly two years, Israel has been systemically targeting and killing
  Palestinian journalists in Gaza. On Sunday night, the Israeli military
  brazenly killed another six journalists, who had been sheltering in a tent
  housing media workers in Gaza City. Among them was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera
  correspondent Anas al-Sharif and the rest of the network’s team reporting from
  the besieged territory. Israel is able to kill Palestinian journalists with
  impunity not just because of the unconditional military and political support
  it receives from the US and other western powers, but also the failure of many
  western media organizations and journalists to stand up for their Palestinian
  colleagues. Western outlets are often willing to publicly criticize
  governments and campaign for journalists who are harassed or imprisoned by US
  adversaries like Russia, China or Iran. But these institutions are largely
  silent when it comes to Israel, a US ally. This shameful hypocrisy of western,
  and especially US, media has been laid bare by Israel’s targeting of
  journalists since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. Journalists have the same
  protection as civilians under international law, which considers the targeted
  killing of journalists a war crime. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)
  says that 192 journalists have been killed since 7 October – 184 of them
  Palestinians killed by Israel. Of the Palestinians killed, the CPJ found that
  at least 26 were deliberatively targeted for their work as journalists, but
  the group couldn’t determine whether others were killed specifically for their
  work. Other organizations put the number of media workers killed in Gaza even
  higher, with a recent study by the Costs of War project at Brown University
  finding that at least 232 were killed as of late March. In one of its starkest
  conclusions, the report found that more journalists have been killed in Gaza
  than in the US civil war, both world wars, the Korean war, the Vietnam war,
  the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined. You would think
  such shocking figures would galvanize news organizations and journalists
  around the world to condemn Israel’s targeting of their Palestinian
  colleagues. But US news outlets have been largely quiet, compared, for
  example, with the crusade many of them supported to free the Wall Street
  Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich after he was arrested and accused of
  espionage by Russia in March 2023. Major news organizations framed their
  reporting around the idea that Gershkovich had been wrongfully detained by
  Russia and convicted in a sham trial on fabricated charges. Yet these same
  news organizations are often unwilling to view Palestinian journalists as
  worthy of the same benefit of the doubt, and protection, against Israeli
  threats and smears. The Israeli military began threatening al-Sharif, the Al
  Jazeera correspondent killed on Sunday, in November 2023, when he reported
  receiving multiple calls from Israeli military officials telling him to stop
  his work and leave Gaza. A month later, al-Sharif’s 90-year-old father was
  killed in an Israeli airstrike on the family’s home. Israel then deployed its
  well-worn playbook, accusing al-Sharif of being a “terrorist”, as it has done
  with other Palestinian journalists that it later killed, without providing
  credible evidence. In October 2024, the Israeli military claimed that
  al-Sharif was among six Al Jazeera journalists, all reporting from Gaza at the
  time, who were current or former members of either Hamas or Palestinian
  Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera, along with press advocacy groups, viewed the
  accusations as a potential death sentence against the six journalists, one of
  whom was killed by Israel in March. The Israeli military’s smear campaign
  against al-Sharif intensified last month, after his harrowing reporting on
  Israel’s siege and starvation of Gaza went viral, including one broadcast
  where he cried on air as a woman walking behind him collapsed from hunger. (I
  recently spent six weeks in my home country, Lebanon, often watching Al
  Jazeera’s coverage, and it was clear to me that al-Sharif had become the face
  of the Gaza war for millions of viewers in the Arab world.) In fact, the CPJ
  was so alarmed by the Israeli threats against al-Sharif that it issued a
  statement last month saying it was “gravely worried” about his safety and
  urging his protection. But those pleas did not resonate in most US or other
  western newsrooms. There have been few media campaigns or statements of
  solidarity with Palestinian journalists – compared with similar efforts around
  Gershkovich and other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries. Major
  US news organizations have not published open letters in their newspapers
  calling attention to journalists who are being persecuted for doing their job,
  as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post had
  done for Gershkovich in May 2024 to mark World Press Freedom Day. Press
  freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western
  journalists. In 2022, Shireen Abu Akleh, one of Al Jazeera’s most prominent
  correspondents and a Palestinian-American, was killed by an Israeli soldier
  while reporting in the West Bank. Yet Joe Biden’s administration refused to
  hold Israel accountable for Abu Akleh’s killing. Biden’s impotence sharpened
  Israel’s sense of impunity. Once Israeli leaders realized that they would face
  no consequences for killing one of the Arab world’s most prominent
  journalists, who also happened to be a US citizen, is it surprising they would
  later conclude that they could get away with killing many more Palestinian
  journalists in Gaza? Western media outlets have made one consistent demand of
  Israel: to allow foreign reporters into Gaza, which the Israeli government has
  refused to do since October 2023, except for a few cases where journalists
  entered the territory while embedded with Israel troops. That’s an admirable
  campaign for news organizations to take on, but it has also been framed in a
  problematic way. Some western outlets and journalists seem to think that only
  foreign reporters can provide full and impartial news coverage out of Gaza. A
  longtime BBC journalist, John Simpson, recently echoed this argument, writing
  on X: “The world needs honest, unbiased eyewitness reporting to help people
  make up their minds about the major issues of our time. This has so far been
  impossible in Gaza.” That’s hogwash, and it reinforces the worst colonial
  traditions of legacy media, which view western (often meaning white)
  journalists as the sole arbiters of truth. This debate reminds me of Evelyn
  Waugh’s Scoop, in which the British novelist mercilessly skewered foreign
  correspondents and sensationalist journalism in the 1930s. Unfortunately,
  Waugh’s satire still resonates today. One of the main problems with this
  conception of western journalists as the ultimate mediators of unbiased
  reporting is that it belittles the professionalism and courage of hundreds of
  Palestinian journalists, many of whom have given their lives covering Israel’s
  assault on Gaza. The irony, of course, is that once foreign reporters are
  allowed into Gaza, most of them will rely heavily on Palestinian journalists,
  translators and other “fixers” who often do the brunt of work for western
  correspondents. That’s one secret of foreign coverage in much of the legacy
  western media: it’s built on the unseen, and largely uncredited, work of local
  journalists and fixers. With no foreign reporters allowed into Gaza,
  Palestinian journalists like Anas al-Sharif have been able to tell their own
  people’s story directly to the world. And Israel is methodically killing them
  for it, while many of their western colleagues and international journalistic
  institutions remain shamefully silent. Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop
  Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New
  York University. He is the former Middle East bureau chief at Newsday
