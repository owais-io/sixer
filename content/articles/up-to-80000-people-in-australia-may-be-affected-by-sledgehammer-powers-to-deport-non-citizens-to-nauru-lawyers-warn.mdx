  Up to 80,000 people in Australia may be affected by the Albanese government’s
  proposed powers to strip basic legal protections from the non-citizens it
  plans to deport to Nauru, refugee lawyers warn. The proposed federal powers,
  revealed last Wednesday, are expected to pass parliament this week with the
  Coalition’s support at a snap two-hour committee hearing scheduled for
  Wednesday night. The home affairs bill will deny natural justice to
  non-citizens on a removal pathway, as well as legally validate all of the
  government’s visa decisions made before the high court’s NZYQ ruling in
  November 2023 that may now be considered unlawful. It comes as the home
  affairs minister, Tony Burke, struck a $400m deal last week with Nauru to
  offload hundreds of non-citizens to the tiny Pacific nation, though the
  details of the arrangement remain a secret. The Refugee Legal executive
  director, David Manne, said the bill’s broad scope to apply to tens of
  thousands of people within Australia was an “extreme overreach” and like
  taking a “sledgehammer to a walnut”. “It strikes at the heart of fundamental
  protections under Australian law, our international obligations, and the
  values which underpin them: humanity, compassion, fairness and justice,” he
  said. The country’s peak legal body, the Law Council of Australia, has also
  raised its concerns about the level of scrutiny the bill will receive before
  its expected passing, and whether the prospect of it applying retrospectively
  is against the rule of law. The Labor government passed three bills in
  November 2024 allowing Australia to enter into financial arrangements with
  third countries to remove non-citizens without a valid visa. The government’s
  proposed legislation aims to speed up that process by removing the cohort’s
  right to natural justice, which is defined as a fair hearing and to a decision
  without bias. The NZYQ group consists of about 280 non-citizens whose visas
  had been cancelled on character grounds, and who were released from indefinite
  detention in November 2023 into the community after a high court decision.
  Legal experts warn the rules could be applied too broadly, covering thousands
  more within Australia, who fall under the category of a non-citizen without a
  valid visa. Home affairs department officials told a parliamentary hearing
  last November the cohort of those without a valid visa at the time stood at
  more than 75,000 while a further 4,500 were on bridging visa E. Those in
  community and immigration detention make up a smaller group at more than
  1,000. The Greens senator, David Shoebridge, said the proposal showed the
  Albanese government were either “completely unaware or uncaring of the fact
  that this will undermine the entire legal system”. “The government desperately
  wants to avoid oversight because these changes are just so toxic,” he said.
  “Minister Burke is running around doing his Peter Dutton impression,
  dog-whistling and punching down on migrants.” Burke said he was not sure
  whether to describe Shoebridge’s criticism “as melodramatic or just plain
  wrong”. “Saying that people who have their visas cancelled should leave the
  country is hardly new.” Burke did not respond to questions about the bill’s
  reach beyond those in the NZYQ cohort. The Human Rights Law Centre associate
  legal director, Josephine Langbien, said the bill proposed to strip an
  “essentially unlimited number of migrants and refugees of fundamental legal
  rights and safeguards”. “The government is simply asking us to trust their
  judgment about how these powers will be used. But it is critical that all
  people have a fair chance to be heard, particularly in decisions about matters
  of life and death,” she said. Jana Favero, ASRC’s deputy chief executive, said
  the government had been “blatantly misleading the public” about the bill’s
  reach, as well as its power to prevent appeals and to be tweaked without
  parliamentary approval. “By removing the most basic legal protections from
  these decisions, Labor is setting Australia on a dangerous and slippery
  slope,” she said. On Tuesday, teal and Greens MPs spoke against the bill,
  warning they were only given a 10-minute briefing last week about the proposed
  changes. The Law Council of Australia has also raised concerns about the
  bill’s timing and lack of scrutiny, its removal of natural justice and its
  retrospectivity to visa decisions prior to the NZYQ ruling, which it said
  appeared to be “contrary to the rule of law”. “The Law Council is concerned by
  the lack of advance public consultation on this bill. To our knowledge, it has
  been introduced to parliament without any prior consultation with any
  interested party,” the council’s president, Juliana Warner, said. “Even if
  legislation is considered necessary, it should be prospective and not
  retrospective in nature.” The Immigration Advice and Rights Centre boss,
  Joshua Strutt, said the changes set a “dangerous precedent” and should concern
  all Australians. Burke announced in February Nauru had agreed to offer 30-year
  resettlement visas for three men within the NZYQ cohort prompting their
  deportation. The three men still remain in Australia having lodged a series of
  appeals against their removal. The high court is expected to rule on Wednesday
  whether the government’s decision to cancel one of the men’s protection visas
  was made unlawfully.
