  Donald Trump’s 1 August tariffs deadline did what it was always intended to
  do. It kept the markets and the nations guessing amid last-minute uncertainty.
  It attempted to reassert the global heft of the United States economy to take
  on and master all comers. And it placed President Trump at the centre of the
  media story, where he always insists on being. In the event, there were some
  last-minute agreements struck this week, few of them fair or rational in trade
  terms, most of them motivated by the desire to generate some commercial order.
  Some conflicts are still in the balance. There were 11th-hour court challenges
  too, disputing the president’s very right to play the trade war game in this
  way. Even now, no one, probably including Mr Trump himself, knows whether this
  is his administration’s last word on US tariffs. Almost certainly not. That’s
  because Mr Trump’s love of tariffs is always more about the assertion of
  political clout rather than economic power. Mr Trump’s antipathy towards the
  European Union drives one example. The pact agreed by Ursula von der Leyen in
  Scotland last weekend underlines that the EU’s aspirations as a global
  economic superpower exceed its actual clout. The EU could not prevent Mr Trump
  making European goods 15% more expensive if they sell on US markets. Nor could
  it stop Mr Trump getting EU tariffs on US goods withdrawn. Equally eloquent
  about the global balance of economic power is that Mr Trump has not been able
  to force China to bend the knee in the manner of the EU. China has responded
  aggressively to Trump’s tariff threats, retaliating with tariffs of its own
  and blocking the sale of commodities, including rare-earth minerals, that the
  US most covets. Unsurprisingly, this standoff has not produced one of Mr
  Trump’s so-called deals. Friday’s deadline has been reset for later in the
  month. It would be no surprise if it was eventually pushed back further. Mr
  Trump is not imposing tariffs on the rest of the world in order to promote
  global trade or even to boost the US economy. He is doing it, in part, because
  Congress has delegated this power to him, allowing the president to impose or
  waive tariffs at will. He uses this power for many purposes. These include
  raising government income without congressional oversight and also, because
  tariffs are regressive, shifting the tax burden away from the very rich, like
  Mr Trump himself, on to the middle and working class. But economics also comes
  way down the field in the list of reasons why Mr Trump is wielding the tariff
  weapon internationally. US talks with Brazil – with which the US runs a trade
  surplus, not a deficit – have been hijacked by Mr Trump’s grievance over the
  prosecution of its former president Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overturn his
  2022 election defeat. Talks with India are deadlocked because Mr Trump wants
  to penalise Delhi for buying energy and weapons from Russia. Those with Canada
  have been hit by Mr Trump’s objections to Ottawa’s plan to recognise
  Palestine. The ultimate test of the policy, however, will indeed be economic.
  For now, financial markets appear to have decided that Mr Trump’s tariffs are
  manageable. If tariffs now raise the cost of goods on US high streets, slowing
  growth and feeding inflation, as they may, the wider market response could
  change quickly. In that event, the mood among American voters might even shift
  too. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would
