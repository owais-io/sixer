  It was a sun-soaked weekday in the West Country, and all I could think about
  was the flags. Around the sedate Wiltshire town of Devizes, they fluttered
  from trees and upstairs windows, with crude versions sprayed across
  roundabouts. In my adopted home town in Somerset, meanwhile, local desperadoes
  had vandalised a pedestrian crossing close to a school, which had sparked an
  online row, partly because they had jettisoned their paint cans down a nearby
  alley. “Apart from the paint being dumped, I applaud them,” said one Facebook
  post. There was talk of more St George’s crosses appearing at the car park
  near the GP surgery – and, in among scenes I usually associate with calm and
  quiet, a sudden and unsettling sense of mischief and menace. Such is the
  impact of Operation Raise the Colours, a campaign which seems to have begun in
  the suburbs of Birmingham. Its origins apparently lie in a few flags being
  cleared from lamp-posts as the city council tried to install LED lighting. In
  the hands of online provocateurs, that was enough to confirm stories about
  woke local bureaucrats denying people their national identity. That narrative
  has quickly ballooned, with sometimes grimly comical consequences: the
  dependably restrained Reform UK MP Lee Anderson says that any elected official
  who supports removing British or English flags “should be removed from office
  for betraying the very country they serve”, while his party’s council leader
  in Northamptonshire insists that for health and safety reasons, “we may need
  to take them down in the best interests of our residents”. That very small
  subplot is probably the only halfway amusing part of the story: everything
  else is deadly serious. Despite claims that it is all about patriotism rather
  than prejudice, what has materialised up and down the country feels like an
  unauthorised version of what the Home Office used to call the hostile
  environment, as if football hooligans have taken control of road markings and
  street furniture. And the relevant mood music is not exactly subtle. On the
  campaign’s Facebook page, there are enthusiastic looks ahead to September’s
  “free speech” rally fronted by the far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson,
  notices about looming protests outside hotels used to house asylum seekers and
  terse allusions to the usual conspiracy theories (“our masters have sold us to
  Islam … the replacement has begun”). The anti-racist group Hope Not Hate
  points to known far-right activists who are involved. Picking through it all,
  one thought repeatedly hits home – that whatever this self-styled operation’s
  apparently haphazard beginnings, it marks yet another instalment of a story
  that could not be more serious: the long march of a politics full of audacity
  and ambition, which is now reaching people and places that the left gets
  nowhere near. The result is a self-evident political emergency. For proof,
  look at Reform UK’s stubborn lead in the opinion polls, and the very real
  prospect of Nigel Farage becoming prime minister. Consider also the
  post-Brexit transformation of English Conservatism, and the fact that many
  Tories’ hopes now lie with Robert Jenrick, the aspiring leader whose recent
  visit to a protest in Epping put him in close proximity to an infamous
  far-right activist, and who has loudly endorsed Operation Raise the Colours
  (Kemi Badenoch soon followed suit, in yet another example of who is really in
  charge of her party). But also bear in mind something much more frightening:
  the fact that what is afoot goes far deeper than the manoeuvrings of
  politicians and parties. It goes into the cultural spaces where people live
  their lives. Some of this is all about the grim synergy between the right’s
  use of disinformation and provocation, and how politics has changed in ways
  that most of its practitioners seem to barely understand. In the past,
  orthodox television and what we now call the legacy media ensured that people
  who supported the merchants of hard-right ideas were exposed to arguments
  against them. But the 21st century does not work like that: radicalisation
  happens in sealed-off online spaces that operate according to their own
  deranged logic, opening a path from unthinking first steps to full-blown
  conversion. One minute you might be spraying the road just for the likes; the
  next, you could be disappearing into a mob surrounding a mosque. From the
  outside, that is a very difficult cycle to break. But that is not to say that
  no one should try. At the moment, the new right’s bark is probably worse than
  its bite: once again, compared with all the talk of mass uprisings and social
  breakdown, this weekend’s hotel protests were a thoroughly damp squib. But one
  of the most depressing aspects of this summer has been the sense of
  progressive forces so dumbfounded and confused by what is happening that they
  seem almost completely unable to respond, and a feeling that many people in
  positions of power now accept that ridiculous proposition that England is now
  the country Farage et al say it is. The Labour party, needless to say, either
  meekly echoes Farage’s talking points or makes the laughable claim that people
  shouldn’t support him or his party because of his views on the NHS. Even the
  trade unions, whose workplace reps and conveners presumably understand
  people’s support for the new right as a matter of everyday experience, are
  bafflingly quiet. And what of any fight on the terrain of popular culture?
  Older readers will recall a rightward cultural shift and the brief surge of
  the National Front in the late 1970s, which was met by the inspirational work
  of Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League, choking off the far right’s
  appeal to the young. I can well remember the anxiety and alarm triggered by
  the surge in popularity of the fascist British National party, which happened
  twice: 15 or so years ago, when it was undone by dogged Labour campaigning and
  its own ineptitude, and circa 1994, when the election of a single BNP
  councillor in east London sparked a huge anti-racism concert, acres of
  coverage in the music press and the revival of Rock Against Racism’s old
  spirit. I know: that was a very long time ago, and comparing then with now
  risks ignoring how much popular culture has since been diluted and weakened.
  But there are still musicians with huge platforms and devoted fans, and
  organisations – such as Love Music Hate Racism – ready to play their part. The
  prominence of Palestine flags at this year’s festivals proves that music’s
  radical edges have not been completely blunted; even the most apolitical
  artists surely understand that what they do is a product of exactly the kind
  of cultural mixing and open attitudes that the new right wants to squash.
  Something else keeps nagging at me. Up until a few years ago, we heard a lot
  of talk about progressive patriotism, a new vision of England that was truer
  to 21st-century reality, and the final wresting away of symbols of nationhood
  from people with the most malign and nasty ideas. It was right that we did:
  the fact that these conversations never really went anywhere might be one of
  the reasons we are in such a mess. The noise the new flag-wavers make is
  getting louder; there are increasingly brazen links between thugs and
  supposedly mainstream politicians that need to be called out. This is what
  defines the urgency and fear of this summer: as the Clash long ago sang in a
  peerless and prescient piece of music titled Clampdown, what are we going to
  do now? John Harris is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the
