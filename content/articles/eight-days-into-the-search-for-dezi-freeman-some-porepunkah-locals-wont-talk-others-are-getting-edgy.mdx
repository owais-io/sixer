  Glen Siede and his son Nick White are standing under the base of Mount
  Buffalo. The sky is clear, the river is up, and there is fresh snow on nearby
  slopes. Normally, the caravan park they run would be filled with people
  sitting along the banks, kids playing in the park, and mountain bikers
  returning after a morning on the trails. “Right now, we don’t want people in
  the park,” Siede said. He points upwards to where a police helicopter has been
  circling for the last hour. The caravan park they run is just hundreds of
  metres away from the property where Dezi Freeman allegedly shot and killed two
  police officers, wounding a third. Sign up: AU Breaking News email There has
  been no official sighting of Freeman as the search for the gunman entered its
  eighth day. After spending 24 hours in lockdown, locals in Porepunkah have
  tried to go about their normal lives as convoys of police conduct raids in
  houses around the area, and large swathes of bush are cut off by roadblocks.
  Normally a tourist town, a gateway to the alpine region, Porepunkah is now
  full of police and journalists. Many locals won’t talk – they know Freeman or
  his wife, Mali. They’ve had the media in town for the week, and they’re over
  it. But everyone is still speculating – where he is, why they haven’t found
  him yet, and whether it’s safe. “I don’t think he would come for us,” one
  woman, who did not want to be named, said. Others, like the Siede and White,
  are starting to worry about their livelihoods. “Usually we’ve got cars
  flooding past and people popping into the park, even in the quiet times, but
  it’s been completely dead,” White said. “Even when I went into Bright, there
  is usually people walking down the street, but there’s no one. It’s the
  quietest I’ve ever seen the supermarket as well.” On Tuesday afternoon, police
  visited properties in Wangaratta, closing off the road and going from door to
  door. In Porepunkah, at least two raids were carried out on properties, with
  police returning to a home they had searched late last week. For several hours
  in the afternoon, the roadblock near Freeman’s old home was back up. Police
  again swarmed the property, with two Bearcat vehicles and the special
  operations group searching the surrounding area while a helicopter flew
  overhead. In the main strip of Bright, police set up a “mobile facility” for
  community members to drop in and share any information they have on Freeman
  and his whereabouts. Police believe people in the community are helping him.
  On Monday, Supt Brett Kahan said people knew where Freeman was hiding and
  asked anyone with any information to come forward. Immediately after the
  shooting, Siede moved everyone staying at the park out, and has been offering
  refunds or credits for those with bookings in the coming days. School holidays
  are starting at the end of the month, followed by the AFL Grand Final weekend
  – typically two of their busiest times of year. “We’ve got school holiday
  bookings,” he said. “But we don’t know whether to be open or closed. The
  police won’t tell us anything.” Normally at this time of year, the influx of
  tourists the snow brings is starting to thin. But blizzard conditions over the
  weekend meant Hotham was hit with 77cm of soft fresh snow. “Normally we would
  be seeing a few more tourists coming through the town, especially the ski
  shop,” said Ben Foster, who works at the shop. “Especially after we’ve had an
  absolute bump of snowfall like we just had over the weekend.” He said visitors
  had “dropped straight off a cliff” – with people ringing to cancel bookings.
  On local Facebook groups, many people are asking which stores are open and
  what the safest way to get to the snow is. Almost ironically, Foster said he
  had never felt safer living in Bright. “There’s police everywhere,” he said.
  The small number of snow lovers who have made it up the mountain have almost
  had it to themselves, with no lines and fewer people on the runs, he said.
  “The snow is amazing,” Foster said. “And there’s another front coming within
  about eight days, I think another 20 to 30cm potentially.” He said any help
  the government could offer to businesses would “be fantastic”, especially as
  the last two snow seasons had suffered from poor weather. A spokesperson for
  the Victorian government said they were working with the council and
  businesses to “understand the impacts” of the incident. “What has occurred in
  Porepunkah is shocking and heartbreaking,” the spokesperson said. “Our
  government stands with the community of Porepunkah who are now carrying the
  weight of this horrific incident and with Victoria police and the emergency
  services who are still responding to this unthinkable crime.” On Wednesday,
  council-run facilities across the area, including libraries, visitor
  information centres, transfer stations and the customer service centre in
  Bright, will open again. The Alpine Shire mayor, Sarah Nicholas, did not
  respond to a request for comment, but in a Facebook video posted on Monday,
  said she had visited Porepunkah. “It’s great to see the camaraderie that the
  community members are showing towards and between each other,” Nicholas said.
  “It’s a really strong community, and it’s wonderful to see how they’re
  managing through this crisis.” She reminded the community to stay vigilant and
  said the council was working on “support services” to help people, but did not
  say what they would be.
