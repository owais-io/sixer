  Simon Jenkins offers some interesting thoughts on the style of the future
  monarchy when Prince William becomes king (As William moves to Forest Lodge,
  an era of pushbike royals beckons. Will that save the monarchy?, 21 August). A
  good start would be to repeal the Act of Supremacy that currently binds the
  sovereign to the role of supreme governor of the Church of England. The future
  monarch should be free to choose their own religion, this being more
  representative of multicultural Britain. As constitutional monarchs, William
  and his wife should continue to set good examples to the nation of living
  worthwhile lives. There is also the representational role of head of state in
  entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries. These are very demanding roles that
  require a reasonable amount of downtime to live a normal family life away from
  intrusive media coverage. The sovereign needs some support from their
  immediate family, and it would be reasonable to offer royal status for up to
  four supporters and partners, who meet the required standards and are willing
  participants. The choice of Forest Lodge as a principal residence in the
  private part of the Windsor Great Park should be ideal for privacy, but is
  also conveniently located to attend formal state events at Windsor Castle. The
  handing over of Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace to Historic Royal
  Palaces also makes sense, with the balcony at Buckingham Palace still being
  available as a focal point for major state events in central London. Finally,
  there is the matter of the private estates at Sandringham and Balmoral. As
  there is an acute shortage of affordable housing to rent in the UK, it would
  be a sensible gesture for the royal family to convert both of these estates
  into trusts to fund the provision of affordable housing developments for
  rentals around the UK. Balmoral in particular has lots of scope to increase
  revenue from visitor ventures. Bolthole properties on both estates could be
  retained for the exclusive use of the royal family. Ian Graham Port Carlisle,
  Cumbria • What to do with Buckingham Palace? Perhaps a better answer to Simon
  Jenkins’ suggestion would be to convert the palace and its great garden into a
  fit-for-purpose, modern Houses of Parliament with all necessary services and
  outbuildings, and turn the present dilapidated and unsuitable Westminster
  complex into a fabulous public centre serving as a museum, art gallery and
  national forum at the foot of Big Ben. Christopher Lucas Former director,
  Royal Society of Arts • Simon Jenkins’ article on the potential redundancy of
  the royal palaces particularly mentions Buckingham Palace and its private
  gardens. Earlier articles have highlighted the need for the Palace of
  Westminster to be restored at a cost of billions of pounds and the decision on
  whether to decant or restore around function. It has been mooted previously,
  but discounted due to the ongoing restoration of Buckingham Palace (now almost
  completed), but there is a strong case for it to become home to at least the
  House of Lords. There is a delightful precedent in the Luxembourg Palace in
  Paris, which is the home to the senate and the Luxembourg Gardens that are
  open to the public. Tony Orchard Exeter • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
