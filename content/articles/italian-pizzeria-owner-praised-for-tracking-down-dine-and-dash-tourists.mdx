  An Italian pizzeria owner has been praised for her bravery after managing to
  track down a pair of “dine and dash” tourists and handing them the bill. The
  French women had enjoyed pizza and a few glasses of Aperol spritz at Ai Due Re
  pizzeria in Civitanova Marche, a town on the Adriatic coast, racking up a €44
  bill. But they left without paying. Michela Malatini, the pizzeria’s owner,
  told local media the pair arrived without a reservation and had ordered two
  pizzas and four spritzes. “When it was time to pay, they got up and slowly
  walked out of the door,” she said. They might have got away with it, except
  for surveillance cameras and the power of social media. Malatini shared a CCTV
  image of the pair on Facebook and, via those who commented on the post, she
  was soon able to trace them to their lodgings at a holiday apartment in the
  town. This was not the first time Malatini’s pizzeria had encountered “dine
  and dashers”, but on this occasion she was not prepared to let them get away
  with it. Early the next morning, she went to the apartment and knocked on the
  door, waking the women up before presenting them with their bill. “The two
  women were very helpful and immediately handed over the money without the
  slightest protest,” Malatini told Cronache Maceratesi. “It’s not about the
  money; we don’t like being taken for a ride. Unfortunately, such episodes are
  happening more and more often. We can trace them through the surveillance
  cameras, so it’s not easy to get away with. And, after many years of
  experience, you can intuit who intends to leave without paying,” Maceratesi
  added. She also emphasised how hard her staff worked and that seeing customers
  attempting to get away without paying for their food “is a slap in the face
  for our work”. Malatini was lauded for her “brilliance” and “bravery” by
  commenters on Instagram. “You did good!” one wrote. “Dine and dash” is a
  growing problem in other European countries too. In July, UK restaurant bosses
  spoke out about its financial and mental impact. In Italy, the dashers tend to
  be tourists. In July, a couple of young visitors to a restaurant in Verbania,
  Piedmont, left without paying the bill only to have to make an embarrassing
  return because one had left his mobile phone on the table. By that point, the
  restaurant owner had called the police, who were there to greet them.
