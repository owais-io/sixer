  On a late Friday afternoon, after a week of wintry rain, the residents of
  Macleay Street in Sydney’s Potts Point are walking their miniature dogs past
  neat piles of crunchy plane tree leaves on the footpath. People are browsing
  the windows of antique stores and bookshops. Old world cafes offer enticing
  pastries. The late afternoon sun winks through the narrow gaps between art
  deco apartment buildings. Elderly neighbours, tipped in leopard print
  (leggings/scarf), greet each other. It’s a serene scene. “All this was way
  grottier when I first moved here with my wife Khym years ago,” says Richard
  Fidler, the radio host and author. In those days, he says, it was bikers,
  cocaine dealers and “angry drunk dudes” who came in from the suburbs, cruising
  around in cars. “And if they didn’t find what they wanted, they looked for
  someone’s head to punch in – or something even more heinous.” One night,
  Fidler recalls, someone tried all the buzzers at the entrance to his apartment
  building. “You’re lying in bed, thinking what’s going on? Then when the buzzer
  went off to my apartment, the dude says, ‘Where is she, mate, where is she?’
  I’m thinking, ‘Oh, God’ but I said, ‘She’s safe with us now.’ ‘Ah, ya fuckin’
  bastard!’ he says.” Fidler, 60, an author and former punk rock comic is
  perhaps most familiarly known as the founding voice of Conversations, an
  hour-long interview show and podcast that is broadcast across Australia on ABC
  radio. (He now shares the hosting chair with Sarah Kanowski.) The podcast has
  built a colossal following over 20 years, with tens of millions of downloads
  each year. Walking around the leafy streets, no one seems to recognise Fidler.
  They may recognise his voice though. In person, he sounds very much as he does
  on the radio – impeccably modulated, friendly, bemused, reassuring,
  occasionally incredulous. On the show he asks people about their lives using
  what boils down to a mix of careful research by his team, active listening and
  wry humour. “I’m driven by authentic curiosity,” he says. “Some people make
  podcasts that are just a couple of people shooting the shit. I actually hate
  those because there’s a kind of contempt for the audience.” Sign up for a
  weekly email featuring our best reads Choosing his words carefully, Fidler
  admits that he doesn’t normally talk to someone for an hour in his private
  life – not even his wife. “It’s rare to talk to someone uninterrupted for a
  full hour,” he says. “It’s eye contact, curiosity and knowing when to keep
  your mouth shut.” As it edges towards sunset we slip into a cafe. He orders a
  sparkling water and tells me he wants to talk about something he hasn’t spoken
  of publicly before. “I disappeared for three months late last year and I’m
  finally ready to talk about it,” he says. With no warning or fanfare, he
  simply stopped appearing on Conversations from October to December. “A lot of
  people thought I’d left the show because I didn’t announce anything, I didn’t
  want any fuss. But basically, my wife was diagnosed with cancer – a
  nasopharyngeal tumour, right at the back of the nasal passage where it meets
  the throat.” Khym and Fidler have been together 34 years, married for 32. One
  morning she woke up with a “very nasty” nosebleed and went for a biopsy. “Khym
  is Singaporean Chinese by birth but moved to Melbourne when she was nine. I
  learned it’s a condition that’s really prevalent in south-east Asia. No one
  knows why. It was certainly news to me.” Fidler took carer’s leave while Khym
  underwent 13 weeks of chemotherapy alongside seven weeks of daily radiation.
  It all finished up on New Year’s Eve. “It was pretty brutal,” Fidler says.
  “It’s one of those treatments that is extremely punishing but extremely
  effective at the same time. But the radiation left her neck very inflamed and
  it destroyed her taste buds – temporarily, fortunately – and caused major
  damage to the saliva glands. “We had to wait three months for the heat of the
  chemo and radiation therapy to cool down and see how well it worked.” In March
  Khym’s oncologist declared her cancer-free. “‘Pristine’ was the word he used
  about her scan,” Fidler says, smiling. “It’s a really lovely word to hear from
  an oncologist. Yeah, so she’s going to take a while to fully recover but she’s
  going to be fine.” The couple met in Melbourne when she was working as an
  actor on the TV series DAAS Kapital, a show he helped create as part of the
  anarchic comedy trio the Doug Anthony All Stars, alongside Paul McDermott and
  Tim Ferguson. He says it was very much love at first sight, for him at least.
  “I remember she came out of the ABC in Ripponlea, and she’d taken all her
  makeup off and was waiting for a taxi,” he recalls. “It was one of those rare
  days where some Melbourne late-afternoon sunshine sort of hit her in the face.
  She put up her face to smile into it and that was it, I was gone.” She did not
  share the love-at-first-sight moment, he quickly adds. “But on the first date
  we discovered we had watched the same Countdown episodes, and read the same
  Penguin Classics and we had CDs and records in common, and on the second date,
  I learned she’s an amazing cook. She cooked a completely authentic French
  bouillabaisse, which I’d never had before, and that, combined with the CDs and
  the books, I thought, ‘I’m going to have to marry her.’” “Love at first sight
  is profoundly shocking, on the one hand, because you know everything’s about
  to change but then you have this strangely comforting, familiar thought, ‘Oh,
  it’s you.’” Now, at 60, he still thinks of himself and Khym as a young couple.
  “But we’re not young any more – the cancer has made us reflect on our
  mortality. Now we want to travel as much as possible.” Over the next hour in
  the cafe, Fidler talks exuberantly about his great love of history and travel,
  twin passions that led him to write his popular nonfiction books. The first
  was about the 1,000-year history of Constantinople, after a trip he took with
  his then 14-year-old son. He has taken a deep dive on Prague, explored the
  history of the voyagers of the Abbasid empire and studied the bloody and
  mysterious Icelandic sagas. His next book will be about Mesopotamia. “I had to
  get older before I could start writing books,” he says. “I had to know a lot
  more about people before I could become a writer and I had to read more before
  I could think laterally about historical subjects. “Ever since I was a kid, I
  wanted to know how history worked and what followed what and where my tiny
  little speck of a life fits into that great stream of events and people
  through the centuries.” Do you know where you fit in now? “Oh yeah. I’m a very
  grateful speck living in a peaceful and prosperous democracy. Yes, I know
  there’s plenty of things that’s wrong with Australia. It’s built on this mass
  dispossession and attempted genocide, and yet it’s an unusually peaceful,
  democratic, prosperous nation.” The cafe is closing but Fidler is still
  ruminating on Australia’s history and whether democracy is a natural state for
  humans or something to be tended like a garden. “I think it’s very hard for
  Australians to hold those two ideas in our heads at the same time, so we’ll
  tend to lunge to one or the other. But I think it’s essential to hold both
  those ideas at the same time. What we have is worth defending, and it’s built
  on this monstrous crime.” He finishes his water and thanks the cafe staff.
  Walking out into the early evening, his first thought is of his wife.
  “Hopefully I can persuade her to come out and dine with me. That would be
  lovely.” Conversations Live: Unexpected, Unmissable, Unforgettable is touring
