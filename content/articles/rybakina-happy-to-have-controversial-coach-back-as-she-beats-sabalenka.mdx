  Elena Rybakina has described herself as satisfied by the return of her coach
  Stefano Vukov as she produced an imperious performance at the Cincinnati Open,
  dismantling Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1 and defending champion, 6-1, 6-4
  to reach the semi-finals. Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, put together
  a performance of the highest quality on Friday afternoon as she served
  efficiently and completely overpowered one of the most destructive shotmakers
  in the world. Until the past few weeks, Vukov had been banned from coaching at
  WTA tournaments and the grand slam events after the WTA found that he had
  engaged in abusive conduct towards Rybakina. His suspension was lifted upon
  appeal, allowing him to train with and support her onsite throughout the past
  two weeks in Cincinnati. “It’s great that he’s here in the box, finally, so
  it’s a good thing,” she said. Since Vukov’s suspension, Rybakina had
  repeatedly expressed her frustration about the ban and she was critical of the
  WTA. After he was provisionally suspended in January pending the outcome of
  its investigation, Rybakina said: “I don’t agree with a lot of things what the
  WTA do in the sense of my relationship with Stefano. As I said before, I have
  never made any complaints or any of these things. I always said that he never
  mistreated me.” Although he was banned from receiving credentials to
  tournaments, Vukov continued to train with Rybakina away from events. She has
  been working with the Italian former player Davide Sanguinetti since February.
  This week, Vukov and Sanguinetti have been providing her with advice in
  training and matches. During her post-match press conference, Rybakina opted
  not to speak in depth about her work with Vukov. Asked about how helpful it
  has been to have him onsite again, she responded curtly: “It’s always a help
  when the whole team is here with me.” Another significant match awaits
  Rybakina as she rekindles her rivalry with the third seed Iga Swiatek, who
  remains in excellent form since her Wimbledon victory and defeated the 28th
  seed Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-4 to advance into the semi-finals. Later on
  Friday, the men’s second seed Carlos Alcaraz held firm against a quality
  performance from Andrey Rublev, the 11th seed, as he narrowly reached the
  semi-final with a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 win. “Today I maintained the positive thoughts
  all the time even though I lost focus a few times in the match in the second
  set,” said Alcaraz. “That game serving that he broke me, I lost a few points
  that playing in matches against someone like Andrey, when you lose the focus
  for two or three points, it costs you the set or almost the match.” Although
  Alcaraz has not been at his best this week in Cincinnati, he continues to show
  his growing maturity in the decisive moments. Here, Alcaraz initially appeared
  to weather the storm as he broke serve for a 5-3 third-set lead but he missed
  a slew of first serves as he attempted to serve out the match and quickly
  found himself back at 5-5. Despite missing his first opportunity, Alcaraz
  maintained his composure and closed out the victory. Alcaraz will face either
  Ben Shelton or Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals. He and Jannik Sinner are
  again one round away from facing each other in what would be their fourth
  consecutive final against each other.
