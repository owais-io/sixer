  When British forces commemorated the liberation of Brussels for the first time
  in 1945, they left a unique gift – a replica Welsh guards uniform for the
  Belgian city’s emblematic “peeing boy” statue, the Manneken Pis. Now 81 years
  after the Welsh guards freed Brussels from Nazi occupation, the gift has been
  renewed: the Manneken Pis has a new regimental uniform, including scarlet
  jacket embroidered with gold lace, gleaming white belt and authentic bearskin
  hat. At a ceremony in the gothic town hall on Wednesday, the Welsh guards
  warrant officer Chris Greaves presented a tailor-made uniform for the bronze
  sculpture, including the belt decorated with a leek and replica sword crafted
  by the specialist supplier, Pooley Sword. The bearskin hat was made from
  repurposed headgear from the regiment’s collection. The uniform was first
  presented by one of his predecessors on 29 July 1945, amid cheering crowds,
  but after nearly eight decades had become too fragile to use, meaning the
  Manneken Pis was not dressed in the costume on the 80th anniversary of the
  liberation last year. Lt Col Guy Bartle-Jones, regimental adjutant of the
  Welsh guards, said the regiment wished to preserve the tradition “because a
  lot of sacrifice was made by our regiment to liberate Brussels in 1944 and we
  have such a good connection with the city of Brussels and Belgium that we want
  to continue that tradition.” “It means a lot to us to maintain that because
  it’s part of our legacy and our heritage and we want to preserve it,” he told
  the Guardian. At about 7pm on 3 September 1944, Lt John Dent of the Welsh
  guards drove the first allied tank into Brussels, after a lightning-fast
  advance of about 100 miles from Douai in northern France the day before. The
  streets of Brussels were at first deserted, as residents heeded an order to
  stay at home. But the allies faced sniper bullets on the city’s outskirts and
  violent clashes took place near Nazi command offices, as retreating Germans
  fought local resistance fighters and allies. Exactly 81 years later, a small
  contingent of Welsh guards accompanied by British and Belgian dignitaries
  processed the short distance from the Hôtel de Ville to the Manneken Pis under
  grey drizzly skies, accompanied by the Brussels police band’s rendition of the
  popular wartime song It’s a Long Way to Tipperary. Belgium takes
  commemorations of the world wars fought on its soil very seriously. It is the
  only non-commonwealth country that is permitted to remember its war dead at
  the London Cenotaph. Geoffroy Coomans de Brachène, a member of the Brussels
  parliament who represented the city at the ceremony, said he was honoured to
  welcome the Welsh guards and recognise their past sacrifice. He said it was
  important for the next generation to understand what really happened, citing
  internet misinformation circulating among young people. “Some of them right
  now think that Hitler was a great guy. Some of them think that Germany won.”
  The Welsh guards outfit is the 1,184th costume of the Manneken Pis, a
  collection that includes traditional dress of dozens of regions and countries,
  police and medical uniforms, as well as characters from James Bond to Mickey
  Mouse. The 58cm tall statue, a self-deprecating symbol of Belgium and a draw
  for thousands of tourists, has been dressed up for centuries. The first
  costume was a gift from French King Louis XV to make amends for his soldiers’
  theft of the statue in 1747. According to one legend, the statue pays tribute
  to a child that urinated on the burning fuse of enemy forces attempting to
  blow up the city walls, saving the city from disaster. Now the little boy has
  new clothes, which Coomans de Brachène described as “a symbol of friendship
  between Brussels and the United Kingdom”.
