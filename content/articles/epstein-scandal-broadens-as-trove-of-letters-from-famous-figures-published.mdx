  The long-running scandal surrounding the disgraced late financier and
  convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein broadened on Tuesday after the New York
  Times published a trove of previously unseen letters to Epstein from numerous
  powerful figures as well as unseen photographs from inside his Manhattan
  mansion. The letters, written to Epstein by a number of high-profile
  individuals, were reportedly compiled as a birthday gift for Epstein’s 63rd
  birthday in 2016. Their publication comes amid intense speculation around
  Donald Trump’s ties to Epstein, who was found dead in a New York jail in 2019
  and had long cultivated a celebrity social circle of the rich and powerful. In
  one letter, former prime minister of Israel Ehud Barak and his wife wrote
  “there is no limit to your curiosity.” “You are like a closed book to many of
  them but you know everything about everyone,” they wrote, describing Epstein
  as “A COLLECTOR OF PEOPLE”. They continued: “May you enjoy long and healthy
  life and may all of us, your friends, enjoy your table for many more years to
  come.” In a letter from film-maker Woody Allen, Allen reminisced about
  Epstein’s dinner parties at his Upper East Side townhouse and described the
  gatherings as “always interesting”. He noted that the parties included
  “politicians, scientists, teachers, magicians, comedians, intellectuals,
  journalists” and “even royalty”. Allen also described the dinners as “well
  served”: “I say well served – often it’s by some professional houseman and
  just as often by several young women” who he said reminded him of “Castle
  Dracula where Lugosi has three young female vampires who service the place.”
  Other letter writers reportedly included billionaire media mogul Mortimer
  Zuckerman; Noam Chomsky and his wife; Joichi Ito, the former head of the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab; physicist Lawrence M
  Krauss; and Harvard biologist and mathematician Martin Nowak. Allen, Ito,
  Zuckerman and Nowak did not respond to requests for comment from the Times.
  Barak reportedly declined to comment, and Chomsky’s wife responded on his
  behalf, also declining to comment. Krauss reportedly told the Times that he
  didn’t recall the letter but did attend “several lunches with very interesting
  discussions” with scientists, authors and others at Epstein’s house. In
  addition to the letters, the Times also published photos from inside Epstein’s
  seven-story Manhattan mansion. In his office, the images show a taxidermied
  tiger and reportedly show a green first edition copy of Lolita – the
  controversial 1955 novel about a middle-aged man’s sexual obsession with and
  sexual abuse and rape of a 12-year-old girl – which the Times said was
  “showcased”. Surveillance cameras can be seen in Epstein’s bedroom and an
  adjoining room. In his “massage room”, where many underaged victims said that
  they were sexually assaulted by Epstein, the Times reports that there were
  paintings of naked women, shelves of lubricant, and a large silver ball and
  chain. Elsewhere in the house, dozens of framed photographs show Epstein
  pictured alongside longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently
  serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. They also pictured
  Epstein with notable figures such as Pope John Paul II, Mick Jagger, Elon
  Musk, Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Richard Branson, Saudi Arabia
  crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and former Trump White House adviser, Steve
  Bannon. One frame also displayed a dollar bill signed by Microsoft co-founder
  Bill Gates with the message “I was wrong!” which the Times said was “possibly
  as payment of a bet”. The Times also reported that the home’s entryway
  featured framed prosthetic eyeballs, and that a suspended sculpture of a woman
  wearing a bridal gown and clutching a rope hung in the central atrium.
  According to the Times, a map of Israel drawn on a chalkboard that had the
  signature of former Israeli prime minister Barak was also in the home. Epstein
  died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal
  sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. The renewed scrutiny
  into Epstein’s case comes as Trump and members of his administration had
  repeatedly vowed to release information related to the Epstein investigations.
  But in July, the administration reversed course, and the justice department
  announced it would not release any further documents or details regarding the
  case, prompting bipartisan outrage, including from Trump supporters and
  conservative media figures. Epstein’s case has long been the subject of
  countless conspiracy theories, in part due to his ties to powerful people. His
  2019 suicide has also fueled conspiracy theories for years. The justice
  department’s recent announcement also reignited scrutiny of Trump’s years-long
  friendship with Epstein. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump
  allegedly wrote Epstein a birthday card as part of a 50th birthday album
  organized by Maxwell in 2003. According to the report, Trump’s letter featured
  a sketch of a naked woman with Trump’s signature. Trump denied the Journal’s
  report and sued the newspaper for libel. Around a week layer, the Journal
  reported that justice department officials had informed Trump earlier this
  year that his name appeared in the Epstein files. The paper noted that being
  mentioned in the records isn’t a sign of wrongdoing. Trump’s spokesperson
  denied the report, calling it “fake news”. Facing growing pressure, the
  justice department sent Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general and one of
  Trump’s former lawyers, to meet with Maxwell in late July to see whether she
  had “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims”. The
  meeting, which lasted two days, was held behind closed doors. On Friday,
  Maxwell was transferred from a Florida prison to a lower-security facility in
  Texas.
