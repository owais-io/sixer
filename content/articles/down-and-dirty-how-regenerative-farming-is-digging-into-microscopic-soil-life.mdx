  Nick Padwick hunches over a microscope, examining a sample of compost he has
  made on his Norfolk farm. “Look at that bad boy! That’s a bacteria-feeding
  nematode!” he exclaims. “Stunning fungal hyphae.” Padwick, the farm manager at
  Wild Ken Hill since 2018, is part of a growing movement of farmers taking a
  deep interest in the microscopic life forms that their livelihoods depend
  upon. Under this approach to regenerative farming, nurturing diverse soil
  communities – from bacteria and fungi, to microscopic animals and worms – is
  seen as an essential prerequisite for growing healthy foods with minimal or no
  use of agrochemicals or soil-damaging machinery. For Padwick, 59, this marks a
  dramatic shift after nearly four decades in conventional agriculture, the very
  systems that experts now blame for devastating soils worldwide. “I really have
  been a part of it,” he admits. “I cringe every time I think of it.” The stakes
  could not be higher. Recent estimates show more than 60% of EU agricultural
  soils are degraded, with around 40% of UK soils similarly damaged. Globally,
  the UN Food and Agriculture Organization says 90% of the world’s topsoils
  could be at risk by 2050; a crisis intensified by accelerating global heating.
  All this has implications not just for food security, but biodiversity, water
  quality, flood mitigation, climate resilience and greenhouse gas emissions. As
  put by the Lancaster University soil ecologist and author Prof Richard
  Bardgett: “Few things matter more to humans than their relationship with the
  soil.” A key inspiration for Padwick’s mission to revive his land was the soil
  microbiologist Dr Elaine Ingham. Through her Soil Food Web School (SWFS), he
  learned that a fully functional soil food web is needed to build structure,
  nourish plants and fight pests naturally. That web includes a vast array of
  bacteria, fungi, protists, and tiny animals, such as nematodes and
  springtails. Ingham’s approach is based on three key actions: Use microscopy
  to identify missing or imbalanced soil organisms. Create nutrient-rich compost
  from farm waste, such as straw and wood chips. Put this compost in mesh bags
  and steep them in water, like giant tea bags, to make extracts that can
  reintroduce beneficial microbes to depleted soils. Farmers must then adopt
  management practices that protect these newly introduced organisms, allowing
  them to thrive and multiply. Scientists broadly accept the value of diverse
  soil ecosystems. “Having worked on this topic for decades,” says Bardgett, “I
  would say a more complex soil food web can only be a good thing for plant
  growth and resilience.” His scepticism, however, centres not on the principle
  but the practice; specifically, whether organisms from dilute compost extracts
  actually survive and thrive when introduced to new soils. Prof Duncan Cameron,
  a soil biologist at the University of Manchester, said he shared those doubts
  initially. But after reading Ingham’s work, he decided to test the hypothesis
  that beneficial soil ecosystems can be transplanted from compost extracts into
  soils. He partnered with Daniel Tyrkiel, aN SFWS graduate who founded the Soil
  Ecology Lab in Hampshire, which sells compost products, and soil analysis and
  consultancy services to a growing network of regenerative farmers. Their
  preliminary greenhouse tests last year yielded promising results, not yet
  published. Barley and wheat treated with Tyrkiel’s compost extracts
  outperformed control crops. Field-scale trials this year will measure not just
  yields but several soil health indicators. Bardgett, however, warns against
  viewing compost extracts as a quick fix. “My own view would be that it’s
  better to change the soil environment first, to make it more amenable for the
  organisms already in the soil to actually flourish,” he says. Otherwise “most
  [of them] will simply die.” Padwick has embraced this holistic approach. While
  he uses compost extracts, he recognises they are just one element in a
  comprehensive system overhaul. He minimises mechanical cultivation, which
  disrupts soil fungi and larger organisms; plants diverse cover crops to
  nourish soil biology year-round; and maintains unusually wide field margins
  for biodiversity. These wild areas harbour beneficial predators that control
  agricultural pests. Recent evidence suggests they can also help sustain vital
  mycorrhizal fungi networks. A critical challenge for many farms transitioning
  to regenerative farming is that yields can drop sharply, at least in the short
  term. After eliminating chemical inputs, Padwick’s wheat production plunged
  from more than 7 tonnes per hectare to 1.5 tonnes/ha, before rising again to
  more than 3 tonnes/ha. Yet his business remains profitable because his input
  costs have been slashed and he sells premium products under the Wildfarmed
  brand, launched by the Groove Armada musician turned farmer, Andy Cato. And he
  is convinced yields will continue to rise as soil health improves: “It’s going
  to be another five years before we really start seeing how things can change.”
  Perhaps the strongest evidence of the soil food web approach gaining traction
  is its adoption by G’s Fresh Ltd, an intensive horticulture company
  headquartered in Cambridgeshire. “We are set on transitioning to regenerative
  farming practices entirely across the organisation by 2030,” the product
  director, Julius Joel, says. G’s Fresh produces 1.2bn packs of salad annually,
  supplying two-thirds of the UK’s lettuce and celery demand as well as
  supermarkets across Europe. Its retail contracts demand consistently
  high-quality crops with precise delivery schedules. Yield reductions are not
  an option. “We want to have our cake and eat it,” Joel says. “We’re aiming to
  improve resilience, enhance water infiltration, cut input costs, reduce
  emissions and grow profits. We think regenerative agriculture is going to do
  positive things in all these areas.” The soil food web approach has even
  reached large-scale dairy production. Yeo Valley, the UK’s largest organic
  dairy business, has incorporated key principles into its established system.
  The Soil Ecology Lab has undertaken microscopy and soil analysis, andseeds
  have been treated with compost extracts before drilling. “Putting biology and
  food right in the seed bed … it has really helped us with the establishment of
  roots,” Will Mayor, the farms development manager. says. “That’s got to be a
  benefit, and particularly when you’re going into a tough season like this one
  … it can cope with weather extremes.” Although, he notes, “You can’t reinvent
  agriculture. There is science to it. You have to fertilise [the soil], you
  have to make sure it’s healthy, and you have to suppress weeds in order to
  grow crops.” This tension between cutting-edge practice and scientific
  validation is something Bardgett recognises. Many regenerative farming
  practitioners are “racing ahead of the actual evidence base”, he says. “In
  some ways this is a good thing, because farmers are actually just going ahead
  and doing stuff.” He emphasises that scientific research must catch up in
  order to inform policies that can effectively promote soil health. Cameron
  goes further. “The government needs to actually wake up and realise that … the
  money that they’ve thrown at [improving soil health] is not even a sticking
  plaster.” Rather than being seen as a tangential problem, he believes boosting
  soil health is “the absolute front and centre of battling climate change”.
  “This needs to be seen as a national security issue,” he says, “every bit as
  much as dealing with Putin.”
