  Utah is being thrust into a national battle over redistricting. A court
  ordered the state this week to redraw its congressional map for the 2026
  midterm elections, and the new district boundaries could make one of Utah’s
  four congressional seats competitive for Democrats as the party fights to
  topple the Republican party’s slim majority in the House. Meanwhile, Donald
  Trump is pushing Republican-led states to add winnable US House seats for the
  Republican party. Here’s what to know: The current map Utah’s current
  congressional map was adopted by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature
  in 2021 and divides heavily populated Salt Lake county – an island of
  Democratic support in an otherwise red state – among all four congressional
  districts. The four congressional districts converge within a couple blocks in
  the Salt Lake City suburb of Millcreek. A voter could grab a milkshake at the
  beloved Iceberg Drive Inn and cross into all four districts before it melts.
  Lawmakers presented the map as a way for each representative to serve both
  urban and rural areas. One district spans the entire eastern border of the
  state and groups vastly different communities, from the winter resort town of
  Park City, to the urban center of Provo, down to the red rock recreation hub
  of Moab. Voting rights groups that challenged the map argued it intentionally
  dilutes the Democratic vote and produces Congress members who aren’t suited to
  represent all of their constituents. Before the map was adopted in 2021, one
  district had traded hands between Democrats and Republicans. All have since
  elected Republicans by wide margins. The court’s ruling District court judge
  Dianna Gibson on Monday declared the map unlawful because the legislature had
  circumvented an independent redistricting commission established by voters to
  ensure districts don’t deliberately favor a party, a practice known as
  gerrymandering. Voters in 2018 narrowly approved a ballot initiative that
  created the commission to draw boundaries for Utah’s legislative and
  congressional districts, which the legislature was required to consider.
  Lawmakers repealed the initiative in 2020 and replaced it with a law that
  transformed the commission into an advisory board that they could choose to
  ignore. The following year, lawmakers disregarded a congressional map proposal
  from the commission and drew one of their own. The Utah supreme court said the
  legislature is extremely limited in changing laws passed by voters and sent
  the case back to Gibson to decide the map’s fate. “How district lines are
  drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected
  representatives or erode public trust, silence voices and weaken the rule of
  law,” she wrote in the ruling. What’s next Gibson has given lawmakers until 24
  September to adopt a map that complies with voter-approved standards. Voting
  rights advocates who were involved in the legal challenge can submit alternate
  proposals. The tight deadline for lawmakers to draw new maps could push them
  to reconsider proposals from the independent redistricting commission that
  they had ignored after the 2020 census. Those plans create a compact district
  combining the Democrat-heavy cities of Salt Lake City and Park City, while
  grouping other cities geographically. Republican leaders could cut their
  losses by creating a single left-leaning block, or gamble on creating
  competitive districts that Republicans will fight to keep. Republican
  officials could also use appeals to try to run out the clock before a
  candidate filing deadline in early January to possibly delay adopting new maps
  until 2028. The US supreme court is unlikely to intervene, and the state
  supreme court may be hesitant to entertain an appeal after it already asked
  Gibson to decide. What voters are likely to say Registered Republicans
  overwhelmingly outnumber registered Democrats in the state. However,
  voter-registration data doesn’t paint the full picture. Only about 12.3% of
  Utah voters are registered Democrats, but more than triple that number voted
  for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. About 29% are
  unaffiliated, and many voters in the state who hold liberal beliefs choose to
  register as Republicans to vote in the primaries and have a say in intra-party
  matters. That uncertainty may create complications for Republicans as they
  navigate rapidly redrawing boundaries that shield their seats while complying
  with stricter standards. How this fits into the national picture? The ruling
  throws Republicans a curveball in a state where they expected a clean sweep
  while they’re working to add winnable seats elsewhere. Trump has urged
  governors to take up mid-decade redistricting before the midterms, when the
  sitting president’s party tends to lose seats. In Texas, a plan awaiting the
  approval of the governor, Greg Abbott, includes five new districts that would
  favor Republicans. Ohio Republicans already were scheduled to revise their
  maps to make them more partisan, and Indiana, Florida and Missouri may choose
  to make changes. Some Democrat-led states say they may enter the redistricting
  arms race, but so far only California has taken action to offset Republican
  gains in Texas.
