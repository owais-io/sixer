  People using the weight loss jab Mounjaro have been warned against switching
  to black market sellers or bulk buying after its manufacturer announced the UK
  will get a significant price rise this autumn. The US pharmaceutical company
  Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro, recently announced plans to increase the
  price of the medication in the UK by as much as 170% from September. The move
  follows pressure from the US president, Donald Trump, to cut medication prices
  for Americans. Eli Lilly has said the NHS will be shielded from the price
  rise, but with few people eligible for access through the health service, most
  purchase Mounjaro privately. One month’s supply of the highest dose costs
  about £200 through many online pharmacies and is now expected to go up. Henry
  Gregg, the chief executive of the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), said
  the rising cost of Mounjaro had caused understandable concern to patients and
  pharmacies alike. “We’d urge patients to avoid bulk ordering Mounjaro as well
  as buying the medication at massively reduced prices,” he said. “Bulk ordering
  can have a significant impact on supply and pose a potential risk to patient
  safety. We’d also urge patients to avoid unlicensed sellers, who may be
  selling fake medication or medication that does not meet UK safety standards.
  “Instead, we’d encourage them to speak to their prescriber, who can support
  them with any concerns they may have and provide them with the safe care they
  need.” Many readers have contacted the Guardian to say they are devastated by
  the price rise, with some already stocking up on Mounjaro amid fears they will
  be unable to afford the new prices. Rose*, 48, from Suffolk began taking
  Mounjaro in October 2024. She has since lost about 2.5 stone (15.9kg) and no
  longer experiences constant thoughts about food. Rose currently pays £202 a
  month for the maximum maintenance dose of 15mg a week and said she was
  horrified by the price hike. “When I saw that, my heart just dropped, because
  I thought: ‘Oh gosh, how am I going to be able to justify the expense?’ Are
  there other things that maybe I need to cut back on to be able to then afford
  this additional cost?” she said, adding she currently had enough Mounjaro for
  another eight weeks and had ordered a further month’s supply. The impending
  Mounjaro price rise has led to some online pharmacies reporting a surge in
  interest in Wegovy – a cheaper but less effective weight-loss jab produced by
  the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, who said it “currently have no
  plans of changing our offering in the UK”. Graham Thoms, the chief executive
  of Pharmadoctor, a provider of clinical service packages to pharmacists, said
  Mounjaro accounted for 98% of all weight loss treatments provided by its
  nationwide network of partner pharmacies, adding the company had been
  inundated with queries from both pharmacists and patients who were equally
  concerned about the pending price increases. “The main query we are receiving
  from pharmacists is asking Pharmadoctor for guidance how to safely switch
  patients from Mounjaro to Wegovy should Mounjaro become price inhibited for
  patients,” he said, adding pharmacists had also been asking whether or not
  they could provide patients with several months’ supply of Mounjaro at the
  same time so that they could keep the price down. “Our response is that would
  not be clinically appropriate,” said Thoms, noting patients needed to have
  face-to-face consultations every four weeks to ensure the medication remained
  right for them, review goals and receive wraparound support. However, Thoms
  suggested the Mounjaro price rise might not be as drastic as the latest
  announcement suggested, noting his company’s partner pharmacists had been
  invited by their wholesalers or Lilly to participate in a rebate scheme. “We
  understand from those discussions that our partner pharmacies will need to
  purchase Mounjaro at the new higher prices from September, but will be able to
  claim back a rebate at the end of the month so long as they pass on the
  discount to patients,” he said. One online pharmacy, Chemist4U, has warned
  against microdosing with Mounjaro – a trend found on social media sites such
  as TikTok – noting it can undermine treatment and raise the risk of
  infections. The company said it is urging patients who are concerned about
  affording their treatment journey to switch to Wegovy, noting it saw a 5,000%
  increase in Mounjaro prescription requests over the weekend the price rise was
  announced and a 1,500% increase in patients switching to Wegovy. But Sukhi
  Basra, who runs a pharmacy in Victoria in central London and is the vice-chair
  of the NPA, said patients could not simply jump from one drug to another. She
  said her biggest concern was around patients that were very stable or halfway
  through their weight-loss journey, adding many had benefited mentally,
  psychologically, physically and emotionally. “I know with some of my patients,
  [who] were already struggling with the current prices, that it would be really
  difficult for them to then, at such short notice, to be able to implement or
  budget for those kind of changes,” she said. “They’ve benefited from the
  medication, but they don’t necessarily sit in the remit of the NHS patients
  that are funded for it, because obviously, the NHS can’t fund for everything.”
