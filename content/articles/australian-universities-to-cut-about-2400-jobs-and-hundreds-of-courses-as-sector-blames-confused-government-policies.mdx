  Hundreds of university courses within teaching, languages, archaeology and
  media are among those being slashed as the tertiary sector pushes back against
  “confused” government policies. Almost half of Australia’s universities have
  restructured in the past year, leading to the merging or disbanding of more
  than 50 schools of study and drastic reductions in course options for
  students, particularly in the humanities. The University of Wollongong is
  cutting a string of disciplines including cultural studies, languages,
  archaeology and linguistics, while the University of Tasmania will merge its
  school of humanities and social sciences, combine politics and international
  relations into a single major, and no longer offer German. Southern Cross
  University is discontinuing undergraduate degrees in contemporary music, art,
  design and digital media. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Australian National
  University, which on Wednesday said it would announce no further involuntary
  redundancies as part of its ongoing “Renew ANU” process, has so far proposed
  merging or shutting the schools of music, sociology, crime and social justice,
  political science, international relations and public policy. It will also
  close the Australian National Dictionary Centre, the Humanities Research
  Centre, the Centre for European Studies and the ANU School of Music. Its
  vice-chancellor, Prof Genevieve Bell, said the university was facing an
  “incredibly challenging period”, adding: “Living outside our means is not a
  responsible financial position.” Guardian analysis based on data provided by
  every university bar the ANU forecasts the total figure of job losses to occur
  by 2027 at around 2,400 across 15 institutions. About 143,000 people worked in
  the sector as of 2024, according to the Department of Education – equating to
  a cut of about 1.6% of the workforce. About 847 staff have already been made
  redundant nationwide, including 218 at the ANU and 259 at the University of
  Southern Queensland. The proposed cuts across the sector include up to 400
  positions – or a 10th of the workforce – at the University of Technology
  Sydney (UTS). Last week UTS temporarily paused student enrolments for nearly a
  fifth of its courses in business, design, engineering and IT, health, law and
  science as it pursued $100m in cost cuts. Sign up: AU Breaking News email That
  followed the release in June by Macquarie University of a draft proposal
  showing 42 full positions in the faculty of arts and 33 in science and
  engineering would be cut alongside almost 40 mergers and curriculum
  reductions, discontinuing majors in politics, gender studies, media and
  performing arts. A spokesperson for Macquarie said the proposals were in
  response to “long-term challenges shaping higher education” and more detail
  would be made public soon. The CEO of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy,
  said universities were “understandably” in a difficult financial position
  because of a decade of “successive and consistent” changes to policy and
  funding settings, with research investment falling to a record low. “Chronic
  underfunding and confused policy settings are holding universities back,” he
  said. “We’ve called for … increased funding for research, a fairer student
  funding system that doesn’t punish students or universities, growth for our
  international education sector and financial support for campus
  infrastructure.” The University of Newcastle needs to save $20.6m annually
  while Charles Sturt University (CSU) has announced it will cut its operating
  budget by $35m by the end of 2027. The exact number of job losses at each
  institution has not been announced. “As distressing as this decision is, it
  should not come as a surprise,” the vice-chancellor of CSU, Prof Renée Leon,
  said. “In recent years, the Australian university sector has been in crisis …
  jeopardised by needlessly restrictive and unsupportive government policies.
  “Charles Sturt has been hard hit by the loss of international students and has
  no indication from government that it will receive a fair share.” The
  president of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU), Dr Alison Barnes,
  said the cuts would have a “devastating impact”. She said they followed 4,524
  redundancies during 2020 and 2021. “It’s a shortsighted strategy,” Barnes
  said. “In almost every case [the cuts] are completely unjustified. No
  consideration is given to the enormous damage this does to the institutions,
  the colleagues that are left behind and the student experience.” Barnes said
  the fact the federal government recently increased the international student
  intake for 2026, and has flagged that a new funding model will be established
  under the recently commenced Australian Tertiary Education Commission, showed
  that bad management – not policy settings – were driving cuts.
  “Vice-chancellors [are] taking home an average of $1m a year,” Barnes said.
  “Poor workforce planning is a symptom of the broken governance structures that
  unaccountable university leaders operate under.” The minister for education,
  Jason Clare, said the federal government would be advised by an expert council
  on university governance when he met with his counterparts in October, which
  would address the remuneration of executives. On Tuesday, he announced that
  the commonwealth would strengthen the powers of the tertiary sector’s
  regulator for the first time since its establishment. “If you don’t think that
  we’ve got challenges with university governance, you’ve been living under a
  rock,” Clare told an AFR summit on Tuesday. Other vice-chancellors said
  existing policy settings, including the Morrison-era jobs-ready graduate (JRG)
  program, which increased the cost of humanities degrees, urgently needed an
  overhaul. At the University of Canberra, where 200 positions and some
  strategic programs have been cut, the vice-chancellor, Bill Shorten, said it
  was “imperative” the federal government scrapped the JRG program and improved
  university funding. “When humanities students of 2025 are paying double that
  paid by a student who graduated in 2019, and [they are] facing the additional
  challenges of cost-of-living and placement poverty … it is hardly a draw
  card,” he said. A spokesperson for Western Sydney University also called for
  the JRG package to be scrapped. WSU expects to cut 300 jobs and have an $80m
  deficit next year. “The cost of degrees is limiting access and participation,
  disproportionately affecting … students from low socioeconomic backgrounds,”
  they said.
