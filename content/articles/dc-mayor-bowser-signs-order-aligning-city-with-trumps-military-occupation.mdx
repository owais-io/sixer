  Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, appeared to bow to Donald Trump’s
  military occupation of the nation’s capital on Tuesday, signing an executive
  order that formalizes cooperation with federal forces even as residents push
  back against the city’s takeover. The Tuesday order establishes the “Safe and
  Beautiful Emergency Operations Center” – borrowing from Trump’s own branding –
  to institutionalize collaboration between city officials and various federal
  agencies including the FBI. On Wednesday, Bowser pushed back against
  accusations that she’s willing to continue Trump’s federal takeover. “I want
  the message to be clear to the Congress, we have a framework to request or use
  federal resources in our city,” Bowser told reporters during a press
  conference. “We don’t need a presidential emergency.” The comments come as
  Trump’s 30-day takeover is set to expire on 10 September. “Let me tell you,
  without equivocation, that the mayor’s order does not extend the Trump
  emergency,” she added. “In fact, it does the exact opposite. What it does is
  lays out a framework for how we will exit the emergency. The emergency ends on
  September 10.” The Pentagon previously said the national guard troops deployed
  to Washington will remain “until law and order is restored”. The more than
  2,000 troops could stay through December to continue service member benefits,
  according to a senior official who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity,
  although the mission may not last until then. Bowser’s executive order
  mandates that federal officers adhere to transparent policing practices,
  requiring them to avoid wearing masks, display clear agency identification,
  and provide proper identification during arrests and public encounters. But DC
  residents have criticized Bowser for opting for collaboration with the federal
  government over resistance. Polling from late August shows only 17-20% of
  residents support the federalized policing or armed national guard presence.
  Troops have been visibly patrolling tourist areas, metro stations and transit
  hubs rather than high-crime neighborhoods, and some unarmed troops have been
  assigned beautification tasks such as trash collection rather than
  crime-fighting duties. Washington residents have organized a resistance to
  fill the void left by the muted local government response. Free DC, a
  grassroots coalition that has campaigned for home rule since the 1990s, has
  soared as a central organizing force – staging nightly “noise protests” with
  pots and pans at curfew and launching an “Adopt a Curfew Zone” program to
  protect the most heavily patrolled neighborhoods from what they describe as
  federal occupation meant to strip the district of its autonomy. The
  organization gained tens of thousands of new followers on Instagram over the
  last few weeks. Grand juries – composed of DC residents – have also refused to
  indict defendants in at least six cases, nullifying federal prosecutions
  through community defiance, including the case of the now-infamous “sandwich
  guy” who threw his Subway snack at an officer and was later tracked down and
  arrested. Residents in neglected neighborhoods such as Congress Heights have
  also condemned the military deployment’s focus on protecting tourists while
  ignoring their communities, instead pushing for local investment. A federal
  judge this week ruled that Trump’s similar national guard deployment to Los
  Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement
  in civilian law enforcement, potentially undermining the legal foundation for
  the DC operation. Trump has so far claimed substantial results from the
  operation, posting on Truth Social that “Carjacking in DC is down 87%” and
  that “ALL other categories of crime are likewise down massively” along with
  1,599 arrests and 165 illegal weapons seized as of 1 September, according to
  the attorney general, Pam Bondi. On Tuesday he called DC a model for other
  states and in an Oval Office meeting said he would be “honored” to take a call
  from the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, to send national guard troops to his
  state. “I would love to have Governor Pritzker call me,” Trump said. “I’d gain
  respect for him and say we do have a problem, and we’d love to send in the
  troops because, you know what, the people they have to be protected.”
