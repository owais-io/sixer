  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 3rd (NB: this is not necessarily Will
  Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season: 3rd
  Prospects Plenty of money, about £300m, has been spent over the past eight
  months to get City back on track after a disastrous season by their standards.
  They finished a distant third and lost the FA Cup final, leaving them
  trophyless. The latest crop of incomings got a brief taste of life under Pep
  Guardiola at the Club World Cup and all showed promise. After Rodri missed
  most of last season, it feels as if his fitness will decide the fate of the
  team. If Guardiola can get him back to his best – and keep him fit – after a
  horrible injury, then City can feel excited once again. Guardiola has
  indicated City need to adapt to the evolution of football, having struggled
  with the increase in physicality and fitness that has blunted their skills.
  There could be a greater emphasis on dribbling past opponents to try to open
  up the spaces. Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Jérémy Doku and Savinho will be
  extremely important in a post-Kevin De Bruyne world. City struggled more than
  ever when it came to breaking down teams last season and Guardiola felt his
  team were unable to cope with the physicality of others. It will be
  interesting to see who gets the nod in goal on the opening weekend. Ederson
  has been Guardiola’s No 1 for years, but the arrival of James Trafford could
  change that. The Brazilian has redefined the position and Trafford, a former
  City academy player, is part of a new generation who followed his strategy and
  have attempted to replicate his ability to distribute the ball short and long.
  Trafford is young and not the finished article, but he has all the qualities
  to be a world-class goalkeeper for years to come. At the other end, Erling
  Haaland will be as dangerous as always, with fitness the only question mark
  hanging over him after some disruptions. Unlike this time last year, Guardiola
  has a second striker he can all upon if needs be in Omar Marmoush. The
  Egyptian was integral in reigniting City’s season after arriving in January
  and should be fully settled, giving them extra dimensions. The manager Pep
  Guardiola took last season personally, upset with himself for failing to
  arrest the slide and irritated by underperforming players. He will not accept
  a similar showing this season, especially after the sizable outlay on
  reshaping the squad. Guardiola overhauled his coaching staff, with the most
  eye-catching appointment being Jürgen Klopp’s former No 2 Pep Lijnders, who
  joins as an assistant coach. The change in personnel will bring new ideas,
  something Guardiola was seeking as he sought a refresh on the pitch and in the
  dugout. Off-field picture Those pesky charges just will not go away for
  Manchester City and the Premier League. It feels as if this situation has
  dragged on since Adam was a lad and rivals will continue to use it as a stick
  to beat the club with, while City plead innocence and claim a witch-hunt. No
  one is satisfied with the state of affairs and everyone will want finality as
  soon as possible because it is a constant distraction. A freeze on ticket
  prices brought some goodwill after lengthy criticism of the club’s desire to
  squeeze every penny they could out of supporters. Star signing It is a
  positive that City finally have a proper left-back in Rayan Aït-Nouri, but
  Rayan Cherki is the more exciting acquisition. The 21-year-old has been linked
  with top clubs since his teenage years, but City finally got their hands on
  Lyon’s attacking midfielder, who falls into the maverick category. He
  dribbles, creates and scores goals, while also possessing the ability to
  produce the unpredictable with the ball at his feet, and he can play in
  numerous positions behind a striker. It is hard to predict what he will do
  next, which will concern defenders. In an era when football is prescribed,
  Cherki can be the rule breaker. Stepping up A year ago, Oscar Bobb scored in
  the Community Shield to signal he was about to break out. He had enjoyed a
  great pre-season and Guardiola was confident in his qualities. The highly
  rated Bobb was the reason City were happy to part with Cole Palmer, thinking
  they had someone who could surpass him in their ranks. Unfortunately for Bobb,
  he broke a leg in training and required a lengthy rehabilitation period,
  taking longer than anyone expected, meaning he made three Premier League
  appearances, all as a substitute. There is greater competition in the
  positions he wants to play, but given a chance he could be a star turn. A big
  season for … By his own admission, 2024-25 did not live up to Phil Foden’s
  high standards. From claiming the Professional Footballers’ Association’s
  player of the year award for the previous season, Foden dropped off
  dramatically. He attributed the problems on the pitch to various factors,
  including facing challenges “off the pitch mentally” and it is understandable
  that those affected his ability to perform. The 25-year-old is a generational
  talent, possessing everything his manager wants in a player, and he will be
  desperate to show it. Given the correct freedom, he should be the man leading
  the latest incarnation of Guardiola’s football and a new era at City. • This

  surname.
