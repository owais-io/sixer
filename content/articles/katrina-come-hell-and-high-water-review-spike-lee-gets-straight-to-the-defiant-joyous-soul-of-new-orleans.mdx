  It’s hard to quantify the significance of Hurricane Katrina: the combination
  of a historic natural disaster and cold systemic indifference towards its
  impoverished African American victims makes it perhaps the most significant
  event in 21st-century Black American history. It’s no surprise, then, that
  more than one major documentary series has been made to mark 20 years since
  wind, water and a whole lot of racism devastated New Orleans, or that leading
  cinematic auteurs of two consecutive generations, Spike Lee and Ryan Coogler,
  have each executive-produced their own. But watching Katrina: Come Hell and
  High Water, you do wish Lee and Coogler had got on the phone to check they
  weren’t doubling up too much. The new three-parter – the Lee one that arrives
  on Netflix to coincide with the week of the anniversary, has its impact dulled
  by the pre-existence of Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time, the Coogler one
  which came out on Disney+ and National Geographic a month ago. For much of the
  screen time, this is a less comprehensive rendering of the same story, using
  many of the same clips and interviewees. That tale is essential, however, and
  powerfully told. Katrina, a Category 5 hurricane on a scale that goes up to 5,
  hit New Orleans on 29 August 2005. An order to evacuate the city came late,
  and many residents with limited economic means didn’t have a way of getting
  out anyway. New Orleans is a bowl, with much of it below sea level; floodwalls
  and drainage canals had been built to protect against storm surges, but they
  were inadequate and, after the hurricane struck, entire neighbourhoods
  flooded. With many dead – 1,392 at the final count – and thousands effectively
  refugees in their own city, help was unbelievably slow in arriving: the local
  authorities were unprepared, and George W Bush’s national government seemed
  simply not to care. Come Hell and High Water is more impassioned and elegiac
  than the detailed but still furious Race Against Time. Here we have a less
  robust timeline of events as Katrina approached, and a narrower picture of why
  New Orleans was so vulnerable. But this film is better at conveying the
  unimaginable horror of the rapidly rising waters, and is strong, too, on the
  racism that pervaded the media and political elites’ reaction to the
  aftermath: as people dying of thirst took supplies that were lying in
  abandoned shops, the line quickly became that “looting” was out of control and
  that “order” had to be restored. As is demonstrated here, similarly stricken
  white people would not have received the same treatment. None of that was
  absent from the other show, though. Your best advice is to watch Race Against
  Time instead of the first two episodes of Come Hell and High Water. Come back,
  though, for the closing documentary feature directed by Spike Lee: a rich oral
  history of the city in the two decades since the hurricane, this film rattles
  off the myriad injustices that continued to devastate New Orleans after the
  waters receded, as reported by creative figures such as the actor Wendell
  Pierce and the musician Branford Marsalis, among Katrina survivors. We hear
  how the city’s unique culture was deliberately and methodically prevented from
  reasserting itself, starting with insurance companies and banks ruthlessly
  taking what they said they were owed. A federally funded rebuilding drive was
  weighted in favour of wealthier areas, assigning money based on buildings’
  previous values. Public services were markedly underfunded. Black teachers
  were laid off. Many local residents, notably the Black middle classes, left
  for Atlanta or Houston. These and numerous other issues – rising crime leading
  to boom time for privatised prisons, gentrification turning Black areas into
  white ones – are rather hurled at the viewer with scant evidence or context.
  The overall point is very clear and there is no reason to doubt any of the
  angry assertions made; it would just be nice to hear more about each one
  before we pivot to the next. The only editorial device the director employs,
  the flashing up of key phrases from the interviews as captions that appear as
  the person says them, feels patronising and oddly flippant. Lee is finely
  attuned, however, to how the spirit, the culture, the soul of a city can
  survive the worst hardships, so he ends on a note of defiant joy. New Orleans,
  he tells us, is coming alive again, and refusing to be a template for the
  destruction of any community that doesn’t conform. Come Hell and High Water is
  a stirring tribute to what has been lost and what has been stolen, but it
  assures us that New Orleans will never be gone, even if it will never be the
  same. Katrina: Come Hell and High Water is on Netflix now.
