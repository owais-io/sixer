  Passengers have been evacuated from Brisbane domestic airport and flights have
  been delayed after a fault with a single metal detector prompted both
  travellers and staff to be rescreened by security. Pictures on social media
  showed large crowds at the airport, with one person saying the “entire place
  has ground to a halt”. In a statement on Monday, the airport said all people
  within the terminal were being rescreened “due to a technical fault with a
  single metal detector”. “The fault was quickly identified and there is no
  safety or security threat,” the statement said. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email “However, it will take some time to rescreen all passengers and staff,
  delaying flights.” One passenger, Craig MacLean, said everyone had boarded his
  3.40pm flight to Cairns when they were told there had been a security breach
  and the entire domestic airport was being evacuated. “There were thousands and
  thousands all funnelling outside,” he said. “Now [they’re] all outside and
  waiting on the process of everyone having to come back through.” Everyone
  stayed calm, but there was mass confusion as people were told to come forward
  for screening but then turned away by security, he said. “It’s a nightmare
  trying to navigate to the screening area because there are just so many people
  here.” Another traveller, Zachariah Kelly, was on the first flight to take off
  to Sydney and said the delay was around two hours and 30 minutes. “We were
  already all boarded and waiting for about 40 minutes before the captain told
  us to get off,” he said. “There wasn’t much panic at the outside of the
  airport, but there was a lot of confusion – nobody really knew what was going
  on until [Brisbane] put out that statement on a technical fault with a
  scanner.” The airport said it apologised for the inconvenience and thanked
  passengers for their patience and understanding. Brisbane’s international
  terminal is not affected by the issue, the statement said. On Friday, the
  airport announced it had become the first airport in the world to complete a
  security assessment under a new International Air Transport Association
  program. The certification involved an airport site visit in June and a full
  audit of its aviation security, according to the airport’s website. The
  airport, Australia’s third-busiest, has direct connections to 62 domestic
  destinations.
