  Good afternoon. Victoria police believe people are helping harbour alleged
  Porepunkah gunman Dezi Freeman, saying some members of the community know
  where the fugitive is. Speaking to media on Monday afternoon, Supt Brett Kahan
  said Freeman’s network was “wide” and asked those who know where he is to come
  forward. “You are committing an extremely serious crime by harbouring or
  assisting in the escape of Dezi Freeman,” Kahan said. “People know the
  whereabouts of the person who has allegedly killed two cops. People have
  chosen, for whatever reason, not to come forward, and I’m taking this time to
  appeal to you to come forward in that respect.” Top news Neo-Nazis attack
