  Paddleboarders, dogs jumping in, people swimming – all enjoying our local
  river (Devon campaigners call for ‘right to riverbank’ after finding Dart has
  108 owners, 29 July), but our kingfisher family have disappeared, and otters
  no longer seen. Let’s leave much of our riverbanks to the natural world, which
  we are destroying so fast. Elaine Fullard Oxford • As an expat Millwall
  supporter I took exception to Jonathan Freedland’s comparison of Millwall fans
  with a murderous, vengeful nation like Israel (1 August). It had a humorous
  side, but this jarred when thousands of humans are being killed and injured.
  Peter Skinner Corvallis, Oregon, US • If Edinburgh University should unadopt
  the unworkable International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of
  antisemitism (Letters, 29 July) it could do no better than use Stephen
  Sedley’s: “Antisemitism is hostility towards Jews as Jews.” Seven words; no
  argument. Rosalind Clayton London • “He is so chill,” says the mother of a
  baby born from an embryo frozen in 1994 (Report, 31 July). I’m not surprised.
  Toby Wood Peterborough • In response to your article (Neanderthals were not
  ‘hypercarnivores’ and feasted on maggots, scientists say, 25 July), Joan
  Clibbon’s book Cooking the British Way quotes Daniel Defoe on how stilton was
  served thick with mites and maggots, which were eaten with a special spoon.
  Lorna Bushell Lichfield • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
  publication in our letters section.
