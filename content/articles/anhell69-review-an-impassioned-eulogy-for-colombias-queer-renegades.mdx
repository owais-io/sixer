  The best kind of goth is the Latino goth. That much is clear throughout this
  documentary lament for the Colombian city of Medellín, for which director Theo
  Montoya narrates his elegy from within a casket. Luckily, he is still alive –
  unlike eight of the doomy-looking LGBTQ+ renegades who speak about their lives
  on camera here, having killed themselves or died of drug overdoses since
  filming. It is implied they are victims by proxy of a kind of ambient
  socio-cultural violence that is a hangover from the cartel days. Partly
  constructed out of audition interviews with actor hopefuls, Anhell69 is the
  remnant of Montoya’s unfinished movie, of which we see extracts: it takes
  place in a dystopian Medellín in which the preponderance of the dead and a
  lack of cemetery space has led to red-eyed phantoms walking the streets. These
  revenants also enjoy horny hookups with living humans, an outbreak of
  “spectrophilia” that the authorities crack down on. It’s an amusing, camp
  metaphor for something in plain sight: the disdain and harassment that the
  city’s LGBTQ+ population undergo daily. First among this band is the
  21-year-old Montoya has picked out for the lead role: doe-eyed Camilo, whose
  soft-smiling nihilism draws him in. Collaging his abandoned film, candid
  insights from his queer comrades, rapturous goth-rave sequences, protest
  footage and galactic-looking Medellín cityscapes, Montoya hopes this amounts
  to a “cinema of unbelievers” (inspired by Colombian neorealist Víctor Gaviria,
  who cameos here as a taxi driver). But his ambitions go even further: he
  aspires to make work that is truly transgressive, crossing boundaries as
  fluidly as his spectrophiliac squad break gender lines. Anhell69 blurs the
  divisions of reality and fiction effectively enough – but it’s debatable how
  feasible Montoya’s radicalism is in constructing an alternative future. Many
  of the quixotic hopes expressed here are tackily banal: “I want to be
  Hollywood’s bitch!” declares one reveller. The traumatic past hems these night
  folk in as impassably as the surrounding mountains; it’s striking how many
  talk, in the absence of a viable future, about simply existing in the present
  moment. New horizons might be elusive – but Montoya strives hard in this
  fanciful and impassioned piece of cine-protest to create a breach for his
  tribe to see one. • Anhell69 is on True Story from 5 September. • In the UK
