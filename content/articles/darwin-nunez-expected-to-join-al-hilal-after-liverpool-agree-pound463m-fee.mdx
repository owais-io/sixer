  Liverpool have agreed a fee of €53m (£46.3m) plus add-ons with Al-Hilal for
  Darwin Núñez. The Uruguay international is expected to complete a move to the
  Saudi Pro League once personal terms have been finalised. Núñez was interested
  in a transfer to Saudi Arabia in January, when Liverpool rejected £60m from
  Al-Nassr as they prioritised winning the Premier League. The player and his
  representatives reiterated their desire for a move this summer. Núñez made
  some important contributions to Liverpool’s successful pursuit of the title
  but started only eight Premier League games last season and struggled to adapt
  to Arne Slot’s tactics. Liverpool had hoped to recoup £60m for the 26-year-old
  and rejected a bid from Napoli earlier in the window. The Anfield club paid an
  initial £65m to sign Núñez from Benfica in 2022 with add-ons taking the deal
  to a potential club record £85m at the time. Despite becoming a popular figure
  at Anfield, he did not meet expectations under Slot or his predecessor, Jürgen
  Klopp. Liverpool will pursue another attacking option if, as anticipated,
  Núñez signs for Al-Hilal. The club’s bid of £110m plus add-ons for Alexander
  Isak remains on Newcastle’s table. Any replacement for Núñez – and Liverpool
  have also lost Diogo Jota and Luis Díaz from their title-winning squad – must
  have the quality to start and represent fair market value. Isak again trained
  alone at Newcastle on Thursday and will play no part in this weekend’s Sela
  Cup at St James’ Park, where Newcastle face Espanyol on Friday night and
  Atlético Madrid on Saturday afternoon. The Sweden striker is believed to have
  met Eddie Howe on Wednesday afternoon after a solitary training session timed
  to avoid a club barbecue involving the families of players and staff to which
  Isak was not invited. Newcastle’s manager has said players need “to earn the
  right” to train with his first team and that anyone exhibiting “poor
  behaviour” would not be offered the privilege of working with the squad. It
  seems Isak’s decision to skip Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Singapore and
  South Korea while attempting to force a move to Liverpool has left Howe
  distinctly unimpressed. There is a growing sense Isak will end up at Anfield
  but Newcastle will not sell him until they have at least one replacement. A
  deal for Brentford’s Yoane Wissa is expected to be sealed once the London club
  find a new striker, and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas
  Jackson are among other forwards on Howe’s shortlist. Liverpool have spent
  almost £300m on players this summer, including add-ons, but will have recouped
  £251m in sales since the summer of 2024 should the Núñez deal go through.
  Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa could also be sold.
