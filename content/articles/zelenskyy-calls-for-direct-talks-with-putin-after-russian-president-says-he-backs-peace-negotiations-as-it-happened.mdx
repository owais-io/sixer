  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  called for direct talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin instead of
  limited technical talks by officials, saying “we understand who makes the
  decisions in Russia” (14:23). His comments came after Putin said he wanted “a
  lasting and stable peace,” but offered no sign that he is willing to make any
  concessions and reasserted his targets in Ukraine and bragged about Russian
  troops advancing on the frontline (13:46, 13:56, 16:45). Earlier today,
  Ukraine confirmed that 31 people died as a result of a recent Russian attack
  on Kyiv, with over 150 injured (10:24). A meeting of the UN security council
  on the situation in Ukraine was planned for later today. Elsewhere, Germany
  confirmed it was working on moving first elements of the Patriot missile
  system into Ukraine “in the coming days” (11:43, 12:33). And that’s all from
  me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions,

  anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, with sirens wailing across the
  country’s capital and traffic coming to a halt to commemorate the largest
  military effort taken by a European resistance movement during the second
  world war. Every year, the entire city take part in dozens of events around
  the anniversary, joined by dwindling number of veterans in attendance, with
  the Warsaw Uprising Museum playing a central role to the proceedings. Europe’s
  top court questioned the legitimacy of the “safe countries” list Italy uses to
  send migrants to Albania and fast-track their asylum claims, in a fresh blow
  to a key plank of the government’s migration policy, Reuters reported.
  Conservative prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s office, in a statement, called
  the court ruling “surprising” and said it “weakens policies to combat mass
  illegal immigration and defend national borders.” Reuters noted that the
  Luxembourg-based ECJ said Italy is authorised to fast-track asylum rejections
  for nationals coming from countries on a “safe” list – a principle at the
  heart of the Albania scheme. It also said Italy is free to decide which
  countries are “safe”, but also warned that such a designation should meet
  strict legal standards and allow applicants and courts to access and challenge
  the supporting evidence. The ECJ said that a country might not be classified
  “safe” if it does not offer adequate protection to its entire population,
  effectively agreeing with Italian judges that had raised this issue last year,
  Reuters said. The Lithuanian army has found a drone, believed to be
  Russian-made, that entered Lithuania from Belarusian airspace earlier this
  week, amid concerns about growing Russian provocations. AFP noted that the
  drone entered Lithuania in the early hours of Monday, with members of the
  public recording its flight over parts of the country’s capital Vilnius before
  it disappeared. The military said in a statement that it believed it to be a
  Gerbera decoy drone, which it uses during its invasion of Ukraine with the aim
  to overhelm and distract air defences, AFP said. The drone was found in the
  Gaiziunai military training grounds, near a town that hosts the international
  Nato battalion. A similar incident happened earlier this month, with some the
  country’s leaders getting moved to bomb shelters in response. France said it
  could not seize women’s contraception products estimated to be worth $9.7m
  that the United States plans to destroy, after media reports suggested the
  stockpile would be incinerated in the country. The contraceptives – intended
  for some of the world’s poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa
  – were bought by the US foreign aid agency USAID under former president Joe
  Biden. The administration of Biden’s successor Donald Trump, which has slashed
  USAID and pursued anti-abortion policies, confirmed last month it planned to
  destroy the contraceptives, which have been stored in a warehouse in the
  Belgian city of Geel. France’s government has come under pressure to save the
  contraceptives, with women’s rights groups calling the US decision “insane”.
  But France’s health ministry told AFP today there was no legal way for it to
  intervene. The health ministry told AFP that the government had “examined the
  courses of action available to us, but unfortunately there is no legal basis
  for intervention by a European health authority, let alone the French national
  drug safety authority, to recover these medical products. “Since
  contraceptives are not drugs of major therapeutic interest, and in this case
  we are not facing a supply shortage, we have no means to requisition the
  stocks,” it added. Let’s quickly catch up on other European news today. in
  Kyiv Vladimir Putin has said he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine
  but given no indication that he is willing to make any concessions to achieve
  it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and
  destruction across Ukraine. “We need a lasting and stable peace on solid
  foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the
  security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a
  week before a new deadline imposed by Donald Trump for hostilities to cease.
  Trump has said if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement to end the
  war by next Friday, 8 August, he will impose a package of economic sanctions
  on Russia. Before he took office, Trump had promised to end the war in 24
  hours, but since he became president his repeated overtures to Putin have
  achieved minimal results. In recent weeks, Trump has markedly changed his
  rhetoric on the conflict, appearing less conciliatory to Putin and more
  amenable to enhanced support for Ukraine. He called Russia’s continued attacks
  on civilian areas “disgusting” on Thursday. Last month Trump said he was
  “disappointed” with Putin. “We’ll have a great conversation. I’ll say: ‘That’s
  good, I’ll think we’re close to getting it done,’ and then he’ll knock down a
  building in Kyiv,” he told the BBC. Seemingly referencing Trump’s comments,
  Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all
  disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general
  rule.” The death toll from a series of Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early
  hours of Thursday rose sharply on Friday, to 31, after rescuers found more
  than a dozen bodies in the rubble of an apartment block that had collapsed
  after one of the strikes. There were five children among the dead, including a
  two-year-old, while 159 people were wounded in the attack, one of the worst to
  hit the Ukrainian capital in more than three years of full-scale war. As to
  Putin’s claims that Russian army is advancing in Ukraine, an AFP analysis of
  data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War, or ISW, appears to
  confirm that claim. AFP said that Russia’s military advance accelerated for a
  fourth straight month in July, with greatest gains since November. In one
  month, the Russian army took 713 square kilometres (275 square miles) of
  Ukrainian territory, while the Ukrainians reclaimed 79 square kilometres, the
  analysis said. This has resulted in a net gain of 634 square kilometres
  compared with 588 square kilometres in June, 507 square kilometres in May, 379
  square kilometres in April, and 240 square kilometres in March. These figures
  include territories fully or partially controlled by Russia and those claimed
  by it. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has just disclosed that he spoke with UK prime
  minister Keir Starmer, discussing the need to scale up drone production and
  associated financial needs, and to move on sanctions. The conversation started
  with Starmer’s condolences for the Russian attack on Kyiv, which killed 32,
  and their discussion on “how to stop the killings, provide greater protection
  for our people, and force Russia to end this war.” The Ukrainian president
  said that, despite bullish rhethoric coming from Moscow, “Russia genuinely
  fears” sanctions, “no matter how hard it pretends that it couldn’t care less.”
  “Sanctions are undoubtedly working – and there will be more. We are working
  with everyone on coordinated restrictive measures.” Zelenskyy also said he
  spoke with Starmer about “coordination of actions” with US under Trump and
  “possible formats for peace negotiations at the level of leaders.” He ended:
  “We are also preparing for active diplomatic engagement with our partners in
  Europe and the United States. We aligned our positions ahead of upcoming
  international events.” Following Zelenskyy’s comments, his most senior aide
  Andriy Yermak said in his trademark blunt style that “it’s long past time for
  Russians to move from empty talks and living in a fantasy world to facing
  reality.” He said that “a meeting of leaders is possible – it’s Russia that
  doesn’t want it.” “Too many statements about ‘wanting peace’ while missile
  strikes continue — and not a single real step toward peace from Moscow. Where
  is the ceasefire the United States proposed back in March – the one we agreed
  to? President [Trump] is doing a great deal to achieve peace. President
  Zelenskyy shares the principle of peace through strength. It’s time for Russia
  to stop lying on the bench and start getting specific.” Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Putin’s comments, repeating that Ukraine is
  ready for talks at the leaders’ level “at any time.” “We have heard the
  statements coming out of Russia. If these are signals of a genuine willingness
  to end the war with dignity and establish a truly lasting peace – and not
  merely an attempt to buy more time for war or delay sanctions – then Ukraine
  once again reaffirms its readiness to meet at the level of leaders at any
  time.” He continued by explaining why a direct meeting is needed to conduct
  talks. “We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this
  war. The whole world understands this too,” he said. “Ukraine proposes to move
  from exchanges of statements and technical-level meetings to talks between
  leaders. The United States has proposed this. Ukraine had supported it. What
  is needed is Russia’s readiness.” Zelenskyy also pointedly thanked US
  president Donald Trump for his work on ending the conflict, seemingly
  acknowledging how much depends on his response to Putin’s latest attacks. In
  further lines from Putin, he also said that if anyone was disappointed in the
  outcome of peace talks to date, that was a consequence of inflated
  expectations. Instead, he insisted, further conversations should be conducted
  “without cameras and in a calm atmosphere.“ Putin also repeated a claim that
  Russia captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar, which is denied by Ukraine.
  Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow’s goals in Ukraine
  remained unchanged and claimed that Russian troops are advancing “along entire
  frontline” in Ukraine. In comments reported by Reuters, Putin also said that
  the new deadly Oreshnik missile system is now being mass produced, with first
  deliveries already made to the army. At the same time, he said he hoped peace
  talks between Russia and Ukraine would continue, but warned against inflated
  expectations as to what can be realistically achieved. He also insisted that
  the issue of the war would need to be addressed “in the context of European
  security as a whole,” which in the past was linked to his expansive security
  demands relating to large parts of central and eastern Europe. Putin has been
  talking to the media alongside Belarussian autocratic president Alexander
  Lukashenko. We are getting a bit more detail on the Patriot deliveries from
  Germany, from the defence ministry’s press note. Defence minister Boris
  Pistorius said Friday’s announcement “shows once again that Germany is by far
  Ukraine’s strongest supporter when it comes to air defence”. “Germany is doing
  the groundwork to quickly meet Ukraine’s urgent current needs,” he said. The
  note added that Germany also wanted to “combine this delivery with an appeal
  to our partners to promptly provide additional systems.” AFP noted that aside
  from Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden have said they are
  willing to finance the systems under the deal. Ukrainian defence minister
  Denis Shmyhal said in a statement that Germany will deliver two Patriot
  systems to Ukraine, starting with additional launchers “in the coming days.”
  “In a second phase, over the next two to three months, further system
  components will be handed over,” he said. Shmyhal, former prime minister, said
  that the move was “the result of joint efforts of the US, Germany and other
  Nato countries,” as he thanked his German and US counterparts, Boris Pistorius
  and Pete Hegseth. “More air defence capabilities for Ukraine means more
  innocent lives saved!” he said. Meanwhile, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s top
  aide, said he spoke with senior security officials from the UK, France,
  Germany and Italy this morning, discussing the aftermath of the Russian attack
  on Kyiv and next steps in relations with the US. “I am grateful to my
  colleagues for their sincere words of sympathy to our nation in connection
  with the latest barbaric shelling of Kyiv. There are already 31 dead,
  including five children. Russia continues its terror against civilians. We
  must strengthen our joint response,” he said. The officials confirmed
  “positive signals” from the White House regarding its planned response to
  Russia, including “sanctions on Russian oil and secondary tariffs.” They also
  discussed “the preparation of a historic bilateral agreement between Ukraine
  and the US” on security, which would be co-financed by European allies.
  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just issued another update, saying
  that 31 people were confirmed dead, including five children, as the search and
  rescue operations were concluded this morning. He said: “Once again, this vile
  strike by Russia demonstrates the need for increased pressure on Moscow and
  additional sanctions. No matter how much the Kremlin denies their
  effectiveness, sanctions do work – and they must be strengthened. They must
  target everything that enables such attacks to continue. It is also crucial
  that the world does not remain silent about them. I thank everyone who has
  supported our people. We value the fact that President Trump, European
  leaders, and other partners clearly see what is happening and condemn Russia.”
  Zelenskyy added that in July alone, Russia used over 3,800 dones and 260
  missiles, including 128 ballistic, against Ukraine. “This can only be stopped
  through joint efforts – by America, Europe, and other global actors. Every
  engagement matters. Every day matters,” he said. Ukrainian prime minister
  Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed that the death doll has risen to 28 this morning,
  after two more bodies, including of a two-year-old child, were retrieved from
  the rubbles. She said: “Entire families murdered in their homes, including
  children. The world possesses every instrument required to ensure Russia is
  brought to justice. What is lacking is not power — but will.” The death toll
  from Thursday’s Russian attack on Kyiv has risen to 26 with over 150 injured,
  making it one of the deadliest attacks on the capital since the start of the
  full-scale war in 2022. Responding to the attack, Ukraine called for an
  emergency meeting of the UN security council this afternoon as it seeks to
  unite its allies and ramp up pressure on Russia to end the war. Ukrainian
  foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said the meeting, scheduled for afternoon
  European time, will be a platform for countries to make it clear where they
  stand. “Putin rejects peace efforts and wants to prolong his war. And the
  world has the necessary strength to stop him – by united pressure and
  principled position in favor of a full, immediate, and unconditional
  ceasefire,” he said. Andriy Yermak, the most senior aide to president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did not mince his words reacting to the news this morning
  as he spoke of “Russian murderers.” US president Donald Trump, who recently
  set a new deadline for Russia to end the invasion until 8 August, told
  journalists that it was “disgusting what they are doing.” “We’re going to put
  sanctions. I don’t know that sanctions bother him,” the US president said,
  referring to Putin. US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who currently is in
  Israel, will be told to visit Russia next, he added. Elsewhere, I will be
  keeping an eye on the latest on the EU-US trade, after Trump signed his
  executive order, but delayed the effects of sanctions by a week, until 7
  August. You can follow market reactions on our business blog, too. I will
  bring you all key updates from across Europe here. It’s Friday, 1 August 2025,
  it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
