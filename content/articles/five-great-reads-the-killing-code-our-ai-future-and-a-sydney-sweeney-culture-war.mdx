  Happy Saturday! Pro-Palestine protesters marched across the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge nearly a week ago. It was a moment in history – the torrential rain and
  enormous crowd numbers – and our reporters covered it brilliantly and
  sensitively. Just like today’s first read. With that, let’s get on. 1. The
  killing code A cipher hidden in a colonial settler’s diaries from the 1850s
  has confirmed a confronting chapter of Australia’s colonial past. It’s in this
  impressive and compelling interactive from Guardian Australia – where our
  journalists and historians decode the truth of a dark history that Yamatji
  people already know all too well. The killing code: In his journals, Major
  Logue used a modified form of masonic code known as “pigpen” to hide the
  killings of Aboriginal people. In part one of this series, readers can toggle
  the code to reveal the hidden atrocities he wrote of while he lived in
  Geraldton, Western Australia. ‘Colonial silence’: Now, the descendants of the
  victims of the massacres, and the descendants of the perpetrators of colonial
  violence, want to break the shame and silence. 2. Materialist girl: Celine
  Song For a short time, before she became an Oscar-nominated writer-director,
  Celine Song worked as a matchmaker. Her clients would tell her things “they
  would never admit to their therapist”, but were painstakingly alike in their
  requests: tall, rich, great body and hair. Song wanted to make a film about
  the experience but realised the clients were boring. The most interesting part
  about the modern dating world, for her, was actually class and wealth. Past
  Lives: Song’s debut film about loves lost and rekindled, also inspired by the
  director’s love life, is a must-see (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw gave it
  five stars). How long will it take to read: four minutes. 3. When the expert
  becomes the patient When a cycling accident involving a lorry crushed Jim
  Ashworth-Beaumont’s lungs and liver, and left him without a right arm, he
  thought he was going to die. When he survived the unimaginable, he became part
  of a radical trial for amputees. It just so happened that he was also an
  experienced clinician in prosthetics, making him the perfect guinea pig. ***
  “You couldn’t have made up a better candidate, but I wasn’t going to tell him
  until I knew he would survive.” – Edmund Fitzgerald O’Connor, plastic surgeon.
  How long will it take to read: nine minutes. 4. A tech CEO’s take on the
  future of AI If Demis Hassabis had his way, AI would have been “left in the
  lab for longer”. As chief executive of Google’s AI DeepMind, his team would
  have “done more things like AlphaFold” – the AI tool predicting protein’s 3D
  structure – or “maybe cured cancer”, he tells Steve Rose. Instead, the world
  is already getting a feel for AI. And while the unknowns remain large and ever
  gloomy, Hassabis is “cautiously optimistic” that we can achieve radical
  abundance. What is ‘radical abundance’? Hassabis believes the more productive
  AI can be to society, the more society can prosper. “Of course, we’ve got to
  make sure it gets distributed fairly, but that’s more of a political
  question,” he says. How long will it take to read: five and a half minutes. 5.
  Stuck on Sydney Sweeney This one is for all the readers rubbing their heads as
  to why they saw a blond bombshell grace our front page more than once this
  week. Adrian Horton is on the case, as she expertly explains how the
  27-year-old US actor Sydney Sweeney has started a culture war over recent
  viral ads. Hollywood up-and-comer: it involves jeans, boobs, voting Republican
  and money. Enjoy! How long will it take to read: three and a half minutes.
  Further reading: and then you must read Marina Hyde’s take on the controversy
  – she thinks it’s a showbiz masterclass. Sign up If you would like to receive
