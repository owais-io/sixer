  Ken Hinkley arrived at Port Adelaide as a breath of fresh air for a club on
  life support. The players were still to recover from a grand final humiliation
  five years earlier. The fans had deserted the club in droves. Tarpaulins were
  spread over the seats where supporters should have been at home games, which
  only brought more attention to the Power’s woes. “This club is in a renewal
  stage, there’s no doubt about that,” Hinkley said during his first press
  conference as Power coach in late 2012. “We know what we’ve got to do, and we
  know where we’ve got to go.” In their first season under Hinkley, Port
  Adelaide might have been satisfied with simply earning respect. They won their
  first five games under their new coach, finished in the top eight for the
  first time in six years and stunned Collingwood in an elimination final at the
  MCG. The club was able to tear up the tarps as fans returned amid strong signs
  of progress on the field. Port Adelaide went a step further in 2014 and
  reached a preliminary final. A final-term fightback fell less than a goal
  short as eventual premiers Hawthorn hung on in a thriller. The pain of missing
  out on a grand final berth could at least be dulled by results over two years
  suggesting that Hinkley was steering the side in the right direction, with a
  return to the biggest stage again on the horizon. But the Power never did make
  it to the promised land under Hinkley, whose 13-year tenure will end on Friday
  night. They failed to even reach a decider as three more preliminary final
  defeats, including a crushing loss to Sydney last year, became a stain on the
  coach’s record. The perpetual heartbreak was enough for club power brokers to
  decide earlier this year that it was time to move Hinkley on, only with a
  season-long farewell tour still to come. Six months later, Hinkley will depart
  the Power holding the unwanted record for the most VFL/AFL games coached
  without reaching a grand final. He has also coached the fourth-most games
  without winning a premiership. Seven finals campaigns and four preliminary
  finals appearances in his first 12 seasons as Power coach, were not enough for
  Hinkley to save his job, and will continue to cloud whether his reign can be
  considered a success. The Power had their fair share of triumphs under Hinkley
  as they won 173 of their 296 matches with a match against Gold Coast still to
  play. The winning percentage of 58.5% is better than modern-day coaching
  greats like Alastair Clarkson and Damien Hardwick. But that pair made their
  better years count for more and share seven premierships, while Hinkley and
  the Power remained competitive but continued to fall narrowly short. The 2020
  flag is perhaps the one that got away, after Port Adelaide sat on top of the
  ladder for the entire home-and-away season but lost a preliminary final on
  home turf to Richmond by a goal. This season has turned into the Power’s worst
  under Hinkley, with eight wins the fewest in a single campaign. The side also
  suffered their four heaviest defeats across his tenure as the pressure
  surrounding the succession plan with Josh Carr seemed to become too much for
  Hinkley to bear. The usually combative coach started the year bristling at
  suggestions that the handover would affect him and the players, but in the
  past week has revealed a sense of relief that the end is near. The Power did
  not achieve all that they hoped for under Hinkley and even he now concedes it
  is time for him to go. But the lack of silverware, or even a grand final
  appearance, should not mean his 13 years at the helm are considered a failure.
  Hinkley’s legacy at Port Adelaide is as much about rebuilding a club and
  reminding us that – especially in a sport where there is only one winner –
  there can be different versions of success. “Didn’t make a grand final, didn’t
  win one,” Hinkley said this week in his last midweek press conference as Power
  coach. “That’s probably what it will be. That’s the reality of football. We
  built the footy club up, we have done really well with lots of things –
  ultimately we didn’t quite get to the end.” This is an extract from Guardian
