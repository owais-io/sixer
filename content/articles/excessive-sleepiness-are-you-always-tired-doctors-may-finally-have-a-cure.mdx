  Name: Excessive daytime sleepiness. Age: First described in 1976. Appearance:
  You, asleep in the clothes you went to work in. Surely it’s natural to feel a
  bit sleepy during the day? Yes, but that isn’t what this is. The important
  part of the equation is the “excessive”. If you’re always falling asleep
  outside bedtime hours, that’s a problem. Oh, you really do mean excessive.
  Yes. And it’s a condition recognised by the NHS, with the medical name
  hypersomnia. Narcolepsy? No, narcolepsy is a neurological condition that can
  cause people to suddenly fall into deep sleeps. Hypersomnia is where you’re so
  tired that you keep drifting off. Now I’m worried that I may have it. Well,
  answer me this: do you eat a lot of cheese, gherkins and smoked meat? Now you
  mention it, I do maintain a primarily charcuterie-based diet. Well, that might
  be your problem. Researchers from Brigham and Women’s hospital in Boston have
  claimed that hypersomnia may have a lot to do with our metabolism. Worrying.
  Not really. The researchers say that the metabolite tyramine is a factor.
  Tyramine is found in overripe food, aged cheese, smoked meat and some
  alcoholic drinks. Wow, medieval kings must have been absolutely knackered all
  the time. It’s suggested that if people feel constantly sleepy, they should
  ditch these foods and adopt a diet of seeds, nuts and vegetable oils. And the
  result is that you’ll have more hours in the day to eat all this boring food?
  Exactly. Don’t dismiss hypersomnia, though. There is a test you can take, the
  Epworth Sleepiness Scale, to discover if your napping is a problem or not. I
  just scored really highly on it. The NHS recommends that you should see your
  GP if you fall asleep during the day too often. Why bother? I’ll just lay off
  the gouda and everything will be dandy. Out of interest, do you snore a lot?
  How rude! Maybe. If you do, you may have sleep apnoea, and your daytime
  sleepiness could be down to your inability to reach a point of deep,
  restorative sleep at night. Also, are you depressed? Isn’t everyone? That’s
  another potential cause of hypersomnia. What if I’m depressed because someone
  from Boston just told me that I can’t eat so much antipasti? Oh dear, that
  means you’re trapped in a rare but dangerous hypersomnia loop. Maybe just give
  in to it. Nothing wrong with an impromptu nap, is there? I’m a commercial
  airline pilot. Forget everything I just said. Eat these seeds immediately. Do
  say: “Smoked meat causes excessive daytime sleepiness.” Don’t say: “And also
  cures it, if you use a Peperami to prop your eyelids open.” • This article was
  amended on 21 August 2025 because an earlier version suggested that it is
  always the case that narcolepsy causes people to suddenly fall into deep
  sleeps. To clarify: that can be one of the symptoms of narcolepsy, but not
  everyone with the condition has the same symptoms.
