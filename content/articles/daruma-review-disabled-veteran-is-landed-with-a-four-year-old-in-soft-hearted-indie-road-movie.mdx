  Daruma review – disabled veteran is landed with a four-year-old in
  soft-hearted indie road movie
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-27T06:00:28Z'
bodyText: >-
  This low-budget, US-made comedy-drama is full of sincerity and good intentions
  but that doesn’t quite get off the hook for its egregious sentimentality and
  copious cliches. But the well-directed (though somewhat artless) performances
  and competent assembly make it palatable enough to pass the time, especially
  if you have a particular interest in stories about living with a disability.
  The protagonist is surly war veteran and wheelchair-user Patrick (Tobias
  Forrest, who uses a wheelchair in real life). When he’s not drunk, in a strip
  club or both, he’s down at the social security office bickering with the
  staff. (The fact that there’s still an office he can wheel into betrays the
  fact this was made well before the Trump administration and Doge started
  gutting the agency.) One day, a pair of social workers show up and inform
  Patrick that he’s the father of a four-year-old girl, Camilla (Victoria Scott,
  adorable), who he never knew existed. Her mother has just died from cancer,
  and Camilla’s options are limited to either staying with Patrick (her upkeep
  will be paid for by a life insurance policy that kicks out $4k a month),
  moving in with her grandparents on the other side of the country, or going
  into foster care. Patrick agrees to take in his daughter, but of course he has
  a learning curve as steep and smooth as a shard of glass. As luck would have
  it, comely children’s furniture store assistant Anna (Abigail Hawk) is keen to
  offer some pointers, although her attraction to Patrick seems a little
  unfeasible given how grumpy and bad at sexting he is. Eventually, he also gets
  help from his equally grumpy nextdoor neighbour Robert (John W Lawson), who,
  like Patrick, is living with a disability. When Patrick decides he’s not
  responsible enough to raise Camilla, Robert is the only person with a car whom
  he can persuade to drive him and the kid across country to the aforementioned
  grandparents. This affords the film a chance to indulge in all the indie road
  movie cliches, and forge some new ones of its own, which fills out the feature
  length until it’s time for hugs, apologies and last act reconciliations,
  wrapped up with still shots over the credits showing everything worked out
  hunky dory. • Daruma is on digital platforms from 1 September.
