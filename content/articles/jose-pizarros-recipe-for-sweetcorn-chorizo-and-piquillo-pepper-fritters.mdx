  It’s easy to forget that ingredients such as corn, peppers and even the
  pimentón in our chorizo all came from the Americas in the 15th century. Many
  of them first took root in Europe in Extremadura, where I’m from. In La Vera,
  peppers were smoked and ground into what became pimentón de la Vera and is now
  part of our food culture. These fritters, which are simple, quick and full of
  flavour, bring together all these ingredients with long journeys behind them
  and a solid place in the modern Spanish kitchen. Sweetcorn, chorizo and
  piquillo pepper fritters Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Makes About 12 125g cured
  chorizo, skinned and finely diced 75g jarred piquillo peppers, drained and
  finely chopped 2 corn cobs, kernels shaved off with a big sharp knife 125g
  plain flour 1 tsp baking powder Sea salt and black pepper 2 large eggs, beaten
  160ml whole milk Olive oil, for frying Put the chorizo, peppers and corn in a
  large bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and toss to coat. Season
  generously, then add the eggs and milk, and mix again to combine. Heat a good
  layer of oil in a large nonstick frying pan, then, working in batches so as
  not to overcrowd the pan, drop in spoonfuls of the fritter mixture and fry for
  a minute or two on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on
  kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the rest of the
  fritters. Serve the fritters warm, either just as they are or with some creme
  fraiche or a little tomato salsa for dipping.
