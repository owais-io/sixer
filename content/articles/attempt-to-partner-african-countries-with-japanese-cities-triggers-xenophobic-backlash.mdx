  backlash

  An attempt to promote friendship between Japan and countries in Africa has
  transformed into a xenophobic row about migration after inaccurate media
  reports suggested the scheme would lead to a “flood of immigrants”. The
  controversy erupted after the Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA,
  said this month it had designated four Japanese cities as “Africa hometowns”
  for partner countries in Africa: Mozambique, Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. The
  programme, announced at the end of an international conference on African
  development in Yokohama, will involve personnel exchanges and events to foster
  closer ties between the four regional Japanese cities – Imabari, Kisarazu,
  Sanjo and Nagai – and the African nations. Media coverage in the four
  countries, and Japanese-language references to the articles, have been blamed
  for triggering an ugly backlash on social media in Japan, along with a wave of
  angry calls and emails to the Japanese cities’ offices. Some critics appeared
  to believe that “hometown” status meant that people from the African countries
  would be given special permission to live and work in their Japanese partner
  cities. “If immigrants come flooding in, who is going to take responsibility?”
  said one social media post. One post on X claiming that Kisarazu was
  “seriously considering handing over the city to Africans” attracted 4.6m
  views. The four cities have received thousands of complaints from confused
  residents. “Our team of 15 officials spent a whole day handling hundreds of
  phone calls and thousands of emails from residents,” an official in Sanjo told
  Agence France-Presse. The town has received 350 phone calls and 3,500 emails
  since Monday, the official said, while Imabari has fielded 460 calls and 1,400
  emails from residents asking if the town had adopted a new immigration policy.
  Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said the claims were
  baseless. “There are no plans to promote accepting immigrants or issue special
  visas,” he told reporters. The cities also attempted to set the record
  straight. The mayor of Kisarazu, Yoshikuni Watanabe, pointed out that the city
  had hosted Nigerian athletes during the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic and
  Paralympic Games, adding that project would not lead to “accepting migrants”.
  He added: “Our initiatives will involve cooperating in the education of young
  people based on discipline through baseball and softball, and it’s not a
  programme that will lead to relocation or immigration.” The mayor of Sanjo,
  Ryo Takizawa, said in a statement: “It is not true that the city has requested
  to accept migrants or immigrants from Ghana, and the city has no plans to make
  such a request in the future.” Some attributed the outcry to an article in the
  Tanzania Times that carried the headline “Japan dedicates Nagai city to
  Tanzania.” The word “dedicates” was translated on social media into the
  Japanese word sasageru, which could be interpreted to mean the town was being
  “sacrificed” to Tanzania, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Nigeria’s
  government also appeared to have misunderstood the details of the programme,
  describing Kisarazu as a location open to “Nigerians willing to live and work
  [in Japan]”. Japan’s government, it added, would create a special visa
  category for skilled people from the West African country. Japan’s foreign
  ministry has reportedly asked the Nigerian government to issue a correction,
  while JICA – a government agency – said several media organisations had
  published articles containing “inaccuracies and potentially misleading
  information”. “JICA is currently urging the relevant local media and the
  African government [sic] to promptly correct the inaccuracies contained in
  their coverage,” it said on its website.
